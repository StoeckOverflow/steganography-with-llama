# steganography-with-llama

steganography-with-llama is a Python-based tool that utilizes a large language model (LLAMA) to perform steganography, the art of hiding information within other data, such as images or text. This project allows you to encode and decode secret messages within various media files using the power of advanced natural language processing.

## Usage

To encode a message within a media file:

'''shell
python encode.py --input input_media_file.jpg --output output_media_file.jpg --message "Your secret message goes here"
'''

To decode a hidden message from a media file:

'''shell
python decode.py --input encoded_media_file.jpg
'''

For more advanced options and customization, consult the documentation or run the scripts with the --help flag.
