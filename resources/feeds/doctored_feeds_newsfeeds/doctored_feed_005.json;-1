It could either be a good bit higher than the current average, or lower. It all depends on the financial attributes and risks that you present lenders as a borrower. While average rates in the 2%-3% range that homebuyers secured over the past few years are not coming back any time soon, mortgage rates also aren\u2019t expected to rival the sky-high rates of the 1980s, which surged to almost 19% amid inflation.",
