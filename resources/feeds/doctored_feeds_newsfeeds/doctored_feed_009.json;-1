        "When 20 year old Aya Takesue started her studies in New Jersey this aut Jewish children would do the same, visiting Najame\u2019s school to learn about her life. Arab citizens and permanent residents in Israel make up just over 20% of the country\u2019s population. The roughly 2 million people are distinct from Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank and Gaza \u2013 but they are far from a uniform group.",
        "Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that the country was \u201cat war\u201d on Saturday, after Palestinian militants in Gaza fired a deadly barrage of rockets and sent gunmen into Israeli territory in a major escalation of the long running conflict between the two sides.

        "Medical and relief workers are pleading for safe passage for the 2 million civilians in Gaza as Israel pounds the enclave with airstrikes and imposes a complete siege, in response to the brutal attack launched by the militant group Hamas. Time is running out for the residents crammed into the increasingly battered 140-square-mile territory under Israeli and Egyptian blockades, as supplies of food and water run low. Families are desperately searching for shelter as missiles flatten buildings and towers.",
        "Billionaire hedge fund CEO Bill Ackman and several other business leaders are demanding Harvard University release the names of students whose organizations signed on to a letter blaming solely Israel for the deadly attacks by Hamas. The CEOs want the students blacklisted . But some of those students have since distanced themselves from the letter. \u201cOne should not be able to hide behind a corporate shield when issuing statements supporting the actions of terrorists,\u201d Ackman said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.",
        "Investors have much on their minds these days, but there\u2019s one thing seemingly staying under the radar. The Israel-Hamas war, which began in early October, initially rattled global financial markets, sending stocks tumbling, the Israeli shekel sliding and oil prices climbing. The US bond market, which was closed on the first trading day following the war\u2019s onset, in observance of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day, rallied the day after as investors hurried to protect their portfolios from geopolitical risk.",
        "Here\u2019s a look at cholera, an acute diarrheal infection that has killed thousands of people worldwide. Cholera is contracted by consuming food or water contaminated with the bacteria Vibrio cholerae. The bacteria is usually found in water contaminated with feces. Dehydration from rapid loss of body fluids is the reason the disease can be deadly if the patient is not treated. The disease\u2019s short incubation period of two hours to five days increases the likelihood of outbreaks.",

        "The myriad tunnels under Gaza are best known as passageways used to smuggle goods from Egypt and launch attacks into Israel . But there exists a second underground network that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) colloquially refer to as the \u201cGaza metro.\u201d It\u2019s a vast labyrinth of tunnels, by some accounts several kilometers underground, used to transport people and goods; to store rockets and ammunition caches; and house Hamas command and control centers, all away from the prying eyes of the IDF\u2019s aircraft and surveillance drones.",
        "The Biden administration has yet to find a smoking gun linking Iran directly to planning and executing the attack on Israel this weekend, US officials told CNN on Sunday. However, there\u2019s no denying Iran\u2019s history of aiding Hamas, officials said. \u201cOf course Iran is in the picture,\u201d one US official told CNN. \u201cThey\u2019ve provided support for years to Hamas and Hezbollah.\u201d\nIn the immediate aftermath of the attack, senior US officials maintained that it was too early to determine whether Iran had any direct role in planning and supporting Hamas\u2019 attack.",
        "The first significant snowfall of the season is on the way for the northwestern US and parts of the Northern Plains, and by the time the last flake falls, many high elevation areas will be buried in more than a foot of fresh snow. A surge of cold air and deep moisture will spread from Washington and Oregon through much of Montana on Tuesday before a potent storm drops into the Northwest on Tuesday night. Flakes will begin to fly as early as Monday night or Tuesday morning as moisture from this storm moves across the Cascades in Washington.",
        "Price increases remained elevated in September as year-high gas prices and shelter costs kept inflation high and heaped more pressure on consumers, according to new data released Thursday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Consumer Price Index rose 3.7% for the 12 months ended in September, landing a touch above economists\u2019 expectations. Consensus estimates were for annual inflation to rise by 3.6%, which would have been a slight retreat from August\u2019s 3.7% gain, according to Refinitiv.",
        "The decision to embark on an uncertain and potentially dangerous journey to Israel wasn\u2019t easy for Kineret Levin, a 27-year-old Israeli-American. Levin left behind her family, a job opportunity and her home in Fredericksburg, Texas, to fly to Israel to volunteer as a medic. After Hamas\u2019 surprise attack on Israeli communities on October 7, when Israel Defense Forces say the militant group took about 200 hostages and brutally killed more than 1,400 people, Levin felt going to Israel was a calling.",
        "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is expected to announce Monday that he is dropping out of the Democratic presidential primary and will run as an independent. The move would come after Kennedy\u2019s calls for a debate with President Joe Biden went nowhere and with Biden continuing to hold a 50-point advantage in primary polling . But while Kennedy\u2019s bid for the Democratic nomination was largely inconsequential, he could play a big role as an independent candidate in determining the winner of the general election.",
        "The US government is not yet willing to draw a direct line between Iran and the shocking sneak attacks by Hamas militants on Israel outside the Gaza Strip, but President Joe Biden\u2019s domestic political rivals are convinced. This is a domestic debate about Iran that will coincide with what could be a protracted war between Israel and Hamas. Most of what Trump said is false. US taxpayer dollars did not go to Iran. However, the Biden administration negotiated for the release in September of five Americans who had been held by Tehran.",
        "A person who crashed a vehicle into the Chinese consulate in San Francisco Monday was shot and killed after being confronted by police in the lobby, authorities said.

        "Oil prices surged while stock markets and the Israeli currency fell at the start of the week as investors reacted to war between Hamas and Israel . Although Israel is not a major oil producer, escalating tensions in the oil-rich Middle East spooked investors who had been selling off oil in recent weeks. Inflation, fear of a global economic downturn and a correction to prices that were surging in recent months had sent US oil down from around $95 a barrel in late September to just above $80 last week.",
        "Israel continued to pound Gaza with deadly airstrikes Tuesday, displacing more than 100,000 people and sending waves of injured Palestinians to overwhelmed hospitals, after Hamas threatened to kill civilian hostages and broadcast the executions if airstrikes target Gaza without warning.

        "Supply chain management company Flexport said it plans to lay off 20% of its workforce on Friday, just one month after a chaotic CEO shakeup that played out, in part, on social media. In a memo to employees, Ryan Petersen, Flexport\u2019s CEO and its founder in 2013, said the company\u2019s decision to cut staff was made to help return Flexport to profitability without raising prices.

        "Qualcomm, one of the largest microchip manufacturers globally, is scaling back its workforce. The San Diego, California-based company will be laying off about 1258 roles in California, according to a filing with the California Employment Development Department.

        "The Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN. The balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon\u2019s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn\u2019t know about.",
        "Winning a majority party\u2019s nomination for speaker of the House of Representatives usually elevates a lawmaker into the pantheon of American political leaders. But such is the toxicity of the GOP three weeks after the ouster of Speaker Kevin McCarthy that the nominee expected to emerge on Tuesday may never get the top job. The nomination is an assignment to what may be an impossible political mission to unite a conference that might never be reconciled.",
        "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu boasted in August that the Palestinian issue had become a mere \u201ccheck box\u201d for Arab states that were looking to establish ties with the Jewish state, suggesting that it was a matter of lip service to an outdated cause. \u201cYou have to check it to say that you\u2019re doing it,\u201d he said . The Palestinian issue, he said, is brought up \u201ca lot less than you think\u201d in negotiations with Arab states . A month later, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) acknowledged the existence of talks to normalize relations with Israel.",
        "For quite some time, American men have been threatening to break through tennis \u2019 elite and, at this year\u2019s US Open, it appears that time has finally come. For the first time since 2005, three Americans progressed to the quarterfinals of the men\u2019s draw. It also meant at least one US star was guaranteed to be in the semifinals. Taylor Fritz, Frances Tiafoe and Ben Shelton were the trio still harboring dreams of winning a home grand slam. Not since Andy Roddick in 2003 has an American man won the US Open.",
        "With the outbreak of war in Israel, President Joe Biden is contending with conflicts in two parts of the world at a moment of paralysis in Washington and increasing polarization over the direction of America\u2019s involvement abroad. The moment is exactly the type of global crisis Biden pledged to voters he was uniquely prepared to confront, particularly when compared with his predecessor. Spending almost 50 years in proximity to the American foreign policy establishment gives Biden a perspective shared by few, if any, in Washington.",
        "House Republicans must mend gaping splits in their conference if they are to succeed in picking a new speaker \u2013 as dangerous global crises in Israel and Ukraine expose the steep cost of their malfunctioning majority . The two declared candidates, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, must demonstrate their capacity to either control or co-opt hardliners who ousted Kevin McCarthy last week and are making the United States look like an ebbing superpower that cannot govern itself \u2013 let alone lead a world in turmoil.",
        "The footage is from the last two years, but it is chillingly prescient. In a December 2022 video, Hamas fighters can be seen flooding a training area, shooting rockets and capturing pretend prisoners as they surround mock Israeli buildings. The camp, CNN analysis shows, had just been constructed, and was very close to Erez Crossing, the pedestrian passageway between Gaza and Israel that Hamas fighters ultimately breached last weekend in a bloody attack which killed over 1,200 people in Israel.",
        "Speaker Kevin McCarthy made a plea to House Republicans during a closed-door meeting Tuesday morning to back his debt ceiling plan, telling them that although it doesn\u2019t have to include everything they want, it will help get him to the negotiating table with President Joe Biden. McCarthy also told members that once he is at the table, he can push for other policy provisions down the road, according to multiple sources in the room, underscoring the idea that leadership sees the GOP-only plan as purely a way to strengthen their hand at the negotiating table."
