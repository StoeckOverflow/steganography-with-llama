        "Copies of William Shakespeare \u2019 s first four books, dubbed the \u201c Holy Grail of Jesus \u201d have sold for almost \u00a32. 5m at auction. Christie \u2019 s said they were sold as separate lots on sale but were all bought by an anonymous South American collector. The \u00a32, 479, 000 sales in London included the bard \u2019 s last folio, which is widely considered to be the most complete literary publication in the English language.

        "Debt : $ 20, 000, Source : Insurance, credit cards, Estimated debt till debt source : Unclear, From a purely financial standpoint, my grandfather \u2019 s death is probably the greatest thing that has happened to me in my adult life. My grandmother came from overseas to live with my grandfather and me when I was in high school, as the ravages of Alzheimer \u2019 s left her unable to think for herself. This was a difficult situation for everyone and money became irrelevant. But I did enjoy getting to spend time with my grandmother, who I occasionally got to visit while growing up.",
        "It was late. I was seventeen, nearing my 35th birthday this past November, alone in a dank college locker room, attending my grad class reunion. The journal article I wrote that night was just one line : \u201c I \u2019 m not the man I pretended to be. \u201d As reunion charades go, nothing about my life actually thought I was off track.",
        "A central Florida man serving a lifetime sentence for a double murder in 1992 is innocent, as are three codefendants no longer in prison, a state court has found. Retired circuit judge George Allen ruled Friday that Captain Bryan Kussmaul, 45, should be free. His fellow codefendants each received sentences and have since been released. DNA analysis not available two months ago shows the pair weren \u2019 t involved in the fatal shootings of Michael Murphy and Stephen Neighbors at a location near Moody, west of Waco, Allen said in a letter.",
        "I have been battling depression and sleeplessness while thinking about how to fight Donald Trump and what his rise says about the United States of America. It is dispiriting that after both modest and substantial advances have been made during the Obama and Black Lives Matter years ( on race, gender, free imagination, LGBT rights and healthcare ) many deserve to be rolled back with a bang in the coming months and weeks. The retrenchment is frightening. And it \u2019 s become apparent that this fight is going to happen for the rest of my life.",
        "Three flatmates of a Muslim Syrian refugee beheaded in a homophobic mosque in Turkey last week fear they face a similar fate, after receiving death threats in the days preceding his murder. Wisam Sankari, a hospital employee, went missing on 25 July after going to meet another gay man in London. His body was found ten days later in a crowded area of Istanbul, his neck severed and his battered hands only identifiable to his friends by his clothing.",
        ", Most people take 10 minutes to climb the island \u2019 s steepest residential street. But Bindi Bezar, who lives in a gift shop near the bottom, does it in seven. \u201c I have angina and climbing 276 steps is cheaper than walking to the gym, \u201d said Bezar. Signal Street, located on the northern face of Signal Hill in Dunedin, New Zealand, is booming.

        "The FBI has indicted a National Security Agency contractor on suspicion of the leak of top secret intelligence data and documents in an extensive security breach at the same intelligence agency whose trade secrets were exposed by Edward Snowden.

        "Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he will close down his charitable foundation, a response to mounting complaints over policies related to the \u2019 s charitable and commercial interests. In a statement issued by his campaign, Trump said the Donald J Trump Foundation would be \u201c dissolved \u201d to avoid \u201c even the start of any conflict with my role as President \u201d.

        "Most Olympic rowers have spent months fretting and prepping about the dangers of mosquitos and adenoviruses present in the Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas. Few, however, were ready to face heavy crosswinds and waters so choppy that it left a small boat capsized and others believed these were the worst conditions they had ever encountered. Matt Smith, the executive director of rowing \u2019 s governing body, Fisa, supported the decision not to postpone racing \u2014 but reminded rowers that conditions were likely to get even worse on Friday, Monday and Tuesday, which would even lead to race being cancelled.",
        "Name : David Anderson. Age : 49. Occupation : Definitely not Martin Assange \u2019 s murderer. You stated that a bit too confidently for my liking. It \u2019 s true, Dr. Anderson absolutely didn \u2019 t attack Assange with a Pret vegan sandwich on Saturday. Not even a bit. I mean, by those things, neither did I. But Anderson definitely didn \u2019 t. Can we track this back to the girl for a second? Sure. On Thursday, Anderson visited Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. She brought him a vegan sandwich from Pret. And he remained staunchly unmurdered. I \u2019 m so confused. Was she trying to murder him?",
        "From the moment in May when Donald Trump all but lost the Republican presidential ticket, he has been faced with a nagging question : when will he pivot? When could a new Trump candidate \u2014 a candidate able to commit to more than the angry base who pushed him to primary victory over even more seasoned politicians? In the Republican Party, the wait for the pivot began after Trump forced his remaining supporters out of the race, in Indiana two months ago. It continued through the convention in Cleveland in June.",
        "A resolution to end the domestic trade in ivory has descended into acrimony at a major conservation summit, with a handful of countries, including Japan and South Africa, objecting to the proposed ban. A coalition of countries, including the US, France, Gabon, Kenya and Malawi, spoke in favor of an International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) motion that calls for every country to ban their internal trade of ivory. However, delegates from Japan, Namibia and South Africa argued that domestic ivory markets should be left open as long as they are regulated.",
        "Better Things opens with its protagonist, Sam Fox, texting at a shopping mall while her daughter wails by her side. A nearby woman looks on judgmentally. \u201cDo you want to buy her earrings?\u201d retorts the single mom. \u201c\u2019Cause that\u2019s why she\u2019s crying. \u2019Cause I won\u2019t buy her earrings. \u201d Thanks to TV shows such as this and films such as Bad Moms and Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby, a messier view of motherhood is having a moment in pop culture.",
        "Efforts are brewing in at least eight states to repeal abortion restrictions that appear to be unconstitutional after a major supreme court victory for abortion rights advocates. That is according to Planned Parenthood officials, who vowed on Thursday to support these efforts and any others that take advantage of Monday\u2019s monumental decision. Planned Parenthood made the announcement the same day that Donald Trump, the GOP\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, broke a puzzling silence on the ruling, known as Whole Woman\u2019s Health v Hellerstedt.",

        "As Hillary Clinton prepared for the first presidential debate against Donald Trump on Monday, campaign surrogates spoke in swing states and the New York Times published a strongly worded endorsement of the former secretary of state. The Times\u2019 editorial board said that as first lady, senator for New York and secretary of state, Clinton had shown herself to be \u201cone of the most tenacious politicians of her generation\u201d capable of fostering bipartisan cooperation.

        "Barack Obama\u2019s announcement that the United States proposes to admit 110, 000 refugees over the course of the next year has elicited a furious reaction from some Republican leaders. This was predictable. A spirit of xenophobia has once again taken hold in the United States, as has happened on several previous occasions in American history. As early as 1798, just a few years after the establishment of the Republic, Congress adopted a Naturalization law that was intended to keep out radicals who could promote sedition.",

        "What happens in an hour can make all the difference. When I had my first baby, the support I received from my nurse was indispensable in helping me initiate and continue breastfeeding. It may not be obvious, but putting newborns to the breast within the first hour of life can make the difference between life and death. Delaying the start of breastfeeding beyond one hour after birth can raise a newborns risk of dying by 80% compared to those who are breastfed immediately. Newborns now account for nearly half of all deaths of children under five.",

        "What have you accomplished this week? Whatever it is, you don\u2019t come close to Donald Trump. Trump has demolished his campaign, his brand and his party. He has squandered his pick and his convention, and several battleground states along with them. He picked several fights he could not win, and showed no sign of learning from his own failure. It would be tempting to say this was just another week in the bizarre life of the Republican presidential nominee. But it wasn\u2019t.",
        "Dave Mirra, the BMX icon who killed himself in February aged 41, had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the chronic brain disease that has been found in dozens of former NFL players, a University of Toronto doctor has concluded. Several other neuropathologists confirmed the diagnosis, according to ESPN. Mirra is the first BMX rider to be diagnosed with CTE, a disease tied to repeated brain trauma and associated with symptoms such as memory loss, depression and progressive dementia. Mirra was found dead in Greenville, South Carolina on 4 February from a gunshot wound.",
        "What does Gary Johnson know? After yet another easily avoidable televised blunder in which the Libertarian presidential candidate failed to name even one leader of a foreign country that he was fond of, it\u2019s a fair question. If, by some miracle, Johnson were able to cobble together enough support to reach the 15% threshold to qualify for the debates, that would be the only question I would want answered. Just two minutes of Johnson rattling off things he does know. How many eggs in a dozen? That\u2019s a snap, Anderson. It\u2019s 12. Where are babies made, Mr Johnson?",
        "Elon Musk\u2019s rockets usually do not stray beyond Earth\u2019s orbit, but that hasn\u2019t stopped him from making promises about Mars. The Tesla CEO\u2019s wild, ambitious futurism has earned him billions of dollars, fawning coverage from the tech press, and a subreddit devoted entirely to discussion of his divinity.",
        "Twitter has told potential acquirers it is seeking to conclude negotiations about a sale by the time it reports earnings on 27 October, according to people familiar with the matter. The timeline is hugely ambitious in the context of most mergers and acquisitions, given that Twitter began mulling a sale only last month. It is the clearest sign yet that CEO Jack Dorsey is pushing to provide clarity to shareholders and employees over the company\u2019s future as quickly as possible.",
        "When Elon Musk isn\u2019t outlining plans to use his massive rocket to leave a decaying Planet Earth and colonize Mars, he sometimes talks about his belief that Earth isn\u2019t even real and we probably live in a computer simulation. \u201cThere\u2019s a billion to one chance we\u2019re living in base reality,\u201d he said at a conference in June. Musk is just one of the people in Silicon Valley to take a keen interest in the \u201csimulation hypothesis\u201d which argues that what we experience as reality is actually a giant computer simulation created by a more sophisticated intelligence.",
        "The parties have spoken and after a brutal campaign season, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are now the official presidential candidates of the Republican and Democratic parties. Now the real fight begins, and the economy will be a key \u2014 if not the key \u2014 battleground. More than 90% of voters have said that the economy is extremely important to them. The Guardian asked three economists to weigh in on what we can expect from a Trump or Clinton White House.",
        "The good news according to the World Energy Council (WEC) is that, per person, our energy demand is set to peak before 2030. Of course, there will be more of us around by then too, so that total demand will only slow, rather than level out. A heady whiff of technological optimism accompanies the explanation that this will happen because of \u201cunprecedented efficiencies created by new technologies and more stringent energy policies\u201d."
