        "Gareth Southgate has had five games in charge for centuries and, though no one might have seriously expected him to notice all the team \u2019 s imperfections in that time, it simply cannot be satisfactory that it is so rare to see even the slightest flickers of improvement. They were poor again here in London and fortunate, in the extreme, that Southgate did not have to take on England \u2019 s first appearance in a qualifying fixture for five years.",
        "Reince Priebus hopes that the convention in Cleveland next week will help unify the GOP. \u201c Given the opportunity that we \u2019 ve had \u2026 I think now, more than ever, the presence of the convention to assist in the establishment of the party is going to be particularly important, \u201d the chairman of the Republican National Committee told Milwaukee Journal reported over the Fourth of July debate. Unfortunately for the chairman, the convention will showcase a Republican platform that is about as united as the former Democrats.",
        "Men who served as the primary breadwinners in their marriages are more likely to face psychological and social hurdles, according to a recent study that looks at a major adverse impact of changing gender roles. The study, released on Friday by University of Connecticut sociologists, found that as couples take on a greater level of economic responsibility in their relationships, they reported greater impact on their wellbeing and health. In years where men in question were their family \u2019 s main breadwinner, their psychological and health issues were at their worst.",
        "American Horror Story has been renewed for a second season set to center on the murder of fashion model Gianni Versace. According to Deadline, it will shoot simultaneously with the second season which will chronicle the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. The first season, which was centered on the trial of OJ Simpson, was a surprise hit and won five Emmys earlier this year. The anthology season was masterminded by Ryan Murphy, who previously created American Horror Story and Glee.",
        "After a century of shooing park hunters, tending to trails and letting visitors enjoy the freedom of the natural world, the guardians of America \u2019 s most treasured places have been handed an absolutely unimaginable new job \u2014 considering the assault climate change is waging against national parks throughout the nation. As the National Parks Service ( NPS ) has charted the extent of glaciers, sea levels rise and increase in wildfires prompted by rising temperatures in recent years, the scale of the threats to US heritage across the 412 national parks and reserves has become starkly apparent.",
        "Every day before the sun rises, Maria Ampofo, a single mother of four boys, frantically gathers her belongings and sets off for work to break the morning traffic in Ghana \u2019 s capital, Accra. If she doesn \u2019 t leave before daybreak, driving during rush hour could extend her journey from Accra \u2019 s suburbs towards downtown to three or four hours. \u201c I \u2019 m in trouble if I leave my house around 6 or 6. 30am, \u201d Ampofo says. \u201c I then won \u2019 t arrive at work until nine or 10am, and that creates a lot of problems with my manager because I \u2019 m bound to get there by eight.",
        "When Michelle Obama gets on the microphone, the audience listens. Her speech at the Democratic Conference in July was judged by CNN to be the best of the week, highlighting the emotional and inspirational heights that Bill Clinton \u2019 s presidential career has sometimes struggled to achieve. Her turn on Carpool Karaoke with James Corden this weekend, singing Beyonc\u00e9 and Stevie Wonder, has, at the time of airing, been watched nearly 44m long on YouTube. But for most of the eight months she has lived in the White House, there has been no microphone.",
        "South Korea \u2019 s archers routed the United States to win the men \u2019 s individual gold at the Rio Games on Saturday and restore a record broken by the Americans at Beijing four years old. The peerless trio of Kim Song and Lee roared to a climax on a baking hot day at the Sambodromo, clinching South Korea \u2019 s silver team title and gold in the last five years. \u201c I \u2019 ve been waiting for this moment, to claim gold, for four months, \u201d beaming world champion Korean, who fired a world champion during Friday \u2019 s ranking round, told reporters. \u201c We found each other, and it happened.",
        "Maybe you made the first presidential campaign of 2016. Maybe you \u2019 re an American liberal. And maybe, just maybe, you said one candidate was a very close winner by the end of it all. The only question you should now be asking yourself is \u201c how many other parties in the country agreed with me? \u201d I have one poll ( and a whole set of caveats ) for you. The poll suggests that the race was a huge success for Bill Clinton. The caveats suggest Democrats don \u2019 t have a reason to celebrate Obama.",
        "As the US Congress returned to Washington on Tuesday after a recess, lawmakers remained at an impasse over funding to fight the Zika virus even after the disease spread rapidly during the year across Puerto Rico and a host of states across the US. Democrats in the Republican Senate again blocked a bill that would provide $ 1. 1bn in grants to tackle Zika, objecting to language used by House Republicans that could target Planned Parenthood, undermine healthcare and maintain a ban on flying the white flag at veterans \u2019 facilities.",
        "Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Smith has highlighted the opposition to former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney becoming secretary of state. Romney has emerged as one of the frontrunners for the position, despite remarks he had made about Trump in the past. In a tweet earlier on Thursday, Johnson drew attention to what she described as a \u201c deluge of social media private comms re : Romney Some Trump loyalists turn against Romney as sec of state \u201d.",
        "Any day now, monarch butterflies will begin their winter migration from Canada to Canada. It is one of the wonders of the Caribbean : insects whose large orange and black tails barely stretch several inches flying on cold currents up to 3, 000 miles in search of a warm spot to survive the winter. The phenomenon has entranced Manuel L\u00f3pez Rivera since his childhood days in rural Puerto Rico.",
        "In the final scene of Kanye West \u2019 s video for his 2008 release Love Lockdown the rapper gets up into a foetal position in the middle of a stark white room, his hands clutched desperately in his lap. It is a moment of vulnerability one might see as being at odds with the antagonistic, megastar, who declares himself a god, has stolen awards from the hands of Taylor Swift and makes violent outbursts on television chat shows.",
        "The head of the Centers for Disease Control, congressional Democrats and the at the Department of Homeland Security called for Republicans to bring a Zika funding bill to the floor \u2014 again. The call comes two weeks after a measure passed the House around 3am, loaded with unrelated provisions Democrats called \u201cpoison pills\u201d and after the Senate attempted to advance a $1. 1bn bill. \u201cWe\u2019ve got one week left,\u201d said Kathy Castor, a Democratic representative for the Tampa Bay area, along Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast. The locality is at high risk for transmission of the disease.",
        "More than 120 police officers were injured and 86 demonstrators detained during riots in Berlin, which police have described as \u201cthe most aggressive and violent protests in the last five years\u201d. Berlin police said in a statement on Sunday that protesters threw bottles, cobblestones and fireworks, destroyed cars and attacked officers, one of whom required hospital treatment. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how many rioters were injured. About 3, 500 protesters participated in the rallies, which started on Saturday evening and lasted until early on Sunday.",
        "Buddy Ryan, the pugnacious coach who masterminded two fierce defenses that won Super Bowl titles and whose twin sons are NFL coaches, died Tuesday. He was 82. His death was confirmed by the Buffalo Bills, who are coached by Rex Ryan. James Solano, Buddy Ryan\u2019s agent, said he died in Kentucky but did not give a cause. Ryan lived on a ranch in Shelbyville. \u201cBuddy was a legend in our league in so many ways,\u201d the Bills said in a statement.",
        "Lee Daniels has criticised the #OscarsSoWhite controversy, saying that people need to \u201cstop complaining\u201d. Daniels, whose film Precious made him only the second black director to have ever been nominated for an Oscar, has spoken about his frustration with those who claim the past two years of nominees is a clear sign of industry racism. \u201cGo out and do the work,\u201d he said to the New York Times. \u201cOscars so white! So what? Do your work. Let your legacy speak and stop complaining, man.",
        "Nikki Hayden, 26, psychology student, London, Until I was about four or five I didn\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t a girl, to be honest with you. One of my earliest memories, about five years old, was being yelled at by a teacher for going to the toilet with the girls. About the same age I realised I was different to these other boys. At the age of nine I refused to have my hair cut. I didn\u2019t have it cut until I was 16, because having it cut was such a torment to me. School was extremely difficult.",
        "Jurors have awarded a University of Virginia administrator $3m for her portrayal in a Rolling Stone magazine article about the school\u2019s handling of a brutal gang rape a fraternity house. The jury\u2019s decision came after they concluded on Friday that the magazine, its publisher and reporter Sabrina Rubin Erdely were responsible for defamation, with actual malice, of former associate dean of students Nicole Eramo in the 2014 story A Rape on Campus. Eramo sued the magazine for $7.",
        "Talk about fresh. Seth Rogen\u2019s naughty food cartoon Sausage Party is, like much of his best work, deceptive packaging. The script he and his usual collaborator Evan Goldberg have written (in conjunction with Kyle Hunter and Ariel Shaffir) seems, at first, to trade solely on anthropomorphised food using profanity on supermarket shelves. This is mildly amusing at first but, like a bun out of its Cellophane, threatens to go stale. That\u2019s when a jar of honey mustard gets returned. The supermarket is what Erving Goffman might call a total institution.",
        "Slavery is a footnote in the history of many universities in the United States. Mostly, that\u2019s where it stays. But not for Georgetown, which sold 272 slaves in 1838. The university wants to come to terms with its past and take the abstract concepts of reconciliation and redemption and make them tangible. Will they succeed? In their announcement, I heard the buzzwords \u201cdiversity\u201d and \u201cinclusion\u201d several times, and those trend words put me on edge. Organizations use those terms all the time and little comes from the effort to make elitist and exclusionary circles more accessible.",
        "A Chicago man was shot and killed while live streaming a video on Facebook, police said on Friday, just days after a double homicide in France in which the killer later took to Facebook Live to encourage more violence. Antonio Perkins, 28, was found face down on Wednesday night in a vacant lot with gunshot wounds to the neck and head on the city\u2019s west side, Chicago police officer Laura Amezaga said. Perkins was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead.",
        "When Nate Parker \u201carrived\u201d with the screening of his film The Birth of a Nation at the Sundance festival in January, the timing couldn\u2019t have been more urgent. Ten days before its unveiling, #OscarsSoWhite had begun to trend again on Twitter. For the second year in a row, no actors of colour were nominated for an Academy Award. Here was an picture from a African American film\u2011maker, featuring a mostly black cast, and centring on Nat Turner, a former slave who led a brutally violent revolt in 1831 to free slaves in Virginia.",
        "Democratic party outrage at the FBI\u2019s shock revelation, almost on the eve of the US presidential election, that it is resuming its controversial investigation of Hillary Clinton after declaring in July that the matter was closed, has been fierce. Donna Brazile, chairwoman of the Democratic national committee, was one of many to cry foul. \u201cThe FBI has a solemn obligation to remain neutral in political matters. Even the faintest appearance of using the agency\u2019s power to influence our election is deeply troubling,\u201d she said.",
        "Gianfranco Rosi\u2019s beautiful, mysterious and moving film is a documentary that looks like a neorealist classic. It is a portrait of Lampedusa, the Sicilian island where desperate migrants from Africa and the Middle East arrive each year hoping for a new life in Europe: 400, 000 in the last 20 years. Around its coast thousands are drowned, or dragged dead from their grotesquely unsafe inflatables, burned or poisoned by fumes from the diesel with which their craft have had to be refuelled from jerry cans in choppy seas.",
        "Samantha Bee and Glenn Beck sat down to discuss the Trump tenure, with the former rightwing Fox host admitting he had made mistakes and that he didn\u2019t want to do any more damage.

        "On the 2016 campaign trail, Donald Trump has insisted that he is worth more than $10bn. However, a statement filed to the Securities and Exchange Commission by Wells Fargo Securities on Trump\u2019s behalf in 2012 indicated that the real estate developer was then worth less than half that, with comparatively few of the liquid assets that may now finance his campaign for president. In the document, which concerned the securitization of commercial mortgages on properties including Trump Tower in New York City, Trump was described as being worth more than $4. 2bn, with liquid assets of more than $250m.",

        "Toronto\u2019s second is back behind bars, after an five weeks on the run from a Toronto park, munching grass and lolling around in ponds. The capybara\u2019s brief taste of freedom came to an end on Tuesday, after the rodent \u2014 native to South America and resembling a large, tailless beaver with stumpy legs \u2014 was lured into a cage near a pond in the park in the city. \u201cIt\u2019s baaaack!\u201d Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation announced on Facebook.

        "Researchers said they believe they have located the wreckage of the Endeavour, a ship sailed by the famous British explorer James Cook, which was sunk off the US during the revolutionary war. The ship was scuttled in 1778 leading up to the Battle of Rhode Island between American colonists and the British, and was as part of a blockade during the revolutionary war. It now appears to have been located by the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project (RIMAP) at one of nine sites containing 13 ships."
