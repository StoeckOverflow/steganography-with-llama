The warnings call for the possibility of waves of up to 3m ( 10 feet ) along the country \u2019 s east coast, but the highest tsunami wave, of 1. 4m ( 4. 6 feet ) was heard at Sendai port shortly after 8am.",
        "What has been seen, the saying goes, cannot be denied, and for Indecline, a \u201c anarchist art form \u201d that was surely the point : on Thursday, the group installed plaster effigies of Donald Trump, the US presidential candidate, in five cities across the nation that left nothing to the public. If you have none yourself, the title keeps you out. The Emperor Has No Balls, the group gleefully dubbed it, duplicates of the naked Trump in New York, San Francisco, Cleveland, Seattle and Los Angeles.",

The Trump campaign announced the loans cost more than $ 50m, although the Federal Trade Commission ( FEC ) only lists $ 45, 703, 185 donated by the candidate to the campaign.

MMAjunkie first spread the news on Wendesday night announcing that Silva might leave the world \u2019 s leading mixed martial arts coach by the end of the year.

Fansided, a global social news publication, dates Trump \u2019 s funeral at 1 August while the Daily Telegraph called it for 21 March. Forbes found no fewer than \u201c 13 previous times \u201d that Oliver had attacked the real estate tycoon. Critics of the news might conclude that it is impossible to, as the dictionary indicates, \u201c put an end to the possibility of something \u201d more than a single man.",
        "The lawsuit brought by the wife of Donald Trump against the Daily Mail is a warning to the media from her husband \u201c to get away from my family, particularly Melania \u201d his biographer has said. Lawyers for Melania resigned on Thursday filed suit for $ 150m in damages against the newspaper in Texas state court.

Thomas Heatherwick \u2019 s vision of a giant, collection of staircases that will feed the public fresh views of the city was unveiled in New York on Wednesday and is currently under construction in Italy.

The planet reached the end of its operational life earlier this month and was due to splashdown \u2014 eventually \u2014 in the Atlantic Ocean. But at a recent news conference, the Chinese space agency admitted it had lost contact with the station. They did not understand what had gone wrong. Does losing contact matter?

        "Donald Trump \u2019 s campaign doubled its budget in July, even though the Republican nominee still only employed about 80 people, using no television ads and broke ties with his fired campaign manager and the writer who plagiarized several of his wife \u2019 s convention calls. His campaign lags far behind that of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, whose campaign spent about twice as far as his did last month. Obama also raised more funds, taking in $ 52m for her campaign and spending, according to July filings with the Federal Election Commission, while Trump raised $ 37m for his campaign and home.",
        "If rappers are the new pop stars perhaps it \u2019 s because so many of them seem to be cognizant of the old one. On Tuesday, Danny Brown, one of rap \u2019 s most iconic voices, released his first album, Atrocity Exhibition, titled after a Joy Division song ( itself named after the book by JG Ballard ).

        "I\u2019m extremely . I believe cucumbers are demonic, the black hole of the food world, infusing everything close by with their evil . I didn\u2019t actually try cucumber until 18 and I avoided them since. Which became more difficult after going vegetarian and even more difficult after going vegan. My first memories are of being with food. I couldn\u2019t stand cabbage, onions, courgettes especially. Dad would be starving for Irish stew after laying pipes all day, so it was all about him getting his food.",
        "The Fourth of July used to be one of my favorite holidays, but the significance of the day has changed since the halcyon days of slip\u2019n\u2019slides and flat soda pop. When I was a kid, it was all fireworks and good cheer, plus the kind of pure, unadulterated patriotism that only the young \u2014 and blissfully unaware of our country\u2019s international foreign policy \u2014 can tap into. As an irresponsible I made the Fourth a bit of a bacchanal of cheap hot dogs, lukewarm beer, and far more illicit fireworks purchased from Mexico.",
        "To say that David Bowie\u2019s final album was coloured by his death two days after its release, and the revelation that he recorded it beneath the terminal shadow of cancer, would be an understatement. It was flooded by it. Few albums have ever been subjected to so much exegesis so quickly. Was the central image, coming from the author of Starman and multiple ruminations on stardom, an act of ?",

The lawsuit against Gawker was funded by Silicon Valley billionaire and Donald Trump donor Peter Thiel.",
        "The road out of Kommunizm, a small town in southern Tajikistan, is badly paved and bumpy. Like most things here it was built long ago, when the ruling ideology that gave the settlement its name was still thriving. Home to just 7, 000 inhabitants, Kommunizm was at the very edge of the Russian empire, first tsarist then Soviet a mere 50 miles from Kunduz in northern Afghanistan. All around the former collective farm is the once splendid iconography of the Bolshevik order.",
        "It always surprises me how different most people\u2019s approach to wine is from their approach to food. While we have an apparently insatiable appetite for new ingredients and recipes, there seems to be much less curiosity around booze. If I were talking to you about how to become a better cook in 2017, I\u2019d suggest making a commitment to try at least one new recipe a month, so why not make it a goal regularly to try a drink you haven\u2019t had before?",
        "When I was a child, growing up on a council estate in the northeast of England, I imbibed enough of the background racial tensions of the late 1970s and 1980s to feel profoundly unwelcome in Britain. My right, not just to regard myself as a British citizen, but even to be in Britain, seemed contested. Despite our mother\u2019s careful protection, the tenor of our times seeped through the concrete walls into our home and into my mind and into my siblings\u2019 minds.",
        "In July, we asked readers to each tell us about their Defining Moment, with one person being selected to appear on our final podcast.

        "If current projections hold, Hillary Clinton will soon become the second presidential nominee to win the popular vote yet lose the electoral college \u2014 and thus the White House \u2014 in the past five US presidential elections. Clinton, who gave a speech on Wednesday conceding to her victorious Republican opponent Donald Trump, is poised to lose the electoral college tally by a decisive 74 votes (nearly 14% of the total available) while carrying a slim majority of the overall votes cast.

        "Reducing a European Championship to a clash between two individuals seems somehow simplistic yet this tactical battle essentially revolved around how Wales and Portugal used Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo. Bale was regularly involved in play but Ronaldo proved decisive. On a wider level this was a clash between two teams playing without a traditional and instead using two natural wingers up front. Hal and Nani are more accustomed to wide positions but have been outstanding as strike partners for Bale and Ronaldo respectively.",
        "Two former Wells Fargo employees have filed a class action in California seeking $2. 6bn or more for workers who tried to meet aggressive sales quotas without engaging in fraud and were later demoted, forced to resign or fired.

        "Federica and Isabel\u2019s love story was not that unusual, apart from one detail. The affair, which culminated in a civil union this week in the Italian town of Pinerolo, began \u201cslowly\u201d according to their friend, Franco Barbero. The two had a lot in common, having both decided to devote their lives to charitable work. They fell in love working at a rehabilitation centre for drug addicts, but there was just one hitch.
