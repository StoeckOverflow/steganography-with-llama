        "Senior authorities within amateur wrestling have warned many events, including those to decide boxers, could be fixed at the World Games in Rio de Janeiro amid growing concern about corruption and possible malpractice at the sport \u2019 s global governing body, the Guardian can read. Horrified senior officials within the sport believe a cabal of judges are able to use their knowledge to manipulate the draw and the voting system to ensure individual boxers will win. One senior figure claims there was \u201c no doubt \u201d some of the judges and referees in Rio \u201c will be corrupted \u201d.",
        "A Swedish court has accused the Mail newspaper of falsely representing her as the victim of a sexual assault in an article about sex attacks allegedly perpetrated by \u201c foreign youths \u201d at a gay festival. Lisen Andr\u00e9asson Florman told the media she was shocked to discover herself treated as the victim of an assault, and said she felt \u201c violated \u201d by the Mail Online report. The article had contained extensive passages from Andr\u00e9asson Florman describing a sexual assault at the hands of a group of teenagers, who groped her breasts and left her feeling \u201c small and vulnerable \u201d.",
        "Stefan Kuntz took the moment well. He said the Euro 96 between England and Germany at Wembley was the highlight of his life. The anniversary of the game was on sale, and it \u2019 s fair to say the repercussions of the game have been for England than for Germany. The match had finished and it went to a penalty shootout. Kuntz had asked the referee, Berti Vogts, to put him fifth in the middle of for one specific goal : he was hoping that the shootout would be over by the time it came round to him.",
        "After NBC \u2019 s cancellation of the Olympic closing ceremony from Rio, viewers were subject to an additional heaping helping of wild numbers and awkward moments thanks to a preview of the new season of the talent hunt stalwart with those revolving chairs aka The House. Revamped for an American television network, the latest iteration features original judges Adam Levine and Blake Shelton, along with newcomers Miley Cyrus and Alicia Fox. Here are five takeaways of what we \u2019 re in store for this special season.",
        "\u201c It \u2019 s particularly the backhand method, \u201d says Craig O \u2019 Shannessy, the TV analyst for Wimbledon, the US Open and the ATP and WTA Tours. \u201c It \u2019 s the best backhand tournament in the world. That \u2019 s where it all starts. Most attacks are directed to the backhand. It \u2019 s just really the end of his technique. Two feet on the grip, his upper arm rotates 90 degrees sideways and that \u2019 s it. O \u2019 Shannessy found out that Novak Djokovic rarely shoots for broke on the return. \u201c The average target area is usually right down the middle of the ball.",
        "Ava DuVernay, producer of the Martin Luther King drama Selma, has made a somewhat radical documentary for children in sympathy with the Black Lives Matter movement. Her film argues that America \u2019 s incarceration of free men is a phenomenon with its beginnings in slavery, and that the resemblances are not minor or permanent echoes but symptoms of the same underlying cause.",
        "The actor and actress Zsa Zsa Gabor has died aged 99. The former star, arguably more responsible for her larger than life stature and string of marriages than for her life, passed away at her apartment in Los Angeles on Christmas. Her husband, Frederic William Anhalt, said she died of a heart attack. \u201c We tried hard, but her heart just stopped and that was it, \u201d he says. \u201c Even the ambulance tried very hard to get her home, but there was no way.",
        "All in all 2016 hasn \u2019 t been a great day for women \u2019 s rights. The brief flicker of hope that we would finally have a female leader in the US was thoroughly doused by Donald Trump. Last year two women won a Nobel prize this year there was one. The number of female CEOs in the Fortune 500 dropped. And research conducted at the World Economic Forum found that it will take almost 170 years to close the huge pay gap around the world. One hundred and seventy years.",
        "I was having a discussion with one of my children \u2014 I won \u2019 t say which part, but let \u2019 s just say she is very much a part of the virtual worlds \u2014 those who get most of their entertainment and knowledge from the internet. The subject extended to, well, possibly global warming, ecology or environmental pollution. The point was, my mom had some facts. Or thought she had some history. The gist was that these facts, which she \u2019 d picked up online, were not only enormous and significant, but were being covered by the mainstream media.",
        "Among the major figures who congratulated Donald Trump on his surprise election win was the politician to whom the billionaire real estate mogul and reality TV star has most often been compared : Silvio Berlusconi. The rightwing former Italian finance minister and billionaire media mogul, who was dogged by claims that he used an underage teenager at his infamous \u201c bunga bunga \u201d parties and described Vladimir Putin as a longtime ally and friend, felt the comparisons between the two were \u201c obvious \u201d and that Trump would deal with \u201c authority and equilibrium \u201d.",
        "Barbara Gibb, the last of the three Gibb brothers who fronted pop band the Bee Gees, has died at the age of 95. Barbara, who was born and raised in England, died of natural causes on Friday evening at her residence in Miami, where she had lived for the preceding 20 years, according to a publicist for her youngest son, Barry Gibb. Her son, Barry, and daughter, Susan, survive her.",
        "Tiger Woods, beset by injuries and the decline of his playing career, appears to have at least one person who genuinely believes in him. And that person is Tiger Woods. In an interview with Ken Rose on PBS on Sunday night, the former American No1 said he is targeting an imminent return to golf as well as more victories in the majors. Woods has not played competitively since March 2015 after three separate shots on his back, and pulled out of a late return earlier this season after describing his game as \u201c vulnerable \u201d.",
        "Ratings for the Emmys have fallen to an eight, with this year \u2019 s ceremony averaging just 11. 3 million viewers. The show, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel for CBS, fell 5 % from last week \u2019 s broadcast and 22 % in the key category of adults aged. There was less competition from Sunday Night Football on NBC and a guest performance by the first episode of the CBS documentary The Best Of : JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey, as well as CBS coverage of the New York and New Jersey games. In previous years, ratings have been boosted by NFL.",
        "Before long, Santiago could be a city full of electric vehicles charged by \u201csmart\u201d power grids, many of them driving on highways equipped with automated variable toll pricing. Perhaps a new arrival to the Chilean capital would go for the chance to found a technology company, incentivised by programmes like the Chile, in \u201cChilecon Valley\u201d. And perhaps they\u2019ll stay for the capital\u2019s reputation boasting the most advanced public transit system in Latin America. Or they might opt for Africa instead of South America, to take advantage of the assistance offered by organisations like SmartXchange in Durban.",
        "As this game Paul Pogba\u2019s \u201csecond coming\u201d at Manchester United stood at 10 appearances, one goal, and no display. There had been flashes of quality but little else to suggest the world\u2019s most expensive footballer was living up to the billing. Nearly two months to the day since his first appearance of the season \u2014 a promising turn in the win over Southampton \u2014 here was a perfect opponent to deliver against. To be a defining factor for United against Liverpool at Anfield is precisely the kind of performance for which \u00a393.",

The lakes are trapped by sandy mounds, left behind after the Caspian Sea\u2019s level rose then fell in the wake of the last ice age.

        "Star Trek Beyond landed atop the weekend US box office, soaring to $59. 6m in North American ticket sales and knocking Universal\u2019s The Secret Life of Pets from the No1 spot, according to studio estimates on Sunday. Pets was the film at theaters, adding $29. 3m to its stellar $260m earnings to date. Paramount\u2019s Star Trek Beyond is the third film since JJ Abrams rebooted the franchise in 2009. Despite the latest release opening $20m behind 2009\u2019s Star Trek, experts say it\u2019s still promising.",
        "North Dakota police have issued an arrest warrant for the Democracy Now! host Amy Goodman, who has been reporting on the Native American protests against an oil pipeline, accusing her of entering \u201cprivate property\u201d to conduct interviews. The charges have raised concerns about possible free speech violations and press intimidation, since the Morton county sheriff\u2019s office accused the broadcast journalist after Democracy Now! filmed security guards working for the Dakota access pipeline using dogs and pepper spray on protesters.",
        "The European commission president, Juncker, has clashed bitterly with Nigel Farage, pointedly asking the Ukip leader in front of the European parliament in Brussels: \u201cWhy are you still here?\u201d In extraordinary scenes, Juncker said on Tuesday that he respected British democracy and last Thursday\u2019s seismic vote for the UK to leave the European Union. There was a smattering of applause in the chamber. The former Luxembourg prime minister then broke off from his speech in French and addressed Farage, sitting to his immediate right, in English. \u201cThat\u2019s the last time you are applauding here.",
        "I first met Alan when I started running the Royal Court in the late 1990s. Despite how incredibly busy he was, he offered himself to me as a kind of generous lieutenant, ready to fight on behalf of the theatre, or sought to give focused and insightful encouragement. You need people like that. When I became aware that he actually played this role for multitudes of people it didn\u2019t diminish how lucky I felt.",
        "Nani could not understand it. His mind was scrambled and the situation would affect him physically. The Portugal winger had been given a new contract at Manchester United in September 2013 by the manager, David Moyes, and, having joined from Sporting Lisbon in 2007, he felt wanted and ready to fire himself to higher levels. Then Moyes did not play him. Or at least he hardly did so. In Nani would start only seven Premier League games. \u201cIt could have been the best moment of my life but it turned into the worst,\u201d Nani says.",
        "Mexico was the focus of the global lens last week thanks to an unexpected and dreadful event: the visit of the most rude and unapologetic US presidential candidate in political history. Why did Donald Trump come here? It was the question that millions of Mexicans kept asking ourselves while saying, \u201cYou\u2019re not welcome!\u201d The Republican presidential candidate arrived in my country offering diplomacy as fake as a $3 bill. He knows that he\u2019s not welcome and was aware of his rejection, by not just Mexico but all of Latin America, and the other countries and cultures he has offended.",
        "As a network, USA has traditionally been the home of \u201cblue sky\u201d procedurals where there\u2019s no problem that can\u2019t be overcome in the span of 60 minutes. That\u2019s why Mr Robot was a shock last summer. The gritty story of a hacker with a drug problem and mental health issues trying to take down capitalism by forgiving the world\u2019s debt didn\u2019t really make sense alongside the likes of the relatively Royal Pains and Burn Notice.",
        "Oscar Pistorius, the South African Paralympic and Olympic athlete, removed the prostheses he uses for walking and running in court on Wednesday in an effort to avoid a heavy jail sentence for killing his girlfriend with four shots from a 9mm handgun fired through a closed toilet door. Pistorius, whose lower legs were amputated when he was 11 months old, removed his prostheses and made his way unsteadily across the courtroom.",
        "Authorities are investigating the death of an architect who fell after apparently becoming dizzy while working on the roof of a New York skyscraper. Bruno Travalja, 52, of Ridgewood, New Jersey, died on Thursday afternoon after falling from the roof of the building in Manhattan, police said on Saturday. Travalja took off a harness and knelt down to take some measurements, then became dizzy and fell, they said. The New York Daily News, which reached his wife, reported that he was the owner of Crowne Architectural Systems in North Bergen, New Jersey.",
        "NFL kickers missed like never before on Sunday, setting a record with 11 failed extra point attempts. Kickers missed left, right, had kicks blocked and hit the uprights. Kickers missed in the wind and indoors. With several games left, kickers already had the most misses in one week since the NFL merger. The NFL moved attempts back before last season because the kicks had become routine, and professionals almost never missed. The attempt became a . In Week 13 of last season, kickers missed eight. That mark was eclipsed by Sunday.",
        "If MLS was ever looking for a prospective new signing to herald as their very own LeBron James, trailing his decision over which team he will be taking his talents to next, they might have found one in Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The striker last week confirmed his exit from Paris and clubs in England, Italy and China are presenting their cases to the Swede. But reports suggest he is instead on his way to North America. Ibrahimovic could milk this even more than James ever did.",
        "The sky above was dark with smoke. At the railway station, as Ntsiki Makhubo and her mother returned from a day in Johannesburg, they were met by an anxious crowd. As they stepped down from the train, they trod on shattered glass and heard the news. Your brother has been shot and killed, Makhubo was told. When South African police opened fire on marching schoolchildren in the township of Soweto on 16 June 1976, Makhubo\u2019s neighbours had seen her older brother, Mbuyisa Makhubo, drenched in blood and staggering to a clinic, carrying a limp boy in his arms.",
        "In January, I wrote: \u201cIn the first 26 days of this year, 186 political polls were released. \u201d Since then, I\u2019ve lost count. New numbers are released every day by different organizations (some academic, some corporate and some media businesses themselves) and they all depict a slightly different political reality. To state the obvious, in 2016 political reality is very different from that of previous presidential elections. And not just because the two remaining candidates are the least popular for more than 30 years.",
        "Donald Trump has done the impossible: he has made Mike Pence interesting. The governor of Indiana, a social conservative, looks like a politician from central casting, a Hoosier who might sit silently behind any president through any State of the Union speech. In recent weeks, as the Trump veepstakes dragged on, he stayed relentlessly scripted, perpetually . Next to the other finalists, the former House speaker Newt Gingrich and the New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, he lacked star power. He lacked pizzazz."
