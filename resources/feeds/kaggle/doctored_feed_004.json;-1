        "American rapper William Tyler \u2019 s stunning fourth album ends with an anxiety attack and opens with an interpolation of Dire Straits \u2019 Sultans of Swing so strong, I \u2019 m still not sure it \u2019 s there. The next album strung between those opposite poles is of such eloquence it renders them superfluous. Context almost gets in the way. Modern Dance is a beatific and expansive ambient record daubed in bass and electric guitars, rhythmic oscillations, some really scary lyrics and no words its meaning can be explained.",
        "Sitting in the luxurious and ornately gilded lounge of a Rome Hotel, Carolyn Tamras perches on the edge of a black velvet sofa. For many days last summer, says Carolyn, she sits \u201c like this \u201d leaning back and wrapping her arms around her knees, head lowered, gently rocking. \u201c Then I guess, I am no use to my family like this. This is my challenge. \u201d It is her husband Peter \u2019 s 49th birthday and the couple can scarcely believe that he has just been wished many happy returns by King Francis in a private meeting.",
        "When news arrived yesterday that Phil Collins was returning to live television, some Guardian commenters reacted with extreme horror. \u201c As if we haven \u2019 t suffered worse this year, \u201d wrote a miffed chrisf242. Lbonifacio Collins pulled no punches : \u201c I guess it could not get worse. \u201d Other commenters were more positive, but it \u2019 s clear that Phil \u2019 s return will be met in certain musical quarters since the election of Donald Trump. You see, it \u2019 s hard to remember a time when Collins wasn \u2019 t a target of revulsion to a certain kind of pop fan.",
        "On the plains of Nebraska, the abbreviation \u201c GBR \u201d means a simple thing to supporters of the University of Nebraska football teams. The Cornhuskers, so named in honor of the Nebraska state \u2019 s agricultural pioneer, have won five collegiate league titles and 880 games since being founded in 1890, the of any university in the United States. They \u2019 re a big influence in the land of cows, livestock and college football.",
        "It \u2019 s been a particularly horrifying issue for minority groups in Florida. The increasingly documented inhumanity towards African American people by police and the brutal acts of homophobia that took mostly human lives at a gay community in Orlando have awakened many to the bleak knowledge that growth is stalling and instead, regressive views on sex and sexuality are still quite pervasive.",
        "Radiant in white, Hillary Clinton greeted the cheering crowds at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, most of whom had waited hours in the wilting afternoon heat to see decisions made. Inside what appeared to be a giant greenhouse, families held up their daughters to catch a glimpse of the stage where, they fervently believed, stood the first Black woman to be elected President. There were plenty of women who had worked as volunteers in Clinton \u2019 s unsuccessful 2008 presidential campaign, offering sweet vindication. \u201c I \u2019 ve waited my whole life for this, \u201d one reminds me. \u201c I wouldn \u2019 t have missed it for the world.",
        "Jon Jones has been stripped of the UFC heavyweight light heavyweight Championship after an arbitration panel rejected his appeal of a positive result and upheld a doping ban that will continue through July. Widely considered the sport \u2019 s best fighter, Jones was pulled from a July rematch against Daniel Cormier at UFC 200 shortly after news about the positive drug test. Jones claims to have taken a pill but ended up testing positive for two banned agents.",
        "A Dominican citizen who says she was wrongly classified as a woman and held with male consent for 10 hours in a Miami motel has filed a US citizenship lawsuit alleging negligence and civil rights violations. The complaint comes three weeks after Fiordaliza Pichardo was arrested at Miami \u2019 s International airport on what attorneys claimed was a drug trafficking charges that was later dismissed. The $ 5m suit names the corrections department as a victim.",
        "Walmart intentionally neglected to pay hundreds of cab drivers in California the lowest wage, a federal jury decided on Wednesday, awarding the drivers $ 54m in damages and setting up the retail giant to creditors. The seven jurors returned the case in a lawsuit accusing the company of not properly paying employees in accordance with California laws for activities that included inspecting and driving their trucks and for layovers. Civil damages will be determined by a judge. The defendants argued that the drivers were paying for activities that include those activities and that they were not working during layovers.",
        "Stop the song. Hold the front desk. An girl likes to win! If this doesn \u2019 t sound particularly newsworthy, it \u2019 s because it isn \u2019 t. Or, at least, it shouldn \u2019 t be. But when you are a young black teen and your father is the president of the United States, all the usual ideas about privacy, respect and proper common sense quickly disappear. So Malia Obama, who has demonstrated extraordinary grace while showing up in the media spotlight, gets herself plastered across the nation for the cardinal sin of standing at a concert.",
        "Chris Jones has quit Top Gear after just one series in place of the BBC2 motoring show amid low ratings, unrelenting newspaper coverage and a breakdown of his relationship with Jean LeBlanc. The BBC is understood to be pleased with former Friends star LeBlanc \u2014 thought to be keen to go on the show \u2014 for a second stint. Last month, it was confirmed LeBlanc threatened to quit if Evans did not go. The BBC confirmed that it had \u201c no plans to replace Chris \u201d and that it did not expect to make any difference to the presenting.",
        "The International Paralympic Committee faces an international backlash from groups and athletes after it chose not to impose a blanket ban on the Russian team participating in next \u2019 s month \u2019 s Summer Games. Instead it decided the 28 individual sports federations which made up the summer Olympics were invited to decide the fate of Russia on a basis. Dick Cheney, the former World Swimming president who authored a damning report into doping in Russia last year, claimed the IOC \u2019 s decision had meant there \u201c was zero tolerance for doping, since it \u2019 s Russia \u201d. \u201c The IOC had a huge desire to make a statement.",
        "Pride and Prejudice and Zombies author Seth is being sued by his publisher for delivering a manuscript that Hachette claims is \u201can appropriation of a work\u201d. who unleashed the zombie mashup on the world with the surprise 2009 hit Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, and went on to write the bestseller Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, is being taken to court by Hachette for breach of contract.",
        "Amount of debt: $85, 000, Source of debt: College, Estimated time till debt free: Decades, Debt wasn\u2019t something I could talk to my boyfriend about. In fact, there were many topics that were too dangerous to broach \u2014 that was just one of them. The red flags had been popping up all over the place. A healthy person doesn\u2019t snap at someone for chewing too loudly or too fast. Getting your hand slapped for trying to show a funny YouTube clip isn\u2019t normal. And being in debt shouldn\u2019t result in bruises. But it did.",
        "In its history, few National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) conventions have arrived at as charged a moment as this. After police killings of black men in Baton Rouge and Minneapolis and two targeted killings of police officers, the US is being forced to stare down its perennial struggles with race and justice.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s visit to a black church in Detroit met with disgust among protesters and activists on Saturday, but won praise from parishioners who attended the service at the Great Faith Ministries church on the city\u2019s west side. A sea of protesters and a heavy police presence surrounded the church, as local residents along Grand River Avenue looked on. Chants of \u201cNo Trump, go home Trump\u201d were raised by about 75 people in a march organized by local pastors and activists.",
        "North Korean space officials say they are hard at work on a plan to launch more advanced satellites into orbit by 2020. But they don\u2019t intend to stop there: they\u2019re also apparently aiming to plant a flag on the moon. A senior official at North Korea\u2019s version of Nasa said that he hopes to see the DPRK\u2019s flag in space \u201cwithin 10 years\u201d. \u201cEven though the US and its allies try to block our space development, our aerospace scientists will conquer space,\u201d said Hyon director of the scientific research department of North Korea\u2019s National Aerospace Development Administration.",
        "Archaeologists working in southern France have identified three graves that are believed to represent the oldest Muslim burials ever found in Europe, dating to the eighth century. The skeletons at medieval site at N\u00eemes were found facing Mecca, and a genetic analysis showed their paternal lineage was North African, said the study in the journal Plos One. Furthermore, radiocarbon dating shows the bones likely date from the seventh to ninth centuries, suggesting they came from the Muslim conquests of Europe during that period.",
        "Donald Trump landed in Scotland on Friday in a typically confused state of mind. Not because he was promoting his private business instead of, you know, running for president. But because \u2014 God bless him \u2014 he couldn\u2019t figure out what just happened. It turns out that foreign affairs can be even more complicated than running a golf course. \u201cJust arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThey took their country back, just like we will take America back.",
        "About 960 members of the Canadian military reported being victims of sexual assault in the past year, and 27% of women in the armed forces have been sexually assaulted during their career, according to the country\u2019s national statistics agency. The landmark survey, commissioned by the military, found 1. 7% of regular force members of the military had been sexually assaulted in the past 12 months, nearly double the 0. 9% rate of sexual assault among working Canadians.",
        "Britain\u2019s sharp rise up the league table for global competitiveness to its highest place in a decade risks being reversed by the vote for Brexit, according to the World Economic Forum. The body that runs the annual Davos event said Britain had risen three places in the past year to rank seventh, but said the analysis for its Global Competitiveness report had used data collected before the 23 June referendum.",
        "South Korean Pok\u00e9mon Go players have been forced to leave their home towns and flock to a remote city close to the North Korean border in order to play because of the country\u2019s mapping restrictions. As a game augmented reality game, Pok\u00e9mon Go relies on data from Google Maps to function, but South Korean security restrictions on mapping data have blocked Google from providing map features across a significant proportion of the country, including realtime information, 3D maps, personal transport directions and indoor maps.",
        "Is the Republican party trying to ditch Donald Trump? With each of his outbursts, more Republicans fall off the Trump bandwagon. But this wouldn\u2019t be the first time a major party has repudiated its top figurehead. In fact, warfare is as old as America itself. When George Washington stepped down after two terms as America\u2019s first president, the country elected John Adams to succeed him.",
        "Ira Sachs\u2019 dramas are so understated in their ambition, they\u2019re easy to take for granted. Love is Strange, his 2014 film about a married gay couple\u2019s lives capsizing after they\u2019re forced to move out of their New York apartment, argued for marriage equality with stealth and power. His latest film, Little Men, uses a story about two young boys whose friendship is threatened by their warring parents to offer a piercing examination of gentrification in America. Sachs\u2019 approach is so humane, and his characters so fully rendered, that an agenda never announces itself instead, Sachs\u2019 worldview seeps into you.",
        "A northern Michigan police officer has been suspended with pay after he was seen driving a pickup truck bearing a Confederate flag around a group protesting against the election of Donald Trump as president. There have been numerous reports of threats, intimidation and racially charged violence around the country since Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton on Tuesday. Officer Michael Peters\u2019 suspension was announced on Sunday by Traverse City police chief Jeff O\u2019Brien, who earlier said an internal investigation would start on Monday to see whether Peters broke any departmental rules.",
        "Donald Trump should not have been named Time magazine\u2019s Person of the Year. That\u2019s not to make the schoolboy error of presuming the award to be a badge of moral approval: I know it merely recognises the individual who has dominated the previous 12 months, for good or ill. (It\u2019s why Time has no reason to regret handing the 1938 accolade to Adolf Hitler.) Even so, and even though Trump was clearly the biggest news story of 2016, he still should not have won.",
        "\u201cIt is impossible to translate the Qur\u2019an,\u201d writes Kader Abdolah, at the start of his translation of the Qur\u2019an. Prior to Abdolah \u2014 then a popular \u00e9migr\u00e9 Iranian novelist in the Netherlands \u2014 had never even read the Qur\u2019an, despite being raised in a Muslim family. But with the fall of the twin towers came the necessity to do so the new focus on Islamic extremism in the West meant that suddenly everyone had opinions about the book, although most had not read it. As a leading voice in the liberal Netherlands, Abdolah was expected to have a view.",
        "The Turnbull government has given its strongest signal yet that a deal is in the wind with the United States to settle 1, 800 refugees from Nauru and Manus Island. The Australian newspaper reported Australia and the US were expected to announce the resettlement arrangement within days. Speculation has been mounting about a deal since Australia announced at Barack Obama\u2019s global migration summit in New York in September that it would take refugees from camps in Costa Rica.",
        "The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has refused to rule out executing the ringleaders of last week\u2019s failed coup, despite repeated warnings from western leaders who said the use of the death penalty would end Turkish hopes of joining the European Union. \u201cThe people have the opinion that these terrorists should be killed,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said in interview for CNN on Monday night. \u201cWhy should I keep them and feed them in prisons for years to come? That\u2019s what the people say.",
        "Of all modern myths, it is the fall of the child star that most compels us. Whether they\u2019re embarking on marriages, throwing bongs out of windows or abandoning monkeys at customs, we can\u2019t seem to get enough. There\u2019s something pathological in our need to tear down our icons of innocence, which might explain the overprotective nature of Macaulay Culkin\u2019s US publicist, who wants to see all my questions upfront. I refuse. I thought we could just . .. have a chat? The interview, Culkin\u2019s biggest in 10 years, is supposed to focus on his comeback."
