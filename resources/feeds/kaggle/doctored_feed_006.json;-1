        "I used to collect weed from a guy who I \u2019 ll called Garrett. He was one of several \u201c unlicensed pharmacists \u201d I dealt with in those days. He smoked really good, brewing pot that smelled like orange peels and Christmas leaves and made your scalp tingle. The trick was that you had to hang out with Garrett to enjoy it. He lived in a dark terrarium of a little apartment on the east end of Athens, Georgia.",
        "The union that was a driving force behind the proposal for $ 15 minimum wage bill is planning to cut its state budgets by 30 % in anticipation of the Donald Trump administration, according to an FBI memo. The Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) president, Mary Elizabeth Henry, has told Bloomberg that \u201c [ b ] ecause the far right will control all three ministries of the federal government, we will pose serious threats to the ability of working people to work together in unions \u201d and that talks would start tomorrow, with a 10 % budget reduction by this point.",
        "Hillary Clinton took another swipe at Donald Trump \u2019 s mental state on Friday, declaring at a truck stop in South Beach that the Republican nominee is \u201c temperamentally unfit \u201d for the White House. \u201c Why does he do things like that? \u201d Clinton demanded at a meeting in Coral Springs, responding to Trump \u2019 s early night assault on former drag queen Alicia Machado, which started the day \u2019 s political scandal. \u201c Who gets up at three o \u2019 clock in the morning to engage in a psychological attack against the former Miss Universe? \u201d Trump issued a string of tweets between 5. 14am and 5.",
        "Barack Obama has ordered US investigators to review evidence of American interference in the 2016 presidential election after coming under sustained fire from congressional Democrats. The report will be one of Obama \u2019 s personal instructions to the intelligence agencies, which will soon report to Donald Trump, whom congressional Democrats consider the beneficiary of a hack targeting the Democratic National Committee. Michael Monaco, the White House counterterrorism director, announced what she called a \u201c full review \u201d at a presidential briefing sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor on Friday.",
        "A few nights later the University of Florida chemistry professor Katheryn Russell \u2011 Brown watched four nights on ESPN debate Colin Kaepernick \u2019 s refusal to stand for the United States national flag. For several minutes the three argued about whether the San Francisco 49ers quarterback was interested in using the anthem to cast a light on racial inequities in their nation. They spoke of soldiers killed at war, veterans who die and the meaning of the US anthem. The debate raged until finally realizing the one thing they had not seen were the issues about which Kaepernick is protesting.",
        "Iceland Airwaves might not have the AR reputation of surrounded by South West or CMJ, but it does showcase as wide a variety of Irish music as any festival, both local and international ( with an obvious focus on Icelandic and Scandinavian festivals ). And the bookers deserve a mention because they \u2019 ve found that wherever you alight, at whichever of the dozen or so locations in town ( with a couple on the night ) you \u2019 re bound to find things of interest. You could even see it as a festival done in the image of the nation \u2019 s totemic individualist and experimentalist, Bj\u00f6rk.",
        "If there was a play that knew everything about what Robert Harris III \u2019 s career would become, it was one the play he threw in the shadows of his first NFL game, far from the cameras and prying eyes in the darkness. Few in the New Orleans Superdome that night in September 2012 noticed when Atlanta \u2019 s new quarterback inexplicably moved ahead of Alfred Smith and knocked the Saints \u2019 Terry Harper to the ground. But it should have been perfect for the weeks and years to come. And for a football life that must be finished.",
        "When Donald Trump swears at the inauguration that he will \u201c faithfully execute the role of president of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the government of the United States \u201d he will be committing a violation of constitutional liberty. The US constitution thus prohibits any \u201c Person holding any title of Profit or Trust under [ the United States ] \u201d from accepting \u201c any present, Emolument, Patent, or Title, of any kind whatsoever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State \u201d.",
        "David is enthusiastic about my ability to knock him out, particularly the fact he \u2019 s carrying a large pistol holstered to his belt. \u201c If you were a bad guy right now and you tried to punch me in the mouth and knock me out with the \u2018 knock out game \u2019 \u2014 who \u2019 s there to do something about it for me? \u201d he says, striding toward a local rally supported by his supporters, Bikers for Trump, a vigilante collective of lawyers and law enforcement personnel from across America.",
        "Our elders have taught us that if the zuzeca sape, the black devil, comes across our lands, our world will end. Zuzeca has appeared \u2014 in the form of the Dakota River pipeline \u2014 and so I must believe. I am Lakota, born in Rosebud, South Dakota, and writing from the frontline of the movement against the pipeline in Cannon Ball. I have been walking this ground with my Standing Stone Sioux tribe ever since the spring. I am protecting the land and water of my ancestors, as my ancestors did before me. The $ 3.",
        "This year \u2019 s football playoffs have found their bearings now, thumping into the title holders with frosty glares. The Kansas City Thunder became the bad guys of the season when they broke up what was probably Joe Duncan \u2019 s last championship run. And now they are trying to take the Golden State Warriors \u2019 joy. OKC swaggered onto the third floor Monday night no longer the young, promising team of a few years ago but gruff outsiders scarred by disappointments and looking to stomp on ahead. There \u2019 s nothing fun about this Oklahoma City team.",
        "Fresh from his Thanksgiving Florida break, Donald Trump is due to finalise his cabinet in the coming days in an unconventional presidential transition that has kept supporters and critics alike in suspense as to the true nature of his administration. The has so far adopted a pick\u2019n\u2019mix approach to his appointments, embracing both loyalists and rivals, both career politicians and outsiders with little salient experience. He has similarly been a shape shifter on policy, tempering numerous campaign promises and spitting out random ideas, such as his undiplomatic proposal that Nigel Farage become British ambassador to the US.",
        "It was the and we were on the verge of making it big all over the world, having just released Sparkle in the Rain. However, as with many UK bands, the US was proving tough to crack. Then our record company came to us with an idea. The director John Hughes was making a movie called The Breakfast Club, and they thought it would be a great vehicle for their bands. All this sounded great until they said: \u201cAnd we\u2019ve got a song for you. \u201d Being chippy Glaswegians, we said: \u201cWhat? Nah, we write our own songs.",
        "Donald Trump will not give up his role as an executive producer of The Celebrity Apprentice, the reality TV show\u2019s studio said on Thursday, confirming a continuing business entanglement of the but not its details.

        "So Murray marches on, winning in under two hours again, clearly determined not to suffer a repeat of his French Open exertions and waste too much energy in the early rounds. He\u2019s into his ninth consecutive Wimbledon where he\u2019ll face Tsonga on Wednesday. He beat the Frenchman here in 2010 and 2012 and has won 12 of their 15 meetings. Thanks for reading. That\u2019s all from me today. Bye. Serving for the match, Murray seems to lose concentration, knocking a forehand too long for .",
        "The global economy has expanded greatly since the early 1980s, thanks to technology breakthroughs, the opening of markets and trade being more accessible. Today, trade generates $15tn annually. Nearly $5tn in goods and services flows in and out of the US alone each year. This development has affected people across socioeconomic classes. Former US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson noted in a recent column that the average household income in America is about $10, 000 more than it would have been without this trade progress.",
        "When an Oregon judge declared Jamie Shupe could legally shed the designation of male or female, Shupe felt free. \u201cI have my life back,\u201d Shupe said. \u201cI\u2019m not a male. I\u2019m not a female. \u201d Shupe appears to be the first person in the United States who has successfully petitioned for a gender classification, according to Hayley Gorenberg, deputy legal director for Lambda Legal, a New gay rights organization. \u201cClassic gender markers don\u2019t fit everybody,\u201d Gorenberg said, calling the petition significant for helping people \u201cexist without labels that don\u2019t accurately describe them\u201d.",
        "First came the revelation that the Great British Bake Off was leaving the BBC for Channel 4. However, the news that presenters Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc will not be going with it has been particularly hard to swallow for diehard fans \u2014 if the anguish vented on social media is anything to go by. There was also dismay from former contestants and celebrities. Among them was Richard Burr, who took part in the 2014 series. Another 2014 contestant, Martha Collison, described the duo as \u201cirreplaceable\u201d.",
        "Republican opponents of Donald Trump in Congress described meetings with the presumptive GOP nominee as awkward on Thursday and sparred with him, while Trump\u2019s supporters raved about his visit to Capitol Hill. Trump held separate meetings with both the House and Senate caucuses on a sweltering summer day as he tried to continue to unify the GOP behind him. The Republican nominee, accompanied by his daughter Ivanka, Jared Kushner and chief strategist Paul Manafort, started the day by meeting with House Republicans at the Capitol Hill Club.",
        "They are a particularly tough audience \u2014 picky, moody, often impossible to please \u2014 but cats represent an untapped music market, according to one of the world\u2019s biggest record labels. Universal Music has announced it will be the first major label to release an album that is not for human consumption \u2014 although, until cats get bank accounts, humans will have to pay for it.

        "Perry, a African grey parrot, is for sale on a pet trade website for \u00a3750. She looks in good condition with her large black bill, red tail and white mask and her owner says she can whistle the tune of Flower of Scotland, does a passable imitation of R2D2 and is \u201cvery clever and funny\u201d. What Perry\u2019s Scottish owner does not tell prospective buyers is that the African grey is close to extinction in the wild largely because of the international pet trade.",

A Tampa police report said Joaquin Mendez put on the vest late on Saturday and \u201cwondered aloud whether it still worked\u201d.

        "The word surreal is overused and often wrongly used, but in the case of the Washington Post Election Night Live party, the word was apt. First of all, it was a disco. There was a DJ playing a frenetic mix of contemporary Top 40 and pointedly apropos songs such as Pat Benatar\u2019s \u201cHit Me With Your Best Shot\u201d (\u201cYou\u2019re a real tough cookie with a long history \u2026 \u201d ).

        "On 8 November, voters in California, Maine, Massachusetts and Nevada approved ballot measures to legalize recreational cannabis. It is now legal in a total of eight states. This creates potential problems for road safety. How do we determine who\u2019s impaired and who\u2019s not? The effects of alcohol vary based on a person\u2019s size and weight, metabolic rate, related food intake and the type and amount of beverage consumed. Even so, alcohol consumption produces fairly straightforward results: the more you drink, the worse you drive.",
        "The father of an American Muslim killed in the US military in Iraq stunned the Democratic convention on Thursday night with a powerful challenge to Donald Trump, who he said had \u201csacrificed nothing and no one\u201d.

        "Nasa added more than 1, 200 new planets to the known galaxy on Tuesday, more than doubling the number of confirmed planets orbiting alien stars. Revealing data from the Kepler space telescope, the astronomers said that the discovery is a step toward finding planets. \u201cThis gives us hope that somewhere out there, around a star much like ours, we can eventually discover another Earth,\u201d said Ellen Stofan, Nasa\u2019s chief scientist. Analysis on data from Kepler found that 1, 284 candidates have a 99% chance of being a planet, of 4, 302 potential planets detected by the telescope.",
        "A library in Alabama has reportedly warned its customers that it plans to enforce strict new borrowing rules that include the possibility of jail time for anyone who fails to return a book on time. In an effort to recoup about $200, 000 worth of overdue books, the public library will be enforcing a new policy that includes fines of $100, a city jail term of 30 days or possibly both, according to the News Courier. Library director Paula Laurita said the harsh new rules were necessary because offenders were effectively stealing from the library and taxpayers.",
        "B efore Bob Dylan came along, there were famous poets \u2014 people bought collections of Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton they looked to their confessional stanzas of recollections to feel the pain and balm. Yes, Robert Lowell was a celebrity. Bob Dylan put poetry out of business. He invented the . He created the more efficient delivery system. When I started writing, I knew I had to compete with what Bob Dylan did with language, because he preempted emotion on the page. I had to tell the truth. I had to be utter. I had to go to extremes.",
        "The Hills: That Was Then, This Is Now, Can you believe that it has been 10 years since the seminal \u201creality\u201d show The Hills debuted on MTV? Yes, that means you are old. In this special, star Lauren Conrad catches us up on where her life is now and goes back to revisit some of the show\u2019s classic moments and see how she feels about them now. Over the past decade, the curtain has been ripped back repeatedly to expose just how scripted the show really was, so this should be interesting.",
        "Following their meeting on Wednesday, Mexico\u2019s president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, insisted he told Donald Trump, during their meeting in Mexico City, that Mexico would not pay for a border wall between their two countries. \u201cAt the start of the conversation with Donald Trump, I made clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall,\u201d Pe\u00f1a Nieto tweeted. A spokesman for the Mexican president later told the Guardian that there was no discussion of paying for the wall because Trump did not respond to Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s statement. \u201cThe president told him clearly and the matter was not discussed further."
