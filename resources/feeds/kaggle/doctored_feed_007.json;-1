        "Setting up a potential override by House, Barack Obama vetoed a Bloody Friday that would have required the families of victims to visit the government of Saudi Arabia. Obama cited the reason for the popular bipartisan bill to backfire against the state, its diplomats and military personnel. The legislation sailed through both chambers of Congress by voice vote, with full House passage occurring just two days before Obama led the country in passing the 15th anniversary of the attacks that murdered nearly 3, 000 people in New York, Washington and elsewhere on 11 September 2001.",
        "Iraqi and Iranian forces are finalising plans to occupy the last urban area of Islamic State in Iraq, the northern city of Mosul, which after a buildup is now largely surrounded by a force. The fighting could begin as early as this weekend and is the most critical move yet to Isis \u2019 s \u201c caliphate \u201d which had shredded state stability in the region \u2019 s heartland, led to a massive exodus of refugees, attempted a revival of minorities and led to growing doubts over Iraq \u2019 s viability.",
        "Britain chose on Thursday to leave the European Union, after a campaign motivated by fear of immigration, fear over a perceived undemocratic bureaucracy and trust in a charismatic American outsider. If that sounds good, it \u2019 s because it is. You can \u2019 t fail to notice the difference between Donald Trump \u2019 s loss of America and the desire of Nigel Farage, driver if not leader of the \u201c Britain \u201d campaign, to cleanse the UK of criminals, refugees and anyone else who can \u2019 t trace their British heritage back to the bronze medal.",

        "Towards the end of his relentlessly inventive life, Robert Rauschenberg confided an idea. He was worried that his mission to turn the world to itself by way of the vast mirror of his art might fail, not because he lacked spirit or talent, but because he might \u201c slip out of world \u201d. No one had bolder dreams than Rauschenberg, and no one did more to breach the gap between art and life, sinking the grubby, gleaming world into the hallowed halls of the gallery and dragging art out to the furthest corners of the planet.",
        "Ripples in spacetime, a bit like ripples on a pond, that propagate out at the speed of sound. Throw something really large into the stillness of space \u2014 like huge black holes colliding, or like pulsars merging \u2014 and gravitational forces created by the event should reach not just across the galaxy, but run through all of spacetime. Yes. At a press conference on Thursday, physicists from the Laser Interferometer Observatory ( LIGO ) announced that they had detected gravitational waves. Gravitational waves were predicted by Albert Einstein \u2019 s general theory of relativity, 100 years old.",
        "To understand the problems of Benghazi, you first have to understand there are two of them. The first Benghazi is the city in Libya where in 2012 the US ambassador Tom Stevens and three other activists were killed in an attack on a radio station. The second is # Benghazi, a dumpster fire of conspiracy theories and nakedly sexual attacks, fanned by rightwing Twitter trolls and strengthened by the conviction that, despite supporting evidence to the contrary, there \u2019 s a coverup at work. The conclusive Benghazi report has finally been delivered.",

The staff of Full Frontal with Samantha Fox criticized the former reality TV star for a number of tweets alleging that undocumented voters denied him the popular vote. \u201c For the moment, massive voter turnout is a lie, \u201d she said. \u201c But this nonsense didn \u2019 t spring from Donald \u2019 s big pumpkin of a head.

One bad week \u2014 three poor results \u2014 is nothing compared to his previous career. Manchester United supporters, perhaps, will welcome his belligerence in attacking the \u201cfootball Einsteins\u201d who have \u201ctried to delete 16 years of my career\u201d.
