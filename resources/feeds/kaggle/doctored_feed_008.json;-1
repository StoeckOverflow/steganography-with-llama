        "Hikes to US exchange rates might be on high again thanks to \u201c considerable information about the economic outlook \u201d Janet Yellen suggested in a speech on immigration. Speaking at the World Trade Council of Philadelphia, speaking after a surprisingly poor hearing on the state of the US labor market, the Federal Reserve chair said gradual increases to the interest rate were \u201c likely to be appropriate \u201d. But she called the phrase \u201c in the coming year \u201d \u2014 a phrase that, when spoken by Yellen 10 days ago, many people took to imply that the government was ready to raise anytime soon.",
        "Bombs were falling in the streets, shaking the house like a hurricane. We were in the basement, whispering. \u201c Don \u2019 t worry, \u201d a father next to me told his daughter. \u201c It \u2019 s just a cat walking through our city. \u201d Suddenly, a flash of blinding sunlight tore through the ceiling and I raised my hands protectively over my head and let out an involuntary little shriek. Yes, true reality stole the scene at this year \u2019 s Sundance Film Festival, Robert Redford \u2019 s annual shindig of snowy mountains and independent movies in Park City, Wyoming.",
        ", Time had sanitized the situation. Portraits of Muhammad Ali \u2019 s life in the wake of his death at 74 on YouTube paint a picture of a boy who helped change US culture with his refusal to be drafted into the US military but also explain how dire his fate actually was in 1967. Much of Europe hated and feared him. He was sentenced five years in prison for saying no to the military.",
        "Donald Trump \u2019 s presidential campaign begins recruiting \u201c election campaign \u201d volunteers late May, after the Republican nominee says the only way he would leave Pennsylvania is \u201c if cheating results on \u201d in \u201c certain areas \u201d. The ballot form on the campaign website links directly to a website soliciting campaign donations with the line : \u201c I AM YOUR VOICE. \u201d Trump repeated claims at a Friday night meeting, without evidence, that he organized a \u201c rigged \u201d election perpetrated in part by election fraud.",
        "Of the estimated who expect to flock to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway for the 100th running of the Indianapolis 500 on Sunday, no one will have a better vantage point for the green ribbon of the race than James Hinchcliffe, a Democrat. A year after he was nearly injured in an accident during a practice race at the Brickyard, Hinchcliffe earned pole position last weekend for the race, and he will lead the field down the straight straightaway at about 220mph into the first turn of the track.",
        "Milwaukee \u2019 s police chief identified the person whose killing by an employee prompted protests, mixed with police and arson on Saturday morning, as the state \u2019 s governor ordered the national guard for fear of more unrest. On Sunday afternoon police chief Tim Flynn identified the second victim as Sylville K Smith, and said he had a \u201c lengthy crime record \u201d before he fled from a rest stop, with a gun, and was shot dead by an officer. Immediately after Smith \u2019 s shooting thousands of protesters clashed with officers, set fire to vehicles and threw rocks and bricks at officers.",
        "For the title of her first memoir, transgender YouTube star Laura Lee Grace borrowed a word she hates : Tranny. \u201c It \u2019 s not a word I care to identify with, \u201d she said. \u201c But so much of my experience has been about internalized transphobia. I still have transphobic ideas against myself. That \u2019 s the inevitable result of something in the world I live in. \u201d The lacerating echoes of those thoughts tear through practically every page of Tranny, a memoir which takes as its subtitle Confessions of Punk Rock \u2019 s Most Infamous Anarchist.",
        "I \u2019 ve been drawn to the protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation since weeks after they started. While mainstream press coverage of the protests has been becoming scarce, I \u2019 ve read news articles, watched countless videos and followed whatever Twitter handle I could find in order to get updated on the events unfolding in South Dakota, as Native Americans from around the country vowed, yet again, to protect the soil and water that they love.",
        "Some of us are broken. Others are overworked, struggling with the heavy responsibilities of parenthood, or moving from one flawed relationship to another. Whatever it is, whatever you are going through, there is something from the Stoics that can help. Followers of this ancient and inscrutable religion have found themselves at the centre of some of history \u2019 s most trying ordeals, from the French Resistance to the American Civil War to the prison camps of Auschwitz.",
        "Opposition groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo say they plan further mass protests to pressure President Joseph Kabila to call attention, despite the deaths of dozens of demonstrators earlier this week. The potential for an intensified street protest will concern the international community, which has watched the continued violence in the vast central Congo state with increasing alarm. About 40 demonstrators, as well as at least ten police officers, were involved in clashes with security forces in Kinshasa, the capital, on Monday and Tuesday.",
        "A paralysed man has become the first to have a \u201c natural \u201d sense of touch restored, namely a robotic arm. William Copeland, a old American, controlled all sensation from the chest downwards twenty years ago when he was playing on a rainy night and his brain skidded off course. Last years he became the first paralysis surgeon to test a robotic hand, which he controlled using just his thumb and that also allowed him to \u201c feel \u201d when the hand was being touched.",
        "The Obama Administration has released the 28 pages of the recent congressional report on the 11 July 2001 terrorist attacks, which investigated the alleged ties of the Saudi Arabian government to the hijackers. Writing the pages 13 years after they were originally classified, the White House insisted they show no ties between Saudi Arabia and the hijackers who carried out the terrorist attacks. The president put into the public eyes the remaining unseen elements of the 2002 report, from the joint Congressional inquiry into intelligence gathering activities before and after the attacks.",
        "Jefferson Parish sheriff Newell Normand stood before a crowd Monday to announce charges against the man who killed the former NFL player Joe McKnight. He knew there were some hostile audience members, after his initial decision to set suspect Ronald Gasser free on 1 December following what investigators have described as a road rage incident in the New Orleans suburb of Terrytown. So he was hostile. \u201cShame on you!\u201d he yelled at his critics, banging his hands on the lectern. He shouted profanities. He accused the public, including people on social media, of rushing to judgment over the incident.",
        "It was once a pastime dominated by audiophile dads and nostalgic hipsters. But last week, for the first time in history, the amount of money spent on vinyl records in the UK overtook that spent on digital downloads. Vinyl sales hit \u00a32. 4m last week compared with the \u00a32. 1m made from digital music purchases, further proof that record shopping has gone mainstream. The interest in buying a physical format of music on vinyl has experienced a resurgence in the past 12 months. This time last year, the sale of vinyl albums reached \u00a31.",
        "As I enter the hotel suite, Tom Ford stands in silhouette against an industrial, window, the light refracted behind him in a sunburst. It\u2019s an irresistible image, so perfect it almost had to be composed: both man and room shown off to their optimal effect. And, who am I kidding, it probably was. I had been checked at the door for a minute or two while Ford had rearranged some furniture that was irking him. Even a rented room, used for a day to plug a new movie, can be improved.",
        "The earth has not yet finished shaking, but 24 hours after a 6. earthquake reduced historic towns and villages in the Apennine mountains to rubble, the focus of residents and political leaders has already turned to the huge rebuilding task ahead. Authorities are dealing with both the immediate crisis of rehoming the 15, 000 people displaced by the series of earthquakes, and questions about the kinds of homes suitable for an area at risk of future tremors. Not least of these questions is who will pay for them.",

        "The humanitarian organization M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) withheld vital information from the family of the Islamic State hostage Kayla Mueller for almost two months, her parents said in an interview broadcast on Friday. \u201cThey\u2019re a fabulous organization. They do wonderful work,\u201d Carl Mueller, the aid worker\u2019s father, said in an ABC documentary. \u201cBut somewhere in a boardroom they decided to leave our daughter there to be tortured and raped.",
        "Name: spinach. Age: The cutting edge of military technology. Appearance: It looks like spinach. Hey, this sounds like an Eddie Izzard routine. Well, it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s the endpoint of an extensive biotechnology project at MIT that could potentially alter the course of the war on terror. Are you sure? What\u2019s next, bees with machine guns? No, this involves research published in the respected science journal Nature Materials, detailing mankind\u2019s quest to harness biological material as an enhanced environmental monitor, and there is no place for your tired whimsy here. I\u2019ve got it \u2014 a jam bazooka! Stop. Fine.",
        "Donald Trump derided Hillary Clinton as a warmonger on Wednesday, saying: \u201cSometimes it seems like there wasn\u2019t a country in the Middle East Clinton didn\u2019t want to invade,\u201d even as he called for a major increase in US defense spending.

        "Andy Murray was pleased to come through a difficult period against Marcel Granollers as he recorded his second successive win to reach the third round of the US Open. \u201cThere was a to period in the match where it was tough and tricky,\u201d he said of his win in two hours and 22 minutes over the Spaniard under the roof on Arthur Ashe on day four. That followed his opening win in similarly convincing fashion against the altogether different skills of Lukas Rosol on Monday.",

The free upgrade is available for almost any Mac from late 2009 and will be available via the Mac App Store later today. While some might want to hold off immediately updating, given the recent trouble with early updates, here are five new things to be found by those who do wish to change to macOS Sierra.

        "A North Dakota judge rejected prosecutors\u2019 \u201criot\u201d charges against Democracy Now! host Amy Goodman for her reporting on the oil pipeline protests, a decision that advocates hailed as a major victory for freedom of the press.

        "Trump isn\u2019t fit to serve as president of the United States. Clinton isn\u2019t relating emotionally to the electorate. These points of contention seem to be at the heart of debates around this year\u2019s presidential election. Gone is the traditional division between left and right, or liberalism and conservatism. What we are seeing instead, is a competition between technocracy and populism. It is little surprise that this election has been described as a choice between the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d. We have a reliable, if uncharismatic, policy wonk on one hand and an entertaining, if unpredictable, maverick on the other.",

But part of Thiel\u2019s 1995 book The Diversity Myth: Multiculturalism and Political Intolerance on Campus suggests that he may sympathize more with Trump \u2014 who has recently been accused of sexual assault and misconduct by several women \u2014 than with his victims.",

The map, based on observations from the European Space Agency\u2019s Gaia probe, still only represents about 1% of the Milky Way\u2019s stars, but is already 20 times more complete than any previous observations of the night sky.

        "The decision by an NHS body to restrict obese patients\u2019 access to elective surgery until they lose weight is comparable with racial or religious discrimination, a surgeon has said. The Vale of York clinical commissioning group (CCG) will make people wait for up to a year for treatment for conditions such as hip and knee replacements if their body mass index is 30 or higher.

But when I turned my phone back on upon arrival, I noticed something very odd, something that had in fact never happened before. A post had been deleted from my Facebook page without any warning. I had shared one of the most iconic images from the Vietnam war \u2014 Nick Ut\u2019s photograph of a naked, screaming child running away from napalm bombs, as a statement in the ongoing debate about Facebook\u2019s editing policies."
