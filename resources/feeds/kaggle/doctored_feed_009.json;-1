        "Did I ever tell you that Frank Thomas was in my elementary school physical education class? Yes, that Frank Thomas, the major league first baseman known as \u201c The Big Hurt \u201d. One time we \u2019 d play right in fourth period and everyone would come up to play, everybody in the outfield would start walking backwards, because when someone hit the ball, it was actually going over the fence and into the parking lot of the housing project next to the school.",
        "Imagine a chainsmoker comes in to see you who has lung cancer. You tell him to stop drinking, and he starts bargaining. He \u2019 s decided to give up donuts. You say donuts don \u2019 t involve lung cancer, so he needs to stop watching Game of Thrones. What \u2019 s clear is that he doesn \u2019 t intend to start smoking, and he doesn \u2019 t want to worry about any correlation to lung cancer. That \u2019 s about where this country is on gun politics. It \u2019 s weird that the gesture of a is now being used to support gun rights that apparently includes the state.",
        "In this new year, anonymous writers remember the most painful moment of their lives : the moment they knew their friendship was over, We were paired by her best friend. I was exceedingly naive, and though no good, was blindsided by my first taste of safe sex. We lived apart for a year while I completed a master \u2019 s degree in 20th century writing and she worked as a legal scholar. She had tried university herself for a week at the urging of girlfriends but quickly realized that further time in a classroom left no interest.",
        "If international sport officials were expecting an investigation from Russia after the latest news of its doping at the London Olympics and other games, they were disappointed. Continuing a campaign of argument that began after the first allegations of Russian excessive performance enhancing drugs use in 2014, officials in Russia dismissed the accusations and declared the report was politicised. One country even called on the president Donald Trump, who has spoken favourably of Russia, to stop the trial.",
        "Temperatures in the Arctic in the last two months have reached more than 20C above normal for the time of year. Temperatures that unusual in the UK and Europe would produce 45C tops. As a result, sea ice has shrunk to levels that scientists describe as \u201c off the scale \u201d. Mapping the changes to the level of sea ice over the next 40 years confirms that : on a planet, the lines are clustered together like threads in a hank of silk, soaking and cooling in line with each other \u2014 until this disappears.",
        "Prince Harry has taken part in almost a minute \u2019 s silence in remembrance of Fidel Castro. The potentially embarrassing visit took place during a trip to the Caribbean island of St Vincent. The prince addressed local dignitaries at a reception in the capital, Kingstown, hosted by the Caribbean Island \u2019 s governor general, Lord Frederick Ballantyne.

        "MIA has accused the MTV Video Music Channel of \u201c racism, sexism, classism, elitism \u201d after the video for her song Borders was not included on this year \u2019 s nominee list. The song makes a statement on the migrant crisis, portraying dozens of men packed on flotilla ships, while others scale Russian border fences covered with barbed wire. The VMA shortlist, announced late this week, is dominated by Madonna \u2019 s Lemonade, an artist MIA condemned this season for not being vocal about issues including Black Lives Matter. \u201c Is Beyonc\u00e9 or Kendrick Lamar going to say Muslim Rights Matter?

        "The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has suggested that the Olympic movement may \u201c wind up on the edge of schism \u201d after a damning investigation found that the country \u2019 s military, security services and civil authorities colluded to hide Olympic doping across \u201c a vast whole \u201d of winter and summer camps.

Some officials have chosen to keep the \u201c biscuit \u201d on them, although that is not foolproof. Jimmy Carter put his in his clothes when he sent them to the. Hillary Clinton had it in his wallet with his ID cards, but then lost the keys.",
        "Today we show you two updates from Muncie in issue eight of our series \u2014 a series in which Gary asks whether the deep divides raised by this election can be reconciled afterwards, and speaks with residents about the electoral issues they consider crucial. Over the past few weeks we \u2019 ve been asking everyone who live and work in Muncie to help guide and shape the Middletown campaign. They have been sharing the issues they think are important, and suggesting who Gary should meet in the city.",
        "In any election campaign, politics and current issues dominate Saturday Night Live, and that was certainly the norm in 2016. And in a year with fairly frequent changes in the cast and hosting staff, the quality of the new host affected the audience massively \u2014 if only they could all be Tom Hanks. Christine McKinnon was the clear breakout star of the show, bringing both technical expertise and nuanced characterization to both her Hillary Clinton and Kellyanne Conway impressions, while Kenan Smith remained the show \u2019 s most stalwart.",

        "The Chinese navy has seized an underwater drone in plain sight of the American sailors who had deployed it in international waters, in a seemingly brazen message to the incoming Trump administration.

        "As Bea Sousa went to cast her vote early at Muncie\u2019s courthouse a couple weeks ago, the historic symbolism of the moment crept up on her unawares. She paused to take it in. \u201cI found myself just standing there for a moment, thinking, \u2018Wow. This is great,\u2019\u201d says Sousa, 75, the former spokesperson for the League of Women Voters of County, formed from the American movement for womens\u2019 suffrage. \u201cI realised for a long time that I would be voting for a woman for president but I didn\u2019t even think about it going into the election room.",

Only a handful of them, however, will return home to their countries with medals. Even fewer will find monetary rewards for the tremendous investment many have had to make to reach the Rio games. Of course, a tiny handful with particularly compelling stories \u2014 assuming they bring home gold \u2014 will sign lucrative deals with sponsors.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chair on Saturday led a chorus of Democratic party fury over the FBI\u2019s decision to review a new batch of her staff\u2019s emails, which was announced just 11 days before the presidential election in a striking break with law enforcement tradition. The Clinton campaign launched an extraordinary criticism of James Comey, the director of the FBI, who faced anger for his dramatic and late intervention in the race, which deviated from FBI protocol. Comey stood accused of betraying the bureau\u2019s political neutrality, and came under growing pressure to make public everything he knows.",

The Republican presidential nominee wants two of the three debates moved to avoid clashing with televised NFL games.

        "The weekend\u2019s seemingly disjointed events \u2014 a bombing in New York City, several unexploded bombs discovered in New Jersey, multiple stabbings in a mall in Minnesota \u2014 has set Americans on edge again. It remains unclear if these acts were part of a grand international conspiracy, or whether a cell or single individuals are behind them. Yet what we do know is that we now inhabit an age in which it\u2019s logistically straightforward to commit attacks designed to kill and create mayhem, and there are clear ideological rationales for doing so.",
        "What\u2019s the name of this show? The Good Place, When does it premiere? There is a premiere on Monday 19 September at 10pm ET right after The Voice so it can get plenty of attention. Then it settles into its regular time slot on Thursday at 8. 30pm ET, right after Superstore. Oh man, NBC Thursday comedies have sucked lately. Yes, they sure have. The network went broad and in a bid to be CBS and grab some of that Big Bang Theory syndication cash.",
        "The Eurospy era, during which French, Italian and German producers competed to see who could release the cheapest James Bond at the height of the suave British secret agent\u2019s success, may now belong to some deeply dubious 1960s belle \u00e9poque, but 007 continues to have his imitators across the globe.

But conservative women say that it would be a mistake to think of her as solely involved or interested in countering the feminist agenda. They credit her reach as spreading far beyond that, to empowering women in the conservative movement, many of whom now lead their own national women\u2019s groups whose areas of focus have broadened to include \u201cfree markets\u201d \u201cpersonal liberty\u201d and \u201cfamily values\u201d."
