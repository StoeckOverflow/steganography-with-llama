        "Marlon Byrd \u2019 s failed strike with drugs ended him a full season \u2014 and ending his career. The Indians \u2019 middle outfielder was suspended 162 days without pay by Major League Baseball on Tuesday after testing positive for Ipamorelin, a sex hormone releasing peptide. Byrd \u2019 s lawyer Jay Reisinger claimed in a statement that Byrd tested positive because of a tainted supplement. Byrd won \u2019 t pursue an appeal, Reisinger stated. \u201c Marlon is devastated, but understands that he is responsible for the supplements he takes, \u201d Reisinger said. It \u2019 s Byrd \u2019 s second violation of Minor League Baseball \u2019 s Joint Drug Prevention and Training Program.",
        "People who move around Albany are prone to having to explain that being from New York does not automatically mean that you \u2019 re from New York City. It can be misleading to be constantly explaining that pay is lower, housing is less expensive, there are definitely more pigs than cows and it is, after all, the center of the city \u2019 s government, even if New York City authorities believe they \u2019 re the center of the nation.",
        "Neil Young has called on President Barack Obama to intervene in the South Dakota pipeline standoff and prevent the \u201c unnecessary and violent action \u201d faced by protesters participating at the Standing Rock Crossing. In November, Young celebrated his 71st birthday performing for those at the Fast Access pipeline news site, and on Monday, in a personal Facebook post, he helped Obama step in and \u201c halt the violence \u201d against protesters. \u201c The anger grows as winter progresses, \u201d he wrote together with the journalist Daryl Hannah.",
        "My favorite written form of the summer of 2016 is the occasional email message. When many scholars of literature concentrate on the way that we wrote in this tumultuous, moment, what will they focus on? Perhaps it will be the day these utilitarian missives shifted towards a new kind of magical realism. \u201c I \u2019 m away, \u201d these messages end, dropping into my inbox one after another, \u201c and I have limited access to emails. \u201d Limited access wasn \u2019 t necessarily our collective ambition.",
        "At 8pm Beijing Time on 25 June this year the relative darkness over China \u2019 s Hainan Province was temporarily banished by a bright orange light. Accompanied by the thunderous sounds of engines, a rocket launched itself into the sky. An increasing number of Chinese rockets have followed in the past few years but this milestone was significant for three reasons. It was the first launch of the new Long March 7 rockets, designed to help the crew place a space ship in orbit.",
        "Adam Foss doesn \u2019 t look like your average guy. He wears his hair in loose dreadlocks that flow down to his ankles, and beaded bracelets around his wrists. He spent four years as an assistant district attorney in Boston, but rather than focusing on high death rates or projecting a \u201c focus on crime \u201d attitude, he has been becoming more interested in alternatives to incarceration, and on getting juvenile offenders out of town.",
        "Although they are both credited with inventing cubism, Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque spent most of their lives holding over top billing. Henri Matisse, who gave cubism its name when he derided Braque as a painter of \u201c sugar cubes \u201d feuded with Picasso from the day they were adopted by Gertrude Stein in 1906. For a long time, museums have organized shows pairing Picasso with both artists, and many celebrities, mainly because his name bought tickets, but also because of his desire to absorb new concepts and make them his own.",
        "Matthew Arnold took advantage of one last chance Sunday and Matt Prater redeemed himself with a field goal with eight seconds left to give the Detroit Colts a victory at Indianapolis. Prater kicked an extra point kick right with 4 : 04 left in the game opener, a miscue that nearly ended the Lions. Detroit won for only the fourth time in Indy, and it happened just 37 seconds after it looked like Andrew Luck had swept the Colts for an improbable victory. It just wasn \u2019 t possible to avoid Indy \u2019 s fourth straight opening round loss in a wild field.",
        "A New York City woman identifies her male partner with the Zika vaccine through sex, the first recorded transmission of the germ has been documented. Zika is mostly spread by mosquitoes, though state officials have known for some time that men can spread it through females. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) reported the issue on Friday and updated its program for pregnant women. The CDC now advises such couples to use protection if their partner has traveled to a region, whether the partner is a man or a child.",
        "The US Army has admitted culpability for killing almost two dozen people in a July airstrike outside the Iranian city of Manbij, then the scene of violent fighting with Islamic state militants. By the Pentagon \u2019 s calculations, the strike, which hit the nearby village of Tokhar near Manbij, constituted the single worst source of civilian casualties in the ongoing US war against Isis. But human rights monitors say the US military is already undercounting the death toll, which is substantially lower than the ranges those analysts have compiled.",
        "Last week, it was discovered that the computer servers of the US Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) had been penetrated by multiple sets of intruders, who appear to have been aware of one another \u2019 s movements. The hackers seem to have been able to do whatever they liked, including accessing the DNC \u2019 s server servers. As a result, some ( presumably most ) DNC emails found their way into the public domain via a number of routes, notably WikiLeaks.",
        "Ed Sheeran \u2019 s 2014 radio hit Photograph is at the center of a new $ 20m lawsuit alleging that the \u2019 s ballad copies a song sung by a winner of The X Factor. Attorney Richard Thompson, who recently triumphed on behalf of Marvin Gaye \u2019 s family over the hit Blurred Lines, is representing the songwriters Chris Harrington and Thomas Brown. They say Sheeran \u2019 s Photograph \u201c \u201d copies their 2009 hit Amazing. That song was used as the third single by Michael Cardle, winner of the 2010 season of The X Factor.",
        "Michael Cimino, the director of the Vietnam war classic The Deer Hunter and the infamous epic western Heaven\u2019s Gate, has died. He was 77. Thierry Fremaux, the director of the Cannes film festival, tweeted the news on Saturday, saying: \u201cMichael Cimino has died, in peace, surrounded by friends and the two women who loved him.

        "The ashes of In Cold Blood and Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s author Truman Capote have been sold at auction in Los Angeles for $43, 750 (\u00a333, 800). Kept in a carved Japanese wooden box, the ashes belonged to the late Joanne Carson, wife of the former Tonight Show host Johnny Carson. According to vendor Julien\u2019s Auctions, Carson, who died last year, said that owning the ashes \u201cbrought her great comfort\u201d.

        "Things are happening with rapidity: Brexit, the Turkish coup, Islamist massacres in France, the surrounding of Aleppo, the nomination of Donald Trump. From the USA to France to Britain, the high levels of public racism and xenophobia, reflected now in the outpourings of politicians with poll ratings, have got people asking: is it a rerun of the 1930s? On the face of it, the similarities are real. Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU parallels its panicked decision to quit the gold standard in September 1931 \u2014 the first major country to quit the global economic system.",
        "Eight Syrian refugees have been shot dead by Turkish border guards as they tried to escape northern Syria, a human rights watchdog has claimed. Three children, four women and one man were killed on Saturday night, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. It said a total of 60 Syrian refugees had been shot at the border since the start of the year.

        "My first ever laptop was a MacBook Air. However, the logic board stopped working, and Apple was going to charge $600 to fix it. Technicians have told me it is not worth fixing. At this point in time I cannot afford to buy a new MacBook, so which PC laptop would you recommend? I am a third year social work student, and I won\u2019t really be carrying it to class: it will mostly be used at home. I don\u2019t run any special applications, and my budget is less than $1, 000.",
        "The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, has said his country has \u201ca problem with Islam\u201d and that there are too many illegal migrants arriving in France. He also suggested that today\u2019s \u201cveiled woman\u201d could become a Marianne, the female symbol of the French republic, and attacked his rival Nicolas Sarkozy as \u201cthe little De Gaulle\u201d. The controversial remarks are published in a book, A President Should Not Say That: Secrets of Five Years in Office.",
        "Late last fall, the Washington Nationals and Los Angeles Dodgers had seemingly settled on two white men to manage their teams. This wasn\u2019t much a surprise. Despite league rules that demand clubs interview candidates for their manager and general manager jobs, baseball teams almost never hire candidates of color. Owners and executives tend to hire people like themselves, and since most of the are white, the people they put in charge of their teams are, too. Washington offered their manager\u2019s job to former Padres manager Bud Black, who accepted it and immediately began negotiating a contract.",
        "You could get lost in that photo of Donald Trump and Mitt Romney, couldn\u2019t you? Every time you look at it, another new detail rises to the surface and breaks your heart. The angle of Romney\u2019s eyebrows. The lurch in Trump\u2019s neck. The bottle of wine in the background and the glasses of water on the table. The sensation that Trump has shoved away his plate of scallops and demanded that someone bring him a big bowl of Sugar Puffs and a mixing spoon. But it is Romney\u2019s face that makes this such a fascinating picture. Look at it.",
        "The United States has blacklisted seven Russian businessmen and eight companies and government enterprises over Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and the conflict in Ukraine, the US treasury said in a statement. Moscow described the move as a \u201chostile act. \u201d The sanctions come a month before Barack Obama hands over power to Donald Trump, who has praised the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and said it would be good if the two countries could get along.",
        "\u201cBetter teams than us have found it difficult,\u201d Brendan Rodgers said before this game, but even he cannot have imagined it would be quite this hard. Celtic\u2019s opening night in this season\u2019s Champions League was a long one, a goal coming inside the opening three minutes, another coming inside the closing three minutes and five more between them. Three for Leo Messi, two for Luis Su\u00e1rez and one each for Neymar and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta completed a destruction, Celtic\u2019s worst ever defeat in this competition and Barcelona\u2019s best win. No European club has ever lost by more in this competition.",
        "Nato\u2019s has issued a dramatic warning to the US Donald Trump: \u201cGoing it alone is not an option, either for Europe or for the United States. \u201d Writing exclusively in the Observer, the leader of the western military alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, claims the west faces its greatest security challenge in a generation. He pointedly recalls the blood spilled by Nato allies after they came to the aid of the US following the attacks and warns that, rather than \u201cdeepening differences\u201d between the 28 members, now is the time to \u201cnurture what unites\u201d under \u201cstrong American leadership\u201d.",
        "Nearly half of those arrested by police this year in the Minnesota area where a black man was fatally shot during a traffic stop are African American, according to an analysis of records released this week \u2014 a vastly disproportionate figure to the area\u2019s small total black population. As of 3 July, roughly 47% of the arrests made in 2016 by Saint Anthony Village, Minnesota, police are of African Americans, according to a Guardian analysis of the records, and about 38% of the people arrested since 2011 were black.",
        "It\u2019s George W Bush\u2019s world, and we\u2019re just living in it. Not Donald Trump\u2019s. Not Hillary Clinton\u2019s. Not even Barack Obama\u2019s. No, the unhinged arguments at the heart of the 2016 presidential election are not really a debate about the legacy of the current occupant of the White House. They\u2019re not about Obamacare, or the Recovery Act the Paris climate agreement or even the Iran nuclear deal. They are, at their heart, an unresolved argument about the world as the 43rd president defined it: for worse, for much worse, and then for better.",
        "An abrupt has thwarted efforts by the British security firm Serco to open its first family detention center in Texas. Local officials unanimously voted this week against \u201centering contract agreements\u201d with the company after at least a month of negotiations. Serco had lobbied Jim Wells County to help it enter the US detention market by opening a facility in a closed down nursing home that would hold 500 to 600 women and children facing deportation. This followed a year of lobbying at the federal level.",
        "Making a chess movie is a tricky move. Your first stumbling block is that, of all sports, this must be one of the most uncinematic \u2014 as well as the most baffling for the novice. Even those familiar with the queen\u2019s gambit need a little while to take a look at a board in an apparently tense setup and assess its import for both players. Plus, on the big screen at least, the dramatis personae are rarely appealing.",
        "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has spoken out against Peter Thiel and in defense of Gawker, telling a Los Angeles audience: \u201cBeautiful speech doesn\u2019t need protection. Ugly speech needs protection. That\u2019s where the rubber\u2019s gonna meet the road. \u201d In reference to Peter Thiel\u2019s recent efforts to punish critical reporters in court, he said: \u201cSeek revenge and you should dig two graves, one for yourself. \u201cIs that really how you want to spend your time? As a public figure the best defense to speech that you don\u2019t like is to develop a thick skin.",
        "Urban Outfitters reached a settlement with the Navajo Nation after illegally using the tribe\u2019s name for a collection that included \u201cNavajo hipster panties\u201d and a \u201cNavajo print flask\u201d. The lawsuit was brought against the fashion company in 2012, though it had used the name since 2001. The company claimed that the Navajo should have known that the name had been used to adorn jewelry and clothing for that time, according to the Farmington Daily Times, but a federal judge dismissed their motion in April 2016.",
        "The White House is looking into a cyber breach after what appeared to be a scan of first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s passport was posted online. The fresh disclosures, which included emails to and from White House staff, raised further concerns about the security of sensitive systems following a string of breaches affecting government agencies, private companies and the Democratic National Committee. Though officials declined to say whether the disclosures were authentic, there were no immediate reasons to suspect they were not. The US attorney general, Loretta Lynch, said it was \u201csomething that we are looking into\u201d."
