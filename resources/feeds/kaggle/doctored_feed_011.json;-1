        "You Must Hear This looks back at one of the most fascinating characters from film : Elia Kazan. In 1952, the director of hit films such as A Streetcar Named Desire and On the Waterfront went before Congress and discovered the names of supposed leaders in Hollywood. His words saved careers due to blacklisting and leave a black mark on his own name, too. It is an important story of zealotry and racism gone awry, with plenty of controversy today.",
        "Two orphaned women separated decades ago in South Korea have been found after being hired at the same hospital in Chicago. The women, now both in their 40s, were stunned to find that they were related, having not seen each other since the early 1970s. Both women had experienced tragic losses and spent time at orphanages in South Korea before being adopted by American authorities. As a very young child, \u2014 now identified as Meagan Hughes \u2014 had been taken from her biological father by her mother.",
        "At the height of the Atlantic summer, New Year \u2019 s Eve celebrations in the southern city of Fortaleza attract hundreds of thousands of revellers to the beach. Further south, in the impoverished neighborhood of Dias Macedo, residents sit in the streets to drink, set off fireworks and wait for the sun to rise. This year, however, the celebration ended in tension and tragedy. At around 3am, an actress told her family that a boy, Clayton Sousa, 21, had taken her to a secluded place and sexually assaulted her. The rumor spread, and the crowd of revellers immediately became a mob.",
        "Other People repeats itself in its sequence. A family wails over their recently deceased mother, only to be distracted by an interminable phone message from a hospital friend who calls to check in on her health, then gets distracted by a pressing order to a physician. Chris Kelly, a Pulitzer nominee who currently serves as writing supervisor on Saturday Night Live, goes for the fences in his debut, juggling tragedy with laughs. Remarkably, he succeeds, and the Simpsons recall another tonal tightrope talk about cancer.",
        "Sam Mendes, the creative director of Skyfall and Spectre, said on Twitter he will not direct the next James Bond film. \u201c It was an emotional adventure, I loved every second of it, \u201d Mendes said at the film festival, of his five months working on Bond. \u201c But I know it \u2019 s time for somebody else. \u201d A former theatre producer whose films include the American Beauty and the sombre High Road, Mendes said he believes the next Bond movie would come from an \u201c independent direction \u201d just as he had.",
        "The World of Warcraft adventure game apparently had 12 million players at its peak, and every single one of them is going to need to turn up to enjoy this \u2014 with their extended families \u2014 if it \u2019 s never going to get even its first instalment. It \u2019 s an expensive, bit reminiscent of The Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones. And there \u2019 s much to admire in its ambition, its design, even its politics. But there \u2019 s also a whiff of the original Carter about it.",
        "There was a moment where it felt like the prophecy might come true. Something came out of Latinos in Nevada rushing out in droves to vote against Donald Trump. # SomosElMuro, We Are the Wall, sprang up as a hashtag. Around it, people shared their mental pictures of the demographic that could stop Trump. And then, it evaporated. Apparently, Latinos showed up for early polls, and the majority did throw their weight behind Hillary Clinton, but no sleeping giant remained. Well, one did, but it was March in the Rust Belt, and they voted overwhelmingly for Trump.",
        "A white ruffled coat that was worn by Prince in the movie Purple Rain has sold at auction for 32 times its original price, fetching nearly $ 100, 000. The black ivory silk tie and a blazer from the 1984 film sold for $ 96, 000 ( \u00a372, 300 ) each at the sale in California. Profiles in History author Joe Maddalena said the blazer \u2014 which had an expected price of $ $ 8, 000 ( \u00a3 \u00a36, 000 ) \u2014 was scheduled to be removed before Prince \u2019 s sudden departure in April.",
        "It is and the Venice Lido is a little town baking in the winter. The film festival went down the previous evening, and now the thoroughfare between the festival and the cinemas is deserted except for construction workers in threes and fours dismantling the buildings. The glitz has faded. The stars are fading. Well, most of them. Denzel Washington and Charles Pratt are the last actors standing in this tumbleweed town.",
        "In response to Rudy Giuliani \u2019 s claims about Donald Trump, circa 2012 : Republican Party nominee Donald Trump made his first official foray into American presidential politics in 2011, when he made himself the most public supporter of the \u201c birther \u201d movement, conspiracists who believe the claim that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States and is therefore constitutionally ineligible to rule as president.",
        "A tearful Lynsey Sharp took the decision to overturn rules on testosterone suppression made competing against the women \u2019 s Olympic 800m champion, Caster Semenya, and other hyperandrogenic athletes difficult. The British athlete finished sixth in last night \u2019 s final in Amsterdam as Semenya powered to gold. The West African has made a return to form after the court of appeal for sport overturned a regulation created by the International Association of Athletics Federations which had forced people with naturally high amounts of testosterone to take drugs.",
        "The US government and the CIA are turning a blind eye as Afghanistan \u2019 s foreign agency spends massive donor money on militias which are leading human rights activists that help destabilise the fragile state, according to local and national officials. The Afghan National directorate of security ( NDS ) arms strongmen ready to fight the Taliban and other factions. But some militia leaders use their new power to protect local turf warfare, including against elected party officials, rather than personally. One such commander, Perim Qul, in the southern province of Takhar, has received about $ 85, 000 ( \u00a370, 000 ) to raise 500 men.",
        "In 1988, the British photographer Mark Leckey spent the week in Brighton. He was 24 and looking for work, but he found play \u2014 music at the front doorstep of the Zap nightclub, which promptly kicked off his art work. \u201c I literally walked into this rave where it was made of dry ice, \u201d said Leckey on the phone from PS1, where he opened an album on Sunday. \u201c This guy just stepped out of the dry ice with this smiley face mask on. I thought, here we come.",
        "The following is an alternate version of a speech given by Guardian writer Paul Valenti to Planned Parenthood of the Southern Finger Lakes last week. How is everyone doing? Set for November 8 yet? Today, I was asked to speak about a future for the next hundred years of reproductive choice and equality. It \u2019 s such a wonderful frame \u2014 to talk about what a feminist future would look like.",
        "I am not what most people think of when they imagine a Hispanic immigrant. I am paler than most Americans, I live in a leafy suburb, and my English is better than my Spanish. There\u2019s also the small detail that I do not remember my own immigration. I came to the US shortly after my first birthday, on an American Airlines flight from El Dorado airport in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, to Dulles international airport in the suburbs of Washington DC, in 1999. My parents were both professionals with graduate degrees.",
        "Donald Trump announced on Monday that he has picked the New York billionaire businessman Vincent Viola to be his secretary of the army. Trump has appointed a number of billionaires to his cabinet, along with leading figures from the world of banking, prompting criticism from some quarters, given the success of a presidential campaign built around an appeal to voters. Prior to the appointment of Viola, 60, the net worth of Trump\u2019s cabinet picks was reported to be around $14bn, making it the richest such group ever assembled.",
        "What\u2019s the CIA\u2019s brilliant plan for stopping Russian on the US and their alleged interference with the US election? Apparently, some in the agency want to escalate tensions between the two superpowers even more and possibly do the same thing right back to them. NBC News reported late last week that the CIA is working up blueprints for an \u201cunprecedented cyber covert action against Russia\u201d and it sounds a lot like they\u2019re planning on leaking documents on Vladimir Putin, just as the Russians are accused of doing to the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign.",
        "Religions around the world have interpreted natural phenomena as God\u2019s will for as long as we\u2019ve had gods and religions. But in God\u2019s arsenal of punishments, perhaps none are as storied as the flood. In modern times, conservative evangelicals have claimed floods, such as the one that followed Hurricane Katrina in 2005, are God\u2019s punishment for moral decay. By moral decay, they typically mean abortion or homosexuality. One prominent evangelical who\u2019s a fan of this line of thinking is Tony Perkins, the head of the rabidly Family Research Council.",
        "The US supreme court on Saturday reinstated an Arizona law that makes it a felony to collect early ballots, dealing a blow to Democratic efforts just days before the presidential election. The order from the country\u2019s highest court overturned an appeals court decision from a day earlier that blocked the new law. Democratic groups had already geared up to begin helping voters deliver their ballots to the polls. The supreme court decision calls into question what happens to ballots such groups legally collected from voters in the approximately 20 hours in which the law was blocked.",
        "The departure of 4, 000 rebel fighters and civilians on Thursday completed the evacuation of what was formerly eastern Aleppo. They left the last square kilometre of territory which had remained under nominal rebel control after a Russia and ceasefire effectively ended the battle on 13 December. Since then, about 40, 000 people have left the city amid worsening weather and humanitarian conditions in a fragile and evacuation operation. Rebels had held eastern Aleppo since 2012, but a year of Russian bombing allowed forces to gradually encircle their enclave before finally overrunning it in less than a month.",
        "First leg 21 Feb Second leg 15 Mar, Pep Guardiola will be content with this draw, but Monaco are among the most exciting sides in Europe and perhaps the most underrated team in the competition. Leonardo Jardim has created an exciting side who have scored an incredible 53 goals in 17 Ligue 1 matches. Although Monaco share the goals around impressively, it is notable that Radamel Falcao has found his shooting boots again, scoring five goals in Monaco\u2019s past two games.",
        "A woman performing the national anthem before an NBA preseason game in Miami on Friday protested against racial oppression and police brutality as she did so, kneeling at and wearing a Black Lives Matter . Denasia Lawrence opened her jacket just before she started to sing, revealing the shirt, then dropped to her left knee and performed the song. She said it was her way of protesting against racial oppression. \u201cWe\u2019re being unjustly killed and overly criminalized,\u201d Lawrence wrote early on Saturday in a Facebook post.",
        "An autonomous Uber malfunctioned while in \u201c mode\u201d and caused a near collision in San Francisco, according to a business owner whose account raises new safety concerns about the unregulated technology launch. The car \u2014 which Uber introduced without permits, as part of a testing program that California has deemed illegal \u2014 accelerated into an intersection while the light was still red and while the automation technology was clearly controlling the car, said Christopher Koff, owner of local cafe AK Subs.",
        "The final chapter of the Calais debacle promises to be as depressing as those that preceded it. With around 1, 500 teenage refugees still held in shipping containers on the smouldering site waiting for a decision on their future, French and British officials have embarked on a flurry of undignified diplomatic over who should be responsible for them. For the past 18 months both governments have behaved appallingly in their failure to address the crisis this disorganised denouement is merely the predictable continuation of the chaos that went before.",
        "Just months after hosting the Olympics, the west zone of Rio de Janeiro resembled a war zone this weekend as a police helicopter crashed amid shootouts and murders that left at least 12 people dead. Gunfire was reported in half a dozen locations across the city, highlighting fears of a public security crisis worsened by budget cuts, striking police, a change of government and uncertainties over the future of the favela \u201cpacification\u201d policy.",
        "\u2019s impish cameo in Captain America: Civil War turned doubters into true believers. After two middling Amazing movies starring the unfortunate Andrew Garfield, Marvel managed to make the masked feel fresh again, merely by introducing him into a more colourful and diverse universe of superheroes where Spidey is no longer required to beat up Flash Thompson, or grieve for Uncle Ben, every second movie. But can the studio restore the webslinger to his rightful position on the tallest plinth in the comic book movie pantheon when he no longer has dozens of former or future Avengers for company?",
        "They come with their fathers, they come with their mothers. They come with their grandmothers and grandfathers and uncles and aunts, some of them dabbing tears from their eyes. They stand outside the Vin Scully Press Box at the LA Dodgers\u2019 stadium on Vin Scully Avenue waiting not for Vin Scully, known as baseball\u2019s greatest announcer, but for the Spanish language Vin Scully the voice of their lives. And when he emerges from the elevator, they embrace him and ask for photos and then they beg that he never, ever leaves.",
        "The Baltimore Ravens say former tight end Konrad Reuland has died at the age of 29 following a brain aneurysm. Coach John Harbaugh opened his news conference after Monday night\u2019s loss to the New England Patriots by announcing Reuland\u2019s death. Reuland was attempting to recover from a brain aneurysm he suffered last month. A Ravens spokesman says Reuland\u2019s mother informed the team that he died Monday. \u201cWe love Konrad Reuland,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cEvery single guy in that locker room loves him that knows him.",
        "Nelson Valdez found a perfect moment to snap his scoring drought. Valdez scored his first MLS goal in nearly a full year with an header to give the Seattle Sounders a victory over Sporting Kansas City on Thursday night, and send them into the Western Conference . With Seattle pressing for a winner in the closing minutes of regulation, Joevin Jones\u2019s cross found Valdez at the near post, and his header easily beat goalkeeper Tim Melia. \u201cIt\u2019s felt like there\u2019s been a big mountain on top of me all season.",
        "Barack Obama revealed his annual holiday reading list this week, at last solving the mystery of who is the one remaining person on earth who still hasn\u2019t read The Girl on the Train. Along with Paula Hawkins\u2019 novel, he is taking Helen Macdonald\u2019s memoir H Is for Hawk the Pulitzer book about surfing, Barbarian Days The Underground Railroad, a fictionalised history by Colson Whitehead and the novel Seveneves, to Martha\u2019s Vineyard. Obama\u2019s holiday picks are always guaranteed a sales boost, but he is not the first president to enjoy a good book."
