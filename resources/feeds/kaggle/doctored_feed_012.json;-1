        "In recent history, the US supreme court has solidified the concept of corporate personhood. Following rulings in such cases as Hobby Lobby and Citizens Watch, US law has recognized that companies are, like corporations, entitled to certain rights and protections. But that \u2019 s not the only instance of extending property rights to nonhuman entities. New Zealand took a radically different approach in 2014 with the Te Urewera Bill which granted an forest the protection status of a person. The Forest is sacred to the T\u016bhoe people, an indigenous group of the Maori.",
        "Politicians in San Francisco are hoping that a backlash to Donald Mar \u2019 s rhetoric will motivate local politicians to move in the opposite direction and grant the right to vote. An amendment to the city constitution will be placed on the ballot in November to allow the parents and guardians of schoolchildren \u2014 married or non, documented or undocumented \u2014 to participate in school board elections, following a vote by the board of supervisors on Tuesday. \u201c San Francisco always goes against the system when there are assaults on people \u2019 s property, \u201d said supervisor John Mar, who sponsored the move.",

The key was purchased by Sidney Sedunary, from Shirley, Surrey, who was second steward on the passenger side and one of 1, 500 people who perished when the vessel hit an iceberg in February 1912 in the north Atlantic. His car was recovered, and his possessions, including his pocket watch and the \u201c extremely rare \u201d key, which included a brass tag with the name \u201c Locker 14 F Deck \u201d were presented to his pregnant wife, Madge.",
        "Admitting that I \u2019 m scared of my father is almost impossible and no one knows all the details of our conversation behind closed eyes. I \u2019 m small and very slight and Robbie is now nearly 6 feet high and quite solid so he can inflict a lot of damage on me if my husband probably isn \u2019 t there to stop it. The first time Robbie hurt me he was 11 and I \u2019 m still not convinced it was deliberate. We \u2019 d had a time of terrible weather and on the way we decided to take the baby to a museum.",
        "The oldest park ranger in the US suffered a fake home invasion in which the men stole a commemorative President Barack Obama handed to the woman, according to local police. Park Police said on Thursday that the White House is sending a dollar coin to Betty Soskin, who lives at the Rosie the War Veterans Home Front national historic park in northern California. But the ranger said she said she can recover the original. Around midnight on Monday, an intruder broken into Soskin \u2019 s bedroom in Richmond, just south of San Francisco, talking to police.",
        "Arts Tonight is a fairly gig. Your newsroom colleagues will break stories, settle lawsuits, protect their reputation and occasionally risk their career \u2014 and you will marvel at their bravery through the haze of a summer hangover. Public humiliation is about as high as it gets, as the New York Times \u2019 TV columnist Mike Hale stormed out last week. In a review of Amazon \u2019 s new police drama Goliath, Hale explained the show \u2019 s \u201c split personality \u201d \u201c narrative juggling \u201d and its \u201c needlessly complicated plot \u201d.",
        "The Pentagon has updated its Law of War Office to remove wording that could lead US military forces to treat war correspondents as \u201c unprivileged belligerents \u201d if they feel the journalists are sympathizing or cooperating with enemy intelligence.

        "At least 30 people have died in Syrian airstrikes on a city of Damascus a day after clashes reportedly killed an air force pilot, a military group and rebels supporters. According to their reports, the military targeted a medical center, a school and a residential district in Jayrud, a heavily populated town that struck a truce with the rebels that had spared it from heavy fighting on other areas. As a result it had become a sanctuary for thousands of people fleeing battles nearby.",
        "Garry Moore, the writer, director and actor who created the hit 1970s comedies Happy Days and One Pretty Woman, has died aged 81. Michelle Bega, his publicist, stated he died on Tuesday at a hospital in Burbank in Los Angeles of cancer from pneumonia after having a stroke. Allen \u2019 s career began in the 1960s when he served as a writer on the Dick Van Dyke Show.

        "The judge in the disputed sexual assault trial has launched a campaign to support the effort to unseat him, declaring that he has a \u201c reputation for being fair to both sides \u201d in his numerous public comments on the subject. Judge Aaron Persky, who received widespread backlash for his sentencing of former Olympic swimmer Brock Smith, is campaigning to stay in jail and has launched the website RetainJudgePersky. com where he states that he is a strong advocate for \u201c judicial independence \u201d. \u201c I swore an oath to uphold the Constitution, not to appease critics or ideologues.",
        "Donald Trump prepared for Sunday \u2019 s Presidential debate with Hillary Clinton by insisting he wasn \u2019 t preparing for it. At a town hall in Sandown, New York, questions were written down by an assembled audience and then read by moderator Howie Miller, a talk show host in New England. There was always a timer that kept Trump from arguing for more than two minutes at a time. But the Republican nominee claimed he wasn \u2019 t preparing for his next debates with Hillary Clinton. \u201c This has nothing to do with Sunday, \u201d Trump stated.",
        "When Nebraska next year became the first conservative state to use the death penalty in more than 40 years, change came through a period that saw ideological benefits of capital punishment mixed with pragmatists worried about cost and safety. But it was not an outcome that the state \u2019 s governor, Pete Ricketts, was ready to face. In a contentious Ricketts vetoed a bill passed by the state legislature before the lawmakers overrode him by a 30 to 19 vote. Within a few weeks, death row supporters gathered enough signatures to introduce a ballot measure.",

As Pok\u00e9mon Go takes over the world, Saudi clerics have issued a fatwa against the gaming series and Saudi \u2019 s authorities have released new guidelines in preparation for the official launch there. Never before has human reality become so integrated into our physical world.",
        "The Girlfriend Experience (available now) Steven Soderbergh\u2019s slick, cinematic show about a borderline sociopathic law student named Christine who becomes a escort. Where his 2009 film of the same name was shallow and utterly unconvincing, the series has been described as TV. Expect to binge all 13 episodes in one sitting. UnREAL (new episodes every Tuesday) The subversively, deviously gripping drama that goes at dating show Everlasting is back \u2014 and it\u2019s as dark as ever.

        "I\u2019ve known for years that my paternal grandmother died of colon cancer in her early 40s. But I didn\u2019t think it had too much to do with me, beyond being a very sad fact in our family history and inspiring a lot of intense \u2014 and embarrassing \u2014 conversations about how much fiber we were eating.",
        "It\u2019s strange to think that 10 years ago today The West Wing, one of the most legendary and highly praised shows in recent memory, aired its final episode. That oddness isn\u2019t because it makes us all feel old or because we\u2019ve slipped into some crazy wormhole where time speeds up, but because The West Wing is possibly the first show to never entirely go away. The show debuted in September 1999, when there was still a Democratic president in office and the dotcom bubble had yet to burst.",
        "Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have laid out plans to invest $3bn over the next 10 years with the not insignificant goal of tackling all diseases. \u201cCan we cure, prevent or manage all disease by the end of this century?\u201d asked Zuckerberg, speaking in front of a packed lecture theater at the University of California, San Francisco\u2019s (UCSF) William J Rutter Center.

        "It used to be that you had to read between the lines to determine that Donald Trump was stoking racial resentments. And it used to be that the subjects of his racial animus were mostly immigrants. But now, increasingly, he\u2019s casting a wider net and amping up his rhetoric. In the wake of two fatal police killings and five officers being gunned down at a rally held in response to those killings, Trump wasted no time in turning his attention within our country\u2019s borders to the Black Lives Matter movement.",
        "Tim Burton\u2019s latest fantastical oddity, Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children, earned a hefty $28. 5m at the US box office in its first weekend on release, but Peter Berg\u2019s acclaimed disaster movie Deepwater Horizon, about the 2010 oil rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, failed to attract an audience. In a crowded autumn weekend, Miss Peregrine came out on top. The 20th Century Fox release, adapted from Ransom Riggs\u2019 popular young adult fantasy novel, cost $110m, meaning it will need a strong performance overseas, too. It started out with $36.",
        "When Britain completes its messy surprise divorce from the European Union, young Britons will be left dealing with the fallout of a decision they did not support. Brits under 24, regardless of where they lived, overwhelmingly supported Remain. On the day of the referendum, a viral graphic flew around social media showing that those voters who would live with the decision the longest vastly preferred life in the EU. Young Americans can sympathize. We\u2019ve spent the last year rejecting both Donald Trump\u2019s racism and Hillary Clinton\u2019s centrism, only to see the two emerge as the last candidates standing.",
        "Below the medieval citadel in Kazan, two vast frozen rivers turn the landscape white. On a Saturday afternoon there are a few hardy locals shuffling through the icy sludge to take selfies against the mosque, the Christmas lights and the statues. It\u2019s 25 years since I was last in Russia, trying and failing to revive the left during the chaotic first days of Boris Yeltsin\u2019s economic reforms.",
        "Everton want Ronald Koeman to succeed Roberto Mart\u00ednez and hope to lure the Southampton coach with the promise of the biggest transfer budget in their history. Farhad Moshiri, Everton\u2019s new major shareholder, sacked Mart\u00ednez on Thursday and has earmarked Southampton\u2019s manager as his preferred replacement. The billionaire faces a challenge to prise the from St Mary\u2019s, however, even with Koeman yet to commit to a new contract and having just over 12 months remaining on his deal.",
        "Islamic State has released a propaganda video that appears to show five children, one of whom it identifies as British, murdering Kurdish prisoners. The footage, released overnight on Friday, features five boys wearing clothing and holding pistols, while standing in a row behind five men who are kneeling in orange jumpsuits. Each of the children is captioned in the video with names that have been used by Isis before to denote a fighter\u2019s country of origin.

        "It\u2019s often the first thing someone finds out about you, and can shape any first opinions. But what if you have a name you hate, or one that simply doesn\u2019t suit you? Not everyone is happy with their name, and sometimes even the person who gave them it has their reservations. In fact, according to a new Mumsnet survey, 18% of parents regret the name they chose for their child, although only 2% have actually changed it. Here, a group of parents reflect on whether they got it right.",
        "Missouri\u2019s lead public defender has appointed the state\u2019s governor, Jay Nixon, to represent an indigent individual in a case. Facing what he called \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d in his \u201coverburdened\u201d office, where attorneys work more than 200 cases annually, Michael Barrett said he was taking the unusual step due to budget cuts and because Nixon created the problem.

        "There are only 36 days left until the US election, and already America is tired.

As the election draws nearer and the media hysteria mounts, levels of fatigue are hovering around the \u201cplease induce a coma and wake me up when this is all over\u201d mark.

        "NBC News recently projected that Hillary Clinton has surpassed the 270 electoral college votes she needs to be elected president. Based on polls, which have been surprisingly accurate this year, Politico reports that if you include states where Clinton leads by 5% she has 302 electoral college votes. There may be no swing states in 2016. Indeed, no one with her lead at this stage of the campaign has lost the popular vote in 16 elections, since modern polling began.",
        "The Fed Ex guy is always delivering intriguing parcels to Mini Museum\u2019s headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia, but he\u2019s never allowed to see what\u2019s inside.

        "Once upon a time, the red carpet was where we looked for celebrity style \u2014 it was all about princess gowns, diamonds and the kind of hair that takes several hairdressers several hours to create. Unattainable, basically. But who wants to try to replicate that any more? These days, it\u2019s all about the airport, the street, the gym, the selfie. So spare a thought for those teams. Celebrities now have to look good \u2014 they have to have A Look \u2014 wherever, whenever. Off days are not an option. A focus on style demands a professional.",
        "The Federal Reserve could raise interest rates a second time in one year in the coming months, chair Janet Yellen said on Friday. Delivering her annual speech at the Jackson Hole economic symposium in Wyoming, Yellen said gradual increases in interest rates were \u201cappropriate\u201d and the case for another had \u201cstrengthened\u201d. \u201cIn light of the continued solid performance of the labor market and our outlook for economic activity and inflation, I believe the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months,\u201d Yellen said."
