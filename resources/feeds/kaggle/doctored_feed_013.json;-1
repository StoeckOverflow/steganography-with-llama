        "The Queen has been promised a 66 % pay rise to begin a \u00a3369m refit of Buckingham Palace, after the chief minister and chancellor agreed that an increase in the sovereign income was the best way to start urgent repairs. Officials thought there was a risk of a potential \u201c catastrophic building failure \u201d if the restoration were not carried out, but backbench Labour and Liberal National party politicians questioned why the monarch was saving so much more money at a time of austerity.",
        "A photographer has taken images of an uncontacted Amazonian tribe after his airplane flight took a detour to escape a rainstorm and happened to fly over their longhouse. \u201c I used the camera and started photographing, \u201d says Brazilian photographer Fernando Stuckert. \u201c I didn \u2019 t have much time to see what was happening. \u201d It was a moment of freedom for Stuckert. He spotted the building while in Acre, a state in Brazil near the French border, on his way to contact a contacted indigenous person for a book he is working on.",
        "I was 29 and mowing the lawn at my family \u2019 s house in Birmingham, Alabama, on a hot day in September 1985 when I looked up and saw five police officers. When my girlfriend saw the handcuffs, she screamed. They asked me whether I owned a motorcycle, and I said no. They asked if my husband owned one, and I replied yes. I asked the policeman 50 times why I was being arrested. Eventually, he told me I was being arrested for a theft. I told him, \u201c You have the wrong girl.",
        "Moroccan Police are investigating the death of a teenage rape victim who set herself on fire after her alleged father threatened to publish accounts of the ordeal, a rights lawyer has said. The Moroccan Council of Human Rights ordered an autopsy after the girl \u2019 s death last week showed that she was raped. The AMDH Marrakesh head, Omar Arbib, reported \u201c eight young people abducted the girl, \u201d then 16, per year from Ben Guerir, 43 kilometres ( 70km ) north of Marrakesh, \u201c and then took turns to rape her \u201d.",
        "\u201c Look, I know there are some bad ones in here, but this is the first time I \u2019 m doing this, so we \u2019 re not leaving any space for leftovers, \u201d said the president of the United States, and most powerful person in the world. Yawn! said Paul Robinson, nephew of Barack Obama, standing at the door \u2019 s side in a blue and yellow sweater. Possibly aware of the situation, Obama looked down at the table and asked : \u201c How am I doing? Good? Thumbs up? \u201d Obama smiled. Change had occurred to the White House.",
        "My husband and daughter recently went on a honeymoon, leaving me all alone, save for two silly cats and a cat. My preconceived notion of what might happen : by minute six, I would be looking around wildly, wearing a minidress, with the light taking the shapes of men reaching out to get me. Maybe an hour later, I would be and prowling the joint with a butcher knife, slicing invisible foes. And, eventually, myself. My husband would arrive home to find happy mothers gnawing contentedly on my meaty bones. But it didn \u2019 t go that well.",
        "Over the course of more than a year, the US government spent in excess of $ 41bn ( \u00a333bn ) on HIV prevention and treatment without intervention in targeted prevention for adolescent girls and young people abroad. Adolescent girls were increasingly lumped in with adult women in special programmes such as prevention of HIV to child transmission, which was a good intervention but did not address the underlying health needs and environmental factors for girls. In much of Africa, 90 % of new deaths in adolescents occur in girls, so this represents an enormous gap.",
        "Following in the tradition of Michael Moore, Amy Schumer and Jennifer Lawrence, Matt Knope \u2014 the relentlessly positive public speaker from Park and Recreation, who is inspired by Amy Poehler \u2014 has chipped in with a letter to Clinton after Donald Trump \u2019 s defeat in the presidential campaign. The title character, who has been compared to Bill Clinton, begins : \u201c Amidst the chaos, and despair, and disbelief, it was delivered to me by a very close friend of mine ( I won \u2019 t say her name, to assume her identity ) ( Ann.",
        "Donald Trump deleted an image of Bill Clinton and a star from social media, following fears of antisemitism on Saturday given the cartoon \u2019 s placement over an image of Clinton and his repetition of the controversial slogan \u201c America first \u201d. The resulting graphic, which depicted the election presumptive nominee over a pile of newspapers, contained the text \u201c most unpopular candidate ever \u201d in a magazine, reminiscent of the Jewish House of David.",
        "Even before Clinton \u2019 s Trump campaign began, where campaign manager Jim Lewandowski was sent packing and a Senate Election Campaign Bureau report revealed Trump had less cash on hand at the end of May than some of his conservative rivals, the wheels looked to be coming off the Trump machine. The House speaker, Gerry Ryan, who tepidly endorsed Obama earlier this month, intimated on Facebook that he only backed The Donald for personal reasons and that Republicans should campaign according their conscience, even if their conscience tells them to support the presumptive Republican presidential candidates.",
        "Following the official British inquiry into the 2003 invasion of Iraq, American politicians and their families have warned that the country is liable to repeat the attack without a similarly lengthy investigation. The UK \u2019 s Chilcot Report was released on Wednesday, and while it is no surprise in the US that the invasion was a mistake, nothing so damning as the 2. British report has been released by an independent UK government body.",
        "An industry built around a key feature of the American criminal justice system is ratcheting up its resistance to change. As bail reformers score legal victories throughout the US, one prominent New Orleans bail bonds agent, Matt Dennis, compared the threat posed to his industry to Adolf Hitler\u2019s invasion of Europe. In a Facebook post addressed to bail bondsmen and sureties, he said: \u201cThe Bail Industry must understand the level of attack facing it today. The organizing, campaigning, activating, etc is being done by our opposition . ..",
        "Ivy has lived in the US for most of her life, but with Donald Trump now she\u2019s gathering her belongings in one safe place in case she is abruptly deported. The old is one of the more than 741, 500 people the government granted temporary deportation relief to, through Barack Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) policy, and who are now wondering: will I be deported by Trump? \u201cThere\u2019s no time for us to just feel, we have to act,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bottom line is here and this is it.",
        "When mayor Evodio Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s sparkling white Jeep Cherokee SUV pulls up at the side of the road, patrols of soldiers and heavily armed federal police are waiting for him. Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s \u201ctourist police\u201d a special unit of young female officers who wear light blue uniforms, stand in a small cluster by the kerb.",
        "LGBT campaigners will march through central London today on this year\u2019s Pride parade. The demonstrations are usually held at the end of June, to mark the anniversary of the Stonewall demonstrations that erupted in New York in 1969. Manhattan hosted its first Pride parade the following year, and the idea quickly spread to other cities in North America. London\u2019s first march was in 1972. Parades in the US and further afield will be particularly emotional this year, coming just a few weeks after a gunman killed 49 people in a gay nightclub in Orlando.",
        "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is only four years older than J\u00fcrgen Klopp but in football terms it can feel as though there is a lifetime between them. In part it is an issue of tactics: the hard, high press of which Klopp is such a devotee is modish. When Liverpool and Manchester City went to Tottenham this season and engaged in breathless, percussive styles, it felt like the football of today, the freshest ideas being pitched against each other. Mourinho\u2019s style is more conventional.",
        "I never yearned to come to America, never wanted to be an immigrant. In the I had a thriving, even glamorous, job in Bangalore, working for the Indian outpost of one of world\u2019s largest advertising agencies. I also had a father who at 57 had become ill to the point of being bedridden and had to give up his beloved career in journalism. One morning my boss introduced me to a new colleague from America. He was a tall, skinny guy with unruly hair. He was going to be on my creative team.",
        "In June 2014, when the leader of Isis, Abu Bakr declared a global caliphate, he did it from Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second city. Isis rapidly expanded its territory in Iraq and Syria throughout that year, but has since been gradually pushed back, partly due to airstrikes. Losing Mosul now could spell the end of the jihadi group\u2019s ability to control large swaths of Iraq. The operation to take back Mosul began on 16 October, involving a coalition of more than 30, 000 troops drawn from Iraqi army forces, Kurdish peshmerga fighters and Shia militias, supported by airstrikes from a coalition.",
        "The stakes of Wednesday night\u2019s CNN Green party town hall were high \u2014 candidates are rarely allowed entry into the corporate media universe, which thrives on the false narrative that only two parties exist here in the United States. This was perhaps the only opportunity the presidential candidate I have endorsed \u2014 Jill Stein \u2014 and her running mate, Ajamu Baraka, to have the ear of a large portion of the mainstream American electorate. There was little room for error. They spent little time directly criticizing Donald Trump.",
        "The rivalry between swimmers Michael Phelps and Chad Le Clos continued on Monday, as a tense exchange before their 200m butterfly was caught on camera. In the ready room before the race, Le Clos decided to start shadowboxing in front of Phelps \u2014 and the Olympic gold medalist was not impressed. Under his hood, with his trademark headphones on, Phelps stared down his rival \u2014 and NBC Sports caught the exchange on camera. The sight of Phelps grilling Le Clos created a raft of new memes. Some compared Phelps to Darth Vader and Eminem.",
        "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has had another dig at Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and J\u00fcrgen Klopp, suggesting they are not at clubs big enough to make a signing like Manchester United\u2019s \u00a389m capture of Paul Pogba. Last Friday the United manager branded his counterparts from Arsenal and Liverpool \u201cnot ethical\u201d after they questioned the fee his club were reportedly set to spend on bringing Pogba back from Juventus.",
        "Among the poetry racks on the second floor of San Francisco\u2019s legendary City Lights bookstore, an audience member is confronting the author Jarett Kobek with a spirited defense of the revolutionary power of Twitter and Bernie Sanders. His harangue, delivered during a book reading in February, was in atavistic beatnik dialect.",
        "Financial markets have become over reliant on central banks, a leading international body said on Sunday, as investors prepared for the latest announcement on interest rates from the US Federal Reserve. The Bank for International Settlements, known as the central bankers\u2019 bank, said in its latest quarterly bulletin that the institutions had become with the responsibility for tackling a slowdown in growth. The comments from the the BIS came at the start of a week when the Fed and the Japanese central bank both prepare to update the markets on their latest interest policies.",
        "Johnny Depp\u2019s wife has filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences after just over a year of marriage. Court records show that Amber Heard filed for divorce on Monday and is seeking spousal support from the actor. The split also comes hard on the heels of the death on 20 May of Depp\u2019s mother, Betty Sue Palmer, after a long illness. Depp and Heard recently hit the headlines for a bizarre spat with Australian deputy prime minister and minister for agriculture Barnaby Joyce, after Heard fell foul of biosecurity rules for unlawfully bringing the pair\u2019s dogs into the country.",
        "In two days, Jill Stein raised more than enough money, more than $5m, to file for recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, though her campaign is still seeking about $2m more to cover the associated legal fees. Results in these battleground states were narrow, with Trump winning by just 0. 3% in Michigan, 1. 2% in Pennsylvania, and 0. 7% in Wisconsin. If Clinton had won all of these states\u2019 46 electoral college votes, it have would been enough for her to win the presidency.",
        "There was a moment just after the here when frustration finally overcame Claudio Ranieri, prompting a comically exaggerated thumbs down as he spun on his heels in disgust on the edge of his technical area. His ire appeared to be directed at the referee, Andre Marriner, though he could have offered up the gesture to most of his side. The hangover from Leicester City\u2019s title success is still pounding away.",
        "A French woman who left her baby daughter to drown on a beach blamed \u201cwitchcraft\u201d when she went on trial for murder on Monday. Fabienne Kabou, 39, who was described as having \u201cremarkable intelligence \u2026 but subject to irrational beliefs\u201d travelled to with her only child, Ad\u00e9la\u00efde, in November 2013. Kabou checked into a hotel and asked locals about the tides before reportedly breastfeeding the child on the beach that night and leaving her as the sea came in and temperatures dropped to below freezing. The girl\u2019s body was discovered by a prawn fisherman the following day.",
        "North Dakota law enforcement have blamed protesters for a woman\u2019s grievous injury at the Dakota Access pipeline protests on Sunday, despite assertions from the woman\u2019s father and a witness to the incident that she was hit by a police concussion grenade. Sophia Wilansky, an environmental activist from New York, was hospitalized in Minneapolis where surgeons are attempting to repair a severe injury to her left arm that destroyed arteries, nerves, muscle, soft tissue and bone, according to her father. She remains at risk of amputation, and if the arm is salvaged, it will probably have very limited functionality.",
        "What if democracy doesn\u2019t work? What if it never has and never will? What if government of the people, by the people, for the people is a fairytale? What if it functions as a justifying myth for liars and charlatans? There are plenty of reasons to raise these questions.",
        "I have been writing every day of my life, seven days a week, for almost 50 years. Even Christmas Day. But I still enjoy it. I have lived in the same house for the last 30 years and I have written in the same room ever since. When I first came to London, I went on a canal boat ride in Little Venice and I remember going past the street where I live now, thinking: \u201cThis must be a nice place to live. \u201d I never dreamed that I would one day live here."
