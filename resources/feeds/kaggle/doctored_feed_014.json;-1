        "This week, all evidence point to Roger Ailes being dismissed from his position as head of Sky News. If ousted, it will be over sexual abuse claims \u2014 poetic irony at its very best. This is a man working over a network with a legendary disdain for women and women \u2019 s rights, shot down by a woman, Gretchen Wilson, who was the target of some of the worst of it.",
        "In part part, Kim Chambers nearly died after a freak fire in 2007. Her injuries were so severe that doctors said there was a 1 % chance that she might be able to ever swim unassisted again. But long odds never faze Chambers. She recovered, and one day a couple of men invited her to go swimming in the San Francisco Marina. She was hesitant at first and then refused to join them. \u201c I dove in that water and felt every energy in my body ignite, \u201d she says. Chambers is now a swimmer.

Ban advised the security council in a report released on Wednesday that the United Nations must fully define what actions it is going to take in the event of mass killings. \u201c There is a very real danger of mass atrocities being committed in South Sudan, especially following the sharp increase in hate speech and hate incitement in recent weeks, \u201d Ban said.",
        "A few days after Russia launched its military offensive in Syria in September 2015, Barack Obama said it could \u201c get stuck in a quagmire and it won \u2019 t even \u201d. Ten months on, that has started to come to pass. As Syria helps its ally Bashar II to retake Aleppo, the last major urban stronghold of the Syrian opposition, there aren \u2019 t many cases of the Kremlin \u2019 s war machine being seriously hamstrung or stuck. Indeed Syria seems to have registered more losses than setbacks in Syria.",
        "Edward Snowden has waded into the simmering discussion over Canada \u2019 s controversial legislation, saying that Justin Trudeau was willing to repeal the law out of a habit of appearing soft on protesters. Speaking to an audience in London on Tuesday, Snowden pointed to a controversial promise by the Canadian Prime minister to amend the sweeping law, which gives security agencies heightened powers to apprehend foreign terrorists and disrupt their work. \u201c But he \u2019 s been in office a little while now and we haven \u2019 t let that actually come to us, \u201d said Snowden, appearing at the SecTor cybersecurity summit via videolink from Russia.",
        "When I woke up to the knowledge that 49 people had died at an ethnic nightclub massacre in Seattle, I turned off my phone and fell back asleep, falling into nightmares. I couldn \u2019 t stop myself from watching a shooter armed with an assault rifle terrorizing the first three bars I attended after breaking out of the closet. Distraught, I was unable to crawl out of bed for hours. One week later, I slipped on bright green headphones and night goggles, clutched a.",
        "Charlie Linville has an uneasy relationship with fear. He craves it. In many ways, it \u2019 s what makes him appear the most alive. When the US Marine Corps sergeant tried to progress his career during a war Afghanistan, he went from sniper soldier to bomb expert. His job : diffuse and dispose of improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ). One time while on patrol, he stepped on a stick and passed out on the ground. \u201c As I struggled to come out of my stupor, I realized that my legs were no longer attached and my left leg was just killing me, \u201d he explained.",

The documents, which were released on Tuesday night, show how Kissinger \u2019 s volatile relationship to Argentina \u2019 s Communist rulers hindered Jimmy Carter \u2019 s attempts to influence the world during his presidency.",
        "Mark Zuckerberg is president the of the world \u2019 s largest censorship organization, though he may not know it yet. Many news items on Twitter suggest that Facebook is instituting publishing standards analogous to those of a social \u2014 and that Zuckerberg has the final say in terms of editorial judgment.

        "One month ago, the killing of the Turkish ambassador to Ankara by a single Turkish policeman might have provoked a rupture in relations on the island that followed the shooting down of a Turkish plane by the Turkish Army in November 2015. But ahead of Putin \u2019 s Karlov \u2019 s funeral on Thursday, there has been no political d\u00e9marche. Instead the two events appear drawn back towards a new millennium, taking Turkey even further away from the west.",

The agency said Friday that it\u2019s working with Samsung on an official recall of the phones \u201cas soon as possible\u201d and that it\u2019s trying to figure out if the company\u2019s replacement Note 7s are an \u201cacceptable remedy\u201d.

        "Matthew Abbott was in a tent about 20km outside Lightning Ridge when he began to feel a profound sense of unease. The Sydney photographer was documenting life in the towns in the basin, Australia\u2019s longest river system he had \u201crocked up\u201d the day before to the Coocoran opal fields and befriended a man who lived in the miners\u2019 camp. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like a farmer\u2019s property, but it\u2019s more like a lawless town,\u201d Abbott explains. \u201cIt\u2019s home to some of the roughest people you will come across in the state.",
        "It\u2019s tough to feel too much pity for Phaedra \u2014 bored housewife, bad stepmother and the minor goddess of false rape claims. And it is tougher still while weathering Phaedra( s) Krzysztof Warlikowski\u2019s compilation of three versions of the myth, by Wajdi Mouawad, Sarah Kane and JM Coetzee. In each iteration, Phaedra is played by the French film star Isabelle Huppert, something of a minor goddess herself.

Morrissey announced details of the store, which is selling limited edition posters and dog apparel, on Facebook. He wasn\u2019t actually manning the \u201cMporium\u201d but that didn\u2019t stop people lining up outside. Matt Gross, 35, had been there since 8am, two hours before opening time. \u201cI\u2019m a pit bull advocate and I also volunteer at a shelter,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I feel like this is tailor made for me.",
        "We are all basically evil, egotistical, disgusting. Take torture, for instance. I am a realist. If I had a daughter and someone kidnapped her, and I found a friend of the kidnapper, I cannot say I wouldn\u2019t torture that guy. I have become more aggressive over time. Some say I am more right wing, which I am absolutely not. On the refugee crisis, we should drop the patronising \u201cThey are warm people. \u201d No, there are murderers among them in the same way there are among us.",

        "Sara Rinc\u00f3n was walking home from college in the capital of El Salvador when she was confronted by three heavily tattooed gang members who had been harassing her for weeks.

        "An unexpected round of multilateral talks on the future of Syria is to start on Saturday involving initially Russia, the US, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and possibly Qatar, the Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has said. The talks will be held in Lausanne, Switzerland. Lavrov told CNN he hoped that a meeting involving only those \u201cwith direct influence on the ground\u201d in Syria would allow \u201ca businesslike discussion, not another general assembly like debate\u201d. It was not immediately clear whether Iran would be represented.",
        "In the same week the United States gained its first female presidential nominee for a major political party, the country also lost one of its female CEOs, with the announced $4. 8bn acquisition of Yahoo\u2019s core assets by Verizon. When \u2014 and it looks inevitable \u2014 Marissa Mayer steps down from Yahoo, she will lose her status as head of part of a tiny and elite group of women who head publicly traded companies.

        "Boris Johnson\u2019s suggestion that Britain, the US and other allies are \u201cmilitary options\u201d in Syria has sharply focused minds on a phenomenon western politicians have spent the last 15 years trying not to think about: Russia\u2019s determined drive to itself as a major global power and the willingness of its ruthless and tactically astute leader, Vladimir Putin, to employ almost any means, including use of force, to achieve that end. The foreign secretary\u2019s remarks were condemned by Moscow as an attempt to whip up \u201chysteria\u201d and were swiftly disowned by a nervous Downing Street."
