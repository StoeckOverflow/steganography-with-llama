        "To the lively beat of a salsa band, and with a water horn from airport fire station, the first commercial flights between the US and Cuba since 1961 took off from Florida on board, a symbolic next step in the new era of d\u00e9tente between the former cold war adversaries. Among the passengers aboard JetBlue Flight 387 from Fort Lauderdale to Santa Clara were many Cuban exiles returning to their homeland for the first time in years, and the chief transport secretary, Anthony Foxx, headed for talks with his government in Havana.",

        "These are the moments when the comedy goes back to one of the sketches that has formed part of Henning Wehn \u2019 s routine since the last World Cup. There are not many Germans on the comedy panel in England and Wehn used to have a share of the trophy to bring out on stage. Back home, he would explain, everyone had one. And then he would hold it towards his audience, teasing them, with a note to his voice that reminded us which nation coined the word schadenfreude. \u201c This, \u201d he said, \u201c is the closest you will ever get to it.",
        "To begin with, auditions taught me to get through everything. In the end, it was the other way around. I \u2019 m an actor. Since I was a kid I have had to play different parts, negotiating the cultural integration of a Pakistani family, rudeboy roles, and a scholarship to private school. The fluidity of my own personal identity on any given day was further compounded by the changing responsibilities assigned to Asians in general.",
        "Marvin Gaye seminal 1971 album What \u2019 s Going On is to be the beginning of a documentary. Centred around issues of poverty, police corruption, drug abuse and violence in the wake of Martin Luther King Jr \u2019 s assassination and with lyrics written from the memory of a Vietnam war veteran, the film will document the birth of a soul classic that \u201c allowed America and the world to lean on to inspire a generation of musicians and music lovers \u201d the producer told Variety. \u201c The story of [ his ] masterpiece \u2026 is as strong as ever.",
        "Islamic Front fighters appear to have reconquered the holy city of Palmyra after days of bloody fighting on its outskirts despite a withdrawal by the Syrian military. \u201c The catastrophe has happened, I am in absolute danger, \u201d said Maamoun Abdulkarim, Syria \u2019 s inspector of antiquities, in a phone interview. \u201c I am losing hope, it looks like we have lost the city. \u201d An Internet channel claimed victory in the battle on Sunday, saying its soldiers had reclaimed much of the entirety of Palmyra, once a Silk Road oasis that boasted some of the ruins of Damascus.",
        "Desperate residents in southern Aleppo spent another day under intense bombardment on Wednesday and their elation at a possible arms deal was replaced with dismay as attacks on rebel villages resumed and an evacuation process appeared to unravel in the face of fierce opposition.",
        "As a kid, my favorite costumes were Esmerelda, Jasmine or Pocahontas \u2014 or as I \u2019 ve described them : the Disney Princess Little Girl Club. I loved being excited about dressing up as these princesses because my interest in these costumes could well replicate a Disney Princess. It felt good to be included in the parade, to have a seat at the table, especially if the brown women at the table were a collection of slapdash caricatures created to complement merchandise.",
        "Meet Hugh Grant. No, not the famously known Four Weddings and a Funeral actor, but the even more controversial \u201c Scottish optimist \u201d who is chairman and chief executive of global agrochemical company Monsanto, AKA \u201c the most evil giant in the world \u201d. It \u2019 s a big win for Grant and Monsanto, a company that has been warned against adverse publicity following its production of deadly herbicide Orange Orange in the 1960s and, more recently, its placing at the forefront of genetically modified crops.",
        "Buenos Aires has announced plans to shut down its zoo, arguing that keeping wild animals in captivity and on display is degrading. Mayor Horacio Gonz\u00e1lez Larreta said that the zoo \u2019 s 2, 500 animals will be gradually moved to forest reserves in Argentina which can provide a more suitable environment. The area in the Palermo neighbourhood will become an ecopark when it is reopened later this month. \u201c This situation of captivity is degrading for the zoo, it \u2019 s not the way to take control of them, \u201d said Rodr\u00edguez, at a seminar on Thursday.",
        "Chelsea first goes before a disciplinary court of the US army on anyone charged with interfering with the \u201c good order \u201d of the military barracks in which she is held by attempting suicide, an offence that could lead to indefinite solitary confinement.

        "The lawyer representing the family of JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey, the child pageant queen whose death became a trend in the late 1990s, is threatening to sue CBS over a recent controversy about the case. The body of Ramsey, a winner of several prestigious beauty pageants, was found the night after Christmas 1996 in her family home in Boulder, Colorado, along with a ransom note.

        "There are elegant restaurants and erotic restaurants, establishments for business and restaurants for business \u2014 and one that was all of these things, more wonderful than any other.

The lawsuit, filed in June, argues the school expelled the popular press in February to prove it was based on sexual misconduct.",
        "Truman Capote is to have a final, macabre whirl of celebrity by having his ashes auctioned off in Los Angeles \u2014 starting price $2, 000. The remains, contained in a carved Japanese box, will go on the block in September, 32 years after Capote\u2019s death. Whether the author of In Cold Blood would appreciate his ashes being sold off in cold commerce is an open question, but the man flogging them has no doubt. \u201cWith some celebrities this wouldn\u2019t be tasteful, but I know 100% he would love it,\u201d Darren Julien, president of Julien\u2019s Auctions, told the Guardian.",
        "The final presidential debate, thankfully the last set piece in a wretched campaign, revealed what is admirable and loathsome in American politics. Hillary Clinton displayed a intelligence and a quick wit. Her facility with facts trumped Donald Trump\u2019s lack of them. Americans finally saw on Wednesday why Secretary Clinton had got rich from giving lectures after leaving office. Her fluency with words, which has earned her $22m in speaking fees, appeared to silence her opponent. Mr Trump, a boastful, billionaire who trades in racism and misogyny, was left squawking on the sidelines of the debate.",
        "Two documentary are facing decades in prison for recording US oil pipeline protests, with serious felony charges that first amendment advocates say are part of a growing number of attacks on freedom of the press.

        "Barack Obama\u2019s original cabinet was chockablock with historic firsts. The first African American attorney general. The first Nobel laureate upon appointment. The first female homeland security secretary, and the first African American to head the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet, if confirmed, also would advance multiple historic firsts. It would be the first cabinet of multiple billionaires. It would be the first cabinet to give pride of place to climate deniers. It would be the first cabinet whose members want to eliminate their own agencies.",
        "Dear Britain, I don\u2019t have much sympathy for the current European Union. Its upper floors are elegantly furnished, with spacious halls for parties and banquets there are abundant stores and provisions, rooms with panoramic views where building bylaws pertaining to those residing on the lower floors are discussed and drawn up, security services that design alarm systems and sturdy doors to keep out those who want to set up camp in the entrance hall or at least in the basement. It\u2019s an ugly Europe, this one.",

        "US defense secretary Ash Carter arrived in Baghdad on Sunday to meet American commanders and Iraqi leaders and to assess progress in the fight to retake the northern city of Mosul from Islamic State militants.

        "The first time I interview Mark Singer it\u2019s the Tuesday after the Republican national convention, which culminated with a Donald Trump speech Singer accurately describes as \u201cscripted insanity\u201d. Things feel pretty bleak. Trump\u2019s candidacy, says Singer, is \u201cthe most cynical and truly sad thing that\u2019s ever happened in my life in this country, and I\u2019ve lived through assassinations and terrible wars, but that it has led to this \u2014 it\u2019s a mixture of every awful emotion. If we elect this man it\u2019s the end of a lot of things, I just don\u2019t know how that happens.",
        "In autumn 2006, I\u2019d just returned from a year of travelling after getting a first in economics at the University of Birmingham. I was 21, living back with my parents near Southampton and two weeks into a graduate position at the accountancy firm, KPMG. The future could not have looked brighter. I went back to Birmingham to catch up with some friends. After a curry, we headed back to the student union for old times\u2019 sake. There had been an open day on campus so the fountain was on.",
        "The polls tighten. The fear rises. And there could hardly be a more urgent or relevant film than this. Five years ago, British director Anthony Baxter made a Michael documentary about the obnoxious arrogance of Donald J Trump, who was vandalising a coastline of natural beauty near Aberdeen to build a golf course, in so doing making promises on job creation and finding a useful idiot in Alex Salmond, who had rolled over with the necessary political permissions.",
        "The Australian composer and pianist Anthony Pateras doesn\u2019t get a chance to speak to renowned vocal prodigy and Faith No More frontman Mike Patton very often. Patton admits this makes him feel \u201cnervous and scared\u201d given the pair will be performing together, as duo, t\u0113t\u0113ma, in less than two months time in a show at the Mona Festival of Music and Art (Mona Foma) in Hobart, Australia.

        "A Nigel Farage resignation is for Christmas, but not for life. Even before the Ukip leader finished the event announcing he was stepping down, Nigel was already softening his stance so much it feels more prudent to cast this as a sabbatical. Think of it as Glenn Close going under the bathwater in Fatal Attraction. You know she\u2019s going to rear back up soon enough. Or, as Nigel put it about the possibility of returning as party leader in time for the 2020 general election: \u201cLet\u2019s see. Let\u2019s see where we are in two and a half years\u2019 time."
