        "Authorities say a Police officer in a small, north Georgia city has been shot and killed by a suspect who remains on the loose. Special Director Scott Whitley of the Georgia department of investigation told the Associated Press that Eastman Police officer Tim Johnson, 31, was fatally shot at about 9. 30pm Saturday in a populated area of the city about 60 minutes of Macon. \u201c Officer Johnson exited his patrol car to investigate and was shot by the police, \u201d the Georgia bureau of investigation said in a statement.",
        "For much of its second fortnight Euro 2016 felt like a party that, for completely understandable reason, the hosts did not much expect to hold. As though standing behind their guests with a dustpan and mirror, repeatedly checking the venue to see when it would be best to ask them to leave and keep the music down whenever appropriate, organisers have had the air of reluctant support. It was only with the final round of five games, two legs in, that there were signs this tournament is beginning to throw off its shackles.",
        "Hackers linked to the Russian government stole intelligence files on Donald Trump from the Democratic National Committee, according to a US company investigating the breach. Some of the hackers had been involved in the systems since at least last summer, well before Trump sealed the Presidential nomination, but only recently exfiltrated the Conservative party \u2019 s cache of information on Trump \u2019 s business life and past political history, investigators said. Third parties normally use such files for attack ads and leaking story information to journalists while spy agencies typically maintain dossiers on top leaders to better explain their thinking and habits.",
        "A monument for the anniversary of the sinking of a steam ferry recently appeared in Prospect Park at the southern tip of Manhattan, near other somber memorials to soldiers, sailors and mariners lost at battle or on the battlefield. There was, however, no such natural disaster. The artist behind the memorial, Joseph Reginella, built the whole thing up.",
        "The Lady Chablis, the female nightclub star from Savannah, Georgia, who successfully lobbied Clint Eastwood to play herself in his 1997 remake of the John Berendt novel Love in the Garden of Good and Evil, has reportedly passed away at the age of 59. Chablis, who told Entertainment Tonight in 1996 that she changed her screen name to reflect her married name ( including the \u201c The \u201d ) was a disco star who also performs publicly as a woman.",
        "Anyone with a good acquaintance with football in South and Central America knew it was coming. The Venezuela footballer Dani Hernandez refused to take a goal penalty during his side \u2019 s Copa America match against Mexico, and down came the chant from the terraces : \u201c Ehhhhhh, puto \u201d. The phrase roughly translates as \u201c fag \u201d and its homophobia is unedifying in any context. But on Friday night, the chant had added sting, coming just days after the terrible attack on the LGBT community in Orlando, where 49 teenagers were killed at a gay rally.",
        "This wasn \u2019 t how this postseason was supposed to go. For the past few seasons it has been an article of faith that the Western Conference would drop down to the San Antonio Spurs and the Golden State Warriors. Throughout the regular season, the two teams fought like they were playing on a completely different level then the rest of the league. That \u2019 s why it was downright jarring to see the fans thoroughly dismantle the Spurs Friday night in Game 6. With their loss, Oklahoma City got a trip to the Western Conference finals.",
        "China unveiled its Chengdu stealth fighter in public for the second time on Tuesday, surprising the country \u2019 s biggest producer of aircraft makers and enthusiasts with a show of its military clout. Super jets, Zhuhai \u2019 s headline feature, swept over dignitaries and hundreds of sports and industry executives appeared at the show \u2019 s opening table in a flypast, generating a deafening roar that was accompanied with gasps and applause and setting off car alarms in a car accident at the site.",
        "The birth of Willy Wonka predated Gene Wilder \u2019 s embodiment of him by fifty years. Dahl \u2019 s book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory originally appeared in 1964 Mel Gibson \u2019 s retitled adaptation came in 1971. But with Billy \u2019 s passing last week, the world also mourned the demise of the man synonymous with that of the mercurial black man. Widely seen and universally felt, Wilder \u2019 s interpretation of the man behind the world \u2019 s strangest chocolate factory resonated with millions everywhere \u2014 but also in the hearts and minds of inchoate pastry chefs who were inspired by the perfect teacup and everlasting gobstopper.",
        "Paul Pogba will leave Manchester United only if his first choice of Real midfielder proves impossible, with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho \u2019 s hopes of securing the attacking midfielder resting on outbidding the Portuguese club and meeting the club \u2019 s wage demand of \u20ac300, 000 ( \u00a3250, 000 ) a week. United and Real both nominate Pogba, though Juventus do not wish to lose the Frenchman, who scored in his club \u2019 s Euro 2016 defeat of Sweden on Sunday. This means the player would have to match Liverpool \u2019 s minimum \u20ac100m ( \u00a384m ) valuation in the first leg, and there would then be a bidding war.",
        "A Tenessee mother and founding member of a parents \u2019 association opposed to Islamic \u201c indoctrination \u201d has advocated for a history textbook to be dropped from her daughter \u2019 s social science curriculum, claiming that it \u201c promotes Islamic propaganda \u201d. Mary Edmisten, a founder of the Facebook collective Sullivan County Council Against Islam Indoctrination, first faced the issue in October, after her daughter was given an assignment requiring her to answer questions about the teachings of Islam \u2019 s holy teachings, and the five pillars of Islam.",
        "When I ask if I can find you at this particular cafe or that little restaurant, I am only trying to be sure I \u2019 m not posing a question. It is an honour to go to a place I have meticulously documented and probably visited before. Spontaneity is a term that will never be associated with my condition. I consider myself \u201c recovered \u201d but I do not use the term. I suffered from a mental illness for about four years, gripped in a stranglehold of control, power and numbers. I am now at a point where I understand my disease.",
        "Canada\u2019s attempt to act on climate change is being undermined by $3. 3bn in government subsidies flowing to oil and gas producers in the country a year, a new report has warned. The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has vowed to place a national price on carbon dioxide emissions by 2018. Last week, Trudeau said he would not be deterred by the election as US president of Donald Trump, who has called climate change a \u201choax\u201d and would forge ahead with the plan to \u201cshow leadership that quite frankly the entire world is looking for\u201d.",
        "On Friday, near Palmyra, 14 tanks and an system were destroyed in an air strike on Isis. Palmyra recently fell to the jihadists after the Syrian regime and its allies diverted forces to Aleppo, leaving the ancient city . This was a repeat of events last year when, on the advice of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, the regime deployed troops away from Palmyra to the strategically significant metropolis of Aleppo. The planes struck Palmyra on the same day Suleimani was photographed treading the city\u2019s rubble. But the planes weren\u2019t Russian or Syrian: they belonged to the international coalition.",
        "And so, after all the delays and rumours and teasers and the live streams, Frank Ocean\u2019s new album is finally here! What, I hear you ask, is Boys Don\u2019t Cry actually like? Erm, we don\u2019t really know. Because Frank Ocean being Frank Ocean, the album he has put out isn\u2019t Boys Don\u2019t Cry. At least we don\u2019t think it is. Instead it\u2019s billed as a \u201cvisual album\u201d called Endless. Apparently, it is one big teaser \u2014 the teaser to end all teasers, if you will \u2014 before the real thing, with a title, arrives this weekend.",
        "Like many digital (are we digital tourists? Immigrants? Reluctant asylum seekers?) I like to assume that social media trends I don\u2019t understand can\u2019t be that important, otherwise I would somehow, maybe telepathically, understand them. So it was with the around a person\u2019s name on Twitter. On my timeline, which is roughly divided between foodies and lefties, people started to themselves \u2014 (((like this))) \u2014 but this is a response to and subversion of the main trend, which is to others.",
        "I am a Pakistani medical doctor, currently receiving political asylum in the US for the past year and a half. I sought refuge here after having to go through much humiliation and outright hatred for trying to practice ethical medicine and for belonging to a religious minority in my own motherland. A while back, my father retired from a reputed local bank in Pakistan and moved to the US, along with the rest of my family. I continued to live in Pakistan: I was a fresh medical graduate pursuing the dream of education in nephrology.",
        "Mission accomplished by France, who blended slickness and jitters throughout but were uplifted at the last by Payet, their best player on the night and the scorer of a superb winning goal. That\u2019s a nice start for the hosts to build on, even if plenty of improvement will be needed for them to win here on July 10. 90+3 min: Matuidi releases Sissoko. He could announce his arrival in stye here . .. but instead blasts a shot wide. France substitution: Payet ambles off to tumultuous acclaim and sudden national hero status. His replacements wanders on.",
        "There\u2019s always a narrative. This year, it\u2019s that 2016 saw a massive surge for the reactionary . The world, we are told, has suddenly become very suspicious of itself: millions gnaw their way down into the soil to blot out everything around them. Reaction and nativism are on the rise everywhere. There was Brexit, there was Trump. Salafists left bodies and wreckage across the Mediterranean from Syria to the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur. There were the petty of French mayors ordering Muslim women to strip off at the beach.",
        "It\u2019s been a year since the Cereal Killer cafe in London\u2019s Brick Lane became the focus of an riot, and its owners received letters saying \u201cdie hipsters\u201d. To be fair, not everyone was hostile to the cafe: the morning after the riot in which protesters daubed the word \u201cscum\u201d on the shop window, there were queues of customers paying up to \u00a34. 50 for a bowl of cereal. So how will Birmingham react when a branch of the cafe opens at Link Street in the Bullring next month? With greater sangfroid than excitable Londoners, is my guess.",
        "The mass collection of telephone records by government surveillance programs poses a clear threat to the personal privacy of ordinary citizens, according to US researchers who used basic phone logs to identify people and uncover confidential information about their lives. Armed with anonymous \u201cmetadata\u201d on people\u2019s calls and texts, but not the contents of the communications, two scientists at Stanford University worked out individuals\u2019 names, where they lived and the names of their partners. But that was not all. The same data led them to uncover potentially sensitive information about some individuals.",
        "North Dakota police arrested more than 120 people over the weekend at Native American oil pipeline protests, including and journalists, prompting accusations that law enforcement officials are stifling free speech and using excessive force against peaceful protesters. There were increasingly tense clashes between police and demonstrators against the Dakota access pipeline, which the Standing Rock Sioux tribe says is a threat to its water supply and cultural heritage.",
        "Fifteen days before the Olympics opening ceremony, Brazilian police have arrested 10 alleged Islamic State sympathisers who are suspected of planning an act of terrorism during the games. Two others are still at large. The Brazilian justice minister, Alexandre Moraes, described the suspects \u2014 all of whom are Brazilian \u2014 as \u201cabsolutely amateur and unprepared\u201d but he said they had sworn allegiance to Islamic State, celebrated the recent attacks in Orlando and Nice, and some of them had tried to buy .",
        "As Donald Trump\u2019s own advisers said this week that Trump would use Richard Nixon\u2019s famous \u201claw and order\u201d rhetoric during his 1968 campaign as his inspiration for his Republican nomination speech on Thursday, many have begun comparing Trump to the disgraced former president. The parallels with a man who presided over another era in which there were widespread allegations of police brutality and killings of unarmed African Americans seem compelling. But if you take a detailed look back at Nixon\u2019s 1968 campaign for president, the analogy runs much deeper than his language attacking racial minorities.",
        "Microsoft might pay the NFL $400m to use its tablets, but that doesn\u2019t stop players, coaches and announcers from complaining about the devices. Last week, the New England Patriots\u2019 head coach, Bill Belichick, went on a minute rant about the Surface Pro, saying he was going back to using pen and paper. He said: \u201cAs you probably noticed, I\u2019m done with the tablets. I\u2019ve given them as much time as I can give them. They\u2019re just too undependable for me.",
        "In recent years Latin America has had more female presidents than any other part of the world. Yet none of these women during their triumphant electoral campaigns had to face as biased and derogatory propaganda, as close a scrutiny, as Hillary Clinton in her attempt to become the first woman to be president of the US.",
        "Hillary Clinton has expressed regret over her controversial statement that half of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters belonged in a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d. Clinton made the remark when speaking at a gala event for the group LGBT for Hillary in New York City on Friday night, saying: \u201cYou know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump\u2019s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? \u201cThe racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic \u2014 you name it. And unfortunately, there are people like that. And he has lifted them up.",
        "A South Carolina man killed at least seven people in a hidden crime spree that lasted more than a decade and only was uncovered when police rescued a woman chained at the neck in a storage container, authorities said. Todd Kohlhepp accepted responsibility for an unsolved massacre in which four people were killed, one day before the 13th anniversary of the deaths that stumped authorities, said Sheriff Chuck Wright, who was first elected a year after the murders. On Sunday, relatives of those killed in the massacre gathered in a Spartanburg courtroom.",
        "Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton\u2019s health has been under scrutiny in recent weeks, not by medical professionals but by politicians and supposed pundits playing doctor on TV. Clinton\u2019s personal physician, Dr Lisa Bardack, has repeatedly said: \u201cSecretary Clinton is in excellent health and fit to serve as president of the United States. \u201d Meanwhile, conspiracy theories about Clinton\u2019s supposed ill health have gone viral. There\u2019s no evidence these claims are true. I\u2019m a doctor. I don\u2019t play at being a doctor.",
        "Who killed Grantland? It\u2019s a question that sustained a new and seemingly inexhaustible of sports media in past year, and was the source of much conjecture and conspiracy theory among hardcore fans of ESPN\u2019s late, sport and pop culture website when it was shuttered by its financiers in September 2015. The way former Grantlander Bryan Curtis tells it, it was a pretty simple equation: one day the site\u2019s founder and most popular writer Bill Simmons was an employee of ESPN, the next day he wasn\u2019t."
