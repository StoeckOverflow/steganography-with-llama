        "Wells Fargo will eliminate sales control for all of its retail banking services by January, the bank leaves on Tuesday. The decision came less than a week after the large US bank announced a deal with regulators and agreed to pay $ 185m in penalties for its illegal sales practices. More than 5, 000 employees were removed by Wells Fargo after an employee revealed that they were opening credit and credit card companies without permission from its directors in order to meet certain quotas enforced by the bank.

        "Early Friday morning last week, I felt the thud of my mother Tink \u2019 s paws as she landed on my legs. I was sound asleep and she woke me up, which had never happened before. It was completely uncharacteristic : she sleeps quietly and never comes into the bathroom. I sat up feeling groggy because I \u2019 d been out the night before, but I soon realised something was very wrong. The room was with a trail of white smoke, dark and alarming, hanging in the air about two feet deep along a bank of white clouds.",
        "Rashaan Salaam, who won the 1994 Heisman Trophy at the University of Colorado before a NFL draft, has been found dead in a car park aged 42.

A report from the county sheriff \u2019 s office indicated there was no indication of foul play, while the Colorado Daily Camera suggested that Salaam \u2019 s death is suspected to be a suicide after police found a corpse.",
        "As the filming of protesters killing unarmed African Americans has led to a variety of protests and calls for change across the US, another aspect of the controversy has received little attention : the killing, harassment, and arrest of many of those who recorded and publicized the killings in the first place. Today, representatives of and nominated documentary \u2014 journalists Laura Poitras, Alex Gibney and two others \u2014 published an open letter calling on their friends to defend these brave female journalists and activists who are now becoming targets of the police themselves.",

        "The artist Yazmany Arboleda is visiting the city of Nairobi yellow \u2014 or at least its houses of worship. As part of his public works project Colour in Africa, religious buildings from schools to churches are being washed in bright yellow as a symbol of love among all religions. \u201c The plan was to take houses of prayer in Kenya and paint them black in the name of love, \u201d explains Arboleda from his studio in New York City. \u201c The idea from the show was to turn buildings into buildings that speak to our shared love. \u201d But yellow?",
        "I may write in women \u2019 s reproductive health and LGBT equality and security checks for gun permits, but I also took brief naps each Thanksgiving under the watchful glass eye of my cousin \u2019 s prized deer head mount. And I may now live in the journalism world, but I spent my formative summers wandering around my Illinois hometown \u2019 s \u201c Bagelfest \u201d an homage to one of our community \u2019 s chemical factories and its heritage.

The family \u2019 s lawyer, Justin Bamberg, said the book maintains that Scott left a book in his hands and that he did not own a car. Police shot Scott, a black man, in April, but days later the video has not been released because of a pending ruling that will require a court ruling to release such videos. It will take effect in October.",
        "The players from Chapecoense were prepared for a match that would hopefully mark the pinnacle of their club \u2019 s future so far : the first game of the final in South America \u2019 s Copa Sudamericana \u2014 the continent \u2019 s third most prominent club ever. It was the first time they had made it this far, and was the highlight of a fairytale series, which had already earned them praise with Leicester City \u2019 s dramatic rise to the top of the Northern Premier League later in the year. But instead, the match ended in tragedy.",
        "It may seem too early to call, but we might have a winner in the 2016 election. He \u2019 s like the pundits wrote off long ago. An improbable outsider who rode an insurgent bus to snatch the nomination from the establishment. An elite politician whose raucous laughter underscored his appeal to voters living outside his party lines. His name is Barack Obama. And he can thank the freak show that is Donald Trump \u2019 s political party for restoring his reputation as a unifying, national leader with a moderated and balanced approach to a complex and complex world.",
        "Practice may not make perfect for Donald Trump but the Republican nominee has clearly refined his appeal to evangelical voters in the past year. One year after Trump was booed at the conservative Values Voters Summit for calling Marco Rubio \u201ca clown\u201d the Republican nominee gave a more polished speech where he ignored politically divisive issues like abortion and marriage and instead focused on school vouchers and changing federal law to allow tax exempt churches to engage in political advocacy. For Trump, school choice, which he advocated in a speech on Thursday, was a needed innovation.",

One of 44, 795 villages in the state of Rajasthan, Chandauli is only three or four hours\u2019 drive from Delhi, but it exists alone and forgotten, tucked away, a kilometre off a quiet highway.

Since the vote, a flurry of articles have addressed the effects of Brexit on globalization, on the US economy, and on our national security.",

        "I was 41 when I attended trade school in 2015. Having worked seasonal positions in hospitality across multiple states over several years, I found a small town I enjoyed and sought stability. I had $5, 000 in credit card debt at the time. School was five days a week, eight hours a day. My seasonal position was reduced to weekends. Claiming partial unemployment allowed me to support myself, and federal loans covered tuition. Attending school and working weekend shifts, my education was suffering. I resigned from my position so I could focus on school, informing unemployment of this change.",
        "People read highlights from their childhood diaries in front of a crowd of strangers. Wonderfully cringeworthy. Episode of the year: The Summer Camp Spectacular, largely for the line: \u201cDear Mum and Dad, I cut my penis when I flunked my canoe test \u2026 \u201d Rowan Slaney, Stories about friendship, love and the messy beauty of our lives.

        "Despite Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric, talk of banning Muslims from America, and open hostility towards Syrian refugees, he has some supporters in the Middle East. Authoritarian governments see him as a strongman figure who will make deals with other strongmen like themselves. Some of the Gulf elites hope that, as a Republican, he will be harder on Iran than Barack Obama. Trump called the deal struck by Obama on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme a \u201cdisaster\u201d and \u201cthe worst deal ever negotiated\u201d.",

Nominated by Ronald Reagan for an appointment as a district judge in 1986, the former US attorney was rejected by the Senate judiciary committee, for allegedly having made racist remarks to colleagues.

        "Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards pleaded for aid for his state on Sunday, saying that after a week of devastating flooding, \u201cwe really need help. \u201d Unlike a hurricane, Edwards told CNN on Sunday, \u201cthis rain event didn\u2019t have a name, so we have folks around the country who I think are just now realizing how significant it was. \u201d Days of extraordinary rainfall caused severe flooding around southern Louisiana this week, killing at least 13 people, damaging an estimated 60, 000 homes and forcing thousands to the shelter of evacuation centers.",
