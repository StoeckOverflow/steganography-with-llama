        "The first song typically listed in a movie \u2019 s closing credits is that of the cast. Nine Lives avoided that custom. Instead, that title goes to the film \u2019 s famous cat trainers. Yeah, it \u2019 s a nice gesture. But let \u2019 s face it \u2014 the choice is rather drolly telling. Cynics will scoff that its director Paul Sonnenfeld probably wants his name expunged from the project, which he very well understands. In a year that \u2019 s already sent us turkeys like Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice, Warcraft and Suicide Squad, Nine Lives ranks as the most spectacularly inept studio offering films.",
        "A single day of fighting in June 1859, near the vineyards and villages near Lake Garda, left 40, 000 Italians, French and Austrian soldiers dead or wounded. The battle of Solferino might have been remembered simply for its carnage, but for the presence of Henry Dunant. Dunant, a Swiss traveller, spent days tending the hospitals and wrote a memoir that relates to the founding of the Red Cross and to the first Geneva Agreement, signed by Europe \u2019 s great powers in 1864. Solferino inspired the assertion that hospitals and army hospital personnel are not a legitimate interest in war.",

        "The ship of British polar explorer Sir John Franklin, HMS Terror, has been found in pristine conditions at the bottom of an Arctic harbour, researchers have said, in a case that challenges the accepted belief behind one of modern exploration \u2019 s deepest discoveries.

        "There are very few Hollywood who could have made Dunkirk. The cinemagoing public is not crying out for an epic war movie about the desperate evacuation of German troops at the peak of Britain \u2019 s hold on Europe in May and June 1940. But Christopher Knight doesn \u2019 t make turkeys : this is the director of the Christopher Knight trilogy, of Operation Inception, and of the equally far out space adventure Interstellar.

        "As a writing instructor at Boston University I can also detect plagiarism. When you read somebody \u2019 s writing week after week, sometimes all it takes is a really elegant turn of events or a sophisticated syntactical structure to wave a red flag. Most students know about the perils of plagiarism by the time they get to college. Others may not. They ask legitimate questions, such as : \u201c If made her point so clearly, why should I put it in my own words? \u201d And the answer, of course, is that you don \u2019 t have to.",
        "Please don\u2019t call it . The remake of is the 2016 blockbuster season\u2019s biggest disappointment, with losses projected to reach $120m.

According to the Hollywood Reporter, Vikander has been approached by Sony to play the celebrated crime author in her formative years as a \u201c \u201d unhappy with traditional expectations.

Put simply, Italy\u2019s economy is floundering and has been for the past two decades during which time there has been virtually no growth and Italian goods have become less and less competitive in export markets.

Normally he has been the sidekick to MVP Steph Curry, but with Curry struggling for much of the Western Conference finals, it was Thompson who came though on Saturday, hitting an NBA playoffs record 11 in the Warriors victory over Oklahoma City in Game 6. \u201cNobody wanted to [go home],\u201d Thompson said after the game, his 41 points having silenced a roaring crowd in Oklahoma City\u2019s Chesapeake Arena.",
        "The World Health Organisation has cleared coffee of causing cancer, but a detailed investigation has found that very hot drinks may be linked to cancer of the oesophagus, or gullet. Coffee was classified as a possible cause of cancer in 1991, but the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) which is part of WHO, has now reconsidered the evidence.

        "Iraq\u2019s parliament has passed a law forbidding the import, production or selling of alcoholic beverages in a surprise move that angered many in the country\u2019s Christian community who rely on the business. The law, passed late on Saturday night, imposes a fine of up to 25m Iraqi dinars (\u00a317, 000) for anyone violating the ban. But it\u2019s unclear how strictly the law would be enforced, and it could be struck down by the supreme court.

        "Coinciding with Mary Shelley\u2019s birthday week, this Scott family affair \u2014 produced by Ridley for director son Luke \u2014 is another runout for the old story about scientists who create new life only to see it lurch bloodily away from them. Frosty risk assessor Kate Mara\u2019s investigations into the mishandling of the eponymous hybrid intelligence (The Witch\u2019s Anya ) permits Scott Jr a good hour of existential unease: is it the placid Morgan or her intemperate human overseers (Toby Jones, Michelle Yeoh, Paul Giamatti) who pose the greater threat to this shadowy corporation\u2019s safe operation?",
        "If you\u2019ve ever wondered how to make half a billion dollars out of a woman, then this is how it works. First, take a book that gives life and shape to something millions of young women felt but couldn\u2019t quite put into words. Second, turn it into a film whose lead actress will be asked over and over again about her weight for a decade, thus neatly illustrating why your lead character counts calories obsessively. Third, dull the genuinely acerbic edge of the novels, and defy all attempts to make this female Peter Pan grow up.",
        "Paul Doyle Riyad Mahrez. Dominic Fifield You could take your pick from Jamie Vardy, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 or Riyad Mahrez at Leicester but Mahrez gets my vote on the basis he offered invention and creation as well as goals from wide. It is astonishing to think he cost only a fee when plucked from Le Havre in 2014. Owen Gibson Take your pick from any of those who worked miracles at the King Power but Kant\u00e9 was the choice of those very players for good reason.",

        "As anyone who has been to a Rolling Stones concert in the past 26 years will tell you, there is a moment where Mick Jagger, for all his grandiose stage swagger, is briefly, but undeniably, upstaged. As the opening chords of Gimme Shelter begin, Lisa Fischer steps out from behind the backing microphones and roars, in vocals that can fill any stadium, some of the most famous lyrics in pop music: \u201cRape, muuuurder It\u2019s just a shot away It\u2019s just a shot away.",

When the parents asked the Los Angeles property managers for help reading the notices, they were told: \u201cLearn English. \u201d According to a federal discrimination lawsuit filed Thursday against a major California real estate investment firm, when four mothers inquired about the notices, management threatened to \u201ccall immigration, social services and the police\u201d. \u201cI was in shock,\u201d said Carmen Castro, one of the mothers. \u201cThat really created a fear in us."
