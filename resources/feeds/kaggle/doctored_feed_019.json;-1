        "One of the central points of Monday evening \u2019 s blockbuster debate was Donald Trump \u2019 s nose. He repeatedly sniffled ( and spat water ) which seemed surprisingly rich given his condition that Hillary Clinton lacked stamina. Was he ill? The candidate commented on Fox News the next day : \u201c No sniffles, no. You know, the mic was very low. Maybe it was good enough to hear breathing. There was no sniffles. I have no allergies.

The security and political balance in Mosul will be the likely seed that could enable an Isis regeneration. Given the government in Iraq enters a situation in which local Sunnis fill the void, a new reality is almost certain.",
