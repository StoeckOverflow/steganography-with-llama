        "In Oakland \u2019 s Chinatown district, a diverse band of insurgents relieve workers of goods and light storefronts ablaze. Newly armed with fancy clothes, a handful of workers evade marauding riot troops. Nearby, freed prisoners and neighboring citizens barricade the gate surrounding an occupied area. The military is expected to attack in just a few days to decisively crush the rebellion. This is one of the scenarios that plays out on the board of Bloc by Bloc, a cooperative tabletop strategy game that pits players against the enemies in a struggle to liberate the city.",
        "More than a fifth of US pros know a current professional who has used drugs, and a quarter of players have suspected an opponent of throwing a match, according to an anonymous poll conducted by ESPN before the French Open. The sample was small, consisting of only 31 players from the WTA and ATP tours, but the results were reliable, and suggest current top players are aware of their opponents breaking the rules.",
        "Hillary Clinton \u2019 s presidential campaign announced on Saturday it would cooperate with efforts to secure ballots in several states, even as the White House declared the declared results as \u201c the will of the American people \u201d. The campaign \u2019 s general counsel, Marc Johnson, said in an online statement that while it had found no evidence of cheating, the campaign felt \u201c an threat to the more than 64 million Americans who cast ballots for Hillary Clinton \u201d.",
        "France \u2019 s first administrative court upheld a ban on the burkini in a test market in the southern town of Marseille, yet the majority of mayors who protested the ban are refusing to take the restrictions despite the opposition. Lawyers argued that the ban was spreading public fear and infringing on democratic freedoms, but resistance from more than 20 mayors has left people in a dilemma about how to react. Aheda Zanetti, the garment \u2019 s spokesman, says it isn \u2019 t something to be mistaken for oppression or a symbol of shame.",
        "In the sweltering heat of a fall day, I walked along the visitor trails of Yosemite National park. I had just made the walk from my childhood home in Los Angeles to glimpse a picture of the future. There in the valley framed by high towers of glass, I watched as thousands of people from all over the world marvelled at the sheer red walls of El Capitan, North Column and Half Dome.",
        "For Gareth Southgate it was the sort of result that should make everything official and dissuade the Football Association from expanding its search for a place. England had won convincingly and, though it might need a few more results of this magnitude before they are forgiven for the ordeal of Euro 2016, there was at last the sense of a team looking forward, with a little more optimism than before. Manchester, once again, felt like a good place.",
        "In the last seconds of the election, Hillary Clinton emerged the way she hoped she would, as the first female president of the United States. By refusing to pledge that he would accept the results of the referendum, Donald Trump nominated himself for the position of president. The democratic transfer of power after a special election has been the pillar of our election. By refusing to accept the results of the vote, Trump could be flouting the tradition of American socialism and the democratic beliefs of virtually all voters.",
        "A few years ago, a young man named Kyle Behm took a leave from his studies at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. He was suffering from bipolar disorder and needed treatment to get treatment. A month and a half later, Kyle was healthy enough to go to his studies at a different college. Around that time, he learned from a friend about a job. It was just a day at a Kroger supermarket, but it seemed like a sure thing. His boss, who was leaving the job, might vouch for him.",
        "Police in Los Angeles are investigating the vandalism of art galleries in a Latino area, including the message \u201c fuck white art \u201d as racial hate crimes. Three galleries were targeted every month amid public concern in Boyle Park that an influx of galleries heralds gentrification. A coalition of community leaders and leftwing supporters has mobilised over the past year to arrest, confront and in some cases intimidate galleries whom they fear will pave the way for activism that will push out residents and create a cradle of Chicano identity.",
        "Donald Trump was put on trial in his room during the debate as his running mate Mike Pence was accused of attempting to defend the indefensible. But Democrat Tim Kaine, embracing his role as Hillary Clinton \u2019 s attack dog, fought so aggressively that many viewers felt he lost the emphasis on style to the calm, collected and measured Republican outgoing governor. In a focus poll conducted by strategist Frank Luntz for ABC News in the swing states of Ohio, 22 people agreed that Pence won and only four said state senator Kaine prevailed.",
        "This was to have been the match that ended Lionel Messi \u2019 s legacy. The goal that silenced the doubters, that killed off the question mark hanging over his greatness, that gave him his place in the pantheon next to Diego Maradona and proved he could achieve the same feat with Argentina that has become so staggeringly rare at club level. Instead, it became The Night Messi Missed. Goalless after 120 seconds, a game that during the first period looked on course to be settled by officiating instead had to be settled by umpire.",
        "They call it \u201c Bull City, \u201d though, with the exception of a downtown statue, there are no bulls and there \u2019 s no hint that there ever were. The nickname derives from the old tobacco company \u201c Bull Durham, \u201d which was named after the bull on the label of Colman \u2019 s mustard, still manufactured in Durham, Pennsylvania, but it turns out that its factory is in Kentucky. There \u2019 s a lot of that in Durham : areas where myth and reality invade the street to avoid an intense conversation.",
        "A UN transport convoy delivering medical relief to a area around Aleppo was targeted in an airstrike, as a ceasefire brokered by Moscow and the US collapsed with a large surge of Syrian government bombing. The US stated it blamed Russia for the attack on the convoy, whether or not US planes were involved, since Moscow was responsible under the ceasefire agreement for reining in Bashar \u2019 s government forces.",
        "Scientists have created an \u201catlas of the brain\u201d that reveals how the meanings of words are arranged across different regions of the organ. Like a colourful quilt laid over the cortex, the atlas displays in rainbow hues how individual words and the concepts they convey can be grouped together in clumps of white matter. \u201cOur goal was to build a giant atlas that shows how one specific aspect of language is represented in the brain, in this case semantics, or the meanings of words,\u201d said Jack Gallant, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve got a handful of songs to sing To sting your soul, to fuck you over,\u201d sings David Bowie on Killing a Little Time, one of three new songs on the album of his stage musical Lazarus. Now there\u2019s a lyric to conjure with. It\u2019s so playfully, poignantly appropriate for one of Bowie\u2019s very last recordings that it\u2019s hard to resist the idea that he is addressing us directly that it\u2019s a morbid showbusiness flourish from a dying man. But is that all there is to a Bowie song? Bowie was never one for straightforward autobiography.",
        "Everywhere you look right now, the election is hovering right there in the distance, like one of those creepy clowns trying to lure children into the woods with candy. It\u2019s all over the news, our social media, and even our Halloween costumes. The cultural obsession with the presidency even bleeds into our television shows. This fall we\u2019ve already seen the introduction of a new president on Designated Survivor, and this Sunday we get another one on Graves.",
        "Television is often accused by faith leaders of marginalising religion. But, if this sin of omission exists, the charitable explanation would be that the subject imposes a double penance on schedulers. In a largely secular society, not only is the potential audience for shows on religious subjects small, but those few who might tune in tend to be hypersensitive about coverage of their beliefs or those of rival worldviews. But, though theology may be a minority interest, the politics and psychology of the Vatican have long proved a fascination, and TV fiction has often genuflected towards Rome.",
        "Just three days after being axed as Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski was hired as a talking head on CNN. From this position he\u2019s already spinning election coverage in Trump\u2019s favor \u2014 witness his reaction to the big speech in Pennsylvania. Trump was admittedly strong, focusing on international trade deals and showcasing his newfound command of the teleprompter. Lewandowski described it in hyperbolic terms, dubbing it \u201cMr Trump\u2019s best speech of the presidential cycle, candidly\u201d \u2014 candidly!",
        "The US justice department will investigate the police shooting of a Native American woman in Arizona, a spokesman said on Friday, a day after footage released by the Winslow police department raised concerns about racial bias in the fatal shooting. The department\u2019s civil rights division will review the local investigation into the 27 March shooting death of Loreal Tsingine, spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle said. Tsingine, 27, was shot and killed by Winslow police officer Austin Shipley in late March after officers suspected her of shoplifting in a local store and confronted her.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign seized on the guilty verdicts handed down in the \u201cBridgegate\u201d trial on Friday, suggesting the New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, should resign as the head of the transition team for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump. Two former aides to Christie were convicted of creating an epic traffic jam at the George Washington Bridge in September 2013, for what prosecutors said was political revenge, capping a trial that cast doubt on Christie\u2019s claims he knew nothing about the scheme.",
        "One gargantuan challenge away from the Euro 2016 final on home soil, there are four members of France\u2019s squad who know better than most what a successful climax would mean to the bigger picture of French football. Six years ago, in the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein, Les Bleus were in disgrace. At the 2010 World Cup, in front of anyone on the planet who cared to notice, France combusted in a manner that stank the place out.",
        "Rumors of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s death may have been greatly exaggerated \u2014 but by his own user website, as a glitch on Friday afternoon led Facebook to declare two million users, including Zuckerberg himself, prematurely dead. People logging in to their accounts to find that they had been \u201cmemorialized\u201d with a message saying (in Zuckerberg\u2019s case): \u201cWe hope people who love Mark will find comfort in the things others share to remember and celebrate his life. \u201d Just a day earlier, Zuckerberg had said the idea that fake news on Facebook could sway people in their voting decisions was \u201ccrazy\u201d.",
        "Last summer Matt Black left the Central Valley of California, where he lives, to travel 18, 000 miles across the US on a road trip that took him through 30 states and 70 of the poorest towns in America. The startling image of a hand resting on a fence post against a barren backdrop was taken in the small town of Allensworth, California, where 54% of the population of 471 people live below the poverty level.",
        "police chief Kerr Putney has just told Fox News that the person taken to hospital with \u201c injuries\u201d earlier today has died, in a second night of protests over the death of black man. Boxing promoter and convicted manslaughterer Don Kin joined Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Fox News host Sean Hannity\u2019s town hall aimed at winning the hearts of African American voters today, a sentence we never thought we\u2019d be typing.",
        "Venezuela and Colombia have agreed to the gradual reopening of their border one year after the Venezuelan government closed crossings to crack down on smuggling. The announcement came after presidents Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela and Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia met in the Venezuelan city of Puerto Ordaz. The two agreed to begin the process starting on Saturday. Officials will open five border checkpoints for pedestrians from 6am to 9pm each day. The weekend is sure to see a crush of Venezuelans flooding into Colombia to buy food and medicine.",
        "Does the route suit him? Yes. The defending champion said in October that he prefers the 2016 edition to last year\u2019s route. \u201cIt\u2019s a very well rounded Tour,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to take a complete cyclist to win. \u201d Froome will be licking his lips at the two time trials \u2014 37km on stage 13 and 17km on stage 18 \u2014 although neither is flat, which will lessen his chances of gaining huge chunks of time on Quintana and Contador. The right ?",
        "A couple of years after the October revolution of 1917, the painter and sculptor Vladimir Tatlin submitted a proposal for the headquarters of the Communist International, as part of a public sculpture competition. Placed on the banks of the Neva, its towering, tilting steel skeleton would have housed the Comintern in glass volumes whose rotation would symbolise revolution and the dialectic.",
        "Everybody has fear,\u201d says Albert Woodfox. \u201cFear is the soul telling the body that it\u2019s in danger. Some people overcome that fear. I overcame it by having a cause. That\u2019s what the party told me: always be honourable, always serve the people. \u201d Woodfox, now a grizzled has had more reasons to be afraid than most, and when he says that he has known \u201cmore pain and suffering than any human being should be asked to suffer\u201d he is not exaggerating.",
        "What do you get if you cross Total Football with ? Ramba Zamba fussball, the name given to the colourful, vibrant style of West Germany in the early 1970s. The positions in their formation were little more than a basis for negotiation. No one demonstrated the fluidity of the team better than Franz Beckenbauer, who was sort of the original John Stones. He had moved back from midfield to create the position of attacking sweeper and was so cool he played international football with a resting heart rate.",
        "It\u2019s 4am at the dock on Block Island, a New England vacation spot situated off Rhode Island, and tempers are fraying among fishermen competing in one of the region\u2019s growing number of big money \u201cmonster\u201d shark fishing tournaments. At the previous night\u2019s gathering, one fisherman tore off his shirt and hurled it at the organizers, enraged at what he saw as an insufficient prize pot. Then, on the opening morning of a contest to reel in the largest shark, anger flares from a very different source."
