        "Three, one, one \u2026 Panic! With less than a week to go before ordinary citizens have to decide whether they want to remain citizens of the European Union, folks in the United States are quickly waking up to the fact that the outcome of that Brexit vote will actually have an impact on financial markets at stake. True, whatever happened to the Standard Poor \u2019 s 500 index index on 23 June, in comparison to the vote results, probably will pale in comparison to either the sigh of relief or the ripples of power that will flow through Europe \u2019 s capital markets.",
        "When Gary Cooper arrived at work in Stoke Newington police station, Central London, in January last year he was told a small boy had been stabbed to death. Jeremie Malenge, 17, was found slumped on the bed with stab wounds in his legs. There was CCTV footage of the boy being strangled by three figures wearing sports clothes. After they showed the video, the murder investigation team called security. The police officer is wirily beautiful and casually dressed.",
        "An prosciutto producer has appealed for help after an earthquake on Sunday devastated Norcia, an Apennine town famous for its cured meats. \u201c I don \u2019 t have anything left, everything is destroyed, \u201d explains Valentina Fausti, whose top ham \u2014 known in Italian as prosciutto crudo \u2014 sells for \u20ac150 ( \u00a3135 ) a kilo. The challenges facing prosciutto makers Cristina Fausti and her company, Maiale brado di Norcia, caused yet another threat to the area \u2019 s cultural landscape, where thousands of residents become homeless by Sunday \u2019 s 6.",
        "Apple lost a battle to convince customers to switch to wireless headphones after controversially scrapping the headphone feature on the new iPhone 7, users have warned. Electrical companies are enjoying an increase in mobile headphone sales after Apple \u2019 s release on Wednesday, but the market has been dogged by concerns about the sound quality, volume and durability of products. The removal of the speakers means iPhone customers must buy new headphones or use an adaptor to connect wired headphones to the battery port.",
        "Rejoice! The new Ghostbusters is good. Very good, in fact. It had to be. No one has faced more advance scrutiny even hostility \u2014 than Jim Feig \u2019 s reboot of Ivan Reitman \u2019 s beloved 1980s series. It didn \u2019 t seem to matter Feig \u2019 s previous record with mainstream television is peerless. Since hitting his major screen stride with Bridesmaids ( 2011 ) the new veteran has consistently produced : his two subsequent romance comedies, The Heat ( 2013 ) and Spy ( 2015 ) were spry and hilarious both fronted by his muse, the venerable Melissa McCarthy, who he corralled into this Ghostbusters.",
        "Donald Trump insisted on Thursday that he was \u201c hitting hard \u201d even during the spring holiday, as the latest news around the \u2019 s cabinet centred on billionaire distressed debt investor Wilbur Ross. Trump is enjoying the holiday with his family at his in Miami Beach, Florida, a resort resort which has a $ 100, 000 membership base plus $ 14, 000 in annual dues. Late Wednesday he made a personal appeal saying it was time to \u201c begin to heal our hearts \u201d after a bruising campaign.",
        "Simon Cowell, the inventor of reality TV brain wrecks, is back in America and not a minute too soon. We \u2019 re currently going to suss out whether to elect a game show host as the new leader of the free press, so why not dig up the original big boy of crap television so that he might reclaim his throne in this moment of ultimate cultural revolution? The only snag in this scenario is that Cowell \u2019 s gone insane on us, trading in his former British cynicism for a healthy slab of American cheese.",
        "Our family lunch table was a rectangle of bare oak, with a worn surface patterned with fruit from the tree. At one end, there was a drawer full of expensive stuff : rubber bullets, bicycle repair kits, mints. As a hungry child, I tended this table. It was where I ate eggy bread and beef stew with fluffy suet dumplings, and raspberries and potatoes covered in sugar.",
        "At what age are you too young to achieve breakthrough status in your field? That question fascinates so many people, I suspect, because otherwise nobody considers themselves even entirely successful. The romance novelist longs to be published, the number one yearns for bestsellerdom, the bestselling superstar craves the Booker title. ( Also, everyone else thinks they \u2019 re just a few years from being \u201c over the years \u201d.",
        "On a visit to Boston, the site of a recent police shooting of a black student that led to protests, Democratic presidential nominee Bill Clinton said on Facebook that gun violence in the US should call the country to do more to make \u201c all of God \u2019 s children \u201d. In Washington DC, meanwhile, unidentified perpetrators sprayed graffiti on Republican nominee Donald Trump \u2019 s Manhattan luxury hotel, making the phrase \u201c black lives matter \u201d a rallying cry of the black movement that has arisen over recent killing of black men at the home of police officers.",
        "Nicole Hockley, who raised her son in the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre in 2012, faced a row of TV cameras on Tuesday. She and other Sandy Hook families were making an appeal in their battle against the pharmaceutical companies who had made the bombs used to kill their son. What was her reaction to Donald Trump \u2019 s victory, reporters told her. Was she scared? Hockley, composed and forceful, said a reality check : Even if Hillary Clinton had been elected president, Congress might not have passed gun safety legislation.",
        "Superman escapes, Wonder Woman charms and two Batmen are on the way. The film showed Warner Bros release a preview from 2017 \u2019 s Justice League and the first trailer for its Wonder Woman film on Sunday morning. The San Diego releases also chose to tease two very different takes on Batman : Ben Affleck \u2019 s forthcoming film, which he will direct and star in, and the Lego Batman franchise starring Will Arnett. Affleck compared the movie \u2019 s story to history \u2019 s best dramas. \u201c It \u2019 s like a historical play that has been done a bunch of times before, \u201d he said.",
        "The footprints of five species of humans who walked the site more than 3. 6m years ago have been found preserved in volcanic ash that was dampened by ancient African activity. Researchers unearthed the tracks by hand when they began to excavate test marks that had been called for as part of an assessment of the impact of building a science museum on the site in Tanzania. The markings reveal that the two human relatives walked side by side for at least 30 metres.",
        "The vast hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica appears to be healing, scientists say, putting the world on track to eventually remedy one of the biggest environmental concerns of the 1980s and 90s. Research by US and UK scientists shows that the size of the ozone void has shrunk, on average, by around 4m sq km since 2000. The measurements were taken from the month of September in each year, when the ozone hole starts to open up each year.",
        "There are times when, as a politician, you have hold your nose, to smile politely and get on with it. Yesterday, in New Zealand\u2019s parliament, was supposed to be one of those times. My Green party colleagues and I were asked to support a government motion to congratulate Donald Trump on winning the US presidential election. These types of motions are fairly commonplace in our parliament. They are token gestures of support and diplomacy \u2014 convenient ways to express our best wishes to political leaders in faraway places. They usually pass with little fanfare.",
        "Paul Wilson\u2019s report on a manic, memorable match is below. Thanks for your company. I\u2019ll leave you with one last email. \u201cRidiculously,\u201d says Matt Dony, \u201cI\u2019m watching this thinking \u2018In the final, I fancy Wales\u2019 chances against Italy more than Spain. ..\u2019 The other good news for Italy is that, of all the players on a yellow card, only Thiago Motta was booked and will miss the Germany game. And of course, they get delicious rewenge for the thrashing in the final four years ago.",
        "Anyone who has seen the documentary Weiner may not have been entirely surprised that it was former congressman Anthony Weiner who threw a late spanner in the works of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. The film charts in excruciating detail the collapse of a political career and, ultimately, of a marriage. Weiner\u2019s laptop is now reportedly under scrutiny by the FBI lest it contain emails pertinent to Clinton\u2019s private server. But if there is a movie sequel to be made, it might be called Podesta.",
        "\u201cI think this Fall is going to be my moment to finally acquire a poodle,\u201d says Greta Gerwig, sounding exactly like Greta Gerwig. She\u2019s walking through New York and every bit of could be a line from one of her charming, films. She warns of \u201cthe risk of the walking interview\u201d (police sirens). She talks of eating like a wolf. She enthuses about a 1926 novel called Lolly Willowes (\u201cIt\u2019s kind of about a woman who becomes a witch!",
        "The news site Breitbart has declared \u201c#WAR\u201d on Kellogg\u2019s, calling for a boycott of the cereal company\u2019s products after they decided to cease advertising on the site. On Tuesday, the Kellogg Company pulled their adverts from the site, saying that it wasn\u2019t \u201caligned with our values\u201d.

        "In his awkward, halting joint interview with his new running mate, Mike Pence, Sunday night, Donald Trump offered a preview of what could be a very uncomfortable week in Cleveland for Republican standard bearers. Trump has tried to obfuscate the lack of political star power in the convention lineup by putting his progeny in speaker seats usually occupied by the likes of past Republican presidents (the only ones living refuse to attend). But he\u2019ll need more than blood relatives to spare him the indignity of being left at the altar by party insiders.",
        "He is best known for poetry on the pitch, but when footballer Lionel Messi appeared in court accused of tax fraud, his performance was decidedly more prosaic. The Barcelona and Argentina forward denied any knowledge of the tax issues that led to the charges against him, saying that he signed documents without reading them because he trusted his father and the advisers responsible for managing his finances. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything,\u201d Messi told the court in Barcelona on Thursday. \u201cI only worried about playing football. \u201d Asked what he knew of the alleged \u20ac4. 1m (\u00a33.",
        "What do your preferences in art tell us about your personality? To find out, simply choose which of these two pictures you prefer \u2026 A study carried out at the University of Amsterdam found that participants who prefer abstract over figurative (ie \u201ctraditional\u201d) paintings generally score higher on measures of sensation seeking. Those who prefer figurative paintings (who also tend to dislike plays) score higher on tests that measure \u201cneed for cognitive closure\u201d.",

        "Hailing the values and resilience that he says both define and sustains Americans, President Barack Obama on Saturday honored the nearly 3, 000 people who were killed in the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, as well as the bravery of survivors and the emergency personnel who responded, and the work of scores of others who have labored since to keep the US safe.

        "What does a porn star wear when she hits the campaign trail? A smile. And a black net brassiere with intricate straps. A very short, peach satin romper open to the waist. A whole lot of deeply tanned skin. And a fist full of \u201cNo on Proposition 60\u201d pamphlets. Not familiar with Proposition 60? Neither were most of the students Tasha Reign (her nom de sc\u00e8ne) encountered on a sunny Monday at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).",
        "A UN negotiation is inching towards a landmark deal to curb emissions from airplanes, although environmental groups have warned that the plan will not go far enough to help slow climate change. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) a UN agency, has gathered more than 2, 000 government officials from around the world at its Montreal headquarters to adopt the first ever international mechanism to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from aviation. A scheme has been proposed at the triennial meeting whereby emissions from aviation will be measured from a baseline to be set in 2020.",
        "In the long Kabuki dance that is a presidential election, there are only one or two moments that even come close to a decision worthy of the Oval Office. All the rest is commentary. For Donald Trump, we are fast approaching one of those moments. In the next two weeks, the property developer will make his most fateful decision since he fired Meat Loaf from Celebrity Apprentice. Who deserves the peculiar honor of serving the nation just a heartbeat away from an president?",
        "The calendar insists the end is near for Venus Williams, but the results continue to dissent. The American \u2014 the oldest woman in the top 200 and the oldest in the draw here \u2014 overcame a game challenge from Maria Sakkari in an entertaining tilt on Thursday to book a meeting with Russia\u2019s Daria Kasatkina in the round of 32.",
        "Free speech in the United States is having a rough go of it lately. Everywhere I turn, there\u2019s some misanthrope whinging about San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick\u2019s Banner protest. How dare he denigrate the stars and stripes, a venerable symbol of protest against tyranny, by protesting? Then there\u2019s the candidates running for president. Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green party candidate Dr Jill Stein, despite surprisingly potent campaigns that are tapping into wellsprings of dissatisfaction with the status quo, will very likely be held out of the upcoming debates."
