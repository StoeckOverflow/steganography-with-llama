        "The commercials have begun airing. The votes have been counted. The people have spoken. Donald Trump will be the 45th president of the United States. I was reluctant to join Trump even though I am a Republican, because right or left, he caters to many Americans \u2019 trying to the see the progress in the economy slow down a bit just so they can sober up. I also have grave concerns about building walls across our country, and I fear what the consequences will be when we start isolating our economy from reality.",
        "Sarah Davis grew up on a small ranch in southern Illinois. As a child, she dreamed of escaping the suburban life and moving to a glitzy place like Chicago. What she didn \u2019 t think then was that a few thousand pumpkin seeds would one day make her a hero. Listen to people tell her inspiring words. This content is paid for by Principal",
        "The story opens simply : \u201c In the spring of 1971, I killed a girl. \u201d It was written in the vein of classic, southern romance, told by a man whose hands shook and voices quavered. All that made the narrative, about a girl who has fascinated and inspired her husband for 45 years, more riveting. If anyone asks whether Bill Bradley still \u201c has it \u201d his tour de force speech at the annual convention on Tuesday afternoon should have erased any doubts.",
        "Before dawn on Wednesday, Yusef, 35, a pharmacist who had fled violence in Iraq, stuffed some blankets into a thick backpack and bid farewell to the muddy puddles surrounding his little tent. Once, he had hoped to stow away on a lorry to England. \u201c But that dream happened here, \u201d he said. \u201c That bridge is everywhere.",
        "In the beginning, they were known as die D\u00f6nermorde \u2014 the kebab murders. The two had little in common, apart from immigrant backgrounds and the smaller businesses they ran. The last to die was Enver \u015eim\u015fek, a man who operated a company in the southern Bavarian town of Nuremberg. On 9 February 2000, he was shot inside his home by two gunmen, and died in jail two days later. The following June, in the same year, Abdurrahim \u00d6z\u00fcdo\u011fru was killed by two policemen while helping out after hours in a tailor \u2019 s workshop.",
        "If it looks and feels like a scandal, is it actually a scandal? The latest FBI email flap has all the trappings of evidence. With evasive answers, shady characters and complicated investigations, there must be something going on. Right? Looks like Saddam \u2019 s weapons of mass destruction, we might not know what \u2019 s hidden or where, but it also looks like the Clintons have been plotting something. Sadly, this reasoning is good for most Republican voters and a good chunk of independents.",
        "The nonpartisan commission that produces the presidential debates has benefit from a pool of deep experience in selecting hosts for this year \u2019 s three scheduled meetings between Donald Trump and Bill Clinton. While none of the moderators scheduled on Friday has hosted a presidential debate before, all four moderated presidential debates this year. The commission on Presidential Debates additionally hired a moderator for this year \u2019 s single guest, CBS News correspondent Elaine Quijano. She has never chaired a debate. Moderating can be thankless work.",
        "This was France \u2019 s worst performance by a long shot, despite conceding their first ( and thus second ) goal from single play in the tournament. For the second time, aided of France by scoring early, they did not get overweighed by the pressure of being hosts. Their technically outstanding players all found the net and despite having the pace killed off by their work ethic stand strong. They also have a couple of notable advantages before joining Germany in that mouthwatering : a fully trained squad and a mildly exciting path here.",
        "I look at photographs of men my age and wonder if women look as much alike as men do in their first decade. I doubt it, because most of men come with colourful accessories. We \u2019 re excited by this stage of life. We \u2019 re looking for a best friend, an accomplice, as well as an inamorato. We expect he will come with thinning muscles, loose skin and tight joints, same as us. The tattoos men put up are always blurry. The most popular pose is the selfie in a wall mirror.",
        "You can catch Gabby Hayes on television again next season, though you won \u2019 t see her performing a routine on the uneven bars. Instead, the Olympic silver medalist will judge the 2017 Miss America pageant in Kansas City next month. \u201c Miss America has been such an extraordinary event for so many years and I am excited to have the opportunity to enter the competition this year, \u201d Douglas told USA Today in a statement on Monday.",
        "Flames tore through dry brush near four homes and caused more than 1, 000 people to flee a nearby California lake town that was evacuated in a devastating wildfire last year. Authorities ordered about 1, 200 residents to leave 500 homes as the flames surged south of the city of Lower Lake. The wildfire rose to more than two square miles by early Sunday, and crews faced hot air and little cloud cover as they tried to get a fix on the flames burning rapidly out of control.",
        "A college in the Canadian province of New Brunswick plans to institute a program on marijuana cultivation so that students can be trained to work at different companies that produce the seeds. The College Communautaire du will create the course next fall, said Michel Doucet, former director of continuing education and customized learning. Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau began last year on a motion to legalize recreational marijuana, and the university has said it would repeal legislation by the spring of 2017.",
        "So ends the 1st Round of the NBA Draft... and the liveblog of the same. The 2nd draft will be completed tonight, but you are on your own for that. Thanks for following along. Congratulations to the Sixers, Wizards and all the international players coming tonight. There were also probably a few picks who weren \u2019 t covered by either of those categories. Draft year is almost over, but the NBA offseason is only half started. Free play begins in eight rounds. Kevin Durant! Kevin Durant! Kevin Durant!",
        "The European Union has ordered Apple to pay back the Irish market up to \u20ac13bn in taxes in a landmark decision. Apple paid a tax rate on European taxes of between 0. 005 % and 1 % according to the EU \u2019 s enforcement arm. The US investment group, and Ireland, have said they will appeal against the decision but it will have ramifications for consumers and companies across Europe. The commission has found that Apple benefited from a sweetheart court ruling granted by Ireland decades ago, despite the huge sums in taxes over many years.",

        "A New Hampshire family\u2019s missing rubber duck has suddenly reappeared, along with a suitcase full of souvenirs and an international mystery. Stolen in 2011, the Troiano family\u2019s duck returned home last week, Seacoastonline reported. In the years since it disappeared, the family has received countless postcards and photos from \u201cGale Ducky\u201d as it traveled around the globe. The yellow duck had visited 20 countries on its journey, from Austria to South Africa. A Facebook account for the duck was created, presumably by its anonymous travel buddy, and has just over 800 likes from people following its journey.",
        "She\u2019s one of the most celebrated performers of the modern era, and on Tuesday Beyonc\u00e9 earned even more accolades, with 11 nominations in the MTV Video Music Awards for her Lemonade project. The \u201cvisual album\u201d was released in April, two months after its politically charged Formation video was unveiled just before Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s controversial appearance at the Super Bowl. Adele received eight nominations for the awards, seven of which were her video Hello, directed by the young Canadian Xavier Dolan.",
        "Donald Trump struck his most stridently isolationist notes yet on Wednesday, following up a day of controversy over his call for Russia to hack into and release Hillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails with an assertion that Nato\u2019s principle that an attack on one is an attack on all should be conditional on every member country paying \u201ctheir fair share\u201d. \u201cI want to keep Nato, but I want them to pay,\u201d Trump told a rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania.",
        "Beauty has seizures, and she worries about what she\u2019ll be doing when the next one occurs. She was lucky with the first: she was in bed asleep next to her boyfriend, who woke to the bed shaking and was quick to pry his girlfriend\u2019s jaw open to prevent her from biting her tongue. Since then she\u2019s fallen down in the street and ended up alone in the hospital ICU, and so she lives in fear. She thought she was doing the right thing by sticking with K2, her drug of choice.",
        "The release of the professor watchlist, purporting to expose professors who discriminate against conservative students, is anything but that. I should know: I\u2019m on it. As one of a handful of religion professors in the US who study, write and teach about conservative Christianity and politics, I am all too aware of the real meaning of the list, and of its purpose. Promoted by Turning Point USA, the list is not simply designed to expose professors who discriminate it is designed to silence and smear.",
        "It\u2019s been called the curse of The Mummy. On Tuesday afternoon, for the briefest of moments, the Imax YouTube page accidentally hosted an unfinished trailer of Tom Cruise\u2019s new film. Every aspect was in place \u2014 the stunts, the music, the dialogue \u2014 except for one thing: the sound effects had completely disappeared. And since the trailer for The Mummy is almost all sound effects, it made for a discombobulating watch. When Cruise\u2019s plane hits turbulence, all its passengers bob up and down silently.",
        "The fatal shooting of a police officer in Kansas City, Kansas, was not part of a planned ambush, but the work of someone trying to evade arrest, authorities said Wednesday. Police chief Terry Zeigler said during a news conference that authorities had two young men in custody, but declined to give details about possible charges. He added that the attack wasn\u2019t part of the recent string of shootings of police in the US, but that \u201chate against police has got to stop\u201d.",
        "Cuba has declared nine days of national mourning to mark the death of Fidel Castro, whose demise at the age of 90 has prompted emotional scenes in Havana and Miami, tributes and reflections from world leaders, and ushered the island into an uncertain era. The US president, Barack Obama \u2014 who two years ago brokered a deal to restore diplomatic ties between Washington and Havana for the first time since they were severed in 1961 \u2014 offered his condolences and said the thoughts and prayers of the US were with the Cuban people.",
        "At the Softex refugee camp in northern Greece, it is lighter by night than it is by day. Inside this windowless former warehouse, the lamps only work in the evenings. That is partly because the place was not designed to house people. It is part of what was a toilet paper factory. \u201cIt\u2019s insulting,\u201d says Hendiya Asseni, a Syrian, of being housed in a store. \u201cBut then everything here is insulting \u2014 the life, the food, the fact we have a toilet in front of our tent.",
        "Clayton Kershaw is the greatest pitcher of his time so why wouldn\u2019t he want to finish one of the greatest playoff games in recent memory? He stood in the Los Angeles Dodgers dugout in the eighth inning of Thursday\u2019s already draining Game 5 of a draining National League Division Series against Washington and wondered how possibly the team\u2019s closer Kenley Jansen could pitch three innings when he was accustomed to only throwing one. He had made 211 pitches in the previous seven days, just weeks after returning from a back injury that once threatened to end his season.",
        "As I watched the tape of Donald Trump joking about sexually assaulting women, there were multiple moments that disgusted me, but only one that literally turned my stomach. It wasn\u2019t when the Republican presidential nominee talked about trying to \u201cfuck\u201d a woman who wasn\u2019t interested, or made a joke about her \u201cbig phony tits\u201d. It wasn\u2019t when he said that famous men can do anything to women, even \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d. The moment that literally nauseated me came later, when Trump knew he was being taped.",
        "Nuance isn\u2019t a huge priority for this goofily ridiculous and disposable comedy directed by Will Speck and Josh Gordon whose 2007 comedy Blades of Glory is incidentally growing in prestige to the level of Zoolander and Anchorman.",
        "Authorities in Cameroon rushed more than 600 injured people to hospitals in the country\u2019s two main cities on Saturday a day after an overcrowded train derailed, killing more than 70 people. Bodies remained strewn along the tracks at Eseka, which is about 75 miles west of Yaound\u00e9, as rescue workers searched for more injured or dead.
