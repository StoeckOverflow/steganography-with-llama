        "Amy Schumer was associated with booing and walkouts in Florida over the weekend after she broke jokes about Donald Trump. Around 200 people saw her show at the Amalie Arena in Chicago after the controversial comic gave the Republican candidate an \u201c sized, monster \u201d. According to the Tampa Bay Times, Schumer tackles issues ranging from the economy to gun control, an issue she \u2019 s spoken out about before following the event that took place at a screening of her film Trainwreck in 2015.",
        "Alabama \u2019 s parole board decided on law against freeing a Ku Klux Klansman accused in a church bombing that killed four black churches more than 50 years ago. The resolution to keep Thomas Jefferson Blanton Jr, 76, imprisoned was met with applause at the hearing. Relatives of the three killed spoke against Blanton \u2019 s conviction during the hearing. Blanton is the last remaining KKK member convicted of participating in the bombing of Birmingham \u2019 s 16th Street Baptist church.",
        "The plight of child workers is at the heart of this year \u2019 s News and Observer charity work. We supported refugees last year and we are proud to contribute to this theme again. It remains the largest humanitarian crisis of our times. The political mood has grown around immigration, and in a free world the tragedy of child migration can seem distinctly visible. Yet the irony is inescapable : in Europe, thousands of children are stuck in squalid camps or driven rough, caught up in political turmoil beyond their means and exposed to multiple fronts.",
        "A lot has changed since Nicholas Wilson, then a permanent secretary at the CIA, produced his landmark explanation of the impact of climate change 10 years ago. His research was quickly recognised as the definitive account of the economic problems posed to the planet by global warming. Since then, sea temperatures have risen to unprecedented levels. Arctic Antarctic sea ice has continued to shrink, as have many Arctic ice sheets. Carbon dioxide is being pumped into the air in amounts.",

He had to make an admission to his next client \u2014 a who was facing death in prison for stealing another \u2019 s wallet and cellphone at gunpoint. \u201c I don \u2019 t do criminal justice, \u201d he told the teenager, William Williams Jr. \u201c But I tell you, I \u2019 ll definitely try my best. \u201d Goodwin typically contacted insurance companies in litigation following car accidents.",
        "The future of the national party begins with open house at the Democratic Central Committee ( DNC ). Without a leading progressive committed to a Republican leading our party \u2014 and a DNC president committed to humble support and genuine advocacy for peoples \u2019 needs \u2014 we are doomed to end of 8 November. Hillary Clinton \u2019 s platform may have been the most influential in American history, but the American people felt it wasn \u2019 t fair to have a good plan on earth.",
        "Barack Obama addressed on Saturday the police attack in Dallas that wounded five officers and its leaders to the broader movement against domestic violence, declaring : \u201c We may let the actions of a few hit all of us. \u201d Speaking from Twitter, Obama added that the convicted shooter was a \u201c demented individual \u201d who did not know black Americans, any more than a black man who killed three black people at a restaurant in Charleston, South Carolina, last year among white people.",

        "Donald Trump was rushed off the stage by Secret Service agents on Saturday night while making a speech at a rally in Nevada, sparking outrage in the crowd. The Republican president shielded his eyes and looked into the microphone and was then suddenly removed from view by two agents as a fight unfolded near the venue. Several witnesses stated they heard shouts of \u201c he \u2019 s wearing a gun \u201d. The incident prompted the crowd to react in kind, with several hundred protesters surging towards the back of the rally in Reno. However, one of those witnesses saw a pistol.",
        "ESPN made television history with the introduction of Naci\u00f3n ESPN last week, the network \u2019 s first Spanish sports show, targeted towards a audience. The show has grown out of another of the same spots on the ESPN Deportes but the new show airs on the ESPN2. \u201c Naci\u00f3n ESPN will appeal to the audience in a way that resonates with their current multicultural lifestyles and interests, \u201d said Roberto Rol\u00f3n, and general manager of ESPN Deportes. \u201c The new show will mirror the crossover that exists between the three, serving as an authentic link between the ESPN and ESPN Deportes teams.",
        "Chinese electronics firm Xiongmai is initiating a product recall after the enormous hacking attack that took down much of the internet on the eastcoast of the US and also affected Europe on Friday. The root of the attack, which took the form of a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) was a network of hacked \u201cInternet of Things\u201d devices, such as webcams and digital recorders, many of which were made by Xiongmai.",
        "Canada is exploring the use of options on identity cards, Justin Trudeau told a television station on Sunday as he became the first Canadian prime minister to march in a gay pride parade. Trudeau, who participated in the downtown Toronto parade along with other politicians, did not give details, saying only the government was exploring the \u201cbest way\u201d and studying other jurisdictions. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the great arc of history sweeping towards justice,\u201d he told CP24.",
        "In the back room of a pub in Kentish Town, a group of Londoners are perched on stools, eating hummus and talking about property.

        "Had his life turned out differently, this night, billed Gucci Mane and Friends, could have been an anniversary show. His debut album, Trap House, a basic template for Atlanta\u2019s homegrown subgenre trap rap, turned 10 in May of last year. Instead, Gucci is fresh out of federal prison on a weapons charge. Welcome as it was, this homecoming at Atlanta\u2019s Fox Theatre was also Gucci\u2019s bid to reassert himself as he the rap world. The \u201ctrap\u201d in what was once called \u201ccoke rap\u201d is an abandoned house with windows.",
        "If \u201cdust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return\u201d the Bible offers little guidance about how \u2014 and where \u2014 this final reconstitution should occur in the modern age of cremation. The proportion of deaths in the UK that were followed by cremation tipped over half in 1968, according to the Cremation Society. Today of us end up in an urn. Roger Kaiser recently triggered an inadvertent terror scare when he scattered ashes into the orchestra pit at the Met. The Texan opera buff had done it before.",
        "\u2018This is an embarrassing confession,\u201d novelist Jonathan Franzen admits, \u201c[but] I don\u2019t have very many black friends. \u201d The line comes at the beginning of a lengthy interview on Slate (to promote the paperback release of Franzen\u2019s latest novel, Purity) when reporter Isaac Chotiner inquires if \u2014 in light of America\u2019s \u201cweird year\u201d \u2014 Franzen would ever consider writing a book about race.",
        "There has been no attempt at Liverpool these past few days to dilute the biggest contest in English club football. \u201cIt will never be a normal game for as long as I live,\u201d J\u00fcrgen Klopp said on Friday, visibly excited three days before . For his captain, Jordan Henderson, the desire to ruin Manchester United\u2019s 84th league visit to Anfield will be intensified by the sight of one man: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. A rivalry that has carried an attritional edge for decades has a new ingredient.",
        "Police forces across England and Wales are considering expanding their definition of hate crime to include misogyny after an experiment in one city that saw more than 20 investigations launched in two months. The initial success of Nottingham\u2019s crackdown against sexist abuse has drawn national interest after the city\u2019s police revealed that they investigated a case of misogyny every three days during July and August, the first months to see specially trained officers targeting behaviour ranging from street harassment to unwanted physical approaches.",
        "Nasa hit a snag while releasing air into an experimental inflatable room at the International Space Station on Thursday and put everything on hold for at least a day. Mission Control ordered astronaut Jeffrey Williams to call it quits after the operation had dragged on for more than two hours, with the compartment expanding just a few inches. The inflation process could resume as early as Friday, depending on what engineers learn. \u201cThanks for all your patience today, and we\u2019ll hope for better luck tomorrow,\u201d Mission Control radioed. \u201cThat\u2019s space business,\u201d Williams replied.",
        "Muncie emerged as a factory city at the turn of the 20th century \u2014 becoming home to a number of glass manufacturers, iron and steel mills, industrial factories and fabricators, with a growing working class community \u2014 which continued to expand as General Motors and other makers invested in the town in the 20s. Half a century later, as Guardian photographer David Levene discovered when he explored Muncie, the effects of recession, foreign competition and changes in the labour market began a process of long industrial decline. The first site I visited was the former Chevy factory.",
        "Thanksgiving is a time for Americans to come together and celebrate it\u2019s a holiday that many look forward to all year. But this year, some Americans are feeling more anxiety than anticipation, as fallout from this bitter and divisive election continues to create conflict between friends and loved ones all over the country.

        "The remake of Roots has gained widespread critical acclaim \u2014 but not from Snoop Dogg, who posted a short video on Instagram on Monday criticising the show, and suggesting that African Americans should not watch it.

        "Donald Trump has predicted the breakup of the European Union and warned Scotland against the risks of a second independence referendum. During a visit to Scotland hours after Britain opted to leave the EU in a historic referendum, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said that without strict migration controls Europe would be unrecognisable within a decade. In an interview with the Times, Trump said: \u201cThe people have spoken. I think the EU is going to break up. I think the EU might break up before anybody thinks in terms of Scotland.",
        "American diplomats who helped broker the Northern Ireland peace process have condemned the UK\u2019s vote to quit the European Union and described the prospect of a hard border with the Republic of Ireland as \u201chorrendous\u201d. The US was one of the main guarantors of the April 1998 Good Friday agreement and can point to the subsequent decline in sectarian violence as a signature foreign policy success in recent times. But last week\u2019s Brexit decision cast a shadow over the only part of the UK that shares a land border with the EU.",
        "Summer 2009: A small group of reporters ascended a hidden flight of stairs in the Mandalay Bay Convention Center. While thousands of people milled around the UFC\u2019s first Fan Expo, we were going up to a small room for a private audience with one of the most unlikely celebrities of our time. Kimbo Slice was waiting for us. We didn\u2019t know what to expect from a man we knew mostly from poundings of fellow Floridians on YouTube. And we soon found out he would play with our expectations.",
        "Mick Fanning has capped an extraordinary return to the scene of last year\u2019s shark attack, winning the World Surfing League event at Jeffreys Bay, South Africa. Fanning fought off what was believed to be a great white shark in the disbanded contest final of 2015, eventually fleeing the water uninjured with fellow Australian Julian Wilson.

In variable small swell, which saw the contest drag into its 11th day, Fanning beat Florence 17. 70 points to 17. 13.",
        "Canada confirmed on Sunday it had become aware of a citizen taken hostage in Libya and was \u201cdiligently pursuing all appropriate channels to obtain more information\u201d. Libyan authorities said last week a Canadian and two Italians had been kidnapped in the country\u2019s desert, possibly by a criminal gang. The Canadian government then called the matter \u201cunconfirmed\u201d.

        "David Mitchell, a regular contender for the Man Booker prize, is used to his novels being picked over by the critics. So it\u2019s something of a relief, says the British author, that his latest work \u2014 completed at 1am one Tuesday morning before a car arrived to take him to the airport to catch a flight to Norway \u2014 won\u2019t be seen by anyone until 2114. Mitchell is the second contributor to the Scottish artist Katie Paterson\u2019s Future Library project, for which 1, 000 trees were planted two years ago in Oslo\u2019s Nordmarka forest.",
        "The 1973 film Westworld, directed and written by Michael Crichton, was a crude movie about crude machines staffing a depraved theme park. Crichton\u2019s pleasure robots were either sexy toasters or bad toasters. When they malfunctioned, the machines simply played out their protocols and killed all but one guest. Remember how infected web cams and smart fridges brought down a chunk of the Internet last week? That, but with bullets. HBO\u2019s serial television expansion of Westworld\u2019s is staffed with robots beyond the toaster stage, androids flirting with consciousness. Considering the violence in play, this isn\u2019t necessarily an improvement.",
        "In a special edition of Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, Barack Obama told a \u201cspooky story\u201d about what happens when people don\u2019t vote: \u201cDonald Trump could be president. \u201d Dressed as \u201cwhat happens when young people vote\u201d Obama said he did the interview on her TBS show to encourage young people to vote. Bee was skeptical. \u201cIt turns out that young people actually are more interested and engaged than I think we give them credit for,\u201d Obama said, adding that his daughter Malia just voted for the first time this year."
