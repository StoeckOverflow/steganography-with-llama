        "The American Fisheries Board, the US Secretary of Agriculture \u2019 s arm, responded wrongly in its attempt to crush a mayonnaise startup, the USDA noted in a report. The Guardian reported last year that the American Egg Board ( AEB ) lobbied for a concerted focus on Hampton Creek, a mining company that has created a good replacement and the maker of Just Egg, a mayonnaise alternative.",
        "From my house overlooking Managua, the city at night seems like an amusement park \u2014 more Walt Disney World than the capital of the poorest country in the Pacific continent. Gigantic metal screens, each studded with hundreds of colored stars have been installed all over town. A few hundred have been fine, but 130 of them in our small community are overwhelming and kitsch. This makeover is the work of our famous first lady and writer Rosario Murillo : her way of imprinting herself in our culture.",
        "Five weeks ago, after the revelations, the House of Lords unanimously rejected Rupert Murdoch \u2019 s bid for 100 % of communications. A year later, Sky was only passed by Ofcom as being fit and qualified to hold a communications monopoly on the basis that there was not full market ownership and control. However, the Murdochs want to turn the power of parliament and the regulator on its toes. But what \u2019 s really changed?",
        "My professor friend AJ and I led a nationwide tour of college lectures earlier this week about police and policing in New York City. Between our stop at State Police Plaza, where \u201c destroyed windows \u201d policing was unleashed on our town, and the site of Eric Goldman \u2019 s death on Staten Island, we stopped at the newest structure in town at City Center Park. Mayor Bill de Blasio had just announced police commissioner Bill Bratton \u2019 s plans as we walked through the park, apparently achieving one of the young group \u2019 s three biggest goals when they appeared on camera.",
        "Donald Trump \u2019 s rally in Cincinnati on Thursday night was almost equal to any of the hundreds of public events he has held since saying he was running for president in early 2015. He aired grievances and launched broadsides against political rivals and the media. The public chanted \u201c lock her up \u201d when he mentioned Hillary Clinton, and \u201c build that courage \u201d when he talked about immigration. But there was one difference. Trump was addressing the rally as nearly a day after the general election was held.",
        "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was so enamoured of the goal here he declared : \u201c If you don \u2019 t play on it, stay home. \u201d So to witness this forced surrender from Manchester City did not please the manager. The goalless draw the contest was heading for was reason enough. But then Tonny Vilhena pulled the plug 12 minutes from time and Feyenoord were ready, though there was an offside during the buildup. What it means is Ajax suffered a second relegation within six months.",
        "Rachel Jones, the former partner of the Radiohead DJ Thom Yorke, has died aged 48. The artist and Oxford university lecturer, who had cancer, graduated from Yorke last year after 23 years together. They have two sons \u2014 Noah, 15, and Agnes, 12. Mary had been in poor health for the past year but continued to learn Italian into her last months. Her death on Sunday was celebrated by Pembroke College in an obituary posted online on Tuesday. She was an internationally renowned painter, mixing photography and printmaking, while her photographic work focused on French medieval literature.",
        "Donald Trump \u2019 s pivot is a tale of two hirings, and which actions he gives more weight to will have a decisive impact on the outcome of his campaigns. Most analysis thus far has revolved around Breitbart News columnist Stephen K Brannon, who next week was named the organization \u2019 s chief executive. It was a move widely seen as a rebuke to the more traditional presidential campaign that the recently ousted Paul Manafort sought to promote. But the hiring of Manafort \u2019 s actual aide, seasoned GOP operative Kellyanne Conway, tells a very different story.",
        "Colombia was thrust into uncertainty after a proposed trade deal between the government and Farc guerrillas was unexpectedly voted down in a referendum on Sunday. President Juan Manuel Santos and rebel politicians have pledged to keep fighting and met again in Havana on Friday, but the nation remains extremely divided after 50. 2 % of voters rejected the agreement and 49. 7 % supported it. We thank Colombian readers for their thoughts on the outcome of the vote and what they feel it will mean for the nation \u2019 s future. I am disappointed for Colombia.",
        "Demand for abortions has soared among women living in countries plagued by the spread of the Zika virus who fear having a baby with severe birth defects, new information shows. In unprecedented numbers, women in Latin America are accessing the website Women on Call, which has a long history of tracking those in countries where abortion is done to obtain pills which will stimulate an early pregnancy. In Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador the need for help have doubled, while in other Latin American countries they have grown by a third.",
        "An lawyer chatbot has successfully contested 160, 000 parking tickets across London and New York for free, demonstrating that chatbots can actually be useful. Dubbed as \u201c the world \u2019 s first robot lawyer \u201d by its creator, Stanford Law student Joshua Browder, DoNotPay lets users contest parking tickets in an easy to use interface. The program automatically works out whether an appeal is possible through a series of simple questions, such as were there clearly recognizable parking signs, and then points users through the appeals system. The results speak for themselves.",
        "Andy Murray survived a draining challenge by Radek Stepanek to squeeze into the second round of the French Open on Wednesday \u2014 and then he addressed a court of an entirely different kind to address the myth that Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo had quit as his coach because of his behaviour. After wrapping up unfinished business with the Czech \u2014 the loss of a record 51 players in the world \u2014 Murray turned to his other major \u201c problem \u201d in what was never intended to be a mundane press conference.",
        "When I became pregnant, the reason was to start a family, not to somehow embrace femininity or to . I\u2019m a transgender guy, born with typical female anatomy. I\u2019d taken testosterone for a few years and then stopped in order to conceive. I\u2019d also had chest surgery as part of my transition, so even as my belly grew, I sported a flat, chest and I maintained my beard.",
        "Dogs can remember what their owners have been up to, say researchers probing the nature of canine memory. A team from Hungary have discovered that dogs are able to recall their owner\u2019s actions, even when they were not specifically instructed to do so, suggesting that dogs, like humans, have what is known as \u201cepisodic memory\u201d \u2014 memories linked to specific times and places.",
        "Top police brass in Chicago continued their push on Tuesday to fire multiple officers involved in the fatal shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald. Police superintendent Eddie Johnson filed administrative charges against five officers, including Jason Van Dyke, the officer who shot McDonald 16 times at close range in 2014. Van Dyke has been charged with murder in McDonald\u2019s death. He has pleaded not guilty. All five officers lied in police reports or to investigators about McDonald\u2019s death, according to the charges filed by Johnson.",
        "The Denver Broncos\u2019 security staff is investigating a latter that was sent anonymously to linebacker Brandon Marshall at the team\u2019s headquarters. The handwritten letter, which Marshall posted to Instagram on Friday morning, addresses the veteran as a \u201cworthless fucking nigger\u201d and a \u201cspoiled fucking jigaboo\u201d in addition to other racial epithets. The writer went on to tell Marshall \u201cyour time is coming, watch out\u201d and \u201cwe are \u2018channeling\u2019 a devastating hard hit for you. Something to make you an invalid in a wheel chair.",
        "Lewis Hamilton has said he was pleased with his performance to claim pole position for Sunday\u2019s Mexican Grand Prix, ahead of his Mercedes Nico Rosberg, but has suggested that he could have gone even quicker. The world champion dominated qualifying and was of a second clear of Rosberg, who managed to come close to the British driver only on his final hot lap. Hamilton, who trails Rosberg by 26 points in the world championship, is in confident form after a win at the last round in Austin and has brought it to the Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez.",
        "In 2012, Bruce Springsteen released Wrecking Ball, an album groaning with grim tales of men who can\u2019t get jobs, money lenders who suck small towns dry and monuments torn down without regard to history or sentiment. At the time, it seemed an apt reflection of the lingering American recession. Now, it has come to light, it also reflected something personal. In a new interview with Vanity Fair, held to promote his upcoming autobiography Born to Run, the star talked about his lifelong wrestle with depression, a condition which took a particularly difficult turn when he was creating Wrecking Ball.",
        "They mostly come at night. Moments after sunset, and calling as they move, the Bombay night frogs climb high into the trees that overhang rivers swollen by the warm monsoon rains in the forests of Western Ghats in India. And then the action begins. On leaves, branches and tree trunks, the amphibians pair up. The female sends a willing signal by backing towards her male and touching his head with her toes. What follows is a mating position never seen before in the wild world of frog sex.",
        "Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke has thrown her name into the ring to play a female version of 007. In an interview with the UK\u2019s Daily Star, Clarke said, \u201cI have a lot of unrealised dreams. I would love to play Jane Bond. My ultimate leading man would be Leonardo DiCaprio. No doubt about it. \u201d Clarke made the comments while promoting her drama Me Before You, the \u2019s first major leading romantic role.",
        "San Francisco\u2019s gentrification wars have long fostered a certain element willing to make the debate over affordable housing extremely personal. During the first boom, members of the \u201cMission Yuppie Eradication Project\u201d posted flyers encouraging residents of the once Latino neighborhood to \u201cvandalize yuppie cars\u201d. During the current tech boom, as evictions soared, activists began using stencils to paint the sidewalks in front of certain buildings with an image of a suitcase and a message: \u201cTenants here forced out.",
        "A new academic study has found \u201ca pattern of discrimination\u201d against passengers with African names by Uber and Lyft drivers. The findings call into question a central narrative of apps that they solve the entrenched and humiliating problem of hailing a cab for black passengers. Waiting times for black passengers in Seattle were 35% longer than for white passengers, and drivers in Boston cancelled rides for black passengers more than twice as frequently as for white passengers, researchers found in a study published Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
        "Hundreds of thousands of civilians are bracing themselves for the start of an Iraqi army campaign to retake Mosul from Isis, which they fear will bring \u201cthe whole world\u201d to fight over their city. Militants have banned civilians from leaving the city, and have set up checkpoints on roads out and blown up the homes of those who do flee as punishment and to deter others.",
        "A little more than a year ago, the Food and Drug Administration put the brakes on a massive push by drugmakers to market testosterone treatments to the average man. A ad campaign had portrayed the drug as having extraordinary power to combat symptoms of ageing. But the FDA had become concerned about the potential for testosterone to increase heart risks. \u201cThe benefits and safety\u201d of testosterone treatments, the agency said in the order that ground the marketing campaign to a halt, \u201chave not been established\u201d. Now, a group of researchers have announced that they have established the benefits: none.",
        "In the late 90s and early 00s, before social media and smartphones, the coolest celebrities were coming in off a wave of grunge rock: Courtney Love, Eddie Vedder, Billy Corgan in music Winona Ryder and Gus Van Sant in film. The fin de si\u00e8cle vibe was parties, saturated colour, androgynous clothing. And the hottest literary commodity of the moment was JT LeRoy. LeRoy, a writer in a wig and hat, looked like a Culkin kid gone to seed. He went to all the cool parties.",
        "Time magazine denies doing it on purpose, yet the sign is there. The mark \u2014 and this one is much more visible than the 666 that I have been told by a maverick Vatican priest is tattooed on Donald Trump\u2019s left buttock. There was no unpredictability about Time\u2019s choice for its person of the year.",
        "Scroll down the \u201cpopular\u201d posts on Gab, the social network whose logo is not a blue bird, but a Pepe frog, and you\u2019ll get a different take on the election. The service was founded in August, following the banning of Breitbart\u2019s Milo Yiannopoulos from Twitter for harassment. Looking like a cleanly designed hybrid of Twitter and Reddit, it allows users to post updates without character limits, with memes, links and gifs. It appears to have had an influx of users in recent days.",
        "After almost 20 years at Old Trafford as player, coach and, finally, Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s assistant, Mike Phelan knows all about Manchester United\u2019s knack of scoring goals. Hull City\u2019s caretaker manager must have celebrated countless such winners but he could certainly have done without Marcus Rashford\u2019s clincher here. Perhaps determined to make Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Sam Allardyce sit up and take notice, the young England striker with an electric change of pace altered the game after stepping off the substitutes\u2019 bench and steering in Wayne Rooney centre from close range.",
        "Charlotte\u2019s police chief said on Wednesday that officers gave a man numerous clear warnings to drop a handgun before fatally shooting him, at a news conference following a night of clashes on the streets of the North Carolina city that left 16 officers injured. Kerr Putney, the police chief, said officers were searching for a suspect on Tuesday when they saw Keith Lamont Scott exit a vehicle with a handgun, and mistook him for the wanted man.",
        "Explosives experts have defused a large second world war bomb in the German city of Augsburg, clearing the way for thousands of evacuated residents to return and hold their Christmas celebrations at home. City police tweeted that they had \u201cgood news at Christmas\u201d just before 7pm local time (18. 00 GMT). Before that, they had been unable to say how long residents would have to stay away due to the sensitive explosives work being done."
