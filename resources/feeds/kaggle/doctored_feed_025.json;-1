        "When I came out of the closet and declared to my family that I was a lesbian at 19, I had just moved to San Antonio. Not yet ravaged by the Plague, the city was an extremely gay Mecca, still drunk on the relatively recent advent of gay people. As an introduction to the city I ran one of the \u201c \u201d workshops performed at the time, a seminar particularly attuned to gay men, where a common exercise involved begging your parents to let them know you \u2019 re gay. Because all my interest in art and disco wasn \u2019 t enough.",

Up to one in 10 teenagers and two in 10 children have a similar food allergy. In the 14 years to 2012 there was a 50 % decrease in hospital visits for anaphylaxis, the most severe allergic reaction. Infants and toddlers accounted for much of this increase.

Guzm\u00e1n \u2019 s lawyer, Jos\u00e9 Refugio Rodriguez, said several of the appeals argued that the statute of limitations has run out on some crimes Guzm\u00e1n is accused of in the United States.

        "Do the benefits of using social platforms to fund your journalism outweigh the disadvantages? Most publishers, even reluctantly, will say nothing and adopt the \u201c we are where we are \u201d argument. People put a more positive emphasis on things, maintaining that readers should go where their audience is, see what advertising revenue is available and trust that they can turn passing interest into loyal ( local ) readership. Yet could it be that the distraction from socially distributed newspapers \u2014 greater reach \u2014 also gives way to problems of dependency : loss of control and emotional damage?",
        "After 40 or more meetings, no one foreign ministers can judge each other better than the US head of state, John Kerry, and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Lavrov. Their latest marathon meeting in Geneva produced a complex and very detailed plan for a revolution in Syria and better NATO operations, as a prelude to peace. The declaration has the verbal support of the Russian government. Could it wait? That the announcement was immediately followed by an upsurge in violence is no indicator. The delay between announcement and deadline enables all parties to maximise their advantage.",
        "With Conmebol at the halfway line, and with an important round of qualifiers on Tuesday, it might seem timely to ponder the following : is this the most difficult confederation from which to prepare for the World Cup? President Su\u00e1rez certainly thinks so. \u201c yes, yes, yes, \u201d the French dynamo said last night when pressed on the how hard it was, so to say. \u201c The Argentinians can tell you, so can the Brazilians and the Colombians, all of them can tell you.

Both are now teenagers and do not know that they were donor conceived, nor that their father is not their biological parent.

        "Quietly, over the last year, Facebook has killed the concept of a private account. The site has always had a relationship with privacy: it\u2019s long offered some of the most granular controls of any social network for choosing who sees what content, letting users make posts visible on a sliding scale from \u201ceveryone\u201d to \u201conly me\u201d. That\u2019s increasingly important for Facebook, which has seen a reduction of 21% in \u201coriginal sharing\u201d users making posts about their own life. As people have become more aware of the downsides of sharing personal details publicly, it seems that they\u2019ve stopped sharing altogether.",

As a businessman, the league\u2019s former commissioner was a visionary, building a booming operation that now reaches around the globe. But on social issues he stumbled, creating policies that almost seemed designed to make a league of mostly African American players appear palatable to a white audience. It was Stern, after all, who 11 years ago created professional sports\u2019 first sideline dress code that he called \u201cbusiness casual\u201d.",

He is a jazz pianist who has appeared on 60 Minutes, has played for President Obama at the White House, was one of the youngest Grammy nominees in history, and has just released his second studio album, Countdown, which features three original compositions. But despite those achievements, he still enjoys the same sort of things that young boys do everywhere. \u201cI like the Transformers,\u201d he tells me when we meet in New York City. \u201cI like the leader Optimus Prime. I like the leader.",
        "\u2018This was once one of the dirtiest areas in East Germany,\u201d says S\u00f6ren, my tour guide from IBA Tours, as our bikes swoosh through the Lusatian Lake District. \u201cWhen I was growing up here, before the Wall fell, we never hung our laundry outside, and we never wore white socks, because we knew they wouldn\u2019t be white after a few minutes. The coal dust was everywhere, all the time. \u201d It\u2019s difficult to connect this information with the pristine landscape around us, all soaring pine forests, glistening lakes and immaculate asphalt cycle paths.",
        "A mobster who prosecutors contend knows the whereabouts of paintings stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner museum in Boston in the largest art heist in US history is near death, his attorney said on Saturday.

Following a recent investigation by the Observer, which found that Google\u2019s search engine prominently suggests websites and antisemitic writing, the Guardian has uncovered a dozen additional examples of biased search results. Google\u2019s search algorithm and its autocomplete function prioritize websites that, for example, declare that climate change is a hoax, being gay is a sin, and the Sandy Hook mass shooting never happened.",
        "Theo Walcott\u2019s shoulders slumped a little as the board was hoisted here. The winger stood in the middle of the pitch, hands on hips and disbelief etched across his brow, as he digested the fact his number was up just as he was contemplating plundering the his performance had deserved. His was a trudge to the touchline thereafter as the majority in the arena chorused their appreciation. That reception, and this saunter to the top of the group, should serve as consolation.",
