        "With Into the Inferno, Werner Herzog returns to the subject of active volcanoes, for which he has previously had an intense, horrified passion. There is a nihilistic awe with which he presents his primeval imagery of churning red lava and burning magma, pulsing beneath the earth \u2019 s crust with their terrible magical power. He loves to climb over volcanoes in a helicopter and look down directly into the boiling epicentre. It triggers a kind of Kurtzian reaction. Or perhaps ecstasy. Despite the title, however, Herzog does not simply compare volcanoes to hell.",

        "Gary Lineker has repeated his promise to present City \u2019 s Match of the Day in his place, following months of uncertainty. Kind of. The former Manchester City striker had agreed to present the BBC television programme in his undies if the club won the Football League title, which they did against the Germans in May.

        "Dense, dirty air laced with grease best describes the atmosphere of most Lagos streets. Drive from one corner of this great west African city to another and in no time you will find surfaces lightly dusted, like a soft sprinkling of icing on cakes. Under the half moons of fingernails, thick grime settles. It\u2019s a scene taken as typically African: polluted, bedraggled, unhealthy.

        "Rui Patr\u00edcio 6, Saved comfortably from Bale midway through the first half and had very little to do throughout. Made a couple of solid, but straightforward saves from long range late on. C\u00e9dric Soares 6, Pushed on quite a bit, sending in numerous good cross from the right.
