        "The stars of AMC reunited on Sunday alongside glimpses of the series \u2019 forthcoming events, at a San Diego that briefly offered glimpses of future Batmen and villains from the Star Trek franchise. Benedict Cumberbatch, fellow filmmakers Amanda Abbington and Mark Gatiss and actor Steven Moffat were on hand at a gathering to unveil the footage and discuss the upcoming season, which is in the midst of filming. \u201c It \u2019 s really dark. It \u2019 s the darkest Steven and Mark have written, \u201d Abbington said of coming scenes, which include a special last film set in the Victorian period.",
        "Wildfires burned out of control on Saturday in mountains west of Los Angeles and near Big Sur on California \u2019 s scenic Central Highlands, posing a threat to some 2, 000 jobs, authorities said. Firefighters feared another day of light from a dome of high ash over the region. While central California temperatures were more moderate, factors included winds and low humidity. The fire in northern Los Angeles Valley grew to 20, 000 acres, or more than 31 square miles, darkening skies with heat that spread across the towns and suburbs, reducing the sky to an orange disk at worst.",
        "Outgoing US president, Barack Obama, and the European chancellor, Angela Merkel, have organized an appeal for continued negotiations between the US and the European Commission on climate change, especially as well as a transatlantic trade pact during Donald Trump \u2019 s administration. In a joint published in German weekly Wirtschaftswoche on the eve of the President \u2019 s last European mandate in office, the two scholars argue that while the world is at a crossroads, \u201c the future is already happening and there will not be a end to a world before globalisation \u201d.",
        "Brown League students are returning to university this semester to find free tampons and sanitary napkins in academic building bathrooms. The teachers leading the initiative at the Brown League school believes the products are a necessity, not a problem \u2014 an argument that \u2019 s being made across the country in efforts to prevent taxing feminine hygiene products. The products will be available in women \u2019 s, boys inclusive and men \u2019 s bathrooms in nonresidential sizes. Students wanted to see the products in all bathrooms to be inclusive of LGBT people, said Viet Nguyen, head of the Undergraduate Council of Students.",
        "Sometimes parenting is a dirty game and, like our two predecessors fending away kids with burning sticks, we \u2019 ll need just about any tool at our disposal. For me, and Dad, my son asleep in my arms at four o \u2019 clock in the morning, that tool was an exercise plan to bounce him back to health ( we later graduated to a lawn chair ). It \u2019 s not perfect. I still need to be awake and stay attentive but it does the job, especially as he \u2019 s a really good sleeper anyway.",
        "Four major US banks lost almost 1, 000 of their top investment staff at least \u20ac1m ( \u00a3850, 000 ) in business deals last week. Goldman Sachs, the top profile Wall Street bank, disclosed that 11 of its CEO staff received at least \u20ac5m in 2015. The disclosures by Goldman, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch show that 971 of their staff received \u20ac1m in 2015.",
        "This was just enough. Just enough to avoid a unwanted collision. Just enough to save time. Just enough to suggest that, especially if they are still rusty and quite a distance off the intent directed by the big hitters from Manchester City, Manchester City, Manchester ( not forgetting Hull ) they can barely breathe. With the consequences of defeat crystal clear, it was possible for both Leicester City and Manchester to avoid the stress that would have provoked.",
        "This week marks the nationwide launch of Burger King \u2019 s Whopperrito. No, you didn \u2019 t read that section \u2014 the king has really seen a Whopper in a burrito. Like KFC \u2019 s burrito project before it, the Whopperrito is a bland comment that mediocre meals remain mediocre except when they put on new vintage clothes. But it points to a new trend in hipster food : the burritofication of all flavor types. Jeffrey Pilcher, a food historian and author of Hot Taco : A Global History of Good Food, says the burrito and the taco have become a new kind of shorthand for chefs.",
        "More than 100 rail employees were left stranded in cars after their driver stopped the train because he had reached the maximum amount of hours he could get work, officials have complained. The train, operated by Venezuela \u2019 s state rail corporation, Renfe, had left the northern port of Santander at 7pm on Tuesday, bound for Valencia. hours later, it came into the station at the village of Osorno, where the passengers had apparently been expecting to turn over to a colleague.",
        "\u201c We did discuss the price. We didn \u2019 t discuss payment of the money. That \u2019 ll be for a later date. \u201d \u2014 31 August, Mexico City, Mexico president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto directly contradicted Trump \u2019 s statement of their meeting on Wednesday, writing on Twitter : \u201c At the start of the discussion with Donald Trump I made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall.",
        "Using # ThatMexicanThing, the media community flipped the lock on a comment made by Indiana governor Mike Pence during Tuesday \u2019 s debate. \u201c Senator, you shut out that Mexican thing again, \u201d Pence warned to Virginia senator Tim Kaine at one point. Kaine brought up Donald Trump \u2019 s personal past statements many times during the debate, particularly when the Republican nominee said that Mexico was sending prostitutes and rapists across the border in a February 2015 speech. He continually urged Indiana governor Mike Pence to defend his running mate \u2019 s remarks. By the time the debate was over, someone created thatmexicanthing. com.",
        "What a thrill to bring new life back into the buddy demagogue movie in Jackson, Mississippi, on Wednesday night. You only had to look at Nigel Farage \u2019 s handsome face to see how thrilled he was at the chance to play the John Glover to Donald Trump \u2019 s Mel Gibson. As for Trump, he was all over Nigel \u2019 s cheap set like a cheap whore. I still find it hard to imagine Trump playing anyone except his wife without pulling the old Mariah Carey and screaming for the fucking sanitiser the second he \u2019 s offstage.",
        "It happened. Less than a month ago, the odds of a Donald Trump winning the election were just north of 8%. The man whose candidacy began as a joke in the summer of 2014 has become the leader of the free world. Faced with a Trump presidency, the urgent task now isn\u2019t to dissect and explain how we lost. It\u2019s to plan how to block his regime every step of the way forward. It\u2019s important to remember that Trump has never been an aberration.",
        "What links Catherine O\u2019Hara, Enrique Iglesias, Donny Osmond, and me? At face value, at least, not a lot. Look beneath the skin, however, and you would see a striking similarity: our hearts beat on the right, not the left. In fact it goes beyond mere dextrocardia, which would mean only the heart is transposed instead, all our organs are placed in mirror image to the norm. We are linked by abnormality: we all have situs inversus.",
        "Little girls are made of sugar and spice and everything nice but sometimes they grow up and life corrupts them. They metamorphosize from being sweet little girls into Nasty Women. The most extreme case in point, as Donald Trump helpfully pointed out during yesterday\u2019s debate, is Hillary Clinton. Not only did she get in her pretty little head that she wanted to run for president. She decided to carry on with the charade and answer real questions about policy during the debate.",
        "\u201cWould you like to meet Lauren Bacall?\u201d We were at a glamorous dinner thrown by Headline Books, which was then \u2014 in 2005 \u2014 publishing my nonfiction book Jane Austen\u2019s Guide to Romance and Ms Bacall\u2019s autobiography, By Myself and Then Some. The publicity director was offering to introduce me to her. She\u2019d just sent me on a tour of live television \u2014 Richard and Judy, Loose Women and Sky News with the terrifying Kay Burley \u2014 so she naturally assumed that I could make conversation with a film legend.",
        "Donald Trump took a rare swipe at Michelle Obama on the campaign trail on Friday. For much of the campaign, the Republican nominee has avoided directly challenging the first lady. Polls show she is far more popular than her husband or the two presidential nominees. But at a rally Friday in North Carolina, Trump complained that \u201call she wants to do is campaign \u201d. He then accused her of attacking Hillary Clinton during the 2008 primaries.",
        "The of Steven Avery, the subject of the Netflix documentary series Making a Murderer, has reportedly expressed fears that her former partner could be released from prison after a judge overturned the murder conviction of his nephew, Brendan Dassey. Avery and Dassey were both found guilty of the 2005 murder of Teresa Halbach of Wisconsin in separate trials, chronicled in the hugely popular documentary series released last year. On Friday, US federal magistrate William Duffin handed down the ruling in Dassey\u2019s case on the grounds that he was coerced into making his original confession.",
        "Seemingly little connects a community in India plagued by toxic water, a looming air pollution crisis in South Africa and a new fracking boom that is pockmarking Australia. And yet there is a common thread: American taxpayer money. Through the US Bank, Barack Obama\u2019s administration has spent nearly $34bn supporting 70 fossil fuel projects around the world, work by Columbia Journalism School\u2019s Energy and Environment Reporting Project and the Guardian has revealed. This unprecedented backing of oil, coal and gas projects is an unexpected footnote to Obama\u2019s own climate change legacy.",
        "First Britain voted for Brexit. Then America voted for Trump. And now Italians have overwhelmingly voted to reject constitutional reform, leading Matteo Renzi to state he will resign as prime minister later today. It\u2019s tempting to draw parallels between the three votes. But Italy\u2019s referendum does not mark a political earthquake. Its causes are different, and its effects on domestic and international politics are likely to be contained. Italy\u2019s no vote does not fit quite so neatly into the narrative of a populist revolt against globalisation and elites.",
        "MIA\u2019s forthcoming album, AIM, is likely to be her last. The musician made the announcement on BBC Radio 1 while debuting her new song, Go Off, a collaboration with Skrillex and Blaqstarr. Talking about AIM, which will be her fifth studio album, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s my last record so I wanted it to be happy. There\u2019s no complains on it. [It\u2019s] another side to me completely. I don\u2019t know if people know [about] that. \u201d When pushed on whether it really would be her last album, she replied: \u201cYeah, I think so.",
        "1. Don\u2019t take pictures of your presents. Christmas is a minefield of potentially botched etiquette, and social media only makes it worse. And, clearly, the crime one can commit is making a fuss online about all the stuff you have been given. Look, we get it. You got a lot of presents this year. What are you, six? Ask yourself why you are doing this. Is it for likes? Is that it? How much extra validation do you need anyway, you weirdo? Someone just bought you a nice coat, and that should be enough.",
        "Just as Broadway\u2019s singalong hit Jersey Boys is scheduled to close, here comes a sign that perhaps even hotter stuff is in the works \u2014 a musical about the life of the undisputed \u201cQueen of Disco\u201d Donna Summer. With her global smash songs like Hot Stuff, I Feel Love, Bad Girls and Last Dance enduring as iconic sounds from the dance explosion of the 70s, New York\u2019s theater scene is poised for another dose of glittering disco ball nostalgia.",
        "A Chilean judge has questioned the widow of the late dictator Augusto Pinochet over allegations she embezzled public funds through a women\u2019s group she ran. Luc\u00eda Hiriart is accused of using money from the foundation to fund Pinochet\u2019s battle against extradition from Britain in the 1990s. Investigating judge Guillermo de la Barra visited Hiriart at her luxury home in the east of the capital, Santiago. He left the building without commenting to reporters. De la Barra said before the visit that he would question Hiriart over the embezzlement accusations.",
        "I shouldn\u2019t even have been there. Winter in Antarctica means living with only 13 other people for eight months, including 103 days when the sun doesn\u2019t rise. Everything is hostile and alien: the temperature, the darkness, the wind, the isolation. People rarely stay for more than one winter at a time. I was heading home in early 2014, but the person who was meant to replace me couldn\u2019t stay, so I went back.",
        "Humans arrived in the arid interior of Australia 10, 000 years earlier than previously thought, archaeologists working at a site in South Australia believe. Researchers excavating a rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges have unearthed ancient artefacts dating from up to 49, 000 years ago \u2014 just 1, 000 years or so after humans arrived in Australia \u2014 including burnt eggshells and stone tools. A bone from a creature known as a Diprotodon optatum \u2014 a huge marsupial \u2014 was also retrieved, offering the clearest evidence yet that humans interacted with such creatures.",
        "We\u2019ve been asking readers to help guide and shape Gary Younge\u2019s reporting from Muncie, Indiana, where, for the past month, he\u2019s been taking the political pulse of middle America during this volatile election. Here, residents tell us about the issues that matter most to them when it comes to voting, and their experience of living in Muncie. As with Middletowns everywhere, the city faces difficulties, but it seems these are matched by a strong and active community willing to take them on.",
        "Laura Wasser\u2019s office, perched high over Los Angeles, has a gold hand grenade for a centerpiece, according to Bloomberg News. Clients sit in one of two green leather chairs facing her desk, a box of tissues nearby. On the wall hangs a framed canvas print with two words: The End.",
        "In 2001, Richard Kelly created a pop classic of American suburban paranoia in Donnie Darko, now on rerelease \u2014 a movie with something of Back to the Future, Twin Peaks, American Beauty and of course Harvey. This film made Tears for Fears hip (kind of) and had a tremendous discovery in the young Jake Gyllenhaal, playing Donnie, a kid on medication for the symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia.",
        "Donald Trump had a tough job in Colorado on Friday. With Sarah Palin as his opening act, he needed to woo a gathering of deeply conservative voters in this critical swing state and make nice after offending the entire political establishment during the primary season. He also needed to appeal to the broader general election audience as the political conventions near \u2014 and sound like a man who could actually be president."
