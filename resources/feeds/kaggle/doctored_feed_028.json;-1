        "Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has dismissed Lyndon Johnson \u2019 s proposal that Europe might enjoy rights to the European single markets and restrict immigration at the same time, telling German leaders the UK would receive no special favours. In a speech to the Bundestag, Merkel stated negotiations over Britain \u2019 s future would not be a \u201c exercise \u201d. To parliament, she warned that the UK government should be under no illusions over the decisions that would be made. \u201c We will make sure that negotiations will not be carried out as a exercise.",
        "The marginalia of US gang lore is scrawled thick with surprise people who burst from obscurity only to vanish as quickly as they arrived. The roll of names felt like the answer question to a pub quiz \u2014 Lee Mackey III, Bob Gadja, Mike Nicolette, Olin Williams, Justin Hicks \u2014 improbable leaders all, each of whom plummeted back into relative anonymity.",
        "Not long afterwards, I took my father to a movie premiere to celebrate his 60th birthday. I got to do this because I am a writer and artist, and I lead a strange, unusual life in which I occasionally get to stand within striking distance of talented performers of great renown and excellent musical structure. We stood amidst the upscale crowd in Manhattan, like overgrown kids from Jersey in matching shoes from Nordstrom Rack. I pointed out Miss Jenner and explained who she was. I pointed out David Ostrovsky and explained who he was ( this took even longer ).",
        "When Judge Anthony Kennedy was put forward for the supreme court by Governor Ronald Reagan, whose previous two offers had been rejected, he was asked whether he had ever smoked cannabis. \u201c No, \u201d he insisted, \u201c firmly no. \u201d Kennedy was a safe pair of boots. But in the just ended term, followed by the death of fellow President and Reagan appointee Antonin Scalia, he has emerged as the major figure and surprised us by tilting America \u2019 s federal court to the left.",
        "The evacuation of East Aleppo has been completed, bringing to a close a key point in the Syrian rebellion against the city \u2019 s president, Bashar. About 4, 000 rebel troops and civilians left the city on Thursday, the last person remaining in the shrunken patch of Aleppo still nominally occupied by the opposition in the city. The rebel army said it had retaken Aleppo entirely and brought \u201c soldiers and safety \u201d back to the capital. The last evacuations bring the total number of people who have left east Aleppo in the last week to a little over 40, 000.",
        "Bowie was the new music I really lived with. I \u2019 m 19, so wasn \u2019 t around when he arrived, but he still felt modern to me \u2014 the way he challenged definitions, his voice, the way he was a figure of for characters who don \u2019 t feel represented, as well as playing a character. After my father texted to tell me that he had died, I got into the shower and cried. I suppose I was crying because it meant I would never get a chance to tell anyone how important he \u2019 d been to us.",
        "We \u2019 ve started a web blog to cover the details on the attack and investigation into the chief suspect. According to de Maizi\u00e8re, the suspect, Naved B, spoke Balochi, one of five major languages spoken in Afghanistan. De Maizi\u00e8re said there had been investigators questioning him in the past because no evidence could be found who speaks the language. De Maizi\u00e8re also confirms that the man who has been questioned on suspicion of carrying out the murder has denied the charges. The missing man is from Pakistan, and died in Germany on 31 December 2015.",
        "There \u2019 s no point far from it \u2014 Donald Trump \u2019 s administration should give us all hope for our future and the future of our countries. The chances of successfully mitigating climate change and holding global temperature increases to below a manageable 1. 5 percent rise has nosedived. Trump, a guy who believes that climate change is a \u201c hoax \u201d wants to pull the world out of the Paris climate conference. Even if that ends up buying time, he can decimate US weather agencies engaged in research to move to a greener society.",
        "Waking up before the alarm went off can be irritating, especially when there \u2019 s still nearly 90 years to go until you get to get out of bed. This is the moment in which Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt find themselves in the Netflix adventure Passengers, when they are roused prematurely by a system malfunction a quarter of the way into their journey through outer space. At least there is one thing on board their flight that will assuage any intergalactic disorientation : an offbeat British character pilot.",
        "A spate of racist behaviour has been reported by US librarians in the wake of the presidential election. According to data gathered by the Academic Libraries Association ( ALA ) copies of the Qur \u2019 an and books about Islam have been defaced with swastikas and hate speech at universities across the US. In the following incident, four years after the election of Donald Trump, a man attempted to deliberately remove a student \u2019 s hijab as she stood in the library of the University of New Mexico.",
        "Two protesters have been charged in Thailand for narrowing down voter lists for a possible upcoming referendum, as the military junta goes to increasingly considerable lengths to muzzle dissent. The junta is yet to see its draft bill passed in the referendum on 7 October and has outlawed critical discussion of the referendum with a prison sentence. Campaigning of any day is also banned and authorities have already arrested or sentenced scores of people for passing out critical leaflets or wearing Vote No.",
        "I am that person at a party, desperately following the occasional tray of vegetarian canapes around, managing to sneak a second mouthful before I even noticed. I can \u2019 t count the number of parties I have left a bit bleary because there just wasn \u2019 t anything to eat. As far as I am concerned, where there \u2019 s drink, there should be food \u2014 for everyone. So I have three tasks I keep in mind when I am buying food for a party. While it \u2019 s simple to cater to all tastes and whims, I prefer food that I hope almost everyone can eat.",
        "The family of a man killed when his Tesla hit a highway while under the control of its autopilot function must have legal grounds to sue the company, legal courts say. Joshua Smith died on 7 May after his Audi S hit the side of a car while in \u201c autopilot \u201d mode, in the first ever death involving a car. Tesla \u2019 s system is not in fact fully autonomous \u2014 it is described in with traffic notices as \u201c cruise control \u201d and reminds drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel at all times.",
        "A gruesome scene in Spectre helped make the latest instalment in the James Bond franchise the most complained about film of 2015, British film censors have said. The offending scene, set in a villains\u2019 conference room, shows a henchman banging his victim\u2019s head on a table before getting to work on his eyes, and had been toned down before the film\u2019s release on the advice of the British Board of Film Classification. But that did not stop the arrival of 40 complaints about the film\u2019s age rating, the highest number for any film last year, the BBFC said.",
        "The UFC has so much going for them right now by building a new mainstream audience with bigger stars and bigger events than ever before, so why do they feel the need to squelch the voices of journalists? By the middle of Saturday night\u2019s UFC 199, the organization was on a tremendous high, lining up a summer of huge events. They were on the verge of announcing that legendary fighter Brock Lesnar would return from a absence to fight in July\u2019s UFC 200.",
        "A Canadian man accused in a failed shopping mall massacre plot in the Atlantic Canadian city of Halifax pleaded guilty on Tuesday and was sentenced to 10 years in prison, a prosecution spokeswoman said. An American woman charged in the same case has pleaded not guilty and is expected to face trial in May, according to the court and prosecution. The two were accused of planning a mass murder and suicide at a shopping center. They were arrested at the Halifax airport in February after the woman arrived from Illinois, allegedly to carry out the massacre.",
        "As the rain began to fall, Brigid Day looked around the field of play, pausing for a moment. It was only a drizzle, she figured, but it wouldn\u2019t take much more than a light coating to lend a certain slickness to the playing surface. After all, Day mused, this was baseball. Except it wasn\u2019t baseball per se. Not as she had come to know it. This was base ball, the original game, from which today\u2019s modern version evolved. Bare bones. Minus the hoopla.",
        "President Donald Trump is set to give America\u2019s richest 1% an average annual tax cut of $214, 000 when he takes office, while more than eight million families with children are expected to suffer financially under his proposed tax plan. On the eve of the election, Trump promised to \u201cmassively cut taxes for the middle class, the forgotten people, the forgotten men and women of this country, who built our country\u201d.",
        "Barack Obama declared Louisiana a federal disaster zone on Sunday after historic flash floods in the state left at least six people dead and caused more than 20, 000 people to be rescued. The storm has put another 12, 000 people into temporary shelters, Governor John Bel Edwards said during a press conference. Residents were pulled from homes, flooded cars and hospitals across the southern portion of the state, he said.",
        "It is among the most venerable election rituals of the smartphone era: down the home stretch, a recording surfaces containing embarrassing audio of a candidate \u2019splaining politics to a room of rich, donors. In 2008, Barack Obama was caught talking in San Francisco about Rust Belt who \u201ccling\u201d to guns and Bibles. Four years later, Mitt Romney never recovered from his \u201chopeless 47%\u201d comments in Boca Raton. And last Friday splashed the arrival of Hillary Clinton\u2019s very own \u201cbasement tape\u201d recorded at a fundraiser in a tony Virginia suburb.",
        "The CEO of online loan company Lending Club, Renaud Laplanche, abruptly resigned Monday morning in the wake of an internal investigation around a $22m loan that was issued to an investor \u201cin contravention of the investor\u2019s express instructions\u201d according to a statement from the company. How exactly the loan contravened the instructions of the borrower was unclear from the statement, but that didn\u2019t stop the price of the company\u2019s stock from plummeting more than 25% when the US stock markets opened. Scott Sanborn, Lending Club\u2019s president, will continue as interim CEO.",
        "The first photographs have emerged of Australian senior Isis member, Neil Prakash, following his capture and imprisonment in Turkey. The photographs obtained by the Guardian show the accused terrorist with a face that has thinned noticeably since he appeared more than six months ago in publicity material as one of the extremist group\u2019s chief recruiters. Prakash, whom the Australian government believed had been killed in an airstrike in Iraq\u2019s second city, Mosul, in May, was arrested by Turkish border guards on 24 October, in the southern village of Inali, the Guardian has confirmed.",
        "The first day and night of the 2016 Republican national convention is complete. Here\u2019s what we learned: That\u2019s it for tonight. See you back here bright and early tomorrow. Thanks for all the comments. A number of lines in the robustly applauded speech delivered by Melania Trump at the Republican national convention on Monday night appear to have been lifted verbatim from a speech Michelle Obama delivered at the 2008 Democratic convention.",
        "After Turkey\u2019s failed coup, is President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s grip on power tighter than ever? According to conventional wisdom, yes. For a start, Erdo\u011fan did what four of his predecessors couldn\u2019t: he survived an attempted coup. The army\u2019s top leadership remained loyal, suggesting that Erdo\u011fan has largely succeeded in taming a high command that had made a veiled threat to topple his government as recently as 2007. He also has the widespread backing of the police, many of whom stood up to the soldiers last Friday.",
        "My husband and I were married on a cold, overcast afternoon the day before New Year\u2019s Eve. Neither of us had imagined having a winter wedding, but we needed to marry by January in order to be posted together for our next assignment. We both work as diplomats, our lives divided into chunks of time separated by tours abroad. The timing of the wedding was not a drastic change of plans we had decided to marry within months of our first meeting.",
        "Thousands of Muhammad Ali\u2019s admirers, from the unknown to the powerful, packed a Louisville arena on Friday to honor the great boxer and humanitarian. They followed a script outlined by Ali himself, and the service bore his signature dedication to openness and inclusion. Family, famous friends, imams, pastors, rabbis and a former president of the United States took turns at the podium, as did black and white, young and old.",
        "People playing the popular smartphone game Pok\u00e9mon Go in Bosnia have been urged to avoid areas littered with unexploded mines left over from the 1990s conflict. \u201cToday we received information that some users of the Pok\u00e9mon Go app in Bosnia were going to places which are a risk for (unexploded) mines, in search of a pokemon,\u201d the NGO Posavina bez mina said on its Facebook page. \u201cCitizens are urged no to do so, to respect demarcation signs of dangerous mine fields and not to go into unknown areas,\u201d it added.",
        "The biggest US police union is pressing Amazon to follow Walmart and remove from sale a shirt that seeks profit in relation to the Black Lives Matter protest movement. The shirt, which carries the words \u201cBulletproof: Black Lives Matter\u201d was removed from online sale by Walmart on Thursday, after the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) said it was \u201coffensive\u201d. In an open letter, FOP president Chuck Canterbury appealed to Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos to support the FOP in \u201cincreasing the bonds of trust between the men and women of law enforcement and the communities they serve\u201d.",
        "Samer remembers the size of the small hatch near the bottom of his cell door because he was regularly forced to squeeze his head through it. The prison guards would then straighten it out, so his throat was pressed against the edge of the hatch, and jump on his head with all their weight, until blood started flowing across the floor.",
        "Comic book adaptations usually fall into one of two clearly defined categories: one, work that angers the original fanbase, and two, the ones that don\u2019t. There are a few \u2014 very few \u2014 exceptions which manage to make pretty big changes from the source material but still keep the fans on board. The Walking Dead always changes up the big deaths from the comics, which the fans are broadly happy with, as it keeps them guessing."
