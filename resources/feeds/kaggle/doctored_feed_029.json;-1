        "Since the success of the buzz surrounding Steve Feig \u2019 s new Ghostbusters has focused on the truth about gender, we haven \u2019 t spent much time praising the strength of leads. Kristen Wiig has largely stuck to supporting roles since breaking out in 2011 \u2019 s Bridesmaids, but apparently the awkward academic with a tragic past in this week \u2019 s lowest budget comedy brings her back to the multiplex. The film might underwhelm in parts but she remains a huge comic presence nonetheless. But what have been her greatest roles?",
        "Ramen noodles are overtaking tobacco as the most powerful currency in US society, according a new story released on Monday. A new report by Michael a research candidate in the University of Minnesota \u2019 s school of sociology, mentioned the decline in quality and amount of food available in Texas due to has made ramen noodles a popular commodity. \u201c [ Ramen ] is easy to grow and it \u2019 s high in calories, \u201d said. \u201c A lot of them, they spend their days reading and exercising and they don \u2019 t have enough energy to do these jobs.",
        "In his landmark essay, Los Angeles : the City of Four Ecologies, Reyner Banham wrote : \u201c I choose to drive in order to reach Los Angeles in the wild \u201d \u2014 implying that in order to preserve this city, one could do so from the friendly confines of an automobile. I pondered this fact while sitting in traffic on my way to the Memorial Coliseum to see the Rams \u2019 return to work. What the hell do I understand driving at the bumper of a Nissan Ultima?",
        "The battle of the brash billionaires is on. Entrepreneur David Cuban used Donald Trump \u2019 s braggadocio to make the run for electing Hillary Clinton during a rally in his native Pittsburgh on television. \u201c Leadership is not yelling, and arrogant and intimidating, \u201d said Cuban, the owner of the NBA \u2019 s Dallas Mavericks and a panelist on ABC \u2019 s Shark Tank. \u201c People like that in America are called a jagoff, \u201d he added, using pejorative Pittsburgh slang. \u201c Is there any bigger jagoff in the world than Donald Trump? \u201d The endorsement ends the discussion over who the independent would endorse.",
        "Military police have shot pepper spray at demonstrators who broke down barrier walls outside a meeting in Rio de Janeiro where organizers were considering austerity measures to deal with a deepening financial crisis that has kept thousands of public bills from being paid. The Brazilian Federal government sent thousands of military police to Angola after a similar protest previous week became violent. Wielding shields and pepper spray guns, police broke lines in front of the constituent assembly of Rio de Janeiro state. Over two hours, protesters broke fences in various ways in attempts to get control.",
        "According to a private sidebar of shame, there \u2019 s a new in town. \u201c Leaving his legs open and his feet placed on the carpet as he leans on the bed, Tom confidently shows off every line of his muscular physique, \u201d breathes the caption, channelling Rita Skeeter after a vat of chicken fly. Actor and Video Apparent Tom Hiddleston \u2019 s \u201c racy photoshoot \u201d is for esteemed fashion mag stars, and the actor is pictured lounging about in nothing but a pair of white striped boxers, legs bent, gazing longingly at the camera like Oscar Wilde \u2019 s Golden Bosie.",
        "An actor \u2019 s work is hard : it \u2019 s just one character after another, and you have to grow a bit to deal with all the rejection. For Bird, however, things go a little differently : she was hired to the Alphabet Kidz agency just before her sixth season and two weeks later beat hundreds of other female actors to land the starring role in a \u00a31. 4bn show. She is the mother of Peppa Pig, the eponymous piglet who likes dressing up and jumping in muddy puddles.",
        "Migraine sufferers have a different form of gut bacteria that could make them more sensitive to certain foods, scientists have said. The study offers a strong explanation for why some people are more sensitive to debilitating headaches and why some foods appear to function as triggers for migraines. The research showed that migraine sufferers had high levels of bacteria that are known to be involved in processing nitrates, which are also found in processed meats, leafy fruits and some wines.",
        "A boy in hospital is in critical condition after being shot in the crossfire of a gun battle that left at least four others injured. The boy, Mahaj Brown, was hit with at least 10 rounds, but is expected to recover minor wounds to his left thigh and chest. Police reported more than 50 shell casings have been recovered from what they described as a \u201c running gun battle \u201d. Multiple buildings and structures were also damaged in the storm.",
        "Evan McMullin is considering running for president of the United States of America. But before yesterday morning, about 135 people had heard of him, or at least followed him on foot. That \u2019 s probably enough support to get him elected president of his homeowner \u2019 s association. His following blossomed quickly to nearly 33, 000 \u2014 not quite enough to get him elected to the city board in Provo, Utah. That \u2019 s where he \u2019 s from, according to his Wikipedia page, which magically clicked along with his announcement.",
        "It was late 1958, someone was firing rockets into the air, and Lee Lockwood was bored. Sitting at Cape Canaveral with his camera in hand, Lockwood watched wearily as the latest in humanity \u2019 s attempts to best mankind in the space race fizzled out, descending from the sky. He wasn \u2019 t alone other guys were around, also itching for a real job. One stood up : had the fellers seen the latest happenings in Washington? It sure looked like a revolution was coming. That settled it : Lockwood boarded a plane to Mars.",
        "Jessica Williams, one of the few recognizable stars on The Daily Show with Noah Noah, announced on Twitter that she is leaving after Thursday \u2019 s broadcast. She \u2019 s been with the show for four years after joining at age 22 and became one of the biggest and fastest platforms for emerging women in television. Now, like Steve Carell, Stephen Colbert and Colin Corddry, she \u2019 s moving on to bigger and better things. Williams left the show two days after the website Jezebel created a firestorm when it found out how few female writers and other people worked at The Daily Show.",
        "In a searing, eloquent essay on living with schizophrenia, Deborah Danner agonized over the deaths of mentally ill people like her at the hands of police. Less than five years later, she became part of that toll. A police sergeant, who was called because Danner was in distress, fatally shot her Tuesday in her Bronx apartment after she went at him with a baseball bat, police said. With the mayor saying the sergeant failed to follow his training in handling mentally ill people, Danner\u2019s death seems to echo a scenario she dreaded in a 2012 essay.",
        "Brazil\u2019s most recognisable celebrity Pel\u00e9 has pulled out of the Rio 2016 opening ceremony just hours before it was due to begin, but the director insisted this would not detract from a show that aims to be about a lot more than sport. Over the past two years, filmmaker Fernando Meirelles has grown accustomed to setbacks as he has prepared for Friday night\u2019s performance amid political and economic turmoil in Brazil.",
        "No one knows what damage a Donald Trump administration will wreak on America and the world. But there are many reasons to worry. Trump once proposed banning Muslims and has expressed support for a registry of Muslims in America. He has repeatedly promised to build a wall between Mexico and the United States and deport millions of undocumented people. He has called for the end of Obamacare rejects climate change and said abortion laws should be up to the states to decide. The list goes on and on.",
        "After all the talk about \u201cWhat is Wrong With Steph Curry,\u201d it felt almost inevitable that he would have his best game of the Finals. Curry racked up 38 points, plus 6 assists and 5 rebounds. When Curry is playing like this, the Warriors are very difficult to beat, although the Cavaliers should be credited for staying in this game as long as they did. Needless to say, Cleveland have a very tall task ahead of them, and zero margin of error, if they want to come back and win this series now.",
        "Is Pedro Almod\u00f3var getting more respectable? You might say so. When the international film scene first caught up with the Spanish in the late 80s, he had already been notorious in Spain for nearly a decade with his films inspired by low life and high melodrama \u2014 lurid, cheerfully scandalous, irrepressibly polysexual stories of porn stars, punk rockers, serial killers and rebel nuns. Now, 20 features into his career, Almod\u00f3var has long been recognised as a European classic, with his films since the including All About My Mother and Volver, largely turning away from outrage and perversity.",
        "The experience of death, which had bound them together a quarter of a century ago, unexpectedly reunited them on an unseasonably warm January afternoon in 2013. They made their way down East 32nd Street in Manhattan just after two o\u2019clock, wending sedately towards the stark black doorway of the Cutting Room, a performance space hosting the memorial service for Spencer Cox, one of the country\u2019s most recognisable Aids activists. Long before the glass doors swung open, a line stretched down the block.",
        "Tonight, tech billionaire Peter Thiel will speak at the Republican national convention and make his case for why Donald Trump should be the next president of the United States. Most of the media is baffled by Thiel\u2019s endorsement. And it\u2019s true that at first glance the two men aren\u2019t an obvious match. Trump is an authoritarian populist who promises to abolish free trade. Thiel is a libertarian who worships capitalism. Thiel is also one of the most powerful people in Silicon Valley \u2014 and Silicon Valley hates Trump. So why would Thiel embrace Trump?",
        "You can almost feel the dread coming from Detroit this morning. This is a familiar sensation for Lions fans, after all. Their team has never been to a Super Bowl, has won just one playoff game in 59 years and last celebrated a division title in 1993. People want to talk about the suffering in Cleveland, but you can\u2019t talk about misery without understanding the darkness that has been the NFL in Detroit. On Sunday the Lions practically held the NFC North title in their hands.",
        "The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, nestled atop a majestic peak in the southern California mountains near Los Angeles, hosts many monuments to Reagan\u2019s politics and achievements. Statues portray him riding a horse in triumph or genially waving to the tour groups waiting to see his museum. An actual Air Force One plane is on permanent display. Children play on a concrete barrier freshened up by graffiti of a butterfly with pink wings, once a piece of the Berlin Wall.",
        "The defamation trial against Rolling Stone drew to a close on Tuesday, as attorneys clashed over whether the author of the magazine\u2019s discredited story of a gang rape was an reporter or a dupe. Before they adjourned, attorneys for the plaintiff excoriated Rolling Stone for willfully ignoring any facts that might have contradicted its preconceived notions of the story. \u201cOnce they decided what the article was going to be about, it didn\u2019t matter what the facts were,\u201d said Tom Clare, an attorney for a former University of Virginia dean who is suing the magazine for nearly $8m.",
        "are set to lose another of their number \u2014 the fourth core member of the group in two years. Bassist Cliff Williams, who joined in 1978 has said that after the band\u2019s Rock or Bust tour ends, \u201cI\u2019m backing off of touring and recording. \u201d Williams, 66, was talking to Gulfshore News, a Florida paper, in a feature about rock stars who live in southwest Florida. \u201cIt\u2019s been what I\u2019ve known for the past 40 years, but after this tour I\u2019m backing off of touring and recording,\u201d he said.",
        "Serena Williams, on the eve of her match against Svetlana Kuznetsova here, described every defeat she suffers as \u201cmajor international news\u201d. It was ultimately a case, then, of nothing to report. Move on, please. Focus on something more interesting than the champion simply grinding another opponent into the dust. That may be somewhat harsh on Kuznetsova, who before the rain delay that forced the players to leave Centre Court for close to half an hour was well and truly in this contest, even breaking Williams to lead in the first set.",
        "Full of new star power \u2014 and dominant on the inside \u2014 the US men\u2019s basketball team opened their bid for a third straight Olympic gold medal Friday night with a exhibition romp over Argentina. It was also the first time Kevin Durant played together with his new Golden State Warriors Draymond Green and Klay Thompson. A game that was over almost before it began showed the US have to improve their shooting and conditioning.",
        "John Glenn, who has died aged 95, was the first American to orbit the Earth and later the oldest person ever to be sent into space. During his long career he transformed himself from a highly decorated combat pilot and astronaut \u2014 one of the \u201cMercury Seven\u201d group of military test pilots selected in 1959 by Nasa to become America\u2019s first astronauts \u2014 into one of his country\u2019s and most effective senators.",
        "In the classic arcade game automated \u201cmoles\u201d pop up faster and faster, while the increasingly overwhelmed player attempts to beat them back down with a cushioned mallet. The political version of that game looks a lot like the recent controversy over the price of EpiPens. Since buying up the exclusive rights to the EpiPen in 2007, the pharmaceutical company Mylan has increased the price of this medication more than 400%. The move sparked outrage, with most patients and politicians turning their ire on the easiest target: the company itself. Easy \u2014 but wrong.",
        "Authorities perplexed as more than 100 members of clan that has almost no contact with outsiders threaten to cross river",
        "Vladimir Putin has cancelled a visit to Paris after the Kremlin accused France of seeking to humiliate the Russian leader. Moscow announced on Tuesday morning that the planned trip was off, hours after the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, said Russia could face war crimes charges over its bombardment of Aleppo, Syria\u2019s second largest city. France is furious at Moscow\u2019s veto of a French resolution at the UN calling for an immediate halt to Russian bombing of Aleppo.",
        "The United States men\u2019s basketball team saved their best for last, capping an occasionally precarious Olympic tournament with a rout of Serbia to capture yet another gold medal in the final event of the Rio Games. Kevin Durant poured in a 30 points \u2014 matching his total from the gold medal game four years ago in London \u2014 as the US team overcame a punchless opening with suffocating defense to run away before a lively crowd of 10, 658 at Carioca Arena 1."
