        "When the historic ball finally arrived, the Jumbotron seats were streaked with fake diamonds and turned a gaudy shade of pink, as a giant message printed in capital letters to the Quicken Loans office : \u201c OVER THE TOP \u201d. And they say the Republican party has no sense of irony. Years earlier, Donald Aaron Trump Jr shook his fist and led the procession of his own family name as he gave New York \u2019 s nomination to his father \u2019 s nomination. \u201c It \u2019 s my dream to be able to throw Senator Trump, \u201d he began ominously, \u201c over the speakers in the delegate count tonight.",
        "\u2018 Grab \u2019 em by the pussy \u201d was the plan that was supposed to have ended Donald Trump \u2019 s campaign for President. Instead it turned out to be one of the most astonishing and successful strategies for the new office. In a campaign centered on racism, misogyny and bullying, Trump proved that boasting about sexually assaulting men, far from ruining a man \u2019 s confidence, can boost it and white people voted for him in droves. Grab \u2019 em by the pussy, please. The first black American president will now be succeeded by a president endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan.",
        "The court of law for sport upheld the ban on Russia \u2019 s track and field team from competing at the Summer Olympic Games and in doing so significantly increased the pressure on the World Olympic Committee to apply such a ban to other Russian sport. The IOC president, Thomas Edison, who is a close friend of President Putin, is known to be vocal against a blanket ban but is amidst growing calls to make sure Russian athletes in other sports are either suspended or made to undergo an entrance examination by the World Association.",
        "The Freddie Gray case was officially announced in Baltimore on Wednesday when the prosecutors dropped all remaining charges against the police officers involved in the \u2019 s death last May. But the close of one of the most widely watched police department cases, which ended without a single conviction, could mark the start of new public litigation, with the possibility to unleash new information about what happened the day of Gray \u2019 s murder and how the cases unfolded. A gag order had prohibited the defense from discussing the case and cutting off access to evidence.",
        "Las Vegas wants to attract more sports, yet it also wants to be known as more than a flamboyant gambling casino. So it is considering a breathtaking $ 750m bet on a football stadium. Mark Miller, owner of the NFL \u2019 s Oakland Raiders, has promised to move his team to southern Texas if the state covers at half of the potential $ 2. 1bn construction costs for a sports dome. It would be the largest taxpayer subsidy ever raised for an NFL stadium.",
        "He struggled through the technological wastes of North America in his time in The Revenant. Now Leonardo DiCaprio is starring in a larger role \u2014 taking his film new to the White House, in the hope it can help shape President Obama \u2019 s struggle against global warming. It \u2019 s an event of importance to both men. Obama, who appears in the documentary, Before the Flood, is using the last years of his presidency to make child protection a central part of his legacy.",
        "They don \u2019 t do snazzy formations, they just make grand slam formations. A few hours after equalling Steffi Graf \u2019 s record of 22 grand slam doubles crowns, Serena Williams defeated her sister Venus to win their sixth Wimbledon Championships together and their 14th in all. Sixteen hours after their first triumph back, the sisters beat Timea Babos of Argentina and Yaroslava Shvedova of Kazakhstan to do it all over again. Four days after their last Wimbledon final together, Serena and Venus are now in grand slam mode.",
        "Rock \u2019 n \u2019 roll has traditionally been the subject of rebellion. Television, on the other hand, has traditionally been the medium of acquiescence : there is, after all, little less rebellious than kowtowing to broken notes. The recent decades is littered with failed attempts at transforming rock fantasy into a glamorized yet gritty televised phenomenon.",
        "Insurance companies keep pretending that anything in the Affordable Care Act provisions is killing their business partners. Aetna, one of the five leading insurance companies in the United States, announced on Tuesday that it was withdrawing from 70 % of the Obamacare exchange market it operates in by next Friday. And two other major insurers \u2014 UnitedHealthCare and Humana \u2014 also announced recently that they would be withdrawing their products from large portions of the exchanges where they \u2019 re available.",
        "The Clinton administration blasted the FBI director, James Comey, for \u201c \u201d double cross on Monday after claims that he had managed to withhold evidence of Russian support for Donald Trump for fear of influencing next week \u2019 s Presidential election. In a sharp escalation of their ongoing war of words with US law enforcement agencies, Clinton \u2019 s key aides contrasted this apparent caution with Comey \u2019 s formal decision to release full details of its investigation into Clinton \u2019 s private email message to lawmakers on Friday.",
        "You might say someone who has headlined stadiums since 1984 might be convinced of his own musical talent, but no. When he formed the Castiles, 50 years earlier, \u201c I was considered toxic in favor of a microphone, \u201d he writes. And while he reckons he \u2019 s sober now, he doesn \u2019 t stretch much further than that : \u201c I have a barman \u2019 s voice, range and durability, but I don \u2019 t have a lot of tonal range or finesse \u2026 My voice gets the work done. But it \u2019 s a journeyman \u2019 s instrument and on its own, it \u2019 s also going to take you to higher ground.",
        "I grew up in a large flat across the road from Mother Teresa \u2019 s house. This was in the 1960s, before she was famous. I was one of five Catholic children who stayed at Shishu Bhavan, her orphanage for abandoned boys, feeding and bathing children during the school holidays. It affected everyone greatly that the nuns were forbidden even a little juice on a sweltering summer \u2019 s afternoon. Absolutely nothing else without Mother Teresa \u2019 s permission. Young people walked miles in the scorching heat, often barefoot, on burning black pavements, because Mother Teresa decreed it had to be forbidden.",
        "A highly decorated penguin has been given a promotion in a special ceremony at Edinburgh zoo. A resident king penguin, Sir Nils Olav, is an honorary member of the king of Norway\u2019s guard and inspects the soldiers when they visit the Scottish capital. One of a colony and knighted in 2008, the penguin has now been given the new title of Brig Sir Nils Olav. The honour was bestowed on the animal in a ceremony attended by more than 50 Norwegian soldiers from the unit. The troops are taking part in this year\u2019s Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo.",
        "There\u2019s a new Tarzan in town. Well, not only in town \u2014 clambering through the treetops as well, and swinging around on vines that seem to drop from the clouds. But who cares where he is when he is played in a new film, The Legend of Tarzan, by Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd of the HBO vampire series True Blood? This is not the time to split hairs, unless it is one of the long, golden hairs on Skarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s head, in which case take all the time you need.",
        "Mexico has widened its investigation into the abduction and apparent massacre of 43 trainee teachers in the city of Iguala in 2014 to examine the role of federal and state police, a federal prosecutor said. During the first year of the investigation, authorities focused on the municipal police in Iguala and the nearby town of Cocula, who federal prosecutors said were in cahoots with a drug gang suspected of killing the students. The disappearance of the 43, on 26 September 2014, sparked international outcry, battering Mexico\u2019s reputation and plunging President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s administration into crisis.",
        "There are lots of words used to describe people such as me. Medics and their allies will use some Latin or Greek to make their language appear authoritative and scientific. According to them I am obese, or someone requiring bariatric intervention. By extension, in newspapers I am part of an anonymous population blob known as \u201cthe obese\u201d. If I go shopping for clothes I might be called plus size. If I meet someone who finds someone with a body like mine shameful, I might be euphemistically described as big or large.",
        "The 44th president of the United States of America respectfully sent his condolences in an official statement to the family of Fidel Castro, Cuba\u2019s revolutionary leader. Some foreign countries did more. At the Spanish embassy in Havana, for example, the flag was hoisted at last Monday. As I passed the US embassy in a cab, I noticed the flag was flying high. The 45th US president tweeted \u201cFidel Castro is dead\u201d and that he would look for \u201ca better deal for the Cuban people [and] the people\u201d.",
        "The Florida Keys are three months away from a straw poll vote on whether to release millions of genetically modified mosquitoes on an island just east of Key West, and the tourist destination is awash in lawn signs. Alongside the typical signs to vote for court clerk, judge, sheriff or school board are signs that showcase the overhead view of a mosquito and read: \u201cNO CONSENT to release of genetically modified mosquitoes\u201d.",
        "Milwaukee mayor Tom Barrett declared a citywide curfew in a press conference on Monday in an effort to quell violent unrest in the wake of a police shooting over the weekend. \u201cThere is a curfew that will be more strictly enforced tonight for teenagers,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cSo parents, after 10 o\u2019clock your teenagers better be home or in a place where they\u2019re off the streets. \u201d The mayor did not specify what discipline curfew violators should expect.",
        "The federal government is significantly reducing the volume of prescription painkillers that can be manufactured in the United States, citing a decreased demand for such opioid drugs amid a public health epidemic of prescription drug abuse and addiction. The Drug Enforcement Administration announced this week that the amount of most opioid medications that can be manufactured for sale and research in the US in 2017 will be reduced by 25% or more from this year\u2019s quota. The federal agency sets annual quotas to regulate the production of controlled substances in US.",
        "Do you love the smell of a chlorinated pool in the summertime? Unfortunately, urine for a surprise. That aroma is actually a result of disinfection byproducts, or DBPs, created when people skip the bathroom and pee in the pool \u2014 and those DBPs are not good for you. A new video produced by the American Chemical Society explains that when urine and other organic matter mix with the disinfectants we use in pools, they set off chemical reactions that produce compounds such as cyanogen chloride, chloroform, dichloramine, trichloramine and bromoform \u2014 AKA the unwanted DBPs.",
        "Buoyed by recapturing Falluja from the Islamic State and the seizure of an airbase on Saturday, US and Iraqi officials are intensifying plans for an assault on Mosul, the terror group\u2019s last urban stronghold in Iraq. The US will send 560 more troops to the newly taken base, around 40 miles south of Mosul, which will be used as a staging point for the coming battle that officials suggest is likely to be launched later this year. The fight for the country\u2019s city will define the fate of Isis in Iraq.",
        "A member of the US navy has been charged in connection with the death of a black transgender woman who was found dead in a hotel room in St Martin, Mississippi, on Saturday. Dee Whigham, a recently graduated registered nurse, is believed to have been stabbed to death at a Best Western hotel, but investigators were waiting for full autopsy results before ruling an official cause of death. Dwanya Hickerson, 20, has been charged with capital murder in connection with Whigham\u2019s death.",
        "When he reached the of Wimbledon this year, many tipped the Lucas Pouille as a star of the future. After his victory over Rafael Nadal in the fourth round of the US Open on Sunday evening, he looked a lot like a star for the present. Pouille outlasted the champion over five gruelling sets to reach the where he will play his countryman Ga\u00ebl Monfils who had earlier beaten Marcos Baghdatis.",
        "After an dog named Mika escaped at Mexico City airport en route to Houston this week, her distraught owner posted a brief video on Twitter, calling on the airline she was traveling with to find her missing pet. The tearful plea touched a nerve: Pamela \u00c1lvarez\u2019s post was retweeted more than 20, 000 times, and the hashtags #Mika and #BuscandoaMika (Looking for Mika) trended on Mexican Twitter. When the dog was found and reunited with its owner, the story trended again, and the airline turned the episode into a public relations win.",
        "I was marching up New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue on Saturday afternoon behind a woman carrying a sign that read: \u201cKeep your tiny hands off my pussy. \u201d We were heading towards a looming tower with tinted windows where the lives and I thought to myself: this is absurd. We should not think of any of this as \u201cnormal\u201d.",
        "If this year\u2019s US presidential election has taught us anything, it is that celebrity or notoriety can be translated into electoral success. But it\u2019s hard to see how that can apply to the imploding of American politics: Anthony Weiner, immortalised in the year\u2019s most horribly watchable documentary, by Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg. Weiner was a talented Democratic politician who appeared to have overcome sex scandals from his time in Congress and was running for New York mayor. He was clearly a smart, vigorous, committed guy.",
        "The Football Association parted company with its England manager, Sam Allardyce, because it found his unmoderated Big Sam demeanour, covertly filmed for a newspaper by people posing as investors, boorish and \u201cunbecoming\u201d. The FA has subsequently admitted that Allardyce broke no rules he did not, as widely misreported, advise how to break football regulations forbidding ownership, and that was why the FA had to give him a \u00a31m payoff.",
        "And so ends the great populist uprising of our time, fizzling out pathetically in the mud and the bigotry stirred up by a caudillo named Donald J Trump. So closes an era of populist outrage that began back in 2008, when the Davos dream of a world run by benevolent bankers first started to crack. The unrest has taken many forms in these eight years \u2014 from idealistic to cynical, from Occupy Wall Street to the Tea Party \u2014 but they all failed to change much of anything.",
        "Google and Facebook have conveyed nearly all of us to this page, and just about every other idea or expression we\u2019ll encounter today. Yet we don\u2019t know how to talk about these companies, nor digest their sheer power. We call them platforms, networks or gatekeepers. But these labels hardly fit. The appropriate metaphor eludes us even if we describe them as vast empires, they are unlike any we\u2019ve ever known. Far from being discrete points of departure, merely supporting the action or minding the gates, they have become something much more significant."
