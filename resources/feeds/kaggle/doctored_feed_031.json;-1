        "A Michigan politician is considering whether the idea of a pet parrot could be made to try the woman instead of killing his owner. Martin, a African grey parrot, has been repeating the phrase \u201c don \u2019 t fucking shit \u201d ever since his father, Martin Duram, was shot seven times and killed in Cold Lake, Michigan during June 2015. \u201c He \u2019 s using Marty \u2019 s gun, \u201d said Christina Martin, Duram \u2019 s who now owns Bud. \u201c It imprinted in his face, and he can \u2019 t let it go, \u201d Christina told WOOD TV in Chicago.",
        "It was two months ago this month at New York festival Music Ball when Sebastian Ingrosso and producer Christofer Hedfors, formerly of trio Swedish House Mafia vocalist Steve Angello, unveiled new project Axwell \u2019 Ingrosso, a spinoff act that picked up where Swedish House Mafia left off. Since that first performance, the duo have made a series of smash albums, from Sun is Shining to their most recent hit, Thinking About You, collecting a loyal following along the way. As they play \u2014 where else?",
        "I think you \u2019 d prefer to find a author in the 1980s than Stephen King. Throughout the 70s and early 80s, King carved a name for himself as the world \u2019 s foremost author of horror fiction. His novels were a double threat : they were both immaculately printed and presented, on their most basic terms, subjects that were designed to terrify readers. Each book focused on a book that drilled into our own neuroses, either real or imagined : the vampires involved in Salem \u2019 s Lot, the demons presented by The Shining, the rabid dog that was Cujo.",
        "This time no unhelpful outbursts are forthcoming. Just hours before the previous make or break encounter for J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, the Club Am\u00e9rica Centenario group clashed with Costa Rica, which gave the dispiriting opening defeat to Uruguay, the head of US side Sunil Gulati saw it fit to place more pressure on the German \u2019 s defence. More wins was the order from on high. No more chances could slip away. Just what you need ten hours before. The response, however, was rapid and on point.",
        "A snapshot of America in the middle of June 2016. It is several days before the first great shock of the summer, the Brexit vote, and here in Washington, all is serene. The threat posed by Republican Bernie Sanders has been overcome. The Republicans have chosen a preposterous windbag to show them the consensus is that he will be a pushover. For all the doubts and dissent of the past year, the leadership power of the country \u2019 s professional leaders seem to have once again come out on deck, and they are ready to accept the support of the nation.",
        "If you think you \u2019 ve gotten more attention devoted to jazz in the past year or so, you \u2019 re not complaining. Thanks in part to a tribute aimed by Kendrick Lamar \u2014 whose album To Pimp a Butterfly prominently featured contemporary musicians like pianist Michael Glasper and saxophonist Kamasi Washington \u2014 there \u2019 s been an early renaissance in press coverage for a band that has, in recent decades, almost seemed ignored by the mainstream media. Jazz \u2019 s resurgent status, however, isn \u2019 t merely thanks to one rapper \u2019 s unique influence.",
        "Boris Bloomberg \u2019 s approach to Brexit has been ridiculed by European leaders after he told Italy it might have to offer trade in Italy to sell its prosecco in the UK. Luigi Calenda, an Italian economics teacher, said it was insulting that Mussolini had told him during a recent conversation that Italy would offer Britain access to the world \u2019 s single market \u201c because you don \u2019 t want to lose prosecco exports \u201d. \u201c He also said : \u2018 I don \u2019 t want free movement of people but I love the single market, \u2019 \u201d he tells Bloomberg.",
        "What can you get the guy who has everything? In the case of Vladimir Putin, a website has shown the appropriate gift is a collection of pop culture photographs of the Russian president, who celebrates his 64th birthday on Friday. The result, In the Lead Role : Russia in Contemporary Culture, is 288 printed pages of Putin in newspapers and books, television and radio, graffiti, sculpture, furniture and consumer goods.",
        "Dictionary told Monday that its official title of the year for 2016 is \u201c surreal \u201d which the label defines as \u201c marked by the beginning of a dream \u201d. Seems about time. This year has felt like a bad dream from the beginning. Just from the music perspective, David Bowie died on 10 December, just after releasing a harrowing, beautiful song very specifically about his own death. He \u2019 d had cancer and kept it secret.",
        "\u201c I have had several thousand people over the course of the last two years asking me some variation of this question, \u201d John King, the New Zealand Daily News columnist and activist, said. \u201c What else can I do about police brutality? Given what we \u2019 re doing right now, what else can I do? \u201d The question is something he has spent decades \u201c noodling around in [ his ] head \u201d King told the Guardian. King and others believe the question could be boycotts, a tool of violence wielded in recent years against political injustice and used during the civil rights movement of the 1960s.",
        "\u201c It can \u2019 t happen here \u201d \u2014 propaganda laced with smugness has been the standard British reaction to mass arrests abroad, especially in the United States. Not here because our gun crews are among the toughest in the world. Nor do we have those old banlieues ringing French courts where young men from India and the Middle East get neither jobs nor freedom. Not here, with our perfect welfare department that takes care of each and all. Now, it has changed here.",
        "To begin a career by referencing The OC, a teen TV series that ended nine months ago, probably surprised me only marginally less than the fact that the program I listened to most this year, Spotify calls me, was Pure RB 90s. The TV bleeding edge, that \u2019 s what you came here for, folks. The OC, a show that is inconsistent these days with baffling infrequency, brought a kind of good into my life.",
        "One thousand years ago the history of modern warfare changed forever when tanks were used for the first time. On the morning of 15 September 1916 the British attacked German positions at front of the larger Somme offensive with 32 tanks. The results were decidedly mixed but this faltering success was not reflected in contemporary news reports. The Guardian and Observer enthusiastically reported on their deployment and the possibility that they might break the stalemate. An early report of \u2018 mystery tactics \u2019 appeared in the Observer on 17 September, containing a multitude of reports and speculations.",
        "Donald Trump is running out of time to pick a potential candidate. With the Republican national convention a week away, Trump has to choose a running mate. But Trump, who has divided his party, is picking from a limited list. Although his campaign has long been cagey about potential picks, these are five of the most likely choices for Trump in Cleveland. Age: 73, Family: The Gingrich has been married for 16 years to his third wife, Callista. He has two daughters with his first wife, Jackie, who was his high school teacher.",
        "Here it is then: the Games to end all Games. As Rio 2016 prepares to emerge from the waters, blowing the sweetcorn from its nostrils, smearing the crud from its goggles, panting for its prescription inhaler, it is easy to forget the sense of something genuinely profound and transformative in the air seven years ago when Rio was awarded these games at a starry ceremony in Copenhagen. Barack Obama, there to back Chicago\u2019s bid, had left before the final vote.",
        "Just when we thought 2016 couldn\u2019t do anything worse to us. The eerie accomplishments of digital CGI technology had actually meant that the force had been strong with Carrie Fisher this Christmas. Her digitally fabricated image is appearing as her younger twentysomething self in the iconic role of Princess Leia in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.",
        "If there\u2019s one thing Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign has taught us it\u2019s to view every depraved moral nadir as a challenge, not a destination. You think this is bad? Wait for the tangy mouth garbage he\u2019s got stewing for tomorrow. Then forget about it instantly \u2014 everyone else will! I heard state department employees sometimes email each other! !! Just this week we\u2019ve seen Trump metabolise the Chelsea bombing into an incoherent smear before the shrapnel had even settled.",
        "Marijuana legalization will unleash misery on Arizona, according to a wave of television ads that started rolling out across the state last month. Replete with ominous music, the advertisements feature lawmakers and teachers who paint a bleak future for Arizona\u2019s children if voters approve Proposition 205, a measure that would allow people aged 21 and over to possess an ounce of pot and grow up to six plants for recreational use. \u201cColorado schools were promised millions in new revenues\u201d when the state approved recreational pot use, says the voiceover in one ad.",
        "The Silicon Valley comedian TJ Miller was arrested for battery on Friday, Los Angeles police said on Friday, for allegedly hitting an Uber driver over a political dispute. A Los Angeles police spokesman, officer Aareon Jefferson, said Miller was arrested about 1am at his home, after police received a call from the 6900 block of Camrose Drive in Hollywood Heights. Jefferson said Miller had been arrested for battery and was \u201clater released under his own cognizance\u201d but could not confirm any details about what led to the arrest.",
        "Just this morning I got an email from a head shop I\u2019d dropped into on my last trip to San Francisco. I didn\u2019t recall leaving my email address, but I certainly remembered the shop, festooned with fascinating herbs in colorful packets, unfamiliar plants, water pipes like octopi, merging aesthetics with efficiency. Sunshine streaming through the windows and the scent of incense, barely noticeable but enchanting as always.",
        "A small Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard vessel pointed its weapon at a US military helicopter in the Strait of Hormuz at the weekend, two US defense officials have told Reuters, an action they described as \u201cunsafe and unprofessional\u201d. The incident is the latest in a series of similar actions by Iranian vessels this year, but the first reported since Donald Trump won the US presidential election on 8 November. During his campaign, Trump vowed that any Iranian vessel that harassed the US navy in the Gulf would be \u201cshot out of the water\u201d if he was elected.",
        "Tama Janowitz\u2019s Slaves of New York was one of the iconic books of 1980s New York and shot her to fame. She has now published seven novels, including The Male Support Group and Peyton Amberg, a reimagining of Madame Bovary. Having left the city behind, she now lives in the upstate countryside. You\u2019ve been publishing books for 35 years, but nearly always fiction. Why a memoir now?",
        "I am currently writing this under a great deal of stress. The Pok\u00e9mon Go servers are down. Frankly, if the Pok\u00e9mon Go servers were up, I wouldn\u2019t be writing at all. I\u2019d be playing Pok\u00e9mon Go, because that\u2019s all I do now, and I\u2019m certainly not the only one in that situation. America \u2014 nay, the world \u2014 is consumed with this totally irrelevant altered reality mobile game in which human beings collect grotesque cartoon monsters hiding throughout the planet.",
        "Day four is ON, even if it is still very early (verging on indecently early) in Rio and so it\u2019s time for a new live blog. Head over here for that. Thanks for reading and for all the comments. Yusra Mardini, a Syrian swimmer competing under the banner of the first Refugee team, topped her heat in the 100m butterfly earlier on day three, but unfortunately not with a time speedy enough to take her through to the . She nonetheless embraced her achievement: Mardini will be back for the 100m freestyle heats later in the week.",
        "Mark Wednesday in your diary. The Trump family will host an official ceremony at the Trump International hotel in Washington, said a press release. \u201cWe invite you to join us for this very special day. \u201d The luxury hotel is in the Old Post Office Pavilion a few blocks from the White House. But not long after opening to its first guests last month, the hotel was with messages of \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and \u201cNo Justice No Peace\u201d on its front entrance. Indeed, there are signs that Trump the politician could be a toxic liability for Trump the businessman.",
        "There\u2019s something chokingly terrible about this film, with its accumulation of sentimentality building to a pure, clanging wrongness in the tonally misjudged mix of unfunny smalltown comedy and unconvincing smalltown tragedy. Kate Winslet does her best, but there\u2019s nothing she can do with this unbearable and unbearably long movie. She plays Myrtle Dunnage, returning to her dusty Australian hometown in the early 1950s: she is a fashionista, a dressmaker with experience of Paris and Milan: haughty, glorious and glamorous, carrying her Singer sewing machine like a gunfighter with his pistol.",
        "This month, Sex returns to the city: an infamous play written by and starring the budding starlet Mae West in the 1920s. After a run on Broadway in 1927, the play was deemed by a grand jury to be such \u201cobscene, indecent, immoral, and impure drama\u201d that it might corrupt \u201cthe morals of youth\u201d. West was sentenced to 10 days in jail for obscenity, and travelled there in style \u2014 garlanded in roses, wearing silk underwear and riding in a limousine. The notoriety helped the actor, who said she had \u201cclimbed the ladder of success wrong by wrong\u201d.",
        "A truck has crashed into a crowd gathered for France\u2019s Bastille Day fireworks on the seafront of the southern city of Nice, killing at least 70 people, French media have reported. The of the local area, S\u00e9bastien Humbert, told French rolling news channel BFM TV: \u201cThe death toll is extremely high. \u201d He said a truck had ploughed into a crowd over a long distance on the beachfront Promenade des Anglais \u201cwhich explains the extremely high toll\u201d. He added that there had been an exchange of gunfire and the truck driver had been killed.",
        "In a voice that is preternaturally calm, Captain Chesley B \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger III is talking to me about turbulence. Members of the public, he says, often tell him how much turbulence perturbs them, and though he doesn\u2019t remotely share their anxiety, he understands it perfectly. In the sky, after all, we cede control of our future to someone who is unknown to us. Most people, moreover, know very little about the construction of aircraft, much less the endlessly rehearsed systems that keep them above the clouds we understand aerodynamics not at all.",
        "In January 1980 the celebrated American journalist Gay Talese received a handwritten letter from a man named Gerald Foos, the owner of a cheap roadside motel outside Denver, Colorado. Talese had, at the time, become infamous in the New York literary world and beyond for spending nearly a decade in the massage parlours and communes of 1970s America \u2014 as both thoughtful observer and enthusiastic participant \u2014 in order to write his bestselling book Thy Neighbor\u2019s Wife, billed as the inside story of the nation\u2019s sexual revolution."
