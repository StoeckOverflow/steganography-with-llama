        "It is make your straight up time for America. A bigger, incrementally better, United States or a US flirting with a dystopia from the viewpoint of a Stephen King or Cormac McCarthy? A serious but flawed Democratic president or a Republican whose votes would be the sum of all three? That \u2019 s the choice, the only choice, on earth. If we had a vote, we would need it to elect Hillary Clinton as president on Tuesday. She has a serious and ambitious policy framework for America \u2019 s inequalities and injustices. She has an internationalist outlook.",

        "Daniel Jones had always been friendly with the agency personnel who stood near his door.

        "As an Indigenous man, there was never any question of whether I should travel to Standing Rock or not. I needed to witness firsthand what was happening there, and wanted to offer aid to those fighting for the right of Indigenous to exercise agency over their own futures. Only one problem remained : I had to find a way to go. I am not a man of means. I weighed expenses, such as bills and work, and covered travelling expenses.",

        "Today it\u2019s bad to be good. Bad Moms, a film about the impossible expectations of parenting by the people who did The Hangover, has been a massive summer hit.

        "Confusing the real world with the slice of reality reflected by one\u2019s social media accounts is a mistake political reporters and partisans make every day. Algorithms and selection bias have conspired to drastically narrow the world wide web for must of us.

        "What is baseball without superstition? Rally caps, that dare not speak their name until the seventh, and, of course, the dreaded postseason curse.
