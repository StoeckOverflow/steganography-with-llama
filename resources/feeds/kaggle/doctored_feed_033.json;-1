        "The Swedish media says it has given up efforts to reach Bob Anderson, days after it awarded him the first prize in literature. \u201c right now we are doing nothing. I have called and sent emails to his closest associates and received very friendly calls. For now, that is certainly enough, \u201d the Foundation \u2019 s permanent secretary, Maria Danius, told state TV SR on Monday. So far the American troubadour has responded with excitement since he won the prize on Friday. He gave a concert in Las Vegas that very night, but makes no mention of the accolade.",
        "Those in search of the idea of youth should not hang up their heads, but in a laboratory in the Netherlands ask what may be the answer to a more immediate mystery : why some people looked younger than others of the same species. In a study published posthumously, scientists in Rotterdam seemed for the first time to have developed a gene that specifically described how old people lived. The gene came to attention when researchers noticed that children who carried mutations in the gene appeared, on average, five years older than they were.",
        "Facebook \u2019 s latest effort to flag content deemed to be \u201c fake \u201d came on Friday, as new questions emerged about the limitations of the methods the social media group has put in place to outsource the services. The tech company \u2019 s efforts to swiftly test a system to identify fraudulent news reports has won plaudits from experts, including some participants in the project. However, its first day of operation brought questions about the mechanics of the fake \u2014 and Facebook \u2019 s apparently unwillingness to press for a process that relies solely upon voluntary donations of users and a handful of users.",
        "Ominous music, reminiscent of a horror movie, ends while a stranded priest lies alone in a dusty barn. A lone horseman rides up, a treat out of a classic western. But the priest is a drunk and a thief who enjoys robbing his savior the hero is actually a priest, though not, he insists while shooting the priest \u2019 s bullets and instead, a thief. Cue the credit sequence, a homage to the spaghetti western, A Fistful of Dollars. In the Land of Violence, directed by Ti Long, packs a lot into its emotional moments.",
        "Twenty minutes ago, almost to the bottom, Bob Dole, then the Republican candidate for president, slipped and fell off a stage. He was 73, and his aides moved swiftly to put a positive effect on the tumble : if he can fall down and get back back up again, that proves he \u2019 s strong enough for the White House! But that \u2019 s not how most people saw it. Earlier that same day Dole had offered congratulations to the Brooklyn Dodgers, a team that had not folded for four decades.",
        "Lonely mouse befriends fantasy creature. Grownups like fantasy creature. Pete must protect one, before saying goodbye. Everybody learns. Kid vs. Fin. A childrens \u2019 fantasy from director David Lowery, Pete \u2019 s mother drags an orphan called Mike and a dragon called Fin through a reliable routine. The play is part ET, Part Jungle Book, parts Peanuts. It \u2019 s sweet and soulful and but with a bitter edge. Pete ( Oakes Fegley ) is five months old when he and his parents are injured in a car crash that killed mum and dad and left the boy wandering the countryside alone.",
        "The sexual assault scandal that led to removal of the president and revered former coach of Baylor University revealed a problem with a bedrock of the high school \u2019 s education : a rigorous conduct code banning alcohol, drugs and premarital affairs that may have driven some students into silence. Representatives of the William Hamilton law office who investigated Baylor \u2019 s reaction to sexual assault investigation determined the school \u2019 s new approach to drugs, drinking and sex and \u201c perceived judgmental nature \u201d to victims who reported being assaulted \u201c created barriers \u201d to reporting assaults. Some women raised the prospect of their family being separated.",
        "It was the lack of money that made this particular rivalry feel different. Usually when a Boston team wins out during the postseason, social networking and sports talk might act as platforms for cathartic venting and loud ranting. And there was some of that after the Cleveland Indians swept the Boston Red Sox in game three to seal a clean sweep in the American League Division Series. There were calls for Red Sox manager John Brown to be fired, and insults aimed at starting pitcher Dave Price for not living up to his hefty salary.",
        "\u201c I want to focus this election on my policies for the president, not on Bill Clinton \u2019 s presidency, \u201d Trump told Channel Six via Facebook. \u201c Jobs, trade, ending American immigration, veteran spending, and strengthening our military is what I really want to be talking about. \u201d whether Trump \u2019 s core party may back his position on curbing immigration \u2014 but they disagree with him over international trade and US intervention in Nato, an opinion poll has begun.",
        "As Barack Obama meets Angela Merkel for the second time in his presidency, he would be tempted to think back to one of their first conversations, when the German chancellor gave a historic speech in front the US Congress in October 2009. Unusually for a politician whose personal rhetoric is characterised by wilful unwieldiness, Merkel \u2019 s rhetoric flowed freely, except for personal anecdotes and hyperbole.",
        "On the Prairie Drifter Ranch in central Minnesota, parents Joan and Nick Olson are cultivating more than just organic vegetables. Using their seven acres of vegetables \u2014 including tomatoes, cucumbers and onions \u2014 they \u2019 ve also added flowering plants, dogwood and elderberry hedgerows to various species of bees and plants essential for the health of the environment. The Olsons are not beekeepers, but they are part of a movement to reconnect organic farming to a healthy environment.",
        "For most of the presidential campaign, Melania Trump was notable more for what she didn\u2019t say than what she did. When she finally took center stage, at the Republican convention in July, her words turned out to be borrowed in part from the woman she will now follow into the White House, Michelle Obama. Trump was reportedly mortified by the error, which brought forth Broadway star Laura Benanti\u2019s first impersonation on TV.",
        "Enchantments, the oldest witchcraft store in New York, has not been open for an hour but already it\u2019s buzzing. A man in a neat blue dress shirt, cellphone clipped to his belt is in the back of the shop, talking to one of the employees who carves custom candles for spells. He needs luck, he explains, to close a business deal. The deal could fall apart even after a contract is signed, so the spell had to last, he carefully explains.",
        "The supreme court will take up transgender rights for the first time in the case of a Virginia school board that wants to prevent a transgender teenager from using the boys\u2019 bathroom at his high school. The justices said on Friday they will hear the appeal from the Gloucester County school board some time next year. The order means that student Gavin Grimm will not be able to use the boys\u2019 bathroom in the meantime.",
        "The French government has vowed to overhaul its emergency smartphone app designed to alert the public to an ongoing terror attack after it malfunctioned during the attack on Nice. The government\u2019s instant alert app, created after last November\u2019s terrorist attacks across Paris and launched last month just before the Euro 2016 football tournament, is supposed to send instant warnings, information and advice directly to people\u2019s phones if a bombing, shooting or other terrorist incident happens near them.",
        "The CW has beat Marvel and DC\u2019s film universes to introduce a gay lead superhero. At the network\u2019s Television Critics Association panel on Thursday in Los Angeles, the channel revealed that its sister streaming site, CW Seed, will premiere a new animated show, Freedom Fighters: The Ray, centered on the Ray, a gay DC Comics superhero. In the comics, Raymond \u201cRay\u201d Terill is a reporter gifted with powers, after being exposed to a \u201cgenetic light bomb\u201d while working on a story.",
        "Maurice Walker\u2019s case is far from exceptional. Arrested on 3 September 2015 for public intoxication, Walker, a black man with a serious mental disorder that leaves him unable to work, was faced with two options: pay a $160 cash bond and leave jail that day, or remain in jail over a holiday weekend. Walker told officials that he couldn\u2019t afford the standard bond required by the city for the misdemeanor and wound up spending six days in jail, only being allowed out of his cell for an hour a day.",
        "If their aim is to capture public attention, then last week can be counted as a success for terrorists. Despite the crisis, Islamist militants managed to cut through the noise. They did this with two attacks. One on Turkey\u2019s main international airport left 41 people dead. A second, almost 4, 000 miles away in Bangladesh, killed 20 expatriates having dinner in a restaurant in the diplomatic zone of the unstable south Asian state\u2019s capital, Dhaka. Many other strikes around the world went ignored.",
        "Kanye West has confirmed that he and Drake are working on an album together. Speaking to Vogue, West said: \u201cWe\u2019re just working on music, working on a bunch of music together, just having fun going into the studio. We\u2019re working on an album, so there\u2019s some exciting things coming up soon. \u201d A joint venture between the pair had previously been hinted at, when a billboard appeared in Los Angeles next month, displaying a pairing of West\u2019s GOOD Music and Drake\u2019s OVO logos.",
        "Three people died after attending a weekend rave in Fontana, California, headlined by Ice Cube, Major Lazer and dozens of other and electronic dance music performers, officials said Monday. The man and two women were among nine people hospitalized during the Hard Summer Music Festival, San Bernardino county sheriff\u2019s spokeswoman Jodi Miller said.

        "A Massachusetts man was arrested and charged on Tuesday with threatening to burn down Boston\u2019s largest mosque and with making other threats online against Muslims. Patrick Keogan, a resident of the Boston suburb of Winchester, was charged with making a criminal threat over the internet and with being a convicted felon illegally in possession of ammunition, federal prosecutors said.",
        "Well, the cat is out of the bag. The moggy in question may be knocking on for 40, and the bag is coming apart at the seams, but no matter: the story can finally be told. In 1976, during the filming of Star Wars, Carrie Fisher, who played Princess Leia, and Harrison Ford, who was Han Solo, crossed over to the Dark Side and \u2014 according to Fisher\u2019s new memoir \u2014 had a affair.",
        "Smoking scenes still regularly occur in movies deemed suitable for children, despite significant evidence that they can cause adolescents to take up the habit. The data about cigarettes on screen is relevant right now because a lawsuit is seeking to ban tobacco appearances in movies. In 2015, 47% of films rated had at least one occurrence of smoking or tobacco use according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That figure has fallen since 2014 but the CDC still notes that \u201cindividual movie company policies alone have not been efficient at minimizing smoking in movies\u201d.",
        "The lawyer representing former Fox Friends anchor Gretchen Carlson in her sexual harassment lawsuit against Fox News chairman Roger Ailes says she has spoken with three other women, out of many more who emailed her, alleging similar behavior on Ailes\u2019s part across decades. \u201cIt\u2019s been amazing,\u201d Nancy Erika Smith told the Guardian. \u201cMy website, my email and my office phone have been deluged with women telling similar stories. I\u2019ve only talked to three of them because I\u2019ve been doing other things with regard to this case, but we\u2019ve had clients who\u2019ve come with similar complaints about Ailes and Fox.",
        "Samsung and US safety officials announced a recall on Friday of nearly 3m washing machines after reports that the appliances \u2014 just like the company\u2019s Note 7 smartphones \u2014 are exploding and injuring people. The Consumer Product Safety Commission said on Friday that Samsung has received 733 reports of washing machines \u201cexperiencing excessive vibration or the top detaching from the washing machine chassis\u201d.

        "is a town preserved not in amber but by language. The words of its most famous son have made this Warwickshire town a sacred spot ever since the great actor David Garrick staged a Shakespeare jubilee at Stratford in 1769. That date is significant. It\u2019s in the very early days of the industrial revolution, when Britain had barely been modernised and many medieval as well as Tudor buildings were still in use. A world we have lost could still be found.",
        "Chris Evans\u2019 Top Gear hit a new ratings low for its series finale on Sunday, finishing with fewer than 2 million viewers, lower than any episode in the Jeremy Clarkson era. The sixth episode of the first series drew 1. 9 million viewers from 8pm on Sunday, nearly 1 million viewers down on the previous week and less than half its launch overnight audience of 4. 3 million. No episode in the programme\u2019s Clarkson era, beginning in 2002, had fewer than 2 million viewers.",
        "For those first four rounds, was an unexpectedly intriguing fight \u2014 before an eye injury, and Golovkin\u2019s fearsome power, proved too much for Brook. He is sensible to leave middleweight boxing behind, but has improved his standing even in losing his undefeated record. Golovkin, meanwhile, enjoyed a challenge against a slippery challenger, but remains undefeated, and still the middleweight champion of the world. Thanks for joining me \u2014 a full report and more reaction will follow. Goodnight. Dominic Ingle is invited to offer his opinion, but can hardly speak, after spending five rounds screaming blue murder at his man.",
        "The value of Britain\u2019s top 100 companies came close to an closing high on Tuesday as the stock market benefited from a plunge in the value of sterling. The FTSE 100 closed at 7, 074. 34, taking it closer to the 7, 104 record reached in April 2015. Shortly before closing, the FTSE came within one point of the high of 7, 122 but the index fell away during the closing auction. The FTSE 250 index of more domestically focused firms also received a boost, climbing 0. 8% to an closing high of 18, 342.",
        "The latest furore over Hillary Clinton\u2019s alleged misuse of private emails when she was secretary of state in has thrown a tumultuous and unedifying US presidential election into even greater confusion, with little more than a week to go before voting day. The FBI\u2019s unexpected and very public revelation that it is recommencing its investigation into Clinton\u2019s conduct may not be politically motivated, but its timing certainly makes it appear that way. The row represents yet another hammer blow to a democratic process whose credibility has been repeatedly challenged, principally by the unscrupulous Republican candidate, Donald Trump."
