        "I was infatuated with a boy from the age of 12 until just a few weeks ago. He was eighteen years older, so understandably had little interest in me at a younger age. But he soon become interested in my strange interest in him, and an unlikely friendship blossomed. We confided in each other for years, and I put him through his drug problems that never seemed to go bad. His life was falling apart, and only in retrospect can I see the impact that had on mine.",
        "A British pilot who was trying to run, jump and swim from Marble Arch in London to the Arc de Triomphe in France has died crossing the border. Nick Thomas got into trouble in the water near Calais, according to Enduroman \u2014 the event \u2019 s organisers. The from the Shropshire town of Ellesmere, across the Welsh border, had been sailing for 16 hours. A spokesman for the World Swimming and Piloting Federation believed a man had died, but thought he was doing what he loved.",
        "Kate Greene was always one of those people who made lists to occupy her thoughts. Even as a she was still carefully writing out her requirements for a \u201c contract of mateship \u201d for her boyfriend, Singe. \u201c wrote at least twice a year, \u201d she wrote out in fountain pen on a piece of A4 with red highlights. \u201c Flatter me. ( Remember, flattering can get you everywhere ), \u201d it went on. \u201c Supply a man once a week. \u201d \u201c Complete fidelity. Private ownership. \u201d \u201c Take me out late evenings. \u201d \u201c Be loved and to love. \u201d \u201c Tell no lies and seek straight answers.",
        "A new medication that \u201c wakes up \u201d the immune response to attack cancer has changed the lives of people with metastatic pancreatic cancer and has no raising hopes for a new and powerful tool against the most intractable threat of the disease. The drug, is also groundbreaking because pancreatic cancer that has spread to other parts of the body also kills within a few minutes. Unlike other immunotherapy treatments, is not likely to have any which have been hugely debilitating for many patients and also led to disability in some places.",
        "Are you adjusted to the word Normal yet? Former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott said ABC Radio stated that the US and UK polls and Brexit vote show that the viewers don \u2019 t want to tell pollsters what they would think because they would see \u201c excoriation.",
        "Nigel Farage would have burst a blood bank, had he only had the chance to listen in. What could be more metropolitan liberal elite than last week \u2019 s great Christmas telethon, as readers listened in to journalists to make a list for child refugees? Just like it, all those Islington luvvies and bleeding hearts, rushing in from one part of London N1 to another, the Bollinger chilling nicely in the middle, as they salved their consciences and congratulated themselves on being leftier than thou. How utterly Guardianista. Except it was nothing like that.",
        "Be careful what you tell John Goodman, who wrote in Kong : Skull Killer. What started as an innocuous question at San Diego on Saturday, about reviving a hit movie franchise, was converted into an impressive comic riff about interacting with one of the biggest names around. \u201c You always had to call him Kong or Mr Kong. You couldn \u2019 t call him by his name, which is good, \u201d a Goodman recalled in a column in \u2019 s voluminous Hall H. \u201c But when the chips are down he \u2019 s a hell of a performer. He \u2019 s bringing the goods.",
        "Canada has blocked Kinder Morgan Inc \u2019 s hotly contested plan to twin a line from the Alberta oil sands to the west coast, setting up a coalition with environmentalists who helped elect the energy minister, Justin Trudeau. The provincial government, seeking to meet demands from both greens and the energy industry, said allowing Kinder Morgan to build a second highway next to its existing Table Mountain line will also ensure oil exports reach Asia and avoid reliance on the US dollar.",
        "The \u2019 s favorite source of abuse is \u201c loser \u201d \u2014 lobbed more than 200 words from his toxic Twitter account, at victims from Jeb Bush to Tom O \u2019 Donnell. When people around him are winners, \u201c loser \u201d never be an insult worth reclaiming. There \u2019 s a from 1920, the worst Francis Picabia ever saw, in which the French artist breaks apart his face, sutures it with black pasted papers, and brands his face with the word RAT\u00c9 : a loser, a loser, a man defeated. And yet he flashes a crafty smirk, peeking out from under one of those pasted scraps.",
        "The Great Barrier Reef could be considered again for an \u201c in danger \u201d listing by the United Nations World Heritage Foundation following the devastating bleaching this occurs, the Guardian can reveal. The news came as a group of local lawyers, scientists and politicians wrote to the committee, calling it to ask Australia to do more to restore the reef.",
        "It was a poignant celebration for Republican grandees : they gathered to rehabilitate an outcast, a leader recently deemed unfit for the White House, only to grapple with a potential brand new one. The Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum reopened on Friday after a $ 15m opening, drawing family, friends, allies and a brass band to honour the 37th president, but it was a new 45th president and his scandals, not Watergate, who hovered over the nation.",
        "A wave of revulsion strikes around the world. Approval votes for incumbent leaders are quickly collapsing. Symbols, slogans and sensation trump strong and nuanced argument. One in ten Americans now believe that home rule would be a great idea. From all this I draw the obvious, peculiar conclusion : no company with a McDonald \u2019 s can remain a loser. Twenty years later, the New York Post columnist Thomas Wolfe proposed his \u201c golden triangle theory of conflict among \u201d. This holds that \u201c no two brothers that both have McDonald \u2019 s have ever declared a war against each other since they each lost their McDonald \u2019 s \u201d.",
        "Lately, Craig Robinson is prone to saying \u201c amazing \u201d a lot. It \u2019 s the word he uses to describe Sausage Party, Seth Rogen \u2019 s hit cartoon in which different food items in a refrigerator discover the nature of their true existence \u2014 with laughs and exciting scenes. ( Robinson drolly buys a box of grits named, Yeah, Mr Grits. ) Robinson often uses the word \u201c amazing \u201d to describe his first film of the Sundance film Festival in January, where he won a special Jury prize for his performance in Escape From America, in which he plays a kind, loving father to a child.",
        "For Rivers Cuomo, Pinkerton \u2014 Weezer\u2019s second album \u2014 was like getting too drunk at a party. Even five years after its 1996 release, the band\u2019s frontman still had a hangover. Talking to Rolling Stone, he compared his experience of Pinkerton, which turns 20 on Saturday, to cathartically spilling your guts out and then waking up the next morning to realize \u201cwhat a complete fool you made of yourself\u201d. For a long time, Cuomo talked about Pinkerton like it was his high school diary, a humiliating reminder of a time when he was unapologetically emotional and corny.",
        "People are already calling it the fashion moment of 2016. In Galeries Lafayette, an upmarket department store in Paris, cult label Vetements, purveyor of elevated streetwear, is staging its latest collection. The brand is opening staid old couture fashion week with a show featuring genuinely unexpected collaborations with various other fashion labels \u2014 Manolo Blahnik boots, rejuvenated Juicy Couture tracksuits \u2014 and models with a haute level of scowl.",
        "On a hot and lazy afternoon in Palm Beach, the only sign of movement is the water gently lapping at the grounds of the private club that is the prize of Donald Trump\u2019s real estate acquisitions in Florida. Trump currently dismisses climate change as a hoax invented by China, though he has quietly sought to shield real estate investments in Ireland from its effects.",
        "Earlier this week, soon after dawn had broken over central London, I joined a boisterous crowd for breakfast and the 2016 Comment Awards. Now it is probably fair to say that 8am rarely presents journalists at their sparkling best, but the MC, Peter York, was witty the winners\u2019 speeches were in their brevity, and we were within tantalising reach of the end, when a struck. The penultimate winner turned down her award. We quickly passed on to the last winner, but the rejection marked quite a departure.",
        "So, is $3bn a lot of money? Of course it is. Is $3bn enough to banish or manage all disease in the world within the next 84 years? Of course it isn\u2019t. Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan have announced a plan to invest \u00a33bn in medical research over the next 10 years. They claim this sum will enable them to play a key role in curing, preventing or managing all disease by the end of this century. In comparison to what governments spend on basic medical research, $3bn is, of course, a negligible amount.",
        "Hillary Clinton needs millennials, and her best hope at winning them over might be the septuagenarian they tried to elect. Bernie Sanders, the beloved leader of the nation\u2019s leftwing movement, appeared alongside his former rival at a university gymnasium in New Hampshire on Wednesday and issued an urgent appeal to disillusioned young voters: \u201cIt is imperative that we elect Hillary Clinton. \u201d Millennials have long eluded Clinton, who lost the youth vote in the primaries to Sanders by blowout margins.",
        "Two women carried out suicide bombings at a bustling market in the Nigerian town of Madagali on Friday morning, killing at least 30 people and wounding 67, the army said. The attack came as the Nigerian government claimed it was routing the Boko Haram extremists blamed for the blasts. The explosions occurred on the edge of the extremist group\u2019s Sambisa forest stronghold, which the Nigerian military has been bombing ahead of ground assaults. Since the military dislodged the insurgents from towns and villages this year, they have been attacking \u201csoft targets\u201d.",
        "Facebook has hit a hitch in its plans to use a unmanned drone to provide internet access to developing nations, after it was revealed the American National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has opened an investigation into an accident on the drone\u2019s first test flight in June. At the time, Facebook described the flight as \u201csuccessful\u201d: the drone, called Aquila, stayed aloft for 96 minutes, three times the planned duration. \u201cWe have a lot of work ahead of us,\u201d Jay Parikh, Facebook\u2019s head of engineering and infrastructure, wrote when Facebook revealed the test flight, in late July.",
        "These days, going to a festival is much more than just a camping jaunt to see bands. What are you going to call the photo album on Facebook? How many portable chargers will one phone drain? These concerns can distract from the task at hand \u2014 having a blowout wild enough to keep you going until Christmas. A new event could solve all this. Lost festival keeps its whereabouts a secret and insists punters leave their phones at home.",
        "What with being illegal in this country, and so strongly favoured elsewhere by the nastier cult leaders, polygamy has not had the best press in recent years. The polygamy survivor\u2019s memoir, usually detailing protracted slavery and abuse, has proliferated almost into a literary genre, although not, it emerges, one influential enough to have deterred British practitioner Mr Azad Chaiwala from a new campaign to \u201crevive\u201d polygamy.",
        "For former Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf, this will be his first weekend as a wealthy retiree. So it goes in a world where big banks can screw over customers and the public, and the CEO who presided over these practices can slink off into the sunset unencumbered by the kind of real retribution that plagues drug users and petty thieves. They go free. We pay the price. Two days before the bank\u2019s quarterly earnings announcement, Stumpf announced his immediate resignation.",
        "An Israeli technology company has been accused of creating and supplying an aggressive interception program capable of taking over Apple\u2019s iPhones and turning them into remote spying devices, after it was allegedly used to target a Middle Eastern human rights activist and others. The discovery, announced on Thursday, prompted Apple to issue an urgent software update to block the exploitation.",
        "Raj Aggarwal took a bite of the burger and paused, looked straight ahead as he chewed, and shrugged his shoulders. \u201cIt tastes like a burger, very tasty,\u201d said Aggarwal, the founder of a startup called Localytics. \u201cNot quite bloody though. \u201d Bloody would be hard, since that burger was made of plants, the first product from a fake meat startup called Impossible Foods. But bloody is what they\u2019re going for.",
        "Millennials \u2014 people born between 1980 and 1995 \u2014 will be familiar with studies making claims about them, from observations on their eating habits to their anxiety levels. But now their sex lives, or lack thereof, are also being put under the microscope. A US study suggests that young people born in this bracket are less sexually active than previous generations. This was found to be particularly true for younger millennials born in the 1990s, sometimes referred to as the Snapchat generation.",
        "Young black men were nine times more likely than other Americans to be killed by police officers in 2015, according to the findings of a Guardian study that recorded a final tally of 1, 134 deaths at the hands of law enforcement officers this year.

        "Its surface is hot enough to melt lead and its skies are darkened by toxic clouds of sulphuric acid. Venus is often referred to as Earth\u2019s evil twin, but conditions on the planet were not always so hellish, according to research that suggests it may have been the first place in the solar system to have become habitable.",
        "When I was 10 years old, I loved Charlie\u2019s Angels, Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman and the Madeleine L\u2019Engle novel A Wrinkle in Time. On Thursday night, when Chelsea Clinton mentioned it in her speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, I pumped my fist in the air and cheered before I even realized what I was doing. The book was first recommended to me by my elementary school librarian. \u201cIt won the Newbery Award,\u201d she told me. \u201cI think you\u2019ll like it. \u201d I didn\u2019t just like it, I loved it."
