        "Just days after the new Paris agreement formally came into force, war denier Donald Trump \u2019 s government has thrown the global balance into uncertainty and raised hopes that the US will reverse the difficult environmental course taken under Barack Obama. Several environmental groups gathered at the UN climate meeting in Morocco said it would be a catastrophe if Trump acted on his desire to withdraw the US from the negotiations, which took 20 years to accomplish, and to open up public competition for coal, oil and gas extraction.",
        "Pep Guardiola had been asked on television how he might stop Alberto Messi. The Manchester City coach simply laughed. There is no need to stop one of the all \u2011 new greats, as Guardiola himself knows better than most from his eight years in charge at Villa, and the Argentina international re \u2011 emphasised the opportunity to make this a difficult homecoming for his new manager. Messi \u2019 s came courtesy of three sumptuous swipes of that left corner and the latest statistic to laud his genius shows that he now has 16 goals in 15 games against three clubs.",
        "History was broadcast on Tuesday night in November. The majority of delegates at the Democratic national convention named Hillary Clinton as their candidate for president \u2014 making her the youngest woman to ever be selected as the nominee for either major American party. A split screen showed photos of the previous 43 male candidates and an animation of glass panels, before cutting to a video of Clinton. She told the crowd : \u201c We just saw the biggest crack in that glass ceiling yet.",
        "The Catholic Bishop Jos\u00e9 Alfredo S\u00e1nchez Guill\u00e9n was seized from his parish church in rural Michoac\u00e1n, where he served a flock of corn farmers and ranchers. The next day, the wreckage of his Santa Jetta was discovered on the outskirts of the town of Quiroga, 71 miles ( 115km ) from where it had been stolen. The victim \u2019 s body was discovered on fire on a lonely stretch of road, nearly a week after his abduction. He had been killed five times in the search.",
        "California regulators ordered Uber to remove its vehicles from the grid on the same day that the company \u2019 s trucks were caught running flashing lights \u2014 violations the agency immediately blamed on \u201c navigation error \u201d. \u201c It is essential that Uber take appropriate measures to increase safety of the public, \u201d the state department of motor transportation ( DMV ) wrote to Uber on Wednesday after it defied federal officials and began piloting the aircraft in San Francisco without permits. \u201c If Uber does not confirm officially that it will stop its launch and obtain a testing permit, DMV will threaten legal action.",
        "It has been described as \u201c the best book event of 2016 \u201d by the UK trade journal, Previews. Though there are no super soldiers in Issue IV No 1 of Love and Violence, dated July 2016, though actually on sale 28 October. Instead, the comic, exclusive to newsstands on its 35th anniversary, continues its critically acclaimed stories of ageing rural Californian punks and bizarre central Asian villagers. Rolling Stone ranked Love and Death as the greatest graphic novel of all time, likening it to the Clash, REM and.",
        "Opposition parties are warning that the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) faces another war if president Claude Kabila does not relinquish his grip on power and steps down when his mandate ends. The DRC has seen repeated bouts of conflict since Kabila, 45, announced that elections scheduled for this month would be delayed. The country \u2019 s political coalition and part of the opposition recently agreed to postpone the elections to April 2018. However, the elections was boycotted by Rassemblement, the main opposition group, which says it violates the constitution. Belgium \u2019 s powerful Catholic Church also rejected the proposals.",
        "Lyor Cohen has less of a reputation in the record industry. He \u2019 s not on the same scale as David Geffen, who spent most of the 1970s on the phone screaming at labels, or Walter Yetnikoff, who spent most of the 1980s inebriated and howling at the keyboard. Rather he is known for a curt songwriting style, honed through three careers in the business that began in recordings and touring, and was followed by a dip into the label system ( both independent and major ).",
        "Few genres devote themselves to nostalgia like horror. From the Street Monsters to cheeseball B films, from Italian giallo to gory 80s exploitation flicks in cheap VHS cases, nobody can reflect fondly on it all. Even the distasteful teen porn of the early 21st century earned a few points just for pissing so many viewers off. But who will ever be nostalgic for the mainstream horror films that are flooding our day today? Lights Out is simply another snoozer centered on an underdeveloped genre concept that won \u2019 t even make kids a good show.",
        "We may not notice when fascism creeps up on us : we may be too busy laughing. They say that ordinary people struggled to take the rise of the 1930s demagogues seriously. They take the strutting dictators in their silly uniforms just too seriously. And in some cases, derision was the right word. Britain \u2019 s own Hitler, Oswald Mosley, was mocked into oblivion by PG Wodehouse \u2019 s fictional hero, Roderick Spode. Donald Trump seldom invites laughter. We are appalled but we are also amused. He is funny.",
        "Hillary Clinton has once again blamed Russian security services for hacking the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) computer system and accused Donald Trump of supporting the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. As she did so, Clinton denied having ties to Crimea and Russia and appeared to accept his approval of Russia \u2019 s acquisition of Crimea from Ukraine. In her last national interview upon clinching the Democratic nomination, Clinton spoke to Fox News Sunday. The interview was aired in Pennsylvania on Saturday morning, before Trump criticized Khizr Khan, the father of a dead daughter, who spoke at the Democratic national convention.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s choice for defense secretary was among military officials who, the FBI concluded, received anonymous emails from the woman whose affair with director David Petraeus led to his downfall, the Associated Press has learned. The emails to the now retired marine general, James Mattis, and others, warning them to stay away from a socialite from Tampa, led to the discovery of Petraeus\u2019 affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell, and revelations that he had shown classified secrets to her. The FBI also concluded that Broadwell was the source of the anonymous emails.",
        "I don\u2019t think that in all my years of doing this I\u2019ve ever seen such dreadful pictures of injuries, of people lying on the floor of an emergency room, the dead mixed with the living. One colleague, who I speak to all the time, was in despair, sending me all these photographs, and saying: \u201cDavid, you have to do something to help us. \u201d But what can I do? The message out of eastern Aleppo is that there are no hospitals functioning at all. They have all been repeatedly attacked in the past few days.",
        "When I die I hope I\u2019ll have a chance to hit God in the face. If there is a God he already knows about this and he\u2019ll get away \u2014 and as an agnostic I probably won\u2019t get the chance. But he deserves it because of everything that happens to you in the third act of life: it\u2019s humiliating and debasing. My mother was my best friend. We talked about everything. I learned a lot about women and sex from her.",
        "The remarkable photos taken by Ricardo Stuckert of an uncontacted Amazon tribe reminded me of my own experience with the indigenous people of nearby Peru. \u201cThe Nomole are here, they\u2019ve come. The Nomole,\u201d were the hushed whispers I heard outside my tent as I was roused from my dawn slumber. Nomole was a term meaning brothers which I had heard many times in the last few days, at once embracing and familial yet also uttered with apprehensive concern.",
        "When someone once told Joseph Heller, the author of that he hadn\u2019t written anything as good since, Heller famously replied: \u201cWho has?\u201d Similarly, if JK Rowling were to appear on stage riding a dragon that spewed molten gold and breathed fire, the majority of the audience would likely mutter: \u201cNot as good as Harry Potter. \u201d And so to Richard Adams, who died on Christmas Eve. No matter what he did before or since, he will forever be associated with Watership Down.",
        "Twenty years after Arundhati Roy won the 1997 Booker prize for her debut novel The God of Small Things, the Indian novelist\u2019s second, The Ministry of Utmost Happiness, is set to be published in 2017, her publisher has announced. Roy has published a wide range of nonfiction, covering topics from the US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan to a condemnation of India\u2019s nuclear tests, since she won the Booker in 1997 for her story of twins Rahel and Estha growing up in Kerala.",
        "Pok\u00e9mon Go has caught the world by storm, sent Nintendo\u2019s stock price rocketing, atheists into churches and Australians into police stations. But it can be confusing and a lot of legwork, literally, if you screw something up \u2014 so here are a few tips to get you started. It might seem obvious with \u201ccatch \u2018em all\u201d as the strap line for the game, but catching duplicates of Pok\u00e9mon is good. Each time you catch a duplicate you still get the associated evolution candy, and you can transfer unwanted Pok\u00e9mon to the professor for more candy.",
        "The largest gathering yet of Pok\u00e9mon Go players in San Francisco was almost a total disaster. Up until a half hour before more than 9, 000 people were supposed to begin gathering at select locations in the hometown of the viral game sensation\u2019s developer, Niantic Labs, the servers were down. \u201cI was panicking,\u201d said Natasha Asbury, a spokesmodel for Samsung who drove about 40 miles to San Francisco from Vallejo in order to attend the meetup. \u201cI was like, I dressed cute for nothing.",
        "Concerns about dangerous lead in drinking water have reached Congress \u2014 quite literally. It\u2019s been discovered that a key congressional office building has high lead levels in its water supply, with workers being provided with bottled water to consume instead. A recent routine test found the elevated lead levels in the Cannon House Office Building in Washington DC, according to an email sent out by William Weidemeyer, the House office buildings superintendent. According to Politico, Weidemeyer\u2019s memo to lawmakers and their staff states that the lead levels are \u201cslightly above the EPA standard\u201d.",
        "Paula D\u2019Amore was never expecting to give birth in the backseat of her Jeep. A few hours after she felt a contraction on 7 April, she loaded into the car and her husband started driving to the hospital, only to feel a burning sensation as the car pulled into its driveway. \u201cNever in a million years would I have thought this would happen,\u201d D\u2019Amore said. Her husband ran into the hospital to tell the staff his wife was in labor.",
        "Hillary Clinton has an 81% chance of winning the election to Donald Trump\u2019s 19% polling analyst Nate Silver said on Wednesday in his first model of the 2016 presidential election. Silver\u2019s calculations are based on a model that processes polling data exclusively. A second model produced by Silver\u2019s FiveThirtyEight web site, taking in economics statistics and historical data, portrayed a slightly tighter race, at 74% % for Clinton. Silver gained international fame for his perfect, performance at predicting state outcomes in advance of the 2012 presidential election.",
        "In the debate on the future of Europe \u2014 too often boiled down to more or less Europe \u2014 new divisions, groups and fault lines are likely to emerge that will reveal differences not just between countries but within countries and between ideologies, too. The German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has probably made the strongest case for more central control over national budgets \u2014 but does so on his terms, of rigid fiscal discipline to stabilise the euro.",
        "Tides are rising and a hurricane is due. Crime is growing, families are fleeing and hundreds of thousands are out of work. At best, they are forced to follow men and women who cannot even agree to fight a virus that harms infants. At worst, their leaders are corrupt. More than 1, 600 miles from the island of Puerto Rico, Marisol Rios De La Luz is at Columbia University, with a long commute from Williamsburg. She majors in environmental studies and has an interest in activism.",
        "Hundreds of people are still unable to return to their homes in Marseille, but authorities have said that fires are no longer threatening the southern French city. At least two wildfires had been burning toward the Mediterranean port, forcing the airport to reroute incoming flights to make way for firefighting aircraft. With winds still high, authorities said on Thursday the danger was not over for some nearby towns, and roads in the area were closed. Whipped on by high winds, the blaze destroyed homes in the town of Vitrolles, about 25km (15.",
        "Montagues and Capulets. Edison and Tesla. Bloods and Crips. Among history\u2019s greatest rivalries none has been so fierce as that between cat people and dog people. In honor of International Cat Day, Facebook researchers examined the behavior of these warring factions to find some insight into who they are and how they operate. The team of data scientists wanted to find out who has more friends, who is more likely to be single and who has the best taste in TV.",
        "San Diego police are investigating a series of violent attacks against homeless people, including one man who was \u201cbadly burned\u201d and killed, raising concerns that someone may be targeting vulnerable individuals living on the streets. Police in the southern California city, which has long grappled with a large homeless population, said on Tuesday that they believe the same suspect is behind three gruesome attacks against homeless people over the weekend, including the two murders.",
        "A report in the journal of the American Society of Microbiology has declared once and for all that the \u201cfive second rule\u201d \u2014 in which food dropped on the floor does not pick up germs for five seconds \u2014 is not real. Hold me, I think I\u2019m going to faint. For all of you out there who thought that spilled food could be spared the scourge of bacteria, this must be a sobering realization. That slice of pizza, that errant chicken wing or that glazed donut that went tumbling out of your hand are now tainted.",
        "The US army corps of engineers ordered North Dakota police to arrest Native American protesters and destroy a bridge that activists built over a creek at the center of the increasingly tense Dakota Access pipeline demonstrations. The Morton County sheriff\u2019s office announced on Wednesday that police were in a \u201cstandoff with protesters on the banks of the Cantapeta Creek\u201d while activists said they were engaged in a peaceful water ceremony. Police claimed that the protesters \u2014 who have for months been attempting to block construction of the $3.",
        "The federal government is investigating prisons throughout Alabama in an inquiry that is \u201cpossibly unprecedented\u201d. The investigation comes after a series of strikes and riots that have revealed the state\u2019s prisons are in turmoil. \u201cIt\u2019s a giant investigation. This is rare,\u201d said Lisa Graybill, a staff attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is conducting an investigation of its own. Previously Graybill worked for the federal unit that will investigate Alabama, and said the closest comparison in memory was an examination of Puerto Rico\u2019s juvenile jails. \u201cTaking on a whole state is unusual and possibly unprecedented,\u201d she said."
