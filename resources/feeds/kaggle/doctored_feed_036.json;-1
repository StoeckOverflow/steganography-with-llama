        "Unknown gunmen have captured an Australian employee of a restaurant in the Afghan capital, Kabul, Afghan police have reported. General Abdul Rahman Rahimi, the Kabul city police chief, said the woman was abducted on Saturday afternoon. She was with her Afghan driver when she was driving away, Rahimi said. It was unclear what happened to the driver. \u201c We have had lots of developments in the abduction case... but even now I can \u2019 t share it with the media, \u201d Rahimi said.",
        "Michigan would begin its presidential recount at sunset on Monday, a federal judge ruled in a order that could make it more likely the Senate will complete the count instead of a 13 December deadline. In his opinion on Sunday night, judge Mark Goldsmith rejected an order by state officials to increase the of about 4. 8m ballots. Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein argued that a requirement is unconstitutional that requires a period of at least two voting days after the Board of Canvassers \u2019 take action on a recount request.",
        "It \u2019 s a commonly accepted belief among Americans that more guns make life safer. On Friday, it came to light that one of the most outspoken proponents of this belief \u2014 John Lott, writer of The War on Guns \u2014 had fudged his head. This is no surprise to me. I know that, when you are being shot at, your first thought is to move away \u2014 not shoot us. Any claims to the contrary were also bound to be wrong.",
        "Vladimir Putin has personally handed a full Russian passport to the American actor Steven Seagal and said he hoped the gesture represents a \u201c normalisation \u201d of strained relations with Putin. Sitting at a round table in the Kremlin at a televised meeting on NBC, the Russian president asked the Hollywood star where to put the passport. The two presidents then rose and shook hands, with Putin saying publicly : \u201c I congratulate you, \u201d and Seagal answering, in Russian : \u201c thank you very much.",
        "Rejecting unwanted suitors over lunch is an awkward challenge for a couple of online daters. So why not outsource the thorny interaction to a date? Ghostbot will detect incoming messages from the person you \u2019 ve chosen to \u201c ghost \u201d \u2014 a modern ( and cowardly ) dating policy that involves ceasing all communication with an incoming suitor \u2014 and send automated emails, lacking in warmth of love, until the other person takes the time. For example, if the other person calls for a date, Ghostbot might add : \u201c Nope, \u201d \u201c I just have no time left now, \u201d or \u201c Sorry, just me and [ pizza emoji ] tonight.",
        "Over the years, Reagan has sometimes played a disproportionately significant part in US affairs. Jimmy Carter received the embassy hostage controversy for his failure to secure a reelection term, and Reagan \u2019 s second term was damaged badly by the revelations. The deal secured by the Obama administration with Iran over the Palestinian question in July 2015 has remained violently divisive between Democrats and Democrats. So it was no surprise that Iran lost again in the debate between the presidential candidates on 26 September.",
        "Less than a week after the tragedy in Orlando, a similar cycle is setting in. On Monday, Americans went to sleep thinking about one event. On Thursday morning, we caught up to another, watching an innocent victim die on a bicycle taken by his girlfriend. On Friday night, we fell asleep to the horrors of a third. Such events used to feel like an aberration.",
        "There \u2019 s slightly less espionage action in the fourth season of the impeccable spy series, as KGB sleeper agents Philip ( Paul Rhys ) and Elizabeth Jennings ( Keri Russell ) take time off to collect themselves. Not that it stops them doing a heist to pull biological weapons out of a room. What we said : What makes The Office one of the standout shows in the \u201c golden age of television \u201d is that it isn \u2019 t about spy at all.",
        "Most art is subject to interpretation. But given the seismic event of 2016 in terms of political upheaval and bloodshed \u2014 it \u2019 s no wonder many music videos have arrived with more than an essence of the apocalypse about them. Early this year I wrote about the way in which music videos had taken on strange and often absurd narratives, a flourish which demonstrated both the temperament of the creatively liberated times and addressed the competitive requirement of watching an album launch an \u201c public \u201d. On reflection, art was always reflecting life, a sense of foreboding and dread running along.",
        "Cycling through downtown for the first time in two years, I couldn \u2019 t help but notice this proudly beachfront town instead of Los Angeles is finally being remade in jauntily angled boxes of glass, steel and glass. Economic wealth is pouring into what was once a small scuffed and sleepy neighbourhood, a place that celebrated barefoot living in small cottages. The style of the early modernist is strongly reminiscent of one man : Frank Gehry, who has a long and abiding connection to Hollywood.",
        "The of a former National Security Agency ( NSA ) contractor arrested for secretly stealing classified documents has described him as a workaholic hoarder more interested in terrorism than politics. Elizabeth Taylor told the New York Times she would be horrified if her former husband Paul, whom she has not seen since 2009, insulted his country by deliberately taking on government secrets. Richard Martin, 51, from Glen Burnie, Tennessee, was secretly arrested by the government in August after federal prosecutors said he illegally took highly classified material and stored the material in his home and car.",
        "India \u2019 s protection for women has been criticised for claiming that the country \u2019 s rape and domestic violence problem is exploited by the media, driving away tourists. Maneka Gandhi, the minister for women and child welfare, told a workshop for women journalists that India ranks \u201c among the lowest performing countries in the world \u201d for rape cases, according to a survey of people in attendance.",
        "It has become increasingly possible to imagine Portugal with their name on the Euro 2016 trophy. After three draws at the group phase and a grubby last 16 win over Croatia, following they entered this having not played particularly well but having played well enough. Fernando Santos\u2019s team deserved to win here, having been the better team for most of the game and, when it came down to penalties, they made sure that they set up a against Wales or Belgium next Wednesday.",
        "On a winter\u2019s day in Melbourne in 2012 I was offered some tickets to an exhibition of Napoleon\u2019s uniforms, furniture, china, paintings, snuff boxes, military decorations and memorabilia. We are often told he is a tyrant but we do not quite listen. We hear him compared to Hitler, but the comparison does not take root. For all the blood and human waste and murderous narcissism of his career, the late phases of the French Revolution and the Consulate, and then the Empire, possess ineffable style in ideas and new politics, in art and human venturing.",
        "The team behind Little Miss Sunshine tackle the 1977 gender war between Bobby Riggs, tennis pro, and Billie Jean King, the young ace (then No 2 in the world) he challenged to a match. Steve Carell (whose breakthrough was in Sunshine) plays the old pretender, Emma Stone his rackety opponent. This means war: Christopher Nolan\u2019s second film not set in the present (or future) is an epic tableau about the rescue of hundreds of thousands of troops from the French coast. Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy and, er, Harry Styles, star.",
        "The Ukrainian film director Oleg Sentsov, who is serving a prison sentence in Russia, has smuggled a defiant letter from his jail in Siberia, comparing himself to a \u201cnail that will not bend\u201d. Sentsov, a and activist, was arrested in Crimea in May 2014 soon after Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, annexed the peninsula. He had been helping to deliver food to Ukrainian soldiers marooned at their bases following Russia\u2019s takeover. In 2015, a Russian court convicted him and fellow activist Alexander Kolchenko after what his family say was like a show trial.",
        "I am a few days into training my cat and things aren\u2019t going too well. She has been sick all over the carpet and her blanket. My attempts at making her perform simple tasks are met with bafflement and tail flicking. The toys I have crafted for her are summarily ignored. At one point, she starts chewing on the copy of the training book I\u2019m using, looking me in the eye as if to say: \u201cJust you try.",
        "Arsenal win it at the death then, with a few tantalising glimpses of future attractions in the build up to that goal. They were given a good workout by the and a couple of scares in what turned out to be a competitive game. Xhaka looked classy \u2014 causing problems from open play and set pieces with that sweet left foot. He looks like a good addition for Arsenal, but surely there\u2019ll be more reinforcements to come. But only Arsene knows. .. Thanks for your tweets and emails. Sorry I couldn\u2019t use all of them. Good night.",
        "In his diary, Andy Warhol wrote that he would love to film Danny Fields\u2019 life story. The artist died six weeks later, but now Fields\u2019s life has finally arrived the screen in a new documentary called, Danny Says. You may not have heard of Danny Fields, but you definitely know his friends.",
        "The first time I was in the same room as Donald Trump was in the summer of 2015, right after he\u2019d begun focusing his rhetoric on how Mexicans were rapists to aid his argument that we needed a wall between the US and Mexico. Back then no one actually imagined that the man we all knew from his hotels or reality show could be a serious candidate for president, let alone the actual president. This was made evident as I sat in the Chicago ballroom. Colleagues sitting close by were seemingly not bothered by anything he said.",
        "A judge in Ontario, Canada has denied a request to have the Cleveland Indians barred from using their name and logo in Toronto, in a ruling issued just hours before Cleveland takes on the Toronto Blue Jays in game three of the American League Championship series. On Monday, the Ontario superior court heard an application arguing the Indians\u2019 name and mascot \u2014 Chief Wahoo, a cartoon drawing of a man with red skin and a feather tucked in his headband \u2014 are offensive and discriminatory.",
        "Cristiano Ronaldo versus Gareth Bale, CR7 against Team GB, top dog against . In the days leading up to Portugal against Wales an outsider might be forgiven the assumption that what they are about to witness is at best a game of at worst some kind of celebrity cage fight. King Meringue versus the Welsh Prince, with a supporting cast to pass the towels and hold the spit bucket. There has been something of the boxing match buildup in Lyon, with a focus on the aspects and attempts to goad both teams\u2019 superstars into a little trash talking.",
        "One of the summer\u2019s TV hits was The Night Of \u2014 the compelling story of one man\u2019s footcare regime, let down, sadly, by a distracting murder subplot. But the true smash of the summer was Stranger Things, an idiosyncratic, set in the fictitious town of Hawkins, Indiana. Producers may have been wary of casting seven young actors in a programme\u2019s lead roles, but Netflix struck gold both with the show itself and those actors\u2019 energy, which, it\u2019s fair to say, hasn\u2019t exactly been confined to a spooksome netherworld. There they are performing Uptown Funk at the Emmys!",
        "Alongside the trusty Billy bookcase and the Domb\u00e5s wardrobe, Ikea could soon see the Yeezy bedside table, after Kanye West declared his desire to collaborate with the Swedish furniture giant in no uncertain terms. \u201cYo Ikea, allow Kanye to create,\u201d he said in an interview on BBC Radio 1 on Monday. \u201cI have to work with Ikea \u2014 make furniture for interior design, for architecture.",
        "Russia\u2019s weightlifting team have been barred from competing at the Rio Olympics over doping offences, the sport\u2019s governing federation said on Friday. The International Weightlifting Federation said some of the Russian competitors had been named in a report commissioned by the World   Agency which exposed evidence of   cheating in Russia. \u201cThe integrity of the weightlifting sport has been seriously damaged on multiple times and levels by the Russians,\u201d the IWF said in a statement. \u201cTherefore an appropriate sanction was applied in order to preserve the status of the sport. \u201d",
        "If you\u2019re among the majority of American voters who just voted against the party soon to control all three branches of our government, you\u2019ve probably had a run of bad days. You felt this loss like a death in the family and coped with it as such: grieved with friends, comforted scared kids, got out the bottle of whisky, Netflix. But we can\u2019t hole up for four years waiting for something that\u2019s gone. We just woke up in another country.",
        "As Americans celebrated the Fourth of July holiday weekend with parties and fireworks, authorities said an eastern Iowa woman was killed when a homemade cannon exploded at a backyard gathering. Davenport television station reported that Lori L Heims of Edgewood was flown to an Iowa City hospital, where she was pronounced dead. The Delaware County sheriff\u2019s department said Heims was injured at the gathering with friends in Greeley around 11. 40pm on Saturday.

        "The first person to spot a clown, the patient zero in the current epidemic of threatening clowns sightings spreading across the US, was a little boy at a apartment complex in Greenville, South Carolina. He ran to his mother, Donna Arnold, and told her what he had seen: two clowns in the woods, both brightly dressed and made up. One with a red fright wig and the other with a black star painted on his face. They whispered something to the boy. \u201cThey were trying to lure him to the house,\u201d his mother told me, pointing toward the woods.",

        "Hillary Clinton was quick to cite Trump\u2019s refusal to back away from birtherism as evidence that the Republican nominee was fanning the flames of racial division. Addressing the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute at its annual gala in Washington on Thursday evening, Clinton condemned Trump for continuing to push conspiracy theories surrounding Obama\u2019s birthplace. \u201cHe still wouldn\u2019t say Hawaii. He still wouldn\u2019t say America,\u201d the Democratic presidential nominee said. \u201cThis man wants to be our next president?"
