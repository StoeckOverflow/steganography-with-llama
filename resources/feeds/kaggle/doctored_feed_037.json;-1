        "It is being described as the celebrity equivalent of the Super Bowl, World Cup Final and Rumble in the Jungle rolled into one \u2014 or the smartest person in the room versus the class clown. When Bill Clinton faces Donald Trump in the first Senate debate on 26 September, a worldwide TV audience of tens of millions is expected to witness a fascinating clash of styles that could go a long way to determining who enters the White House.",
        "Inspired by President Trump \u2019 s responses during the third presidential debate, iPhone users are humorously attempting to see great works of fiction through the Republican \u2019 s eyes using # TrumpBookReport. The idea seemed to have been created from a widely shared tweet from Tom French, a city alderman and mayoral nominee in St Louis, Missouri, criticizing Trump for his earlier, remarks during the debate. \u201c Trump \u2019 s foreign policy may sound like a brief report from a teenager who hasn \u2019 t read the book, \u201d French replies on Wednesday night. \u201c Ah, the grapes!",
        "A man unconscious and and shocked with a police Taser inside a hospital room while attending a mental health hospital has filed a lawsuit alleging negligence, excessive force and fabrication of facts. Alan Pean, who has a history of bipolar disorder and anxiety, felt he was extremely manic and drove to St Andrews medical center in south Houston on 26 August last year. He crashed his vehicle outside the building but was not critically hurt. He was admitted for medical observation by emergency room staff and was set to be arrested the following morning.",
        "The Turkish government and allied forces have launched attacks on Kurdish insurgents and Islamic State Forces positions across the border in Syria, according to international media. The Hurriyet newspaper stated artillery fire had targeted targets north of the city of Manbij, which a force recently attacked from Isis, while television reports indicated Turkish howitzers firing on Isis targets near the border town of Jarablus. \u201c The fundamental aim in the military operation is to open a gate for moderate rebels, \u201d a Turkish official said.",
        "In 1899, the American sociologist Thorsten Veblen introduced the phrase \u201c conspicuous consumption \u201d in his book The Theory of the First Class. The phrase was : Veblen was skeptical of the wealthy flaunting their wealth, but he argued that more ordinary people needed goods and services to help \u201c the reputability of the household and its head \u201d. In short, status matters. Also, conspicuous consumption, which dominated much of 20th century Western culture, is at a turning point. Over the past 10 years, the Internet and the pervasiveness of social media have brought about new channels through which to operate conspicuously.",
        "The BeyHive did not take kindly to Trump surrogate Betsy McCaughey branded Hillary Clinton a hypocrite for using Donald Trump \u2019 s sexist remarks despite also being a parody of Beyonc\u00e9. \u201c Hillary Clinton expresses that she finds the violence on that bus horrific, \u201d said McCaughey on CNN on Monday, stating that she herself did not like \u201c rap music \u201d. \u201c But in fact she likes things like this : \u2018 I came to slay bitch, when he fuck me good, I blow his ass to Red Lobster, \u2019 \u201d quoting Prince \u2019 s song Formation.",
        "Jordan Spieth says he will not be troubled by thoughts of what occurred to him at the Masters two weeks ago when he looks to make his US Open card this week at Oakmont Country Club in Pennsylvania. The American missed the chance to claim life jackets when he suffered a leg collapse while leading at Augusta National in April, with Canada \u2019 s Danny Willett taking turns to win his first tournament.",
        "Female sexuality has perplexed scientists, fuelled an equality movement and propelled Meg Ryan to fame. Now researchers say they might have found its scientific roots. The purpose of the euphoric orgasm has long puzzled scholars as it is not necessary for conception, and is also not experienced by women during conception itself. But scientists in the US have come up with an answer. Human body orgasm, they say, would be a from our evolutionary past, when the hormonal surges that preceded it were crucial for reproduction.",
        "Artist Peter Jackson has said that she chose to spoof photographs of Donald Trump as part of a protest against the allegedly chilling effect a \u201c litigious \u201d president could have on artistic freedom. The celebrity lookalike specialist said she was warned by her lawyers against publishing the photographs, some of which feature a Trump lookalike in compromising manner, and that no book publisher was able to release a collection of the Trump images. Vanity Fair and the Arts Online have published some of the images.",
        "Thousands of spectators will sweat their way around the scenic highlights of East Baltimore in the city \u2019 s park on Saturday, but the action will not only be at street level. An aircraft fitted with advanced cameras is intended to circle high above their targets, as part of a secretive surveillance operation funded by Texan billionaires. Last month, Radiolab, a public radio network, featured a company called Persistent Surveillance Systems, which specialises in technology. It uses a small plane for surveillance above urban areas, providing thousands of photographs that are available to analysts who then track movements at street level.",
        "Donald Trump escalated his rhetoric against the media and against pollsters on CNN, alleging that both were part of a \u201c rigged poll \u201d trying to undermine his candidacy. Later in a rally in St Augustine, Florida, Trump also claimed that hacked emails of Joe Podesta showed that the Clinton campaign chair was \u201c rigging the polls by oversampling voting \u201d. The Republican nominee, whose campaign is managed by pollster Kellyanne Johnson, called this \u201c a voter tracking technique \u201d. Oversampling is a method used by pollsters to get better estimates of specific and is entirely avoided in polling.",
        "The Stanford sex assault victim answered personal questions about her eating habits, her behavior at school and her body, according to newly released trial documents that shed light on the \u201c traumatizing \u201d mental process the woman underwent in her viral impact report. The transcripts in the case of Brock Williams, the swimmer convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman, provide fresh insight into how the former student \u2019 s lawyers interrogated the woman he assaulted and provide a insight into a criminal process that prosecutors say can be unfair and difficult for victims.",
        "What was one of the most telling moments from the third and final presidential debate? When Donald Trump said Hillary Clinton was \u201csuch a nasty woman\u201d Guardian columnist Jessica Valenti said in a panel on Wednesday night. \u201cWomen recognized his tone in that sentence and what he really wanted to say.",
        "At least 36 people have been killed in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, the government said on Sunday, calling it a massacre in revenge for military operations in the area. Three days of national mourning have been declared following Saturday night\u2019s mass killing, the latest in a series of massacres that have left more than 600 people dead in and around the troubled town of Beni since 2014.

        "Gabby Douglas stood beneath the Rio Olympic Arena, still in her Team USA leotard, trying hard to understand how she had become the most unpatriotic athlete in Rio. Tears welled in her eyes. She tried hard to talk but no words came out. Her pauses were long and uncomfortable. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to stay off the internet because there\u2019s so much negativity,\u201d she said. The attacks against her have been everywhere these last few days.",
        "Before this year\u2019s Cannes film festival, the idea of a new Paul Verhoeven thriller was undeniably intriguing but hardly the suggestion of a sure thing. The once infamous has been rather quiet since 2006\u2019s Black Book and, as much fun as it is to get drunk and rewatch Showgirls, it\u2019s still a remarkably awful and hilariously piece of work. Elle was predicted to be nothing but a curio, tagged on to the end of a festival filled with more obvious substance and pomp. But it turned out we were all underestimating what perverted pleasures he had in store.",
        "A slippery covering of ice and snow on a steep street in downtown Montreal has caused a of cars, buses and trucks. The drama took place at a busy intersection on C\u00f4te du Beaver Hall. Footage shows a bus sliding out of control and hitting a group of cars. Moments later, as light flurries of snow continue to fall, a pickup truck hits the back of the bus. Then a second bus, also out of control as it comes down the hill, bumps into the back of the pickup truck. But the drama does not end there.",
        "For years, Melissa Ng lived a stealth existence. She was afraid to take risks and chase her dreams. \u201cIn the beginning it felt like, that\u2019s okay, this is safe,\u201d she says. \u201cI really believed that for a long time, until I realized I was forgettable. The last thing you want to keep feeling is invisible. \u201d Eventually, Ng\u2019s desire to express herself and make an impact on the world took hold, and she found a spark through a unique artform. Listen to her story of overcoming fear and insecurity \u2014 and then transforming into a master creator.",
        "Suspenseful it may not have been, but the 2016 Tour de France was nip and tuck in one way: the time gaps behind the winner. Chris Froome\u2019s victory margin was 3min more than in 2015 ahead of Nairo Quintana, but the gap to the rider in 10th was only 7min compared with 17min last year 21min in 2014 for Vincenzo Nibali and 17min again in 2013. Incredibly, after 89 hours of racing, a mere 180 seconds spanned the riders between second and 10th.",
        "Vera Rubin, a pioneering astronomer who helped find powerful evidence of dark matter, has died aged 88, her son said on Monday. She died on Sunday night of natural causes, Allan Rubin told the Associated Press. The professor of geosciences at Princeton University said his mother, a Philadelphia native, had been living in the Princeton area. Vera Rubin found that galaxies don\u2019t quite rotate the way they were predicted, and that lent support to the theory that some other force was at work, namely dark matter.",
        "More than a million Turks gathered in Istanbul on Sunday for an rally to mark the end of nightly demonstrations since the abortive military insurrection on 15 July. The Yenikap\u0131 meeting area by the Marmara Sea waterfront in the city\u2019s European side was transformed into a sea of red and white, the colours of Turkey\u2019s flag.",
        "What do Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Olympic gold medallist Ryan Lochte and comedy writer Kurt Metzger have in common? They wouldn\u2019t know how to say they\u2019re sorry to save their lives, as illustrated this week by their very public for equally public bad behavior. Let\u2019s start with the man who has so much to apologize for, the master of misspeak, Donald J Trump. At a campaign event Thursday in North Carolina, the brusque businessman made headlines for what may have been the first expression of regret in his political career.",
        "The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has filed an appeal to contest a decision by German authorities to drop an investigation into a TV comic who satirised him, according to officials in Germany. The public prosecutor\u2019s office in Mainz, western Germany, said Erdo\u011fan had formally filed a request to have the decision overturned. The suit was filed by Erdo\u011fan\u2019s lawyer on Sunday, Mainz head prosecutor Andrea Keller said. The appeal would be handled by the general prosecutor\u2019s office in Koblenz.",
        "The stoner dude who refuses to put down the pipe and pick up the Pampers is an archetype that Judd Apatow has made an entire career out of mining. Internet forums and advice columns teem with queries from spouses who feel widowed by their partner\u2019s relationship with weed.",
        "Independent investigators who investigated the disappearance and apparent massacre of 43 Mexican students in 2014 have called for a robust to resolve the case and establish the truth. Claudia Paz y Paz and Carlos Martin Beristain served on a panel that accused the government of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto in April of undermining their inquiry. They were in Geneva to meet the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein, who has voiced dismay at a lack of progress in resolving the \u201cemblematic\u201d case of 43 trainee teachers from Ayotzinapa who disappeared in the city of Iguala.",
        "Women are crazy. This isn\u2019t me being hysterical it\u2019s historical. The trope of the crazy woman stretches from Plato to Plath to popular culture. Women, we have been told in thousands of ways for thousands of years, are simply more emotional and more irrational than men. is something we were first sold by the Ancient Greeks. The problem with women, they decided, was that they had wandering wombs. So, thanks to a few wise men, half the world\u2019s population was diagnosed with a disorder: hysteria. As medicine progressed, the definition of hysteria evolved until it was eventually discredited.",
        "Halfway through a hearing on Capitol Hill, as public health officials warned of dire consequences should Congress fail to pass funding to help combat the Zika virus, Tim Kaine uttered the words everyone in the room was probably thinking. \u201cThis is why people hate Congress,\u201d said the senator from Virginia, who is thought to be a potential pick for Hillary Clinton. \u201cThis is why people hate Washington. \u201d A handful of his colleagues from both parties acknowledged one simple truth: lawmakers should appropriate funds to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and they should do so urgently.",
        "Russia and China are often bracketed together as the west\u2019s most important adversaries. They have grown closer since Russia\u2019s relations with the west soured after the annexation of Crimea. But it would be an error for the western democracies to pursue policies that force the two together unnecessarily. China is a rising power that has benefited from the existing international order Russia is a declining power that hopes to benefit from disrupting it. The west\u2019s goal for Russia should be to limit the damage Moscow can do, especially in Europe, while still working with it where necessary.",
        "Given the quite terrifying frequency at which and lowbrow horror films are released at the moment, it\u2019s strange and sweetly nostalgic to remember a time when the genre was less ubiquitous. Back in the early 1990s, scary movies were about as profitable as Adam Sandler movies are now. After the repetitive slasher movies of the 1980s, the genre had given up the ghost and no one was interested in bringing that ghost back to scare a new generation of horny teens.",
        "This article originally appeared on STAT, For years, insurers dropped sick people from their plans or denied coverage due to preexisting conditions like cancer, keeping them from the care and medicines they needed. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was supposed to make it unlawful for insurers to refuse coverage to such individuals or charge them more for health insurance. But it is still happening. No longer able to keep patients off their plans outright, insurers have resorted to other ways to discriminate and avoid paying for necessary treatments."
