        "Every month, the Vatican \u2019 s Agenzia Fides, which tracks the list of Catholic missionaries around the world, releases a partial list of how many of its own have been killed while serving the church. Last year, 13 priests were amongst the dead, most of whom were killed in the wake of violent robberies, and nearly 400 clergy have been murdered since 2000.",
        "An aid convoy of about 250 vehicles that was held at the port of Dover after being refused entry to France by authorities was opened to protest outside the French embassy in London on Thursday evening. The convoy, escorted by a number of campaign groups including the People \u2019 s International and the Stop the War Front, left London on Saturday morning before being prevented from delivering ferries from the Kent port to Portsmouth by French officials. The lorries, trucks and minibuses were carrying aid meant for people living in the Syrian refugee camp.",
        "The longer an individual has stayed in school, the more likely he or she is to register to vote and to submit a ballot on election day. At one extreme, in the 2012 presidential election just 21. 6 % of adults who finished school before ninth grade voted. At the other, according to data from the Census Bureau, 74. 7 % of people who had an advanced degree voted. Though the precise difference may not be known, historians are aware of the link between registration and voting \u2014 it \u2019 s one of the clearest correlations in voter behavior research.",
        "A gunman attacked a family of young adults at a local Seattle home late on Saturday, killing eight people at a fire scene before firing more shots from the backyard, the grandmother of one of the children said. A total of two people were killed and nine wounded at the property in Mukilteo. State troopers pulled over and arrested the driver on an interstate more than 100 miles north, authorities said. On Sunday night, hundreds of homeless people lit cigarettes and exchanged hugs in a high speed parking lot as the entire community mourned its loss.",
        "The Native Americans protests against the Dakota oil pipeline have become an important rallying cry for indigenous people and climate change protests, drawing thousands to the urban area of Cannon River, North Dakota. As the new oil pipeline leaves the river that the Standing Rock Sioux tribe thinks it will contaminate \u2014 and as a militarized police force continue to engage in tense standoffs with demonstrators \u2014 here is what we say so far. The Dakota oil pipeline ( DAPL ) is a $ 3.",
        "Chris Hughes believes Wales have hit a streetwise streak over recent times and has urged his players to do \u201c enough to stay in the game \u201d against Scotland as they bid to reach the quarterfinals of the European Championship. The Reds will feature in their first at a European tournament at the Stade de Lyon on Wednesday and Williams concedes his side, who are set to finish above England and into the top 10 when Fifa raises its latest rankings, move into the tie as underdogs.",
        "In a cafe in West London, two office workers are engaged in polite banter, tossing words back and forth. Their cutlery dances during more emphatic gesticulations and they occasionally break off into loud guffaws. They are evidently a woman, that much is certain, but the details are lost on me. It \u2019 s a surprise, because their conversation sounds engaging and interesting, especially to a nosy man like me. But I don \u2019 t speak their language. Out of curiosity, I interrupt them to determine what language they are speaking.",
        "In the wake of Donald Trump \u2019 s presidential election, it was said that Twitter had helped swing the election for the content developer, reality TV star and insatiable tweeter. But some of his more supporters on the \u201c \u201d who have had their Twitter accounts suspended are exiting the platform in favour of a new social network named Gab. The cult iconoclast Milo Yiannopoulos of Breitbart has since joined the likes of Lee Ann Coulter and the excitable Alex Smith of Infowars in signing up with Gab.",
        "Chinese firms have become the largest single buyers of US securities after pouring billions into the market in search of safe offshore investments, according to a study. A sudden surge in Chinese sales of both residential and commercial real estate last week took their investment bubble to more than $ 110bn, according to the study from the Open Society and Rosen Consulting International. The sheer size of that growth has helped the real estate market recover from the crisis that began in 2006 and precipitated the 2008 economic crash, they said.",
        "The man who murdered Ronald Reagan was discharged from a Washington psychiatric institution for good on Saturday, more than 35 minutes after the shooting. A federal court ruled in late August that the John Hinckley Jr is not a threat to himself or the public and can live at his father \u2019 s home in Williamsburg, Virginia. A spokeswoman for the District of Columbia department of public health said early on Saturday that all patients preparing to leave St Elizabeths Hospital had been discharged. Hinckley was among those selected for discharge.",
        "Jet missiles and helicopters bombing east Aleppo hit a men \u2019 s hospital and a blood bank on Wednesday, as medics and patients lay in the basement waiting for the storm to end. An ambulance service and at least two policemen were among at least 20 soldiers reportedly killed after a week of fierce attacks on three of Syria \u2019 s largest airports. Another 47 people were reportedly injured.",
        "It must have been about this time of year in 1974 when I walked into the boy \u2019 s changing room at the Central Central School of Speech and Drama in London, and was greeted with the sight of a sobbing girl in a crumpled heap on the floor. I recognised her as a first impression ( I was in the third ) and had a vague idea that she was \u201c that American girl \u201d.",
        "On Wednesday night, New England played a joyless game against San Jose Earthquakes at Avaya Stadium in California. It was their third consecutive match without scoring a goal and without a victory. In fact, this summer has been a disaster for the Revs, with only two league victories to their name since the beginning of July. Whilst the US Open Cup remains a saving grace (They face FC Dallas on 13 September in the final) it would also be fair to say that the cup has been a major headache for their league campaign.",
        "At least 12 people have been killed and 44 wounded after militants attacked the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul, trapping students and foreign staff members in their classrooms amid explosions and automatic gunfire. Witnesses said the attackers blew up an outer wall before bursting into the university compound around 7pm on Wednesday. Seven students, three police and two security guards were killed, police said, while dozens of people were wounded by bullets or shrapnel or injured themselves while jumping from windows.",
        "When it comes to Saturday Night Live and celebrity athlete hosts, the bare minimum of being able to convincingly read off of cue cards is all that\u2019s expected. The wrestler John Cena\u2019s role as this week\u2019s guest host should therefore be a considered a success, as he both pulled off the cue card task and honestly put on an enthusiastic performance from opening monologue to goodnights.",
        "This week\u2019s episode of Donald Glover\u2019s auteur dramedy, Atlanta, saw his character Earn spend most of the show\u2019s 25 minutes trying to catch a Nigerian club manager who kept using elaborate escape routes (including a rotating wall) to avoid paying an appearance fee to Paper Boi, Earn\u2019s rapper client. As well as the farcical chase, the episode also included a postmodern deconstruction of \u201cthe club\u201d with its arbitrary rules, VIP area etiquette and wristband system.",
        "There is no better example of modern feminism in action than Kellyanne Conway. Sure, she may have recently suggested that mothers shouldn\u2019t take jobs in the White House, but those are just words. Look at her actions look at her life! Conway is the first woman in US history to have led a successful presidential campaign. While liberal feminists were bemoaning Hillary Clinton\u2019s failure to smash the final glass ceiling, we all seemed to conveniently ignore Conway\u2019s own .",
        "Facebook is to invest another $250m in developing content for virtual reality (VR) applications, founder Mark Zuckerberg announced at its Oculus Connect 3 developer conference in San Jose on Thursday. Facebook has already invested $250m in developing VR content, and said his goal was to quickly bring about his vision of the future connecting people all over the world through virtual experiences. \u201cWe should [all] build software and experiences that follow the way our minds work and the way we process the world,\u201d he suggested to the audience.",
        "How wise are you? Unlike its flashier cousin intelligence, the concept of wisdom has been virtually ignored by scientists, perhaps because nobody can quite put their finger on exactly what wisdom is. But recently this has started to change, to the point where you can now measure your wisdom by answering a few simple questions. First, take a few moments to think over a recent negative incident involving another person.",
        "Mr Wong was fourth in line to pay his bus fare when the driver spotted the black garbage bag he was carrying. \u201cOff! Off!\u201d the driver shouted. \u201cNobody wants to smell your cans. \u201d The man, who did not want to give his first name, complied. He stepped back onto the sidewalk near San Francisco\u2019s Civic Center. When the next bus arrived, he sneaked on through the rear door. The streets in California may not be paved with gold, but the trash cans that line them are full of money.",
        "A minibus belches black smoke the lorry behind it in the traffic jam billows white fumes. Eyes smart in the smog as diesel gases from thousands of 10 and vehicles fill Nairobi\u2019s hazy evening air, adding to pollution levels that are \u201cbeyond imagination\u201d according to one resident. This jam could last for one, three, even five hours \u2014 last year, one stretched for 30 miles.",
        "When he was arrested, the man accused of killing nine people during a Bible study in a Charleston church had a list of other local black churches in his car, law enforcement officials testified on Monday. During roughly two hours on the stand, former state law enforcement division agent Brittany Burke testified that names of a handful of other churches and their addresses were found on a handwritten list in a backpack in Dylann Roof\u2019s car.",
        "Everyone I know is tense about New Year\u2019s Eve. The superstition is that if the evening itself is appalling, that\u2019s how the next year is going to be. We need to be in the company of people we love, or at least like, and with strangers who might become friends. With this in mind, some years ago I decided to host a party. On the morning of the big night, I woke up to find that the left side of my face had swollen up. My cheek looked like a red leather boxing glove.",
        "Ronda Rousey, the UFC\u2019s most popular female fighter, will fight for the first time in more than a year on 30 December when she faces Amanda Nunes in a bantamweight title fight at UFC 207. Rousey\u2019s return has been anticipated for some time as she recovered from injuries suffered in her upset loss to Holly Holm in UFC 193 and an unrelated knee surgery this past summer. Originally, the UFC had hoped she would return to fight Holm in their signature UFC 200 card in July but that was delayed because of her surgery.",
        "It could have been a cold war drama. The world watched this week as accusations and were thrown by the American and Russian governments about documents stolen during a hack of the Democratic National Committee and the email account of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chair John Podesta. The notion that public figures have any right to privacy appears to have been lost in the furore surrounding the story, stolen correspondence being bandied around in attempts to influence the outcome of one of the nastiest, most vitriolic US presidential campaigns in history.",
        "Accusations of betrayal. Demagoguery and hatred. The bunker in Berlin. Comparisons with Adolf Hitler have been tempting throughout Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign for the presidency \u2014 never more so than at its mad, destructive climax. The Republican\u2019s presidential bid appears to have become the campaign equivalent of the last days of the reich, when Germany\u2019s leadership raged at bearers of bad news from the battlefield, ordered divisions to launch counteroffensives, and embraced a nihilistic plan to burn it all down and take everyone along.",
        "Anton Chekhov\u2019s The Cherry Orchard ends with the aged servant Firs, a former serf, alone on the deserted stage. \u201cLife\u2019s gone by like I never lived,\u201d he says. In Stephen Karam\u2019s new version, which opens at New York\u2019s Roundabout next month, the legendary actor Joel Grey plays Firs. That mournful sentiment is not one that Grey entirely shares. The Tony and actor, now 84, has led an agreeably eventful life.",
        "A federal judge, saying \u201ctime is of the essence\u201d as the new academic year approaches, ruled on Friday that the University of North Carolina temporarily cannot block two transgender students and an employee from using bathrooms that match their gender identity. One transgender rights organisation welcomed the ruling which affects but does not strike down what it called \u201ca dangerous and bigoted law\u201d. US district judge Thomas Schroeder partially granted a preliminary injunction to the students and the employee in response to a lawsuit challenging a state law limiting protections for LGBT people.",
        "His first campaign during the Vancouver mayoral election hinged on a deceptively simple idea: housing is a human right. In 2008, as he stumped through this city of some 600, 000 people Gregor Robertson vowed to boost affordable housing and end homelessness. Eight years later, Robertson is into his third term as mayor. Housing remains one of the top issues facing the city, but the battle has been recast.",
        "There is not much more brutal in football than a goal and, for England, it was a numbing sense of disappointment at the final whistle. They have waited an awfully long time to win their opening match of a European Championship and the clock had ticked into its third minute of stoppage time when their chance to end that long run, stretching back to 1980, was wrenched from their grasp."
