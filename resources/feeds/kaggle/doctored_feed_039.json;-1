        "There has been much legal wringing in the \u201c Never Trump \u201d book about whether evangelicals will vote for Trump. Many will. And the reasons why are fear, preference and prejudice. Trump has said : \u201c Evangelicals understand me better than anybody. \u201d Perhaps they do. They believe he \u2019 s pandering to them, and they are happy to be pandered to \u2014 as long as their business interests and power remain viable. Trump, despite his divorces and \u201c worldly lifestyle \u201d appeals to evangelicals because he is old, powerful and pays them immense service.",
        "Since creator Hugh Warner developed the character of Marilyn Monroe in the early 90s, his asymmetrical alien appearance has been a constant presence in life. But despite a lack of reinvention over the last two decades, his influence in culture has entirely vanished. Last year, Manson told the Guardian that he made a fake world for himself because he didn \u2019 t want the one that he lived in. He might still not like this world but, increasingly, the world rejected him.",
        "Syrian opposition groups wrote to the United States on Sunday, said they would \u201c cooperate positively \u201d with a ceasefire but, according to two Syrian officials, had deep reservations about details of the deal as relayed to them. The ceasefire was signed between Russia, which backs the incumbent president, Bashar and the United States, which backs some rebel fighters, to come into effect at noon on Monday and excludes some jihadi groups.",
        "The manager of an oil warehouse that was destroyed in a brush fire last week has said he is \u201c incredibly responsible \u201d for the blaze, which erupted during a rally and killed at least 36 people. The fire, in Oakland \u2019 s Fruitvale area, was the deadliest in the city \u2019 s history, despite the area \u2019 s vibrant fine arts scene. None of the victims were artists or performers and were part of a community. The neighborhood, known as the \u201c Ghost Fire \u201d had a history of complaints for perceived violations of the fire code. The fire started there at August 11.",
        "\u201c Hello. I just found out that I am four weeks pregnant. \u201c I cannot carry on with this relationship for numerous reasons and I need to have an abortion. Though it is an option for me in the United States, in Australia, it is not really an option because the $ $ 700 to have it happen is simply out of the question. \u201c I \u2019 m glad you can advise me and are able to understand. I am absolutely desperate. \u201d Beth read through her email once again and traced her finger over the send key.",
        "I \u2019 m agoraphobic, which means that I usually deal with irrational thoughts related to travel. Even in childhood, travel often sent me into a nauseous, sweaty heart attack. It hasn \u2019 t kept me housebound since a brief, harrowing period in my early twenties, but those memories stay with me. In some way, every action I take is a small comfort for the suicidal, terrified young girl I was back then, a girl whose closest thing to a husband was walking down the driveway clutching her parents \u2019 hands and grinning, \u201c OK. This is enough for today.",
        "The bell rang at Billy and Janice Miller \u2019 s modest townhouse in Oxnard, California, dated one September morning in 1993. This is odd, Billy thought, opening the door. They had just awakened after a day at the Ventura county fair with their son Billy Jr, and weren \u2019 t expecting much. Upstairs, he could hear Janice preparing the child for a ride. He looked outside and noticed only their quiet neighborhood house and the retirement apartments along the way. Then he glanced down.",
        "Late season had turned to early game, and if the Cleveland Indians \u2019 game hadn \u2019 t been indignity enough, their manager Dan Francona had become a prisoner in his own thoughts. He left a postgame interview in a locker beneath the stands, and turned to walk back to the club \u2019 s clubhouse \u2014 only to run into a crowd of fans leaving Cincinnati \u2019 s Game 6 World Series loss to the Chicago Cubs. The crowd was filtered through security barriers set up in the stadium, forcing Francona and a team public relations man to move as the fans pushed through.",
        "The fall of northern Aleppo now appears likely, forces having reclaimed almost all the areas in days. It will be the beginning of the end for the Syrian Army, who swept into the city in 2012, jubilant at the idea of overthrowing Bashar but who in recent months have helped defeat approach inexorably. Russian airstrikes the west \u2019 s decision not to interfere militarily and its diplomatic weakness Turkey and others \u2019 decision to fall back on attempts to oust President Assad and the election of Donald Trump not Hillary Clinton all run in one direction.",
        "Laura Benanti made a repeat visit to The Lucy Show with Stephen Colbert to deliver another sketch of Melania Trump. The Tony Awards returned to parody the celebrity turned potential leading lady \u2019 s interview with Susan Cooper on Monday. \u201c I refuse to be my husband \u2018 those words are very nice \u2019 plus he said them on a bus \u2014 disgusting, \u201d she said, while repeating the controversial leaked videos of Donald Trump complaining about women in a lewd manner. \u201c He claimed that it was locker room protocol, \u201d she said.",
        "Proposals for the \u201c first independent state in space \u201d have been developed by a team of scientists and space experts, who say the concept will foster peace, free up access to space resources and offer protection for inhabitants of planet Earth. Dubbed \u201c Asgardia \u201d after one of the mythical worlds created by the Norse gods, the researchers say the \u201c new UN \u201d will eventually become a part of the United Nations, with its own logo and anthem devised by representatives of the public through a series of concerts.",
        "In his last speech of the year, John Bush talked about how his own show provided comforting political catharsis to audiences who already agreed with him. \u201c There \u2019 s nothing inherently wrong with shows that have a saying this show has a viewpoint, \u201d he says. \u201c But a healthy media audience has to be broader than that. And the way we watch news now is. \u201d He \u2019 s not the only one who \u2019 s lying. Barack Obama tells the New Yorker that new media \u2019 s capacity to spread misinformation makes it \u201c very difficult to have a good conversation \u201d.",
        "It is always a risk to read too much into friendlies but the intensity shown by Liverpool here suggested that, after a mixed they are almost ready for the real business. Sadio Man\u00e9 looked blisteringly sharp on the right, while there was a defensive resilience to a partnership of Dejan Lovren and Ragnar Klavan. But arguably the most promising aspect was that the first three goals came from pressing high up the pitch. J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s style is beginning to take hold and it will be fascinating to see how effective it is over the coming weeks.",
        "The police officer who killed a black motorist in a shooting whose bloody aftermath was livestreamed on Facebook was defended by his chief on Wednesday as a member of the force with \u201ca real sound ability when it comes to communicating and relating to people\u201d. In an interview with the Associated Press, St Anthony police chief Jon Mangseth sketched a portrait at odds with the image of the officer screaming expletives while pointing his gun at the dying man in the video.",
        "A shadow is cast long upon New York by the ghost of Robert Moses, the titan \u201cmaster builder\u201d of 20th century whose almost unrivalled power to chart his vision of urban renewal fostered the and public metropolis that is, for better or worse, one of Gotham\u2019s most enduring legacies. But pedestrianism among advocates and urban planners in the new, young century has been on the ascent in global cities far and wide, with many pushing for more restrictions on cars in the interests of bipeds and cyclists.",
        "propaganda broadcaster Hanoi Hannah, famous for urging American GIs to leave her country during the Vietnam war, has died at the age of 87. The radio presenter, whose real name was Trinh Thi Ngo, was among dozens of Vietnamese journalists drafted in by the Communist regime to inundate the country with rhetoric during the conflict that ended in 1975 with the fall of Saigon and America\u2019s defeat. \u201cGI, your government has abandoned you. They have ordered you to die,\u201d she said in one of her appeals in English during the war. \u201cDon\u2019t trust them.",
        "It was never supposed to go to a Game 7. When the Golden State Warriors took a commanding NBA finals lead by beating the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 4, it looked like the only remaining drama would be about which player on the Warriors would win MVP. Then the Cavaliers took advantage of Draymond Green\u2019s suspension and won Game 5 on the road. Then, on Thursday, they dominated the Warriors for all 48 minutes of Game 6 and tied up the series. Now we have a Game 7, where, as they say, anything is possible.",
        "Our pop stars are mad as hell, and they\u2019re not going to take it anymore. From reigning chart queens Beyonce and Adele, to rock gods such as Jack White, indie icons like Wilco and boomer mainstays such as Peter Frampton, the call from the stage to the audience to put down the goddamn phone is sounding louder, and clearer, than an annoying ringtone interrupting a concert. Musicians are so sick of staring out at the backs of thousands of phones and tablets filming them, that they are taking increasingly extreme measures.",
        "Tom Brady, the New England Patriots quarterback, said on Friday it was a \u201cpersonal decision\u201d not to pursue a legal challenge to his Deflategate suspension. \u201cI\u2019ve just tried to move on from it,\u201d he said on Friday after practice. \u201cI\u2019ll be excited to be back when I\u2019m back, and I\u2019ll be cheering our team and hopefully we\u2019ll go out and win every game. \u201d The will miss the first four games of this season for his role in the scandal.",
        "Edward Snowden has set out the case for Barack Obama granting him a pardon before the US president leaves office in January, arguing that the disclosure of the scale of surveillance by US and British intelligence agencies was not only morally right but had left citizens better off. The US whistleblower\u2019s comments, made in an interview with the Guardian, came as supporters, including his US lawyer, stepped up a campaign for a presidential pardon. Snowden is wanted in the US, where he is accused of violating the Espionage Act and faces at least 30 years in jail.",
        "The acclaimed western Hell or High Water may pivot on a conflict between disenfranchised brothers (Chris Pine and Ben Foster) Texas law men (Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham) and the corporate . However, it\u2019s driven less by traditional action theatrics than by people sitting, surveying their space, drinking in their perverted, disappointing patch of Americana. The film is mythic, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s poignant: it wants to be a great and timely western.",
        "For years, journalists have treated American gun violence as an hopeless problem. They cover the latest mass shooting, they write about congressional inaction, and then they move on. We\u2019re not doing that. Early this year, the Guardian hired me as one of the country\u2019s only gun politics reporters. My job was to help us begin to understand why the gun debate is so broken \u2014 and what it would actually take to fix it. America\u2019s gun violence problem is so much bigger than mass shootings.",
        "The principal owners of the professional sports teams in the four major North American leagues skew heavily conservative, with contributions to Republican campaigns, candidates and Super Pacs exceeding donations to Democratic efforts nearly tenfold according to Federal Election Commission records. Nearly all of the owners of MLB, NFL, NBA and NHL franchises were active political donors during this election cycle, contributing more than $26. 6m to various political campaigns and political action committees. A total of $23, 378, 415. 28 was designated for candidates or committees with Republican leanings, while $2, 728, 868. 70 was contributed toward Democratic causes.",
        "Our new series, the divorce survival guide, hosts writers discussing the most bitter cut of all: the end of a marriage, Last November, my husband sat me down on the living room floor and told me he didn\u2019t see a future for us. The abrupt end of my relationship left me feeling blindsided and disoriented, and my brain parsed the event as a trauma.",
        "Two tentatively improving teams seek to confirm progress at Old Trafford. Despite a series of frustrating draws, Manchester United have found an encouraging attacking groove in recent weeks and are turning into a very different, and much more vibrant, team than they were under Louis van Gaal. So Toby Alderweireld\u2019s return to action for Tottenham in midweek was well timed as Spurs are likely to need their best at Old Trafford on Sunday.",
        "Edward Snowden\u2019s face seems ever present in Berlin, where stickers on doors and promise there\u2019s always \u201cA bed for Snowden\u201d and posters plug Oliver Stone\u2019s eponymous film. The whistleblower\u2019s explosive 2013 revelations about international government surveillance generated some good advertising for Berlin, cementing its reputation as hipster technology activist capital of the world. The city\u2019s cheap lifestyle and world war aversion to surveillance, as well as sympathetic Germany residency rules, have created a powerful network of support and infrastructure for its dedicated cyberactivism community. We are \u201cpoor, but sexy\u201d its residents like to say.",
        "A new bill proposing restrictions on lucrative and controversial farm promotion programs is expected to be introduced by Utah Republican senator Mike Lee and New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker on Thursday. The move would affect the American Egg Board, the body revealed by the Guardian last year to have used its funds to wage a massive and secret campaign against Hampton Creek, a startup selling mayonnaise.",
        "A multimillionaire former star trader at Barclays is expected to receive a prison sentence, along with three former colleagues, after being convicted for his role as ringleader in a transatlantic plot to manipulate Libor interest rates a decade ago. During a trial at Southwark crown court, the gave various explanations for their behaviour: they did not believe it to be dishonest, their bosses condoned it and some had been subjected to intimidation.",
        "Aaron Pryor, the relentless junior welterweight who fought two memorable bouts with Alexis Arguello, has died. He was 60. Pryor\u2019s family issued a statement saying the boxer died at his home in Cincinnati after a long battle with heart disease. Known as \u201cthe Hawk\u201d Pryor was a crowd favorite who fought with a frenetic style, rarely if ever taking a step backward. His fights in the early 1980s with Arguello, the great Nicaraguan champion, were both classics that are still talked about in boxing circles.",
        "Donald Trump called Evan McMullin the \u201cpuppet\u201d of a \u201closer\u201d on Saturday, prompting the candidate who threatens to beat Trump in Utah to retort that the Republican nominee was \u201cdeeply corrupt\u201d. McMullin launched his quixotic presidential campaign in August, presenting himself as an alternative for conservatives who do not want to vote for Trump. A Mormon and former operative with the CIA, McMullin has shot into competition in his native Utah."
