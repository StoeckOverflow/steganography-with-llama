        "Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the former Chilean prime minister, will be the first UN secretary General, after the security council decides he should replace Ban at the beginning of next year. In a public show of unity, all 15 ambassadors from the security council emerged from the floor in a series of straw votes to announce that they had agreed on Guterres, who was UN high commissioner for Portugal for a decade, and that they would announce the choice in a formal conference on Thursday.",
        "The alarm rang and in a blink the base thrummed with sound. Smokejumpers grabbed helmets, donned kevlar boots, tested radios and hopped on parachutes. A speaker blasted Mozart \u2019 s Ride of the Valkyries. \u201c Final Test, OK, let \u2019 s see, \u201d boomed a command. Within minutes eight smokejumpers were airborne in a Twin Otter, climbing into a blue blue sky. The plane promptly returned, empty, to pick up another eight jumpers. Below them stretched wilderness with names such as Hells Angels, Thunderbolt Mountain and River of No Return : America \u2019 s rugged, spectacularly forested west \u2014 the part that mattered.",
        "The world is careening towards an environment never witnessed before by humans, with the temperature of the planet and oceans breaking apart, sea levels approaching historic highs and carbon dioxide surpassing a key milestone, a new international report has reached. The \u201c state of the climate \u201d debate, led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( Noaa ) with input from hundreds of experts from 62 countries, confirmed there was a \u201c toppling of key symbolic mileposts \u201d in heat, sea level rise and adverse weather in 2015.",
        "It \u2019 s hard to find two political conferences more dissimilar than the ones we \u2019 ve watched this past month. The Democratic and Republican gatherings have played out as a lesson in differences : hope against love love against hate. And perhaps most starkly, they \u2019 ve demonstrated a shocking trend in gender politics \u2014 especially against Republican fakery. On Monday afternoon, the DNC stage hosted people talking about everything from political equity to disability equality.",
        "The information we \u2019 re sending about nutrition \u2014 about what \u2019 s behind certain illnesses like heart disease, Alzheimer \u2019 s and cancer \u2014 is within a box. I want to help you outside a box. Into a field where there are fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables are way more clever than scientists think and I am here to help you unleash their effects. For instance, did you know that three figs in multiples of nine is guaranteed to produce cancer?",
        "It turns out black women don \u2019 t care about Clinton \u2019 s sexism \u2014 nor that Clinton is a woman. A lot of white women vote for Trump. And while Clinton did control the female vote nationally, her advantage among men was a percentage point bigger than Obama had enjoyed over Clinton in 2012. This has left many white feminists reeling. Just how did this happen, they ask? Ann Dunham, one of many rich, rich, celebrities who deliberately do not impress the voters of today, mourned that white women had been \u201c so hard to see the unity of national identity \u201d.",
        "A single man could face three years in jail in Texas for selling homemade ceviche and chicken stuffed fried avocado on Facebook after law enforcement conducted an investigative operation and accused her of owning a food business without a permit. The story of Mariza Ruelas \u2019 charges has gone viral since the Stockton woman finds out about police targeting her in an alleged investigation of a local eating group that members like to share recipes, perform potlucks and sell dishes.",
        "Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the least popular French president since the second world war, has announced he will not run for a second term in France. With a satisfaction rating so low it recently dropped to just 4 % the new president appeared angry and emotional as he said in a special televised address from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e newspaper that he would not attempt to stand for a second term, one of the \u201c risks \u201d to the French nation if he did so.",
        "In the autumn of 2011, not long after protestors took over New York \u2019 s Zuccotti Park, a demonstration of fewer than a hundred marched through the streets in a small midwestern town to inaugurate Occupy Muncie. After a brief show of jazz bands they chose to set up a small encampment near City Park. \u201c The rest of the town actually didn \u2019 t know we were there, \u201d said a former local campaigner who was involved but refused to give her name because, she wrote, \u201c Others have done so much more.",
        "days before the beginning of the Olympics, the governor of Rio de Janeiro has declared a state of financial emergency and begged for federal intervention to avoid a \u201c total collapse in public security, finance, education, transport and emergency management \u201d. The plea for reform is an embarrassment for the host of North America \u2019 s first Games and adds to a long series of woes that includes the impeachment of the president, the biggest recession in decades, the first corruption scandal in Chile, the Zika epidemic and a wave of occupations and occupations of government employees.",
        "Please sit down, I have something shocking to offer you. In fact, best make sure you have a glass of juice nearby. Okay, here goes. Bill and Hillary Lindsey \u2019 s marriage may be some kind of \u2026 arrangement. Wait, why haven \u2019 t you pulled out? Why are you giving me a look that suggests \u201c you don \u2019 t have any firsthand proof of this? \u201d and \u201c who gives a fuck? \u201d Clearly you need to devote, er, I mean, devote an hour and forty minutes of your time watching Playboy, Inc. in which a number of with personal agendas will bombard you with specious allegations.",
        "NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden and actor Daniel Radcliffe will appear together in a play starting on Saturday in New York City. The play, Privacy, premiered in London in 2014 and has been refashioned for the new theatre. It was inspired by Snowden \u2019 s revelations that the US government was conducting massive surveillance on its citizens. Radcliffe and Snowden ran lines every week to rehearse the show, according to the New York stage, though Radcliffe was in a Moscow auditorium speaking to Snowden on radio from Moscow, where he has lived since June 2013.",
        "On a Saturday in late October, in the Boston suburb of Revere, an organization called the Fatherhood Project held a scheduled playgroup for dads and kids. About 10 dads showed up that day. Some of the fathers had grown up in north Africa or eastern Europe, and some in greater Boston. There were single dads, dads with partial custody, and married dads. Fathers and children sat in a circle on the floor while John Badalament, the director of programs, led them in singing Baby Beluga and The Wheels on the Bus.",
        "At the University of Massachusetts Amherst, students can order sushi in the cafeteria or wings and pizza delivered until 1am. Photos of salmon fillets laid atop asparagus sticks and spoonfuls of lemony quinoa adorn the school\u2019s dining guide. For all its efforts, the university was recently ranked at the top of the Princeton Review\u2019s \u201cbest campus food\u201d list. The university is just one example of how schools nationwide have sought to upgrade dining halls from cafeterias to lifestyle purveyors.",
        "Neither Super Bowls, nor frivolous NFL prediction games are won in September. Veteran participants in our Pick Six contest will know that one strong week can easily melt away into a midseason mess of analysis paralysis and unjustifiable faith in Chip Kelly. But there is a certain special kind of glory that comes with calling all six games correctly on the opening weekend. And it is only made better by knowing that nobody else achieved the same. So step forward, stephentheaardvark, take a bow and give the little people a wave.",
        "I met Jenny, and fell in love with her, in 1999. The following year, when it seemed we might get along together for more than a few weeks or months, Jenny decided to sell her flat in north London and move to Cambridge, to the house across the road from me (\u201cI haven\u2019t entirely lost my mind: I\u2019m not actually going to live with him,\u201d she wrote). After six more years of testing the water, she moved again, across the road, and we lived together in this newly extended Victorian house for the rest of her life.",
        "An awkward grey creature stands on the edge of Frihamnen harbour in Gothenburg. It looks like a homemade robot elephant, cobbled together from industrial remains strewn around the dock. Clad in rusty sheets of corrugated steel, its truncated body stands on gawky little legs, lurching this way and that with cartoonish wonkiness. \u201cWe wanted people to be curious about what this thing could be,\u201d says Francesco Apuzzo of Raumlabor, the architectural collective behind this mysterious structure. It could be the chubby cousin of one of the killing machines from Star Wars, but it has a more benign purpose.",
        "Health officials have announced the first case of Zika transmitted by local mosquitoes in Texas, the second state in the country to find local mosquitoes apparently carrying the virus. The tropical virus through Latin America and the Caribbean in the last year, first arriving in the United States in the territory of Puerto Rico, before arriving in Miami, Florida. Zika can cause severe birth defects in pregnant women infected with the disease.",
        "Tuesday\u2019s murder of an priest in Normandy by Isis sympathisers was surprising for two reasons. Until now, Isis had avoided attacking religious leaders in the west who had not directly harmed Muslims, in line with the prophet Muhammad\u2019s command. And French security forces had been monitoring both perpetrators for trying to join Isis in Syria. One of the teenage assassins was wearing an electronic bracelet, and foreign intelligence sources had provided a photograph of the other as preparing for an imminent attack.",
        "Google has just launched a new smartphone, the Pixel, and for the first time this isn\u2019t just another Android smartphone \u2014 it\u2019s a Google phone. The company is finally launching a direct assault on its biggest rival: Apple. For years Google has been involved in a proxy war with the iPhone maker.

        "On 22 June 2015, Xavier Justo, a retired Swiss banker, walked towards the front door of his brand new boutique hotel on Koh Samui, a tropical Thai island. He had spent the past three years building the luxurious complex of chalets and apartments overlooking the shimmering sea and was almost ready to open for business. All he needed was a licence. Justo had arrived in Thailand four years earlier, having fled the drab world of finance in London.",

        "The finding that Rolling Stone magazine defamed a University of Virginia administrator is the latest in a series of legal decisions that experts say signal a hardening attitude to the media and other institutions. A jury on Friday found that Rolling Stone and writer Sabrina Rudin Erdely met the extraordinary standard of acting with \u201cactual malice\u201d in their depictions of Nicole Eramo, the university\u2019s former associate dean. In her lawsuit for $7. 5m, Eramo claimed the publication\u2019s story cast her as the \u201cchief villain\u201d who \u201csilenced\u201d Jackie or \u201cdiscouraged\u201d her from reporting her alleged rape to police.",
        "America\u2019s streets are full of what the fashion industry labels \u201c women\u201d \u2014 far more than we previously thought. Thanks to a new study, we now know that the average woman is around a size 20. Not, as previously believed, a size 14. That means that the disconnect between the clothes in store windows and the bodies of women walking past them is greater than we had ever assumed. Despite this, major fashion brands still refuse to accept the bodies of their customers.",
        "The world\u2019s oldest approximately 23, 000 years old, have been found in a cave on Okinawa Island off the coast of Japan. Researchers say the made from the shells of sea snails and found in the Sakitari cave, show the development of fishing technology at an earlier stage than previously thought and more widespread than previously known. Humans are believed to have moved offshore to Okinawa and its sister islands about 50, 000 years ago, but much of the history of their adaptation to life there and the evolution of maritime technology is unknown.",
        "Nocturnal Animals delivers a double shot of horror and Nabokovian despair: it\u2019s excessive, outrageous, a story within a story about the and . Director Tom Ford has adapted Austin Wright\u2019s 1993 novel Tony and Susan, magnifying its cruelties and ironies, and bringing to it a sheen of hardcore porn and pure provocation. This movie had its premiere at Venice earlier this year, and it was every bit as horribly gripping and intimately upsetting this second time around.",
        "A nearly $15bn settlement over Volkswagen\u2019s emissions cheating scandal cleared a key hurdle on Tuesday, with a federal judge giving preliminary approval to the deal that includes an option for owners to have the carmaker buy back their vehicles.

        "After apparently abolishing the need for food with a drink, which spawned a $100m startup, Rob Rhinehart had another epiphany: plonk a shipping container on a hill overlooking Los Angeles. The red metal hulk would be his home, an with solar panels and panoramic views that would set a new benchmark in hip, minimalist living. The CEO and founder of Soylent bought a patch of scrub in an area known as Flat Top to begin an \u201cexperiment in sustainable living\u201d early this year. It has not gone well.",
