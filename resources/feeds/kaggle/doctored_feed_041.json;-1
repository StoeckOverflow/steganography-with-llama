        "Nearly 33 billion Americans \u2014 more than 10 % of the country \u2019 s population \u2014 have no health insurance. While the very poorest are eligible to Medicaid coverage, millions more individuals fail to qualify, but remain too poor to pay for universal health insurance. Among those who do qualify for subsidised plans or refuse to pay insurance policy, paying for minor checks such as fillings and eye tests is usually a problem, as they may not be supported by basic healthcare services.",
        "The last time I saw Michael Cimino was probably the first time I actually saw him \u2014 at the Venice film festival in 2012. He was presenting a live, digitally remastered version of his 1980 epic Heaven \u2019 s Door which famously flopped horribly leading to an agonisingly slow and still steady process of critical failure. The Venice event caused Cimino to luxuriate in the way this film was now viewed in Europe. I was invited to a concert on a palazzo terrace overlooking the Lido where Cimino was happy to be present. The excitement was palpable.",
        "Scientific evidence of starvation has been extracted from the records of people who died in the Great Famine in 19th century Ireland. It is the first time analysis of the carbon isotopes of nitrogen and carbon in human teeth has been used to locate markers for starvation. Some of the cases studied by Julia Taylor of the University of Bradford, and Mary Montgomery of Durham University, had survived earlier centuries of famine before the Great Famine of when the common potato crop on which the population were dependent totally collapsed in successive years.",
        "\u201c You \u2019 ll find your brother. \u201d The woman with long, multicolored braids and a long fur coat ties a wristband over my hand and gestures into the crowd. \u201c Sorry, where do we go? \u201d It \u2019 s 1am on Thursday night at Symbiosis Gathering, a nightclub in Oakdale, California. After a day at camp and a long drive, my dad and I are hoping to pitch our tent as soon as possible. \u201c Just drive that way, \u201d she says, softly. \u201c You \u2019 ll figure it out. \u201d We lock eyes and her gaze is gentle but insistent.",
        "The actor Marion Cotillard has issued a statement claiming involvement in the forthcoming deaths of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Rumours of a relationship between the star of La Vie en Rose and Pitt, with whom she appears in upcoming first world war film Allied, began circulating the same day as the announcement and were confirmed on Wednesday by reports that the star was pregnant.",
        "My dad and I have been rehabbing my front porch this fall. We \u2019 ve done most of the work ourselves but for certain things we \u2019 ve hired help, and so I \u2019 ve been working some afternoons with an electrician and a painter. They are kind, supportive. I \u2019 m always happy to find them in their trucks, backing into the wall. The electrician went to school with two of my younger brothers and lived for a short time at my dad \u2019 s house when he was a teenager. Now he \u2019 s a Marine and a former marine, something that makes me proud of him.",
        "Russian media are looking into a disturbing image of a bear being crushed to death by a group of men riding in vehicles over Siberian tundra. In the event, apparently shot by two of the assailants, two trucks reportedly used by Russian miners and mining workers in Canada repeatedly drive over a polar bear sitting in the road. Investigators in Russia \u2019 s Yakutia region, which encompasses the Siberian Arctic, stated they were examining the incident to determine whether it constitutes an animal cruelty criminal offense.",
        "After Jeree Brown \u2019 s husband, Jabaro, was diagnosed with autism in 2014, the first public school refused to acknowledge the condition, let alone address it, she said, even as the city was mired in a soil contamination crisis that might have had a dramatic impact on people with special needs. \u201c I arranged for him to have speech therapy \u2014 he was grateful for that, \u201d she said. Brown is one of 15 named plaintiffs in an expansive federal lawsuit filed Tuesday that alleges the school district has denied primary education services to students in the aftermath of Flint \u2019 s energy crisis.",
        "J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann is still in possession of a coherent style for the senior men \u2019 s national team and, after defeat to Colombia in the South America opener, he \u2019 s left in search of a point. A loss to the team in the world \u2014 by Fifa \u2019 s estimation at least \u2014 is hardly a disgrace but the lack of support shown by the US on a sweltering pitch in Santa Clara was shocking, and will do little to give their people confidence the hosts can make any real impact on the tournament.",
        "Donald Trump scheduled a series of interviews with close allies and political veterans this week, stoking interest about his possible cabinet appointment \u2014 just as he did this summer, when he polled crowds about his running mate and floated improbable results to the press. Trump has sought to decide nominations to run the US \u2019 s powerful foreign agencies, though have also made most of their nominations in vain. So far he has made nine nominations, and his aides have leaked out a dozen possible names for other presidential positions.",
        "Hours before Hillary Clinton accepted the Democratic presidential nomination at the Republican \u2019 s convention in Philadelphia, John Elmets walked on to the stage. Just 18 months ago, his speech would have been unthinkable. \u201c It \u2019 s an honor to be here, and candidly, it \u2019 s also a celebration, \u201d said Elmets, a former advisor and speechwriter for Ronald Reagan. The lack of Republicans who support Clinton, such as Elmets, is one of many major twists in an extraordinary American election cycle. Conservative men and women have selected their natural nominee in lieu of a candidate their party has spent two decades running down.",
        "Like many people of a certain generation, I recently began selling Snapchat, after years of shunning it in favor of social media apps meant for people who still draw with all their fingers and not just their thumbs. And I \u2019 m not surprised. Of the 150 million people who use Snapchat each day, the number of Internet users over 35 has increased from 2 % in 2013 to 14 % today, we learned this week from ComScore.",
        "Michael Shannon\u2019s coiled intensity has been put to menacingly effective use playing villainous types in Man of Steel and, most recently, 99 Homes. But Matthew M Ross\u2019s seductive first feature, Frank Lola, exploits Shannon\u2019s sex appeal too. Ross opens his noir romance boldly with a heated scene between the titular lovers, who just met that night. \u201cCome on, just fuck me,\u201d Lola (Imogen Poots) pleads, bored with the foreplay. A torrid scene ensues. The opening sets the tone: dark and sexy.",
        "The former University of California, Berkeley law dean who was found to have violated sexual harassment policies has returned to campus as a professor, sparking outrage from the woman at the center of the controversy who said his presence could \u201csilence victims from coming forward\u201d. Sujit Choudhry \u2014 who resigned in March as head of the prestigious law school, in a case that sparked a national debate about discrimination on college campuses \u2014 is returning to his Berkeley office where administrators say he will be working this fall.",
        "Sergio Ramos did it again. The cl\u00e1sico was heading into its last minute and Real Madrid were facing the end of a unbeaten run, when the man who rescued them in the 94th minute of the 2014 European Cup final leapt to head in another Luka Modric delivery and score another dramatic equaliser. And, while it could never be as significant as that night in Lisbon, it could prove a huge moment too \u2014 one that will go some way to defining the title race in Spain. \u201cIn games like this, Sergio is always there,\u201d Zinedine Zidane said.",
        "Spend 25 years on any job and you\u2019re bound to have a little down time. Kirsten Johnson has worked for decades as a cinematographer on many acclaimed documentaries, travelling to places such as Bosnia, Darfur, Kabul and Texas. Wisely, she always kept her camera running and didn\u2019t throw away the spare footage. By collecting and curating \u201cleftover stock\u201d for her experimental film Cameraperson, she has made more than just a record of \u201cwhat I did at the office\u201d. It is a remarkable document about the creative process in the service of a specific goal.",
        "Donald Trump has said he supports a controversial oil pipeline that runs next to a Native American reservation in North Dakota \u2014 a project that the is personally invested in. A briefing from Trump\u2019s transition team said that the real estate magnate supports the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline and that his backing \u201chas nothing to do with his personal investments and everything to do with promoting policies that benefit all Americans\u201d.",
        "Amanda Knox will be the subject of a new Netflix documentary exploring the notorious Meredith Kercher murder case. The US student was convicted and imprisoned with Raffaele Sollecito for the 2007 murder of Kercher, but after appeals and retrials they were acquitted last year by Italy\u2019s highest court. Titled Amanda Knox, the documentary will premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival next month before a global launch on 30 September.",
        "For his directorial debut, Sleepwalk With Me, Mike Birbiglia did what so many comics do when assembling their crossover calling card: he made it about himself. Following loosely in the footsteps of Jerry Seinfeld, Roseanne Barr, and countless others, Birbiglia pulled from what he knew best in his 2012 film to play a comic who, like himself, suffers a severe sleepwalking disorder. The movie was culled from his show and book of the same name.",
        "Getting a message to Barack Obama just got easier. Just hit him up on Facebook. The White House unveiled a new feature on Wednesday that allows Facebook users to contact him via Messenger \u2014 just like they would any of their other friends on the site \u2014 using a chatbot. \u201cHi! It\u2019s great to hear from you \u2014 and we\u2019re excited to learn what\u2019s on your mind,\u201d a message from the White House Facebook page reads. It pops up automatically when you click the message button. The bot prompts you to click \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d before asking for your message.",
        "Until this month, there was no minimum age requirement to get married in Virginia \u2014 if you could meet certain criteria. Girls as young as 13 years old, and pregnant, were wed with a judge\u2019s approval in recent years, according to records from the Virginia department of health. Almost 4, 500 minors were married between 2004 and 2013. About 90% of those minors were girls who married adult men.",
        "Barack Obama paid tribute to Jo Cox, the British MP killed in June, in a meeting with her husband and young children at the White House on Friday. Brendan Cox tweeted: \u201cThe kids I met @POTUS today. He was excellent with the kids, we talked about Jo, fighting extremism the kids gave him their best drawings. \u201d Cox, 41, the Labour MP for Batley and Spen, was shot and stabbed to death outside Birstall public library in West Yorkshire on 16 June.",
        "It\u2019s hard to imagine a happy ending to the recount of this year\u2019s election results, spearheaded by Green party presidential candidate Jill Stein. Barring miracles in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania in the coming weeks, the challenge for the next four years remains the same: make Trump\u2019s job impossible, and build a visionary alternative to both his autocracy and Clinton\u2019s Third Way neoliberalism. Everything else is a distraction. Stein has been joined by dozens of lawyers and security experts, $5m in crowdfunding and Hillary Clinton in her recount efforts.",
        "Few names in American sport spark a reaction like the original North American Soccer League of the 1960s, 70s and 80s, a subject to be revisited each time the need arises for a lesson on how badly things can go wrong for football in the United States. The kitschy sexiness of the old NASL essentially collapsed under its own weight, a failed attempt to ramp up popularity for a very European brand of football in a recalcitrant United States.",
        "The year 2016 took Prince, David Bowie, Professor Snape and most of our sanity. But it has given us this video of a giant panda trying and failing to kill a snowman. Da Mao, a giant panda at the Toronto Zoo, faced off against a curiously snowman that his zookeepers constructed for his \u201cenrichment\u201d in a video viewed more than half a million times.",
        "Donald Trump has asked Goldman Sachs executive Gary Cohn to head his White House national economic council, a group that coordinates economic policy across agencies, NBC News reported on Friday. If elected, Cohn would be the third Goldman alumni picked to serve in the Trump administration: Steven Mnuchin, nominated to head the treasury department, and Steve Bannon, picked to be White House chief strategist, are both Sachs executives. Cohn, 56, is president and chief operating officer at the Wall Street firm and had until recently been widely considered the heir apparent to chief executive Lloyd Blankfein.",
        "Hari Nef is a American actor, model and activist, and is the first transgender model to be signed to a major modelling agency (IMG) and the first to land a glossy British cover (Elle). \u201cI was not the right girl. I was the lucky one in the right place at the right time. But people have been blazing this path for me for more than 50 years,\u201d she says. She describes herself, and her peers, as the new generation \u2014 \u201cbecause when we talk about previous generations, we\u2019re referring to people only five or 10 years ago\u201d.",
        "On 8 November, US presidential election night 2016, the Guardian Mobile Innovation Lab and the Guardian mobile apps team will offer an innovative way to get live presidential election results right on the lock screen of the Guardian\u2019s Android and iOS apps.

        "Fran\u00e7oise Gilot takes a stern line with interviewers, assuming they approach her with interest in only one thing: her affair with Picasso, which started 70 years ago and lasted a decade, during which time she had two children with the artist, before walking out. \u201cWhen people know nothing about you except one thing, you have to talk about that,\u201d she says, looking, at 94, much younger than her age.",
        "The California serial killer known as the Grim Sleeper has been sentenced to death for a homicidal spree which targeted poor black women over two decades. Lonnie Franklin, 63, a former garbage collector, appeared impassive as he was sentenced on Wednesday for murdering a teenage girl and nine women in southern Los Angeles between 1985 and 2007. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve done is not justifiable under the laws of God or laws of man,\u201d superior court judge Kathleen Kennedy told him as victims\u2019 relatives looked on, some in tears. Others sighed and said \u201camen\u201d."
