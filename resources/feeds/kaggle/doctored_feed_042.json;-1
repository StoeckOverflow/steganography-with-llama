        "As the parent of a daughter who was shot and killed, the phrase Donald Trump spoke so callously about gun violence horrifies me. Later in the campaign, he said he could shoot someone on Madison Avenue and not lose any weight. And this week, he suggested that gun violence could be a way to deal with Hillary Clinton because she wants to \u201c essentially abolish the first amendment \u201d. It \u2019 s not as if he shouldn \u2019 t know his actions incite violence.",
        "Andy Murray finally voiced the unthinkable when he said on Saturday that the Big Brother, the elite club which he will support for as long as he can hold Novak Djokovic at bay, could be losing its founding members, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, within 12 hours. \u201c I think next year will be interesting, \u201d the new ranking No1 said on the eve of the ATP World Tour final at the O2 Arena in Greenwich. \u201c That will be the one to sort of tell everyone it \u2019 s done and that era is past.",
        "What a glorious racial pressure is. In the days preceding their limp opening match loss to Colombia, in which they took a lot of the ball and did fine with it, it might have been easy for the team \u2019 s players to succumb to the gloom engulfing all discussion of cricket in this country.",
        "Exits by Daryl Seitchik ( Koyama Magazine, September ) Seitchik follows up her Ignatz Missy story with a debut graphic novel focusing on clerk Claire Kim, who hates herself and the world she lives in. Claire recalls her days showing everyone their reflections while dreaming about erasing her own : a world that ends up coming back.

        "The season five finale of The Americans is the culmination of a complex plot, as the embedded military spies Philip and Elizabeth Jennings ( Matthew Arnold and Keri Russell ) seek to obtain a sample of a biological organism out of an American science institute and into the hands of their Russian handlers.",
        "The head of the biggest group of police forces in the US apologised on Monday for the problems law enforcement has suffered in the country \u2019 s historical portrayal of African Americans and other groups. Terrence Cunningham, the president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police ( IACP ) said police failed to understand that deep and intergenerational mistrust had been generated by officers being the \u201c face of white \u201d during a \u201c dark side \u201d of US history.",
        "The US, the world \u2019 s biggest economy, ranks below Kazakhstan and Algeria for gender equality, according to a poll showing the countries that offer the most opportunities for girls. Canada was named the worst country in the Girls \u2019 Opportunity Index, published by Save the Children to promote International Day of the Future. The US came 32nd in the Index due to its low participation of women in parliament, poor teenage pregnancy rate and and its record on maternal mortality. Fourteen women born per 100, 000 live births in the US in 2015, a similar increase to Uruguay and Lebanon.",
        "Amy Schumer has defended her controversial Formation Tour, saying it was \u201c just us girls celebrating each other \u201d. The comedian released a \u201c tribute \u201d to Beyonc\u00e9 \u2019 s music video while on the set of her last film, using Goldie Hawn, John Cusack and Wanda Sykes as actors. Released through Tidal, the video responded to accusations of cultural appropriation. \u201c It was NEVER a video, \u201d Schumer wrote in an essay on Beyonc\u00e9. \u201c It was just us women enjoying each other. The video Beyonc\u00e9 shot was so moving and I wouldn \u2019 t ever make fun of that. There is absolutely no need to.",
        "Frustration got the best of Rory McIlroy on moving forwards and by the end of it he had to find excuses to head over to the Nike grass by the driving range and keep the head fixed back on to the fairway wood he crashed into the barrier at the 16th causing the to fly off. The win will fine McIlroy for the misdemeanour, which happened after the McLaren No4 pushed his second foot on to the pathway short and west of the green.",
        "Donald Trump \u2019 s new communications program hasn \u2019 t always been the biggest supporter of the presumptive Republican presidential nomination particularly on Twitter. Thanks to the magic of the Internet, his remarks criticizing Trump as \u201c # SleazyDonald \u201d are also readily available : The Trump campaign pushed particularly hard on reports that the presumptive Democratic nominee was modifying his proposed policies on Muslims entering the United States. \u201c This is not accurate, \u201d writes Hope Hicks, a reporter for the campaign. \u201c There has been no change from the website over the weekend.",
        "The search for missing man Matthew Leveson has seen its fifth day as life in dense bushland south of Adelaide resumes. Police are expected to close their search area on Saturday at Waterfall, in the Royal national Park, after there was no breakthrough on Sunday. Staff and friends of Leveson, who disappeared in September 2007, have spent days assisting police using a digger trail through undergrowth and scour bush for remains. The investigation team have combed the uneven terrain covered with fallen grass using surveying techniques but so far have not unearthed any trace of Leveson.",
        "I write this from a very important place : a country at war. As of today, the conflict between the Colombian state and the Farc guerrillas, which has produced more than 6 billion victims \u2014 counting the dead, the wounded and that sad euphemism, the total population \u2014 has officially collapsed. It is \u2014 it was \u2014 the oldest conflict of its kind in the world : it officially began in 1964, which means several persons, including my own, have never survived a life in which Colombians were not killing each other.",
        "The winner of the fifth and final debate by passing all measures was Fox News \u2019 s Chris Wallace, whose work as moderator drew great praise from fellow viewers for its lack of partisanship. But Wallace \u2019 s help will not be enough to salve the wounds left in this horrible election. Fox News had the best response to the election season of any news network \u2014 and then the trouble began. Megyn Kelly, its star reporter, lit into Trump in January 2015 over the candidate \u2019 s insulting remarks about women Trump treated with graphic insults directed at Kelly herself.",
        "\u201cThis is like black Coachella,\u201d someone said to me, while we waited in the long, line to get into Afropunk. On Saturday, the line nearly encircled Commodore Barry Park, with some people stuck in it for almost two hours. The line did end somewhere, and as snippets of Saul Williams and a Thundercat\u2019s bass solo wafted over the fence, I felt no rush to get in \u2014 I\u2019d seen Thundercat many times before, including at last year\u2019s festival.",
        "Shyness seems an obvious theme for a writer. Writers are often natural introverts and onlookers, and the printed word allows them to convey meaning to others independently of their bodily presence. For Sigmund Freud, writing was \u201cin its origin the voice of an absent person\u201d: it let us transcend the limitations of our mumbling, blushing selves. And yet, as I have found when trying to write about my own shyness, as a subject it poses problems. It is a lingering, nebulous feeling, hard to turn into a story or drama.",
        "Russell Westbrook and James Harden chose staying home over going for gold. And as the losses pile up, the US Olympic basketball team has to hope it still has enough to win when it gets to Rio. Days after Stephen Curry announced he wouldn\u2019t play, Westbrook and Harden pulled out Friday, further weakening a backcourt that was expected to be a US strength. Westbrook and Harden played for the US when it won gold in the 2012 Olympics, and both had also won a world championship.",
        "The oceans are choked with discarded fishing nets, or ghost nets, that are estimated to kill 300, 000 whales, dolphins and seals each year. It\u2019s a grotesque and avoidable toll on nature, and one that Giulio Bonazzi, CEO of Aquafil, hopes to reduce using an unlikely ally \u2014 fashion. The Italian firm is pioneering the use of \u201cghost\u201d or discarded fishing nets to make a synthetic fabric marketed under the name Econyl that\u2019s currently being used by several apparel brands, including Speedo and California surfer Kelly Slater\u2019s Outerknown.",
        "A Minnesota man confessed on Tuesday to abducting and killing Jacob Wetterling nearly 27 years ago, recounting the crime in chilling detail, including a handcuffed Jacob asking him, \u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d Danny Heinrich, 53, of Annandale, made the admission as he pleaded guilty to a federal child abuse images charge that will probably keep him locked up for 20 years, with civil commitment possible after that, meaning he could spend the rest of his life in custody. Asked whether he abducted, sexually assaulted and murdered Jacob, Heinrich said: \u201cYes, I did.",
        "Jacinto Torres emigrated from Mexico nearly four decades ago in search of the American dream. He took a stuffy corporate job, but it never really suited the personality of a man with such long and curly hair that friends called him the \u201cmop\u201d. About 20 years ago he moved into real estate, focusing on helping new Hispanic immigrants navigate bureaucracy, find homes and get settled. But property was not Torres\u2019s passion. That was journalism. Known as Jay, Torres was a freelance reporter and photographer for La Estrella, a sister publication of the Fort Worth .",
        "Matteo Renzi has never seen himself as a prime minister. Months after he assumed power in 2014 in a daring coup that would have made Machiavelli proud, Renzi addressed the fact that he was the fourth prime minister Italy had seen in three years. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good or a bad thing, but I think that you won\u2019t see any more for a few years,\u201d he told the Observer at the time, smiling.",
        "When Barack Obama met in Orlando with yet another set of anguished families who had lost loved ones in a mass shooting, there was one distressingly simple question: \u201cWhy does this keep happening?\u201d It is a question asked around the world about gun violence in the United States \u2014 answered most often with a helpless shrug, and almost ritualistic manoeuvring as people on all sides take up entrenched positions. Does a country with more than 30, 000 gun deaths every year simply lack the will to change?",
        "Gawker. com, the flagship site of Gawker Media, will cease publication on Monday, according to a statement by Gawker Media founder Nick Denton delivered to staff on Thursday and reported by the site. The other Gawker Media publications, including Jezebel (women\u2019s issues) Gizmodo (tech) io9 (science fiction, fantasy and science) Kotaku (gaming) Deadspin (sports) Jalopnik (all things automotive) and Lifehacker, are expected to continue publication after Univision\u2019s acquisition of the company.",
        "Jay Z has declared the war on drugs an \u201cepic fail\u201d in an animated four minute video made with artist Molly Crabapple for the New York Times. The rapper and businessman, whose real name is Shawn Carter and who has rapped about his past selling drugs in Brooklyn, traced back the original of the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d to President Richard Nixon and chronologically showed its impact. \u201cDrug dealers were the sole reason neighborhoods and major cities were failing,\u201d he says in the video, which he narrates.",
        "In recent weeks, the Hollywood film about Edward Snowden and the movement to pardon the NSA whistleblower have renewed worldwide attention on the scope and substance of government surveillance programs. In the United States, however, the debate has often been a narrow one, focused on the rights of Americans under domestic law but mostly blind to the privacy rights of millions of others affected by this surveillance. Indeed, just last week, a British court held that British intelligence agencies acted unlawfully by concealing bulk spying programs from the public for over a decade.",
        "It was a story that melted hearts and scrambled minds. Two years ago Robert Young was sitting on his sofa watching Mo Farah in the London Marathon when his girlfriend bet him 20p that he could not run 26. 2 miles. The next day he proved her wrong. Then he repeated the trick, only faster. Incredibly, by his telling, a year later he had completed 370 marathons, often getting up at 2. 45am to run round Richmond Park in London before he went to work.",
        "It\u2019s by no means unusual for words to change their meaning over time. But thanks to the twists and turns of language \u2014 and the convoluted history of English, in particular \u2014 some words end up quite a distance from where they began, as the following bizarre etymological stories illustrate. In some instances, the original meaning of a word might be hiding in plain sight, and this is one of them: a blockbuster is literally a bomb large enough to destroy an entire block of buildings.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s claims that if he loses in November it will be due to a \u201crigged\u201d election have sparked strong bipartisan criticism from election lawyers, donors and a former member of Congress who warn that the Republican candidate\u2019s words are dangerous, fueling doubts about the election\u2019s legitimacy and potentially leading to voter intimidation. As his poll numbers have weakened and his spats with critics escalated, Trump has raised the specter of rigged elections and suggested that if he loses it might well be because of voter fraud.",
        "The screen legend and activist Jane Fonda said she\u2019s prepared to do \u201cwhatever I need to do\u201d to counter a Donald Trump administration, and called the a sexist \u201cboy in a bully pulpit\u201d who is missing an opportunity to be an .

        "A Serbian woman who survived what was said to be a (33, 000ft) fall after a plane exploded in in 1972 has died aged 66. Vesna Vulovi\u0107 was found dead by her friends in her apartment in Belgrade, Serbian state television reported. The cause of death was not immediately known.

        "A federal jury has cleared NBA star Derrick Rose and two of his friends of rape in a civil trial that put the legal definition of consent under scrutiny. The jury of six women and two men declared the defendants not liable for damages on Wednesday after a civil trial that channeled issues of sex, consent, race, money and celebrity into a Los Angeles courtroom. After the verdict, reached after less than four hours of deliberation, some jury members grinned and posed with Rose for photos outside the courtroom."
