        "This is my last race of the year, and I want to play on one of the more depressing sentiments I \u2019 ve made friends express since election day : that they can \u2019 t wait for the next four decades to be over. But quadrennial presidential cycles are a time frame to mark the turn of our lives. Hoping for time to pass swiftly makes our numbers seem small and unworthy. We can \u2019 t let chunks of time determine our fate and gloss over the gift of our very own lives, as if national politics are more important.",
        "Last September, Facebook released a set of colorful images of its proposed new campus in Menlo Park, California. Unlike other college headquarter fortresses, the building is designed to interact with the outside world. There \u2019 s plans for a hotel, a large water park \u2014 which will play host to movie nights and moving trucks \u2014 and a winding railroad overpass which, literally, bridges the gap between city residents and the social media giant.

        "President Barack Obama is planning to live around Washington State for a time after leaving the White House, but that doesn \u2019 t mean he leaves this town. In his last news conference of 2016 on Friday, the current president scolded the media, several conservative outlets, and the country \u2019 s partisan establishment, whom he credited for paving the way for Donald Trump \u2019 s upset victory over Hillary Clinton. The mainstream media may now be busy chasing salacious gossip and the \u2019 s latest tweet, but to undermine the entire press corps undermines the current president \u2019 s cause.",

Barring conviction, the conviction means that Roof, 22, may either spend the rest of his life in prison or be liable to the death penalty.

        "As they go to the polls in a historic presidential race, more than six in 10 Americans believe neither major political party represents their constituents any longer, a survey has predicted. Dissatisfaction with both Democrats and Republicans has grown sharply since 1990, when fewer than half held that Democrats reflected their opinions, due to research by the Public Policy Research Institute ( PRRI ).

        "There are very few issues in Washington that can enthusiastically unite a Republican congressman like Jason Chaffetz and a Democratic one like Elijah Cummings. But this week, one woman has managed to get them both on the same page: Heather Bresch, the CEO of Mylan, maker of the EpiPen, a drug for those who have severe allergies.

The target was reaching the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario\u2019s final four, an aim achieved with victory over Ecuador in the . Does an analysis of the Copa as a whole produce the same feeling of satisfaction? On the pitch it\u2019s been solid entertainment overall.

        "Mike Pence likes to shake his head in disbelief. It\u2019s a nice touch, much like the permanently pained look on his face. But at Tuesday\u2019s debate, it wasn\u2019t entirely clear why Pence was so unhappy. Was he opposed to every word coming out of Tim Kaine\u2019s mouth? Or was he just dismayed at his own situation? It\u2019s not easy campaigning as Donald Trump\u2019s running mate.
