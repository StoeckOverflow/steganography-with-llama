        "The greatest Friday Night Live highlight of them all is the hallowed tradition of the cold shoulder, when the characters only really face the fourth wall when they run : \u201c Live from New York, it \u2019 s Saturday night! \u201d They typically walk backstage \u2014 or in the style of Kate McKinnon \u2019 s Hillary Clinton and Alec Baldwin \u2019 s Donald Trump, \u201c run \u201d four blocks south and back to Times Square to pass people who look like their opponent \u2019 s supporters \u2014 but it \u2019 s different in character. Until Saturday Night, when they ran back in the show as a Rock the Vote advertisement.",
        "As the crowd gathered in New York \u2019 s Union Square Park on Monday night, confused Hillary and Hillary supporters challenged each other for information. \u201c Do you know what we \u2019 re asking for? \u201d asked a man. \u201c Is it going to be some faceless college professor telling us how to vote? \u201d The huge stage being constructed in the shade of the park \u2019 s fountain, and the small detail standing by, continued at more \u2014 and at 7. 30pm, just as the rumours began to rise, we got our answer. The goddess of pop had come to give her support to the Clinton family.",
        "In person, Clint Eastwood recently has the ability to come across as brash and combative ( in an ESPN interview he derided much of California as a \u201c pussy generation \u201d while telling readers to \u201c just fucking get over \u201d Donald Trump \u2019 s many inflammatory remarks ). As a however, the is the antithesis. His latest work \u2014 Letters From Iwo Jima, Million Dollar Baby, Mystic Journey, Unforgiven \u2014 all share an understated quality that makes the emotional impact of his song rings authentic. Eastwood \u2019 s most recent, Sully, squarely fits that category.",
        "When I was eight my parents divorced. Dad passed on, and Mum moved to Germany, so I was looked after and fed by my gran, Alice. She \u2019 d been born in 1899 to Jewish parents who \u2019 d escaped the Russian pogroms. So there were gefilte butter balls and salmon rissoles. My mum hadn \u2019 t been a good cook, but Mum was. I remember being taken down Tooting Street by a babysitting auntie who tried to get me to cook pie and mash with this thing called liquor which was green and rich. I was horrified, but I love those secret places.",
        "A private art gallery in Moscow has reportedly closed down an exhibition of images by US photographer Jock Sturges after a student labelled them child abuse images and a protester threw objects at some of the images. Sunday \u2019 s Day at the Lumiere Brothers Center for Art, a stone \u2019 s throw from the Kremlin, depicts a series of earlier protests by Russian Orthodox priests and nationalists on displays of Christian art. Senator Yelena Mizulina claimed the photo exhibition included images of naked women and therefore qualified as child abuse.",
        "There is no magic used for anxiety. We know this, and yet if we have a propensity for the kind of anxiety that lives within the \u201c disordered \u201d bracket, a cure is exactly what we pray for. At the cost of our discomfort, we are desperate for someone, anything, to take the anxiety away. There are, however, several ways of treating pain by developing strategies for keeping it as part of a highly healthy, productive life. But there cannot be an absolute cure. Why? Because it is something every single human being experiences.",
        "Dear Julia, As another person with bipolar disorder, I really admire the way that you have spoken candidly about your own mental illness and made people around me feel less vulnerable. I hope that over the next phase of my life from my 20s now to my 60s I \u2019 ll be able to adjust to where you are. Right now, though, it \u2019 s simple. I \u2019 m doing the best that I can. I see my family regularly. I \u2019 ve tried certain medications.",
        "Polls normally do quite well to get a dozen respondents, but the poll I \u2019 m looking at about the last presidential debate has drawn a total of 907, 211 responses, 68 % of whom claim that Trump \u201c won \u201d the night. Pretty solid, right? Not so solid \u2014 there are about 907, 211 reasons to dismiss this damn poll as garbage. When polls speak to just a thousand people, they try to make certain those people are a good representation of the entire country.",
        "One of Google \u2019 s cars was involved in one of the worst autonomous driving accident yet, when a vehicle ran a red course and collided with the passenger side door of the modified Lexus SUV. The driver of the vehicle went through a red light as another of Google \u2019 s fleet of modified Lexus SUVs passed through a green light on Friday afternoon. The collision, which occurred at the intersection between El Camino Rea and Phyllis Ave in Valley View, California, caused the Google car \u2019 s airbags to be crushed, and caved in its front and rear tires.",
        "I am a woman in a world with a kind and sweet man whom I love very much. I want to have vaginismus, which made any penetration easier \u2014 this is now cured, but sex is still painful for me. I do not enjoy sex at all and my boyfriend is quite obsessed with me as he doesn \u2019 t like \u201c vanilla sex \u201d. I fantasise about women and romance every morning, but it always stays as a habit. Female notions of intimacy and romance are commonly romantic and mysterious to men.",
        "A woman trying to get a soda can she had dumped into the water in the Everglades had her hand brutally bitten off by an alligator, authorities said. Kimberly Ann Sexton, 49, was attempting to retrieve a Mountain Dew can she took on Friday when the animal bitten her hand, according to a statement released by the Florida parks and wildlife conservation agencies. Sexton was bitten by a 6. 5ft alligator, the report concluded. The animal was found by a trapper and euthanized after the accident.",
        "Russian troops were behind an alleged assassination attempt in Montenegro that included plans to assassinate the prime minister over his government \u2019 s attempt to capture Nato, the country \u2019 s chief international prosecutor has said. Milivoje Katni\u0107 following an investigation concluded that \u201c MPs from Russia \u201d organised a terrorist group, which planned to break into the Montenegrin parliament on election day, kill the prime minister Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107 and bring a coalition to power. About 20 Russian and Montenegrin citizens, including a former commander of Montenegro \u2019 s special police force, were arrested in Montenegro on 16 March.",
        "I get it. Sheryl Crow\u2019s call to shorten our presidential cycle will resonate with just about everyone this year. Who isn\u2019t counting down the days until this is over? Even Hillary Clinton has been winding the months in balls. As Crow points out in a petition on Change. org, which, as of Wednesday, had more than 40, 000 signatures, this extended political circus is a singularly American phenomenon. \u201cThe 2016 election will have lasted nearly 600 days by the time polls close on Nov. 8.",
        "Black patients are about half as likely to be prescribed opioid medicines in the emergency department than white patients, according to a new study. The findings, published on Monday in Plos One, are the latest to show that minorities are treated differently when it comes to pain management. \u201cA black patient with the same level of pain and everything else being accounted for was much less likely to receive an opioid prescription than a white patient with the same characteristics,\u201d said study Astha Singhal, an assistant professor at Boston University\u2019s dental medicine school.",
        "The NBA has moved its annual game from North Carolina because of the state\u2019s \u201ctransgender bathroom law\u201d that limits protections for LGBT people. The league announced on Friday that New Orleans would replace Charlotte as the host city, after lobbying from Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards, a Democrat who has opposed North Carolina\u2019s law. The NBA had already moved the game out of Charlotte, citing the law.",
        "The idea that Russia is meddling in the US elections on behalf of Donald Trump \u2014 fueled by reports that Russians may have hacked and leaked Democratic National Committee emails via WikiLeaks \u2014 has reignited debates about relations. It has also made apparent the American left\u2019s failure to articulate a coherent approach to Russia. No one knows what Trump\u2019s exact relationship with Vladimir Putin or Russian financial interests is \u2014 in part because he refuses to release his tax statements to the public. But Trump isn\u2019t the only one that has an ambiguous relationship with Russia.",
        "Josh Brown will likely not play again for the New York Giants after he was placed on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list. In a letter to the veteran, NFL senior vice president of labor policy Adolpho Birch said Brown was being placed on the league\u2019s \u201cexempt list\u201d while the league investigates whether he should be suspended as punishment for several alleged acts of spousal abuse. Birch said the move \u201cdoes not represent a finding that you have violated the personal conduct policy,\u201d but does pave the way toward potential further sanctions.",
        "Richard Sherman, along with many NFL fans, believes Thursday nights are better suited to pretty much anything other than football. He made his feelings on the subject clear when speaking to reporters about this Thursday\u2019s home game against the LA Rams. \u201c[Thursday Night Football] is a poopfest. It\u2019s terrible,\u201d Sherman said on Tuesday. \u201cWe got home like 1 o\u2019clock in the morning, something like that on Monday and then you\u2019ve got to play again. Congratulations, NFL, you did it again. But they\u2019ve been doing it all season, so I guess we\u2019re the last ones to get the middle finger.",
        "A candlelit vigil has been held outside the ArcLight cinema in Hollywood to coincide with first public screenings of The Birth of a Nation. The film, which opens in the US this weekend, has been overshadowed by the resurfaced allegations of sexual assault against its director, Nate Parker. The group protesting was Fuck Rape Culture, which issued a statement before the protest, explaining its motives.",
        "Technology has been good to . The company has long pioneered new ways of retailing, a number, direct sales via the internet. So when, in 2009, it opened its online store on Facebook the company was expecting another success. Like many others they found Facebook was a tough sell. \u201cWe were one of the first to actually have a Facebook store, and we did have big expectations, but it turned out to be not very successful,\u201d recalled Jon Mandell, of marketing at the flower and gift seller. That, in short, is the story of on Facebook.",
        "The depiction of a Polynesian character in a Disney film has prompted anger across the Pacific islands, with one New Zealand MP saying the portrayal of the god Maui as obese was \u201cnot acceptable\u201d. Jenny Salesa, who is of Tongan heritage, shared a picture on her Facebook account which said Disney\u2019s rendering of Maui in the film Moana resembled a creature that was \u201chalf pig, half hippo\u201d.",
        "Never mind a wet midweek test at Stoke City, this was a Halloween which ended with Swansea City given the lasting fright of a defeat that leaves them second bottom and five points from safety. For Stoke a third consecutive win lifts them to 12th position and suddenly they are looking up following a barren beginning. They made it nine points from nine thanks to a from Alfie Mawson and Wilfried Bony\u2019s second of the match.",
        "The news that the US federal government has refused to issue the permit needed to run a pipeline under the Missouri river means many things \u2014 including that indigenous activists have won a smashing victory, one that shows what nonviolent unity can accomplish. From the start, this has been an battle. Energy Transfer Partners, the company building the pipeline, is as wired as they come: its line of credit links it to virtually every bank you\u2019ve ever heard of.",
        "The dealmakers behind the proposed of ATT and Time Warner have accomplished the impossible: uniting Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders in their condemnation of the deal. Trump, needless to say, has been the most vituperative. The merger would \u201cdestroy democracy\u201d he said. But pretty much everyone in Washington has publicly come out against it. Sanders, Clinton\u2019s opponent for the Democratic nomination and now campaigning on her behalf, is already preparing to battle a future Clinton administration to ensure that regulators turn on the deal. Lining up beside him? Powerhouse senator Elizabeth Warren.",
        "Native Americans protesting against the Dakota Access pipeline (DAPL) on Saturday accused law enforcement officers of cruel and inhumane treatment in jail, but said mass arrests and violent confrontations with police would not deter them from fighting construction of the oil project. Activists were reunited at the Standing Rock camps in North Dakota after their release from local jails. Some told the Guardian police aggressively detained them, crowded them into vans, wrote numbers on their arms to track them, conducted invasive body searches and showed a lack of respect for native culture.",
        "The US election campaign was a bitter battle that left the country divided. While recent figures show 26. 4% of the electorate backed Donald Trump and 26. 5% backed Hillary Clinton (who won the popular vote) 42% of eligible voters didn\u2019t vote at all. The Guardian did a for and received just over 100 responses, with 28% saying they regretted not voting, and 65% saying they didn\u2019t regret it. Others were unsure if they had made a mistake.",
        ", Brazilian prosecutors have charged Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva with being the \u201cmaximum commander\u201d of a vast corruption scheme at the state oil company, Petrobras, in a major blow to the leftist hero\u2019s hopes of a political comeback. This marks the first time Lula, still Brazil\u2019s most popular politician despite corruption accusations against him and his Workers\u2019 party, has been charged by federal prosecutors for his involvement in the massive graft scheme at the oil company. Deltan Dallagnol, a public prosecutor, told a news conference that the Petrobras scheme had caused an estimated 42bn real ($12.",
        "If you take Benjamin Franklin at his word, death is coming. The good and the bad, the young and the old, the : as far as we know, none will live forever. The idea of an eventual death is something that was widely accepted as \u201ctrue\u201d long ago, but, like many things, it must be updated to suit the modern day. It\u2019s time to accept that when death does come for us, it will be at the hand of our smartphone. And isn\u2019t that comforting? To know for sure? Hm?",
        "Our future crops will face threats not only from climate change, but also from the massive expansion of cities, a new study warns. By 2030, it\u2019s estimated that urban areas will triple in size, expanding into cropland and undermining the productivity of agricultural systems that are already stressed by rising populations and climate change. Roughly 60% of the world\u2019s cropland lies on the outskirts of cities \u2014 and that\u2019s particularly worrying, the report authors say, because this peripheral habitat is, on average, also twice as productive as land elsewhere on the globe.",
        "Whatever doubts gnaw at Donald Trump at dead of night, his hardcore supporters will not allow him to give up the dream of the White House. All 18 people interviewed by the Guardian at a Trump campaign rally in the battleground state of Ohio on Thursday night challenged the basic premise that he is losing. If anything, they seemed even more convinced than he is that opinion polls and mainstream media cannot be trusted so he should not throw in the towel."
