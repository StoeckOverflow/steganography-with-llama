In an exclusive interview, Thomas Ross, from Miramar in Miami, told the Guardian that he says he is fighting a goliath. \u201c I am just one kid going up against the resources and power of Apple, the biggest computer in the world.

        "Danny DeVito is scrolling through his YouTube feed, looking at photographs of his own foot. He \u2019 s been sharing them under the hashtag # Trollfoot, which, for the uninitiated, is torn between a performance art museum and a very public private performance : images and videos of the photographer \u2019 s bare trotter held up against a wealth of backdrops, gifted to his following of nearly 4 million. \u201c It \u2019 s kinda cool, \u201d DeVito says, speaking with the viewer over lunch in Manhattan \u2019 s Lower West Side. \u201c There \u2019 s no one, except it \u2019 s me and my foot.",

        "This week, Senator Zuckerberg and his wife Dr Priscilla Johnson pledged $ 3bn to \u201c cure, control and prevent all diseases \u201d by the turn of the century. While $ 3bn sounds like a lot of money, the US National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) spends more than 10 times as much on biomedical research per day. Since 2003, the US has saved more than 20 times as much through the President \u2019 s Emergency Plan for Aids coming to end worldwide.",
        "It is a statement about the issue of white representation in US politics that their \u201c voice \u201d is a real estate developer from Virginia who happened to make a huge appeal for their votes. However, it \u2019 s not enough to appeal to voters the great politicians standing with them. Those who roll their eyes at White \u2019 s ongoing rallies underestimate the extent to which the actually connects with his fellow working class life \u2014 by living the life none of them have always wanted.",
        "In late August, Donald Trump settled down for a town interview with Chris Matthews. The candidate at the interview was still crisscrossing himself on abortion rights \u2014 should Planned Parenthood be defunded? Was Roe v Wade settled law? \u2014 and others made several efforts to pin him down. \u201c If you say abortion is a crime or abortion is illegal, you have to deal with it under law, \u201d Trump said. \u201c Should abortion be illegal?",
        "Out on Route 21 in another state, the long rolling prairies of wheat stretch out on one side of the road, lapping against distant purplish mountain ranges. Abandoned buildings dot the landscape : gaunt skeletons, their souls given up and gone to Washington or Seattle. I even see a lone grey guy, standing and staring at my old car. He must have moved across from Canada, heading south for winter vacation. Some of the towns are no longer thriving, but Pomeroy, in the of the state, shows flashes of hope.",
        "Efforts to combat Aids in general are seriously faltering, with drugs continuing to lose their power, the frequency of infections rising and populations declining, raising the possibility of the epidemic once more spiralling out of control, doctors have warned. The UN has announced a target of 2030 for \u201c the end of Aids \u201d which has been met by donor governments including the US, where the president, Barack Obama, said the goal was in sight last December. But the reality on the ground, especially in the developing world, looks very different.",
        "Every so often \u2014 against all its better instincts \u2014 the film industry turns out a movie that essentially eulogises the act of and asserting its primacy in the modern imagination and fantasy. Correctly, Hollywood tends to police all this nonsense rigorously, and only the examples make it out to the outside world. Though its creators weren \u2019 t actual Hollywood, The Stranger was the last film to completely pull it off, and was rewarded with a couple of Oscars for its troubles.",
        "The Los Angeles Rams have fired manager Jeff Fisher after making five losing seasons leading the franchise. The appointment comes as a surprise because the club had recently announced they had signed him to a extension before this season. But the Rams have been an uninspiring failure in their return to work with a record after Sunday \u2019 s dismal preseason loss to Atlanta during which Fisher was booed by the Coliseum crowd. \u201c He has worked tirelessly despite some challenging days, \u201d Rams owner Ken Kroenke said in a statement released by the team.",
        "Tesla Motors is considering the cause of a fatal crash in China involving two of its vehicles but said that it has \u201c no way of knowing \u201d if its autopilot system was functional at the time of the accident. \u201c Because of the pain caused by the collision, the car was physically incapable of feeding log data to our system, \u201d the company said in a statement on Wednesday.

        "Anthony Weiner \u2019 s latest sexting scandal could easily be worse if it were scripted to maximally embarrass Huma Abedin and her supporters, the Clinton campaign. And on Wednesday, following a New York Post report that showed a photo of Weiner in bed beside his and Abedin \u2019 s young son, Abedin promised that she and her husband would be married.

        "I started competitive skating in 1975, when I was four and a half and growing up in Berlin. It was hard in the beginning, but soon after I started school, things became serious, and my childhood took a back seat as my coach pushed me to excel. I trained seven to eight hours a week. After two years, I was fed \u201c vitamins \u201d by my trainers, all kinds of tests and powders. We had to take them on the ice, in front of everyone.",

        "Reports of the death of the Great Barrier Reef have been greatly exaggerated, scientists have said, after the publication of an \u201cobituary\u201d for the vast coral ecosystem.

        "Of all the hats Georgia congressman John Lewis has worn over his more than 50 years in public life as a protester, activist and representative for Georgia\u2019s fifth district, perhaps none is more unexpected than that of comic book protagonist. But now, nearly eight years after the idea was hatched for the March trilogy \u2014 a graphic novel memoir of Lewis\u2019s experiences in the civil rights movement \u2014 Lewis hopes it will help inspire a new generation to get into what he likes to call \u201cgood trouble\u201d and help young Americans understand how far the nation has come.",
        "There is no plan B. For children like Einas, who spent eight months and his family\u2019s savings journeying from southern Ethiopia to northern France, the dream will die when the Jungle is dismantled. \u201cI am here to reach the UK, that is all I think about, I have no other plan,\u201d said the unaccompanied who arrived in the Calais camp in January.

        "Scientists at the universities of Exeter and York have revealed new details about the menopause in killer whales. Studying orcas in the wild has shown that females live unusually far beyond their fertile years because of the benefits their accumulated knowledge bring to the group, as well as the lifelong support they give their sons. Evolutionary researchers have been quick to draw comparisons between orcas and humans. Could early human societies also have evolved to rely on the invaluable wisdom and help of female elders? These comparisons, though, have been a little too quick for some.",
        "It didn\u2019t end well. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho had his notebook in front of him with the 49 names he had written down to nail \u201cthe lie\u201d that he was averse to bringing through players from academies, the Manchester United way. The names were in green, red and blue and at the end of his press conference he was happy to hand them over.

        "I hate to be an alarmist, but Donald Trump could be on course to be elected president of the United States \u2014 and the decisive moment may well come on Monday night. That\u2019s when he faces Hillary Clinton in what is expected to be one of the most watched events in television history. The TV debates are perhaps the last chance for her to persuade the American people that this man is unqualified for, and unworthy of, the presidency and poses a genuine threat to the republic. If that sounds like panic, then I\u2019m not the only one.",
        "The UK and US have stepped up criticism of the role of Russia and Iran in Aleppo\u2019s humanitarian disaster, amid uncertainty about whether the incoming Trump administration might enter into a deal with Vladimir Putin.

        "The NFL and NBA have roughly the same racial profile with African Americans comprising 68 to 74% of their rosters. They have long been leagues dominated by athletes of color and should be places where essential social issues involving race are discussed.
