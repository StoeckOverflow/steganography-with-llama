        "Ever since Charles Babbage \u2019 s conceptual, unrealised Analytical Universe in the 1830s, computer science has been working very hard to race much of its time. Particularly over the last 75 years, there have been many astounding developments \u2014 the first electronic programmable computer, the first integrated circuit circuit, the first microprocessor. But the next scientific step may be the most interesting of all. Quantum computing is the device that many scientists, engineers and big businesses desire to provide a, well, logical leap into the future.",
        "LeBron James said he has lost respect for Joe Jackson after the famed former coach used the word \u201c posse \u201d to describe the Cleveland organization \u2019 s business partners. Jackson responded harshly referring to Jackson \u2019 s use of the word in a recent interview. Jackson says such comments underscore the courage young have in gaining credibility, especially in the business area. \u201c It had to hurt when [ the Heat ] chose LeBron, \u201d Jackson said in an interview with ESPN published on television. \u201c That was definitely a slap in the face. But there were a lot of little things that came out of that.",
        "Two girls are holding a man down on a couch. One presses her arm against his head, so he can \u2019 t raise it from the floor, while her companion pins his body in place. They are with powerful hands but even so it takes their great strength to keep their body immobilised as one of them cuts through his heart with a gleaming sword. Blood spurts from deep red geysers as she saws. She won \u2019 t stop until his head is fully free. Her victim \u2019 s eyes are wide open. He knows immediately what is happening to him.",
        "Republican nominee Donald Trump made a lot of claims in the Democratic presidential debate on Sunday night. We unfurled some of those statements and take a closer look, issue by issue. \u201c We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police organization, very \u2014 I mean, a large majority of them in the United States. \u201d Trump was endorsed last spring by the Fraternal Order of Police, the country \u2019 s largest union of officers, after eagerly courting the group. He continued with leadership and completed an internal questionnaire about his views, while Hillary Clinton demurred on both counts.",
        "Like upon meeting Nixon, the and Nigel Farage grin, thumbs up, in the gilded vulgarian \u2019 s room of Trump Tower. This statement is a reward as sweet as any the current Ukip leader might have made for \u2014 sweeter, perhaps, than the EU election result itself. It adds bludgeoning value to his claim to be our man in the New Washington, in practice if not by popular appointment. As for Trump : Would there be clearer evidence that the new leader of the free country lacks all sense of decorum and social protocol?",
        "Once the enfant terrible of England, Oliver Stone \u2019 s stature in the industry has gone from illuminating grandmaster to great grandfather with a string of tragic disasters. Alexander, Alexander Street : Money Never Sleeps and Savages are the works of a director depressingly out of sorts and uncomfortable with his landscape, far from the zeitgeisty provocateur he used to be. On paper, the novel of Edward Snowden provides Stone with ample, angry ways to regain his footing and lose faith in his ability to provoke and please.",
        "There \u2019 s a lot going on in Billy Lynn \u2019 s One Halftime Walk, an alternately somber and boisterous film about the effects of combat on America. But despite the great wealth of new psychological, interpersonal and social conflicts that this promises, the complexities are left to those near the camera to unravel. For director Ang Lee, he sees his current project as a way to revolutionize how we view cinema.",

        "When Vincent van Gogh got out of hospital in April 1889, with a white bandage covering the place where his left arm had been, he immediately went back to work in his house next to a cafe in the southern Belgian town of Arles. A still portrait he painted that month seemed like a determined struggle to hold on to the things of this city, to quell his inner turbulence by concentrating on the hard facts of his life. Around a sturdy wooden framework he has laid out a symbolic rendering of the simple pillars of his home.",

        "It must be an incredible feeling to be a Chicago Cubs player today. You walk around town and everyone is talking about you, cheering you, thanking you, loving you, telling you how fantastic you are, naming breakfast cereals after you. They fly white flags with a blue W all over this town, maybe paint them on the backs of trucks or hang them from apartment windows.",
        "The late, great Daniel Patrick Moynihan used to say that everyone was entitled to their own opinion but not to their own set of facts. He obviously never imagined a world according to Donald Trump, whose words are as authentic as his complexion. But don\u2019t take my word for it. Listen to Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s first campaign manager and a CNN analyst, who admitted Thursday that his boss often lies. Speaking at Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics, Lewandowski blamed the media for being gullible enough to believe his own presidential candidate. \u201cThis is the problem with the media.",
        "When Christine Lo left her job in June, she was hoping Obamacare would mean she could still have health insurance. Lo, 35, was confronted by a confusing enrollment process, which she said resulted in persistent calls from insurers trying to lure her in. Although she knew she would face tax penalties if she didn\u2019t get coverage, she chose to cancel doctors\u2019 appointments and go uninsured until she found a new job.",
        "Digital products are weird: they are inert without software to animate them, and software is so technologically and legally weird that it can be very hard to know exactly what you\u2019re buying. But there just might be some clarity on the horizon, thanks to documents I recently filed with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) signed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) several publishers and public interest groups and 20 EFF supporters with important (and alarming!) stories to tell.",
        "Six years after the supreme court opened the floodgates on money in politics with its Citizens United decision, most Americans are well aware how broken our campaign finance system has become. percent of us say there\u2019s too much money in politics, according to a New York Times poll, and two out of three say the wealthy have more influence than everyone else.

        "When Meg was 12, her mother, Annie, found herself unable to look at her. Seeing her daughter made Annie feel unsettled, at times almost angry. At first, she couldn\u2019t figure out why. \u201cAnd then, Meg turned 13 and suddenly, everything slid into place for me,\u201d Annie says. \u201cI found myself thinking, \u2018She\u2019s so tiny.

My parents were in the process of splitting up, and my mother had gone abroad to look after my terminally ill granny \u2014 neither subject was discussed with me.
