        "And now, the end is close. As the world gets twinkly emotional about the Obamas leaving the White House, one fashion question remains. Since 2009, the celebrities have offered up a masterclass in how to look sexy as public figures while simultaneously semaphoring wildly with their clothes. Examples : Michelle in a twisty Christian Siriano gown at this year \u2019 s Democratic Convention or Malia wearing a Smoking Kills at a Philadelphia dinner : statement pieces, in both costumes. Barack Obama \u2019 s Adidas tracksuit, which has disappeared back into the public eye ( it \u2019 s from 2009 ) is part of that family crest.",
        "It boasts picturesque scenery, a temperate climate and a labour shortage in certain areas, but New Zealand \u2019 s most appealing attribute, according to the country \u2019 s leading industrialist, may be that it is \u201c 18, 000km from Boris Johnson \u201d. More than 10, 500 Britons have inquired about emigrating to the country following the Brexit vote, the New Zealand Herald has revealed, more than doubling the number of the same period every year. In the 49 days preceding Britain \u2019 s vote to join the EU, 10, 647 people from the area registered with Immigration New Zealand, compared with 4, 599 in 2015.",
        "Maria Sharapova, the leading athlete in the history of women \u2019 s sport, has been banned for six years for failing a positive test during the Australian Championships in January, leaving her illustrious tennis career hanging in the sand. The Russian \u2014 who had been provisionally selected to compete at the Rio Olympics in August \u2014 intends to appeal against the decision. But in the likelihood that the ban remains in place, her prospects of achieving the standards that won her five grand slam titles will be much diminished by such a long stay.",
        "Over the 11 years that Elisabeth Merkel has been at the top of German leadership, steering her country through successive financial crashes, huge debt crises and the aftershocks of wars in the Middle East, she has been able to rely on one constant : the unity of her party. If Merkel \u2019 s reign has looked so solid, it has partly been because the Christian Democrat leader hasn \u2019 t had to shake off challenges from within her own party. But one year on from the end of Europe \u2019 s refugee crisis, that situation is changing.",
        "Megan Fox has spoken about her wish to stay away from acting to help expose the planet \u2019 s \u201c deep mysteries \u201d. The actor, who stars in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles : Out of the Ashes, believes that performing isn \u2019 t her \u201c personal passion \u201d and instead chooses to explore other avenues. \u201c I have other skill sets and gifts that are much, much stronger that I am obligated to exercise and teach, \u201d she told the LA Weekly. \u201c I \u2019 m really more intellectually minded. I \u2019 ve also been into alternative history, antiquities, books.",
        "Cambodian workers have filed a lawsuit against two companies that supply Vietnamese supermarkets, claiming they were trafficked to work under pressure in a Thai seafood factory that migrated to the US. The civil complaint, filed in June in a California federal court, accuses the US and Thai firms of knowingly profiting from the harsh \u2019 working conditions and violating the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, a national law aimed at preventing human trafficking. Last week, the firms filed a motion to dismiss the suit on jurisdictional grounds.",
        "Humanity \u2019 s impact on the planet is now so profound that a new geologic epoch \u2014 the Anthropocene \u2014 needs to be declared, according to an official expert group who presented the recommendation to the National Geological Congress in Cape Town on Monday.",
        "Perhaps we should be naming it \u201c The Curse of Sandman \u201d. Another director who was on board to work on the movie adaptation of the Neil Simon book appears to have hit ship. Eric Heisserer, whose credits include the movie remakes of 80s horror staples Nightmare on Elm Street and The Thing, was called back in March by New Line as the latest choice for its troubled project to return the comics series to the big screen. Heisserer was brought in just after Joel and actor Joseph finished the movie, citing financial differences with Warner subsidiary New Line.",
        "Given that the idea of trying to absorb goals had not worked for any of Manchester City \u2019 s opponents, it made sense for Swansea to try another different last week, as the Welsh side intended to disrupt the league leaders \u2019 momentum by squeezing their when they had the advantage. It did not work, of course, because Swansea were still too sharp in form. Yet Tottenham Hotspur \u2019 s feverish printing press could find greater rewards at White Hart Lane on Saturdays.",
        "In his acting heyday, Clint Eastwood was a taciturn maestro of understatement. In his Man With No Name or Dirty Harry days, one eyebrow lift was usually enough to send even the most arrogant hero into throes of panic and while a simple flick of the lip usually signified that the average dude was a dead person walking. So it comes as no surprise to learn that Eastwood \u2019 s unusual directing style made Tom Hanks extremely effective on the set of the disaster film Sully.",
        "\u201c I was an opponent of the Iraq war from the beginning \u2026 I also publicly expressed my deepest doubts about the invasion. Five months before the invasion I expressed, in an interview with Neil Cavuto, to whom I sent my best wishes for a speedy invasion, that \u2018 perhaps [ we ] shouldn \u2019 t be doing it yet \u2019 and that \u2018 the war is a much bigger victory \u2019. \u201d \u2014 15 August, Youngstown, Ohio, Among the many past speeches Trump has lied about prior to the Iraq war \u201c from the presidential \u201d in Youngstown he tried to provide cover.",
        "An unarmed police man killed by a stolen Oklahoma police car can be seen on video driving away from officers and leaving his SUV with his hands up before he enters the driver \u2019 s side door, where he drops to the ground after being struck with a stun gun and then fatally shot. In addition, the police helicopter video was among several films released on Monday showing the shooting of Terence Crutcher and its crew. A man in the helicopter that rises above the scene as Crutcher walks to the scene can be heard saying : \u201c Going for a Taser.",
        "The residents of North east Aleppo have seen another day of hope and fear as a truce and security agreement hung by a chain, with negotiators racing to rescue a village that could save tens of thousands of lives. About 8, 000 people had been evacuated from the shrinking patch of Syrian territory but tens of thousands more were still trapped when the government of the Syrian president, Bashar signed the pact, which was negotiated by Syria and Russia.",
        "Three weeks ago, around a quarter of the American population elected a demagogue with no prior experience in public service to the presidency. In the eyes of many of his supporters, this lack of preparation was not a liability, but a strength. Donald Trump had run as a candidate whose primary qualification was that he was not \u201ca politician\u201d. Depicting yourself as a \u201cmaverick\u201d or an \u201coutsider\u201d crusading against a corrupt Washington establishment is the oldest trick in American politics \u2014 but Trump took things further.",
        "After months of controversy including a turf war and a petition to block it from happening, the Panorama music festival will finally debut in this weekend. Its entrance into the New York festival scene parks its tanks firmly on the lawn of the more established festival Governor\u2019s Ball, which takes place on Randalls Island each June. The prospect of a new festival entering the city caused such a stir that Governor\u2019s Ball organizers started a petition to ask Mayor Bill de Blasio to deny a permit on Panorama\u2019s original location: Flushing Meadows Park in Queens.",
        "Lamar Jackson was trying to remember the last time he cried. He was pretty sure it involved losing a little league football game. On Saturday, the quarterback became the first Louisville player to win the Heisman Trophy, beating out preseason favorite Deshaun Watson of Clemson despite some struggles. Watson, who finished third last season, was a distant second. Baker Mayfield finished third and Oklahoma and fellow finalist Dede Westbrook was fourth. Michigan\u2019s Jabrill Peppers was fifth.",
        "We thought we were clear: 2016 was surely going to call a truce for Christmas. And be it by phone, Facebook or some other means another pretty illusion was shattered as the news came through. George Michael is gone. Quickly the personal associations crowded my mind: the names of friends this needed to be shared with were easy (some would say obvious) to summon.",
        "Draymond Green\u2019s to the Olympics remains less than ideal. On Sunday the Golden State Warriors star, who will be representing the US at the Rio Games, was forced to apologize after he posted a picture of his penis on social media. He told reporters that he had pressed the wrong button on Snapchat, posting the photo in error, and said the image had meant to be \u201cprivate\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re all one click away from placing something in the wrong place,\u201d Green said. \u201cI suffered from that this morning. \u201d He had initially claimed his account had been hacked.",
        "Did Hillary Clinton lose the election because she is a woman? The answer is no, but the reasons behind that \u201cno\u201d are complicated. It\u2019s certainly impossible to dismiss the presence of extreme sexism in the campaign: the media narrative of a battle between a highly qualified woman and a \u201c \u201d man. Donald Trump demonstrated over and over again that he loathes powerful women who do not bend to his will, and so did many of his supporters. Much of his criticism of Clinton \u2014 often through taunting and bullying \u2014 had strong sexist undertones.",
        "Facebook has deleted a post by the Norwegian prime minister in an escalating row over the website\u2019s decision to remove content featuring the winning \u201cnapalm girl\u201d photograph from the Vietnam war. Erna Solberg, the Conservative prime minister, called on Facebook to \u201creview its editing policy\u201d after it deleted her post voicing support for a Norwegian newspaper that had fallen foul of the social media giant\u2019s guidelines.",
        "The new DC Comics supervillain movie certainly brings the crazy with its team of psychopathic a Dirty Hannibal Lecters. It also brings the chaos and the surreal disorientation. It\u2019s undoubtedly an advance on that recent uneasy Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. But does it bring the funny?",
        "Ohio governor John Kasich has vetoed the controversial \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d which aimed to ban abortions from as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, while also signing into law a separate and restrictive abortion ban. The heartbeat bill, passed seemingly out of nowhere by the Ohio senate last week, would have been the most restrictive abortion law in the country.",
        "The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, has stepped up the pressure on the UK over its timetable to leave the EU, insisting that Brexit cannot be cancelled or delayed, and that Britain will have to live with the consequences. His hardline comments came after a meeting with David Cameron in northern France at the Battle of the Somme centenary commemorations. \u201cThe decision has been taken it cannot be delayed and it cannot be cancelled. Now [the British] have to face the consequences,\u201d Hollande told reporters. \u201cBeing in the European Union has advantages.",
        "The death of Islamic State\u2019s chief propagandist, Abu Muhammad has removed the group\u2019s most valuable figure in its war against the west, but his demise does not mean an end to the carnage. Over the past two years, Adnani has set in motion a phase of the terror group\u2019s growth that will continue to give it lead billing among the threats to Europe and the US. The people he empowered and the structures he put in place mean the menace of Isis will continue without him.",
        "In the weeks since one of the most divisive and momentous elections in living memory, the news has itself become the news. Consider what has been the hottest media talking point: the question of fake news. On the 4 December, a man was arrested in Washington DC after firing a gun in a pizza restaurant. This has been linked to \u201cPizzagate\u201d the bizarre conspiracy theory that holds that there is a subterranean child abuse conspiracy involving in the Democratic party, a set of code words and a string of pizza parlours. . Cannibalism. Handkerchief. Satanism.",
        "Of all the children stuck in the Calais camp, Jawaad (not his real name) was one of the best able to articulate the horror of his situation, living in a tent for months, with no adult to care for him. I met him in August and was impressed by his elegant English, which he had learned from his father, a Nato translator who was targeted by the Taliban for working with western forces, and who had been forced to flee the country separately. Jawaad had no idea where his father was, and had travelled from Afghanistan to France alone.",
        "The engine of capitalism is struggling to create the abundance that was once taken for granted. The basic hope that parents have for their children \u2014 that their lives will be better than their own \u2014 is being lost. For many, life isn\u2019t just not getting better. It\u2019s getting worse. A recent study showed that only about half of workers in America earn more than their parents did at the same age. Compare that to previous generations. In 1940, 92% of Americans in their 30s earned more than their parents did at the same age. That\u2019s a vast drop.",
        "There will be few fans inside Mexico City\u2019s monstrous Estadio Azteca when the Oakland Raiders face the Houston Texans on Monday night. Mexicans on a salary would have to work for over nine days to afford the cheapest tickets, while the most expensively priced seats equate to 98 days of labour. Renovated to meet the NFL\u2019s needs, Mexico\u2019s most famous stadium has had its capacity permanently reduced from 104, 000 to 87, 000 to make way for more lucrative VIP suites, new locker rooms and a larger press box.",
        "Ava DuVernay is tired of successful black films being labeled as flukes. Speaking about Straight Outta Compton while at the Los Angeles film festival the director said the drama\u2019s success didn\u2019t catch her by surprise. The film went on to earn $161m from a $28m budget. \u201cBut I remember [at the time] a CNN headline saying: Compton film debuts with no shootings,\u201d the director of 2014\u2019s Selma recalled. DuVernay acknowledged while Straight Outta Compton pushed \u201ca national moment forward\u201d she added \u201cit\u2019s not like it\u2019s not happened before. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really just a selective amnesia,\u201d she said.",
        "Welcome, then, to the Future (Arena) for a glimpse into the direction global sport is heading. A complex brew of politics, globalisation, sport and money has been distilled and poured into a hastily built and brightly coloured bowl. A Qatar handball team constructed at great expense by importing players from around the world as part of the Gulf state\u2019s ambitious vault on to the world sporting stage is playing a French outfit that are aiming for their third Olympic gold in a row."
