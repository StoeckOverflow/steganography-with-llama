When the Nazis entered the Second World War, audiences can flatter themselves that they would never have collaborated with Robert Montgomery \u2019 s Fatherland or Amazon \u2019 s Man in the Ice Castle.

A heat haze shimmered over the road ahead, shrouding first an abandoned army barracks, then ransacked, smouldering factories, an empty crossroads, and finally, the city itself.
