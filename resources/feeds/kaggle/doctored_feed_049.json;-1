        "Guy Pearce is nearing a deal to direct Ritchie \u2019 s upcoming adaptation of the company \u2019 s 1992 animated classic Aladdin. Darren Lin, who produced the film Sherlock Holmes adaptation starring Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law, offers an \u201c ambitious and \u201d take on Aladdin, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Little Fish writer Brian August has written the book, which is said to include many of the musical elements from the series, but is in its structure \u2014 much like Ritchie \u2019 s two preceding successes, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch.",
        "Perhaps the most daunting question for Manchester City \u2019 s fans is that these are still the embryonic stages of Pep Guardiola \u2019 s reign, with the players slowly getting used to a new mix of ideas, different teams and a manager who gives the illusion he is satisfied only by the highest level of excellence. Five games, five wins \u2014 Guardiola has had an immaculate campaign, even if the latest is tarnished by the crushing loss of Sergio Ag\u00fcero to Middlesbrough.",
        "As best I can explain, the use of overt female models to market products \u2014 from classical music to ice cream bars to cars to sports and beyond \u2014 has three parts : it encourages men and women buy crap they don \u2019 t need it makes too many guys think that being sexy ( and its another necessary component, \u201c sexual \u201d ) is an important life force and it convinces men that the community at large really, truly cares about their boners.",
        "The planet is cooling at a pace not experienced within the past 1, 000 years, at best, making it \u201c very unlikely \u201d that the planet will stay within a normal temperature limit approved by nations just last month, according to Nasa \u2019 s top research scientist. This year has also seen scorching heat throughout the world, with the average winter temperature peaking at 1. 38C above levels experienced in the 19th century, perilously close to the 1. 5C limit agreed in the landmark Paris climate conference.",
        "Things are calming down at the Dakota Access Pipeline protest near Cannon County, North Dakota, as darkness falls. It \u2019 s been an eventful day. 117 men have been arrested at the Standing Stone camp, a spokesperson for the Mitchell County sheriff \u2019 s office says. \u201c Currently law enforcement is engaged in a shootout at the backwater bridge, just north of the shooting camp. Protester have lit a fire near the bridge, \u201d the spokesman said in a statement. 117 individuals have been arrested. Morton County will be utilizing other jails in this mass capture operation.",
        "Lil Wayne has distanced himself from the Black Lives Matter movement, saying : \u201c I don \u2019 t feel connected to a damn gang that ain \u2019 t got nothin \u2019 to do with me. If you do, you crazy as hell \u2026 Feeling connected to someone that ain \u2019 t got nothin \u2019 to do with you? If it ain \u2019 t got nothin \u2019 to do with me, I ain \u2019 t tied to it. \u201d The rapper was interviewed on HBO \u2019 s Nightline on US television on Thursday night, and said he felt instances of police brutality against black people should not be regarded as a collective phenomemon.",
        "Rupert Murdoch has named company directors Jack Abernethy and Bill Shine as to lead Fox Communications after chief executive officer Roger Ailes resigned last month following sexual harassment allegations. Abernethy is senior executive of Fox Radio Stations and Shine is also executive vice president at Fox, a unit of Network Fox. Both men began at Fox when it launched in 1996. They will go to Murdoch, who has been running the remainder of the cable network on an interim basis. The appointments are due immediately, Fox confirmed.",
        "The words, when they surfaced, had lost no power over a month of or almost a decade of speech. \u201c So it is with humility, determination and boundless confidence in America \u2019 s promise that I accept your offer for president of the United States, \u201d said Hillary Clinton \u2014 the first American to step on the brink of being called madame president. There were no gimmicks. No more stories of breaking glass. Just a beautiful face in a trademark white suit, standing in a very awkward spot.",
        "Kerry Bish\u00e9 has a point. More to the point, she has a problem with a character. \u201c Can we change this? Can I say narcissist type of diva? \u201d she asks Halt and Catch Fire showrunner Chris Rogers and the producer of the episode, Reed Morano. It \u2019 s not a big exchange for a series that has gained a reputation for putting together some of the most female characters on show. Bish\u00e9 \u2019 s character, Donna Reed, is in the process of disparaging her partner, Michael Howe, played by Jeff Davis, in the tech Mutiny.",
        "Despite the large list of proposals in her recent economic speech list, it is what Hillary Clinton did not support that is most interesting. She received praise for unleashing the green jobs reform, immigration reform, expanded social security, reducing family leave and expanding childcare. This is all great stuff, the hundreds of years of progressive politics. But what struck me most was what was left on the living room floor. Clinton promised to oppose the legislation before and after the election. But she studiously avoided getting a vote in the December \u201c \u201d debate, as advocates have encouraged.",
        "I had been living on the main island of Maui for about a year, starting as a dive instructor, when everybody from the mainland US decided to visit last year : Renee and her boyfriend Chris, Noah, Sarah and Josh, all keen to have some adventures. We spent a week exploring another island, but there was a spot close to home I wanted to take them \u2014 a serene waterfall with a beautiful bathing pool beneath it. I \u2019 d been once before and knew it would be a perfect spot to spend the day.",

Year round the patches of mixed produce fill a small portion of the McGrath family farm in Camarillo, which includes sprawling stands of berries, tomatoes and other organic produce. Javier Carranza is an expert when it comes to chopping and trimming vegetation with a hand scythe between the two rows.

        "In the beginning, Donald Trump simply wouldn\u2019t allow the press to eat cold meats from the buffet. Trump was holding a house party in suburban New Hampshire in late June 2015. The main event was around a backyard swimming pool under a fickle summer sky. The family hosting the presidential candidate had a son who was a Trump superfan. He had somehow coaxed the candidate to appear at the backyard event. Before the speech, there would be a reception for invited guests with hors d\u2019oeuvres stacked on the family\u2019s dining room table. But this was for invited guests only.",
        "How does one make an a strapping adventure about colonial pursuits without either coming across as an imperialist or going overboard with \u201cvirtue signaling\u201d? Earlier this year Colombian director Ciro Guerra released one of the best films of the year, Embrace of the Serpent, which told a tale of early 20th century European explorers in the Amazon, from their guide\u2019s point of view.",
        ", It was a photo seen around the world: Mbuyisa Makhubu, his face twisted with anguish, carrying Hector Pieterson in his arms after the child was fatally shot by South Africa\u2019s police. Thousands of black children and teenagers had taken to the streets of Soweto in June 1976 to protest at being forced to study in Afrikaans. Police responded to the peaceful protest with force, spraying bullets at the schoolchildren. The images ricocheted around the world, helping to galvanise the international community against the brutality of the apartheid regime.",
        "Alicia Machado became an American citizen just in time to vote against Donald Trump. It\u2019s a vote that has been a long time coming. In May 1996, the Venezuelan beauty queen was just 19 years old when she was crowned the winner of the Miss Universe pageant, which had recently been bought by the Manhattan business mogul. That year should have been one of sheer happiness and possibility for Machado, and for a moment it was.",
        "Bernie Sanders on Sunday defended Hillary Clinton over recorded remarks that Republicans said demeaned his supporters but which he said were entirely in line with his beliefs. The recording, from a 16 February fundraiser, was acquired by hackers and first published by the Washington Free Beacon this week. In it, Clinton said she feared for young people such as those who supported Sanders in the Democratic primary. \u201cYoung people seem to be listening to promises on both sides,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cand I\u2019m worried that you can\u2019t get from here to there without going incrementally.",
        "Senate Republicans staged an unprecedented blockade of Barack Obama\u2019s nomination to fill the US supreme court seat left vacant by the unexpected death of Justice Antonin Scalia. This gamble could have failed, allowing Hillary Clinton to nominate a younger and more liberal justice than Merrick Garland. Instead, from their perspective, it was a huge success. Republicans will now maintain control of the court. And depending on how many nominations Donald Trump gets, very rightwing Republican justices could be in control of the supreme court for more than a generation.",
        "The panic and terror on Maria Schneider\u2019s face in the infamous \u201cget the butter\u201d scene in Last Tango in Paris, in which she is depicted being anally raped by Marlon Brando, is absolutely real, even if the rape is not. Those big cinematic heaves are not acting. \u201cI was crying real tears,\u201d Schneider once said. She was being humiliated in real life and on screen and she knew it. For years, she made public what happened during the making of that 1972 movie.",
        "Czech police have arrested a Russian hacker suspected of in the United States, officials said on Wednesday. Police said an international warrant for the man, who was not named, was issued by Interpol and that officers cooperated with the FBI on the case. A police spokesman, Jozef Bocan, said the man was arrested in a Prague hotel. After the arrest the suspect collapsed, received first aid treatment and was hospitalized, Bocan said.

        "Simone Biles\u2019 bid for a fifth Olympic gold medal fell short as she had to settle for bronze in the individual balance beam competition. Sanne Wevers of the Netherlands captured gold with a highly artistic routine, while the American upstart Laurie Hernandez capped off her Olympic debut with the silver. The beam, which dares gymnasts to perform routines of extraordinary rigour on a platform 4ft above the ground and not much wider than a credit card, is the sport\u2019s most precarious apparatus and the world champion of the past two years fell victim to the discipline\u2019s essential unpredictability.",
        "Donald Trump entered a bitter war of words with Senator Jeff Flake on Sunday as the Republican nominee reverted to his behavior in the primary where he constantly attacked elected GOP officials. Trump used Twitter to attack Flake, a senator from Arizona who has yet to commit to supporting Trump in November, as \u201cvery weak and ineffective\u201d on the issue of immigration. Trump also tweeted: \u201cThe Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people such as @JeffFlake, if it is going to stop illegal immigration,\u201d after Flake criticized Trump in an interview Sunday with CBS\u2019s John Dickerson.",
        "One of the most sophisticated murder investigations in Italian history concluded on Friday with the key suspect jailed for life after being caught through a combination of DNA evidence and the revelation of family secrets.

        "Some travel to see the sights, others travel to relax, but Steven Seagal has a bigger mission: world peace. Or so he says. The Hollywood actor, who in recent months has been given the treatment by various leaders, said on a visit to Kyrgyzstan he wanted \u201cto bring all people together, to live in harmony\u201d. Last month, Seagal met with Alexander Lukashenko, president of Belarus and regarded as \u201cEurope\u2019s last dictator\u201d.

        "The University of Wisconsin says it asked a fan wearing a Barack Obama mask and a noose around his neck to remove the offensive parts of the costume during the school\u2019s football game on Saturday night against Nebraska. A picture circulating on social media showed the fan in a jumpsuit, wearing the mask, the noose and a sign on his chest. Another person appeared to be holding up the rope of the noose. The fan complied when guest services staff asked to remove the offensive parts of the costume, according to a school statement.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to say whether he would accept the outcome of next month\u2019s US presidential election if he were to lose is unprecedented and chilling, legal experts have said. But although the failure by a major party nominee to concede defeat on election night would throw American democracy into uncharted territory, from a legal standpoint, it would hardly make a difference, experts from across the political spectrum said. \u201cFrankly, under our system, it is irrelevant whether the loser concedes or not,\u201d said James Bopp, the conservative constitutional lawyer. \u201cThe vote of the electoral college is conclusive.",

        "It is not often that Usain Bolt is upstaged but on a balmy night in London the fastest man in the world played second fiddle to Laura Muir, a veterinary science student from the University of Glasgow, and Kendra Harrison, a hurdler from Tennessee. The Harrison produced the performance of the evening, obliterating a field and the Bulgarian Yordanka Donkova\u2019s 100m hurdles world record which had stood for 28 years.

Police who arrived at the scene found shell casings and blood throughout the restaurant, located west of downtown Los Angeles. Two possible suspects were being questioned.
