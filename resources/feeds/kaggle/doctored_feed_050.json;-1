        "It is a curiously grotesque thing. While a tightly packed group all took selfies with the Democratic Party \u2019 s US presidential campaign, a sly photographer strolled around the side. The whole view is unflattering \u2014 not only to Hillary Rodham Clinton but the crowd. They all have their backs pressed to her while they hold up phones to take pictures of \u2026 themselves, with the HRC in the background. No one seems to want a photograph just of the candidate. It \u2019 s a selfie or nothing.",
        "The tiny town of Tackley, eight miles southeast of Oxford, has probably not nurtured too many elite sportspeople, but it was in the English countryside that Christian Pulisic caught the football bug for good. \u201c It was only one year, but it you look back it was what propelled him into playing the violin, \u201d says Mark Pulisic of a friendship that came about when his wife, Ruth, received a Fulbright scholarship to travel abroad on a teaching trip.",
        "The United Kingdom Ban has said he believed genocide could continue in South Sudan unless immediate action is taken, renewing his plea for the security ministry to impose an arms embargo on the country. \u201c If we fail to act, South Sudan will be on a trajectory toward mass atrocities, \u201d Ban told the security council. Noting that the UN \u2019 s special officer on the prevention of genocide, Adama Dieng, has viewed genocide as a process, Ban said : \u201c I am afraid that genocide is about to begin unless immediate action is taken.",
        "Am I too old for this birth? Too young for this pregnancy? What about my arms, my face, my shoes \u2014 am I the right age for those too? Women ask themselves these questions because society categorizes things according to age. Categories which overdetermine human experience, unfortunately, continue to mess with one \u2019 s head. Jessica Winter \u2019 s fifth novel, Break in Time of Emergency, addresses itself mainly to the problem of having to live up to one \u2019 s age while female. Her mother, Jen, is thirtysomething, so her categorical problems extend to reproduction, friendship, marriage and work.",
        "On just about any given day over the past year or so, it has been tempting to scream at the idiocy of Tyson Chandler \u2019 s indiscretions and say : \u201c Right, mush, you \u2019 ve come too far this time. \u201d But his generous contribution to the cause of global peace and understanding has alienated him to the point where even his most loyal fans must be wondering how much lower he can go.",
        "The Republican party, its leaders like to say, is a party of ideas. Debates over budgets and education programmes are important, but they must be conducted with an eye on the major questions \u2014 questions about the future of the state, the future of politics and the meaning of virtue. These questions provide the foundation for a growing intellectual establishment \u2014 thinktanks such as the American Enterprise Institute, blogs such as National Review, pundits such as Barry Will and Bill Kristol \u2014 dedicated to advancing the right \u2019 s agenda.",
        "We \u2019 re in the era where a nation \u2019 s legacy extends even after they leave the White House. Jimmy Carter, now in his 90s, and his sister, Rosalynn have helped build more than 4, 000 buildings for Habitat for Humanity since he was ingloriously forced into voluntary retirement three years ago. In 2010, at the request of Barack Obama, former President Bill Clinton and George W Bush stood party aside and team up to help rebuild Haiti after our island neighbor was rocked by an earthquake.",
        "Adam Thielen threw a touchdown pass to start Minnesota \u2019 s opening touchdown and finished with a 127 yards, and the Minnesota defense flustered Brock Osweiler and the Dallas Texans on their way to a championship on Sunday. Marcus Sherels returned a punt 79 yards for a touchdown and Cordarelle Patterson scored on another sharp throw by Josh Bradford, who produced another game and deftly guided the Colts ( ) into their bye week.",
        "From Marcia Ryan to Mary Epps to Bette and Dot Tattler, Jennifer Paulson has played a range of supporting characters in stories with far more complicated plots. By contrast, her role in this week \u2019 s drama Blue Jay is gone. The film, which is shot in black and white and takes place over one afternoon, follows the story of two high school sweethearts ( Amanda and Laura ) who reconnect after running into each other at the supermarket. The two spend the afternoon together and suddenly, things aren \u2019 t so good any more.",
        "Just as the Rio races finish, the European Space Agency find their new triple jump target, the Philae space probe. The Philae attracted the world \u2019 s attention on 12 July 2014, when it landed on comet. No one \u2014 myself included \u2014 who was at the European Earth Operations Centre ( ESOC ) in Darmstadt, Germany, for the landing could feel the sweep of emotions that this giant robotic envoy generated. Partly because not everything went according to plan. But the hiccups only endeared the lander to the general public at least.",
        "Lauri Love, the man accused of hacking into the computer servers of the US missile intelligence agency, Nasa and the Federal government, has lost his appeal against extradition to Canada. Judge Nina Tempia said the who has Asperger syndrome, could be treated for by \u201c medical facilities in the United States prison estate \u201d and implied that he should answer the \u201c extremely serious charges \u201d in the courts where the damage was inflicted. Saturday, who lives with his parents in Hampton, Suffolk, was granted permission to appeal against Friday \u2019 s decision and given bail pending further legal action.",
        "This year \u2019 s best award for best French language film goes to Hungary \u2019 s daring comedy drama Son of Man, the universally lauded yet undeniably hard to watch debut from newcomer L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nemes. Next year, it \u2019 s announced a newcomer will once again take part. On Monday, France faces the somewhat surprising time to place its Oscar bets in the hands of the master provocateur Paul Verhoeven, an auteur renowned for populist fare. The whose fare includes Showgirls and Basic Instinct, has effectively made it his mission to pander to the mainstream.",
        "The final day of South Park \u2019 s serialized 20th novel picked up where we left off next week : in the midst of an Internet crisis caused by scores of trolls ( of both the presidential and ). In the Pentagon, the \u201c stank face \u201d and President Garrison is furious that the Russians are scrambling bombers to reach Denmark in retaliation for Troll Trace, the program that will allow readers to look up anyone else \u2019 s internet history that will go online in minutes. But, it seems there \u2019 s still hope!",
        "I was feeling a bit gloomy the other week, thanks to heavy rain and the big shadow cast by all the in government. But then I came across Molly O\u2019Neill\u2019s A Appetite (Penguin, 1997) and cheered up no end. As the title suggests, the book is pegged around the joy of eating the right food in the relevant season. \u201cWhen the air grows heavy and the human spirit wilts,\u201d O\u2019Neill writes (be that due to actual summertime humidity or a metaphorical political cloud) \u201ca salad is the best revenge.",
        "For those of us whose school memories include struggling with long division and quadratic equations, it may be surprising to learn that there was a time when almost all mathematics was recreational. In the medieval world, for example, the role of maths was mostly as an intellectual diversion. (Apart from its use for technical, tasks like measuring land area or calculating tax.) When, in 799, the British scholar Alcuin of York sent a letter containing 50 or so maths problems to Charlemagne, he did so not to infuriate the king but to amuse him.",
        "The persistently hilarious new female Ghostbusters film has been released into a perfect storm of media nonsense. An admittedly unfunny trailer. An even unfunnier tendency to review trailers and consider them important or interesting standalone events. An ugly Gamergate mob of male online commenters, and the lamestream media\u2019s need to reward and amplify their abuse. And why was the Ghostbusters trailer so ropey when the film itself fires off a zinger every 10 seconds or so \u2014 except for the lengthy action scenes? Maybe to save the best material for the film itself.",
        "I was born just months before women got the vote in America, in 1920. I\u2019m 96 years old now. On Tuesday I was so excited to vote for Hillary Clinton. Just the idea that a woman was running for the highest position in the land overwhelmed me. When I cast my vote I had a good feeling about it \u2014 a very, very good feeling. I felt that my voice was being heard, and that I was finally able to vote for one of us. Yesterday I went to bed feeling really hopeful.",
        "Donald Trump would play into the hands of the Islamic State militant group, Barack Obama claimed, in one of his strongest attacks on Donald Trump\u2019s preparedness to be president. Following an meeting of his National Security Council at the Pentagon on Thursday, the US president said Trump\u2019s rhetorical attacks on Muslims worldwide, his enthusiasm for \u201cbomb[ing] the shit\u201d out of Isis and his proposed ban on Muslim immigration would \u201cbackfire\u201d. Without using Trump\u2019s name, Obama said that only \u201cbad decisions\u201d made by the US would prevent a defeat of Isis that he portrayed as inevitable.",
        "\u201cIt was so much fun,\u201d John Oliver writes in an email. \u201cIt was basically an hour of laughing at Andy every week. \u201d Oliver is talking about The Bugle, the clever, biting, and audio newspaper that Oliver and Andy Zaltzman created back in 2007. The Bugle started out at the Times in London with weekly doses of what they called \u201csatire and bullshit\u201d with Oliver and Zaltzman cracking each other up with a steady string of puns from Zaltzman and hysterical outrage from Oliver.",
        "This time was nothing like 2012. But nothing would ever be like 2012. For on that July day in London when Kayla Harrison went from unknown to American judo sensation, everything exploded inside her: the sexual abuse from of a previous coach, the years of fighting to prove herself strong and the realization that she was the first US woman to win a judo gold. She ran. She jumped. She screamed. She cried. Rare has been the Olympian who celebrated the way Kayla Harrison celebrated when she got her first gold medal.",
        "The five men were always going to stand out in the isolated New Zealand surfing village of Ahipara. Their inept attempts to launch a boat with multiple mechanical problems provided one clue. The fact they were also offering locals large amounts of cash for help was another. \u201cI knew something dodgy was up,\u201d says Peter Furze, a surfer who watched the men try and fail to get their boat into the rough seas off Ninety Mile Beach.",
        "The election approaches the nation seethes the hatred festers the dead start to talk. Old intolerances have come roaring back as the United States finally reaches the end of the most virulent, vacuous presidential contest in living memory. For African Americans, particularly, the catastrophe of Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy has appeared almost as a punishment for the election of the first black president, and the overt, unashamed racism of his campaign, leavened with promises of violence, has affirmed that American history does not have an inbuilt happy ending.",
        "It\u2019s been a busy week for the US labor secretary, Tom Perez. On Tuesday night, the White House announced that the Obama administration had finalized a new rule that could potentially expand overtime benefits to 4. 2 million more Americans. On Wednesday morning, Perez boarded Air Force Two and with Joe Biden and flew to Columbus, Ohio, where they made the official public announcement inside Jeni\u2019s Splendid Ice Creams. The new rule has been described by some as second only to the Affordable Care Act in its ability to affect the wellbeing of and Americans.",
        "Iceland is to allow parents to name their daughters Angel\u00edna \u2014 a name that, like many others, has been prohibited until now as part of efforts to preserve linguistic cohesion. Iceland has a limited list of authorised given names managed by the official Personal Names Committee, which regularly adds names to the list at parents\u2019 request. On Wednesday the committee added Angel\u00edna and 10 other names to the list, including Luna, Hofdis and Eilif for girls and Eyjar and Kiran for boys.",
        "The 2016 campaign has not been kind to Melania Trump, and this week is no exception. In two new interviews, she was sent in to defend her husband\u2019s alleged mistreatment of women despite not knowing him when most of the accusers did. And she did so in front of a media that has not treated her kindly, to say the least, throughout Donald Trump\u2019s run for president. Poised under pressure, Melania did as good a job as her husband could have hoped, and a better job than he has of staying on message.",
        "Nasa\u2019s next cargo run to the International Space Station will be delayed for at least two weeks after black mould was found in two fabric bags used for packing clothing, food and other supplies. The source of the mould, common in humid climates like Florida\u2019s, is under investigation by Nasa and Lockheed Martin, which prepares cargo for launch aboard two commercial carriers, Orbital ATK and privately owned SpaceX.",
        "A person with knowledge of the deal says the Dallas Cowboys have agreed on a contract with quarterback Mark Sanchez, who will back up rookie Dak Prescott while Tony Romo recovers from a back injury. Sanchez was released by the Denver Broncos on Saturday, clearing the way for the veteran to sign with another team. The person confirmed the agreement to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the contract can\u2019t be signed until Sunday.",
        "Romania\u2019s Social Democrats have easily won parliamentary elections a year after a major drive forced the last socialist prime minister from power. Speaking on Sunday after exit polls showed similar results, the chairman of the Social Democrats, Liviu Dragnea, said: \u201cThere should be no doubt who won the elections. Romanians want to feel at home in their own country and I want Romania to be a good home for all Romanians. \u201d His Social Democratic party won about 46% of the vote, with the Liberals coming second with over 20%.",
        "Silicon Valley has, paradoxically, become one of the most vocal proponents of universal basic income (UBI). Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, web guru Tim O\u2019Reilly and a cadre of other Silicon Valley denizens have expressed support for the \u201csocial vaccine of the 21st century\u201d and influential incubator Y Combinator announced on 31 May that it will be conducting its own basic income experiment with a pilot study of 100 families in Oakland, California \u2014 a short hop over the San Francisco bay.",
        "The iron law of the market is that you do not stifle demand by trying to stifle supply. It applies to drugs. It applies to alcohol. It applies to sex. It applies to ivory. For a generation, an international bureaucracy of UN officials and NGOs has been trying to stamp out ivory supply in Africa, much as it has been trying to stamp out cocaine supply in Latin America. All this does is increase price. For animals and for many people in countries across Africa, this has been disastrous."
