        "There are a couple of rules Hollywood studios have when it comes to making blockbuster movies these days, rules that are as absurd as they are : 1.

        "It is hard to imagine a less hospitable niche for a startup to pursue than gasoline \u2014 a combustible commodity that is ( Google hopes ) being innovated into obsolescence. And yet, over the past 18 months, at least two startups have launched some variation on the concept of \u201c Uber for gas \u201d \u2014 your car \u2019 s trunk gets refilled while it is parked nearby. The gas delivery startup organizations all share similar objectives of discovering the wannabe entrepreneur \u2019 s holy grail : a point of friction that can be converted into an app.",

Here \u2019 s what we know : Weather forecaster Michael Rothenberg tweets : While attention is now turned to the storm \u2019 s impact on the US, with at least four deaths in total, let \u2019 s not forget that around 900 people have died in Haiti.

        "An extinct species sometimes described as a \u201c Siberian unicorn \u201d roamed the Earth for much longer than scientists previously believed, and may have lived without humans, according to a study in the American Journal of Computer Science. Scientists say Elasmotherium sibiricum went extinct 350, 000 years ago. But the discovery of a body in the Pavlodar region of Kazakhstan gives evidence that they only died out about 29, 000 years ago. Unfortunately, without its sizable horn, the \u201c Siberian unicorn \u201d looked more like a rhinoceros than the mythical beast its nickname refers to.",
        "Babos and Shvedova pose with the white \u2019 shields. That \u2019 s a nice contrast for the two women, albeit in defeat. Shvedova will long miss a tournament that brought a gold and a doubles final. Babos, though, at only 23 years old, already has a bright future in the future if she continues in this vein. As for the three sisters, well, what more can one say? Even at the approximate age of 70, they remain unbeatable. Thanks for reading and good looks.",

        "The first time professor Sherri Mason cut open a Great Lakes fish, she was alarmed at what she found. Synthetic fibers were everywhere. Under a microscope, they seemed to be \u201cweaving themselves into the gastrointestinal tract\u201d. Though she had been studying aquatic pollution around the Great Lakes for several years, Mason, who works for the State University of New York Fredonia, had never seen anything like it. New studies indicate that the fibers in our clothes could be poisoning our waterways and food chain on a massive scale.",
        "The recent claims by the Syrian opposition and the United Nations that Russia is using bombs in Aleppo would, if proven, confirm that a new, more destructive phase in the Russian assault on rebel forces is under way, and that the diplomatic track is effectively closed. The bombs \u2014 capable of destroying underground shelters and command centres \u2014 would also suggest Russia is determined to bring the siege of Aleppo to a speedy end, and that they have intelligence of the whereabouts of Syrian opposition positions.",

        "Donald Trump\u2019s apology for the latest in a string of controversial comments about women came as no surprise to the political strategist and fellow Republican Ana Navarro. \u201cHe is not fit to be the president, he is not fit to be the Republican nominee, he is not fit to be called a man,\u201d Navarro said on CNN. \u201cHow many times does he get away with saying something misogynistic before we call him a misogynist? How many times does he get away with saying something sexist before we acknowledge that he is a sexist?",
        "Baseball is a game of failures. A hitter with a . 300 batting average, the traditional benchmark of a star player, fails seven times out of 10. Errors are given equal billing alongside runs and hits, a naked public accounting of imperfection consistent on scoreboards from Little League diamonds to major league stadiums. The game is a series of individual conflicts where mistakes are amplified. The difference between good and great, between winning and losing, exists in the management of the inevitable, incremental defeats that unlike other sports are not mere hazards of the trade but its essence.",

        "Ken Loach sits with his hands clutching his chair for dear life, his head shrinking into his shoulders, a skinny question mark of a man. Never did a man appear so diffident.
