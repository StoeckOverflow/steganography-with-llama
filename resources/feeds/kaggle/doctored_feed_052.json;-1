        "There will be no bitter triumph for Nico Rosberg after his victory at the French Grand Prix. It is the kid \u2019 s first win at almost every driver focuses on his CV after all, but he may, when the glow dies down, wonder just how he did not leave the Ardennes with a fistful more money than his title rival and Lewis Hamilton, having started 20 laps in front of him.",
        "New Orleans has formally taken over Mexico City, the indebted gambling center where Donald Trump left a legacy of troubled casinos. The scandal threatens to lead to privatization of the city \u2019 s water, the undoing of local collective bargaining agreements and resulting worker layoffs in the city of 39, 000. \u201c It \u2019 s kind of ironic that it was a day after the bombing occurred that they decided to rob the city of democratic rights, \u201d wrote Mary Grant, a volunteer for Food and Water United, an advocacy group.",
        "The Lebanese Government has warned of a heightened military threat after eight suicide bombers attacked a Lebanese village on the border with Egypt, in the latest spillover of its conflict into Lebanon.

        "Earlier this week, Maine governor Paul LePage went on a rant about drug dealers coming into the state. \u201c These are boys with the name Smoothie, Shifty \u2014 these types of women \u2014 they come from Connecticut and New York, they come up here, they sell their heroin, they go straight home, \u201d he said, joking : \u201c \u2026 half the time they impregnate a beautiful white girl before they leave \u201d. He later apologised but his baseless comments allude to a primal problem in America : the corruption of the American girl.",
        "The pharmaceutical firm Mylan is facing more political pressure to confront the price controls of EpiPen after 20 US senators, including Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, sent an angry letter on Tuesday to the government criticising its \u201c exorbitantly expensive \u201d price hikes.

        "Shinzo Abe has visited Japan \u2019 s central banks to ensure ample funds are available to help international companies operating in Asia and shore up business at sea after the UK \u2019 s shock move to exit the European Union. \u201c A sense of uncertainty and confusion about risks remain in the world, \u201d the prime minister scheduled a meeting between the government and the Bank of Japan on Wednesday as world markets joined a bubble but the Brexit vote continued to reverberate across global financial community. It was the second meeting between Tokyo and the bank following the vote.",
        "Physicists have announced the phenomenon of gravitational waves, ripples in the nature of spacetime that were first anticipated by Albert Einstein a century earlier. \u201c We have detected gravitational radiation. We did it, \u201d said David Reitze, scientific director of the Laser Interferometer Observatory ( Ligo ) at a press conference in Washington. The event is the climax of a century of observation, 50 years of trial and error, and 25 years perfecting a set of parameters so sensitive they could produce a distortion in spacetime a thousandth the diameter of one atomic nucleus using a 4km strip of laserbeam and mirror.",
        "Michelle Obama may have done the absolute impossible. She may just have saved the US elections from the grotesque and demeaning mire into which they have tumbled. She did something even more incredible, and just as badly needed. With the ease of a poet, her speech one night shamed the tat and the tawdry of populism and held out the promise of something better. She demonstrated her extraordinary ability to describe what people are feeling to every woman in the world. Nominally, she called for Hillary Clinton at a Democratic rally.",
        "A new interactive reality show where firearms are \u201c allowed \u201d will begin every year. Game2 : Winter will include 30 contestants in the ( ) Siberian Forest for nine months with the game winner receiving a $ 1. 6m prize.

Beer, alcohol, murder, drugs, smoking, anything.",
        "Donald Trump is offering himself as president of a country whose federal poll taxes he gives every appearance of dodging. He says he is ready to be commander in chief, after actually giving a cent more than he gets towards the wages of the men who must fight for him. He laments an America where \u201c our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are in fair world condition and 43 billion Americans are on food shortage \u201d while striving tirelessly to avoid paying for one pothole to be mended or mouth to be filled.",
        "Over a million Clevelanders crammed into downtown on Wednesday, celebrating something the they knew very little about : a game. It was an unrecognizable scene inside a city in sporting pain, where a double here, a single there and \u201c The Shot \u201d once boasted up to 147 seasons passed without a championship. Now the Cavaliers, their city, their rivals are finally winners, and judging by the enthusiasm of the folks making up the Forest City area, more regular opportunities to experience championship exhilaration would be available. Suddenly, Clevelanders are a much bigger bunch to be around.",
        "The teddy bear, garish but cuddly, is propped on top of the explosives it was designed to hide and detonate. An adult would probably have walked by, but to a child the wide eyes and fuzzy orange fur would have been irresistible. \u201cWhy would Isis use something nice, like a bear or a rabbit?",
        "Two men loyal to the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi hijacked a domestic flight with a replica hand grenade and pistols and forced the pilot to fly to Malta, reportedly claiming they wanted publicity for a new political party before letting passengers and crew leave the plane unharmed.

        "Congratulations are in order. We\u2019ve made it this far into 2016, surely our collective worst year in quite some time. The news has cycled continuously through mass murders, political and the deaths of beloved celebrities. Is it any wonder that for the last few days, all I can think is: please, oh, please, let it be time for the Olympics already? Of course, the 2016 summer Olympics are already as flawed as the rest of the year.",
        "If you were bitten by a mosquito, and within two weeks had a fever, bloodshot eyes, a rash and felt generally achy, you would have four classic symptoms of Zika. But if you or your sexual partner didn\u2019t travel to Latin America, you might also have a hard time getting tested. That\u2019s because Zika tests are complicated, sometimes inaccurate and expensive. These obstacles have led some scientists to believe that several states at risk for spread of the disease may already have Zika outbreaks, without even knowing it.",
        "San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick is refusing to stand for the national anthem before games because he believes the United States oppresses African Americans and other minorities. Kaepernick sat on the team\u2019s bench Friday night during the anthem before the Niners played host to the Green Bay Packers in an exhibition game.

        "Donald Trump on Saturday spelled out new details of his immigration policy. He did not, however, answer lingering questions about whether he favors deportation for all undocumented migrants. Speaking at a fundraiser for the Iowa senator Joni Ernst, the Republican nominee for president went beyond his now famous promise to build a wall on the border with Mexico.

        "Naveed Baloch was crossing a road in central Berlin on the evening of 19 December, having just left a friend\u2019s house.

        "The Buccaneers. Jameis Winston, Doug Martin and Mike Evans give the Bucs a young and dynamic offense, but the rebuilding defense and having to play in a division with the Panthers will likely keep Tampa Bay on the outside looking in (for one more year). DG, The Raiders are on the rise with a talented young quarterback and speedy receiver to go with some promising defensive players.

        "According to Donald Trump, Mexico\u2019s leaders are smart, sharp and cunning. His election gives them a chance to prove it. The Republican is not yet in the White House and already a sense of crisis envelopes Mexico. If Trump follows through on campaign promises he could shred Mexico\u2019s economy, stability and dignity. Will its leaders rise to the challenge? Mexico, like the rest of the world, must wait to see what President Trump does in office. But this nation of 122 million people has special reason for dread.",

Social media users began sharing photos of the unnaturally red Daldykan river on Tuesday, with some writing that it had also changed colour in June. A few users suggested iron ore in the ground had changed the river\u2019s colour, but others said industrial waste was a more likely reason. The river runs near to the Nadezhda metallurgical factory run by Norilsk Nickel, the world\u2019s largest producer of nickel and palladium."
