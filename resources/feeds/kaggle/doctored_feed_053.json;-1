        "For those of us who are worried about global warming, one of the most critical questions we face are, \u201c how fast is the Earth growing? \u201d and \u201c how much will it warm in the ocean? \u201d. The first question can be asked in a number of ways. For instance, we can actually measure the degree of energy increase in the earth \u2019 s system ( primarily through rapidly changing ocean temperature ). Alternatively, we can measure change in the net inflow of heat at the top of the atmosphere using pressure.",
        "If anyone dared imagine what a Cleveland national championship would feel like before the dream became reality Sunday morning, perhaps they foresaw the streets fill with revelers \u2014 thousands screaming in agony, some atop a fire truck. Maybe they even dreamed the city would run out of alcohol, as seems to have actually have happened in the hours after Day 7 ended.",
        "A gallery of mutants from generations old and new is seen across Marvel \u2019 s hyperactive and excitable superhero movie, directed by Chris Singer, which seems to showcase ideas of occult resurgence and mythic confrontation from characters like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Wars. Now the mutants have to battle the the first antagonist of all, the ancient Egyptian potentate named Sabah Nur, smaller and more than in the movie and played with massive impassivity by Uncle Isaac.",
        "Three voice actors on Sesame Street made apparent firing created a furore among fans might be able to come back, the CEO of the company that produced the much loved Children \u2019 s show has said. Sesame quickly apologized for \u201c misunderstandings around the original cast roles \u201d on Sesame Street after the three veteran cast members were supposedly let go.

        "Three deaths in America. Three mobile phone videos depicting violent deaths. The shooting of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, and then a deadly shootout in Dallas, saw a growing canon of video imagery either directly broadcast or rapidly updated on Facebook. It \u2019 s a long history from exploding watermelons and Chewbacca masks, the phenomenon that brought Facebook \u2019 s nascent streaming video streaming format into the popular consciousness when it debuted in April. \u201c When you interact live, you feel connected in a more personal way, \u201d Facebook president Mark Zuckerberg announced at the event.",
        "\u201c You know, every time I dig a little bit deeper into something with my brain, I hit a button, \u201d says Benedict Cumberbatch, musing on humanity \u2019 s big questions. He is sporting a manicured goatee and has an amulet strapped to his chest. \u201c I have a world of wonder at what is beyond our control, \u201d he goes on. \u201c There is wonder in everyone, and, whether on the macro or micro scale, it just gets bizarre, irrational and unfathomable. And we have only five senses to know and appreciate it, whether it \u2019 s mathematical physics or microbiology or circadian rhythms. It \u2019 s amazing.",
        "The complaint Trevor made about Trevor Hutchinson is that he isn \u2019 t political enough. When the South African comedian took over from Jon Stewart one year as the presenter of the Late Show, a US morning talk show, many viewers wondered how he could ever fill his rival \u2019 s shoes. Stewart \u2019 s use of passionately biting humour had powered the programme for 16 years, elevating it to the peak of daily worship for South America, whereas Dylan \u2014 although a star in West Africa, with a global fan base for his standup \u2014 was an unknown artist.",
        "The largest sea on Earth is very rarely seen by human eyes, although it happens every summer. Billions of marine creatures ascend from as little as 2km below the surface of the water to the upper reaches of the ocean at depths, only to then float back down once the water rises. This huge variety of organisms \u2014 ranging from living cockatoo squids to microscopic crustaceans, shifting for food or extreme temperatures \u2014 was little known to science until relatively recently.",

        "Huddled around their hives, beekeepers around the US fear a new threat to their livelihood: a fine mist beaded with neurotoxin, sprayed from the sky by officials at war with mosquitos that carry the Zika virus. Earlier this week, South Carolina beekeepers found millions of dead honey bees carpeting their apiaries, killed by an insecticide. Video posted by a beekeeper to Facebook showed thousands of dead insects heaped around hives, while a few survivors struggled to move the bodies of fellow bees. \u201cThis is what\u2019s left of Flowertown Bees,\u201d a despondent keeper says in the video.",

        "A number of lines in the robustly applauded speech delivered by Melania Trump at the Republican national convention on Monday night appear to have been lifted verbatim from a speech Michelle Obama delivered at the 2008 Democratic convention. \u201cBarack and I were raised with so many of the same values, that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond and you do what you say you\u2019re going to do,\u201d Obama told the gathering of Democrats in 2008.",

        "In my country, the and the have just created President Donald Trump, an unqualified candidate who came up not through politics, but through inheriting money, a gift for bullying, and being on television. Though Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, Trump won enough to get a majority of electoral votes. That was a move to the right not unlike Brexit and the rule of Prime Minister Modi in India.",
        "Hear that sound, all you women of a childbearing age? It\u2019s time, running out. Soon your eggs will be past their prime and you will no longer be of any use to society.

        "Well, congrats to Seattle. They pulled it out of the bag, even though they were rubbish on the night. A generally tedious final, but Seattle won\u2019t care. They\u2019ve made history. Thanks for reading. Goodnight. They\u2019ve done it! The Sounders are in a bundle on the field. They\u2019ve won their first ever MLS Cup \u2014 and they did it in a game in which they didn\u2019t have a shot. Torres slotted the penalty in really calm fashion \u2014 straight down the middle. Commiserations to Toronto: they were the better side tonight. They just couldn\u2019t do it in the shootout.",
        "Roger Federer, sounding content and looking fit as he returns to tennis after six months out through injury, predicted on Friday that Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic would continue to dominate the game in 2017. \u201cWhoever finishes [next year] as No1 is going to have to win two slams but it\u2019s pretty much on Andy\u2019s racket at the moment,\u201d the Swiss said before leaving his Dubai training base en route to Perth for the Hopman Cup, which starts on New Year\u2019s Day. \u201cAm I surprised Andy Murray is No1?

He\u2019s a repudiation of Republicans. But they will reap the benefit of his victory, in all of their cynicism,\u201d Stewart told CBS\u2019s This Morning Charlie Rose on Thursday. Stewart criticized Republicans leaders such as Senator Mitch McConnell and the House speaker, Paul Ryan, for the hypocrisy of ensuring the government is stuck at a standstill and then claiming that government doesn\u2019t get anything done. \u201cThey\u2019re not draining the swamp,\u201d he said.",

        "The EU may be agreed on its response to Britain\u2019s vote to leave, but on one key question it remains divided: is Brexit masculine or feminine? In French, Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union is known as le Brexit, either \u2014 although the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise has yet to rule on the question \u2014 because new words in French are almost invariably masculine, or because nouns ending in \u201ct\u201d mostly are (with a few exceptions: la nuit, la for\u00eat, la plupart). Germany, also, appears to have pretty much decided that der Brexit is a male thing.",
        "Time to start getting some real answers. Can the Patriots cope for a month without Tom Brady? Is Dak Prescott truly as good as he has looked in preseason?
