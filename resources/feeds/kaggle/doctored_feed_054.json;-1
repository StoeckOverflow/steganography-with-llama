        "Loretta Lynch, the assistant attorney general, wrote on Friday that her meeting with Bill Clinton this week had \u201c created a shadow \u201d over the justice department \u2019 s investigation into Hillary Clinton \u2019 s use of a private FBI server while she was secretary of state. Lynch said she could \u201c fully accept \u201d whatever recommendations were made by the governor and prosecutors, but sought to quell doubts stemming from the encounter with Bill Gates, at an airport in Phoenix, reiterating that the police department process for the Clinton case remained largely independent.",
        "Huma Abedin has been the reluctant protagonist of two political psychodramas in the previous year. The first \u2014 became painfully public strains in her marriage to Anthony Weiner, the future New York congressman \u2014 concluding, perhaps predictably, on Monday with information that she had decided to separate from him following yet another sexting matter. But the second \u2014 Abedin \u2019 s emerging status as a central figure in the unexpected return of Hillary Clinton to the White House \u2014 would be only just beginning and remains of even greater public career.",
        "Police arrested Abdul Razak Ali Artan as the assailant in an Oregon State University bus on Monday, hours after he drove into a crowd of people, overturned the car and stabbed bystanders with a steak knife. Police reported Artan, who was fatally shot by police, was a student at the university. The university president, Michael Drake, said he had heard it was Artan \u2019 s first victim, but would not provide further information because the investigation is ongoing. Unconfirmed sources, citing anonymous sources, said Artan was born in Kuwait and had permanent residency in the country.",
        "Two of the largest summits ever convened on conflict and mass migration took place in New York this week : one by the United Nations and the other by the White House. This should be the reform moment when the community comes together to find a broken system that is going to meet contemporary societal challenges. But a combination of global wars and government make this unlikely. Tomorrow \u2019 s world meeting will focus more on basic principles of commitment than practical practice.",
        "Bad idea if you were planning a winter expedition to Mars : new research has shown that the 225m km trip to the Red Planet won \u2019 t just cause you bad jet lag \u2014 it \u2019 ll completely fry your brain. The study, cited in Scientific Reports, has concluded that the levels of cosmic radiation travellers to Mars may be exposed to could lead to brain damage, coma and chronic dementia. This is somewhat ironic as the US is currently fixated on returning to Mars in the next several decades.",
        "The World Cup of Hockey is fun. Along with the Olympics, it \u2019 s the only true tournament on the international hockey field. It \u2019 s played on NHL rinks under NHL rules, so there \u2019 s less of an excitement for the league \u2019 s fans. And it doesn \u2019 t automatically interrupt the season. All in all, it \u2019 s a really hard concept not to love. But as we \u2019 ve explained in the past, not many things is what hockey players do. It \u2019 s kind of our thing.",
        "Michelle Forbes is in early talks to take on the role of rock singer Janis Joplin in a new biopic directed by Jim Durkin, the director of Martha Marcy May Marlene. The film, titled Janis, is based the singer \u2019 s sister Lauren Joplin \u2019 s book Love, Janis, which chronicles the singer \u2019 s letters to guide her life from the coffee house roots of her career through to Woodstock, when she struggled with alcohol and cocaine addiction to cope with her growing celebrity. She died in 1970 aged 27 from a heroin overdose a fourth album was released posthumously.",
        "When I got up this early I didn \u2019 t think I \u2019 d go to sleep with a vision of Zach Galifianakis sharting in a swimming pool. There \u2019 s nothing in my liquor cabinet or on my liquor cabinet that can help me right now. In May 2015, I reviewed Jared Hess \u2019 s Don Verdean and, after suffering through it and his previous catastrophe, Gentlemen Broncos, I vowed I would never see one of Hess \u2019 s movies again.",
        "Trevor Miller has compared Donald Trump \u2019 s America to South American apartheid in a new direction for the New York Mets. The Daily Show writer has expressed his disappointment and regret over the decision to elect the new TV star as governor while calling for unity as the final weapon against him. \u201c The past century has been so polarizing and noxious that even I find myself becoming caught up in the extreme grandstanding and vitriol, \u201d he adds. \u201c But with extremes come deadlock and the death of power.",
        "is a recurring trope in many film and TV genres. Whether it \u2019 s Marty McFly in Back to the Future, Tom Brady in Minority Report, or the movies Timeless and Frequency, it is something couch girls love to nerd out to. While Oprah Winfrey and director Charles DuVernay \u2019 s Queen Sugar II isn \u2019 t a fantasy, it does deal with time travel on a symbolic plane.",
        "I have some news for the news media : the 2016 election isn \u2019 t a contest. It \u2019 s not a football game, or a political TV show. It \u2019 s long past time to stop treating it as such. It \u2019 s long past time to stop the wild anticipation of Donald Trump \u2019 s pick of a and to start seeing if this presidential ticket is emotionally and mentally capable of dealing with the challenges we face at home and overseas. It \u2019 s time to quit indulging in the pretense that there is anything like a Donald Trump worldview or policy statement, at home and overseas.",
        "The Copa del Rey final was into extra time and still nobody could separate the defending champions from the Europa League winners when Lionel Messi scored the most perfect of passes and Jordi S\u00e1nchez scored the goal that led Barcelona towards the championship. As elated and exhausted bodies rose up in the corner of the pitch, fans in yellow, red and white celebrated at the other, south end of the Vicente Calder\u00f3n.",
        "Here is the latest of the rebooted Star Trek franchise with Michael Lin ( of the Fast And Furious franchise ) taking over direction \u2014 and the first in which Britain \u2019 s own Simon Pegg assumes responsibilities, with TV producer Doug Jung. Pegg injects elements of fun and wit and even doesn \u2019 t hesitate to give his own new role, chief officer Montgomery \u201c Scotty \u201d Scott, a much more dramatic significance than might otherwise have been the case. However, he naturally also adheres to the tradition of responding to Captain Montgomery \u2019 s requests for emergency security measures with frantic calls beginning \u201c I cannae.",
        "I love a television show that makes people talk, and particularly one that makes its viewers ask the big questions. The new western drama Westworld is slow, pretentious, confusing, and my new favourite, with its grandiose concerns about playing God and how sentient a sentient creation should be. Tapping into a worry first planted in me by an illicit sleepover viewing of Terminator 2, it is a exploration of what happens when we evolve too far, and what happens if we give robots guns.",
        "Maria Sharapova has suggested the International Tennis Federation was keen to make an example of her. The ITF\u2019s doping ban, imposed following Sharapova\u2019s positive test for the drug meldonium in January, was reduced to 15 months by the court of arbitration for sport on Tuesday. The former Wimbledon champion and world No1, in her first interview since the Cas ruling, said: \u201cI got a suspension but they [ITF] wanted four years for me. I went through the ITF hearing, which was in front of an arbitration panel which was chosen by the ITF.",
        "US secretary of state John Kerry said on Saturday that Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels had released two US citizens. The announcement comes days after the US\u2019s first direct involvement in the country\u2019s civil war. The US has been backing a Saudi coalition as it assists the Yemeni government\u2019s fight against the Houthis. Kerry would not identify the two Americans, who he said were freed on Saturday as part of complicated diplomatic arrangement that included airlifts for Yemenis wounded by an airstrike this past week by the coalition. Those individuals were taken to Oman for treatment.",

        "It\u2019s going to get worse for Donald Trump and his Republican party. Much worse. Normal candidates might have realized they were bumping along the bottom of their election \u2014 if not, their life \u2014 when video emerged of them bragging, as a newlywed, about forcing themselves on women, genitals and all. But not the man who promises to make America great again. No, Donald Trump\u2019s apology video was even more incompetent and incoherent than the rest of his campaign to date. And that\u2019s quite an achievement for a man who has attacked a grieving, Gold Star family.",
        "Cheyroux, 56, doesn\u2019t remember his mother\u2019s face or the name of the road he lived on as a child, but when he sees the volcanoes from the aircraft window, for the first time in decades he feels at home. The last time he made this journey was in 1967 he was seven years old and flying in the opposite direction \u2014 from R\u00e9union Island, where he was born, to France, where he now lives. \u201cI remember being on that plane as a child, and being so scared that I was crying.",
        "A fake news story has touched off a Twitter confrontation between nuclear powers Pakistan and Israel, the latest disturbing incident of fabricated stories having a serious impact in the real world. The exchange of tense public words between two countries with a difficult relationship and no diplomatic ties comes the same month that a fake news story about a child abuse ring prompted a gunman to fire shots inside a pizza restaurant in Washington.",
        "Any Given Wednesday, Bill Simmons\u2019s new TV series, was sandwiched between screenings of The Martian and Lucy, two recent films chronicling the struggles of a lost individual to make sense of strange and hostile surroundings, for its premiere on HBO last night. The scheduling was apt, because for long stretches of the show, Simmons, making his debut on TV after a decade as American sportswriting\u2019s brightest court jester, seemed as disoriented by his unfamiliar new format as Matt Damon was by Mars.",
        "Gonzalo Higua\u00edn has become the third most expensive player in history after signing for Juventus from Napoli in a deal worth \u20ac90m (\u00a375. 3m). Higua\u00edn\u2019s transfer places him behind the Real Madrid pair Gareth Bale (\u00a385m) and Cristiano Ronaldo (\u00a380m) on the record list in a move that could clear the way for Manchester United\u2019s move for Paul Pogba. A statement on juventus. com read: \u201cJuventus can today confirm it has purchased the registration rights of Gonzalo Higua\u00edn for \u20ac90m, payable in two financial years. The player has agreed a contract.",
        "It\u2019s a sunny Saturday morning in South Los Angeles, but Nuvia Perez is keeping her three boys inside. \u201cThey don\u2019t go out to play,\u201d said Perez, 37, whose front door faces a former industrial site in the heart of Jordan Downs, a housing project. \u201cIn the housing office, they say everything\u2019s all right and not to worry,\u201d said Perez in Spanish. \u201cBut they have found contamination. \u201d More than a year ago, family nurse practitioner Amanda Markusson noticed a cluster of elevated blood lead levels in the kids she treats near Jordan Downs and started recording test results.",
        "Three years ago, Apple boss Tim Cook was emphatic. Appearing before a US senate committee, the man who runs the world\u2019s largest company told the politicians straight: Apple had no intention of repatriating billions of dollars of profits from its international operations until the US Treasury slashed corporate taxation. \u201cI have no current plan to bring them back at the current tax rate,\u201d Cook said. It was a response \u2014 one of many \u2014 that rankled with the committee\u2019s chair, Carl Levin.",
        "\u2018The Tour is finished,\u201d wrote its founder Henri Desgrange in 1904 after the second edition of the race was wrecked by cheating and crowds intervening violently to manipulate the race in favour of their local heroes. Desgrange added that his brainchild had been \u201ckilled by its own success and the blind passions it has unleashed\u201d.",
        "Samuel L Jackson and Star Wars really ought to have been a marriage made in Jedi heaven, if such a knotty metaphysical concept can be presumed to exist. On one side, an actor capable of delivering lines with such force of venom that mere sentences of English crystallise into almighty rhetorical thunderbolts on the other, the greatest space opera saga of all time.",
        "Of all the things they\u2019re talking about at the Republican national convention in Cleveland this week, one thing not being discussed is Jon Snow becoming the King of the North and Cersei Lannister taking control of the Iron Throne. That\u2019s because, according to a study by the GOP is not down with GoT. According to the study by a company that tracks awareness about TV series, Game of Thrones is Democrats\u2019 favorite show. However, it doesn\u2019t even figure in the top 10 of Republicans\u2019 preferred viewing. Maybe Game of Thrones just hits too close to home.",
        "A West Virginia Republican lawmaker said on Sunday his comments made on Twitter calling for Hillary Clinton\u2019s public execution were not meant to be taken literally. The House of Delegates member Mike Folk said that his tweet on Friday over Clinton\u2019s use of a private email system while she served as secretary of state was \u201chyperbole\u201d. In the tweet, Folk said the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee \u201cshould be tried for treason, murder, and crimes against the US Constitution \u2026 then hung on the Mall in Washington DC\u201d.",
        "It is B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo\u2019s day off, and she wants to get straight down to business. No sooner is she through the door of her agent\u2019s office in Paris than she is steering me into one of the bright conference rooms, yanking out chairs for both of us and plonking her belongings on the table. We have met to discuss The Childhood of a Leader, a brooding psychological drama directed by the young actor Brady Corbet, who Bejo says is \u201ca little genius\u201d. She plays a nameless, emotionally frigid mother in century France.",
        "This wasn\u2019t the first time we\u2019d shared a bill with the Beatles. A few years earlier, they were our band, when we headlined the Cavern in Liverpool. We really admired them. I was the trombonist in the Mike Cotton Sound, a footnote to the 1960s music scene. On this occasion, we were their support band we are pictured here at the press call for Another Beatles Christmas Show, a to their successful production a year earlier."
