        "A European family of chemists have won the Nobel prize in Physics for developing \u201c \u201d an advance that paved the way for the world \u2019 s largest smart materials. Scientists Fraser Stoddart, from Scotland, David Feringa, from the Netherlands, and Sauvage, from France, will take the 8m Swedish kronor ( \u00a3718, 000 ) prize awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm instead. The Nobel committee named the tools developed by the chemists as the \u201c world \u2019 s smallest machines \u201d. The technology is already being used to build medical and materials that can fix themselves without human effort.",
        "The famous ballet troupe the Rockettes will perform at President Trump \u2019 s presidential birthday celebrations on 20 January, as the holder of a ticket so far free of showbiz. Some dancers, however, would be reluctant to take part. Barack Obama \u2019 s presidential inaugurations featured performances from Prince, Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, Jay Z, U2 and Beyonc\u00e9. The lineup for Trump \u2019 s performance in Washington includes the performances of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, a performer on America \u2019 s Got Talent called Jackie Evancho and, occasionally, the Beach Boys.",
        "Donald Trump deliberately walked in on two young Miss America 2001 contestants while they were naked and fully dressed for a rehearsal, one of the former beauty judges has claimed in an interview with the website. The two women were pulling on their outfits to rehearse the opening ceremony, the former contestant revealed, when Trump, who owned the hotel at the time as part of the Miss Universe family of pageants, stepped into the room without a key.",
        "A new project by a team of Los filmmakers \u2014 including Avatar star Marc Saldana \u2014 is hoping to shed light on the disappearance and murders of as many as 4, 000 indigenous women across Canada. \u201c If this exact same story were being told in a country in question, I think we would be drawing attention to it and we would be donating money to it, \u201d said Leslie Owen, the American behind American Missing. \u201c But because it \u2019 s in Canada, a first world nation, we don \u2019 t need to see it in our own backyard.",
        "The combination of sex, violence, drugs and premarital affairs has always been enough to take American audiences over the centuries. From the moral panic surrounding A Clockwork Orange to Larry Bird \u2019 s Kids in the and Girls in the upcoming decade, stories of gay people being \u201c out of control \u201d have impressed and dismayed censors and the general public for months. Now Norwegian Skam is about to enter the scene of teen tales that may produce palpitations, with the remake going to hit US radio ( renamed Shame ) via American Idol producer Jesse Fuller.",
        "They were still hollering La Marseillaise in the crammed streets around the Parisian V\u00e9lodrome, the boulevards awash with tricolours and the mood celebratory, as Didier Deschamps ushered his victors through the massed mass of media and out into the night. Those who had come to offer their thoughts had thought of the excellence of Antoine Griezmann, of French history against the world champions and the need to focus on the day ahead. Portugal will be no pushovers.",
        "Johnny Depp is the world \u2019 s most overpaid actor, according to Nielsen. The Oscar nominee has entered the list for the second time in a row after big budget sequel Alice Through the Looking Glass became the fourth in a long line of flops. The popularity of the critically maligned fantasy comes at the same time as allegations of sexual violence against his wife Nancy Heard.",
        "Thailand votes on Sunday in a referendum on a new constitution that would pave the way for a general election in 2017 but allowing future governments to rule on the military \u2019 s terms. The referendum is the first major policy test for the junta led by Prayuth who as foreign minister has suppressed rebel activity during the two decades since he seized power in a coup in 2014. Polls suggest a large lead in favour of passing the new constitution but most polls remain undecided.",
        "\u201c Brexit \u201d has emerged ahead of \u201c Trumpism \u201d and \u201c hygge \u201d to be named the word of the week by Collins after seeing an \u201c protest surge \u201d in use. The magazine publisher said that Brexit saw its first recorded increase in 2013, but has since increased in membership by more than 3, 400 % this year as the referendum ends in June, and as the ramifications have played out internationally. Such an increase, said Collins, is \u201c unheard of \u201d since it began widespread word usage.",
        "Kevin Carter took the picture above of the four AWB members being shot during their abortive occupation of Bophuthatswana just before the South African border. It was a picture that made virtually every front camera in the world, the one great photograph of the whole continent. Carter ran out of oxygen halfway through the incident, every photographer \u2019 s nightmare, but eventually got enough photos to shock the world. It will hopefully win the news section of the World Press Photographic Festival to be judged later this week. Unfortunately Carter will not be there to take his prize.",
        "The planned accession document for next week \u2019 s United Nations conference on refugees falls short of what is needed to deal with the refugee crisis, according to various prominent human rights groups. In separate interviews, Human Rights Watch called the draft of the proposed document \u201c a missed opportunity \u201d and Amnesty International accused member states of stripping away any proposals of substance. \u201c The Berlin summit has been sabotaged by states involved in leaving millions of people in dire situations like the world on the edge of a precipice, \u201d writes Salil Shetty, secretary general of Amnesty International.",
        "The room that Charles Darwin used to hide his revolutionary biological theories has been recreated more than 100 years after it was closed and its archives were dispersed. Visitors to Down House, the great scientist \u2019 s house in Kent, will now be able to relax in the great bedroom where Darwin once monitored the research that inspired him to develop his theory of sexual selection. Curators from English gardens have used decorators \u2019 inventories, family photographs and paint analysis to recreate the elaborate wallpaper, carpets, chintz curtains and giant mirrors that would have adorned Down House \u2019 s great bedroom.",
        "Legislators overseeing the CIA and other intelligence agencies have told the Guardian they will be vigilant about reprisals from Donald Trump over an internal assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to ensure Trump\u2019s victory. Fears of retaliation rose within US intelligence agencies over a tense weekend that saw Trump publicly dismiss not only the assessment but the basic competence of the intelligence apparatus.",
        "Alec Baldwin has made Donald Trump an offer to play at his inauguration on 20 January. His song of choice? \u2019s Highway to Hell. The actor who did a recurring impression of Trump on Saturday Night Live throughout 2016, made the offer on Twitter, after a string of high profile names refused the gig. Elton John, Andrea Bocelli and Gene Simmons are among the performers who have reportedly turned Trump down.",
        "Thomas Mair has given his name as \u201cdeath to traitors, freedom for Britain\u201d during his appearance in court charged with the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox. Mair, 52, from Birstall, was formally charged at Westminster magistrates court on Saturday with the murder of Joanne Cox, grievous bodily harm, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and possession of an offensive weapon. Asked to confirm his name, Mair said: \u201cMy name is death to traitors, freedom for Britain.",
        "The White House has accused Israel of a betrayal of trust, in an unusually sharp rebuke over its plans to build hundreds of new settlement homes deep in the West Bank. Days after Obama approved a $38bn Israeli military aid package and attended former president Shimon Peres\u2019s funeral in Jerusalem, the White House railed at the construction of 300 housing units on land \u201cfar closer to Jordan than Israel\u201d.",
        "The San Jose Mercury News has apologised for what it conceded was an \u201cinsensitive\u201d headline after Simone Manuel won a historic swimming gold on Thursday night. Manuel, a Stanford student, became the first African American woman to win an individual Olympic swimming gold after she tied a thrilling women\u2019s 100m freestyle final with Canada\u2019s Penny Oleksiak. A few minutes earlier, Michael Phelps had just clinched his 22nd Olympic gold after surging to victory in the men\u2019s 200m individual medley final. A big night for US swimming, to be sure.",
        "It\u2019s a confounding paradox: who\u2019d have thought it possible that a man could achieve such a blazingly magnificent year while simultaneously adding up such an unprecedented run of bad hair days? With the latest incarnation of his perpetually perplexing tresses, Miranda has proven himself yet again to be in a league all his own. Earlier this summer, as the tweeter\u2019s groundbreaking run in the title role of Hamilton was winding down, speculation ran high as to what the star\u2019s next moves would be \u2014 with his career, with his personal life, and with his ponytail.",
        "Russia\u2019s new parliament will be overwhelmingly loyal to the Kremlin, after elections marked by a record low turnout threw up few surprises. With more than 93% of the votes counted on Monday morning, the United Russia party, backed by Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, and led by its prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, had won 54% of the vote. The other three parties to clear the 5% barrier required to make it into the Duma are all broadly loyal to the Kremlin line. United Russia will take more than of the 450 seats in the Duma.",
        "The Conjuring, released in the summer of 2013, was a rare beast: a retro horror exercise that performed like a blockbuster (earning well over $100m in the US) and was also beloved by critics. In essence, it was the first genre pic of its kind since The Sixth Sense to receive such adulation and fuel intense curiosity. With the inevitable sequel, returning director James Wan more or less repeats himself, but that alone is no small feat. Like its predecessor, it\u2019s exceedingly well crafted, relentlessly terrifying and boasts characters you actually root for.",
        "The fatal police shooting of an African American man by white officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, will be investigated by the US Department of Justice\u2019s civil rights division, after disturbing cellphone video of the incident emerged on Tuesday. Alton Sterling was shot dead after two officers wrestled him to the ground and appeared to open fire shortly after one officer held a gun near over Sterling\u2019s chest. The eyewitness video, which went viral shortly after it was published, prompted peaceful protests on the streets of Baton Rouge on Tuesday evening.",
        "It\u2019s unusual for Saturday Night Live to be live four weeks in a row, but it seems to have done the writers good \u2014 this week\u2019s episode was one of the strongest in recent memory. Much of this was due to the presence as host for a ninth time of Tom Hanks, an actor not just able to inhabit weird characters but with an intuitive understanding of the pace and timing of the show. Even very funny and talented people can struggle to match that. The cold open was, of course, a parody of the final presidential debate.",
        "Phew! It really was all right on the night. No \u2014 that\u2019s not fair. It was much better than all right. I\u2019ve been going back and forth to Brazil for the past five years and I was watching the opening ceremony with bated breath. Congratulations to the remarkable film director, Fernando Meirelles, probably best known for the film, City of God, set in Rio\u2019s slums. He pulled off something quite remarkable with this spectacular show, on a budget that seemed to shrink every day.",
        "The definitive moment of the \u201cnew Toronto\u201d took place, somewhat inevitably, in New York. On the TV variety show Saturday Night Live in May, Toronto\u2019s icon Drake played a gameshow contestant named Jared \u2014 a cheerful goof with dreadlocks and a red check shirt with a slight Caribbean lilt. The skit, called Black Jeopardy, was a take on the game show Jeopardy, using a series of African American cliches: uncles who wear long suits to church, the cost of hair weaves, the popularity of Tyler Perry movies, and so on.",
        "Jill Stein\u2019s attempts to secure presidential election recounts hit hurdles in Pennsylvania on Monday, while a furious Donald Trump began raising money to \u201cfight back\u201d against the efforts to review his victory. Stein was scrambling to recruit more than 25, 000 supporters to submit affidavits requesting recounts on her behalf to local elections officials in Pennsylvania, which does not allow the kind of statewide request she submitted in Wisconsin last week. The Green party candidate\u2019s team said by early afternoon that it had managed to file requests in only about 100 of Pennsylvania\u2019s 9, 163 electoral precincts.",
        "Snapchat is facing widespread backlash for a filter that promotes racist stereotypes of Asians, just months after the social media company released a Bob Marley filter that many said was the equivalent of \u201cdigital blackface\u201d. The app introduced and has since taken down a filter that allowed users to turn their selfies into Asian caricatures, prompting accusations that the feature was a clear example of \u201cyellowface\u201d.",
        "When Jim Jarmusch took the stage of the Detroit Film Theatre on Tuesday night, he sounded rather amused that his new documentary about Iggy Pop and the Stooges was about to be screened in such an ornate venue. \u201cI don\u2019t think they could\u2019ve even allowed the Stooges to be here,\u201d Jarmusch, the Ohio director known for eccentric films Stranger Than Paradise and Broken Flowers, told a crowd.",
        "In 2013, Mexico squeezed past the United States to become one of the fattest nations on the planet \u2014 with 32. 8% of the population classified as obese, according to a UN report. In response, its government announced a hefty tax on sugary drinks. Now, though, it is getting a bit more creative, and installing 30 machines at subway stations that will dispense a free ticket to anyone who completes 10 squats.",
        "Subscribe via iTunes, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Soundcloud, Acast, Stitcher, While women have been gaining rights in the past decades, workplace sexism still exists in many insidious forms. Sexism in the workplace is arguably even more difficult to navigate today because it is often subtle and difficult to pinpoint. This week, host Jessica Valenti is joined by Jessica Bennett, feature writer and columnist at the New York Times and author of Feminist Fight Club: An Office Survival Manual for a Sexist Workplace. Valenti and Bennett discuss the ways in which workplace policies still don\u2019t protect women from \u201choverers\u201d and \u201c \u201d.",
        "One poorly action can have a devastating ripple effect. So learns Mary Levov, the 16 domestic terrorist in Philip Roth\u2019s Pulitzer novel American Pastoral, and so, I fear, has Ewan McGregor, who decided an adaption of this rich, layered and elusive text would be good material for his directorial debut. McGregor directs himself as Seymour \u201cThe Swede\u201d Levov, the golden boy of 1940s Weequahic, the Jewish section of Newark, New Jersey."
