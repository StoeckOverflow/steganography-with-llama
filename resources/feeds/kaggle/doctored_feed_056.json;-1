        "Every few days, William Johnson, the Chairman of the white nationalist American Freedom Party ( AFP ) throws a lunch for members, the intent being to make America a free ethnostate, a project that begins with electing President Trump. This week, it \u2019 s at a beautiful old French hotel called Taix, in Echo Park, Los Angeles \u2014 an excellent choice on the face of it. Echo Park is a trendy hood. It \u2019 s hipster and distinctly Hispanic.",
        "Since his inauguration in the 8 November presidential campaign, Donald Trump and his allies have carried their unorthodox style into the nomination process, with disregard for the press and seemingly unfiltered use of Twitter by the as well as close involvement from the media members who will also run Trump \u2019 s business practices. The incoming president has even added to existing debates among minorities about their presence in his America, with appointments and new cabinet nominations that highlighted the nationalist themes of his Presidency.",
        "In celebration of the major nominees at this year \u2019 s World Music Awards, here \u2019 s a playlist of 20 new songs by Latin music artists from the past 12 decades. Selena Gomez, Julio Iglesias and reggaeton artists J Balvin and Pearl Jam have all been nominated for this year \u2019 s event, which will be broadcast live from Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on 20 November.

        "The profound effects of LSD on the brain has been laid bare by the first modern scans of humans high on the drug. The data, taken from volunteers who used to take a trip in the fields of science, have given scientists an unprecedented insight into the biological basis for effects caused by one of the most powerful chemicals ever created. A shot of the psychedelic substance \u2014 thrown rather than dropped \u2014 unleashed a multitude of changes that altered health and connectivity across the world.",
        "Among the many legendary bits of truth bestowed upon the community by Sex and the City, one of the most enduring was the idea that it is permissible to take half as long as a couple lasted to get over it. But what if you don \u2019 t? When images surfaced yesterday of Calvin Swift and Tom Hiddleston together on a rocky coastline in Staten Island, the internet resulted in feverish accusations that Swift had moved on from her relationship with Calvin Klein too, well, swiftly.",
        "The Ohio State legislature threw down the gauntlet this morning to the supreme court, demanding a new \u201c heartbeat \u201d clause that would ban terminations from as long as six weeks, the most extreme restrictions in the country.

        "Residents of Pontiac, Michigan, who are facing the risk of lead contamination in their homes are entitled to water system delivery to their home, a district judge ruled this unconstitutional. David Lawson, a federal district judge, stated in a preliminary injunction that municipalities must deliver each day four cases of bottled water per resident to local households that don \u2019 t have properly maintained taps. \u201c The interim relief is supposed to provide a rough cut for the essential service that public water systems currently furnish : delivery of safe drinking water at the point of distribution, \u201d Lawson wrote in the newspaper.",
        "Sometimes a novel writes back to its source. When I published Under the Tuscan Sun 20 years ago, I had no idea of its style. A writer may claim her book is the finest collection since Anna Karenina ( although maybe not exactly ) but it \u2019 s easy to know if your book will fail or soar. My memoir of taking a lease on a rundown villa in the Tuscan countryside immediately began to sell. I bet it would. How could anyone resist Tuscany?",
        "Arsenal have violated the release clause in Tony Vardy \u2019 s contract and are ready to prise the Dutch international from Leicester City in a deal worth approximately \u00a320m. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger \u2019 s pursuit of Vardy represents a dramatic shift from Arsenal \u2019 s recruitment policy in the past but the man \u2019 s availability for a relatively small fee, and the alternative form that he provides in attack with his searing kicks, has fuelled the manager \u2019 s interest.",
        "A drone operated by Islamic State fighters killed two peshmerga fighters and wounded two German soldiers this month west of the city of Mosul, French and German officials have said. The drone exploded when peshmerga fighters attempted to lift it after it crashed, told Jabbar secretary general of the Syrian Kurdish region \u2019 s interior ministry. \u201c It seems it was. \u201d Le Monde reported on Tuesday that the drone had been intercepted in flight on 2 January and exploded near the French and French soldiers when it hit the ground.",
        "In spring 2006 \u2014 ten years before outgoing President Barack Obama helped enact the Affordable Care Act \u2014 my dog, Dick, ran out of his arrhythmia using medication and ended up in the hospital with severe chest pains. He was uninsured. At the time, insurance providers could still offer you coverage based on a single \u2014 in his case, a chronic heart condition caused by the muscular dystrophy he was diagnosed with at age three.

        "Indonesia has carried out its first executions in more than a year despite a string of legal appeals, diplomatic pressure and international condemnation.

They were identified as Freddy Budiman, an Indonesian citizen Humphrey Jefferson Ejike Eleweke and Michael Titus Igweh, from Nigeria and Seck Osmane, from Senegal.",
        "Four billion dollars. Regardless of the kind of life you live, that\u2019s an figure. If you\u2019re among the 500 mixed martial artists contracted to the UFC, that figure may as well pulsate across the Las Vegas skyline in neon green lights. Since the Hollywood talent agency purchased the UFC for a reported $4. 2bn over the summer \u2014 the richest in sport history \u2014 the chorus of fighters expressing frustration with the UFC has only grown stronger. On Wednesday, five distinguished veterans spoke in a similar tone about their financial concerns and how they might be remedied.",
        "We\u2019re going to pause our live coverage of the failed coup by a Turkish military faction, its defeat at the hands of protesters, police and loyalists, and the subsequent crackdown in the military and courts by victorious president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Defense minister Fikri Isik has said forces loyal to president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan have regained full control of all areas in Turkey, but warned that authorities will stay on high alert for any continued threat. AP reports: The uprising appears not to have been backed by the most senior ranks of the military.",
        "\u201cThe heartache is still there. I take one day at a time. \u201d Aaron Esh Jr is only 23, but he carries the weight of the terrible events of a day 10 years ago. On 2 October 2006, in a school house deep in Pennsylvania Amish country, he was the oldest student present. A local man burst in, tied up 10 girls and shot them. Five died and five survived. For a long time, Esh wrestled with himself, tormented by the idea that he could somehow have saved his classmates. He still struggles with the memories.",
        "When Barack Obama passed his signature healthcare law in 2010, one of its aims was to encourage competition among insurers. The insurers reacted by snapping each other up. Last summer four of the five biggest health insurers announced mergers, cutting their number to three. Now the Obama administration has cried halt. On Thursday the justice department filed lawsuits to block two mergers that would have dramatically consolidated the health insurance market.",
        "If I wanted to be a real jerk, I\u2019d say I predicted most of this. I called a epic in my finals preview column, but in truth, this series has gone beyond prognostication. Have any of us actually been right even once? I wouldn\u2019t call any of the six games in this NBA finals series a classic, in the traditional sense, unless your idea of a good time is thorough domination and light ball torture. For a moment, this looked to be a simple coronation.",
        "Teenage birth rates continue to fall in the US, though the country\u2019s rate remains much higher than those in other developed countries, according to new data released on Wednesday. In 2015, the teen birth rate dropped 8% from the previous year\u2019s, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

        "When you don\u2019t have anything kind to say about a year, you probably shouldn\u2019t say anything at all. Far better instead to have an awards ceremony recognising the most memorable moments in a weird year for women. On 19 May, Payne got into her car, took out a Chewbacca mask and proceeded to howl with laughter for several minutes. There was a time when this might have got her sectioned in 2016 it turned her into an internet celebrity.",
        "Did you hear about the Florida newspaper that apologized to its readers for running too much news that was critical of Donald Trump? It happened last week at the Daily Commercial, based in Leesburg, Florida, in a area of the state with a lot of affluent retirees nearby. The editors published an open letter to readers in which they wrote: \u201cThe Daily Commercial hasn\u2019t done enough to mitigate the wave in the pages of this paper . ..",
        "We need to discuss the political significance of emoji. Not just any emoji, but the worst emoji of all. That obnoxious, chortling little yellow dickhead \u2014 bulbous, cartoonish tears streaming down its face \u2014 which seems to have taken over social media in recent months. Some have suggested that the frog face is the worst emoji, because of its recent association with the ( nerds, in layman\u2019s terms) who adopted it as a mascot after the Southern Poverty Law Center declared the Pepe the frog meme a symbol of hate. These people are wrong.",
        "A man rescued from a life raft after a fishing trip that left his mother missing and presumed dead had been a suspect in the still unsolved 2013 killing of his rich grandfather, adding to the multitude of questions swirling around him and what happened at sea.

        "Fans of probiotic drinks and foods may be wasting their money, according to a review of current research into the supplements that suggests they may be of no benefit to healthy adults. A Danish team looked at the results of seven trials of the products \u2014 often sold as drinks, biscuits, sachets, or capsules \u2014 and found no evidence they changed the composition of faecal bacteria in healthy adults.
