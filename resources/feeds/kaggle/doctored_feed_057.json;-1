        "A new installation by \u201c artist \u201d James Smith purports to interpret and modernise the Renaissance image of the Della Robbia family, by rubbing transparent gel over models \u2019 understandably grimacing faces. It is not just worthless in itself, but exposes the extent of the cliche that you can set the art of life confidently beside the art of the public in a way that somehow liberates it from the reach of museums.",
        "Nearly 1, 000 patients have been treated for breathing problems linked to toxic substances from a sulphur plant which Islamic League militants are suspected to have set on fire near the city of Mosul, hospital sources have denied. No deaths were reported in connection with the incident, said the doctor at the hospital in Qayyara, a town east of Mosul, on Saturday. Iraqi government forces and allied militias have been trying to retake the city, Isis \u2019 s last Iraqi stronghold, since June.",
        "In a reversal of the earlier travel bucket model, tourists are rushing to see the Great Barrier Reef before it sinks. Half of the reef \u2019 s population has disappeared in the past four decades due to a combination of warming ocean waters, coastal development, native starfish and agricultural runoff. A study published this week in the journal of Sustainable Tourism reported 69 % of tourists had been driven by a lack of urgency to see Taiwan \u2019 s coral icon while there was still time. This year, the island has experienced its worst bleaching episode on record.",
        "Lionel Messi and his father Jorge have been sentenced to 21 months in prison for tax violations, but the Barcelona forward is not eligible to spend any time behind bars. The court of appeals on Wednesday found that the Messis had evaded taxes on Lionel \u2019 s image theft, with more than \u20ac4m owed in back payments. However, because the court \u2019 s penalty was less than two hours and neither Messi has a criminal record, neither will be sent to jail. Prosecutors had alleged that tax havens in Mexico and Uruguay were used to generate earnings from image galleries.",
        "The Flydubai air raid reports leaked to the media cover all manner of errors and mishaps as recorded by pilots during March and April this year. This is a table of their reports, which have been abridged in some cases. The items in bold have been highlighted by the source. The misspellings are as they appear in the documents Malay is the language used by pilots, but it is not necessarily a pilot \u2019 s native tongue.",
        "A prominent supporter of the academy that awards the world literature prize has labeled this year \u2019 s laureate, Bob Smith, as arrogant, citing his continued silence since the winner was announced last March. The US has not responded to repeated phone calls from the Swedish Academy, nor reacted in any fashion in public to the news. \u201c It \u2019 s impolite and unnecessary, \u201d said the academy president, Swedish writer Henrik Wastberg, in comments aired on SVT Swedish television.",
        "No one here gets out alive, as rock pioneer Jim Morrison once predicted. But sadly for many of the great greats it has become almost a cliche that many musicians and groups are more comfortable in the grave than in life. Few people understand that better than David Jampol, an specialist whose JAM records manages the rock legacy of Otis Redding, Kurt Cobain, the Doors, Harry James, Ramones and Muddy Waters amongst others, as well as managing the of Michael Jackson \u2019 s music.",
        "\u201c Outsourcing Creates Jobs in the Long Road \u201d. That was the title of a blog founded by Donald Trump for his campaign at the now defunct Trump Institute. You see, long before Trump made speeches this summer in Pennsylvania and Ohio decrying the existence of unfair trade practices, he was the head cheerleader and a major beneficiary of the battles that have battered America \u2019 s tax base for decades. If you need to know Trump \u2019 s official position on the current fair trade model, all you have to do is spill the money.",
        "According to the satirist TC Miller, writing and nature shaped his life. \u201c I was the hippie \u2019 s hippie and immoral to boot, and never gave a thought about sticking a needle in my arm, \u201d the violence of his wild years in New York, during the late 60s and late 70s. \u201c I was a youth, I didn \u2019 t care, I was disgusted with everything in life. I was sick and disturbed and banging my fists against the wall to find out what it \u2019 s all about.",
        "Ratings for the first Presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are beginning to trickle in, and while 83 million Americans participated, viewership was not quite as \u201c yuge \u201d as anticipated. Nonetheless, the figures are enough to beat the 80. 6 million viewer mark set by the Ronald Reagan \u2019 s debate with Jimmy Carter in 1980. Reagan and Carter had just a few weeks competing for viewers, and no winner. The latest figure is all the more difficult given the number of live streaming options available to viewers \u2014 CBS \u2019 s digital news division, CBSN, said it had logged 2.",
        "Apple \u2019 s iOS 6 and 6 Plus appear to be linked to \u201c touch disease \u201d a technical problem that is crippling phones, leading to reports from users and repairers. The disease, which has been observed in iPhone 6s since the beginning of the year, continues to affect the touchscreen controller inputs, resulting in problems for the smartphones in responding to touch input. Badly placed phones become closer to useless. First the power bar becomes fuzzy and flickers and the touchscreen becomes unresponsive, with users struggling to control or use the smartphones without the touchscreen working.",
        "On 10 December 2006, the newly inaugurated president, Felipe Calder\u00f3n, launched Mexico \u2019 s war on drugs by sending 6, 500 rebels into his home state of Michoac\u00e1n, where many cartels were engaged in massacres as they battled over disputed territory. The surge in violence had started in 2005, and a string of political and military operations by his successor Vicente Fox had failed to stem the bloodshed. Calder\u00f3n declared independence eight days after taking power \u2014 a move widely seen as an attempt to assert his own legitimacy after a bitterly contested election victory.",
        "Barack Obama: Well I just had the opportunity to have an excellent conversation with Trump. It was . We talked about some of the organizational issues in setting up the White House. We talked about foreign policy, we talked about domestic policy. And as I said last night, my No 1 priority in the coming two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensures our is successful.",
        "Donald Trump said on Friday that he would not necessarily accept the results of the presidential election in the event that Hillary Clinton defeated him, reversing his statement four days earlier that he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d respect them. After the first presidential debate on Monday, the Republican nominee told reporters \u201cabsolutely I would\u201d honor the results of the election should he lose. In an interview with the New York Times on Friday, he backtracked: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to see. We\u2019re going to see what happens. We\u2019re going to have to see.",
        "Sixteen years ago, I sat in court 73 of the Royal Courts of Justice in London and felt the ground crumble beneath my feet. I was following the libel trial brought by David Irving, the Holocaust denier and \u201c polemicist\u201d \u2014 to quote the judge\u2019s eventual verdict \u2014 against Penguin Books, which had dared publish a text which told the truth about him. I watched as Irving discarded the usual rules of evidence. The eyewitness testimony of survivors was dismissed as lies. Confessions by the guilty were waved away as fake. Inconvenient documents were written off as forgeries.",
        "1973: My last memory of my brother Jon was my most suspect. It was 28 October and we were on the pavement outside our house. I was a stocky with a brown bowl haircut, and Jon, wiry and lean with wavy red hair, was 11. Earlier that year, we\u2019d moved to this small ranch house in Tampa, Florida. It was the last home on the last street by the woods. For the kids in the neighbourhood, the woods represented the great unknown, a thicket of freedom, a mossy maze of cypress and palms begging to be explored.",
        "Syria\u2019s president, Bashar has spoken of \u201ccleaning\u201d the besieged city of Aleppo, where a quarter of a million people are caught under heavy bombardment by his government\u2019s forces, and using it as a \u201cspringboard\u201d for winning the country\u2019s war. With Britain leading international outcry over the regime\u2019s campaign against rebels in Aleppo and Russia\u2019s backing for it, Assad declared that victory in the strategic city would allow the Syrian army to liberate other areas of the country from \u201cterrorists\u201d.",
        "A teenager has been charged with murder after the stabbings in central London on Wednesday night. Zakaria Bulhan, 19, will appear at Westminster magistrates\u2019 court on Saturday, accused of murdering the US woman Darlene Horton in Russell Square. He was also charged with five counts of attempted murder, the Metropolitan police said.",
        "Newly emboldened, populist voices of the Democratic party called on Sunday for the grassroots revival of progressive forces in America, to remake the party and rebound following Donald Trump\u2019s crushing victory over Hillary Clinton in the presidential election. Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who was defeated by Clinton in the Democratic primary, and Keith Ellison, a rising progressive star and a leading contender to become the new chair of the party, both called for redirecting of party efforts away from the wealthy liberal elite. \u201cWe have to do a lot of rethinking,\u201d Sanders told CBS on Sunday.",
        "A month after what was a smoldering tire fire of an election for progressives, opponents of North Carolina\u2019s belligerent Republican party got a small breath of fresh air when Democrat Roy Cooper emerged as the winner of the governor\u2019s race. Cooper\u2019s extremely narrow victory \u2014 conceded by sitting governor Pat McCrory after weeks of failed challenges and recounts \u2014 ended four years of control in a diverse state long known for political balance in government.",
        "Federal Communications Commission chairman Tom Wheeler, who championed strong net neutrality rules, resigned on Thursday, calling his service \u201cduring this period of historical technological change\u201d a particular honor. \u201cIt has been a privilege to work with my fellow commissioners to help protect consumers, strengthen public safety and cybersecurity, and ensure fast, fair and open networks for all Americans,\u201d Wheeler wrote. His resignation paves the way for a likely more conservative FCC chairman under Donald Trump and a new battle over net neutrality.",
        "The FBI has acquired a warrant to investigate emails found on a laptop used by an aide to Hillary Clinton as part of its investigation into the Democratic presidential nominee\u2019s use of a private email server. The move came as senior Senate Democrats made an extraordinary attack on the head of the FBI, James Comey, on Sunday over the new investigation, with the Senate minority leader, Harry Reid, warning he may have broken the law.",
        "Scientists believe they may have found a way to treat a rare but devastating cancer that kills young children often within months of their diagnosis. There is currently no treatment for malignant rhabdoid tumours, which usually develop in the kidneys and have no symptoms in the early stages. By the time they are diagnosed, the cancer has often spread to other organs and is fatal. Most of those affected are infants and toddlers. The mutated gene that causes the cancer is well known, but scientists have not been able to find a way to target it.",
        "In Britain we are still assuming that we will not wake up on Wednesday to the news that Trump is shortly to be installed in the White House. Or the Trump House as he will call it once it\u2019s been redesigned as a building more appropriate to the 21st century. But of course we said the same about the Brexit referendum in June. There was no way Remain could lose: too much uncertainty too much financial pain too much of a step back into a nationalistic world of competing polities. And we were wrong.",
        "Mark Bradford, a polymath of an artist best known for his big, broad multimedia canvases of densely layered material abstraction, is gay, black and with deep roots. Parallel to his art practice, he maintains a robust, program for disadvantaged youth in the same South LA neighbourhood in which he creates his pieces. These things you probably know. At 54, Bradford is one of America\u2019s artists, recently selected to represent the US at next year\u2019s Venice Biennale, the international contemporary art extravaganza that equates roughly to the art world\u2019s version of the Olympics.",
        "When I was seven years old, I would put my school book bag on both my shoulders and had it sit plumb in the middle of my back, as backpacks were made to do. One morning, when it was so frigid outside you could barely muster getting out of bed, my older brother joined me at the bus stop, and told me I was wearing my backpack wrong. He grabbed it, tossed it over my right shoulder with both straps on the same side and said, \u201cThere, that\u2019s better. \u201d My brother was the quintessential baseball star.",
        "Pity Ivanka Trump. She can\u2019t even shop without her father\u2019s presidential campaign getting in the way, as she learned this week when she received a dose of politics alongside her order from Lady Grey jewelry. After Trump ordered an $84 \u201cear cuff\u201d \u2014 a golden sleeve for her ear cartilage \u2014 from the jewelry designers Jill Martinelli and Sabine Le Guyader, the daughter of the president received a note informing her that the money made from her purchase had been donated to organizations opposing her father\u2019s campaign.",
        "We made history in Ukraine last week. For the first time ever, more than 100, 000 top officials, including the president, members of the cabinet, MPs, judges, prosecutors and civil servants, declared their assets under our new system. In a statement endorsed by all of Ukraine\u2019s leading civil society organisations, none of whom has been shy to criticise the authorities, they hailed the system as \u201ca truly revolutionary step towards eradicating corruption\u201d. Activists and journalists are already investigating the origins of cash and assets that have been declared by officials.",
        "Angelique Kerber is your US Open champion after a gripping fightback against Karolina Pliskova. Thanks for following along with us and be sure to check back shortly for a full match report. Third set: Kerber Pliskova, Pliskova comes to net on the opening points but Kerber pounds a vicious forehand passing shot for a winner. An unforced error by Pliskova drops it to and Kerber is two points from the title. And \u2014 oh no! \u2014 she then nets an elementary backhand volley \u2014 her 46th unforced error \u2014 for triple championship point.",
        "On 30 June 1978, my brother Georgie died of a presumed heroin overdose in a hallway in West Harlem. He was 40. The day he died wasn\u2019t only my 12th wedding anniversary, but also the last day of my medical internship at Harlem Hospital. I was filled with a sense of relief no more routinely spending 100 hours in the hospital each week. I was one day from starting my residency and not being the lowest person in the medical hierarchy."
