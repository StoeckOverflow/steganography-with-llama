        "Since that exhilarating win over Manchester City, Chelsea have gone six days without a win and their win in Wednesday \u2019 s defeat by Bayer Leverkusen at home amounted to a bottle job of proportions, with several of the same culprits plus some character masquerading as a \u00a330m midfielder. The first London derby provides a chance for rapid redemption but if two players cannot move their heads sufficiently far to pass to each other and track runners, at least, then Mauricio Pochettino \u2019 s embarrassment is about to go an awful lot worse.",
        "The Canadian government will be heading to the coast of British Columbia to investigate evidence that a diver may have fallen across \u201c the lost nuke \u201d \u2014 a Mark IV bomb that went missing after an American rocket crashed in the region during the Vietnam war. Diver Sean Smyrichinsky was picking up a day of diving around Haida Gwaii, an archipelago 80km west of the border of British Columbia, when he stumbled across what may be the location of the world \u2019 s first known \u201c broken arrow \u201d \u2014 the collective name for accidents involving American nuclear submarines.",
        "Fidel Castro appeared as divisive in death as he was in life, with friends and admirers agreed only on his place in the record books, as a towering genius who transformed a small Mediterranean island into a major leader in world affairs. Mourning and rebellion began together, long after his brother and successor Manuel Ra\u00fal announced that old wounds and illness had finally achieved what the CIA could not accomplish in hundreds of assassination attempts, and carried the Cuban President away. The news was carried on Cuban state television in the early hours of early morning.",
        "A gigantic overhaul of the world \u2019 s buildings, mass transport and energy sources costing trillions of dollars is necessary if dangerous climate change is to be avoided, according to a recent new report. The report by the Global Commission on the Earth and Climate, which is by prominent British economist Lord Frederick Stern, found that the US is expected to invest about $ 90tn in infrastructure over the next 15 years, reflecting an \u201c urgent \u201d shift to show that this money is spent on infrastructure.",
        "There is a questionnaire, the Psychopathy Scale, which assesses psychopathic tendencies in the general population. There are many, and the respondent indicates the extent to which each factor applies to them, from \u201c strongly disagreed \u201d to \u201c strongly disagree \u201d. Earlier in my PhD, a friend asked if he could see the questionnaire. He laid out one of the items : \u2018 I could tell people what they wish to hear. \u2019 He looked thoughtful. \u2018 But I would agree with that \u2014 I do that right, \u2019 he said.",
        "\u201c Speaking of shills, if she stays in Texas she probably wants grants from the oil company. \u201d This is one of the more polite social media missiles Katharine Hayhoe has had coming at her this week. But it \u2019 s hopelessly misguided. Hayhoe is a climate engineer. And she \u2019 s on a mission to persuade skeptics that bacteria are frying the planet and time is running out to stop it. The last place she would take money from is Big Oil.",
        "When most of us respond to intoxicants during a major breakup, we eventually wake up with a smashed smartphone picture of a reduced number of Twitter followers and a restraining order. It caused the rarefied vision of Spiritualized \u2019 s Jason Turner to emerge clutching two of the most dazzling works of desolation ever written.",
        "The horrors of a haunted city usually end once you see open the final panel of black, doors and walls back in the fairground. However, the conceptual artist Pedro Pablo hopes his nightmares continue with visitors long after they have created his immersive 2016 Halloween attraction, also in New York one month. \u201c Monsters have always been a way to speak about our deepest fears, \u201d says the.",
        "\u201c We draw first, we miss penalties tonight, today we win together, \u201d said the banner carried up in the stands here before. Even as he evolves into more and more of a fighter, such thinking is anathema to Cristiano Ronaldo. On Wednesday, he reversed his habitual position for Portugal of bearing the load when others cannot, ensuring his jittery team did the honors by scraping a thrilling draw against Bernd Storck \u2019 s favored Hungary. So it is the Hungarians, the outsiders, who dominate Group F, and deservedly so, after a mercurial week befitting the suddenly scorching heat in Europe.",
        "The 284 kids participating in this year \u2019 s Scripps National Spelling Bee got their first chance to approach the microphone on Wednesday \u2014 and to hear the dreaded bell that announces an incorrect spelling. At the time of Wednesday \u2019 s onstage show, the field will be cut to no more than 50 spellers for Tuesday \u2019 s finals. Here are some highlights from the semifinal rounds, which featured more new words than in past seasons \u2014 a trend that will continue into Tuesday \u2019 s finals.",
        "Andrew Luck, the Indianapolis Colts \u2019 quarterback, has signed a contract extending through 2021, which, reports suggest, will make him the player in the NFL. \u201c I am proud and excited to continue with this big organization, \u201d Luck stated in a statement. \u201c I am thankful to the Irsay Brothers and Mr [ Jim ] Irsay for presenting me with this great opportunity and the courage that they \u2019 ve shown in me.

        "As a parent, I have done something hypocritical and illegal. Not that the adults know \u2026 yet, and not for a long time. If ever. It ends with the dentist yanking at a back tooth he feels must come out. Except that half of it cracks pretty loudly. I feel fine after six injections. The dentist mutters and frowns. I smell salt on his breath as he taps what \u2019 s left of my teeth and says : \u201c Damn. I can \u2019 t get it all out. It \u2019 s like a limpet in there. You \u2019 ll have to go to the hospital tomorrow.",
        "On the evening of 11 August 2014, Assam Dara Ali was at home in Jalawla, southern Iraq. His wife, Teba, was putting their two young children to bed meanwhile, Kurdish officials in Erbil were beginning to report that Jalawla had fallen to Isis. \u201cSuddenly we heard cries of \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019 God is greatest, from the mosque,\u201d Assam tells me. Isis was broadcasting its takeover message from the minarets, visible from the family\u2019s courtyard.",
        "The victims of the devastating fire that killed 36 people in Oakland, California, were artists, musicians, activists, community organizers and other young people who came together for a party at the \u201cGhost Ship\u201d warehouse on Friday night. The fire, the deadliest in Oakland\u2019s history, sent shockwaves through the vibrant underground scene in the northern California city, which is a haven for experimental art and music. \u201cThis is a mass loss. It\u2019s reverberating throughout the entire community,\u201d said Sarah Carlberg, assistant director of the Bay Area Book Festival, who knew many at the party.",
        "That\u2019s all from me, thanks for reading. You can read David Hytner\u2019s match report from Craven Cottage here: The Fulham captain Tom Cairney admits that Newcastle should have had a penalty in the first half when Ryan Tunnicliffe blocked a Matt Ritchie cross with his arm, and that will surely be what Rafa Ben\u00edtez reflects on after the game. Newcastle will feel hard done by, but at the same time they didn\u2019t create enough clear chances to win the game. A brilliant boost for Fulham to pick up all three points.",
        "People who diagnose their own illnesses by trawling the internet or talking to friends risk damaging their health, pharmacists have warned. The growing trend of DIY diagnosis could lead to patients receiving the wrong treatment or buying drugs that could harm them, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS) said. \u201cDIY diagnosis can be downright dangerous. You could be missing something a pharmacist or doctor would know was important. While there are good online sites, there\u2019s an awful lot of nonsense out there too,\u201d said Neal Patel, head of corporate communications at the society.",
        "Thelma Baxter defines herself first and foremost as a Harlem girl. \u201cBeing a Harlem girl means that I consider that I have swag.

        "Dak Prescott threw three touchdown passes, two to Dez Bryant, in the first game with Tony Romo as his backup, and the Dallas Cowboys set a franchise season record with their ninth straight win, beating the Baltimore Ravens . The Cowboys ( ) punted on their first four possessions \u2014 a first this season \u2014 against the NFL\u2019s No1 defense.

The former Smiths frontman has penned a letter to General Motors\u2019 chair and CEO, Mary Barra, asking the automaker to consider adding the option of vegan leather to its interiors. \u201cGiven that the Volt and Bolt are being marketed to buyers, entirely vegan options would only broaden their appeal,\u201d the wrote.",
        "Prosecutors will charge seven current and former San Francisco Bay Area police officers in a sexual misconduct scandal involving a teenager. Alameda County district attorney Nancy O\u2019Malley said she was waiting to formally file charges until the teen could be returned to California from Florida, where she has been jailed in an assault case.

        "Millions of eyes will be on President Hillary Clinton, should she win November\u2019s election. Millions more eyes are just as likely to be focused on the charismatic and popular politician standing next to her, the \u201cfirst gentleman\u201d William Jefferson Clinton. Bill Clinton has already joked that he would like to \u201cbreak the stranglehold that women have had on the job of presidential spouse\u201d. Whether that statement contains some ambivalence or unintended irony may become more evident upon considering all that he brings to that groundbreaking role. He will be the very first first gentleman of the United States.",
        "Vladimir Putin spoke with the US Donald Trump, for the first time on Monday, with the Russian president keen to emphasise the potential for bilateral cooperation. While many world leaders watched the US election result with confusion and horror, Russia hopes a Trump presidency will mean less lecturing from the west and a freer hand to act as it pleases in Ukraine and Syria.",
        "Theresa May appeals to a stereotype that has a deep grip on the English psyche. Sober and commonsensical, she behaves with the moral seriousness we expect from a vicar\u2019s daughter. She may be a little clunky, but what a relief it is to have a straightforward leader from the heart of the country after the flash, phonies of the past. I am not saying her public image is all a pretence. No focus group told her to campaign against the modern slave trade when she was home secretary.",

A later she\u2019s crashing to the ground (shouting expletives all the way) but just as quickly she\u2019s up again with an indefatigable sparkle in her eye, a mix between a soldier and an eager puppy.
