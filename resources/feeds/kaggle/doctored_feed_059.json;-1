        "Brazil \u2019 s Brazilian supreme court has affirmed a judge \u2019 s ruling requiring mobile phone services to indefinitely block access to Facebook \u2019 s WhatsApp \u2014 the third such ruling against the popular phone messaging services in eight months. The Rio de Janeiro Judge Daniela Barbosa ruled that access to the site should be blocked immediately because WhatsApp \u2019 s website, Facebook, had shown \u201c widespread disrespect for Brazilian laws \u201d. Her court said Facebook was also asked to intercept calls sent through the service to help in a criminal investigation in the municipality of Caxias, outside Rio.",
        "It \u2019 s quite sad to say that I got to watch Leonard Cohen singing as a person rather than an actor. I didn \u2019 t get into his music as a kid \u2014 I was an opera fanatic from 13 \u2014 but my sister Anne did, so there we were, embarking on very dramatic voyages in terms of the songs that we liked, with Cohen just being this strange voice to me through the wall. Suddenly I knew who he was, as he was a god in Hell, where my family are from.",
        "They wasted a lot of time this season, but hey, the Seattle Sounders are making up for it. Portland \u2019 s Cascadia Cup win over the Portland Timbers means that since replacing Sigi Schmid the CenturyLink Field side have lost one and won three of their five league matches, taking them into contention in the West. A team that looked to have settled into a decline just a few weeks back is now a possibility. Seattle haven \u2019 t just lit the fuse, they \u2019 ve created a raging furnace.",
        "The CIA \u2019 s claim that Russia covertly intervened to suppress last month \u2019 s US election in favour of President Trump but its actions did not compromise the overall credibility of the claims in doubt will be hard to see for some. The classified CIA material, which has not been published, may also have implications for the integrity of Russia \u2019 s Brexit referendum last March, and how upcoming elections in Austria and Germany could be susceptible to Russian manipulation. The latest revelations are not entirely new. What is unique is the bald assertion that Russia was working for Trump.",
        "After 30 days, 50 hours, 107 goals, 5, 000 kilometres run and several distinct episodes of inertia and intrigue, Euro 2016 has its final. It is the fourth final too. If Didier Deschamps \u2019 team could get there, France against everything else always finds the right way to make these warily embraced events staged by a willing if world weary host, a team still in a state of medical emergency after a bloody and fretful day. The cracks have showed at times, but not often and less so with every passing round.",
        "When Michelle Bush told the Democratic candidate \u201c I wake up every day in a house that was built by someone \u201d the backlash was as immediate and swift. Some thought enslaved blacks \u2014 our African ancestors \u2014 built the White House or accused blacks of exaggerating. Others expressed suspicion that the first lady took up slavery at all. Fox Political talk show host Bill O \u2019 Reilly takes a kinder approach : he acknowledged this shameful comment, but with a twist of the knife.",
        "It travelled around a billion kilometres across the solar system, maintained its parachute flawlessly and survived a scorching blast through the Martian atmosphere, but the European Space Agency ( ESA ) has noted that its ExoMars lander was lost just one minute before it touched down on the surface of the outer planet. The Schiaparelli Mars lander displayed the first signs of a glitch as it lost its parachute 1km from the surface and the rocket went dead shortly afterwards, ESA scientists vanished on Thursday, leaving them uncertain of where the probe is and whether it.",
        "The confirmed shipwreck in the Great Lakes, an sloop that sank in Lake Ontario more than 200 years ago, has been found, a team of two explorers said today. The western New Republic said it discovered the shipwreck this time in deep water off Oswego, in western New York. Information captured by a remotely controlled vehicle confirmed it is the Mississippi, which sank during a storm in 1803, expedition member Jim Kennard explained. \u201c This one is very special.",
        "It would be hard to make a case for the boilersuit \u2014 from Ghostbusters to the hordes of Glastonbury \u2014 as the best of the decade. At New York fashion week on Sunday evening, there was more fuel to the mood : the finale of the DKNY show showed about 40 models in boiler gear. Case closed. This was the first show for DKNY since it was bought by production company for nearly \u00a3500m in July. And, judging by the event ( New York \u2019 s biggest tourist attraction, the Green Line ) the 9pm start and death row, change was in the balance.",
        "The FBI is investigating the attack on Yahoo that caused at least 1bn user calls, the White House reported on Thursday. Speaking to Google at the daily White House press briefing on Thursday, President Josh Earnest said he would not comment on the scope of technology that may have been compromised in the hack, the first data breach in history, which Yahoo believes was. \u201c What I can say is that the FBI is investigating this matter, \u201d Earnest said.",
        "The Berlin lorry raid on Monday that killed 12 people and injured 48 others raised a pressing question for transport services across the country : what can be done to stop such attacks? The attack on Berlin \u2019 s black market came two months after a cargo train was deliberately driven into Berlin celebrating Bastille Day in Paris, killing 86 people and injuring 484. This seemingly new \u2014 and highly destructive \u2014 form of terrorist attack is quickly becoming one that security forces fear the most : it can cause untold carnage and may come out of nowhere.",
        "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho claimed his Manchester United team were the unluckiest in the Premier League after a third home draw in a row and should by rights be occupying a top four position. The United manager also contended Arsenal\u2019s late equaliser in the lunchtime draw at Old Trafford might have been prevented had Marouane Fellaini been available to help out in defence. \u201cWhen the cross came in we didn\u2019t have enough tall, strong players in the box to deal with it,\u201d he said.",
        "Fresh evidence is emerging that refugees stranded in camps across Greece are falling victim to rising levels of vice peddled by mafia gangs who see the entrapped migrants as perfect prey for prostitution, drug trafficking and human smuggling. Details of the alarming conditions present in many of the facilities comes as the Greek government \u2014 facing criticism after the Observer\u2019s expos\u00e9 of sexual abuse in camps last week \u2014 announced urgent measures to deal with the crisis.",
        "Derrick Rose testified on Tuesday that he had a hunch his was going to claim he raped her after he and two friends had sex with her. The NBA star said in court that he became suspicious when the woman later texted on the day of the alleged assault to describe burns she claimed she got on her hands from a fire pit outside his Beverly Hills, California, house. The New York Knicks player said he never saw the woman burn herself, and he had an inkling he was being set up.",
        "When the US women\u2019s soccer team rose to fame in the late 1990s, they projected an image that was a composite of fun, friendship and teamwork in the pursuit of excellence. Two new memoirs, Carli Lloyd\u2019s When Nobody Was Watching and Abby Wambach\u2019s Forward, shatter that perception. But they do so in a way that should open a more realistic discussion on what we expect from athletes, especially but not limited to female athletes, and what they should expect from themselves.",
        "On the afternoon after the final episode of The Nightly Show, Larry Wilmore said he was ready to figure out what\u2019s next. \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough few days getting through the shows,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now that it\u2019s over, it\u2019s like: \u2018OK, let\u2019s move on. \u2019\u201d Comedy Central announced the show\u2019s cancellation earlier this week, and Wilmore said the next few days could only be described as \u201csurreal\u201d. Those days dragged by, he said, but the level of support from fans and the media also surprised him: their messages were uplifting, despite a sadness that followed.",

        "Mexican authorities are investigating reports of a tiger sighting nine months after another Bengal tiger escaped into a mangrove forest in another part of the country and was never recaptured.

        "Studying at New York University has become so prohibitively expensive that the historic Manhattan school is introducing a scheme to help students save money by lodging in elderly people\u2019s spare bedrooms. Andrew Hamilton, NYU\u2019s new president, has approved a pilot scheme to pair up students with older people struggling to make ends meet.",
        "The families of those lost aboard a Malaysia Airlines flight that went missing in 2014 will themselves comb the beaches of Madagascar this week in the hope of finding debris from the plane. The families, who arrived on the island in the Indian Ocean on Saturday, have criticised Malaysian investigators for not doing enough to find debris, which could reveal more clues about what happened. Flight MH370, carrying 239 passengers and crew, disappeared on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on 8 March 2014, sparking a search in the southern Indian Ocean that is still going on.",
        "The supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg executed a full on Thursday morning, over remarks about the presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump that ignited controversy on the eve of the GOP convention. Her remarks about Trump were \u201c \u201d she said, adding: \u201cI regret making them. \u201d In an interview with the New York Times last week, Ginsburg said she could not \u201cimagine what the country would be with Donald Trump as our president\u201d and suggested her late husband would have taken such a scenario as a reason to emigrate \u2014 as far away as New Zealand.",
        "Nature could hardly have been kinder to us. The discovery of a potentially habitable planet on our astronomical doorstep is nothing short of astronomers\u2019 wildest dreams coming true. In a world where discoveries seem to be coming thick and fast (think water on Mars, gravitational waves, Higgs boson) it is vitally important that we now focus our efforts on learning all we can about this tantalising world because of its potential to tell us something about life elsewhere in the universe. Proxima Centauri b is about 1. 3 times the mass of the Earth. Its year lasts just 11.",
        "As Andy Murray headed for the champion\u2019s dinner at the Guildhall for the second time, three years after his first, he finally had time to properly savour the unique joy of owning not only the Wimbledon title, but the love of a nation, as well as his family. With his wife, Kim, by his side, and his mother and father not far behind, Murray might also have spared a thought en route for his brother, Jamie, who had flown to Belgrade earlier with the Great Britain Davis Cup team in preparation for the against Serbia later in the week.",
        "Mose Allison, the influential jazz and blues pianist and singer, died on 15 November aged 89. The artist, whose hybrid southern style won him fans across the world for over six decades, died of natural causes, his wife, Audre Allison, confirmed. Allison grew up in the Mississippi Delta region of the States, and his music draws on jazz and the blues he was surrounded by in those formative years, along with with a dash of country. Overall, however, his sound was triumphantly difficult to define.",
        "Autumn leaves colour the wooded hills along Ohio\u2019s State Route 82 and the blue signs promoting presidential candidates along the verge pop against the scarlet and lemon foliage. Some pollsters have Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in a statistical tie in Ohio but the signs in this corner of the state suggest this is Trump country. Once a Democratic stronghold in a state that can make or break a presidential bid, Mahoning County, which encompasses the city of Youngstown and its environs, is lagging behind in the economic recovery.",
        "A professional US poker player has lost his appeal against a London casino over winnings of \u00a37. 7m due to his use of \u201c \u201d a gambling technique that involves exploiting design irregularities on the backs of cards.

        "North Dakota governor Jack Dalrymple ordered the immediate evacuation of the main encampment of activists opposing the Dakota Access pipeline, but a state official said he would not authorize law enforcement officials to carry out the order.

        "Pink Floyd bassist Roger Waters is due at Marc Maron\u2019s studio soon, and despite the fact that Maron grew up listening to Pink Floyd\u2019s albums, he\u2019s not anxious about the forthcoming interview. After you\u2019ve hosted the president of the United States in your garage, it\u2019s hard to be nervous about much else. Back in July 2015, as secret service officers patrolled the streets outside of Maron\u2019s Highland Park home, Barack Obama joined Maron on his WTF podcast for a discussion about race relations, fatherhood, gun violence, and overcoming fear.",
