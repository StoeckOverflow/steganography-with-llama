        "U. S. President Donald Trump will discuss how to rein in North Korea\u2019s nuclear program with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this week in what a senior White House official said on Tuesday would be a test for the U. S. relationship. Trump and Xi are to meet on Thursday and Friday at Trump\u2019s retreat on the Atlantic coast in Palm Beach, Florida. It will be their first meeting since Trump took office on Jan. 20, and trade and security issues are to figure prominently in their talks.",
        "U. S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday condemned a Syrian chemical weapons attack that killed dozens and blamed Syrian President Bashar but did not say how he would respond despite calls from France for stronger U. S. leadership. Trump said the attack in Syria\u2019s Idlib province was \u201dreprehensible and cannot be ignored by the civilized world,\u201d although he also sought to blame his predecessor, Barack Obama. \u201dThese heinous actions by the Bashar regime are a consequence of the last administration\u2019s weakness and irresolution,\u201d Trump said in a statement.",
        "The United Nations Security Council will be briefed on Wednesday, at the request of Britain and France, on a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria that killed dozens of people, including 11 children, in the northwestern province of Idlib. France, the United States and Britain blamed Syrian President Bashar \u2019s forces for the attack on Tuesday. The Syrian military denied responsibility and said it would never use chemical weapons. \u201dWe obviously are very concerned about what happened with the Syrian chemical weapon attack so we\u2019ll be having an emergency meeting tomorrow morning in the open chamber,\u201d U. S.",
        "Islamist militants have targeted Russia many times before but Monday\u2019s bombing of a metro train in St Petersburg was, for President Vladimir Putin, personal: it happened in his native city on a day he was making a visit back home. The attack, which killed 14 people and wounded 50, is also a test for one of Putin\u2019s most contentious policies his decision to launch a military intervention in Syria on the side of President Bashar .",
        "The main suspect in a suicide bombing on the St Petersburg metro that killed 14 people had rented an apartment in the city a month before the blast, neighbors and a building maintenance worker told Reuters on Wednesday. A day after Monday\u2019s attack, security officials raided the apartment and ordered other residents to leave a precaution often undertaken when police believe there may be explosives or equipment inside.",
        "Akbarzhon Jalilov, the man suspected of blowing up a Russian metro train, represents a new wave of radical Islamists who blend into local society away from existing jihadist movements making it harder for security forces to stop their attacks. His pages on the Russian equivalent of Facebook show Jalilov\u2019s interest in Wahabbism, a conservative and hardline branch of Islam. But they give no indication that he might resort to violence, presenting a picture of a typical young man leading a largely secular life.",
        "Some Iraqis in this town get massages in a spa or take muddy baths and relax in the morning sun on the banks of the Tigris. Others beg for food or rise at dawn to queue for water. Hammam a town south of Mosul once famous throughout Iraq for its healing hot waters, is back in business after a U. S. offensive retook the area from Islamic State militants and authorities reopened its spa.",
        "A majority of Americans are unwilling to share their personal emails, text messages, phone calls and records of online activity with U. S. investigators even to help foil terror plots, according to a opinion poll released on Tuesday. The poll showed Americans were more reluctant to share personal information than when the poll last asked the question four years ago. For instance, 75 percent of adults said they would not let investigators tap into their Internet activity to help the U. S. combat domestic terrorism. That\u2019s up from 67 percent who answered the same way in June 2013.",
        "A U. S. House of Representatives vote to overhaul Obamacare before lawmakers leave Washington for a break looked unlikely late on Tuesday as top White House deputies and key Republican groups said more discussions were needed. Vice President Mike Pence and administration officials met on Capitol Hill for two hours with lawmakers from the moderate \u201dTuesday Group,\u201d the conservative Republican Study Committee, and the House Freedom Caucus, the rebel group of conservative lawmakers that derailed the first healthcare bill last month.",
        "Since arriving at Saturn in July 2004, Cassini has been exploring the giant planet and its entourage of 62 known moons, including enigmatic Titan, believed by scientists to resemble an early Earth, and the moon Enceladus, which is shooting ice particles out into space. To avoid any chance that hitchhiking Earth microbes still alive on Cassini could contaminate any potential living organisms on Enceladus, NASA plans to crash the spacecraft, which is running out of fuel, into Saturn on Sept. 15. But before its demise, Cassini has one last mission.",
        "Investors also focused on a potentially tense meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping set for the end of the week. Retail stocks swooned after downgrades and a Ralph Lauren ( ) announcement it was shutting its flagship Fifth Avenue store in New York and cutting jobs. \u201dWe\u2019re sitting on the sidelines waiting for earnings to begin in earnest next week,\u201d said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst, Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.

        "President Donald Trump vowed on Tuesday to cut red tape to speed up approval of infrastructure projects and said his overhaul could top $1 trillion on roads, tunnels and bridges, one of his 2016 election campaign promises. Trump, a real estate businessman before he was elected, did not provide further details on the amount or where the money would come from when he spoke to a White House meeting of 50 chief executives and other business leaders. U. S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said at the forum that the administration plans to release a legislative package in May.",
        "The U. S. trade deficit fell from a near two year high in February as slowing domestic demand weighed on imports and stronger global growth boosted exports of American goods. The politically sensitive trade gap with China narrowed sharply by 26. 6 percent from January to $23 billion ahead of a summit between President Donald Trump and China\u2019s Xi Jinping this week, although seasonal factors were likely behind the dramatic drop, economists said. The Commerce Department said on Tuesday the trade deficit declined 9. 6 percent to $43.",
        "The Federal Reserve\u2019s top regulator, about to step down after a career defending tough restrictions on big banks, on Tuesday conceded during his last speech as a U. S. central banker that he now believes some rules adopted after the financial crisis have proven too complicated and should be adjusted. Daniel Tarullo, a Fed governor since the depths of the crisis in early 2009, said the existing Volcker rule has proven unworkable and that annual \u201dstress tests\u201d of the top Wall Street banks may not need a qualitative review as they do now.",
        "An Uber executive at the center of a legal dispute with Alphabet Inc\u2019s Waymo unit has \u201dno basis to believe\u201d any criminal investigation is underway over allegations of trade secret theft, the executive\u2019s lawyer said in a court filing. Waymo sued ride services company Uber Technologies Inc earlier this year, alleging that a former Waymo executive, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded over 14, 000 confidential documents before leaving the company to subsequently join Uber. Waymo said Uber benefited from those documents.",

The pact between the world\u2019s largest maker of premium cars and the world\u2019s largest automotive supplier forms a powerful counterweight to new auto industry players like firms Uber and Didi which are also working on cars. Technology companies and carmakers are striving to adjust to a shifting landscape in the auto industry as consumers increasingly use smartphones to locate, hail and rent vehicles, rather than going out and buying cars.",
        "The Trump administration would virtually eliminate federal funding for the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s budget for vehicle emissions and fuel economy testing but will seek to raise fees on industry to pay for some testing, a government document shows. The cuts would slash by more than half the staff of the EPA department that conducts vehicle, engine, and fuel testing to verify emissions standards are met and mileage stickers are accurate. Its work helped lead to Volkswagen AG\u2019s ( ) 2015 admission that it violated vehicle emissions rules for years.",
        "Some big American coal companies have advised President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to break his promise to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement \u2014 arguing that the accord could provide their best forum for protecting their global interests. Remaining in the global deal to combat climate change will give U. S. negotiators a chance to advocate for coal in the future of the global energy mix, coal companies like Cloud Peak Energy Inc and Peabody Energy Corp told White House officials over the past few weeks, according to executives and a U. S.",
        "The China National Chemical Corp, or ChemChina, has won U. S. antitrust approval to buy Switzerland\u2019s Syngenta AG on condition that it divest three products, the Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday. The $43 billion deal, which was announced in February 2016, was prompted by China\u2019s desire to use Syngenta\u2019s portfolio of chemicals and seeds to improve domestic agricultural output. To win approval from U. S. antitrust enforcers, the companies agreed to divest ChemChina\u2019s generic production of the herbicide paraquat, the insecticide abamectin used for citrus and tree nuts and the fungicide chlorothalonil, used for peanut and potato crops.",
        "U. S. President Donald Trump accused Syrian President Bashar \u2019s government of going \u201dbeyond a red line\u201d with a poison gas attack on civilians and said his attitude toward Syria and Assad had changed, but gave no indication of how he would respond. Trump said the attack, which killed at least 70 people, many of them children, \u201dcrosses many, many lines\u201d an allusion to his predecessor Barack Obama\u2019s threat to topple Assad with air strikes if he used such weapons. His accusations against Assad put him directly at odds with Moscow, the Syrian\u2019s president principal backer.",
        "The Syrian army jet that hit the town of Khan Sheikhoun at dawn dropped three conventional bombs and a fourth one that made little sound at impact but produced a cloud of white smoke, according to an activist observing from a nearby hilltop. Hussam Salloum, a volunteer with an air raid warning service in areas, said the that attacked on Tuesday approached at low altitude, leaving behind three columns of dark smoke and the white cloud nearer to ground level. \u201dThe smoke was white and thick,\u201d he told Reuters from Khan Sheikhoun.",
        "In terms of raw casualty numbers, Tuesday\u2019s apparent nerve gas attack near the Syrian city of \u2014 believed to have killed \u2014 should hardly be significant against the backdrop of a war that has left dead. But that was never the point of chemical weapons. Since European powers first used them over a century ago at the height of World War One, they have held a psychological and political shock value in many ways out of proportion to their physical or military effect. Alongside the threat of biological warfare, they hold a very distinct horror.",
        "U. S. President Donald Trump removed his chief strategist Steve Bannon from the National Security Council on Wednesday, reversing his controversial decision early this year to give a political adviser an unprecedented role in security discussions. Trump\u2019s overhaul of the NSC, confirmed by a White House official, also elevated General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Dan Coats, the director of National Intelligence who heads all 17 U. S. intelligence agencies.",
        "U. S. President Donald Trump has told visitors that his retreat is set up perfectly for foreign visits, but the Chinese side was initially hesitant when word came that Trump would like to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping there, according to administration officials. Even after seeing images of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s sessions with Trump at in February, Chinese officials thought the oceanfront, club in Palm Beach, Florida, lacked the symbolic significance of the White House itself. \u201cThey thought, no, it has to be the White House, the symbolism of that,\u201d a senior administration official told Reuters.",

Space Symposium in Colorado Springs.",
        "Venezuela\u2019s opposition lawmakers, some carrying injuries from this week\u2019s protests, on Wednesday sought the dismissal of Supreme Court judges whom they accuse of propping up a socialist dictatorship. Newly militant opposition leaders also announced another round of demonstrations against President Nicolas Maduro for Thursday, despite chaos and violence in Caracas on Tuesday that left 20 injured and 18 arrested.

        "In a vote, the state\u2019s House of Representatives passed legislation that shifts the burden of proof from defendants to prosecutors when the law is invoked to avoid trial. The measure now returns to the state Senate, which last month approved its own version of the bill. Both chambers are controlled by Republicans. Florida\u2019s \u201dstand your ground\u201d law, passed in 2005, received wide scrutiny and inspired similar laws in other states. It removed the legal responsibility to retreat from a dangerous situation and allowed use deadly force when a person felt greatly threatened.",
        "Taser International Inc TASR. O, maker of the eponymous device used by police to stun and incapacitate a person temporarily, is changing its name to Axon as it pushes further into the software business. The Axon name comes from Taser\u2019s unit that sells police body cameras, patrol car cameras and the software for managing the hours of digital footage they generate. In a gamble that police departments will sign up for paid software subscriptions, the company is offering free body cameras to police officers in addition to a year of free access to Evidence."
