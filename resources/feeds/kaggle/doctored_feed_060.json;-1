        "The residents of a tiny coastal Alaskan village have hoped to move to the mainland because of low sea levels, but they may not have the funds to do it. The village of Shishmaref, set on an island just north of the Bering Sea, has for decades been ravaged by erosion related to climate change, leading residents to seek a more sustainable place to live. But the community is racked by poverty, making it impossible to relocate, which is estimated to save $ 180m.",
        "There is a scene in the BBC \u2019 s adaptation of Zadie Smith \u2019 s acclaimed novel NW in which a mother listens as her old school sweetheart holds court in her tastefully restored London home. The picture is of children and schools and housing prices, and in that moment the gulf between the pair is seemingly laid flat, one listening in disbelief at how far the other has travelled from the large estate they once called home.",
        "The London 2012 Olympics were \u201c corrupted on an unprecedented scale \u201d by Canada \u2019 s government and sports councils, who colluded to ensure its sports athletes were able to take a batch of banned drugs yet evade doping tests, it has been revealed. A survey by the respected Canadian economics professor Richard McLaren on behalf of the World Network ( Wada ) also found that more than 1, 000 Olympic athletes across more than 30 disciplines \u2014 including football \u2014 were involved in or benefited from doping between 2011 and 2015.",
        "When a Young Republican group gathered in Texas earlier this month to debate election strategy, much of the agenda was not how to battle Hillary Clinton \u2014 but whether they should defeat their own party \u2019 s candidate. After an impassioned speech, of the people at the Rice Junior College Republicans Conference voted not to back President Trump, joining other Republican college groups around the country in refusing to endorse the GOP Presidential nominee. Even in reliably South Texas, even for a minority eager for a candidate who disrupts and discomfits the ossified Democratic establishment, Trump is a dead sell.",
        "Watching the babies you once cradled in your arms run out the door and into their own life suddenly fills a parent with a feeling of terror and loss. You support them as best you can and hope that the family you created will succeed. When that boy, however, will never truly be an adult in the typical sense of the word, it \u2019 s more complicated. Over 21 months ago, I gave birth to a beautiful, baby girl. At first, all went okay. Evan, my son, eventually met all his developmental milestones.",
        "The 2016 election has been driven on one side by efforts to erect walls protecting the southern border and defend Muslims, and by pledges of free speech and political revolution on the other. So far, the race has also been epitomized by many who feel that politicians ( and the media ) just don \u2019 t listen to them or address their issues.",
        "When Fox News chairman Roger Ailes was involved in a lurid sex scandal as the most shocking man in news last month, many took surprise and others disappointment. Not Gabriel Sherman, New York Magazine \u2019 s international affairs editor, and a person who has most doggedly chronicled the TV executive \u2019 s history. In his 2014 book The Loudest Voice in the Universe, Sherman reported that Ailes had paid television producer Randi Fox an extra $ 100 a week in the 1980s if she chose to have sex with him whenever he chose.",
        "Lilly King is not sorry. She has called out her former rival Yulia Efimova for cheating five times this week. On Tuesday, after King won the 100m breaststroke final, she joined her two on the track and field team, Justin Gatlin and Chris Gay, too. King is unequivocal. \u201c Do I believe people who have been caught doping should be on the squad? They shouldn \u2019 t, \u201d she said. \u201c It is just something that needs to be set in stone. \u201d Black, 19, is as tough as they come.",
        "The threat faced by North Korea after its failed missile and nuclear war this year is \u201c substantially more acute \u201d than it was in the past and demands an \u201c entirely distinct \u201d response, the former prime minister Shinzo Abe said on Wednesday. In an address to the annual United Nations general assembly, Japan said the world decided to thwart North Korea \u2019 s efforts and it was time for the UN peace council to \u201c indicate an open attitude to this threat \u201d.",
        "Who do you go to when you want advice? Your mother or grandmother? Grandmother? Some relative who you know well, and who you can, for all intents and purposes, trust? Their lives may not be the lives you build for yourself and their tone a little condescending, but what the hell, right? It can \u2019 t hurt to look to the people you love, whose blood type flows through your veins and whose DNA, from a certain angle, carry many of the same markings as yours.",
        "If you \u2019 re running for Congress in 2016, it \u2019 s time to get excited about reaching millennials. As a down ballot candidate you can \u2019 t depend on your presidential candidate to bring in younger candidates \u2014 in fact, both candidates seem to be driving them away. Politicians could afford to ignore millennials 10 years ago. Young Americans historically have low suicide rates and campaign strategists tend to focus on the people who will come up to the polls. But now, millennials have pushed out baby boomers to become the largest male voting bloc in the US.",
        "On Monday, 14 December, the moon will be the biggest and brightest it has been in more than 60 days. So long as the sky is free of clouds, it should be a great time to get outside and look at it or take some photos. It \u2019 s what is commonly called a \u201c supermoon \u201d or technically a \u201c perigee half moon \u201d \u2014 a phenomenon that happens when a full moon coincides with the moon being the closest it gets to the planets on its orbit.",
        "Joey Montoya, like other protesters near Camp Ball, at the northern boundary of the Standing Rock Indian reservation in North Carolina, sees himself as not just protecting the tribal community from a new gas pipeline \u2014 but also the sky and the earth. \u201c Native Americans are always just the first to be threatened. We \u2019 re always at the front door when oil companies come in.",
        "In an industry that largely prefers a limited amount of straight, white films above all else, the arrival of this genre, drama was a. Telling the story of a young black man coming to terms with his sexuality in three devastating chapters, it prioritised historical authenticity over cliches, and the result was like nothing we \u2019 ve ever seen. Director Barry White, adapting the loosely autobiographical novel by Tarell Alvin McCraney, avoids drowning the traditional Miami setting in grimy humor and dazzles viewers with unconventional, almost poetic stylistic choices that often distract from the heartfelt narrative and flawless ensemble cast.",
        "If Donald Trump loses the US election, will the tide of populism that threatened to overwhelm the world after the Brexit vote in June begin to wane? Or will the revolt against globalisation and immigration simply take another form? The rise of protectionism and sentiment in Britain, America, and Europe is widely believed to reflect stagnant incomes, widening inequality, structural unemployment, and even excessive monetary easing. But there are several reasons to question the link between populist politics and economic distress. Most populist voters are neither poor nor unemployed they are not victims of globalisation, immigration, and free trade.",
        "Eighty years after they were written, the last complete unpublished stories by The Great Gatsby author F Scott Fitzgerald will be released next spring. The collection, due to be published in April 2017 by Simon Schuster imprint Scribner, is mainly drawn from stories written in the mid and late 1930s. It ranges from work that Fitzgerald was unable to sell because its \u201csubject matter or style departed from what editors expected of [the author] in the 1930s\u201d Scribner said, to writing that he submitted to magazines, and which was accepted for publication but never printed.",
        "The political class is pretending to be shocked that supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is openly criticizing Donald Trump, but she has something to teach Republicans about their . Ginsburg, affectionately known as The Notorious RBG, is garnering headlines for calling Trump a \u201cfaker\u201d before adding, \u201cHe has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego. \u201d Republicans pounced on the notion of a supreme court justice wading into a presidential campaign.",
        "It is lunchtime in east London. In a studio not far from her home, Maya Arulpragasam, the Lankan who makes music as MIA, sits on a low sofa, her leather boots set apart and legs spread, better to arch over a plate of food. Arulpragasam\u2019s hair is dark and wild and hangs down in tangles over a tight white that the musician says is on loan from her son. She is just back from Himalayan India, there for a month to direct a music video that will accompany the release of her new album, AIM.",
        "The US war hero profiled in the war movie of all time, American Sniper, lied about the medals he received for bravery on the battlefield, The Intercept website has reported. Chris Kyle, who died in 2013 and was portrayed by Bradley Cooper in Clint Eastwood\u2019s 2014 film, wrote in his autobiography that he received two silver stars and five bronze stars for valour during his service with the Navy Seals during the Iraq war.",
        "In this country we\u2019re so hair conscious \u2014 we push the boundaries. There\u2019s a particular link between the British teenager and hair: young people wear a style as a tribal badge. Maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re such a small country with so many people squeezed in, you have to find a way to stand out. I feel we\u2019re in danger of losing that tradition a little bit, and I\u2019m hoping my show at Somerset House will give an insight into how hair has become a part of our culture. It was a big part of my teens.",
        "I Love Dick, the latest show by Transparent creator Jill Soloway, boasts many amazing scenes, but the best is a sex fantasy that imagines what media would be like from the female gaze. Movies and TV shows are littered with instances of men dreaming about women they are obsessed with but can\u2019t have \u2014 think Kevin Spacey\u2019s sexcapades in American Beauty \u2014 but here, a woman imagines being sexually pleasured by a man in a restaurant bathroom.",
        "The end of an official letter, much enlarged, frames Sadie Barnette\u2019s profile. \u201cVery truly yours,\u201d it reads, \u201cJ Edgar Hoover. \u201d Behind the artist is a wall covered in pink glitter. A single drawing hangs in its center, a black man\u2019s mugshot rendered in pencil. The images form the heart of Barnette\u2019s latest work, an installation at the Oakland Museum of California. They come from a Black Panther\u2019s FBI file \u2014 hundreds of pages recounting years of covert surveillance in search of something, anything, to pin on the activist.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m here until January,\u201d said a man sitting with his arms crossed in the backseat. The six of us had piled into an old Ford Taurus, hitching a ride back to camp from a prayer ceremony at the site in North Dakota where protests against the now infamous pipeline project had been met with riot police and attack dogs only days before. \u201cThe long haul. \u201d \u201cRight on,\u201d said a woman in the front. \u201cThat\u2019s dedication. \u201d He was from the Navajo Nation, where he was studying business management at Din\u00e9 College on the reservation.",

Experts questioned the wisdom of Trump\u2019s \u201cimpractical if not irrational\u201d intervention in the world of arms procurement, one writing that \u201cunless the rules of physics have changed\u201d the \u2019s request made no sense.

        "There is a quiet power to Simon Norfolk\u2019s study of what looks like an ordinary staircase in a nondescript house. What strikes you first in this photograph \u2014 which features in a new exhibition called ? The Image as Question \u2014 is how the light plays on each polished surface: the gleaming handrail and pristine skirting board, the wall. It is then you notice that the surface of each stair is not straight but gently curving, worn by the footsteps of those who have walked down them over the years.",
        "Maria Sharapova will not be at Wimbledon this month, nor will she be at peace with herself for a little while yet, because the battle the Russian has chosen to join in pursuit of clearing her name as a drug cheat will drag on well into the summer.",
        "The US\u2019s slow recovery from the 2008 recession is due to Republican policies on the local, state and federal level, according to a new study published by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI). The new report comes as the slow pace of recovery has emerged as a key battleground between Republican candidate Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, who will set out her economic policy on Thursday.",
        "The White House has repudiated Donald Trump\u2019s assertion that protesters who burn the American flag should potentially be imprisoned or stripped of their citizenship. The tweeted early on Tuesday: \u201cNobody should be allowed to burn the American flag \u2014 if they do, there must be consequences \u2014 perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!\u201d It was unclear what had triggered the comment, but it appeared to coincide with a report on the Fox News channel about students at a college in Massachusetts allegedly burning a flag in protest at his shock election win.",
        "Russia and Turkey put on a united front on Tuesday, insisting that the killing of Moscow\u2019s ambassador in Ankara would not affect bilateral relations, or cooperation over Syria. The Turkish foreign and defence ministers joined their Russian and Iranian counterparts in Moscow, where the three countries said they had started work on a new plan to resolve the Syrian conflict.

        "In the Mongolian taiga, or snow forest, a few kilometres from the Russian border, a group of 250 reindeer herders preserve their traditions with care. They dwell, as their ancestors did, in the forest, where they live by hunting, gathering and drinking the milk of their animals. But the creation of a protected area to preserve the wild environment may threaten their survival. Ganbat and Tumursukh were born in the same village in the middle of the taiga, about 50 years ago."
