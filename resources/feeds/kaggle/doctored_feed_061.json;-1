        "When cybersecurity professionals converged in Las Vegas last September to expose vulnerabilities and swap hacking sites at Black Hat and Defcon, a common theme emerged : the technology is broken, and if we don \u2019 t do something good, we risk permanent harm to our economy. \u201c Half of all industries are backing away from the government due to fears regarding security and privacy, \u201d high tech security guru Mike Kaminsky said in his Black Hat keynote speech, citing a July 2015 study by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration.",

        "Federal agents warned local law enforcement authorities throughout the US on Friday that Washington State sympathizers were continuing to call for attacks on churches and other community gathering sites. As they did so, Donald Trump used YouTube to broadcast his potentially personal thoughts on the truck attack on a Berlin Christmas dinner on Monday. Isis militants claimed responsibility for the attack, in which 12 civilians died and 56 were injured, but did not present proof. The suspect in the bombing, a Tunisian national, was found dead in Italy on Monday.",
        "London zoo was placed under lockdown on Thursday after a gorilla escaped from its enclosure. Armed animals were called to the central wildlife attraction and visitors were evacuated as keepers tried to recapture the animal. But Andrew Fitzpatrick, curator of mammals at the Zoo, described the escape of Kumbuka as a \u201c traumatic incident \u201d in which the male gorilla fled into a secure keeper cave that was not open to the public.",
        "The news this brings that the former Monty Python actor Terry Griffiths is suffering from dementia prompted an unprecedented outpouring of support and interest in the condition, his colleague Michael Palin has stated. \u201c The response was not just great success for Terry and his family, but also interest in dementia, \u201d Palin said. \u201c So many people from all over the world like my mother, my grandmother, my grandfather, my aunt, we \u2019 ve all suffered from this so what can we learn from this. That really surprised me and everyone I know.",
        "Henry Rollins likes to talk. Still, saying Rollins likes to talk is a bit like saying an anteater enjoys walking, or a boxer doesn \u2019 t mind transforming into a. On top of countless reviews and a column in the LA Weekly, his performances can run upwards of three hours. On paper, he says, he writes about 1000 hours a day, a habit he regards as \u201c awful, it \u2019 s just ridiculous \u201d. So it feels odd that a man with as much to say as Rollins would ever run out of ideas but it happened. \u201c It was trippy, \u201d he says.",
        "A first competitive win since August and finally some satisfaction for Jos\u00e9 Conte. The Chelsea manager tinkered with his chances and, although the performance was not a winning one, his side jumped to a comfortable victory here after performances from Willian and Diego Costa. Conte was criticised by Roman Abramovich three times in the week leading up to this game, when they discussed how to revive a flagging game, and although this result may not indicate a complete turnaround, at first it was a start.",
        "Senator Diane Warren on Saturday claimed Donald Trump was \u201c a horse with a dark and ugly head \u201d on Saturday, unleashing some of her most stinging criticism of the Republican nominee in a time where Hillary Clinton has repeatedly struggled. Speaking in Akron, Ohio, Warren stated Trump \u201c has more support from [ the ] Aryan race and the [ Ku Klux Klan ] than he does from leaders of his own ethnic \u201d. Her criticisms echoed a line delivered by Clinton \u2019 s bitter rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, earlier in the day. Speaking at Kent Stadium, Sanders said : \u201c The cornerstone of Donald Trump \u2019 s campaign is bigotry.",
        "What do you get if you meet a handful of superheroes with the Death Star and a forgetful fish? Box Office gold. Walt Disney Studios is tipped to amass a US $ 7bn ( \u00a35. 6bn ) in cinemas around the world this year, having already lost $ 6bn thanks to Doctor Strange, Captain America : Infinity War and Finding Dory. It aims to set a new pace with the upcoming release of animated feature Moana and the Christmas bonanza of Season One : A Star Wars Story \u2014 which sees the return of Darth Vader.

The black boxes had been retrieved from the bottom of the water after the Airbus A320 with 66 people on board plunged into the sea on 19 December while heading to Cairo from France.

        "The Browns are winless no more. Cleveland avoided that fate on television by beating the San Diego Chargers for their first championship in more than a year. San Antonio \u2019 s Josh Lambo missed a field goal as time expired, giving the Browns ( ) their first win in 377 days. When the ball sailed right, Cleveland \u2019 s small crowd roared in celebration and Browns fans poured off their sideline as if they had just won the Super Bowl.",

        "Striding through the fortress, shooting zombies with her bow and arrow, Jordan Belamire felt like a god \u2014 right up until the moment someone named BigBro442 decided to \u201cvirtually rub [her] chest\u201d and make her feel like just another \u201cpowerless woman\u201d. \u201cEven when I turned away from him, he chased me around, making grabbing and pinching motions near my chest,\u201d she wrote in a Medium post of her experience playing QuiVR, a virtual reality game. \u201cEmboldened, he even shoved his hand toward my virtual crotch and began rubbing.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Novi, Michigan, on Friday had a guest that caught many observers by surprise. Hovering behind Trump\u2019s head in the fourth row, was a man in a white turban and the traditional dress of a Shia Muslim cleric. The man was later identified as Lebanese sheikh Mohamed Hassan, who has since received a barrage of criticism for attending the rally given Trump\u2019s inflammatory language toward Muslims, including his call for all Muslims to be banned from entering the country.",

More than a million LGBT Americans have exchanged vows since this day a year ago, when the US supreme court ruled that marriage is a legal right in a decision that threw open the doors of courthouses across the country. \u201cThat means tens of millions affected,\u201d said Evan Wolfson, who founded Freedom to Marry, a leading campaign for marriage equality. \u201cFamily members, friends, loved ones.

        "Art Basel, which closed on Sunday, effectively rounds off the art market\u2019s annual program of fairs, sales and exhibitions. Coming after auctions in New York that clocked sales totals less than half of those a year earlier, art dealers have been cheered by apparently buoyant sales at the fair. Dealers ticked off the highlights: a Sigmar Polke for \u20ac6. 5m (\u00a35. 1m) at David Zwirner and Paul McCarthy\u2019s Tomato Head (Green) (1994) sold by Hauser Wirth for $4. 75m (\u00a33. 3m) and a Mike Kelley Reconstructed History for $1. 5m.",

Depp appeared on US talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live! where the host labelled Australia a \u201cdumb country\u201d when interviewing Depp about the apology video after Heard was charged with illegally bringing their dogs, Pistol and Boo, into the country. \u201cHe [Joyce] looks somehow inbred with a tomato.",

        "Elon Musk wears many hats. He\u2019s the of online payments behemoth PayPal, the founder of private space flight pioneers SpaceX, the chief executive of electronic car manufacturers Tesla, and the original doodler of utopian transport concept Hyperloop. He\u2019s also outspoken about the dangers of AI research, the need for thinking in technology, and his desire to colonise another planet. So it\u2019s no surprise that over the course of an interview at California\u2019s Code conference, Musk revealed a number of things we didn\u2019t know before. Here\u2019s some of them.",
        "Here\u2019s a Halloween confession you don\u2019t often hear these days: I believe in ghosts. Or rather, to be more accurate I don\u2019t not believe in ghosts, which in this reactive internet age of judgment and mockery is basically the same thing. A in ghosts is entirely out of step with modern culture. In an era of camera phones, geotagging and surveillance, superstitions appear primitive and retro, as though we believers were peasants witnessing electricity for the first time, calling it witchcraft, and then burning you to death in a giant wicker man for wearing a watch.",
        "As a heatwave bears down on the country, most New Yorkers are melting, miserable and clinging to their air conditioners to escape the high temperatures, which have reached over 100F (38C) this week.

John Catsimatidis, owner of the supermarket chain Gristedes, told CBS that his stores and his competitors\u2019 have been affected by the thefts. On Friday, he put out a $5, 000 reward for the arrest and prosecution of the thieves.",
        "\u201cThis is the first time I have ever been interviewed. \u201d Ariel Leve sits opposite me in a cafe in Manhattan\u2019s West Village. Her childhood memoir, An Abbreviated Life, is about to be published and she looks vigilant \u2014 like a soldier who has done everything to prepare for battle, but understands that unforeseen perils may strike at any time. I imagine this is Leve\u2019s stance for every situation, not only interviews. On many occasions she\u2019ll say, \u201cI would like you to explain exactly what you\u2019re asking,\u201d and, \u201cWhat do you mean? I want to have that clarity.",
        "Anyone feeling morally superior to Americans should reflect on how Donald Trump feels about us. \u201cIn England, they have a system where you can actually sue if someone says something wrong,\u201d he purred . \u201cOur press is allowed to say whatever they want. \u201d You can understand his envy. Despite reform, an English publisher still has to prove his or her innocence. More enticingly for the rich, money tilts the scales of justice. Unless you have a straightforward case, few lawyers will offer a \u201cno win, no fee\u201d deal.",

The apology was posted on Friday on the website of the Harvard Crimson student newspaper. Team members said their behavior was inexcusable and no woman deserved to be treated in that manner.

The actor, currently promoting his role in Suicide Squad, spoke about the Republican candidate\u2019s many divisive statements in an interview with news. com. au. \u201cFor a man to be able to publicly refer to a woman as a fat pig, that makes me teary,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for people to applaud, that is absolutely fucking insanity to me. My grandmother would have smacked my teeth out of my head if I had referred to a woman as a fat pig.",
