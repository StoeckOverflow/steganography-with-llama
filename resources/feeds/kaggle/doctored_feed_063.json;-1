        "The Republican presidential majority leader Mitch McConnell opened the door to congressional investigation of Russia \u2019 s potential interference in the 2016 election on Facebook but left the scope of such an investigation vague and unlikely to please those who want a thorough examination of an intelligence finding that has entered Washington. In an indication of the mounting difficulties confronting congressional representatives traditionally opposed to Trump but disinclined to criticizing a GOP president, McConnell told reporters he \u201c strongly condemns \u201d phone hacking and dismissed criticism that the campaign was now soft on Russia.",
        "A federal court in San Diego has cited Donald Trump \u2019 s request for a delay to a trial to examine whether the Trump campaign defrauded customers. US district judge Gonzalo Curiel ruled on Friday that the trial will begin on 28 January, as previously scheduled. California attorney Daniel Petrocelli urged the judge to delay the hearing to 2 January because he must be in Los Angeles on 15 November for another trial. The judge in that court rejected a delay. The Democratic presidential candidate has often criticized Curiel \u2019 s handling of the case, noting the judge \u2019 s Italian heritage.",
        "Donald Trump extended an olive branch to the titans of technology on Wednesday, telling them his goal is \u201c to help you folks do well \u201d at a meeting at his New York headquarters. \u201c We have no formal chain of command around here, \u201d the told the most powerful men and women in the technology business, whom he encouraged to \u201c call my people \u201d and \u201c call me \u201d. \u201c We \u2019 re going to make it a lot easier for you to travel across borders, \u201d he informed the audience.",
        "Nice has become the latest French attempt to ban the burkini, the Islamic swimsuit that has aroused heated debate in neighbouring France. Using practices similar to the bans imposed in a series of other resorts on the French Riviera, the ban barred clothing that \u201c overtly manifests adherence to a belief at a time when France and place of worship are the target of international attacks \u201d.",
        "The first novel I ever read depicting a gay relationship was Thomas O \u2019 Neill \u2019 s At Swim, Two Women. It was the summer of 2002, a decade before sexual equality would seem possible. I was 18 years old, about to start college, hoping to come out to anyone but myself. And as much as I loved that book, I saw myself wanting something more. It took me a long time to discover what that something was : for these characters I needed to have more time together.",
        "An Irish Protestant altar boy has orchestrated the latest suicide attempts to blow himself up as part of Islamic State \u2019 s furious takeover of Mosul, its last major battle in Iraq. Khalid Edward, born Terrence Edward in North Dublin in 1967, converted to Islam while serving a jail sentence in Saudi Arabia for mistakenly brewing homemade alcohol. He was known in Iraq by the nom de guerre Khalid Usama \u2014 a reference to his eldest sister and homeland.",
        "Uber has launched an ethics battle with California over its street cars, with regulators and consumer activists accusing the corporation of flagrantly violating the law, endangering public safety and mistreating drivers. The intense fighting with the state \u2014 which ignited controversy after numerous cars were left running red flags in Uber \u2019 s home town \u2014 has destroyed what critics say are the unethical and corrupt tactics that the company has long used to grow its company.",
        "As Harry Potter and the Cursed Child opens in the West End of London, writer JK Rowling has said the production may soon go ahead. Part one of the show premiered at the Palace theatre on Saturday afternoon, with part two due to release on Saturday evening. The first script will also be performed at midnight, so fans attempting to make it to the theatre will get a chance to find out what happened next to Harry Potter and his friends.",
        "UFC 200 was never intended to be memorable. But not quite like this. And so it is that an event meant to be a celebration of mixed martial arts, an event capping a set of UFC cards in Las Vegas from Thursday to Friday boasting a total of five big fights, was turned on its ass. The final fight of the day is what did it. The reaction to Jon McGregor testing positive for two unknown banned substances was a manic one.",
        "As Emily Colvin, a married woman living in the mountains of Missouri, watched the race results pour in on Tuesday night, her mind began to race with fear. It was time for her to find a class, she thought. And maybe to purchase a job. With the United States running from one of the most bitterly divisive automobile races in its history, throngs of voters find themselves deeply distrustful, and extremely fearful of the winner, Donald Trump.",
        "I think the book needs Star Trek, especially the Star Wars tradition of highlighting scientific progress, as typified by the revelation that the citizens of Sulu will have a husband in the new millennium Star Trek films. Sure, it \u2019 s just a light, fantastical story about ray guns and spaceships \u2014 actually die and come back to life, turn into alien creatures, and have devious alter egos that resemble intimidating goatees.",
        "I \u2019 m 32 and struggling with sudden changes to a much older friendship. Over the past four years I \u2019 ve been rather staying behind with a friend who met the love of her life, getting married and fully embraced her friendships with her husband \u2019 s friends. We made less and less close together and when we did, she seemed disengaged. It nearly broke my heart as I found her one of my closest confidantes. I think at first I dealt with it very well, getting emotional and confronting her about her \u201c neglect \u201d of our friendship.",
        "Kanye West might face legal sanctions and even criminal sanctions as a result of his feud with Taylor Swift if it turns out he never recorded a phone conversation with her in California, according to media experts. Kim Kardashian also launched a media firestorm after she recorded an audio recording of her husband \u2019 s phone call with Taylor discussing Kanye West \u2019 s new song Famous, which included a line about the pop culture. In the song, Kanye raps : \u201c I feel like me and Taylor might actually have sex Why? I made that song famous.",
        "The streets of Bratislava have been spruced up at a cost of \u20ac14m (\u00a312m). Potholes have been plugged, new benches and shiny rubbish bins brought in to adorn the green spaces, along with mobile toilets and free wireless connections. It\u2019s all meant to convey the message that Slovakia is taking its current presidency of the council of the European Union extremely seriously. For the next six months, the government of this small country of 5. 5 million citizens will hold that rotating role. But all of its plans to set the agenda have suddenly become irrelevant.",
        "It took a moment of calmly executed genius to achieve it but, for a 17th year in succession, Arsenal\u2019s Champions League campaign will extend into a new year. Opponents thrashed at the Emirates Stadium a fortnight ago provided a sterner test in the chill of Sofia but Mesut \u00d6zil, peripheral for much of the night, made his presence felt at the last. A player of his quality was never likely to remain becalmed for the entire game.",
        "Barbra Streisand stands as the only star to land No 1 albums in every one of the last six decades \u2014 a fact she made sure to point out near the start of her latest tour, which came to her home borough of Brooklyn on Thursday. Even so, she added, many people still can\u2019t accurately pronounce her name. \u201cIt\u2019s soft like sand,\u201d the star schooled us from stage of the Barclays Center. \u201cYou\u2019d think after 50 years, people would pronounce it correctly.",
        "Lawyers for Melania Trump on Thursday filed suit for $150m damages against the Daily Mail in Maryland state court. The wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is also suing a blogger, Webster Tarpley, from the state in question. In a statement, Trump\u2019s lawyer, Charles Harder, said: \u201cThese defendants made several statements about Mrs Trump that are 100% false and tremendously damaging to her personal and professional reputation [and] broadcast their lies to millions of people throughout the US and the world \u2014 without any justification.",
        "Computer company Dell is dumping a team of cleaning staff just two months after they signed a new contract giving them better pay and new protections against sexual harassment in the workplace. On 1 May, services contractor Able drew up a new agreement which ensured its 8, 000 Bay Area cleaners would be paid a minimum of $15 per hour \u2014 an increase of $0. 76 \u2014 and get better family healthcare benefits. Language was also added to the contract to give protections from sexual violence \u2014 an problem for female staff.",
        "In the future, Amazon could use a drone to deliver a package from a country warehouse all the way to \u2026 a nearby farm. And that, the government said on Tuesday, is about it. The Obama administration commercial drone flights but said it wasn\u2019t ready to let Google and Amazon launch automated drone delivery fleets out across urban areas. The regulations mark the government\u2019s first explicit efforts to define the commercial uses for the horde of small, plastic, buzzing aircraft that are invading America\u2019s skies.",
        "Pyongyang on Saturday rejected the UN Security Council\u2019s sharp criticism of its latest missile tests and blamed the United States for driving the divided peninsula toward an \u201cuncontrollable extreme phase\u201d. North Korea this week conducted its most successful tests to date of a powerful missile it hopes will one day be capable of launching nuclear attacks on the US mainland. They drew a strong rebuke from the UN Security Council, which described the launches as \u201cgrave violations\u201d of resolutions banning the North from developing ballistic missiles.",
        "US army sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, the former prisoner of war who is accused of endangering comrades by walking off his post in Afghanistan, is asking President Barack Obama to pardon him before leaving office. White House and Justice Department officials said on Saturday that Bergdahl had submitted copies of the clemency request seeking leniency. If granted by Obama, it would allow Bergdahl to avert a military trial scheduled for April where he will face charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. The misbehavior charge carries a maximum penalty of life in prison.",
        "The San Antonio Spurs are now just one game away from being eliminated in the second round of the NBA playoffs. But Tim Duncan already looks finished. For years basketball fans debated when Duncan\u2019s abilities would slip and he would fall from his place among the best in the game. The discussion ultimately was deemed futile. Year after year, on through his and nearing 40, Duncan remained excellent. His minutes were reduced as a precaution, but his impact when on the court was as great as ever.",
        "Earlier this year, I wrote an essay about the conflicts that Hillary women were experiencing with their fathers. That piece was inspired by my own dad \u2014 a man who encouraged me to be and strong but who also cast his ballot for a candidate who bragged that his power let him do whatever he wanted to women, even \u201cgrab \u2019em by the pussy\u201d. I couldn\u2019t understand it, and talking about it with him only led to nasty arguments. I\u2019d get too angry at his accusations against Clinton to hear him out. I felt betrayed.",
        "There\u2019s not much that glitters in Gold, a lackluster caper that proves that even the priciest ore can bore. Stephen Gaghan\u2019s new film is an admixture of the capitalist nihilism from The Wolf of Wall Street and the true crime of American Hustle. On paper the elements are there, but unfortunately the alchemy fails. This year\u2019s earlier picture War Dogs, already something of a formulaic copy, comes off looking like quite the jewel by comparison.",
        "For Alan Stansbery, it was a sniper. For Timothy Phelps, it was God. For Haleigh Stallworth, it was Michelle Obama. Many of the people in Cleveland\u2019s Public Square on Tuesday seemed to have something to fear. The space had become the de facto hub for a small carnival of exhibitionists \u2014 protesters, conspiracy theorists, religious extremists and hate groups \u2014 who had descended on the city for the Republican national convention. Hundreds of police circled like cogs in a gear system, then swarmed at the first sign of conflict. Stansbery, a builder from Dayton, Ohio, was holding an rifle.",
        "Argentina\u2019s unions brought tens of thousands of people into the capital\u2019s streets Friday to protest against government job cuts, the elimination of subsidies and other policies of President Mauricio Macri. Closing out three days of demonstrations that included road blockages across the country, columns of protesters waving blue and white Argentinian flags converged in front of the presidential palace to voice their anger at Macri\u2019s government. \u201cIf they don\u2019t hear our clamor, if they don\u2019t give us answers, there will be a social conflict,\u201d said Pablo Micheli, secretary general of the Argentinian Workers\u2019 Union.",
        "Let it be said at once: Trump\u2019s victory is primarily due to the explosion in economic and geographic inequality in the United States over several decades and the inability of successive governments to deal with this. Both the Clinton and the Obama administrations frequently went along with the market liberalization launched under Reagan and both Bush presidencies. At times they even outdid them: the financial and commercial deregulation carried out under Clinton is an example.",
        "In August 1945, the US army dropped a secret over Japan: fully functional nuclear bombs, which instantly killed tens of thousands of people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. More than 6, 000 miles away, meanwhile, in northern New Mexico, one newspaper carried a headline with uniquely local flair. \u201cNow They Can be Told Aloud These Stoories [sic] of the Hill\u201d blared a rushed edition of the Santa Fe New Mexican. The article revealed that Los Alamos \u2014 a mysterious settlement, built atop a picturesque mesa \u2014 had been instrumental in the creation of these new weapons of mass destruction.",
        "With its imposing statue of the Czech patron saint and wide avenues leading toward historic Prague, Wenceslas Square should be the ideal place for defining a country\u2019s national identity \u2014 or at least its name. So when the authorities decided to tamper with Czech Republic\u2019s official branding they may have done well to road test the idea here, where national aspirations have often been asserted, and occasionally crushed, in dramatic fashion.",
        "Russia and Ukraine stepped up security on the de facto border between Crimea and mainland Ukraine on Thursday, a day after Moscow accused Kiev of planning terror attacks on the peninsula. The alleged incidents, which have raised tensions over Crimea to the highest level since Russia annexed the region from Ukraine in 2014, took place over the weekend. Russia\u2019s FSB security service claims to have detained a Ukrainian terror cell with 20 homemade explosive devices inside Crimea, and repelled fire from across the border in a separate incident."
