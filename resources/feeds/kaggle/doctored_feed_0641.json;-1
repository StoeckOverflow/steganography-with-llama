        "The United States will quietly try to calm the waters between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, current and former U. S. officials said on Monday, arguing that the small Gulf state was too important to U. S. military and diplomatic interests to be isolated. U. S. officials were blindsided by Saudi Arabia\u2019s decision to sever diplomatic ties with Qatar in a coordinated move with Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, the current and former officials said.",
        "Montenegro became the 29th member of NATO on Monday and was praised by the United States for sticking to its path of joining the Western military alliance in spite of Russian pressure. Even as Montenegrin Prime Minister Dusko Markovic was in Washington for a State Department ceremony to mark the accession, Russia warned of retaliation against Montenegro\u2019s \u201dhostile course\u201d and condemned the country\u2019s \u201d hysteria.\u201d After the ceremony, Markovic met U. S. Vice President Mike Pence at the White House, but not President Donald Trump, officials said. Markovic\u2019s first encounter with Trump raised eyebrows last month, when the U.",
        "Mexico on Tuesday conceded to U. S. demands for changes in the terms of Mexican access to the lucrative U. S. sugar market, striking a deal with Washington that will likely lift prices of the sweetener to U. S. food processors and consumers. Sugar producers in the United States refused to endorse the agreement in principle between the two governments after pushing for even more concessions from Mexico, raising the possibility that the deal could collapse. The agreement in principle between U. S.",
        "BlackBerry Ltd on Monday downplayed news that Toyota Motor Corp would adopt rival software for its future vehicle consoles, saying it was more focused on the market for autonomous driving technology.

        "A federal judge may tap attorney and longtime compensation adviser Kenneth Feinberg to oversee claims for nearly $1 billion that Takata Corp ( ) will pay out to victims of defective air bag inflators linked to numerous deaths and injuries, court officials said on Monday.

        "British police and security services had previously investigated one of the Islamist militants who carried out Saturday\u2019s attack in London, but with resources scarce, he was not deemed enough of a threat to warrant close monitoring, police said on Monday. The news raises questions about the police\u2019s judgment and increases pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May, who three days before a national election is facing criticism for overseeing cuts to police during her years as interior minister.",
        "President Donald Trump outlined a plan on Monday to privatize the U. S. air traffic control system to modernize it and lower flying costs, but his proposal drew immediate criticism from Democrats who said it would hand control of a key asset to special interests and big airlines. Trump\u2019s proposal to spin off air traffic control from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was part of a weeklong White House focus on infrastructure. The administration is looking to shift the spotlight back onto Trump\u2019s agenda and away from a growing probe into alleged ties between his campaign and Russia.",

Known as net metering, the policy is critical to making residential solar affordable by giving solar owners credit on their bills for energy they produce but do not use.",
        "A deal bringing Amazon Prime Video to Apple TV, announced on Monday at Apple Inc\u2019s developer conference after years of talk, shows how competitive tensions among Silicon Valley titans can stand in the way of serving customers. The logic of linking Apple TV, a device for watching television over the internet, with Amazon. com Inc\u2019s booming service looks obvious. Apple needs great video to sell its TV player. Amazon needs places to stream its TV shows so that people sign up for its Prime club to watch them and buy more toilet paper, too.",
        "Just hours before Khuram Butt and two accomplices drove a rented van into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbed people nearby, he was asking neighbors where he could hire a vehicle.

        "When I rolled my wheelchair out of my apartment block this Sunday morning \u2014 mere hours after three attackers killed seven a few hundred yards away in London Bridge and Borough Market \u2014 the most striking thing was the sense of calm. American headlines such as that in the describing the country as \u201creeling\u201d are . Indeed, is itself a coping strategy for us. If anything, London and Manchester in particular \u2014 like New York after \u2014 are showing a muscular, communal since coming under attack in recent weeks.",
        "Amid the frenetic activity of American shale oilfields recovering from a recession sit a handful of oil towns that seemed impervious as many producers went into bankruptcy and the economy around them sank.

        "Stocks dipped on Wall Street on Monday as a drop in Apple partly offset gains in energy and financial stocks, some of the market\u2019s sectors so far this year. Energy, the S&P 500 sector so far in 2017, and banks, widely underperforming the benchmark attracted bids despite a drop in crude prices and a yield curve that is near its flattest in eight months US2US10=RR. Banks are expected to perform better in a curve environment, in which bonds with longer maturities need higher rates to attract investors.",
        "A kiss from a colorful reef fish called a tubelip wrasse is no one\u2019s idea of romance, being so full of slime and suction, but it is perfectly suited for eating a hazardous diet using one of the animal kingdom\u2019s most unique feeding strategies. Scientists on Monday described for the first time how the fish thrives in the Indian Ocean and Pacific as one of the few creatures capable of dining on corals, one of the planet\u2019s most difficult menu items.

        "U. S. services sector activity slowed in May as new orders tumbled, but a jump in employment to a near high pointed to sustained labor market strength despite a deceleration in job growth last month.

President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed spending cuts for Central America are \u201dnot a good sign\u201d for efforts to reduce immigration from the poor, violent region, the head of the Development Bank (IADB) told Reuters on Monday. Trump\u2019s austere 2018 budget proposal, which is unlikely to get legislative approval, envisages slashing U. S. aid to Guatemala by almost 40 percent from 2016. Aid for Honduras and El Salvador would fall nearly a third, according to last month\u2019s proposal. The vast majority of Central American migrants bound for the United States hail from those three countries.",
        "Oil prices fell nearly 1 percent on Monday on concerns that the cutting of ties with Qatar by top crude exporter Saudi Arabia and other Arab states could hamper a global deal to reduce oil production. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain closed transport links with top liquefied natural gas (LNG) and condensate shipper Qatar, accusing it of supporting extremism and undermining regional stability.

        "The U. S. Supreme Court on Monday faulted North Carolina again in a racially tinged voting rights case, upholding a lower court\u2019s ruling that Republican lawmakers mapped state legislative districts in a way that diluted the clout of black voters.

President Donald Trump took sides in a deep rift in the Arab world on Tuesday, praising Middle East countries\u2019 actions against American ally Qatar over Islamist militants even though the tiny Gulf state hosts the largest U. S. air base in the region.

S. air base and for its \u201denduring commitment to regional security,\u201d sticking to a message of reassurance even as President Donald Trump, via Twitter, applauded a decision by Arab powers to cut ties to the Gulf ally. It was the latest example of the tightrope that U. S. officials are walking as Trump\u2019s tweets raise questions about existing U. S. policy and the carefully scripted talking points used to explain it. In the case of Qatar, the stakes are high. More than 11, 000 U. S."
