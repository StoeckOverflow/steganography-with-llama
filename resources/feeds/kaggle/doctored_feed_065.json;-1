        "Christine Hope Whitman, who as head of the Environmental Protection Agency ( CIA ) under George W Bush at the time of the attacks showed the public the air outside Ground Zero in New York was safe to use, has admitted for the first time she was wrong. Among those who were exposed to toxins released when the World Trade Center collapsed, the rate of illness and death continues to rise.",
        "On a planet of 7 million people, it \u2019 s easy to seem insignificant. Stack up the problems of the world \u2014 hunger, poverty and social unrest, to name a few \u2014 and you might feel powerless to make a real choice. But every now and then, an opportunity falls for a person to be a hero. And when that happens, lives \u2014 and even good \u2014 can transform. Just ask New York City police clerk Ramiro Ocasio. Listen to Ocasio telling his inspiring story. This story is paid for by Principal",
        "The Bolivian government has blocked a donation of hens offered by the American billionaire Bill Gates, as officials said the billionaire magnate needs to study up on the Andean state \u2019 s thriving poultry sector. \u201c How can he tell we are living 500 years old, in the middle of the jungle not knowing how to produce? \u201d the Bolivian development minister, C\u00e9sar Cocarico, told reporters. \u201c Respectfully, he should stop talking about food. \u201d The Microsoft founder and chairman recently said he could donate 100, 000 hens to countries with high poverty levels, primarily in Africa but including Brazil.",
        "Utah is an Independent state in this election. Even though it only has six of the 538 Electoral college votes available throughout the country ( to date, a candidate must obtain 270 of those votes ) Utah would offer an interesting view into America \u2019 s changing political geography. Historically, Utah has been one of the safest Republican counties in the country.",
        "The Philadelphia police department announced it will start using water testing that scientists have said might conceal dangerous quantities of lead. Such tests are intended to monitor for corrosion, and protect the building from lead that can leach into water from public plumbing. But scientists at the US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) have warned for 10 years that Philadelphia \u2019 s testing protocols underestimate the presence of lead, thus effectively deeming dangerous water levels safe.",
        "Tottenham Hotspur had been forced to wait and, as each one of their rivals won on Boxing Day or Tuesday, it might have felt pretty tortuous. But when they finally got their festive festivities under way they made it clear \u2014 and how. Mauricio Pochettino \u2019 s team shrugged off a blow to Virgil van Dijk and a surprisingly sloppy start to produce a game of strength, in which Dele Alli scored twice and both Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Christian Eriksen sparkled around him. Danny Rose was also impressed.",
        "The media have been focusing on the \u201c \u201d since Donald Trump \u2019 s selection of Breitbart CEO Bill Bannon to be a senior counselor in the White House. Bannon has claimed Breitbart America is a \u201c platform for the \u201d. Interest in what the \u201c \u201d stand for was only heightened after video coverage this week from a Washington DC conference hosted by the European Policy Institute, shows attendees giving the Obama salute. The man who suggested the term, Richard Allen, has been taking somewhat of a speaking tour since Trump \u2019 s election, seemingly being profiled in every outlet in the country.",
        "In all the outrage about the unhinged president Donald Trump keeps tweeting and saying, there \u2019 s been almost universal criticism at the fact that Obama will be partly responsible for the entire scope of powers Obama inherits. The Obama administration has not only done nothing to curtail the slew of extreme domestic security and war threats that Trump is about to acquire since the election \u2014 the White House is actively expanding them.",
        "The city of Portland is to buy Pulse nightclub and transform it into a memorial to the 49 people who were murdered there on 12 June, in the deadliest mass killing in US history. The Orlando Sentinel reports that the club has reached a deal to provide $ 2. 25m ( \u00a31. 8m ) for the club, though it does not wish to transform it immediately because it is being attended by so many mourners from both the local region and further afield.",

The court decision, published on display in the Federal Register, classifies many varieties of or masked bee as endangered, due to such threats as habitat loss, wildfires and the introduction of plants and insects.",
        "Ding dong, the man is dead. In the wake of allegations earlier today that Russia had finally banned \u201c \u201d agitator Paul Yiannopoulos from its platform, a chorus of enthusiastic cheers has gone up, a powerful chorus of satisfaction. The Breitbart writer, who also appointed himself a star of the big trash fire campaign as \u201c Gamergate \u201d has been a peddler of inarguable hate speech. Never just speech, though, he \u2019 s cannily began smear campaigns that incited his followers to dogpile other victims, usually women and persons of color, until the targets could no longer use mass media constructively.",
        "A millionaire businesswoman has been kidnapped by an \u201c organized gang \u201d near her home in Nice on France \u2019 s south coast. Jacqueline Veyrac, 76, daughter of Cannes \u2019 s Grand Hotel, was seized from her car on Tuesday lunchtime, prosecutor Pretre said. Her driver forced her from the black 4x4 into another car in front of several witnesses, a source related to the case said. \u201c A girl of that age, kidnapped in those times \u2014 we are all very concerned, \u201d Pretre said. A full investigation has been launched to attempt to apprehend the \u201c organised gang \u201d members and secure Veyrac \u2019 s safe house.",
        "Twitter is responsible for a share of the internet \u2019 s booming online advertising budgets, its executives announced on Tuesday, as the company suffered its slowest growth in quarterly sales since going public in 2013. Facing increasing competition from apps such as Snapchat and Instagram, Twitter is attempting to enable users to stay active on the platform by adding more online video content from Periscope and on Twitter itself. It has signed 250 media deals across politics, sports and entertainment, introducing users to watch live broadcasts and simultaneously comment including live broadcasts of the Republican and Democratic party debates in July.",
        "They are the unquiet dead. Laid out in rows inside a former industrial building on the edge of the Bosnian town of Sanski Most. Some of the skeletons are almost complete, others just a pelvic bone and some assorted ribs, arranged as though to await the arrival of more. This place was used to process wood before Bosnia\u2019s war of the early 1990s, and now it processes \u2014 it endeavours to assemble \u2014 the dead.",
        "Who will become the next chair of the Democratic National Committee? This leadership contest has significant implications for the future of American politics. The choice will help determine how the Democratic party responds to its extraordinary defeats in recent years, ending with the election of Donald Trump. You might think this overwhelming drubbing would cause the Democratic party to reorganize itself into a very different party from the one it\u2019s become \u2014 which is essentially a giant fundraising machine, too often reflecting the goals and values of the moneyed interests that make up the bulk of its funding.",
        "Albania\u2019s opposition Democratic party made a criminal complaint against the prime minister, Edi Rama, on Monday, accusing him of illegally funneling $80, 000 to Barack Obama\u2019s campaign in 2012, in return for a photograph of the two men together. The Democrats brought the case to the prosecutor general\u2019s office, saying Rama \u2014 who was then the opposition leader \u2014 paid the money in violation of US and Albanian laws to gain access to a campaign event in San Francisco in October 2012.",

        "Facebook has censored dozens of posts and user accounts after the death of a Kashmiri separatist militant, who was killed by the Indian army earlier this month. Academics, journalists and the pages of local newspapers are among those who have had photos, videos and entire accounts deleted by Facebook after they posted about recent events in the disputed territory.

Festival organizers announced today they\u2019ve closed on a deal on Fly Ranch, a property in Washoe County, Nevada, for $6. 5m, half what owner Sam Jasick asked for a few years ago (he has since passed away, and his son Todd was more interested in closing the sale).",
        "A pair of deadly shootings of African Americans by police officers over the past week has underlined the critical role of video evidence in resolving controversial cases and potentially preventing civil unrest.

        "Donald Trump will continue to face serious and unprecedented conflicts of interest as US president if he merely steps aside from running his businesses, legal and ethical experts said on Wednesday. Former White House ethics counsels and activists said Trump\u2019s claim that he would soon take himself \u201ccompletely out of business operations\u201d would do little on its own to prevent his financial interests interfering with his duties to the public as president. \u201cIt is not enough unless he is going to sell the businesses,\u201d said Richard Painter, a chief ethics counsel to President George W Bush.",
        "The Catholic church in England and Wales has brought the medieval manuscript Ars Moriendi \u2014 The Art of Dying \u2014 into the digital age, with a website aimed at helping terminally ill people and their loved ones deal with death. Like the original 15th century work, The Art of Dying Well is intended to bring religious comfort and offer practical guidance to people in the final stage of life. The version offers videos, animations and interviews with terminally ill people and their carers.",
        "It won\u2019t be long, the technologists tell us, before we\u2019ll all be vacationing in virtual reality. We\u2019ll can the commute and hold meetings in virtual reality offices. We\u2019ll hang out with our friends around virtual reality campfires, or attend virtual reality concerts. And at those gigs or football games, we\u2019ll also run the risk of getting sexually assaulted. On 20 October, Jordan Belamire (a pseudonym) wrote a Medium post describing how, while she was recently playing a VR game, another player groped her crotch.",
        "Gareth Bale was spotted in a Dinard cafe enjoying a milkshake the other day, taking a short break from the team hotel to inspect the Brittany resort where Wales have stationed themselves for the tournament.

        "It was left to the matchwinner, Olivier Giroud, to say what everyone was thinking. \u201cAt home you have to win and even more so after two disappointing results,\u201d said the France forward. \u201cIt is a big relief. \u201d Of all those of an Arsenal persuasion, however, there was no one more relieved than the manager. As the clock ticked towards and the first supporters began to drift away, one dreaded to think how Ars\u00e8ne Wenger would recover from a third game without a victory after the disappointment of successive defeats at Everton and Manchester City.",
