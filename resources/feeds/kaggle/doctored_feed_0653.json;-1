The rare price war kicked off in late March as Sinopec ( ) reported first quarter retail sales had slid to a low. Spurred by a glut of fuel, Sinopec started offering hefty discounts in response to but frequent promotions by independent petrol station operators.",
        "French unions have lost many of their traditional allies in parliament after Sunday\u2019s parliamentary election result, but President Emmanuel Macron cannot afford to ride roughshod over them if he is to successfully push through his reform agenda. The size of his majority already assured according to official figures and set to be over 350 seats in the 577 seat lower house according to projections means Macron and his centrist party can now count on lawmakers to give his government powers to wave the reform through without lengthy negotiations in parliament.",
        "French leader Marine Le Pen was on Sunday elected to parliament together with seven other National Front candidates, a result that beat scenarios for the party but will not be enough to paper over deep divisions. The outcome falls well short of the National Front\u2019s (FN) target of a \u201dmassive\u201d presence in parliament and also misses its objective of having enough troops to form a parliamentary group, meaning its voice in the lower house will be limited.",
        "France voted a record number of women into parliament, election results showed on Monday, after President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s victorious Republic on the Move (LREM) party fielded a candidate list.

The EU, which seeks to promote free speech and end capital punishment around the world, was due to make its statement last week at the U. N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, but failed to win the necessary agreement from all 28 EU states. It marked the first time the EU had failed to make its statement at the U.",
        "When Stores Inc bought online retailer Jet. com for $3 billion last year, it marked a crucial moment the world\u2019s largest retailer, after years of ceding leadership to arch rival Amazon, intended to compete. On Friday, Amazon. com Inc countered. With its $14 billion purchase of grocery chain Whole Foods Market Inc, the largest company announced its intention to take on in the world.

        "The U. S. Supreme Court agreed on Monday to decide whether the U. S. Constitution limits how far lawmakers can go to redraw voting districts to favor one political party over another in a case that could have huge consequences for American elections.

        "The U. S. Supreme Court\u2019s unanimous backing on Monday of a ruling by the country\u2019s top patent court was a rare instance of agreement with a body whose decisions in that specialized area it regularly overturns. Tellingly, Monday\u2019s decision related to trademarks, not patents. Since its term began last October, the Supreme Court has thrown out all six decisions by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which was set up to handle such cases. Since 2014, the high court has upheld the patent court in only two of 16 patent cases, a Reuters review showed.",
