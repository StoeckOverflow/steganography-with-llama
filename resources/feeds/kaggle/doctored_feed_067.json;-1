        "When Nasa astronaut and marine physiologist Jessica Meir tweeted about entering the \u201c Earth equivalent zone, where water spontaneously boils \u201d last week, one man, whose Facebook bio said he had once been to boot camp, responded as follows : \u201c Wouldn \u2019 t say it \u2019 s spontaneous. The temperature in the room got below the full pressure of the water at first temp. Simple thermo. \u201d Naturally, Twitter ran magnificently, with other users queuing up to congratulate him on his expertise and encourage him to \u201c please explain things in more detail to the tweeting astronaut \u201d. He wasn \u2019 t done.",
        "Nate Goldberg, director of the film The Birth of a Nation, says he does not feel guilty about a rape allegation levied against him in 1999, in a brief interview with 60 Minutes to Chicago on Sunday. Parker has come out in the past about the 2001 trial against him and his former roommate Jean Celestin, who shares story credit with Parker on the film. Parker was convicted of the charge of raping an unconscious girl, and Celestin \u2019 s conviction was later reversed. Parker and the woman had had an intense, consensual sexual encounter.",
        "UN hospital deliveries are consistently failing to support the vast majority of the 590, 200 Syrians residing in besieged areas, and hospitals have been stripped of almost 50 tonnes of potentially lifesaving medical equipment in the past eight years. In some months this year, emergency deliveries reached up to 204, 000 of those in the most troubled cities and suburbs, but in others, the number was as low as 20, 000, the Guardian can claim.",
        "The USA manager, J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann remains, \u201c 1, 000 % sure \u201d his team will qualify for the 2018 World cup despite a rout in Costa Rica last week. He still has the support of President Barack Obama, the coach hosting a gala dinner in Berlin. In an interview with Reuters, Klinsmann said he was disappointed \u201c and even angry \u201d that his team had failed two World Cup qualifiers in the space of five days, having let in a winning goal against the run of failure to lose at home to Russia.",
        "Israeli government ministers and political analysts are pushing the US towards Trump, to quickly abandon his campaign promise to overturn control of US foreign policy and recognise Jerusalem as Israel \u2019 s capital and to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv. Their calls came as one of Trump \u2019 s advisers on Israel and the Middle East, David Friedman, told the Jerusalem Post that Trump would follow through on his promise. \u2018 It was a campaign effort and there is every intention to stop it, \u201d Friedman said.",
        "Police in Columbus, Ohio, on Wednesday approached and killed a boy who was holding a BB gun, authorities said. The air gun which Tyre claimed was holding had a laser scope. An officer mistook it for a lethal injection, police said. The child was shot multiple times and died in a Columbus area \u2019 s hospital. Authorities said officers were responding to a report of a murder in which several people, one carrying a gun, threatened a man and demanded justice. Police said officers spotted three others, including Tyre, who matched a picture of the robbers.",
        "I come from North Texas. I am one of the kind of people here who votes blue \u2014 and I put up with all kinds of ridicule and abuse because of that. Many of the people who vote for Trump are my friends and supporters. Yes, some of them are racist but not all of them are. The way they support Trump is extreme : their needs have been thrown aside for years. Donald Trump is a horrible person. I am sure people are protesting him. But many people here do not see an excuse.",
        "Tackling climate change is the \u201c biggest economic reform \u201d in the history of the US no one who holds political views, the Hollywood star and environmental activist Leonardo DiCaprio wrote on Friday. \u201c There are a few very prominent scholars that still deny the true conclusions of the world \u2019 s government that climate change is imminent and needs immediate public attention, \u201d he told a United Nations awards panel. But \u201c the truth \u201d about climate change has spread like \u201c wildfire \u201d he stated.",
        "A British diplomat has pleaded guilty to several charges stemming from an incident in which he overheard a police officer \u2019 s girlfriend with a plan to shoot Donald Trump at a campaign center in Las Vegas. Sir Steven Sandford could face about two years in a Canadian prison and be deported for his pleas on charge to being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and disrupting an official event. The Sandford could have faced up to 20 years in prison if he had been convicted at Nuremberg of both charges.",
        "Curtis Johnson swept in for a touchdown after Ohio State barely caught a and the Buckeyes beat No3 Michigan in double overtime Saturday to record one of the greatest wins in the history of one of collegiate football \u2019 s greatest rivalries. Facing from the 16, Ohio State coach Bill Meyer decided not to test a potential field goal with a kicker who had already recorded two short yards in regulation. JT Barrett took it on fourth down and slammed into the leg of his blocker, AJ Alexander, back at the line to gain. The crowd stood up to video games.",
        "Emergency measures designed to quell the prospect of hostilities between Russian and English companies were announced on Tuesday amid fears of a \u201c dark day \u201d for the French city of Lille. With Russia in action on London and England on Thursday in via Lens, a ban on alcohol buying from shops and supermarkets in Lille will last until 6am on Friday. Some 350 bars in the city will be required to close at dawn.",
        "Of all the lies that Donald Trump has told, this was definitely the most priceless of all. \u201c No, I \u2019 m a gentleman, Hillary, go ahead. \u201d No need to double check that one because the president could see the truth. As Clinton proceeded to answer a question about health insurance, the man who has boasted about putting himself on women loomed up beside her disturbingly, intimidatingly, nauseatingly. Sunday night \u2019 s congressional debate was unlike anything seen in the American Senate \u2014 and not in a good way.",
        "An enormous and rainstorm has laid waste to much of northern Louisiana, which the National Weather Service has called a \u201c \u201d disaster. By Monday afternoon, more than 20, 000 people had been rescued from the historic floodwaters, and as many as seven had died. People here stay prepared for hurricanes, and all the cataclysm they cause. But this storm did not arrive with strength and velocity instead it lasted over several days, building up almost without warning. Then the rivers topped their banks.",
        "When the writer Rebecca Forster first heard how Google was using her work, it felt like she was trapped in a science fiction novel. \u201cIs this any different than someone using one of my books to start a fire? I have no idea,\u201d she says. \u201cI have no idea what their objective is. Certainly it is not to bring me readers. \u201d After a writing career, during which she has published 29 novels ranging from contemporary romance to police procedurals, the first instalment of her Josie Bates series, Hostile Witness, has found a new reader: Google\u2019s artificial intelligence.",
        "Like his Strangelove, this is a character in touch with vast elemental powers \u2014 and who also makes a miraculous recovery from apparently irreversible disability. Doctor Strange, the newest Marvel superhero, stars in a movie that, perhaps due to misalignments in the multiverse\u2019s parameters, comes too late to be the summer smash of 2016. This exotic is very entertaining nonetheless: an freaky extravaganza with moments of surreality comparable to Christopher Nolan\u2019s Inception yet it wears its digital accomplishment a bit more lightly.",
        "Older Americans are more likely to vote and, when they do, they vote Republican. That\u2019s how the conventional wisdom goes, anyway. The reality is a little more complex. In the last presidential election, 72% of Americans age 65 and over voted, compared to just 41% of those age 18 to 24. Though that gap in turnout is huge, the fact that it exists is hardly surprising \u2014 it\u2019s a pretty fact that the older an American is, the more likely they are to vote.",
        "That\u2019s all for now! Thanks as always for following with us and be sure to check the match report below. And there\u2019s the whistle. The scoreline will make it look closer than it was, considering Real Madrid more or less sent on their youth team when the score was . But it\u2019s nice consolation nonetheless for Chelsea, who today played before a bigger crowd than ever before in their history. Chelsea catch Real\u2019s youngsters out of position and Hazard beats the keeper in a at the end of a quick and they\u2019ve closed it to .",
        "There he is, seated on his wooden front porch overlooking a trim yard in suburban DeRidder, Louisiana, watching for my car. He rises from his chair, waving with one arm and steadying himself on his walker with the other. A 6ft 3in man with a grey crewcut and blue eyes, Lee Sherman, age 82, gives me a welcoming smile.",
        "Uber\u2019s eyes are on a new prize: flying cars. Outlined in a white paper published this week, the company\u2019s chief product officer, Jeff Holden, describes a network of small, electric aircraft that can and land vertically (VTOL, or vertical and landing, aircraft) to enable speedy and reliable commuting that it claims will ease congestion in cities. Uber doesn\u2019t plan to build any of these \u201cflying cars\u201d but has produced a plan called Elevate to set out what needs to be done for the dozens of companies that are building them, including Terrafugia, AeroMobil, Moller International and .",
        "Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has condemned North Korea after it reportedly a ballistic missile from a submarine on Saturday morning, raising international concern over progress in the regime\u2019s ability to launch a nuclear missile. The missile was fired from waters near the town of Sinpo on North Korea\u2019s east coast, where analysts have previously detected efforts by the North to develop ballistic missile systems, said an official from South Korea\u2019s defence ministry, who did not want to be named, citing office rules. He could not immediately confirm how far the missile travelled and where it landed.",
        "There have been   developments following Saturday night\u2019s explosion in Manhattan. Here is a breakdown of the latest key events:",
        "I was actually a very shy kid growing up. And I was also polite. Wouldn\u2019t have guessed that, would you? I\u2019m the eldest of three boys. Mark is younger and Patrick is seven years younger. Mark and I fought \u2014 my mum said I would jump on him unmercifully, as older brothers are wont to do. But when I was 15 and he suddenly grew taller than me I decided it was time to stop beating him up and being mean to him. I\u2019ve been trying to make up for it ever since.",
        "Democrats spent 17 months branding Donald Trump as fundamentally unqualified to be president, a candidate whose campaign was rooted in racism, xenophobia and misogyny. Now they are preparing to work with him in the aftermath of a demoralizing election loss that plunged the Democratic party into an uncertain future. As Democrats look to pick up the pieces from the outcome of the 8 November election, a debate is only just beginning on exactly when, how and at what cost they should cross the aisle to support a who marginalized some of their core constituencies.",
        "Donald Trump outlined an economic vision for the US on Monday, including dramatically slashing taxes, and took sharp aim at Hillary Clinton in an attempt to reset a campaign recently flogged by a series of controversies. In a nearly speech, unusually reading from a teleprompter, the Republican presidential nominee suggested Detroit itself was an example of \u201cthe living, breathing example of my opponent\u2019s failed economic agenda\u201d. \u201cThe unemployment rate [in Detroit] is more than twice the national average,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHalf of all Detroit residents do not work.",
        "Conor McGregor may act like an unrepentant lout at times. He may taunt, scorn and torment his opponents, the way he played with Eddie Alvarez before finishing him off early Sunday morning. He may drive you nuts. But he has turned the UFC into his own little game, in which he makes the rules and picks the prizes. At some point you have to shake your head and marvel. Well after midnight on Sunday morning, UFC president Dana White glowed as he sat at a table beneath the stands and said UFC 205 took in a gate of $17.",
        "A tent on a sidewalk is the only place thousands of San Franciscans have to call home. But if a few of the city\u2019s tech billionaires and millionaires have their way, even that shelter could be taken away. Sequoia Capital chairman Michael Moritz, tech angel investor Ron Conway, and investor William Oberndorf have donated $49, 999 apiece to a divisive ballot measure intended to clear San Francisco\u2019s streets of homeless encampments, according to campaign filings. Zachary Bogue, a tech investor best known as husband to the Yahoo CEO, Marissa Mayer, also pitched in $2, 500.",
        "The Hamilton actor who addressed Mike Pence from the stage has rejected Donald Trump\u2019s call for the cast to apologize for the incident. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to apologize for,\u201d Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays the US\u2019s third Aaron Burr, in the acclaimed musical, told CBS\u2019s This Morning on Monday. \u201cIf people are coming to see Hamilton to leave their politics behind, you came to the wrong show,\u201d he told ABC\u2019s The View.",
        "Whichever way it was supposed to end, it was not supposed to end like this. Alex Rodriguez announced at a joint press conference with the New York Yankees on Sunday that he would play his final game on Friday at Yankee Stadium, against the Tampa Bay Rays, and that after the game he would be given his unconditional release from the club \u2014 at which point he would sign a contract with the Yankees to return to the team as a special adviser and instructor through the 2017 season.",
        ", Dr Mar\u00eda Gonzales cannot recall the exact moment when she realised Venezuela\u2019s health crisis had enveloped her hospital, the Luis Razetti in the Caribbean coastal city of Barcelona. It may have been during a surge in cases of scabies, a skin infection that ought to be easily prevented with soap, water and disinfectant. It could have been her first sight of an emaciated child, something she had only previously seen in medical books or documentaries about famines in Africa.",
        "At first glance the DNA ancestry \u201ccraze\u201d may seem like yet another fad cleverly monetized by the tech industry. But personal genetic testing is much more than a kind of Snapchat filter for your family album. By combining the complex science of DNA testing and the data riches uncovered by the Human Genome Project into an accessible, relatively inexpensive kit, the genetic heritage industry has created an ingenious product: a consumer that tickles one of the deepest, most ancient and potent of human wishes. This wish is not, as it happens, to have scientific proof of your genetic heritage."
