        "Almost 150 civilians have been killed in a week of continuous violence in the besieged northern half of Aleppo, reportedly said as violence continued to grip Syria \u2019 s biggest industrial capital. The military casualty figures cap three months of unprecedented terror in Syria \u2019 s largest city. More than 800 people have been killed since forces loyal to the regime of Bashar announced a campaign to eliminate the opposition in the eastern provinces. \u201c This ferocious campaign is a war of extermination, \u201d reported a doctor in eastern Aleppo, who was wounded earlier this day in an airstrike.",
        "Less than a month after a very public spat with his over who should kick a penalty kick, Columbus Crew have agreed to sell Kei Kamara, last season \u2019 s leading goalscorer, to New England FC for a record fee. The transfer was finalised just before the end of the primary transfer window. The move represented a coup for Revolution \u2014 Kamara topped Sebastian Giovinco \u2019 s tally of 22 goals last season to earn the Golden Boot \u2014 but suggests Columbus were deeply troubled by Kamara \u2019 s collision with Federico Higuain during last season \u2019 s game against Montreal.",
        "Signs of a split in the Clinton campaign over allegations of financial misconduct emerged on Twitter, as key surrogates diverged in their support for the candidate and the way he has responded. \u201c I love my friend Donald Trump when he tells me he didn \u2019 t do it, \u201d said Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and a top aide to the nominee, on CNN \u2019 s State of the Union.",
        "Before there was Isis, the extremist militant force responsible for the most brutal terror attacks and killings of forty years, there was Isis : an girl in London whose mother renamed her after the ancient Egyptian gods of fertility, magic and motherhood. \u201c I was always proud of it, \u201d Isis Hales says. And now? \u201c I just \u2026 \u201d she left off and her mother, Lucy, comes in. \u201c You wanted to change your mind, didn \u2019 t you? \u201d \u201c Yeah, \u201d Isis replies happily. \u201c That was about four months ago.",
        "Atlanta \u2019 s Zoo says a giant panda has given birth to a set of twins. Zoo Atlanta stated in a news release on Facebook that giant panda named Lun Lun born the blind and almost hairless newborn cubs at 7. 20am and 8. 07am Saturday morning.

        "Celebrity groups have not had the best of times : Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale. male contestants are taking a beating. The situation has become so dire that the television news channel Yahoo! Online is predicting the \u201c End of an Era for celebrity idol worship \u201d.

        "Mercury has now covered the entire face of the earth and brought to a close the 2016 eclipse of the smallest planet in the solar system. The images astronomers have captured today have been truly breathtaking. I hope you enjoyed them as much as we did here on the ( always geeky ) science desk. As John Marek Kukula, public astronomer at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, described it, the transit is a special one : \u201c It \u2019 s a chance to feel you are still part of the solar system in motion. \u201d Thanks to all who collaborate with us.",
        "Bruce Arena has been confirmed as the new manager of the US national side. The LA Galaxy immediately replaces J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, who was fired on April.

He will take up his new role on 1 August.",
        "The old adage states that you should never feed the animal. The more you engage, the more likely those devious people are to store away the dirt, allow it to fester and then pelt it back home in your face, as Ghostbusters star Jennifer Jones has discovered so horrendously. Jones, a breakout star of Paul Feig \u2019 s rather hugely divisive remake, has posted what appears to be a final farewell to the broadcast network in the wake of appalling internet abuse.",
        "Robert thought hard about the exact number of Syrian refugees he planned to place in Native American reservations. He originally had options on 50, 000 but thought that sounded too believable. It proved to be more ridiculous. So he wrote his answer : US to House 250, 000 Syrian Refugees at Navajo, Standing Rock Indian Reservations, Of course, that isn \u2019 t funny in the slightest. But on Facebook, a word can go around the topic before the truth has even been discovered. Robert \u2014 who asked that his pen name not be used \u2014 called himself a satirist.",
        "Caroline Aherne, the writer and comedian, has died at the age of 52 after suffering from cancer, her publicist has claimed.

She was born with a rare form of retina disease and later received surgery for bladder cancer. \u201c Caroline Aherne has sadly passed away after a brave battle with cancer, \u201d her publicist Neil Reading says. \u201c The Bafta writer and comedy journalist died earlier today at her home in Timperley, Greater Manchester.",
        "Inside the ancient palace that is Koshary Abou Tarek in downtown Cairo, the air smells of red onions. Plates are heaped high with koshary, a traditional soup containing rice, macaroni and lentils combined with tomato sauce and onions \u2014 a common mainstay across all Egyptian social classes. An average dinner at the restaurant costs the equivalent of \u00a31. 80, and contains an estimated 800 calories. The menu is filled with families who are given a choice of sugary soft drinks as an accompaniment.",
        "In an unlikely place right at the top of a mountain in Piccadilly, the film director George Solondz and I, practically knee to knee, are discussing dog tags. Does he have one? \u201c No. \u201d He wrinkles his nose, on which are placed his trademark jam spectacles. \u201c I guess, I might if someone else would walk it for me. But if I have to find it and pick up after it \u2026 Imagine it \u2019 s still cold out, and it \u2019 s New Year \u2019 s morning, and your dog needs to go. \u201d His voice, normally quite high, raises a notch.",
        "Sheldon Adelson, the former casino mogul and conservative is mounting a campaign against groups on American college campuses and has launched a group that has publicly accused individual students of supporting terrorism and promoting \u201c Black Hatred \u201d. The effort, which has launched at college campuses in California, is challenging the boycott, divestment and sanctions ( BDS ) movement that has become increasingly popular among American university students protesting the US government.",
        "When the Ghostbusters reboot was announced, it was hailed as a victory for feminism. The film stars Leslie Jones, Kate McKinnon, Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy as four women who save the world from an onslaught of ghosts, and I enjoyed it when I saw it. But it bothered me that while all the white women are cast as scientists, the only black actor, Jones, instead portrays a subway worker.",
        "The fossil record is crap. The chances of an organism becoming fossilised are small, and the chance of us finding said fossil are even smaller. More often than not, the fossils that we do find consist of mere fragments of an organism, rather than complete and intact animals or plants. These tattered specimens provide us with a tiny, cracked peephole through which we attempt to view the past. It is like reconstructing the world based on your old niece\u2019s drawings.",
        "Not a single welfare recipient or applicant has tested positive for banned drugs in a Michigan pilot program, part of the growing practice of screening beneficiaries of government assistance for drug abuse. The program, which ends on 30 September, may face renewed scrutiny in the wake of Wisconsin congresswoman Gwen Moore\u2019s proposed legislation to force taxpayers with more than $150, 000 of itemized deductions to submit to the IRS a clear drug test. Under the legislation, applicants who refuse the test would be required to take the significantly lower standard deduction when filing their taxes.",
        "\u201c\u2018You are a writer. You have to speak up,\u2019 I kept telling myself,\u201d said Yasar Kemal, the great Turkish author of Kurdish descent. As a human rights activist and advocate of pluralistic democracy, his task was not easy \u2014 to promote in a land where hatred spoke louder than peace. Since his death in 2015, things have taken a turn for the worse. Yet another terror attack hit Turkey this weekend, aiming at driving a further wedge between Turks and Kurds, and shattering our hopes for peaceful reconciliation.",
        "When Hillary Clinton relinquished her political dream at the Wyndham Hotel on Wednesday, her voice barely quavered. She exuded grace and resilience. The woman has a true gift for giving losing speeches. Some of her supporters, who began demonstrating on the streets to protest Donald Trump\u2019s victory, yearned to hear something else, however. They would have preferred at least a dash of the defiant tone that Hillary Rodham struck in her famous Wellesley commencement address. In that speech, she talked proudly about how the women in her class were too young to know what was \u201cnot possible\u201d.",
        "Staff at some of Paris\u2019s most political and cultural offices stopped work at 4. 34pm on Monday in solidarity with a protest against women being paid less than men. Women\u2019s rights campaigners at the feminist newsletter Les Glorieuses had urged female workers to down tools from that time. They suggested that doing so until the end of the year \u2014 in effect taking 38. 2 days off \u2014 would highlight the global wage disparity that experts say will not disappear until 2186. \u201cFrom 7 November at 16.",
        "Large majorities of both Republicans and Democrats support expanded background checks on private gun sales, including sales at gun shows, Donald Trump boasts on his campaign website. It\u2019s an odd statistic to find as part of Trump\u2019s second amendment policy platform, since Trump himself opposes expanded background checks on gun sales. It\u2019s not clear why Trump\u2019s website would tout the broad bipartisan support for a policy he and the National Rifle Association both oppose.",
        "Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton blitzed five battleground states between them on Friday, with four days remaining until American voters will choose their next president. Clinton began the day with a rally in Pennsylvania, a state where she holds a consistent lead over Trump, while the Republican nominee made a push in New Hampshire. Trump has surged in recent days in the Granite State, where he scored his first victory of the Republican primary contest earlier this year. Clinton\u2019s lead in New Hampshire has collapsed in recent days.",
        "Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has said the purge Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has meted out on rivals after a failed coup would look like child\u2019s play compared with the action he would take if Venezuela\u2019s opposition tried something similar. \u201cDid you see what happened in Turkey?\u201d said Maduro, in a televised public event on Thursday evening. \u201cErdo\u011fan will seem like a nursing baby compared to what the Bolivarian revolution will do if the right wing steps over the line with a coup.",
        "It was a tweet which spoke volumes. No sooner had Andy Murray completed his remarkable ascension to the top of men\u2019s tennis, Nick Kyrgios paid homage on social media. \u201cU the man\u201d wrote the Australian before posting a picture of him rubbing Murray\u2019s head. A heartwarming tennis \u201cbromance\u201d for the ages. Though as the licks his wounds following a meltdown in Shanghai last month which earned severe ATP sanctions and sessions with a sports psychologist, watching his buddy reach for the stars can only have a positive effect. There is, after all, much of Murray in Kyrgios.",
        "Walk past the 110 electric guitars filed on shelves like a library archive, and the dozens of keyboards swaddled in dust, and the ancient amps that the Smiths used at their first gigs, and you eventually come to a toilet cubicle, slap bang in the middle of the room. It looks as if it has briefly parked itself there while waiting for a more suitable home. When you go in, things become even stranger \u2014 pop\u2019s equivalent of the Tardis.",
        "Does this sound familiar? \u201cThe American people are turning us off. They\u2019ve been clobbered by Vietnam, Watergate, the inflation, the depression. They\u2019ve turned off, shot up \u2026 the American people want someone to articulate their rage. \u201d And how about this? \u201cThere is no America. There is no democracy. There is only IBM and ITT, and ATT and DuPont, Dow, and Exxon. The world is a business \u2026 it has been ever since man crawled up out of the slime.",
        "It\u2019s the nightmare scenario for pitchers: a blistering line drive off the bat of a big leaguer, leaving no time for hurlers to move their head or swing the glove up for defense. It doesn\u2019t happen often, but when it does, it makes for chilling video and it makes you wonder why, with just 60 feet and six inches of space between batter and pitcher, why only one of those players is wearing a helmet. When you consider that Statcast now informs of the speeds a ball blasts off of a bat, it makes you wonder even more.",
        "Russia is welcome to send observers to the US presidential election, even if the requests smack of a propaganda stunt, the state department has said. Moscow has been accused of trying to undermine the race through cyber attacks against US political targets, and its observers complain they were refused accreditation. But on Friday the state department spokesman, John Kirby, said there was no policy to refuse Russian observers.",
        "The Russian swimmers Vladimir Morozov and Nikita Lobintsev have lodged appeals against their bans from the Rio Olympic Games with the court of arbitration for sport. Their move comes as the International Olympic Committee announced last night that a IOC panel will have the final say on which Russian athletes can compete at the Rio Games, reviewing all decisions taken by the international federations. Cas has set up a base in Rio for the Games, and Morozov and Lobintsev have become the first athletes to bring cases there.",
        "Veteran actor Jon Polito, famous for his roles in several Coen brothers films, has died at the age of 65, it was announced on Friday. Polito\u2019s friend, film director John McNaughton announced the news on Facebook. \u201cJon was a born actor and will be deeply missed by his legion of friends, fans, family and of course his long time partner, Darryl Armbruster to whom I send my condolences.
