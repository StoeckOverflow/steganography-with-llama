        "If Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders has a chance of drawing voters away from rival Hillary Clinton in South Carolina\u2019s presidential nominating contest on Feb. 27, his best opportunity will be among the young. African Americans support former Secretary of State Clinton by more than a margin nationwide, but among young blacks 18 to 29 years old, that margin shrinks to 46 percent for Clinton versus 33 percent for Sanders, according to recent polling.

Federal Communications Commission\u2019s upcoming auction of broadcast airwaves that can help the wireless industry improve coverage, a spokeswoman told Reuters on Friday.

The next justice could tilt the balance of the nation\u2019s highest court, which was left with four conservatives and four liberals. The vacancy quickly became an issue in the 2016 presidential race. \u201dWe ought to make the 2016 election a referendum on the Supreme Court,\u201d U. S.",
        "In almost 30 years on the bench of the U. S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was strident, colorful, and most of all, conservative. That made him an unlikely buddy for fellow justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. \u201cI love him but sometimes I\u2019d like to strangle him,\u201d Ginsburg, a liberal who bonded with Scalia over a love of opera, once said. Scalia, who died at age 79, was appointed to the high court by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 and built a reputation as one of the nation\u2019s most brilliant, conservative jurists.",

        "Eurogroup chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem rejected calls for banking union regulations to be loosened after weeks of falling bank shares, saying new European rules had caused investors to look \u201dmore critically\u201d at risks born by banks. Speaking on Dutch radio on Saturday, Dijsselbloem, who is also the Dutch finance minister, said stricter rules imposed in the wake of the 2007 financial crisis that would restore confidence in banks. \u201dWe now have much stricter rules for who pays the bill if banks go wrong, and it\u2019s not the taxpayer,\u201d he said.",
        "A global rout in stock markets, currencies, commodities and bond yields has so far defined 2016 as investors have seemingly lost faith in central banks\u2019 abilities to boost inflation, with signs the world economy is stalling. swaps in the euro zone EUIL5YF5Y=R, for example, suggest annual price growth will be just 1. 4 percent even as far out as 2021. \u201dMost people don\u2019t understand what has spooked markets.

The epithets may be characteristic of schoolyard bullies, but there is some evidence that candidates are reveling in the attention they draw. The harshest attacks elicit the biggest responses at rallies, on the Internet and on cable TV."
