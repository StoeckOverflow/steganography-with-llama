        "One possible contender to replace Justice Antonin Scalia on the U. S. Supreme Court is an appeals court judge, Sri Srinivasan, who has credentials and a stellar resume. If he was nominated his background may make it more politically challenging for Republicans as they plan to block anyone put forward by President Barack Obama. Srinivasan, 48, has served on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since he was confirmed on a bipartisan vote in the U. S. Senate in May 2013.",
        "The sudden and shocking death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia opened a new and incendiary front in the already 2016 presidential race, one that promises to divide Democrats and Republicans and, perhaps, Republicans from themselves. The vacancy on the court, which is now evenly split between its conservative and liberal wings, had Republicans calling on President Barack Obama to refrain from choosing a successor to the Scalia while Democrats urged Obama to do as the U. S. Constitution requires and put forward a candidate to face confirmation in an albeit hostile Senate.",

        "Nevada, which is more than a quarter Latino, was one of the states worst affected by the 2008 financial meltdown, with hundreds of thousands of families unable to pay their mortgages and forced to move in a crisis that by some estimates hit minorities twice as hard as whites.

        "World stocks rose sharply on Monday as China\u2019s central bank fixed the yuan at a much stronger rate and oil cemented recent gains, easing fears of global deflation.

        "The Federal Reserve\u2019s rate path \u201ddot plot\u201d has become increasingly detached from financial markets\u2019 projections and risks sending an overly hawkish message that may undermine the central bank\u2019s credibility. Despite falling inflation expectations and turmoil in financial markets this week as concerns about growth mounted, the Fed hewed to its message that it could build on December\u2019s rate rise with further hikes in 2016.
