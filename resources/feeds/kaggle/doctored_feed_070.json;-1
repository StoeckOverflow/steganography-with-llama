        "We \u2019 re opening up a liveblog for viewers on tonight \u2019 s election weekend, but before you jump to the latest headlines, here were some of today \u2019 s highlights as tens of millions of Americans found their way to the polls : I do write this, after the debates, I think my speech really started to keep up well. And then I did a series over the next two weeks, only of you people, really important ones I think. 20, 000, 25, 000 people, 31, 000 others were showing up to these speeches. \u201d Now bring thee to the election site!",
        "It has been a strange day for the Mercury prize : no contestant could find something to complain about in the shortlist. In previous years, the shortlist has variously been upbraided for being too mainstream, not mainstream enough, too narrow or too tokenistic. This year, the solitary voice raised in objection seemed to speak to the Sun \u2019 s showbiz editor, instead decrying the judging panel for failure to nominate Adele \u2014 citing her \u201c sales, huge success and international chart performance \u201d \u2014 commercial success having already proved the most reliable measurement possible of any album \u2019 s monetary value.",
        "The University of Iowa \u2019 s flagship campus is reeling from accusations that a student was charged with assault against five women, including sexual assault and false imprisonment, during his two days at the school. The student, Matthew Cook, has been arrested and questioned in court on Thursday, charged with 15 crimes against five girls, including sexual harassment, strangulation and false imprisonment. His modus operandi, unknown to police and prosecutors, was to befriend fellow students and eventually entrap and viciously beat them, while keeping notebooks detailing his intended targets.",
        "\u2018 Can science bring us to a point where there \u2019 s a way to drive a specific motor? \u201d asks Tinie Tempah as he puts on an EEG ( electroencephalogram ) system, which looks like a black swimming cap with ears sticking out of it. For Professor Slawomir Nasuto and Professor Ian Daly, this is the \u201c Holy grail \u201d at the heart of a project. They \u2019 re hoping to harness the emotional effects of music for therapeutic effect \u2014 \u201c to create a system which ultimately will be able to help individuals with depression and different types of emotional disorders dealing with neurological disorders.",
        "For the city \u2019 s 66 million annual tourists there are streets of Orlando that you can \u2019 t help but envy : the Mickey street lamps the city \u2019 s enormous ferris tank and billboard after billboard hawking the new Harry Potter attraction at Universal Orlando. But there \u2019 s another Orlando that, without Disney World \u2019 s utilidors, you won \u2019 t see in the trip from the airport to the Disney park, unless you come looking for it \u2014 an Orlando with more lush moss than palm trees, one with dozens of tiny lakes, and train lines to ferry people to Disney rather than the Magic Coast.",
        "The roar of the rain was unlike anything Abdulkafi had experienced before. Stones from a kilometre away fell in front of the house where the teacher had taken shelter with his wife and daughter. Arriving at the university in the early afternoon on patrol, he took in the destruction of the Mashhad region of eastern Aleppo, and the students left following the attack. It was the first time, the journalists claimed, that they had documented the destruction of bunker buster bombs in Syria \u2019 s second city.",

The pictures belonging to Kate Middleton \u2019 s sister were offered on WhatsApp to journalists at both the Daily Mail and the BBC by an anonymous seller. The purchase included some of the royal wedding as well as wedding rings and parties. The Sun stated it had been approached by someone using a pseudonym and asking for \u00a350, 000 within 48 hours.",
        "Last year singer Adele singled out a concertgoer for wanting a video camera instead of living in the moment and enjoying the gig. The pop artist pointed to a woman in the photograph and said : \u201c Could you imagine filming me with that video camera? Because I \u2019 m really here in real life, you can enjoy it in real life rather than through your camera. \u201d Adele isn \u2019 t the only celebrity to be irked by the sea of cameras and smartphones they face during public shows.",
        "A Canadian gin manufacturer has apologised after its advertising campaigns and images involving cartoon Inuit men and young women wearing parka costumes sparked discussion about cultural appropriation, Ungava, founded in Ottawa in 2010, makes a gin infused with botanicals harvested from Canada \u2019 s north, and was recently sold to a company for C $ 12m.

        "For the second time in less than a year, two men from the same remote Canadian community have discovered they were switched at birth, prompting outrage and new questions about substandard healthcare for Canada\u2019s indigenous people. David Tait and Leon Swanson were swapped in the Norway House Hospital in 1975 in the western Canadian province of Manitoba, DNA testing confirmed. \u201cI want answers so bad,\u201d Tait said, choking back tears at a press conference in Winnipeg on Friday. He added that he felt \u201cdistraught, confused (and) angry\u201d.",
        "It is almost a year to the day since J\u00fcrgen Klopp stared in disbelief at Liverpool fans streaming out of Anfield before the end of a defeat by Crystal Palace. No one quits early any more. With his side top of the Premier League and turning on the style on a weekly basis, these are the days for Liverpool to savour. Watford were not simply the fifth of six visitors beaten at Anfield this season but the latest team to feel and suffer the punishing effect of the formidable attack constructed by Klopp.",

        "Hillary Clinton deployed the star power of Michelle Obama in North Carolina on Thursday, laying out the stakes in the presidential election and then turning the stage over to the popular first lady. Appearing together for the first time on the campaign trail, Clinton and Obama shared a platform at a packed arena. Both warned sharply against voter apathy. \u201cHillary doesn\u2019t play,\u201d Obama said, after ticking off the Democratic nominee\u2019s professional accomplishments, a line that drew wild cheers from the 11, 000 who came to see the joint appearance at Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum.",
        "Rei Kawakubo will become only the second living designer to have an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute, in May 2017. Following Yves Saint Laurent in 1983, Kawakubo is arguably as influential. The designer, who founded her label Comme des Gar\u00e7ons in her native Japan in 1969 and began showing her collections in Paris in 1981, has been the figurehead of all that is strange, conceptual and artistic in fashion since then.",

        "\u2018I miss everything about England,\u201d says Neil Gaiman, dressed in his customary black jacket and jeans. \u201cI get so ridiculously happy when I land here. It irritates my wife like nothing on earth. She\u2019s like, \u2018What is it about this place? And why doesn\u2019t New York do that for you? \u2019\u201d The author, who now splits his time between Minneapolis and upstate New York, has lived in the US since 1992. Back then, he was a writer whose fans were found in specialist comic bookstores. How times have changed.",
        "Last week, I was privileged to spend two days at the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota. Thousands of Native Americans have been camping along the Missouri river for months in an effort to defend clean water and sacred land from the Dakota Access oil pipeline. I had my heart broken listening to the testimony of Chase Iron Eyes and Bobbi Jean Three Legs in a meeting. I had my hope renewed standing under grey prairie skies beside the Rev Jesse Jackson, bearing witness to the largest gathering of Native Americans in modern history.",
        "It\u2019s been a rough week. So, some respite via the annual Marc Jacobs dress code \u2014 the John Lewis Christmas advert of the fashion industry. To celebrate the launch of his resort collection, the American designer is having a bash. And, as per, it involves a dress code whose gnomic screed \u2014 currently doing the rounds on social media \u2014 is always fun to dissect, especially in the current mood. Last year\u2019s was inspired by excess and Studio 54, and suggested guests arrive by horse. This time, there\u2019s a focus on the 1980s (like his collection).",
        "According to a report in the upcoming issue of the Hollywood Reporter, Donald Trump\u2019s right hand is 7\u00bc inches long \u2014 slightly smaller than the average for a man. We got him, folks! Mission accomplished. Someone dig George W Bush up and tell him to meet us on an aircraft carrier. Finally, Donald Trump has been caught in a lie he can\u2019t talk his way out of. He can\u2019t deny this fact, because his handprint was bronzed for display at the Madame Tussauds wax museum in Times Square. Mr Trump should be issuing his apology at any moment now.",
        "These are wonderful times \u2014 glorious! \u2014 for people like me who are trained for absolutely nothing. The worst thing you can be is an educated expert with any form of experience, especially if you are running for political office. So, given my only certification is a degree in English literature, which means I\u2019m qualified to read novels, something most people manage without accreditation, this means I\u2019m equipped to run a country. Vote for me: I once wrote an essay on Thomas Hardy and the pathetic fallacy! Presidential and prime ministerial candidates have been campaigning on less.",
        "For all that the Ryder Cup involves two sides, it is difficult to deviate from the notion that the narrative of this, the 41st playing of the event, focuses mainly on one. The desire of the United States to end a dismal run against Europe has taken them from one luminary, Tom Watson, to a taskforce and renaissance man in the form of Davis Love III.",

        "At the very start of this piece, I\u2019d like to state on the record that I have no issues at all with Gwyneth Paltrow. She has had no negative impact on my life that I\u2019m aware of, so I have no personal reason to be unpleasant to her. She does, admittedly, receive a lot of criticism, but is that really fair? After all, she\u2019s actually doing remarkably well for someone who was stranded here after travelling from an alternative dimension where the language, social norms and even the laws of nature are completely different.",
        "In the Parisians reportedly ran screaming from the Lumi\u00e8re brothers\u2019 experimental short film L\u2019arriv\u00e9e d\u2019un train en gare de La Ciotat, terrified that the train coming towards them was about to run them down. A century later, cinemagoers were traumatised by The Blair Witch Project, unable to determine whether its story was fact or fiction. Kickstarting the \u201cfound footage\u201d boom that has dominated horror, directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo S\u00e1nchez brilliantly reminded us that cinema\u2019s greatest trick has always been in convincing us that what we are watching is \u201creal\u201d.",

        "If you have been losing sleep recently \u2014 and it\u2019s not inconceivable that the ongoing collapse of the postwar global order has been keeping you up at night \u2014 I have good news. With fortuitous timing, the Canadian cognitive scientist Luc Beaudoin has invented a new cure for insomnia, which he calls the \u201ccognitive shuffle\u201d. Essentially, it\u2019s a method for deliberately scrambling your thoughts, so they make no sense. And since the world these days already doesn\u2019t, what have you got to lose? Traditional ways of tackling insomnia, Beaudoin notes, are largely useless.",
        "He may have thought he was bringing sexy back to the polling booth, but Justin Timberlake could be looking at a jail sentence after taking a selfie while casting his vote in Memphis, Tennessee. The singer flew from Los Angeles to vote at New Bethel Missionary Baptist church in Germantown, and shared a picture of himself doing it on Instagram, with an exhortation to followers to \u201cget out and vote\u201d."
