        "Dozens of people have been kicked out of a refugee camp on the Greek island of Chios after two successive nights of attacks by a bomb. At least two people were wounded after attackers hurled Molotov cocktails and rocks as big as stones from elevated areas surrounding the Souda camp, activists claimed.

To the French capital, then, where the big mystery Fiat returns again, lending its nutty kitemark to a story far short of dramatics. Already a mirthless crime piece waiting to begin, the Kardashian burglary is establishing itself as a key global event of 2016, rich with money and takeouts and significances for a culture struggling to find out what it thinks about aggravated burglary.",
        "What once prompted action now brings something close to weariness : news of a North Korean nuclear test, accompanied by a round of international condemnation and also, in due course, military sanctions. But while this is the fifth year since North Korea began detonating nuclear devices in 2006, it is also the second in just a month. Today \u2019 s device was the most complex the country has set off and, while its order to have miniaturised a nuclear warhead capable of being fired on missiles should be taken with a pound of salt, its programme is steadily progressing.",
        "Nicaraguan president Nicolas Ortega has been by a landslide in an election described by the opposition as the most rigged contest in the five decades since the Sandinista Revolution first came to power. His victory \u2014 alongside his rival, Rosario Murillo, who was standing as for the second time \u2014 extends the relationship of the first couple, five children and also includes many key positions in government and business. Ortega won a fifth consecutive term ( and third in total ) with 72. 1 % of the vote, after 66. 3 % of television stations were counted, the party board said.",
        "The Norwegian journalist who successfully took on the case of Facebook over its censorship of the famous \u201c napalm girl \u201d photograph has encouraged Mark Zuckerberg to publicly face up to his responsibility as one of the world \u2019 s most powerful people. Espen Egil Norwegian, whose newspaper Aftenposten might force the social networking site to back down in it trying to remove The Terror of Wikipedia image from Facebook versions of its articles, accused Zuckerberg of ducking the mark. He branded Facebook a \u201c frenemy of the social \u201d because of the way it dominates the internet.",
        "services Uber and Lyft are suspending traffic in Austin, Texas, after the city \u2019 s voters rejected a measure that would have allowed the benefits to their drivers. Instead, the state upheld stricter regulations that the city council passed in December : drivers are required to perform background checks, clearly mark their cars with the company \u2019 s logo, and not pick up or switch off their passengers in certain areas of the city \u2019 s streets. Uber and Lyft expect those regulations to be repealed, and if Proposition 1, which led to the polls on Saturday, had failed, they would have had their way.",
        "Colin Kaepernick \u2019 s efforts against police shootings and racial assault have been minimized by many because he was the San Francisco 49ers \u2019 backup quarterback, standing behind the lightly recruited Blaine Gabbert. Now he will have a more prominent job as the Niners have named him their starter for Friday \u2019 s game at Buffalo. The situation is not unexpected. Gabbert has struggled in San Francisco \u2019 s last five games, and Kaepernick recently his second, removing a $ 14m injury cap for next year that was previously seen as the final impediment to his becoming the team \u2019 s No1 quarterback.",
        "John Edwards has criticized the third ballot candidates during his HBO show Last Week interview, part of an election that he refers to as \u201c lice on rats on a horse put on fire 2016 \u201d. The host delved into the debate outside of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, who have gotten more coverage than usual thanks to many voters keeping faith in the top three choices. \u201c When your two first options are depressing, any third option seems good, \u201d Obama said.",
        "Christmas music is inescapable this time of year, makes it impossible to hold a positive opinion about the genre. But what drives people to fall into one camp or the other? Here, two people flesh out the very personal sense that the same annual din makes one desolate and the other merry. I hate Christmas music in public.",
        "An interstate gas pipeline has ruptured in central Alabama, spilling 338, 000 gallons of gasoline in an ecologically sensitive area and causing fuel shortages across the eastern US. So many governors in Alabama, Florida and North Carolina have called states of emergency. The pipeline runs from Houston to the New York harbor, and officials say the line \u2019 s customer, Colonial Pipeline, was extraordinarily lucky : the pipeline happened 500ft from the retention facility for a mining company, and all the water flowed into it.",
        "Why doesn \u2019 t anyone want to buy Twitter? After the firm \u2019 s board met on Friday, it told CNBC that there were \u201c no bids on the new \u201d and that instead it was exploring spending cuts \u2014 an announcement that took another in the stock and closed it down 6 % as shareholders who had hoped to make a September swoop from a tech or internet company were disappointed.

        "Ricky Walters is famous \u2014 notorious, even \u2014 for several reasons. There is his reputation as one of the MCs from \u2019s golden age. Then there is his eyepatch, concealing an injury caused by a shard of glass from a broken window when he was 18 months old \u2014 the main reason he gets recognised at home in the Bronx. As he says: \u201cI\u2019m usually the only person walking down the street with a patch on. \u201d His upbringing is key, and gave him his distinctive style as Slick Rick.",
        "With that match wrapped up, it\u2019s time for me to finish the blog. I think you might all be following some kind of football match anyway and I assume I\u2019m not jinxing Roger Federer. Thanks for following, commenting and emailing today. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Gael Monfils, you baffling so and so. Look at the state of this scoreline. The 17th seed has lost to Jeremy Chardy. Dan Evans joins Marcus Willis in the second round! He pings a brilliant backhand past Struff to seal a win over the German.",
        "St Louis\u2019s rap scene has become one of the most interesting in the US over the last decade. In 2000, Nelly\u2019s Country Grammar laid the groundwork, and he was followed by top sellers Chingy and . By 2004 the local landscape was so hot that the New Yorker extolled it in a feature profile, comparing it to Motown in the 1960s. These days, however, things are different. St Louis has a whole new crop of young rappers, and they\u2019re as talented as ever. But none have broken big nationally.",
        "In May this year, as the Indiana primary saw Donald Trump clinch the Republican party\u2019s presidential nomination, I was following his campaign in the same state. In Sungate, a residential development on the outskirts of Indianapolis, I chatted to people killing time in their driveways. As evidenced by the empty homes and long grass, whatever aspirational dream had been sold to the people here had long since curdled. \u201cWe had a bad crash a couple of years ago, houses got foreclosed, factories closing, loss of jobs,\u201d one man explained, as his dog yelped loudly at our camera.",
        "Theresa May has been challenged over her decision to wear a \u00a3995 pair of leather trousers for a newspaper photoshoot by a reporter on a flight to Bahrain, but sidestepped the question to insist she was working for everyone in Britain. The prime minister was interrogated after it emerged she wore the trousers and a pair of \u00a3295 Burberry trainers when photographed by the Sunday Times last month.",
        "A horrific week of violence in the US has cast into sharp relief the troubled relationship between black communities and law enforcement. This latest cycle of violence began with the police shooting death of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, outside a convenience store. A video surfaced showing Sterling being shot by a police officer several times in the chest during a struggle on the ground. The next day, police near St Paul, Minnesota, shot Philando Castile, a cafeteria supervisor with no criminal record, after a routine traffic violation.",

        "Nations and environmental groups have agreed to shut down the domestic ivory trade, despite the resolution nearly being derailed by objections from countries including Japan and South Africa.

If convicted, Slager faces 30 years\u2019 to life imprisonment.",
        "The Greasy Strangler hits the big screen this week and is a strange, grisly homage to cult films and to the midnight moviegoing tradition. From the mad, the bad and the weird, the shocking to the surreal, here are a few of the movies that set the scene for greasy strangling. With El Topo, Alejandro Jodorowsky did not think he\u2019d simulated a psychedelic experience, he believed he\u2019d created the psychedelic itself.",
        "An Australian artist flew a 3, 000 sq ft piece of art over Orlando, New York and Chicago on Saturday, as part of a demonstration against gun violence in the US.

        "Hi Natalie. You\u2019ve moved back to LA after two years in Paris (1). What\u2019s it like to be back in the belly of the beast? People in LA are just wild. French people are very judgemental, or in Paris at least, about how you are and how you look. You would never wear workout clothes on the street or sandals or shorts or wild colours. It was fun to get back to where everyone\u2019s just being free. Did you move back because of the vegan cuisine? (2) [Laughs] Took the words out of my mouth.",
        "Taylor Swift is the entertainer in the world, according to Forbes\u2019 annual celebrity 100 list. The star, whose last album, 1989, has sold more than 5m units in the US alone, raked in $170m from June 2015 to June 2016, to put her at the top of the list. Her new ranking puts her higher than last year\u2019s musician, Katy Perry, who banked $135m in 2015, according to Forbes.

        "As the Rolling Stones\u2019 You Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want boomed over loudspeakers after Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Kissimmee, Florida, on Thursday night, an elderly spectator walked by the media enclosure. \u201cTraitor!

        "The bodies of the football team killed when their plane crashed in Colombia earlier this week have been returned to Brazil. Many of the 71 victims were players or supporters of the Chapecoense football team, which had chartered the plane after reaching the final of the Copa Sudamericana being held in Medellin, Colombia. Brazilian president Michel Temer presided over a brief ceremony at Chapeco airport in Santa Catarina state in southern Brazil, where he posthumously decorated 50 of the victims and offered condolences to their families. \u201cThis event, as you know, shook the whole country,\u201d Temer said.",
        "I wasn\u2019t surprised when I wiped out on my first wave. I hadn\u2019t surfed in over a decade, but my body remembered the physical sensation before I slipped off my board and under the tide. The familiar aftershock of stinging eyes and accidental gulps of salt water, however, were strangely absent. That\u2019s because I was hundreds of miles from the ocean, surfing in a freshwater lagoon surrounded by Texas cattle ranches. NLand Surf Park, the first artificial surf park of its kind in North America \u2014 and the largest in the world \u2014 opened last month in Austin, Texas.",
        "In March 2016, Donald Trump gave a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac). He was forthright about his support for Israel should he become president. He was particularly strong on Iran, and on the nuclear deal with Iran negotiated by Obama, saying straight off: \u201cMy No 1 priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran\u201d. But dismantling the deal with Iran will not be so easy.",
        "\u201cWe come in peace\u201d might be the traditional opening gambit for aliens in science fiction, but we should be wary about beaming back a response to any advanced in real life, Stephen Hawking has warned. Our first contact from an advanced civilisation could be equivalent to when Native Americans first encountered Christopher Columbus and things \u201cdidn\u2019t turn out so well\u201d he cautioned. The comments are made in an online film, Stephen Hawking\u2019s Favorite Places, in which the theoretical physicist takes viewers on his own CGI spacecraft (the SS Hawking) to five significant locations across the cosmos.",
        "Americans throw away almost as much food as they eat because of a \u201ccult of perfection\u201d deepening hunger and poverty, and inflicting a heavy toll on the environment. Vast quantities of fresh produce grown in the US are left in the field to rot, fed to livestock or hauled directly from the field to landfill, because of unrealistic and unyielding cosmetic standards, according to official data and interviews with dozens of farmers, packers, truckers, researchers, campaigners and government officials."
