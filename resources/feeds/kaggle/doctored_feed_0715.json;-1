        "Republican presidential Donald Trump refused to take responsibility on Sunday for clashes at his campaign events and criticized protesters who have dogged his rallies and forced him to cancel one in Chicago last week. When a protester interrupted his speech on Sunday at an airport hangar in Bloomington, Illinois, minutes after it began, Trump derided him as a \u201ddisrupter\u201d and told the cheering crowd: \u201dDon\u2019t worry about it I don\u2019t hear their voice.\u201d \u201dOur rallies are so big and we have so many people, I never hear their voices.",

        "U. S. President Barack Obama promised one of Cuba\u2019s most prominent dissident groups he would raise the issues of freedom of speech and assembly with Cuban President Raul Castro during his March visit to the Caribbean island. In a letter dated March 10, Obama praised the work of the Ladies in White, which marches weekly to protest Cuba\u2019s Communist government, and defended his policy of seeking to normalize relations with Cuba as good for its people. U. S. support for the dissidents is a source of tension ahead of Obama\u2019s visit, the first by a U. S.",
        "Hundreds of thousands of Brazilians flooded the streets on Sunday in the biggest ever protests calling for President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s removal, reflecting rising popular anger that could encourage Congress to impeach the leftist leader.

        "As the world focuses on Zika\u2019s rapid advance in the Americas, experts warn the virus that originated in Africa is just one of a growing number of diseases carried by mosquitoes threatening swathes of humanity. The battle against the insects on the streets of Brazil is the latest in an ancient war between humankind and the Culicidae, or mosquito, family which the pests frequently win. Today, mosquito invaders are turning up with increasing regularity from Washington DC to Strasbourg, challenging the notion that the diseases they carry will remain confined to the tropics, scientists documenting the cases told Reuters.",
        "Oil prices fell about 3 percent on Monday on concerns that a market recovery has gone beyond fundamentals as U. S. crude stockpiles continue to build and Iran maintains little interest in joining major producers in freezing production. Crude inventories across the United States likely hit record highs for a fifth straight week last week, rising 3. 3 million barrels, a Reuters poll of analysts said.

        "The dollar rose against the euro and other European currencies on Monday as investors booked profits from a surge that followed European Central Bank President Mario Draghi\u2019s suggestion last week that the bank may not continue easing monetary policy. The euro zone currency posted its largest gain in a month after Draghi\u2019s remarks last Thursday, but has since given up ground against the dollar. Investors now turn their attention to the U. S. Federal Reserve\u2019s policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday. The central bank\u2019s Federal Open Markets Committee is expected to keep interest rates unchanged.",
        "To some it means upgrading China\u2019s ubiquitous noodle shops, to others it is manufacturing toilet seats. \u201d reform\u201d is the buzz phrase at China\u2019s annual parliament in Beijing, picking up on an expression introduced by President Xi Jinping in speeches late last year. Analysts say it refers to the scaling back of the role of government in business to allow market forces greater room to flourish, such as through the restructuring of companies.",

N. talks resumed on ending the war. Damascus rejected any suggestion of a rift with Moscow, saying President Bashar had agreed on the \u201dreduction\u201d of Russian forces in a telephone call with Putin. Western diplomats speculated that Putin may be trying to press Assad into accepting a political settlement to the war, which has killed 250, 000 people, although U. S.",
        "The latest filing in the legal war between the planet\u2019s most powerful government and its most valuable company gave one indication of how the confrontation could escalate even further. In what observers of the case called a carefully calibrated threat, the U. S.

        "Stocks in major markets fell on Tuesday, with Wall Street posting subpar volume for a second straight session, after the Bank of Japan painted a bleaker picture of the world\u2019s economy and U. S. retail sales data lowered expectations of a strong first quarter. The yen rose against the U. S. dollar, crude oil dropped and emerging market shares fell the most in more than a month. U. S. retail sales fell less than expected in February, but a sharp downward revision to January\u2019s numbers cooled expectations for a strong quarter of growth for the U. S. economy.",

        "Vermont could become the first U. S. state to legalize recreational marijuana use through legislation, rather than by voter initiative, in a move that advocates for the drug say could speed its acceptance across the nation. State representatives this month are set to take up a bill passed by the state Senate in February that would allow adults over 21 to purchase and smoke the drug beginning in 2018.

S. assets are also seen as a good hedge against any future weakness in the yuan.",

        "Oil settled 2 percent lower on Tuesday as the market yielded to technical pressure and worries that U. S. crude stockpiles were still growing amid falling output and refinery maintenance. Uncertainty over how the U. S. Federal Reserve will word its policy statement on Wednesday also fed jitters in financial markets and pushed oil down for a second day in a row.

UL] will be asked about their European tax deals on Wednesday as EU lawmakers ratchet up the pressure on multinationals to pay more tax on their profits locally.
