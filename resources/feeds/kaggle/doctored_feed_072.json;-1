        "The second series premiere of Mr X, which airs on USA on Saturday at 10pm ET ( Amazon in the US ) is a curious thing. After being the new darling of last three \u2014 and a sure bet for many nominations when they come out on Tuesday morning \u2014 people are seeing the dark and twisty hacker drama to be not only as entertaining as the first 10 episodes, but able to provide more of the same.",
        "Another reason, and another set of others have endorsed Hillary Clinton. Is it because of existential threat of Donald Trump, or could it be because many of Trump \u2019 s potential policies conveniently match up with theirs? Longtime Republican foreign policy stalwart and Iraq warmonger Robert Kagan became the latest neoconservative to endorse Clinton for President last week. He has since offered to host a fundraiser on her behalf, as Foreign Policy magazine first reported on CNN.",
        "The FBI has announced that a new batch of documents linked to Hillary Clinton \u2019 s private email account \u201c have not changed our conclusion \u201d that she committed no criminal wrongdoing, FBI agent James Comey told business leaders in a letter on Friday. As campaigning continued ahead of Tuesday \u2019 s presidential inauguration, a Clinton spokeswoman said the administration was \u201c glad this matter is already \u201d. The Democratic nominee \u2019 s campaign, Donald Trump, spoke with anger at the news, and cast doubt on whether the party had even carried out its work.",
        "European trade ministers are to meet on Friday to assess what impact Donald Trump \u2019 s election win will have on transatlantic relations amid public nervousness about his intentions on trade and investment. That anxiety was shared with trade allies and trading partners elsewhere in the world who are unable to see what Trump \u2019 s \u201c America first \u201d approach will entail once he is in the Cabinet Office in January. In turn, the uncertainty bubbled up beneath the formal dispatch of congratulations.",
        "Baltimore Ravens outfielder Adam Smith says baseball fans haven \u2019 t joined 49ers quarterback Michael Kaepernick in his national anthem since because they are concerned about losing their team. In an interview with USA Today, Jones said : \u201c football is a white man \u2019 s sport. \u201d \u201c We already have two strikes against us, \u201d Jones told the newspaper, which noted that Yankees players made up just 8 % of major league rosters compared to 68 % in the AFL. \u201c So you might as well not leave yourself out of the game. In football, you can \u2019 t put them out. You need those players.",
        "Eight villagers from one family, six of them children, were killed by a British airstrike on their home a few kilometres outside Mosul, relatives, officials and Kurdish troops fighting in the city say. The attack happened after a week of heavy clashes in Fadhiliya village, where Iraqi and American forces backed by US airpower were battling Isis militants as part of the push to recapture Iraq \u2019 s second largest city. Filming showed villagers uncovering debris from a pile of rubble that had been a quarry.",
        "A member of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir says she has split from the famed group over its decision to perform at next month \u2019 s inauguration of Donald Trump, a performance she said would be an endorsement of \u201c tyranny and fascism \u201d. She added : \u201c I only hoped I could never \u2018 red roses to Hitler. \u2019 And I certainly could never stand for him. \u201d Organizers of the inauguration, in Washington DC on 20 January, have faced difficulty in attracting talent. The 1960s saw the Beach Boys are still considering an offer.",
        "Actor Jim Carrey is facing a wrongful death verdict over the suicide of his Cathriona White. Richard Burton, White \u2019 s estranged brother, has lodged a complaint claiming the star of The Mask regarding his \u201c immense wealth and privileged status \u201d to illegally sell and distribute prescription medications involved in her death. In complaints filed with Los Angeles superior court, Burton said Carrey provided the medications for White despite knowing she was \u201c \u201d to take them, prone to depression and she had previously tried to end her own life.",
        "She had kept it to herself. \u201c Buried it \u201d and passed on. But when an audio tape dated 7 October of presidential nominee Donald Trump boasting in 2005 about habitually getting away with being a sexual virgin, Shannon Coulter couldn \u2019 t ignore her reaction. \u201c It was a feeling of recoiling. It was emotional, visceral. Then I had a heavy headache for a few days. I was consumed with nausea, \u201d said the television and media marketing office based in the Bay area. Like many women who have watched sexual abuse allegations against Trump unfold, Coulter was aware of her own experience.",
        "The polls are good, but the cosmos may yet attract Donald Trump. Why fret about things when you have Orion? The Republican Presidential nominee, born under a new moon eclipse, has a magnetic edge that could align the moon on 8 November. \u201c Mythologically he \u2019 s Orion \u2014 a constellation. It represents giants. It \u2019 s very appropriate for the whole story of the United States, that \u2019 s why he finds his head here, \u201d said Aleksandar Imsiragic.",
        "Many adventure games with famously protracted running times have one thing in common : they turned out to be bitter disappointments. Spore was Will Wright \u2019 s attempt to simulate the transfer of a life form from the microbiological level to civilisation. It took eight years to build and never truly lived up to the epic climax. The much anticipated Too Human was juggled for nine years from the original PlayStation to a Nintendo GameCube port, finally surfacing as a mediocre Xbox 360 game.",
        "Megan Rapinoe, the American women \u2019 s soccer representative, has said she will continue to kneel during the national anthem \u201c because I simply cannot stand for the kind of aggression this country is allowing against its own people. \u201d Rapinoe, 31, has chosen to kneel in support of 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who sparked a passionate and occasionally ugly debate about injustice, race and patriotism when he stood for the national anthem during.",
        "Police in Vancouver have confirmed they made use of \u201cstingray\u201d surveillance technology at least once, in what is believed to be one of the first admissions by a municipal police force in Canada of using the controversial cellphone dragnet equipment. The revelation came after a push by a coalition of civil rights organisations and Vancouver\u2019s Pivot Legal Society. In a recent letter to police, the groups asked Vancouver police two pointed questions: whether police had used stingray and if they would do so again.",
        "Ali Sonboly finished his paper round on Friday evening, used a young woman\u2019s hacked Facebook account to issue a clumsy invitation to a local McDonald\u2019s, then set off to kill anyone unlucky enough to take it up. The was known to neighbours and schoolmates as a chubby loner who was shunned by classmates and shunned his local community in turn, rarely seen unless he was out on a paper round delivering a local . He had sought treatment for depression and psychiatric problems, police revealed after he shot nine people in cold blood, then killed himself.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s historic confirmation as the first woman to become a major party\u2019s presidential nominee gives her the chance to redefine her personal connection with the American people, advisers said. After a storm of bad news on a divided opening day in Philadelphia, and with Democratic delegates set to formally nominate her to lead their bid for the White House, Bill Clinton was at the centre of this new push to bring to life his wife\u2019s sometimes flat campaign.",
        "The din from the majority that greeted the final whistle was an outpouring of joy after five years largely spent dreading this derby. Arsenal, rampant and irrepressible, have become the latest contenders to expose just how far Chelsea have slipped in the period since they claimed the Premier League. On this evidence, it is barely conceivable that those in blue had hoisted the trophy only 16 months ago. Their current, dishevelled selection surrendered meekly here, just as they had to Liverpool the previous week, from the moment they were breached. It ended up as a brutal humiliation to endure.",
        "In a world scarred by recurrent violence against people and their heritage, the prison sentence handed down to Ahmad who helped to destroy shrines in Timbuktu, marks a new and welcome recognition that deliberate cultural destruction is a war crime. Posterity will remember 27 September 2016, the date of Mahdi\u2019s conviction by the international criminal court, as the day impunity for the destruction of heritage finally came to an end and as a turning point for justice in Mali and beyond. It is the first international trial to focus exclusively on crimes against historical and religious monuments.",
        "People of Earth, We\u2019ve had comedies about aliens (The Neighbors, Alf) and comedies about support groups (Dear John) but we\u2019ve never had a comedy about a support group for people abducted by aliens. Wyatt Cenac stars as a journalist investigating such a group when he\u2019s abducted by aliens himself and starts taking his work home (or to phone home?) with him. Produced by Conan O\u2019Brien and created by David Jenkins, this ensemble comedy is a very human way to poke fun at tropes and rabid conspiracy theorists.",
        "Leonard Cohen was always the grownup in the room. He was young once, of course, but the world never saw much of the modestly successful poet and novelist from Montreal. He was already 33 \u2014 ancient by 60s standards \u2014 when he gazed out from the snapshot on the cover of 1967\u2019s Songs of Leonard Cohen with his shirt, tie and smart . The face suggested that he\u2019d been around the block a few times the voice and words confirmed it. The man knew things about life and if, you listened closely, you might learn something.",
        "Chris Wondolowski and Julian Green scored goals, lifting the United States to a victory Friday over Cuba in its first exhibition game in 69 years at the Caribbean island nation. The US started nine players who likely will be on the field for next month\u2019s World Cup qualifier against Mexico. The Americans struggled to mount attacks in the first half against No139 Cuba, hampered by a bumpy field at Havana\u2019s Estadio Pedro Marrero that had brown patches, but still extended their winning streak to three.",
        "A statement of intent was delivered here, but it was not offered up by Chelsea. Liverpool, for the second season in succession, have prevailed in this corner of London to cast the locals into grisly retrospection and condemn the new regime to their first defeat. J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s wild celebrations on the final whistle reflected the psychological significance of this win. These teams are now level on points below Manchester City but, on this evidence, it is the side from Merseyside who have the more realistic aspirations to contend for the title.",
        "The Obama administration is proposing deeper government involvement in the design of autonomous vehicle systems and calling on manufacturers to share more information about how such systems work and why they fail. A proposal put forward on Tuesday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) calls on automakers to voluntarily submit details of vehicle systems to regulators \u2014 a 15 point \u201csafety assessment\u201d. US transportation secretary Anthony Foxx said on Tuesday at a briefing for reporters the agency would seek to make it mandatory through the regulatory process.",
        "This past summer, I was in Europe. When the talk of the town wasn\u2019t Brexit, it was the US election. It was discussed the way you\u2019d discuss an alien invasion: bizarre. A look at US history, however, suggests that this election is far from unusual, and that Donald Trump\u2019s populist, cry to Make America Great Again emerges from the foundational belief of many early settlers: that they were the chosen ones who saw corruption and fought it, building a world cleansed of its sins.",
        "As the first woman to clinch a major party nomination, Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy is already historic \u2014 and increasingly it looks like Donald Trump\u2019s is too. But not in a flattering way. If last week came the point at which he the campaign and beloved Trump brand, this week may be remembered as the time he finally drove his party\u2019s national security leadership to support the Democratic candidate for president en masse, either by voting for her expressly or by abstaining.",
        "In a matchup of American tennis present and future, John Isner rallied from down two sets to edge Frances Tiafoe in the first round of the US Open. The Tiafoe had a chance to serve out the match in the fifth set Monday, but Isner broke back then pulled away in the final tiebreaker to win ( ) ( ) in three hours and 27 minutes. It was just the second career comeback from two sets down for Isner. Tiafoe had never before played a match.",
        "Hillary Clinton had barely slept in 24 hours when she arrived at her polling station in Westchester County, New York to cast her ballot, on the crisp autumn day that would eventually determine that she would not, after all, break \u201cthat highest, hardest glass ceiling\u201d. The final day of her campaign to be the US\u2019s first female president had seen her blitz through four cities in three battleground states, and culminated in a bespectacled Clinton bounding off her plane to her campaign anthem, Fight Song by Rachel Platten, before a couple of hundred supporters who braved the 3.",
        "Conservatives have pushed education schemes on America for decades, insisting private industry can better serve students than our government. But this week we saw exactly what happens when you let capitalists run college education: ITT Tech. The school is closing its doors on the heels of a federal crackdown on institutions that make a buck off of young (and some older) people who want an education and pathway to success. Research shows that the sector generally targets people, communities of color and the elderly with campaigns promising job prospects that may never materialize.",
        "\u201cThe problems of victory are more agreeable than those of defeat, but they are no less difficult. \u201d Those are the words of Winston Churchill, and they seem particularly appropriate at the moment. Wednesday saw the release of the Chilcot report into the Iraq war, commissioned by the British government. As the former head of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) in Iraq, I believe there is some truth in its findings. There is much in the report which mirrors problems the American government experienced.",
        "Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, has achieved every Trekker\u2019s fantasy, by playing an alien in the new Star Trek film. Bezos is listed, as \u201cStarfleet Official\u201d in the credits for Star Trek Beyond, the third instalment of the rebooted franchise. In interviews on Friday, producer JJ Abrams and director Justin Lin confirmed his appearance. Lin said the billionaire arrived with plentiful security for a day of filming and waited patiently for crews to shoot the single tracking shot that includes his character. \u201cHe was awesome,\u201d Lin said. \u201cIt was like a president was visiting, you know?",
        "Uber lost $2. 2bn (\u00a31. 77bn) in the first nine months of the year despite a surge in revenues, according to reports, adding to the app\u2019s woes as it faces a setback in plans to launch cars. The San firm was valued at more than $65bn in a $12. 5bn fundraising effort earlier this year but has remained secretive about its financial performance. People familiar with the matter said Uber had lost $800m in the third quarter and $2. 2bn in the first nine months of the financial year, according to Bloomberg and technology site The Information (subscription)."
