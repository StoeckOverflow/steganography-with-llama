        "The US government has grounded its fleet of Osprey aircraft in Japan after one in the Atlantic near Okinawa, in an operation that will fuel further local outrage over the US deployment on the island. The Pentagon described the crash on Tuesday night as a \u201c mishap \u201d and revealed the Osprey had landed in shallow water 0. 6 miles ( 1km ) off the coast of Nago in southern Okinawa. Five crew members were injured. But surveillance footage suggested it had been more successful, with the main wings of the crashed aircraft broken in three and the fuselage drifting in the winds.",
        "On Wednesday the Cardinals finally pushed their most divisive drug expert out the door. The answer is : why did it take so long? Steve Pellman has long been a strange man around the league. Once a sports doctor for the New York Jets, he managed to get himself a key advisor for various sports leagues like the NFL and Major League Baseball. Back in 2005, ESPN rolled him out as an expert on steroids even when congress began looking at drugs.",
        "While many will be gazing into the Olympics opening ceremonies in Rio De Janeiro to catch a glimpse of already renowned figures such as Gisele Bunchen or Gilberto Gil, the star of the show could well turn out to be a diminutive from S\u00e3o Paulo. Despite her nickname, MC Soffia is already three years into her career as a singer, and has gained fame for her lyrics which aim to empower young girls. She tackles the country \u2019 s unique history of slavery and racial division, and challenges the challenges black people are portraying in her rhymes.",
        "Cycling \u2019 s a new game. You ride for two hours, over 150 miles and in the sprint, Mark Cavendish lives. That he did so in a furious sprint, and by the greatest margin in living memory, seems oddly fitting at the end of such a strange, life. The Grand D\u00e9part has undeniably belonged to him. Thanks for joining me, and for your many helpful tweets and emails. I \u2019 m sorry I couldn \u2019 t know more. Bye! Cavendish is still on the podium, and now leads the chase for the green jersey.",
        "A pair of mummified heads found in a tomb in Jerusalem \u2019 s Valley of the Queens are most likely those of Queen Nefertari, the royal daughter of Pharaoh Ramses II, say archaeologists. Thought to have died circa 1250 BC, Nefertari was the favourite queen of Ramses the Great, and was famed at the time for her beauty.",
        "A judge brought the murder conviction of Michael Dassey, the subject of the Netflix TV series Making a Murderer, on Twitter. Federal magistrate Thomas Duffin handed down the ruling in the court of Teresa Halbach of Wisconsin. Dassey and his associate Steven Avery were found guilty in Halbach \u2019 s 2005 death in federal trials. Duffin called the action of Dassey \u2019 s attorney \u201c indefensible \u201d in his ruling. He faulted Steve Kachinsky, the public defender who later represented Dassey, for spending more time talking to the press about the trial than actually communicating with his lawyer.",
        "Adnan Syed, whose murder case gained international attention through the video podcast Serial, has been granted a new trial, marking a stunning victory for the Maryland public. Baltimore judge David Welch on Thursday refused Syed \u2019 s request for a second trial after the podcast featured thousands of internet sleuths go through the details of the murder of Hae Kim Lee 17 years previously. Syed, now 35, had argued in district court that Cristina Gutierrez, his prosecutor in the original trial, had left ineffective counsel and refused to investigate a crucial alibi.",

        "An Indian woman is recovering in hospital after being by a team of men, including some suspected with sexually assaulting her three years earlier, police have informed. Police in Haryana reportedly were hunting for five women accused of abducting the student of the prominent Dalit social caste from attending her college before drugging and raping her in a car. She was discovered unconscious in bushes on the outskirts of a highway last Saturday night in Haryana, which connects Delhi.",
        "The perception of Queensland \u2019 s indigenous people is that they live largely in deserts and other remote areas. And indeed, reflecting in turn the necessity of Indigenous Australians to maintain strong strong links with traditional regions to retain native people, about four in 10 still live in traditional country, far remote from urban centres. But the flipside is equally telling : more than millions of aboriginal Australians now dwell in the parts of the eastern seaboard.",
        "Thailand \u2019 s monarch Bhumibol Adulyadej has died aged 88, following seven decades on the line during which he became a unifying father figure and rare source of information in a country that has weathered more than a dozen coups since he came to power in 1946 aged just 18. A statement from the royal news bureau said Bhumibol, who was the world \u2019 s monarch, \u201c passed time peacefully \u201d at 3. 52pm ( 8. 52am BST ) on Thursday at Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok.",
        "In 1990, I was a junior researcher at the John Radcliffe Institute in Oxford. I had finished all my studies, and was now starting my first course on the wards. Roald Dahl was one of my classmates. I can still remember the time I first met him. It was almost midnight and the lights were dim. I was working away on the laptop computer when I became aware of this large figure coming slowly nearer, like a great big man. I carried on tapping, tapping.",
        "Mary Roach\u2019s curiosity is notoriously infectious. When we first met her, she was in a stack of dead people. Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers, published in 2003, took you on a tour of a body farm at the University of Tennessee, where corpses lay rotting in the grass. It showed you decapitated heads kept in roasting pans, where young plastic surgeons learned to do nose jobs on the flesh of the dead. Nary a page went by without some blood and gore. You went along willingly nonetheless, because Roach is such a winsome presence.",
        "In warm weather, you may get tired of reminders to take a bottle of water with you on crowded trains or to stay hydrated at outdoor events. But what makes you thirsty and how else can you remember to keep topped up? You might think you should avoid salty food when it\u2019s hot. But actually, snacking on a few peanuts or pretzels in the sun can help to keep you hydrated. It\u2019s well known that the body sends a signal to the brain to drink more water when the balance of salt and water in your bloodstream needs diluting.",
        "The Obama administration on Thursday announced its retaliation for Russian efforts to interfere with the US presidential election, ordering sweeping new sanctions that included the expulsion of 35 Russians. US intelligence services believe Russia ordered on the Democratic National Committee (DNC) Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and other political organizations, in an attempt to influence the election in favor of the Republican candidate, Donald Trump.",
        "\u201cThey\u2019ll pay back taxes, they have to pay taxes, there\u2019s no amnesty, as such, there\u2019s no amnesty, but we will work with them\u201d \u2014 24 August, to Sean Hannity, Fox News. Last summer, Donald Trump burst into the political ring with a fiery proposal to build a \u201cgreat, great wall\u201d along the border \u2014 paid for by Mexico.",
        "Say this for the Chicago Bears: they lose with a consistent style seen nowhere else in the NFL. While the Cleveland Browns, the league\u2019s standard bearer for failure, seemingly jump from quarterback to quarterback every week and get a new head coach most every season, the Bears fail with a clear plan in place. Never reactionary or quick to pull the trigger on a move, they simply plod ever forward. A steam ship churning towards a horizon that never has a sunrise.",
        "Kevin Moore sits on a low stone wall at the edge of the handicapped ramp where Freddie Gray was apprehended, thrown to the ground and hogtied with a knee on his neck in Baltimore in April 2015. There is a small shrine to Gray, who died of injuries he sustained in police custody, that has been there for more than a year now. Liquor bottles, candles, a small mural of Gray\u2019s name with wings, and some black balloons, which the wind was blowing away. Moore pulls the balloons back and tucks them lovingly into the corner.",
        "Manchester United pay the highest wages in world football, according to the latest edition of the global sports salaries survey. Average basic pay at the Premier League club has been calculated at \u00a35. 77m a year, or \u00a3110, 962 per week.

        "Donald Trump took full advantage of a racial backlash to the presidency of Barack Obama. He successfully rebooted and gave new life to the Southern Strategy 2. 0 \u2014 which rallied white voters on the back of heightened racial animosity. The \u2019s campaign of coded, \u201cdog whistle\u201d language worked to consolidate a solid 58% majority of white voters. His successful rise was fueled by many things: the fact that there is a black man in the White House, America\u2019s steady advancement towards becoming a country and the fact that minorities are flexing their political muscles.",
        "Misty Plowright believes she will live long enough to see people like herself run for public office and only be asked about real election issues: immigration and gun control, taxing the rich and nuclear energy, universal healthcare, abortion. Someday the other questions won\u2019t come up, because voters just won\u2019t care anymore. \u201cWhen did you realize you were born in the wrong body? How long did it take you to become a woman? What\u2019s it like to be the first transgender candidate for ?",
        "Nativity scenes are the art we see at Christmas, often on cards that put a masterpiece on the mantelpiece. Baby it\u2019s cold outside, so let\u2019s warm our hearts with a bit of Piero della Francesca or Bruegel. Yet we close our eyes to the reality of this art. We turn Renaissance and baroque paintings into empty kitsch when we appropriate them as part of modern Christmas celebrations, which in truth have little in common with the much more religious world that created these images.",
        "Brazil\u2019s president, Michel Temer, is facing allegations that he solicited \u00a32. 3m ($2. 9m) in illegal campaign donations in 2014, further weakening the position of a deeply unpopular leader. In a poll published Sunday but carried out before the new accusations surfaced, 63% of Brazilians said they wanted Temer to resign for new elections. A judge on Brazil\u2019s highest electoral court told the Guardian that the accusations \u2014 which Temer denies \u2014 could form part of an ongoing investigation into whether bribe money helped fund the 2014 campaign that saw Dilma Rousseff president with Temer as her running mate.",
        "\u2018Everyone talks about the soundtrack to their lives,\u201d says Lauren Conrad in the opening of The Hills: That Was Then, This Is Now \u2014 the anniversary special of the reality TV hit that screened over the weekend. And during its run, The Hills itself was the backing track to the latter part of the noughties: it told the story of a zeitgeist and the nature of celebrity, and its legacy lives on in the structured reality genre that dominates TV schedules today.",
        "Quick \u2014 picture Canada. What comes to mind? A progressive wonderland of polite manners and majestic moose? What America might be if it evolved a little? That place you\u2019ll move to if Trump wins? If that\u2019s what you think, that\u2019s fine by us. In fact, it\u2019s our brand: not America. The nice guys. Dull, kind and harmless. That\u2019s how we like to be thought of. But it\u2019s mooseshit. We are not the country you think we are. We never have been. The first prime minister and founding father of Canada, John A Macdonald, was a raging alcoholic.",
        "It\u2019s hard to imagine the start of the Trump administration going any worse: their transition team is in absolute chaos, awash with walking conflicts of interest, and the people they\u2019ve floated as cabinet members are extremists, torture supporters and generally awful people who should be no where near the levers of power. The New York Times reported on the nightmare that is the Trump transition process on Tuesday, which they described as being \u201cmarked by firings, infighting and revelations that American allies were blindly dialing in to Trump Tower to try to reach the of the free world\u201d.",
        "America\u2019s top commander, General David Petraeus, fainted during a congressional hearing as he was being grilled by senators sceptical about US strategy in Afghanistan. His collapse came about an hour into the hearing as a Republican senator, John McCain, questioned him about recent setbacks. McCain stopped his face frozen, as Petraeus slumped forward from his seat on to the witness table. The hearing was suspended as Petraeus, looking dazed, was led out by army colleagues. He returned 20 minutes later, blaming not McCain\u2019s questions but dehydration.",
        "Former NFL star Darren Sharper was sentenced on Tuesday a prison term, ending a tour of shame and punishment in the courthouse where he first admitted drugging and raping women in four states. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor denounced Sharper\u2019s \u201chorrible conduct\u201d and \u201cdisgraceful abuse of trust\u201d during the hearing that concluded prosecutions that unmasked the popular former safety and Super Bowl champion as a serial rapist.",
        "Google must urgently review its search ranking system because of \u201ccompelling\u201d evidence that it is being \u201cmanipulated and controlled\u201d by rightwing propagandists, leading academics have said, after the Observer reported that hate sites are now dominating searches on Muslims, Jews, Hitler and women. Cathy O\u2019Neil, a data scientist and the author of Weapons on Math Destruction, said that unless Google acknowledged responsibility for the problem, it would be a \u201c \u201d with the propagandists. \u201cThis is the end for Google pretending to be a neutral platform,\u201d she said.",
        "Every election cycle, Latinos don\u2019t quite match their voting potential. But every cycle, it should also be said, we come closer. It\u2019s been a long process to merge the gap between potential and reality because to be Latino in America is paradoxical. We are frequently told how powerful we are, how desperately politicians need us if they are to win, and how quickly our ranks are growing. But our lived reality tells a different story. It remains politically expedient to scapegoat our communities."
