        "Actor and director George Clooney, a supporter of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential bid, broke ranks over campaign financing on Saturday to condemn the \u201dobscene\u201d sums of money in U. S. politics and praised Clinton\u2019s chief political rival in the process. Clooney made the remarks in an interview with NBC News\u2019 \u201dMeet The Press\u201d the day after he and his wife, Amal, hosted a fundraiser on Democratic Party hopeful Clinton\u2019s behalf Friday night with a price tag of up to $353, 400 per couple.",
        "Brazil\u2019s President Dilma Rousseff vowed on Monday to fight impeachment in the Senate after a heavy defeat in the lower house of Congress raised the likelihood of an end to 13 years of leftist rule in Latin America\u2019s largest economy. In a raucous vote late on Sunday that sparked jubilation among Rousseff\u2019s foes, the opposition comfortably surpassed the majority needed to send Brazil\u2019s first female president for trial in the Senate on charges she manipulated budget accounts.",
        "Rescuers in Ecuador were losing hope on Tuesday of finding more survivors from an earthquake that killed nearly 500 people and dealt a shattering blow to the South American OPEC country\u2019s already fragile economy. Praying for miracles, distraught family members beseeched rescue teams to find missing loved ones as they used dogs, bare hands and excavators to hunt through debris of flattened homes, hotels and stores in the Pacific coastal region. The death toll stood at 480 on Tuesday afternoon but was expected to rise. The 7.",
        "A deal to freeze oil output by OPEC and producers fell apart on Sunday after Saudi Arabia demanded that Iran join in despite calls on Riyadh to save the agreement and help prop up crude prices. The development will revive oil industry fears that major producers are embarking again on a battle for market share, especially after Riyadh threatened to raise output steeply if no freeze deal were reached.",
        "The U. S. Supreme Court will hear a case on Monday that tests the boundaries of presidential powers, confronting the question of whether President Barack Obama exceeded his authority with unilateral action to spare millions of people in the country illegally from deportation. The case, one of the most consequential of the court\u2019s current term that ends in June, pits Obama against 26 states led by Texas that filed suit to block his 2014 immigration plan. The high court is evenly divided with four liberal justices and four conservatives following the February death of conservative Antonin Scalia.",
        "The United States is likely to see outbreaks of the Zika virus, with perhaps dozens or scores of people affected, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U. S.

The United States has seen more than 350 cases of people who were infected abroad and then returned to the country but has yet to confirm a case where someone was infected within its borders.

        "A growing roster of developing states are turning to their compatriots abroad to raise cash by marketing \u201ddiaspora bonds\u201d a funding strategy successfully pioneered by India and Israel but sometimes tricky to imitate.

S. dollar was weaker against most currencies on Monday after the impact of oil producers\u2019 failure to agree on a plan to curb global supply faded, boosting risk appetite and leaving traders to mull a dovish Federal Reserve. currencies such as the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars and the Russian ruble turned positive against the U. S. dollar after falling earlier on a collapsed plan to cap oil production at current levels on Sunday at a producers\u2019 meeting in Doha, Qatar.

        "Oil prices slid on Monday after a plan by major oil producers to freeze production was scuttled, but a Kuwaiti oil industry strike helped the market pare losses and settle off the day\u2019s lows. The strike crippled more than 60 percent of Kuwait\u2019s crude output, lending support to price benchmarks such as Brent and Dubai. [nL3N17L282] Brent tumbled as much as 7 percent earlier on Monday after oil majors from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia failed to reach agreement on a plan to freeze output at a meeting in Doha, Qatar.",
        "India\u2019s finance ministry is asking for regular progress reports from tax collectors and has set a date for an amnesty to pay off arrears on undeclared domestic assets, as the government intensifies efforts to meet its ambitious deficit target. A series of announcements in recent weeks aims to streamline tax collection in a country where the ratio, at 16. 6 percent, is among the lowest among emerging economies.

        "U. S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders accused Hillary Clinton of apparent campaign finance violations on Monday, ratcheting up the rhetoric against his rival one day before New York state\u2019s crucial primary elections. Sanders questioned whether Clinton\u2019s campaign violated legal limits on donations by paying her staffers with funds from a joint fundraising effort by Clinton and the Democratic National Committee, or DNC. Sanders has long maintained that the DNC has favored Clinton over Sanders. The U. S. senator from Vermont is a democratic socialist who has run as an independent in his Senate campaigns.",
        "Chevron added 1. 51 percent as crude oil prices steadied from earlier losses caused by the collapse of talks among major producers to tackle a stubborn global surplus.

        "President Barack Obama\u2019s bid to save his plan to spare millions of immigrants in the country illegally from deportation and give them work permits ran into trouble on Monday at the U. S. Supreme Court in a case testing the limits of presidential power. The court, with four conservative justices and four liberals, seemed divided along ideological lines during 90 minutes of arguments in the case brought by 26 states led by Texas that sued to block Obama\u2019s unilateral 2014 executive action that bypassed Congress. Liberal justices voiced support for Obama\u2019s action. The conservatives sounded skeptical.",
        "Netflix said it expected to add about 500, 000 customers in the United States in the second quarter that ends in June, compared with Wall Street targets of 586, 000, according to FactSet StreetAccount. The forecast includes a \u201dmodest impact\u201d from the beginning of a price increase for its monthly movie and TV subscription service, the company said.

Under Chief Executive Ginni Rometty, IBM has been moving toward areas such as services, security software and data analytics, while trimming its traditional hardware business by exiting businesses. However, revenue in the company\u2019s newer businesses is failing to make up for declines in its traditional segments.",
        "During a terrifying five hours trapped in the rubble of her restaurant, Filerma Rayo almost lost hope. \u201dI was yelling and yelling and then, at the end, I started to think I would die there,\u201d said Rayo, 33, as she nursed a crushed foot, which had been pinned by a falling piece of cement when a 7. 8 magnitude earthquake shook Ecuador on Saturday.

        "The Federal Reserve is set to hike interest rates more rapidly than investors currently expect, a top Fed official said on Monday, again pushing back on what he said was investors\u2019 too pessimistic view of the U. S. economy and monetary policy. It was the second time in as many weeks that Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren warned that futures markets, which see only one modest rate hike in each of the next few years, are off the mark. He said U. S.",

        "His comments came after the Wall Street bank released results showing that its profit tumbled by more than half. Trouble in markets cut deep into Morgan Stanley\u2019s trading revenue. The business of underwriting stocks and bonds was also difficult. Sliding commodity and oil prices, worries about the Chinese economy and uncertainty about U. S. interest rates scared off traders, investors and companies hoping to issue debt or list on stock exchanges early in the quarter. Morgan Stanley\u2019s a key measure of how well it uses shareholder capital to earn profits, was 6.",
        "It was supposed to be the easiest deal ever reached among key oil market players, a mere formality. Eighteen countries were gathering in the Qatari capital of Doha to the first joint agreement between major OPEC and nations in 15 years, tackling a huge global glut after flooding the market for two years.
