        "Across the nation, new companies are utilizing the internet to transform the ways Americans work, eat, socialize, vacation, look for food, talk to the doctor, go around, and track down a 10ft long boa \u2014 which was my latest Amazon client. These innovations have improved our lives in countless ways, avoiding inefficiencies and leveraging network effects to dramatically grow our economy. This is huge growth.

        "\u201c Mother and I stand next door to each other, one by one daunting hill, \u201d features Carrie Fisher in the HBO documentary Bright Moon, which had its North American premiere at the Telluride film festival on HBO. \u201c I usually come to her. I sometimes come to her. \u201d Alexis Williams and Fisher Stevens \u2019 s documentary film about Fisher \u2019 s intimate relationship with mother Carrie Reynolds will doubtless draw parallels to Albert and David Maysles \u2019 s classic 1975 documentary Grey Roses, which centered on a similarly named duo, who shared an incredibly deep bond.",
        "She could have rushed through the tunnel on Friday night in a hijab, clutching the American flag. What a moment that would have been for a United States where tolerance has been worn out by political pomposity. Ibtihaj Muhammad wouldn \u2019 t have had to breathe a word as her country \u2019 s flag bearer during the opening ceremony of the Rio Olympics. The picture of a Muslim fencer leading more than 500 miles into the world \u2019 s greatest Olympic event would be a lot more potent than any of the invective spilling from Donald Trump \u2019 s curled hands.",

Penn appeared on the program to promote the absurdist comedic audiobook he narrated, entitled Honey Who Just Do Stuff, written by Pappy Pariah. After recounting a preview of how he came on to the project, Penn veered following the commercial intro to Monday \u2019 s presidential debates between Trump and Hillary Clinton, which Penn said he didn \u2019 t like because it was more of a \u201c social debate \u201d.",
        "Dawn in earnest, and the of early morning amid the grim horrors of the night before. Pushchairs tumbled over the esplanade and onto the beach deck, lying on their side on the sand, abandoned by parents struggling to get their children out of harm \u2019 s way and between the smears of dried blood staining the tarmac, the blue blankets covering some of the 84 men, women and children who died.",

Children can now take their pictures \u2014 or anything else, for that moment \u2014 photograph them against a white background, and animate them on a screen, creating 3D characters they can manipulate. This will trouble some. \u201c last time \u201d has, after all, become the mirror of our times.",
        "Jack Smith makes his first Hudson River Derby appearance and New York United FC beat the Birmingham Bulls for the first time. Coincidence? I think not. That \u2019 s facetious, of course. Nevertheless, the fact is that NYC FC have struggled for consistent play from the wings since... well, since forever. And they have gone through several options to find the right player to help unleash the threat that is David Lynch. Khiry Shelton, Tony Williams, Ned Grabavoy, Javier Calle, Kwadwo Poku \u2014 each have had their say. But none have been as convincing as the playmaker.",

        "So, in Ryan Lochte the International Olympic Committee finally has its poster boy. Nothing says \u201cIOC, bitch!\u201d like landing in a host city, extracting personal glory from it, partying it up and then leaving the place more broken and out of pocket than you found it. It\u2019s such an IOC move, dude.

        "Last Saturday, a phone rang at the White House. The caller was requesting the president. The message was relayed and Barack Obama returned the call. On the other end of the line was Donald Trump. All that is known about the conversation is that it lasted 45 minutes. What was discussed, and in what tone, is not matter of record and is perhaps familiar only to the two men. But it is not the only time that the 45th president has called the 44th in what must be the most peculiar handover of modern times.",

        "I can relate to Ryan Lochte. Well, not completely. After all, I\u2019m not an immaculately conditioned Olympic athlete. I also couldn\u2019t pull off dying my hair the color of wet oatmeal. No, what I actually relate to is feeling the need to lie to your mother, as reports suggest he may have done. Who among us hasn\u2019t at one time or another chosen to stretch the truth to save our poor moms the heartbreak of knowing their child is fallible? I\u2019m certainly not above it.",

        "Ask a stranger aimlessly wandering the streets of your home town about their thoughts on the year of our Lord 2016 and chances are good that they will tell you that the last 12 months of human history are the worst on record. Irreparable climate change, the rise of governments all over the world, the deaths of beloved pop culture icons, the proliferation of domestic and international terrorism, the Syrian civil war and its accompanying refugee crisis, and the release of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice have all led to the labeling of 2016 as the absolute shits.",
