        "At least 24 senators have accused the Republican Presidential nominee, Donald Trump, of inappropriate sexual practices in multiple incidents spanning the last 30 years. Of those, 12 have accused Trump of sexual abuse, including groping and kissing them without permission, During the second Senate debate, Trump denied ever having kissed and touched women without their permission, following the release of a 2005 article in which Trump bragged about how he could lick women \u2019 s genitals and \u201c just start seeing \u201d women with impunity because he was famous. \u201c Have you ever done those things? \u201d moderator Robert Cooper asked in the final debate.",
        "\u201c I never met [ Vladimir ] Putin. I don \u2019 t care who Putin is. \u201d \u2014 27 July, Doral stated, It \u2019 s not clear whether anyone has ever spoken with the Russian president. Putin was scheduled to but did not attend a 2013 beauty contest in Moscow, according to one of the oligarchs who helped organize the pageant. \u201c Will he become my new best friend? \u201d Trump said beforehand. But the pair may have talked through intermediaries.",
        "I \u2019 ll get to my first story in a minute but first let \u2019 s jump to the happy ending. Well, a kind of happy ending. The exception is my parents \u2019 house in Little Malden, Surrey. I was 13 and incredibly happy to be living in a house with a formal garden after many days of country hopping and cramped living. What \u2019 s more, I was about the prospect of getting a puppy. My younger sister, who was just as smart, was a junior member of the RSPCA and she had recommended we get a dog through them.",
        "A senior geneticist and a bioethicist explained on Friday that they fear \u201c rogue scientists \u201d operating within the bounds of law, and countered with a US intelligence agent \u2019 s assertion this week that DNA editing technology may have huge, and potentially catastrophic, consequences. \u201c I \u2019 m very, very concerned about this whole notion of there being rogue researchers doing these things, \u201d geneticist Robin told reporters at the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) meeting in Washington DC, referring to the unregulated work of gene scientists. \u201c It really scares me, it \u2019 s bad for the people.",
        "A \u201c polite and gentle \u201d boy from Afghanistan has been implicated in a incident on the motorway connecting to Calais port, explaining the extreme risks that terrorists take every child as they attempt to join ISIL in the UK. The boy was forced to climb on to the roof of a lorry that had collided as it approached the port in the early hours of Friday afternoon, according to. They said another child was attempting to force the boy on to the moving bus, but he lost his grip and collapsed onto the road, where a car hit him.",
        "One of the nation \u2019 s most virulent incubators of fake news information about the US election has included a crackdown on conspiracy theories and \u201c outlandish or unverified information \u201d. Moderators on a Reddit group which became a starting point for supporters of Donald Trump during the election, admitted on Tuesday morning that they had been missing some posts about two conspiracy theories because they were \u201c drowning out political discussion or Trump campaign content \u201d.",
        "Why are we all so shocked by the sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump? It has always been known that his attitudes toward women are dangerously retrograde he \u2019 s never managed to hide who he is. Quite the contrary in fact he \u2019 s built a different brand out of being an offensive playboy who \u2019 s going to get away with it. In addition, he \u2019 s built his entire reputation on the foundation of what feminist academics call \u201c rape culture \u201d.",
        "Who would buy a crossword clue? You can imagine it as the character in a lost Inspector Hastings yarn : a don with a sideline in setting who pinches another \u2019 s pithy anagram, a trick only discovered when his corpse is discovered bobbing under Magdalen bridge. In real life? Those who compile crosswords do so for love \u2014 it \u2019 s decidedly not for the money \u2014 and nothing can stop them endlessly rearranging the English translation into teasing puzzles.",
        "For years, Rich, a refinery operator from Wilmington, Delaware, was a typical American business owner. He had only one or two guns, including a handgun he stashed in a desk drawer in his bedroom. He always took it out and never fired it. Then, in December 2012, 20 were murdered in a mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, sparking several calls for a ban on the guns the shooter had used.",
        "William Christenberry, who has died aged 80, was a pioneer of light colour photography. His richly hued images of the vernacular architecture of the American south \u2014 wooden cabins, shacks and dilapidated houses \u2014 were all made in Wilcox County, Alabama, outside of the city of Tuscaloosa, where Christenberry was born and raised. Their cumulative power stems from the strong sense of history they evoke, as well as their evocation of a rural country that, even as he was chronicling it back in the 1950s and 60s, was fast fading into history.",
        "For university groups around the country, freshers \u2019 consent has just come to a close. Already associated with frenzied socialising and drinking, in recent years it has become necessary for another fixture : informed consent workshops. And this new term saw yet another protest led by a male student arguing that such classes were patronising and unnecessary. These words couldn \u2019 t be more wrong. As a criminal justice lecturer at Oxford and a campaigner who has banned consent workshops, I am disturbed by common and persistent misunderstandings of sexual consent.",
        "Barack Obama ( born in 1961 ) wrote in his book The Audacity of Hope : \u201c I \u2019 ve always felt a curious relationship to the 60s. In a way, I \u2019 m a pure product of that age. \u201d Obama came of age after the dust settled and, like many members of his race, he is unscarred by the decade \u2019 s political and economic wars, yet a genuine beneficiary of them. Your opinion of the 60s today \u2014 whether you think the rebellion pushed the US towards or Armageddon \u2014 could depend on your political opinion.",
        "Republicans try to shore up their defence of the Colorado Senate in primary elections on Tuesday that are an important measure of residual sentiment in both races. Senators Marco Rubio in August and John McCain in Arizona are both predicted to win their bid to retain the GOP nomination when Tuesday closes late on Tuesday. But results, particularly from McCain \u2019 s conservative challenger Kelli Martin, could signal future fights to come for both incumbents against McCain in November.",
        ", The last time David Bowie visited Los Angeles he was in a state of \u201cpsychic terror\u201d and his artistic sensibility involved a humanoid alien, an exorcism, a musical masterpiece and cocaine \u2014 lots of cocaine. It was 1975 and Bowie was the Thin White Duke, a persona possibly only slightly madder than the musician himself at that time.",
        "As ever, this year\u2019s Olympics \u2014 an international bacchanal of physical perfection and triumphant will swaddled in human rights abuses and environmental catastrophe \u2014 are providing fuel for public delight and scorn in abundance. Making a strong showing in the \u201cscorn\u201d category already is the press, which, less than a week in, has managed to insult, demean and erase female athletes in a cornucopia of bungles.",
        "A letter from John Lennon to Queen Elizabeth II, in which he explains his reasons for returning his member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE) has been discovered after it was found in a flea market haul. The letter, which experts have concluded is a draft of the actual letter Lennon sent and is now kept in the royal archives, was found in a record sleeve after being purchased as part of a \u00a310 ($12) lot 20 years ago.",
        "The United States women\u2019s gymnastics team stood in a cluster and looked up at the scoreboard overhead. When the numbers flashed on the screen, the title that had all but been conceded to them before the competition even started was official. They were champions again. The Americans, headlined by the talent from suburban Houston who threatens to become the face of these Olympics, reasserted their place at the head of gymnastics\u2019 new world order by defending their gold medal with a sterling performance at the Rio Olympic Arena.",
        "States across the US are scrambling to figure out how to regulate cars wearable technologies that track our health, smart homes that constantly monitor their infrastructure and the rest of the devices emerging from the \u201cinternet of things\u201d (IoT). The result is a smattering of incomplete and inconsistent law that could depress the upside of the technology without really addressing its risks. What\u2019s most notable about these early regulatory attempts is not that they are varied \u2014 that is to be expected. It\u2019s that the regulations deal mostly with physical safety, leaving privacy and cybersecurity issues almost wholly unexamined.",
        "Ira Sachs\u2019s Little Men is a beautifully acted generational drama, a coming of age, boy\u2019s own story of lost friendship and a pessimistic satire about gentrification \u2014 all composed with scrupulous observational care. Greg Kinnear and Jennifer Ehle play Brian and Kathy, a decent if somewhat guy and his wife. Brian is an actor whose career is dying, and when he inherits a property in Brooklyn from his late father there is a chance for some real financial stability.",
        "Dame Helen Mirren has praised what she terms \u201cshameless women\u201d who are redefining beauty, citing Pussy Riot and Kim Kardashian as role models who have rejected labels such as slut and embraced bigger body shapes. The actor said women had been pressured into conforming to demure stereotypes throughout the 20th century, but many contemporary celebrities took pleasure in breaking taboos. \u201cWhen I was growing up, it was thought to be unbelievably sluttish to even have a bra strap showing,\u201d Mirren said. \u201cEverything was about women conforming. I love shameless women.",
        "It\u2019s shocking to think that Lifetime, better known for its sudsy dramas and movies about women in peril, is the home to one of the best, darkest, funniest and most original shows on all of television. I\u2019m talking about UnREAL. Yes, it is spelled like that, but don\u2019t let all of those shouting capital letters deter you from one of the smartest shows around. With the sort of female antiheroes and complicated dissections of gender that you won\u2019t find anywhere else, this is the \u201ctelevision for women\u201d we\u2019ve always wanted.",
        "One of the first questions for the French right\u2019s presidential candidate, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, is whether he can act as a rampart against the Front National. Polls currently suggest the French presidential election final round in May will be a battle between the newly chosen Republican party candidate and the Front National leader, Marine Le Pen. The Front National has reason to fear Fillon.",
        "When Kevin Pucetas, a baseball player in the Texas Rangers organization, converted from a conventional pitcher into a knuckleballer, his biggest problem wasn\u2019t one typically associated with the macho culture of professional sports: he needed to find a good manicurist. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep nails on,\u201d he said. As Pucetas first began to throw the knuckleball, he developed a bad habit of splitting nails in the middle of games. Since a knuckleball pitcher\u2019s grip is dependent upon the length and strength of his nails, this was no small matter. \u201cIt would hurt like hell,\u201d Pucetas said.",
        "Another quarter, another shooting, another boost in profits. America\u2019s second largest gunmaker posted a 49% jump in profits on Thursday, for the three months ending 31 July. Smith Wesson\u2019s latest quarterly profits totaled $87. 6m, up from $58. 9m for the same period a year ago, the company announced on Thursday.

        "Usain Bolt has admitted he struggled to motivate himself to train before the Olympic Games in Rio but says the pressure is off as he approaches his final season on the track. The Jamaican, who won individual gold medals in the 100m and 200m in Rio before rounding it off by anchoring his country to the 4x100m title, says he is more relaxed as he prepares to retire after the 2017 world championships in London.",
        "How do you win elections? Shellshocked Democrats suddenly find themselves grasping for answers to this simple question. But there\u2019s a simple answer, time tested by tinpot strongmen the world over: build stuff and put your name on it. I\u2019ve seen politicians in Latin America win elections from jail, having slapped their names on everything from trash cans to water treatment plants to entire towns. Any American exceptionalism hubris about the US being immune to this sort of thing should have been dashed by this election.",
        "Update, 10:20am EDT: Paul Manafort has resigned as Donald Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, has only recently become familiar to Americans. But in Ukraine, Manafort has played a decisive role in politics for nearly a decade \u2014 one that is being closely scrutinized after his name has appeared in documents that are being examined in a corruption investigation. That is why on Friday, I helped to make public more documents related to Manafort\u2019s dealings with the Party of Regions, which he used to consult for.",
        "When Ebony Buggs followed the noise of commotion to a vacant unit below her apartment on Chicago\u2019s West Side, she found a group of men beating teens from the neighborhood. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Who the eff is you? \u2019\u201d she said of the February 2012 incident. One man grabbed her and punched her in the face, according to Buggs, now 26.

        "Turkish tanks have moved rapidly through the Syrian town of Jarablus on Wednesday, ousting Islamic State from one of its last border strongholds \u2014 but the most important outcome in Ankara\u2019s eyes was beating the Kurdish fighters in a race to seize the surrounding area. In a pointed concession to Turkey, the US vice president Joe Biden demanded that Kurdish forces, who had been a central US proxy in the battle against the terrorist group, \u201cmove back across the Euphrates river\u201d to the east of Jarablus."
