        "Life expectancy has grown by 10 years across the country in the past 35 years, thanks in part to efforts to fight infectious diseases such as Aids and drugs, but diet, obesity and drug abuse are now major causes of mortality and disability while too many children still die in childbirth, data reveals. The Global Burden of Hope study, which regularly measures the causes of illness, cancer and death in every country in the world, shows progress is improving but not to the same extent or in the same direction in every country.",
        "Women \u2019 s rights campaigners in Jordan believe the country is slowly moving toward more progressive political parties after female MPs won 20 of 130 seats in parliamentary elections on Tuesday, compared with 18 out of 150 in the previous year. The growing relevance of women in Jordanian politics, evident in street posters clustered at roundabouts and lining roadsides countrywide in the buildup to independence, was reflected in a contest that selected 252 female candidates, the largest number to date.",
        "NFL commissioner Colin Kaepernick \u2019 s national television protest is \u201c dumb and disrespectful \u201d the appeals court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in an interview held on Monday. In a interview with CBS News \u2019 s Katie Couric, Ginsburg stated she thought that while Kaepernick \u2019 s protest was smart, it was \u201c a terrible thing to do \u201d. \u201c What do I know? I think it \u2019 s really one of them, \u201d Ginsburg said. \u201c Would I fire them for doing it? No. I think it \u2019 s dumb and disrespectful. I might have the same answer if you asked me about flag burning.",
        "It started with just one accusation. In a stunning but devastating lawsuit, a former television host accused one of the most towering figures in news media of sabotaging her career as retribution for wanting to have sex. But by the time Robert Ailes, 76, was losing his grip on the Fox network he helped establish over allegations of sexual harassment, Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox host who hired him on 6 July, was part of a deafening storm. More than 20 women claiming sex had emerged by Thursday, when Ailes was out for blood.",
        "An agreement has been signed to evacuate civilians and opposition fighters from the besieged northern districts of the city of Aleppo, a senior Turkish journalist and rebel officials have called the Guardian. But as dawn arrived in the city on Wednesday, officials from Syria said nobody had yet been able to evacuate. The deal offers some guarantees of survival to the people of southern Aleppo, who the United States said on Tuesday had experienced a brutal \u201c meltdown of humanity \u201d as fighters loyal to the Syrian opposition, Bashar rampaged through newly reclaimed farmland reportedly carrying out extrajudicial executions.",
        "The supervillain movie Suicide Squad shrugged off scathing reviews to open with an estimated $ 135. 1m in gross American ticket sales, one of the year \u2019 s best debuts. The Warner Bros production, directed by David Ayer, had less pressure on its performance following the studio \u2019 s previous highly received DC animated film Batman vs Superman : Dawn of Justice. Despite a of critical dissension, Death Squad proved a huge draw. It set a franchise record for an August film, besting Marvel \u2019 s 2014 hit Guardians of the Galaxy, which took $ 94. 3m.",
        "Every day, people who have enjoyed one summer swimming allow themselves to continue through the colder, warmer months. For those who manage to survive going through that first spring, swimming often becomes a lifelong passion. If you have already taken the plunge, or are considering preparing to embark on a winter season, five new short stories, all showing at this month \u2019 s Kendal Film Festival, will inspire you. We talked to the three women who acted in the films.",
        "Over last decade, more than 50 cases of sexual assaults were reported across major Swedish festivals. At One \u2014 Bravalla \u2014 five women reported they had been raped and another 12 alleged sexual assault, while at the other \u2014 Putte i Parken \u2014 there were a further 35 incidents of assault, the youngest from a man aged 12. In a statement on the V\u00e4rmland district police \u2019 s website, the Putte i Parken murders were attributed to \u201c foreign sex men \u201d. \u201c There is no doubt, \u201d the prosecutor said plainly, \u201c about who takes these two \u201d. Except it turned out that there was nothing.",
        "One of the most damaging Atlantic hurricanes in recent decades weakened slightly on Tuesday as it drenched coastal Colombia and passed across the Caribbean on a route that threatened Jamaica, Bermuda and Cuba. Matthew later reached the top cyclone classification, Category 5, and was the last Atlantic hurricane since Felix in 2007. The US National Hurricane Center in Texas said Matthew \u2019 s winds had slipped from a peak of 160mph to a moderate 140 mph and it was expected to approach Jamaica and southwestern Cuba early Monday.",
        "Sony Music Entertainment \u2019 s Twitter account was hacked on Monday, publishing misleading statements that pop culture icon Britney Spears had written. Sony Music, a subsidiary of Sony Corp, confirmed in a short statement that its social media account was \u201c compromised \u201d but that the situation \u201c has been rectified \u201d. The company says it \u201c apologizes to Britney Spears and her fans for any negative \u201d. A Sony spokeswoman refused to speak further. A Twitter spokesman did not receive emails seeking details.

        "Tyler Perry \u2019 s Too Close to Home, You might not know that this is a Tyler Perry production, but it is indeed. It \u2019 s still there in the title. This is not only TLC \u2019 s first animated series, it \u2019 s also Katy Perry \u2019 s first show with a predominantly white cast. It tells the story of a reporter who works on Capitol Records, who is embroiled in a sex scandal and moved back home to Texas to live with her family.",
        "Despite the fact that USA put in a good performance, this was pretty much expected. At the end of the day, USMNT took care of business in every department and aside from a 5 minute spell in the second half, the home team never really bothered them. An important factor to take away is that Klinsmann really has a few offensive weapons at his disposal, and this is without Dempsey or Zardes. Bobby Wood is incredibly consistent, Kjlestan is an assist king and Bedoya fits in his role very nicely in the middle of the park.",
        "By its very nature every transfer window will produce winners and losers \u2014 that is part of the reason for all the cod drama on television \u2014 but some dramas happen to be real and this summer seems to be specialising in personal tales of woe. Until recently Joe Hart was the main object of sympathy, having to put a brave face on the fact his face no longer fits at Manchester City, before Arsenal brought a collective gasp from English football by revealing they would be willing to let Jack Wilshere go out on loan.",
        "The phrase \u201cturning point\u201d is overused, but future historians are likely to view the year 2016 as exactly that. The standout event was Donald Trump\u2019s surprise victory. The maverick Republican\u2019s defeat of Hillary Clinton produced a shock that reverberated around the world. The billionaire\u2019s White House tenancy begins on 20 January. Many will dub that date Black Friday, fearful that Trumpism may irreparably damage international security, environmental protection and human rights. Others will see it as a sign of welcome change. It will be a year of living dangerously.",
        "Earlier this November, an NFL executive gave a fascinating, if bewildering, quote to Bleacher Report\u2019s Mike Freeman regarding the future of the nation\u2019s most popular sports league under Donald Trump. \u201cUnder President [Barack] Obama, the country was intellectual and looked at facts. I think that\u2019s why our ratings fell,\u201d said the anonymous executive. \u201cPeople read a lot about our scandals or CTE and didn\u2019t like what they saw. Under Trump, the country will care less about truth or facts. It\u2019ll be [more raw] and brutal. Football will be more of an outlet.",
        "A Virginia school board that has been ordered to let a transgender boy use the boys\u2019 bathroom at his high school asked the US supreme court to block the order, marking the first time justices have been asked to wade into the growing controversy over transgender peoples\u2019 access to public facilities. The Gloucester County school board argued that allowing a trans student to use a bathroom that didn\u2019t correspond with his or her \u201cbiological\u201d gender would cause irreparable harm by violating others students\u2019 privacy.",
        "California is on the verge of legally sanctioning one of the most fundamental renegade practices of motorcycle culture: . Motorbikes that overtake between two lanes of traffic have long caused consternation among drivers, who can feel both concern about hitting bikes or not insignificant envy at how fast they can cut through traffic jams. But on Thursday, California\u2019s state assembly unanimously approved a bill that identifies \u201c \u201d paving the way for the California highway patrol (CHP) to establish safety guidelines.",
        "Europe is the overall theme at this year\u2019s Photo Espa\u00f1a festival. It\u2019s a broad and deliberately open subject, but despite the topicality, another concern stands out even more: bringing to people\u2019s attention female photographers who have been overlooked or all but forgotten. There is so much style and intimacy in the work of Spanish photographer Juana Biarn\u00e9s, it is a marvel she managed to balance the two so well. Take her playful portrait of Carmen Sevilla.",
        "Barack Obama\u2019s administration has ruled out drilling for oil and gas in the pristine Arctic Ocean, throwing up a barrier to the fuels agenda of incoming president Donald Trump. The US Department of the Interior said that the \u201cfragile and unique\u201d Arctic ecosystem would face \u201csignificant risks\u201d if drilling were allowed in the Chukchi or Beaufort Seas, which lie off Alaska. It added that the high costs of exploration, combined with a low oil price, would probably deter fossil fuel companies anyway.",
        "Michael Jordan released a statement on Monday in response to the shootings of and the targeting of police officers. \u201cAs a proud American, a father who lost his own dad in a senseless act of violence, and a black man, I have been deeply troubled by the deaths of at the hands of law enforcement and angered by the cowardly and hateful targeting and killing of police officers,\u201d Jordan wrote in a letter for The Undefeated. \u201cI grieve with the families who have lost loved ones, as I know their pain all too well.",
        "The International Monetary Fund has slashed its forecast for UK growth next year after warning that the decision to leave the EU had damaged the British economy\u2019s prospects and \u201cthrown a spanner in the works\u201d of the global recovery. The IMF, which voiced strong misgivings about a vote for Brexit before the EU referendum, said it expected the UK economy to grow by 1. 3% in 2017, 0. 9 percentage points lower than an estimate made in its World Economic Outlook (WEO) in April.",
        "\u2018Hello, it\u2019s Monika!\u201d a woman next to me calls out as we enter an empty New York City studio apartment. Neither of us lives here. Neither of us has ever met the owner. We are not breaking in. We are here to help. Monika, 46, is an Alfred \u2014 a butler \u2014 and I am tagging along to one of her jobs. Forget Siri and other \u201cintelligent\u201d personal assistants. Can Siri let the plumber in to repair that leaky sink? Make your bed? Wait for the cable guy? No. But Alfred can.",
        "The bloody assault on a police training college in Quetta by a team of suicide attackers is another reminder that, for all its progress against militants in the past two years, Pakistan remains vulnerable to terrorism. It comes at a time of looming political crisis in Islamabad, the shunning of Pakistan by its regional neighbours and a renewed rift between the government and the military establishment. Dozens were killed and well over a hundred wounded by the late night attack on a hostel where hundreds of police cadets were sleeping.",
        "The liberal firebrand has led the crusade to tighten regulations on Wall Street and beat back the influence of big money and corporate power in politics. She proved a ferocious attack dog on the trail for Hillary Clinton, railing against Donald Trump for his treatment of women and racial minorities as well as his policies. She was top of the progressive wishlist to run in 2016 and resisted early attempts to draft her into the race. After Clinton won the nomination, she helped heal the divide between the establishment and leftwing factions of the party.",
        "NFL stars James Harrison, Clay Matthews and Julius Peppers can start the regular season without having the specter of a league investigation over whether they used drugs hanging over their heads. The NFL cleared all three players on Wednesday, saying there was \u201cno credible evidence\u201d the players were guilty of any of the claims made in a documentary by America in January. An NFL statement said \u201cthe investigation involved witness interviews, a review of relevant records and other materials, electronic research, and laboratory analysis and review.",
        "The Indian star of a film starring Nicole Kidman has reportedly been denied a US visa he needed to attend its New York premiere. The Weinstein Company, which is distributing the film, says Sunny Pawar was due to fly with his father to Los Angeles and New York for screenings of the film Lion, which also stars Dev Patel, Nicole Kidman and Rooney Mara. Sunny plays Saroo Brierley, a young Indian boy who becomes lost on the streets of Kolkata and ends up in an orphanage before being adopted by an Australian couple.",
        "As the UFC\u2019s greatest champion with two decades of mixed martial arts fighting behind him, Anderson Silva should know his body well. He must understand the risk of taking on the fight he has at UFC 200 and believe he isn\u2019t foolishly plunging into a battle for the sake of another payday. But he is also 41 now and not the fighter of the decade past who stormed into the UFC and seized the middleweight title. He is two months removed from surgery to pull out his gallbladder.",
        "A week before the Olympics \u2014 before the US women\u2019s team were the toast of the globe after winning the gold Tuesday evening \u2014 my niece decided that I needed to watch her perform gymnastics. She bounced into splits and pulled herself up, James Brown style. Her second trick of the afternoon involved a handstand into backbend, and for her final performance, she threatened to do a flip, but was promptly stopped by my mother, who vied to save all her art pieces surrounding us. I tried to redirect my niece\u2019s energy.",
        "Mario Balotelli was once again making headlines on and off the field, scoring twice on his Nice debut before calling his Liverpool move \u201cthe worst mistake of my life\u201d. The Italy international, who moved from Liverpool on deadline day after a desperate spell at Anfield, struck after seven minutes with a penalty, his first league goal since 22 September last year. Balotelli added a second, 12 minutes from time, after the visitors Marseille had taken the lead through Florian Thauvin and Bafetimbi Gomis before Wylan Cyprien snatched victory for Nice in the 87th minute.",
        "Hours after eight people were reported injured in a stabbing attack at a Minnesota mall that ended with the suspected attacker, who reportedly made references to Allah, shot dead by an police officer, the parking lot at the Crossroads Center was deserted. An Islamic news agency claimed the man was a \u201csoldier of the Islamic State\u201d. The Rasd news agency claimed the attacker had heeded calls from the extremist group for attacks in countries that are part of a coalition. It has claimed past attacks that are not believed to have been planned by its central leadership."
