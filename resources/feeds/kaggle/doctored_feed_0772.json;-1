Instead, he keeps tens of thousands of computers running 24 hours a day in fierce competition with others across the globe to earn bitcoins. In the world of the digital currency, it is not central banks that add new money to the system, but rather computers like Streng\u2019s which are awarded fresh bitcoins in return for processing blocks of the latest bitcoin transactions.",

Representative Corrine Brown of Florida and her chief of staff on fraud charges and other crimes, accusing them of funneling money for a bogus education charity to personal use, U.

        "Hillary Clinton disputed a scathing assessment by the Federal Bureau of Investigation that she was \u201dextremely careless\u201d with classified government secrets, saying on Friday she relied on the judgment of her subordinates at the U. S. State Department.

        "U. S. employers have been adding enough jobs over the last six months to put the economy on track to full employment by the end of this year, but that prospect alone is unlikely to get the Federal Reserve to step on the brakes with hikes. A team of researchers at the Chicago Fed, headed by Dan Aaronson, estimated in April that the U. S. economy was about a million jobs shy of the Fed\u2019s full employment goal. June\u2019s outsize jobs gain, reported Friday, lifts the average monthly jobs increase over the past 6 months to 172, 000.",
