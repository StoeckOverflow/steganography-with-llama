        "It is the strangely conspiratorial feeling of the surveillance society we think that there are unknown entities taking our data for unknown reasons. Companies and governments get into the data streams of our clients in increasingly innovative ways, tracking what we do, who we know and where we work. The methods and purposes of data collection keep quiet, with seemingly no end or beginning in sight.",
        "Zaha walked into our lives in the late 60s when my brother Peter and I were five and six. She had traveled to Beirut to study philosophy at the American University there. Our parents had just divorced, which was a relatively frequent occurrence back then. From the moment Zaha appeared, we felt welcomed and protected. She brought Zaha back with her : love, laughter, sex, music, dance and many friends who remain her life to this day.",
        "Americans appealed to a divided country and fearful world on Wednesday as President Obama and Hillary Clinton led calls to boycott the shock election of President Trump but warned of a referendum to protect constitutional rights. As final votes were tallied against all ballots, the was on track to record the highest electoral college victories of any Republican in nearly 30 years yet receive 1 % less ballots than Clinton in the general vote, behind the Republican candidate for only the second time in over a century.",
        "You \u2019 d never know, from the public face the whole party presents, that atheists are a vital and increasingly important topic. At the Democratic National Convention last week, science and religion were front and center. Clergy members gave religious addresses. Hillary Clinton avowed her Methodist faith, while her party mate, Tim Kaine, spoke about his work as a Catholic missionary in Honduras. Almost every speaker ended with the rote and obligatory \u201c God bless America \u201d. The official 2016 Republican party platform isn \u2019 t any more available.",
        "This past decade marked 16 straight weeks of high temperatures observed. The planet is hotter right now than it has been in 115, 000 years. Nasa makes very figures that show the decrease in the Greenland ice caps in the Arctic Circle, which is warming even as fast as the rest of the world. More than 90 % of the world \u2019 s climate experts say that the planet is hot and human activity is the problem. Amazingly, lots of people really don \u2019 t believe them.",
        "Had there been a male contraceptive test in 1976, I might not be here to write this. That means my mum \u2014 may she live in peace \u2014 was told by her father to come off the pill, after 12 years, because of health worries. \u201c She wrote to the doctor, \u2018 I \u2019 ll get one, \u2019 \u201d my dad recalls. \u201c And in a very little while, she was. \u201d He explains, much to my delight, that although my parents switched to condoms, I was conceived because \u201c sometimes you get reckless \u201d.",
        "Painting can be beautiful in the digital age, provided it washes out all aesthetic ambition and brings the 600 years of art created since the Renaissance to the end of a glorified selfie. That is the lesson of the internet image of Sydney artist Matthew Needham \u2019 s double portrait of himself and his daughter in their bathroom. Needham \u2019 s mediocre daub has been shared nearly a million times on Imgur. But why? It \u2019 s quite funny. She is cleaning her toilets. He is sitting on the toilet, Penguin Classic in hand. The material mercifully obscures his buttocks.",
        "This is the fifth in the Disney movie franchise about gigantic beasts lumbering onward and approaching extinction. The time has passed to call it a day. Well, the time to call it a year probably came way back in the Jurassic age of 2002, when the credits were rolling on the ( barely decent ) first season. Now it \u2019 s running on empty. We \u2019 re back with Sid the Sloth ( John Leguizamo ) Diego the Tiger ( Denis Mitchell ) and Manny the Woolly Mammoth ( Ray Romano ). Sid has romantic crises and Manny is worried about his daughter \u2019 s upcoming marriage to someone he doesn \u2019 t trust much.",
        "Some may credit the US photographer Richard Lyon for shots of outlaw criminal gangs. Others might be familiar with his photograph of Charles Sanders as a young protester at a 1962 Princeton University which surfaced during this election campaign, or Lyon \u2019 s pictures of the marches staged by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Board, which remain some of the most valuable photographic representations of the civil rights movement. This Magnum Photos work has photographed John Lennon, Muhammad Ali and Bob Dylan, and documented the industrialization of rural life in China and the deaths of homeless children in China.",
        "A bipartisan group of 158 members of Congress has accused the Trump administration of a failure of restraint over the cholera scandal in Haiti in which at least 30, 000 people have died as a consequence of an epidemic caused by the United Nations for which the world leadership refuses to accept blame. A joint letter deeply critical of US political \u2014 and devastatingly critical of the UN \u2014 has been addressed to the US secretary of defense, John Kerry, signed by 12 Republican and 146 Democratic members of Congress.",
        "Golden State Warriors star Draymond Green was arrested on Sunday for reportedly slapping a Michigan Spartans football player in the face, according to the police report. Green was charged with battery after an altercation with Jermaine Edmondson, a senior cornerback for the Spartans, outside a bar in East Detroit, Michigan. Green was hauled into jail and later released on a $ 200 bond. Green \u2019 s arraignment is set for 20 July, and if convicted, the accused player could face up to 93 days in jail and a $ 500 bond. Police officer Rick Horn wrote in his journal that at 2.",
        "Facebook also banned a Black Lives Matter activist and journalist who posted a racist email he received, raising many questions about the way the social media site censors responded. Shaun King \u2014 a criminal justice writer for the New York Daily News, who frequently writes short stories about police officers \u2014 posted on his Facebook page a screenshot of an email that twice gave him the saying \u201c FUCK YOU N * * * * *! \u201d The Facebook corporation said it was preventing him from posting for 24 hours, claiming he had violated its \u201c community service \u201d.",
        "As the red, white and blue balloons and confetti cascaded from the roof, and fireworks exploded on multiple big screens, a young boy stood in the eye of the storm. Barron Trump, 10, joined his father, Donald, and mother Melania, at the noisy, razzmatazz climax of the Republican national convention in Cleveland, his parents keeping a protective hand on him as rock music blared and the arena erupted. Donald Trump had just delivered a bilious speech that flashed warning lights for liberal America. Yes, the danger is real. This is a crossroads.",
        "Pope Francis has said it was wrong to identify Islam with violence and that social injustice and idolatry of money were among the prime causes of terrorism. \u201cI think it is not right to identity Islam with violence,\u201d he told reporters aboard the plane taking him back to Rome after a trip to Poland. \u201cThis is not right and this is not true. \u201d The pope was responding to a question about the killing on 26 July of an Roman Catholic priest during a church service in western France.",
        "Few comedians have been having as much fun with this presidential election as the host of NBC\u2019s Late Night with Seth Meyers. Meyers\u2019 sharply satirical examination of Trumpworld \u2014 A Closer Look \u2014 has established him, arguably with the exception of Alec Baldwin and Kate McKinnon as Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton on Saturday Night Live, among the political late night satirists of 2016. And with a nightly audience of 1. 5 million, he has found a distinctive political voice.",
        "In the picturesque hamlet of Brachay, in scorching late summer heat, Marine Le Pen was preaching to the politically converted. \u201cMarine, pr\u00e9sident\u201d they chanted. \u201cOn va gagner\u201d (we\u2019re going to win). A banner stretching the length of one of the stone buildings overlooking the village square read: \u201cMarine: Save France. \u201d Le Pen\u2019s stump speech was the most closely watched and significant campaign launch of la rentr\u00e9e, the national return to work after the long summer holidays, and the leader of France\u2019s Front National was welcomed like a conquering hero.",
        "Oklahoma officials have ordered 37 wastewater disposal wells shut down after a 5. earthquake struck the state on Saturday, equal to the strongest in the state\u2019s history. Governor Mary Fallin declared a state of emergency after the earthquake, which caused damage to buildings around Oklahoma and could be felt as far away as Dallas and Chicago. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to determine just how widespread\u201d the damage is, emergency management director Mark Randell said. He described it as minor to moderate, with some collapsed chimneys and fallen sandstone facing off buildings no buildings collapsed.",
        "On the eve of the first season finale of HBO\u2019s Westworld, I find myself looking ahead, past the episode right in front of me to unexplored territory. That reaction seems to be the norm with this show. Better to speculate on what\u2019s next than to luxuriate in the now. Television shows often toy with their audience by giving them only part of the ultimate picture, or swerving into unexpected storytelling territory but Westworld is unique in how committed it is to keeping its fans in the dark.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s energy agenda \u2014 which includes pledges of \u201ccomplete energy independence\u201d making coal great again and ditching the Paris climate deal \u2014 is drawing bipartisan fire from industry analysts, former members of Congress, and even one coal mogul. All of them, to varying degrees, fault the billionaire\u2019s basic premises and call his promises farfetched and at times contradictory.",
        "Because the US is the world\u2019s largest economy and trading nation, the US presidential election is a deeply consequential contest for the entire planet. This week, host Sabrina Siddiqui is joined by CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria, who explains that prominent foreign leaders are \u201cfreaking out completely\u201d over the state of the election. \u201cThis liberal world order and global stability is upheld by, at some level, the word of the United States. \u201d Later in the show, Siddiqui speaks with former ambassador Ronald E Neumann, who served under Bill Clinton and later in Bahrain and Afghanistan under George W Bush.",
        "A group of public defenders have come out in support of Aaron Persky, the judge facing a recall effort over his light sentencing of a former Stanford University swimmer who was convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman. The public defenders, led by Sajid Khan, stepped up to support Persky with an open letter and petition calling for judicial discretion that has, as of Friday afternoon, received nearly 300 signatures, most of which are from public defenders and defense attorneys.",
        "A recent news report documented the removal of two Muslim women working for the federal government from an American Airline flight. On its surface the airline staff appeared to be upholding safety regulations, but in reality they were engaging in discriminatory practices. I know this to be true because I was one of the two women. We were removed from the plane for doing nothing more than requesting water and asking why we were still aboard an idling plane for more than five hours. Although the incident was humiliating it was also .",
        "The US Drug Enforcement Agency took an unprecedented step this week that the agency says signals a substantial shift in its direction, after decades as a leader in the US war on drugs. After the DEA imposed its strictest drug regulations on a Asian plant called kratom, the outcry was strong and immediate. Many have cited the plant as an effective treatment for addiction to prescription painkillers and other opioids, while evidence of the drug\u2019s harms, they said, is minimal.",
        "In a flurry of activity on Monday, Donald Trump named three Republican politicians seemingly in contention to be named as his pick at the party\u2019s national convention in Cleveland later this month.

Trump spent time with Pence and his family on Sunday and was due to meet Ernst in New Jersey on Monday.",
        "The Monty Python team will \u201crally round\u201d Terry Jones following his dementia diagnosis, Michael Palin has said. Palin, a fellow Python and friend of Jones since they met while studying at Oxford in the early 1960s, said it was a \u201cterribly sad thing to befall anyone\u201d. Jones announced last month that he had been diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia, a form of dementia that will rob him of the power of speech. \u201cI\u2019ve known that Terry\u2019s memory was fading for a couple of years,\u201d Palin told the Radio Times.",
        "Fifty girls believed to be among the Nigerian schoolchildren kidnapped at gunpoint two years ago have appeared in a video released by Boko Haram. In the video, a masked man holding a gun tells the government that the militant group, which has murdered, raped and kidnapped thousands of people in north east Nigeria, would only release the Chibok girls in return for the release of imprisoned Boko Haram fighters. Of the 276 girls taken from their dormitories in April 2014, 217 are still missing.",
        "The Tesla chief executive, Elon Musk, has unveiled new energy products aimed at illustrating the benefits of combining his firm, which makes electric cars and batteries, with solar installer SolarCity. The billionaire entrepreneur showed off solar roof tiles that eliminate the need for traditional panels and a home battery, which Tesla calls the Powerwall, aimed at realising his vision of selling a fossil lifestyle to consumers. \u201cThis is sort of the integrated future. An electric car, a Powerwall and a solar roof.",
        "France are going through the emotional wringer at this Euro but, as far as results are concerned, they are purely elated. After another stuttering, stumbling performance that looked set for frustration, Antoine Griezmann played the role that reduced Dimitri Payet to tears in their opening game by snatching delirious victory from the jaws of a disappointing draw with a header. Not to be outdone, the little wizard from West Ham triggered an outpouring of joy with a virtuoso goal in stoppage time.",
        "Nestl\u00e9 says it has found a way of slashing the amount of sugar in some of its chocolate bars by 40% without compromising the taste. The Swiss food company, whose products include Kit Kats, Aeros and Yorkies, said it has achieved the reduction by discovering a way \u201cto structure sugar differently\u201d. The new process is said to make sugar dissolve faster so that even when less is used, the tongue perceives an identical level of sweetness.",
        "In percentage terms, how likely do you think you are to be diagnosed with cancer at some point in the future? The average rate is 50%. Would you like to move your guess up or down? Now, how likely do you think you are to suffer a domestic burglary over the next 12 months? The average rate is 3%. The extent to which you changed (or didn\u2019t change) your answers in response to the facts is a measure of your optimism. Most people are optimistic, and change their answers to give a more favourable outcome."
