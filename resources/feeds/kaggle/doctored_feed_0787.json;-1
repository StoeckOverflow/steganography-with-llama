S. nuclear policy has a chance of destabilizing the balance of terror by creating a larger arsenal of smaller weapons. Why? Smaller weapons are more tempting to use. The argument for \u201dtactical\u201d nukes is that they would destroy a smaller area and create less fallout, making them more \u201dsafe\u201d to use than traditional bombs. And that could lead to temptation to use them. Just as importantly, that could give other powers the impression that the U. S.",
