President Barack Obama told the United Nations on Tuesday.

        "Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Tuesday predicted chaos if the United States elected an isolationist president, likening the withdrawal of America from world affairs to a soccer match without a referee. Asked how he would advise Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, should he win the Nov. 8 election, Blair stopped short of labeling Trump an isolationist.

Under fire, Stumpf said he has told his managers to do \u201dwhatever it takes\u201d to make customers whole, refunding fees or compensating them for damage to their credit ratings. But he stood behind the former executive who ran the unit that oversaw many of the practices, and at times downplayed the scope of the affair.",

        "U. S. Secretary of State John Kerry demanded on Wednesday that Russia and the Syrian government immediately halt flights over Syrian battle zones, in what he called a last chance to salvage a collapsing ceasefire and find a way \u201dout of the carnage\u201d. An impassioned Kerry faced off with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at the U. N.

Relations between Kiev and Moscow have never been worse since Russia annexed Crimea more than two years ago and separatist fighters subsequently took up arms against Ukrainian government forces in the east of the country.

Senate cleared the way for a $1. 15 billion sale of tanks and other military equipment to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, defending a frequent partner in the Middle East recently subject to harsh criticism in Congress. The Senate voted 71 to 27 to kill legislation that would have stopped the sale.
