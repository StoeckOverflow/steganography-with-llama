        "We have always spoken to people who we regard as for advice on how to live \u2014 that is a truth as long as time. Mimicking the examples of characters or heroes or older women or very popular users of Instagram always feels easier than attempting to make life easier. Just look at celebrities. They have a discernible effect on the way that we live today \u2014 and one that is often shown to be negative. Sometimes, however, their impact is a good.",

The end don\u2019t matter. All that matters is what you do in between \u2014 whether you\u2019re prepared to do what it takes to make change. There has to be physical and material sacrifice.",
        "Typical Hillary Clinton, many scoffed, not telling the media for two days she was sick with pneumonia until video emerged of her nearly collapsing as she left a memorial event on Sunday.

Unlike many American cities, Pittsburgh road system is literally off the grid, its origins dating back to twisty, forest trails. Then there are the city\u2019s 446 bridges to navigate.",
        "I used to love cargo shorts. I had them in camouflage, army green and even a light khaki, all from Abercrombie Fitch. I would even wear corresponding polos with my collar popped to the sky, and maybe some obnoxious bracelets or a trucker hat. I would stuff my cellphone, which back then was still exciting and new, in the right pocket, and my wallet in the left. And then one day I stopped doing all of this. Why? Because I grew up, and because cargo shorts are a ridiculous and outdated form of \u201cfashion\u201d. This is pretty much indisputable.",

        "Imagine a side named Team America having but a handful of American citizens on its roster \u2014 and then you can begin to understand the challenges the host team faced in the Bicentennial Cup four decades ago. The tournament was created by the North American Soccer League in 1976 to celebrate the United States\u2019 200th birthday, inviting three of the world\u2019s best national teams, Brazil, Italy and England, who had won a combined six World Cups through 10 competitions.",
        "At an unmarked location in Bushwick\u2019s industrial zone on Thursday night, GHE20G0TH1K (pronounced Ghetto Gothic) has taken over.

        "\u201cSooner or later, difference scares people. \u201d The Accountant puts that sentiment in the mouth of a military man (Robert C Treveiler) explaining the tough ways of the world to his autistic, bullied son. But it could as easily be said by the director Gavin O\u2019Connor, who has put together a drama so familiar and formulaic that even the most timid viewer will be comforted. Or, more likely, anesthetized. The Accountant is committed to a pretense of difference. Its protagonist, Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) is autistic.",

        "Last night I went to see One More Time With Feeling, by accident, with Justine, the French who\u2019s been helping me taking care of Ash while I try to write songs for a new record. I\u2019ve been struggling with the mystery of how to juggle everything. I\u2019m a bit lost. I haven\u2019t written many songs in the last two years, and not only am I rusty as hell, but my body and brain have been reconfigured by parenthood. My best friend died two months before I gave birth, and I met my newborn son while ."
