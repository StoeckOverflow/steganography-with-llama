Negotiations have not been finalized and the outcome could still change, the people cautioned. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. HollyFrontier and Suncor declined to comment.",

        "Chinese steel mills are becoming cleaner every month as Beijing pushes to curb its industries. But they\u2019re not getting any leaner. Despite efforts to step up environmental checks and trim out excess capacity, steel output by the world\u2019s top producer has risen for the past seven months. As emissions cuts will mean steel mills are better able to meet stricter government standards, Beijing may find it more difficult to cut overcapacity in a sprawling industry. For now, domestic demand from infrastructure and construction has been robust, absorbing most of the extra supply.",

Ground fighting has raged largely unabated despite the truce, but air attacks on the capital, Sanaa, have stopped and there were fewer Houthi missile strikes on Saudi Arabia, residents and local officials said.",
        "U. S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton slammed rival Donald Trump on Monday for saying that the effort to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul from the control of Islamic State was going badly. \u201cHe\u2019s basically declaring defeat before the battle has even started,\u201d Clinton said at a campaign event in New Hampshire. \u201cHe\u2019s proving to the world what it means to have an unqualified commander in chief. \u201d In a tweet on Sunday, Trump, the Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election, said the \u201cattack on Mosul is turning out to be a total disaster.",

Along that border, however, Americans are more likely to call the wall a \u201dwaste of money\u201d according to a opinion poll.
