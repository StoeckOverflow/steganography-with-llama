        "The wall that President Trump has promised to install on the border may in part \u201c be some fencing \u201d the said in an update released on Sunday, as the lone Republican already in government hinted at disagreements and uncertainties for how they ought to govern together. In an interview with CBS \u2019 s 60 Minutes, Trump said \u201c there could be some fence \u201d in his proposed wall, which would span nearly 2, 000 feet and cost billions. On the campaign day he promised that the barrier could be exclusively built of \u201c poured concrete \u201d \u201c rebar \u201d and \u201c steel \u201d.",
        "Gus De Sant returns to the heavyweight competition, and returns \u2014 horribly \u2014 to a middleweight game of into which he is capable of switching so easily. He may have permanently left the more challenging and rigorous categories of movies like the Palme D \u2019 Awards, Last Days or even his poetically mysterious Gerry, about two guys lost in the jungle. This fantastically annoying and dishonest is almost always a parodic version of that movie.",
        "When Donald Trump declared his candidacy last year, most people thought it hilarious, a spillover from television into reality. Few were shouting as loudly at the Republican convention in March of this year. The unthinkable response, inexorably, became the inevitable. How could members of the Republican Party not have stopped this train train before it started? How could a demagogue of such staggering power, a man with no previous Republican affiliation, take that candidate \u2019 s nomination? The answer, of course, lies in the profound irony by which that party was already riven.",
        "It began with a familiar lyric. \u201c Type of beer that will suck you dry and then get some lunch with you, \u201d read Olivia Melville \u2019 s bio on Tinder \u2014 a brief quote, from the Canadian woman \u2019 s song with Nicki Minaj. Melville, then 23, was on the other side of Sydney from Chris Rock when he came across her computer. He posted a screenshot publicly to his YouTube page. \u201c Stay classy girl, \u201d he wrote, adding the emoji. \u201c I \u2019 m sure she \u2019 d still be hungry for dessert.",
        "Hundreds of people gathered at a mosque in Bronx, New York, on Saturday to mourn a old Bangladeshi man murdered in what they say was a grave crime. \u201c I saw my mother \u2019 s dead body four days ago, \u201d Abdul Naimul Khan, son of the late Nazma Khanam. \u201c It was very difficult for me and my family, \u201d an old Khan added. Khan was speaking at a press conference held after a prayer service at the Jamaica Muslim Center where hundreds had gathered.",
        "A week later, Colombia \u2019 s populist former President, \u00c1lvaro Uribe, appeared to be on the verge of breaking the political stage. A proposed deal with Farc rebels that he had earlier opposed was a step away from being implemented, and he hinted that he would leave his senate post before accepting that former guerrillas would soon sit next to him in parliament. \u201c My soul is not allowed to debate with criminals, \u201d he told the Colprensa news agency shortly before Sunday \u2019 s national news in which Colombians were asked to ratify the peace treaty.",
        "The UFC certified heavyweight Brock Lesnar failed a second doping test in a test taken on the night of his victory over Mark Hunt at UFC 200. The US Agency asked Lesnar last week about his possible potential violation of the FDA \u2019 s policy from an test last month. The UFC says Lesnar tested positive for the same banned substance in both tests. While the substance hasn \u2019 t been identified in accordance with Usada records, a source told ESPN that Lesnar was flagged for clomiphene, the same blocker that Jon Jones tested positive for.",
        "Ava DuVernay made an splash with Selma and her next show is television. Who \u2019 s going to say no when Oprah Winfrey comes? Created by DuVernay, Winfrey and Betty Carter based on the film of the same name, Queen Mary follows estranged sisters Elizabeth ( True Blood \u2019 s Rutina Johnson ) and Charley ( Gardner ) as they go to rural Louisiana to find the sugar plantation their mother left them. Can these women \u2019 s unhappy pasts be resolved so that they can find a match for the family business? We \u2019 re going to love finding out.",
        "A judge who investigated a complainant in a sexual assault argument why she couldn \u2019 t just keep her knees crossed should be removed from the bench, an official tasked with probing the matter has failed. In a unanimous recommendation announced on Wednesday, the inquiry committee of the Canadian Judicial Academy said Robin Hood \u201c committed misconduct \u201d while presiding over a 2014 trial into allegations of sexual assault.",
        "Andy Murray maintained his hardline stance on Maria Sharapova \u2019 s conviction for taking a dangerous substance \u2014 on the day she got her appeal against the ban handed down a week ago. Even after he advanced to the second round at Queen \u2019 s with a win over the Frenchman Nicolas Mahut, the world No2 said : \u201c My feelings haven \u2019 t changed really from earlier [ when he condemned the Russian for taking a drug test at the US Open ]. I spoke quite a lot about it then.",
        "Caitlyn Jenner \u2019 s reality talent show I Am Cait hit the chopping block earlier this week. There will be no fourth season. Social questions about their programming aside, the fine line for E! could have been that hardly anybody was watching it. After opening with 2. 7 million views, it dipped as low as 480, 000 before the channel decided to pull the plug. As I am trans and very visible, I have many conversations about being transgender, particularly with strangers.",
        "Anyone can see right into Trump Tower. In the month since Donald Trump was elected president, his namesake tower on Park Avenue has been fortified. Planes have been shot from flying overhead. People sniff the pavement out front, where two men in black masks stand holding machine guns. It looks like a zone, which makes sense, because it \u2019 s almost the president \u2019 s territory. But as hundreds of tourists and other pilgrims every day, Trump Tower is no fort, even now. No serious airport in the vicinity is as easy to enter.",
        "What does a living prisoner in the migrant camp in Kabul worry about most? Abdul is fascinated by the rats that rustle around him while he sleeps and by the difficulties involved in getting enough food, in the wake of a decision last month by the Afghan authorities to close down the camps that fed children for food. He is frightened of the local police who often spray teargas at him. Most of all he worries about his nephew, who is solely his nephew, and who is struggling to cope with their escape from violence in Afghanistan.",
        "The rain has ended, the low clouds are clearing and the wet earth of the track shines in the sharp, angled sun. Justin Kipchumba is walking, his backs and shoulders steaming as the sweat evaporates. His training for the morning is over. The has covered 30km through the fields and pastures outside the western Kenyan town of Eldoret in an hour and 45 minutes, and is heading to his rented room for tea and a plate of maize flour mash with vegetables. It is 8am. \u201cIt is like this every day. I sleep, I run, I eat.",
        "Considering the Trump HQ for Pennsylvania sits smack bang in the middle of purple territory in Conshohocken, in the outer suburbs of Philadelphia, any visitor would expect a flurry of activity so close to the election. But on Thursday morning, I find it locked at 9. 10am. Only Daniel Mills, an old from nearby Bala Cynwyd, is hanging outside. Mills delayed attending community college in order to volunteer for Trump\u2019s campaign. He treats it like a job, although his parents tell him he\u2019ll need a paid gig after the election.",
        "A simple Google image search highlighted on Twitter has been said to highlight the pervasiveness of racial bias and media profiling. \u201cThree black teenagers\u201d was a trending search on Google on Thursday after a US high school student pointed out the stark difference in results for \u201cthree black teenagers\u201d and \u201cthree white teenagers\u201d. Kabir Alli of Virginia posted a clip to Twitter of himself carrying out a straightforward search of \u201cthree black teenagers\u201d which overwhelmingly turns up prisoners\u2019 mugshots. \u201cNow let\u2019s just change the colour . ..",
        "Voters largely don\u2019t know or care about the campaign visits of presidents, according to a new study on the 2012 election that casts doubt on the benefits of the countless stops politicians make to meet Americans in diners and delis around the US. Hillary Clinton has stressed such small \u201cretail\u201d visits throughout her campaign, stopping by churches, restaurants and local events like the New York gay pride parade fitting with a traditional credo: \u201cAll politics is local.",
        "Mick Jagger appears to have named his newborn son Deveraux Octavian Basil Jagger. A photograph of the baby, Jagger\u2019s eighth child, appeared on an Instagram account under the name of Elizabeth Jagger, one of the Rolling Stones singer\u2019s other children. The caption read: \u201cMy beautiful baby brother Deveraux Octavian Basil Jagger. \u201d The picture was later removed from the account. Basil was the first name of Mick Jagger\u2019s late father, who died in 2006, although he was known to others as Joe. Octavian is Latin for \u2018born eighth\u2019.",
        "US police officers, on the front lines of gun violence every day, have particular reason to be on edge in the presence of civilians carrying guns, after 11 days in which eight officers were killed in two planned shootings. With Cleveland\u2019s law now also in the spotlight as many fear violence around the Republican national convention, the Cleveland police union went so far as to ask Governor (and former Republican presidential candidate) John Kasich to suspend the law in the immediate area of the convention. But America\u2019s law enforcement officials are not reflexively in favor of tougher gun laws.",
        "Over the years there have been certain players who have repeatedly found their way back into the national team set up, often in the face of popular opinion. DaMarcus Beasley was one such player, though he has now finally left the international scene. So, to an extent, is Kyle Beckerman. Looking ahead it\u2019s possible to see a couple of others emerging, both of whom happen to play for the same club \u2014 the appropriately hardworking, no frills Sporting KC.",
        "A mountain goat in Alaska jumped into the ocean to get away from crowds snapping its picture, and the animal drowned when it couldn\u2019t get back to land because of the crush of people on shore, troopers said. Alaska state troopers said it was imperative to give animals adequate space. That didn\u2019t happen on Saturday in downtown Seward, and troopers said in an online post that it \u201cresulted in a wild animal dying for no cause\u201d.",
        "Few lies can be told in one word, but \u201csuperfood\u201d manages it. It is such an appealing idea: that some foods are healthy, some unhealthy and some superhealthy. Why change your habits, when you can correct them by adding goji berries? Why settle for boring old good health, when chia seeds on your cereal can make you superhealthy? Little wonder that 61% of British people reported buying foods because they were supposed superfoods, according to a 2014 survey conducted by YouGov for Bupa. Of course, there is always science talk, of and glucosinolates and anthocyanins.",
        "An ancient scroll that was crushed and burned in a blaze that engulfed an entire town more than 1, 400 years ago has been digitally unfurled and identified as a copy of the book of Leviticus. Researchers made the discovery after computer scientists used a procedure called \u201cvirtual unwrapping\u201d to flatten out digital sheets of the carbonised document and read the Hebrew words originally inscribed on the parchment in AD300.",
        "Swansea City are looking for their third manager of the season after Bob Bradley was dismissed only 85 days after taking over from Francesco Guidolin. Bradley\u2019s position became untenable after the crushing home defeat against West Ham United on Boxing Day, with the woeful performance and toxic atmosphere inside the Liberty Stadium convincing the club\u2019s American owners that they had to make a change to have any chance of avoiding relegation.",
        "The attacks in Istanbul on Tuesday night came as a shock to many around the world but for a country that once prided itself as the Middle East\u2019s beacon of stability, conflict and bombings are starting to become the norm. These were Turkey\u2019s fifth major terrorist attacks in less than a year, and came amid a series of catastrophic policy failures at both home and abroad.",
        "Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump laid out their competing visions for the US economy in the past week, with varying degrees of detail and some surprising overlap. But the bulk of each speech was spent on the differences: Trump embraced more tenets of Republican orthodoxy and Clinton made pledges that progressives would be comforted to hear. Trump proposed tax cuts for all Americans, though the terms would disproportionately benefit wealthy people. The Tax Foundation found that tax revenue would fall by $2. 4 tn over the first decade, and the top 1% of Americans would make 5.",
        "Rihanna and Anne Hathaway are set to join the lineup of an Ocean\u2019s Eleven . According to Deadline, Helena Bonham Carter, Mindy Kaling and rapper and actor Awkwafina are also close to signing on to the crime comedy. Awkwafina, also known as Nora Lum, was recently seen in Bad Neighbours 2. They will join Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett, who were already attached. \u201cIt\u2019s a really good script \u2014 but I still don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be in it,\u201d Bonham Carter told Entertainment Weekly in June. \u201cBut it\u2019s a great script, and it\u2019s great for women.",
        "Columbus Day, we are told, commemorates a discovery \u2014 but of what, exactly? Not the American continent, upon which human civilisation was already flourishing before any doughty Genoan ever set boot on the Bahamas. Nor was it a new transatlantic route: Columbus was beaten to that particular punch by a Swede, several Vikings and possibly even an Irish priest named Brendan. If anything was discovered on 12 October 1492, it was Columbus himself. National treasure or arrant hooligan, we can all agree that he was, on that fateful day at least, lost.",
        "One of Donald Trump\u2019s senior advisers on national security has admitted to being baffled by the \u2019s attempts to conduct diplomacy via Twitter, saying: \u201cI can\u2019t keep up with the tweets. \u201d Former CIA director James Woolsey made the remark on Sunday morning, in an appearance on ABC\u2019s This Week.",
        "It was another epic encounter between these old rivals, featuring some of the best and worst traits of Spanish football, and when everything was done Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s top was off, his muscles were flexed and the European Cup was back in the hands of the club that likes to think of this trophy as their own possession. Real Madrid have won it 11 times now and a club with their haughty will no doubt like the fact Barcelona, Manchester United and Juventus have not even managed that amount altogether."
