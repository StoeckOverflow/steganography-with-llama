        "A kayaker captured dozens of humpback whales feasting on fish in a lagoon with the San Francisco skyline as a backdrop. Lyrinda Snyderman of Berkeley, California, stated she was out with three other kayakers to circle San Angel Island on time when the group spotted the whales. The longtime kayaker said it was the first time she had seen such wild behavior from humpbacks in San Francisco Bay, and she was thrilled by it. She noted the whales paid little attention to the kayakers as they repeatedly breached the surface to swallow up fish.",
        "\u201c The Simpsons is beautiful, \u201d the critic Matt Zoller Seitz commented, and he \u2019 s right. In many ways, it \u2019 s a more accurate portrait of the fictional, heterogeneous United States than any TV, film or play could hope to be. At more than 600 episodes and 28 shows, the scope of the show has been extended and over two weeks, the TV network FXX will air one episode of the show beginning on 7 December. We \u2019 ve picked the 25 premiere episodes of its lengthy run for your consideration.",
        "The International Paralympic Committee \u2019 s decision not to exclude Russia from the Rio Olympics was met here with relief and jubilation but also lingering anger over doping abuses that are viewed as a political assault on the country. The IOC said that rather than an ban, the 28 federations that govern major Olympic sports would review Russian sporting \u2019 records and decide who can compete in Rio next time. \u201c We \u2019 re grateful to the IOC for allowing Russian athletes into the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, \u201d the foreign minister, Vitaly Mutko, told the Russian news agency, Tass.",
        "The voice on the other end of the line, doing what they call \u201c typing \u201d had one last comment. \u201c Do you have a preference in terms of the opinion of your therapist? \u201d I paused, a little thrown by the question. I was just mechanically providing friends \u2019 advice to receive help and take advantage of free therapy courses provided by our graduate school the idea of having a choice had not entered my mind. \u201c No, \u201d I replied, trying to avoid unnecessary fussiness. My therapist turned out to be a man, and he was perfect.",
        "There is something new from fashion in 2016. It hasn \u2019 t been there in any of Alicia Vikander \u2019 s Louis Vuitton romantic, softly gowns, on the first tour of The Light Between Oceans. It wasn \u2019 t there on the evening of the Met Gala in London, which were dominated by Beyonc\u00e9 in latex. It didn \u2019 t come at Cannes, where Bella Hadid slayed all pretenders to her favorite throne in a red velvet dress with a deep waist to the waist, the smooth expanse from navel to waist accentuated by her hair.",
        "Brazil \u2019 s former house speaker Bruno Cunha has resigned in tears less than three months after he announced the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff. His departure is the biggest twist in the country \u2019 s recent political turmoil, but few are prepared to lament the reviled head of a despised institution. Cunha \u2014 an interim \u2014 had already been suspended by the Constitutional court while he is investigated for electoral corruption, intimidation of lawmakers, obstruction of justice and abuse of power.",
        "Barack Obama has claimed that drone and other airstrikes, his signature tactics of war, have killed between 64 and 116 civilians during his administration, a figure which was criticized as undercounted even before Friday \u2019 s announcement. The assessment stated that the government itself does not always reveal how many civilians it hurts and that it may revise its death tolls over time. Between 2009 and 31 December 2015, the administration claimed that it launched 473 strikes, primarily with drones, that killed between what it said were 2, 372 and 2, 581 total \u201c combatants \u201d.",

        "His presidential term suspended with respect to the survivors of the terror attacks of September 11 2001, Donald Trump maintained a studious silence on Sunday, delivering only a statement. It was a stance in direct contrast to vehement and convoluted claims he has heard about that day over the last 15 days. Immediately after the attacks, the Boston New Yorker met with a local news source who asked whether, despite his property in the financial crisis, he had learned anything about the devastation. Trump \u2019 s mind turned to his words. \u201c It was an amazing phone call, \u201d Trump replied.",
        "I \u2019 m sick of worrying about the tax on tampons being shut down by thinking that there are more important issues to worry about. Of course there are. There are always more important \u201c things \u201d to worry about. But this is \u2014 despite what you \u2019 ve been told \u2014 an issue of vital importance. An issue that illustrates in lurid detail the lack of consideration available to women \u2019 s health and wellbeing. It is, as New York governor Andrew Cuomo noted upon repealing the national sales tax on menstruation beginning last week, a \u201c violation of social and economic good \u201d.",
        "I will have some of dat green tea. \u201d Sean Paul has barely stepped over the threshold of Westlake Film Studios, located in the sprawl of Downtown Hollywood, when he politely refuses the request. Knowing of Ritchie \u2019 s love affair with Jennifer, his muse for many a club act over the years, I presume this is a way to preserve the herb. But when Ritchie his personal guard comes forward moments later, it is with a kale concoction in hand. That \u2019 s quite the transformation, I suspect. Sean Paul nods and leans back, smiling, against a grand piano.",
        "Female families detained with their children at the Berks County Residential Center in Pennsylvania said they have been on hunger strike for more than a month to challenge government claims they are released after 20 days. By the end of August at least eight families will have spent a full year in custody. \u201c On several occasions our children have complained about suicide because of the confinement and violence that is caused by being here, \u201d read a letter 22 mothers sent every week to Department of Homeland Security secretary Jeh Kim.",

        "The Pentagon has a message for its staff: Pok\u00e9mon stop. Anyone working at the Arlington, Virginia, headquarters of the US Department of Defense searching for Squirtles and Snorlaxes on the Pok\u00e9mon Go app has been told to do it outside the building, according to a memo obtained by the Washington Times.

        "Serbia has deported a group of Russians suspected of involvement in a coup plot in neighbouring Montenegro, the Guardian has learned, in the latest twist in a murky sequence of events that apparently threatened the lives of two European prime ministers. The plotters were allegedly going to dress in police uniforms to storm the Montenegrin parliament in Podgorica, shoot the prime minister, Milo \u00d0jukanovi\u0107, and install a party. The Russian fingerprints on the October plot have heightened intrigue about Moscow\u2019s ambitions in a part of Europe hitherto thought to be gravitating towards the EU\u2019s orbit.",
        "\u201cAny other star,\u201d says Guido Harari, \u201cwould have gone crazy. They\u2019d have probably thrown me out. \u201d It was 1am one night in 1989 and the Italian had been photographing Kate Bush for 15 hours. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t eaten. We weren\u2019t really talking. Just shoot, costume change, more makeup, shoot, costume change, more makeup, shoot. \u201d You worked in silence? \u201cYes. It was like we had telepathic communication. \u201d Bush had asked Harari to do the official photo shoot for her new album The Sensual World. And then, in the early hours, Harari had a bright idea.",
        "Nestled at the base of the lofty Caucasus mountain range, with the Black Sea only meters away, the Daur Akhvlediani Stadium is a picturesque location for a football match. The small venue in the resort town of Gagra offers an exotic setting for a highly unusual game: Somaliland v Sapmi. This encounter will not be found on a Fifa fixture list, nor will it be broadcast by international media conglomerates.",

        "Widowed at 34, Jackie Kennedy gave an interview to Life magazine a week after the assassination of her husband. \u201cThere\u2019ll be great presidents again,\u201d she said, \u201cbut there\u2019ll never be another Camelot again. \u201d The metaphor of King Arthur\u2019s mythical land features prominently in Jackie, a new film starring Natalie Portman that retells the 1963 shooting and its aftermath from the first lady\u2019s point of view.",
        "The head of Cleveland\u2019s police union has threatened to pull his officers from Browns games over a controversial Instagram post by Cleveland running back Isaiah Crowell. Last week, after the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, Crowell posted a picture on Instagram of a police officer\u2019s throat being slit. Crowell posted the photo before the killings of five Dallas officers last Thursday. He later removed the post and apologized.

        "I have read that it is now considered feminist to focus on a female athlete\u2019s looks. What do you think? Mark, by email, It\u2019s an Ask Hadley special, this week, folks, and the theme is \u201cLet\u2019s look at what male columnists are saying about how women look. \u201d Last week, a male sportswriter on another paper tweeted me an article he wrote a year ago about how women get feminism wrong.

        "Liberal firebrand Elizabeth Warren launched the most stinging attack yet on Donald Trump\u2019s sexism on Monday during a rally alongside Hillary Clinton. Turning an insult Trump hurled at Clinton during the last presidential debate into a rallying cry for Democratic voters, the Massachusetts senator told supporters in Manchester, New Hampshire, it was time to hang the epithet \u201cnasty woman\u201d around his neck. \u201cWomen have had it with guys like you, and nasty women have really had it with guys like you,\u201d Warren said. \u201cGet this, Donald.",
        "After the Republican National Committee used tactics and outright deception to crush an effort led by delegates to obtain a roll call vote on a rules package that didn\u2019t even directly concern the nomination of Trump, many in the media (and in the Republican party) hastened to carry Trump\u2019s water by declaring that \u201c#NeverTrump is over\u201d or \u201c#NeverTrump has been defeated\u201d. These claims show that most in the media (and in the Republican party) have not really understood #NeverTrump from the start.",
        "Donald Trump offered renewed support tonight for the use of torture while repeatedly comparing a proposed free trade agreement to rape. Trump, who has often praised the use of waterboarding as well as speaking positively about alleged war crimes committed by American troops, said at a campaign rally, \u201cWe have to fight fire with fire\u201d after referencing the penchant for beheadings by Isis. The presumptive Republican nominee claimed that while the terrorist group committed a range of atrocities including beheading and drowning prisoners, the United States was afraid to even use waterboarding.",
        "Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton\u2019s newly minted running mate, had barely taken his place at the podium in Miami when he started speaking Spanish. \u201cBienvenidos a todos en nuestro pais, porque somos Americanos todos,\u201d the senator from Virginia said. It translated to: \u201cWelcome to everyone in our country, because we are all Americans. \u201d Of Clinton, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to be compa\u00f1eros de alma [soulmates] in this great lucha [fight] ahead. \u201d A crowd of thousands had queued for hours under the sweltering sun, lines snaking around the campus of Florida International University.

        "Tiger Woods delivered a hugely encouraging performance at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas as his comeback continued on Friday. Returning after two back operations to play competitive golf for the first time since August 2015, the major winner had a mixed first day, making a superb start before some forced him to settle for a 73. Things went much more smoothly for Woods on Friday as he recorded seven birdies, including four in his last eight holes, in a round of 65.",
        "Nasa slowly inflated a new experimental room at the International Space Station on Saturday, with better luck than on the first try two days earlier. Astronaut Jeffrey Williams opened a valve and introduced 22 seconds\u2019 worth of air into the compartment, then several more seconds in brief bursts. Mission Control reported noticeable growth in the structure, the first of its kind for space fliers. The Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, or Beam, barely expanded during Thursday\u2019s inflation attempt. Experts believe the compartment was packed up tight for so long before last month\u2019s launch that the fabric layers had trouble unfolding.",
        "Donald Trump may be struggling to capture a majority of voters in the heartland of America, but there is one eastern European precinct he would likely carry in a landslide \u2014 if only they were allowed to vote in US elections. The town of Veles, Macedonia (population 44, 000) is the unlikely home for dozens of avowedly political news sites, featuring headlines like Hillary\u2019s Illegal Email Just Killed Its First American Spy and This is How Liberals Destroyed America, This Is Why We Need Trump in the White House.",
        "Yahoo last year secretly built a custom software program to search all of its customers\u2019 incoming emails for specific information at the request of US intelligence officials, according to a report.
