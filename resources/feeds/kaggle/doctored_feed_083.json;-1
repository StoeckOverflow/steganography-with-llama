        "Like most millennials, I actively oppose Donald Trump and will not vote for him in the upcoming elections. That doesn \u2019 t mean, though, that I \u2019 d ever vote for any other Trump. Trump and even some Democrats touched on the praise for Ivanka Trump after her speech at the Republican national conventions in Cleveland. She \u2014 and the rest of the younger Trump kids \u2014 stole the show throughout the campaign. Ivanka in particular has all her father \u2019 s \u201c pros \u201d and almost none of his incredibly cons. She has blended motherhood with owning her own company.",
        "In an advertisement voiced by Hollywood director Christopher Daniels, actors Taraji K. Henson, Bryshere Gray, Trai Byers, Jussie Smollett, Tasha Smith, Gabourey Sidibe and Mike Byers encourage their fans to audition for the Democratic presidential candidate in November. The Trump administration has released a statement praising the White House for the recent enaction of the Paris Agreement intended to address climate change, calling the accord which president Barack Obama today called \u201c the best first shot to save the little planet we \u2019 ve got \u201d a \u201c world deal \u201d that will cost the American economy trillions of dollars.",
        "The SP 500 sat at a record high on Tuesday as stock markets around the world rebounded from recent depression caused by global warming following Britain \u2019 s decision to leave the European Union. The SP index opened up 7. 26 points, or 0. 3 % to 2, 137. 16 topping its earlier record of 2, 132. 80 set on 21 December 2015.

        "An eventually overwhelming win for Manchester continued, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic scoring both goals \u2014 the game a thrilling, cavemanic header. Paul Pogba excelled as the match progressed and topped his class with some penetrating tackle and cocky passing. Southampton had more of the play and should not be remotely discouraged by their opponents, the thought of which will keep their ground warm for at least 10 hours of their home. Thanks for your great goodnight. 90 + 3 min In the last minutes of added time, Pogba spanks outside of the near post from 18 feet after fine play from Mkhitaryan.",
        "1 Ignore it Every episode goes through blips, but you were so busy with research and made so many suggestions for your partner \u2019 s behaviour that you began to notice the bad ones were stretching into months and maybe even years. Anyway, turn it round : since it is good to give your friend the benefit of the doubt later, it is important to listen to your feelings, too. One of my central mantras for helping people lead a long life is : what is this feeling required to tell me? If you keep getting anxious, there might be a better reason.",
        "I \u2019 ve got several writing places. There \u2019 s a garden, next to the vegetable garden, which is a lovely place to work but I can get uptight about the pigeons and squirrels. I tend to leave things in there that don \u2019 t need any use because you can \u2019 t keep many animals in a shed or they go away. It \u2019 s powered by solar energy, which I fitted myself, and heated by a large gas heater. More often, however, I write in my library, which has thousands of books.",
        "The Texas court of criminal appeals on death halted an execution date for next week of a person convicted as an accomplice to a murder he did not commit in a case that raised concerns about how the state applies the death penalty. Jeffery Wood, 43, was ordered to be executed on 24August by lethal injection. He was convicted of taking part in a 1996 convenience store fire during which clerk Kriss Keeran was fatally shot.",
        "One of the largest earthquakes in Oklahoma \u2019 s history shook the state on Tuesday morning, and was felt by ships from Nebraska to North Dakota. The 5. earthquake happened at 7. 02am in Missouri, the United States Geological Survey said. No serious damage was immediately expected, though video shows cracks slicing through the sides of cars and bricks falling. The USGS estimated the quake was relatively shallow, about six miles deep, and easily felt over a wide area. The agency also concluded that aftershocks were likely.",
        "The NFL announced it is reviewing domestic violence allegations against Dallas Texans rookie Ezekiel Elliott. A separate report says Elliott denied allegations that he raped his girlfriend early Friday in Columbus, Ohio, received bruises and abrasions. The report said he wasn \u2019 t arrested because of conflicting reports of what happened. Three suspects told police they didn \u2019 t hear Elliott assault the woman. Elliott says the girl got the bruises and abrasions in a gun fight. On Friday, Ashley Thompson, who has been romantically linked to Elliott, posted photos on Instagram of injuries she said were the result of domestic violence.",
        "Three Army service members have been injured outside a military hospital in southern Jordan, in an exchange of gunfire with Jordanian military troops. The deaths of the men \u2014 all combat trainers working for the US government \u2014 was confirmed by US officials although results remain unclear.

        "The emails currently roiling the US presidential race are part of some unknown secret collection amassed by the troublesome Paul Weiner, but if your purpose is to understand the clique of individuals who dominate Washington DC, the emails that really leak are the ones being slowly erased by WikiLeaks from the hacked account of Hillary Clinton \u2019 s campaign chair Jim Podesta.",
        "I see the envy in people\u2019s eyes when I tell them where I live. My constant travel to countries, regions and continents far removed from the daily commute of suburban England. I come back, flash my suntan around, talk casually of dignitaries met, and post bland Facebook updates of trips to exotic places. And it is wonderful. But, of course, the opposite is also true: for every beach paradise I can also show you an isolated, Groundhog Day played out in suffocating humidity. The cocktail parties, the flagged cars, the endless small talk.",
        "The federal government is proposing a ban on swimming with dolphins in Hawaii \u2014 a move that may crush the dreams of many tourists, but will allow the marine mammals to finally get a good day\u2019s sleep. The proposed rule would bar people from swimming or approaching within 50 yards of the Hawaiian spinner dolphin. The dolphins are an increasingly popular attraction for tourists, who pay for chartered tours of the bays the dolphins frequent.",
        "You know that friend of yours who will literally die if she eats any gluten? Turns out she probably won\u2019t. A new study has just confirmed what many of us have long suspected: the majority of people who feel the need to eliminate gluten from their diet don\u2019t appear to have any medical reason for doing so. Over the past few years gluten has gone from being an unassuming composite of storage proteins to the biggest supervillain in the culinary world.",
        "I meet Claudia Rankine, the poet and author of 2014\u2019s National Book Citizen: An American Lyric, on the roof of her Manhattan apartment building. It\u2019s a sunny day, about a week after it was announced that she had received a MacArthur \u201cgenius grant\u201d and the clouds and the planes heading to LaGuardia airport seem so close, it feels as though we could reach out and touch them.",
        "A Texas man will attempt to become the first person to swim across the Pacific Ocean next year, after almost five years of setbacks. Benoit Lecomte, 49, revealed his intentions at the University of Texas at Austin on Thursday. He says he will set off from Tokyo in April 2017 and \u2014 conditions and sharks willing \u2014 arrive in San Francisco five to six months later. He hopes the swim will raise awareness of environmental issues. It is the third time in under five years that Lecomte has announced he plans to swim the Pacific.",
        "A ceasefire across Syria appeared to be holding on Friday as its brokers, Russia and Turkey, sought support at the UN security council for the plan it hopes will trump failed peace proposals and end the conflict. Despite violations blamed on both sides in parts of the country, there were no reported civilian casualties by Friday night and diplomats were hopeful that the fragile truce would take root, despite all other attempts failing.",
        "A twentysomething woman living at home prepares for a day out. Her parents tease her as she fixes her hair. Is it a date? No, just a work associate, a Harvard law student with the firm for the summer, taking her to a community meeting to discuss \u201cbroken faucets and underfunded schools\u201d. Across town a man in an undershirt chats with his grandmother by telephone cigarettes and says, \u201cyes, her skin is of the darker persuasion. \u201d This is how Barack met Michelle, and Southside With You will detail, in rather exaggerated, form, how they fell in love.",
        "Precariousness is not just a thing. In recent interviews, dozens of academics and schoolteachers, administrators, librarians, journalists and even coders have told me they too are falling prey to an unstable new America. I\u2019ve started to think of this group as the Middle Precariat. The word Precariat was popularized five or so year ago to describe a rapidly expanding working class with unstable, jobs. What I call the Middle Precariat, in contrast, are supposed to be properly, comfortably middle class, but it\u2019s not quite working out this way.",
        "Elderly revolutionaries joined young doctors, famous musicians, government workers and former guerrilla fighters in Havana\u2019s Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n as thousands lined up to pay their last respects to Fidel Castro. Some carried flags. A few had flowers. All came with memories of the guerrilla leader who overthrew a dictatorship, resisted a invasion, faced down a nuclear superpower and dominated the island\u2019s political life for half a century. At the start of the official commemorations, Orlando G\u00f3mez had come with his wife to bid farewell to his old comrade in arms.",
        "North Korea responded to the defection of a prominent diplomat and his family last week with typical hyperbole and inconsistency. First, a spokesman for the government\u2019s Ministry of Truth told newspapers that Thae had been a victim of a South Korean plot. The incident, the official said, was a \u201ctypical operation of South Korean intelligence services and part of a plot to bring down North Korea. \u201d But the next day, a different story emerged. The North Korean government was now accusing Thae of raping minors and stealing state money.",
        "The night of 2 April 1990 is one Tina Condos will never forget. It was the opening night of Donald Trump\u2019s new $1. 1bn Atlantic City casino, and Condos was working as a cocktail waitress serving drinks to Michael Jackson, Elle Macpherson and the other stars and socialites who had flown in for the big night. Lit by $16m worth of chandeliers, Trump described the casino, then the most expensive ever built, as the \u201ceighth wonder of the world\u201d. The property tycoon now turned presidential candidate also promised it would transform the fortunes of the New Jersey coastal city.",
        "If you thought your day was ruined by the unexpected use of the phrase \u201c Donald Trump\u201d just imagine being a South Park writer: they had to rewrite their election night episode at the last minute because it initially featured a Clinton win. Though South Park had episodes in 2000 and 2004, the 2008 election episode was completed after the results were in. In 2012, they captured the results correctly but completed the episode in advance \u2014 which, apparently, had been the plan for this year\u2019s episode, necessitating the new scenes.",
        "Happy New Year, guys \u2014 that last one was crazy. A lot happened, much of which we might like to forget. But it is said that in order to imagine the future we must remember the past. So grab a bottle, and let\u2019s sing Auld Lang Syne to the heroes and the heroic casualties of 2016. To Michelle and Barack Obama, two living angels.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s core supporters may back his views on curbing immigration \u2014 but they disagree with him over global trade and US involvement in Nato, an opinion poll has found. Trump has made opposition to the Partnership (TPP) trade deal between the US and Asia a central theme of his populist campaign, but more of his base favour it (49%) than oppose it (46%) according to the 2016 Chicago Council on Global Affairs survey.",
        "Prison officials have sentenced Chelsea Manning to 14 days in solitary confinement following an attempt to kill herself in July. Manning is serving 35 years in Fort Leavenworth prison in Kansas for leaking a vast collection of secret US government documents about the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Government officials drew the public\u2019s ire after charging Manning with three counts of misconduct following the suicide attempt, including two which carried possible penalties of indefinite solitary confinement.

        "The Holocaust survivor and Nobel peace laureate Elie Wiesel has died aged 87 at his home in Manhattan. His friend Menachem Rosensaft and Israeli Yad Veshem research center confirmed the death on Saturday. \u201cMy father raised his voice to presidents and prime ministers when he felt issues on the world stage demanded action,\u201d his son, Elisha Wiesel, said in a statement. \u201cBut those who knew him in private life had the pleasure of experiencing a gentle and devout man who was always interested in others, and whose quiet voice moved them to better themselves.",
        "After years of delay, thousands of indigenous Canadians who were forcibly removed from their homes as children are finally getting their day in court. An Ontario superior court judge will on Tuesday hear arguments in a summary judgment motion for a lawsuit brought against the Canadian federal government by survivors of the episode, known as the \u201cSixties Scoop\u201d.

        "At the beginning of this year it was announced that Muhammad Ali planned to visit the UK for the first time in three years, to attend the I Am the Greatest exhibition in his honour at the O2 centre in London. Davis Miller, the of the exhibition, said at the time that Ali wouldn\u2019t consider making the trip to anywhere else in the world. \u201cHe connects with the people in the UK,\u201d said Miller. \u201cHe connects with the Brits. \u201d For once it wasn\u2019t mere hype. Ali did indeed enjoy a special relationship with Britain.",
