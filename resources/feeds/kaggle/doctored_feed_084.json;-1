In a statement posted to Congress on Friday, Cruz says : \u201c After many months of deep consideration, of prayer and questioning my own conscience, I have decided that on Independence Day, I will vote for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump. \u201c I \u2019 ve made this decision for two reasons. First, last year, I promised to support the Republican nominee. And I decided to keep my word.",
        "How do you describe the texture and texture of a prawn? Sort of rubbery elastic, really. Like chicken, only thinner. These unappetising phrases hardly understand what makes it so good \u2014 the exact reason why prawns ( called salmon in the United States ) are one of the most consumed seafoods globally. But now biotech startup Big Wave Foods is on a quest to mimic the exact taste and taste of a prawn, in a product made entirely out of algae and plant ingredients. The small, whorls they \u2019 ve made look uncannily like the whole thing. But what do they taste like?",
        "Some refugees have already left. But not to go where they chose : not across the Channel to Dover, which they believed would offer sanctuary. Instead, they have continued along the French coastline, others south towards Paris and some down towards England. As dawn breaks over mainland France on Monday, negotiations will begin at the sprawling estate on the outskirts of Calais, home to up to 10, 000 refugees, including an estimated 1, 300 lone children. Sixty trains are scheduled to arrive to carry away 3, 000 people, delivering them to accommodation centres throughout France.",
        "Ireland \u2019 s cosy relationship with Silicon Valley has been put into question after the European Union slapped Apple with a whopping $ 14. 6bn annual bill. The commission recommended the \u201c sweetheart \u201d tax deal Ireland made with Apple between 1991 and 2015 allowed the tech companies to avoid tax on virtually all profits from sales of its product across the EU \u2019 s total market, booking the sale in Ireland rather than the city where the product was sold.",
        "Tesla Motors tells the US Senate aviation committee staff it is considered two theories that would explain what led to the 7 August fatal crash that killed a Florida man who was monitoring the car \u2019 s Autopilot system, a man familiar with the meeting told Reuters on Friday. Tesla staff also told congressional aides at a briefing on crash that they are still trying to solve the \u201c system failure \u201d that led to the crash, the source stated.",
        "Fran\u00e7ois Hollande \u2019 s decision not to stand for a second time, the first time since the war that a French candidate has not bid for was greeted with a mix of admiration and scorn by the country \u2019 s political \u2014 and stinging criticism of his regime. In Germany, the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung argued that Hollande \u2019 s campaign recalled the fate of two other social democratic \u201c changers \u201d Tony Blair and Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, both of whom once lived through painful structural reforms that ran counter to their former \u2019 instincts and were abandoned by government as a consequence.",
        "Daniela can \u2019 t imagine anything without her. Since she joined Colombia \u2019 s largest militant group nearly a decade ago at the age of 15, the small assault rifle has been her sole companion. But negotiators from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( Farc ) and the administration of President Juan Manuel Santos appear to be within touching distance of a lifetime to end more than half a year of war, and now Daniela is being forced to contemplate war as a civilian.",
        "In the US, they may call them \u201c freedom panties \u201d which sounds terrible. In the South Devon village of Stokeinteignhead, they are described as Rozamund Perrin \u2019 s controversial smalls. The retired casting director is at odds with her prudish part in the latest skirmish in a global economy on washing lines. \u201c It is quite inappropiate [ sic ] for this type of product to be displayed opposite the nearest primary school, \u201d writes an anonymous note running through Perrin \u2019 s letterbox with the offending knickers. \u201c There are member [ sic ] of this society that would welcome a halting of this.",
        "Records are allowed to be broken, but stereotypes can get a bit more stubborn. The women of the United States \u2019 Paralympic team managed to make a mockery of both at the Rio Games. Male athletes were responsible for 61 of the 121 medals stockpiled by Team USA in Brazil, marking the second ever Summer Olympics where they participated with more silverware than their male counterparts.",
        "The guy passing through the US airport entry gate looks like a successful financial advisor, nice glasses, borderline fake cool. The security man lifts his bag from the floor. \u201c Is this yours? \u201d she barks. He confirms it is. \u201c You got a knife in here? \u201d He asks if she means a folded butter knife \u2014 kind of some airline cutlery he carries on airline trips, for when he brews up a pot noodle sandwich at night up in some godforsaken motel. She grabs the butter knife and throws it in a bin.",
        "The recent eviction letters that Laura Hernandez and her mother received at their apartment in Spring Valley did not say why they were being let out. But executives at Trion Properties, a private equity firm that recently purchased their building, have made it unusually clear that they employ a different kind of job \u2014 technology workers at the national headquarters of Facebook, which is also a large campus address. In Hernandez \u2019 s building in Redwood City, many residents dealing with eviction are Latino families.",
        "Jennifer Lawrence has drawn scathing criticism for an anecdote she ran on the BBC, about disrespecting local children while shooting in Hawaii. In a recent interview, Lawrence broke a story about \u201c \u2019 \u201d on rocks that are considered sacred to native Hawaiians, while shooting The Hunger Games : Catching Fire in 2012. \u201c There were \u2026 sacred \u2026 rocks \u2014 I dunno, they were sacred, who knows \u2014 they were sacred, \u201d said Lawrence. \u201c And you \u2019 re not supposed to fire on them, because you \u2019 re not supposed to expose your genitalia to them.",
        "An explosive wildfire has claimed two lives, scorched around 100 structures and forced hundreds to flee in central Oregon. Residents described several scenes on Friday as they struggled to escape flames and smoke in the foothills of Kern County, about 42 miles of Bakersfield.

In a decision on Friday, US district judge Thelton Henderson in San Francisco said the California plaintiffs may seek damages for fraud and false advertising from Starbucks Corp in their proposed nationwide class action. According to the lawsuit Starbucks is skimping on one of a latte\u2019s main ingredients: milk. \u201cA latte is a coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk,\u201d the lawsuit claims, explaining that caff\u00e8 latte is Italian for \u201cmilk coffee\u201d.",

        "Four men wearing stripes take their seats at a table. They have only a split second to brace themselves before a bull charges through the gate, flinging them into the air amid cheers from the crowd. When the dust settles, both the bull and the men return to their cages. This is the Angola Prison Rodeo, a tradition at the biggest and most notorious prison in Louisiana, the incarceration capital of the world. The prison rodeo is a distinctly American spin on the Roman Colosseum, and Angola\u2019s is the last remaining show in the country.",

        "You can have the turkey. Just give me the gravy. And I\u2019ll have the chipolatas and bacon rolls too, the cranberry sauce and the stuffing. At Christmas dinner, it is the accompaniments that interest me as much as, or even more than, the big bird. The chewy, scrunchy savoury bits that are traditionally part of the feast can be sublime either on the side or served as dish in their own right. The Christmas accompaniments can be served in the classic manner or can be touched by a little imagination \u2014 either way, they are my favourite bits.",
        "These are still early days but already there is the unmistakable feeling Manchester United are on their way back and anxious to make up for lost time. They have suffered more in the last few years than they will probably wish to remember but Jos\u00e9 Mourinho could be seen saluting the crowd in triumph after this victory. Zlatan Ibrahimovic has two more goals for his personal collection while Paul Pogba, the world\u2019s most expensive footballer, came out of his homecoming with a sunrise of a smile.",
        "Colin Kaepernick has hit back at Donald Trump\u2019s assertion that the quarterback \u201cshould find another country that works better for him\u201d in response to his decision to kneel for the national anthem.

        "Japan will develop a new missile as part of plans to beef up its defence of remote southern islands, as tensions with China increase over the disputed territory, a report said Sunday. The two countries are locked in a dispute over the uninhabited islets known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China.

Now there is \u201cfake news\u201d said to be behind the election of Donald Trump as US president and a recent incident involving a gunman at a Washington pizzeria. The term has become widely used \u2014 too widely. But it\u2019s understandable there\u2019s confusion when some fake news is only a bit fake, or fake for an arguably legitimate reason (such as satire). Can we still make a useful definition of fake news?",
        "Monkeys have been observed producing sharp stone flakes that closely resemble the earliest known tools made by our ancient relatives, proving that this ability is not uniquely human. Previously, modifying stones to create fragments was thought to be an activity confined to hominins, the family including early humans and their more primitive cousins. The latest observations this view, showing that monkeys unintentionally produce almost identical artefacts simply by smashing stones together.",
        "Heidelberg Street is an unexpected hub for art. The quiet stretch situated just east of downtown Detroit, in an area crowded with dilapidated housing and empty lots reclaimed by nature, draws an estimated 270, 000 people a year. The whimsical creation of Detroit artist Tyree Guyton, the site dubbed the Heidelberg Project has rejuvenated the surrounding neighborhood, in a way that is probably only possible in Detroit: Guyton took ordinary found items \u2014 old toys, appliances, clothes \u2014 and turned the surrounding streetscape into a art project. \u201cI had no plans,\u201d he told People magazine in 1988.",
        "An erupting volcano in Hawaii was all smiles last week \u2014 and no, it wasn\u2019t a Disney animation. The lava of Kilauea, a shield volcano on Hawaii\u2019s biggest island, appeared to form a smiley face as it erupted. The volcano has been active since 1983, with lava emerging from the Pu\u2018u \u2018O\u2018o vent. As the smile appeared, lava from the volcano reached the Pacific Ocean for the first time in three years, according to CNN.

        "The story of Alicia Machado is many things but as it pertains to the presidential election, it is a story about the time Donald Trump smeared a woman and riled up a media circus to spread the gossip. That was back in the 1990s and mostly fodder for tabloids. Now it\u2019s happening all over again \u2014 only as part of a presidential campaign. In the first candidates\u2019 debate this week, Hillary Clinton invoked her opponent\u2019s of Machado after she was crowned Miss Universe in 1996, comments that pushed her into a downward spiral of eating disorders for five years.",
        "Public Enemy\u2019s Chuck D has never pulled his punches. Since the group\u2019s debut album Yo! Bum Rush The Show was released 30 years ago, the group has addressed social injustice and written songs that have provided the soundtrack to protest and resistance around the world. He\u2019s stayed active for the better part of three decades and built a career on telling truths, often loudly. Not just in his music, but his writings, speeches and university lecture series.",

In April, the company revealed that Parrish herself had undergone \u201cthe first gene therapy successful against human ageing\u201d. The treatment, it claimed, had reversed the biological age of her immune cells by 20 years. \u201cThere are a lot of fantastic conclusions that [people] can jump to,\u201d says Parrish \u2014 \u201cdefeating death, or people becoming immortal, or things like that.",
        "We\u2019re going to wrap up our coverage for the day. Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: An update now to that last block: Uki Go\u00f1i in Buenos Aires has spoken with Macri spokesman Iv\u00e1n Pavlovsky who said that the Argentinian president did not speak about Trump real estate developments with Ivanka Trump, either. \u201cHe spoke with Ivanka only briefly, to say hello, because he met her when she was just a kid. They did not speak about it. The president doesn\u2019t speak about city building permits,\u201d Pavlovsky told the Guardian."
