        "The European Central Bank will extend its already generous asset buys on Thursday, aiming to boost stubbornly weak price growth, but with much of its firepower exhausted it may also debate sending a token signal about the eventual end of such purchases. Emphasizing abundant risk, including from elections in potentially four of the euro zone\u2019s five biggest economies, ECB President Mario Draghi is expected to argue that premature tapering or slowly ending could abort a still timid recovery, unraveling the impact of the buys. The unprecedented effort has already consumed 1. 4 trillion euros ($1. 5 trillion).",
