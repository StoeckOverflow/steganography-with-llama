        "When your friends and relatives regard you as The Political Voice, seismic news events are a bittersweet delight. For every political catastrophe this year has thrown our way, I have received messages and phone calls from family and friends thinking that I might have some special purpose, some furtive piece of knowledge that will stop things and assure them it will be fine. In the chaotic aftermath of Brexit, many friends contacted me \u2014 some of whom I hadn \u2019 t known for years \u2014 asking what they would do to make things right.",
        "The company operating a controversial pipeline site near native tribal land in North Dakota has vowed to press back, despite the plan sparking anger across the world on protests. Protests are taking place in the Americas, Europe, Japan and New Zealand over the $ 3. 8bn Dakota Creek Pipeline, which the Standing Rock Sioux tribe claims protected their water supply and tribal heritage. Rallies have taken place in cities including New York City, Los Angeles and London, where an envelope was dangled in front of the Palace of Versailles.",
        "President Bashar \u2019 s forces have tightened their siege of Moscow, after another 24 hours of intense bombardment that left dozens dead and nearly 2 km without water. The United Nations security forces is due to meet at 11am on Saturday to discuss the escalation of fighting in Syria, diplomats said, at the request of the Americans, Britain and France. A wave of bombs has been dropped on the ground since Thursday when Assad, together with his Russian backers, abandoned a tentative ceasefire and government forces began a new assault on the city that was Syria \u2019 s largest before the attacks.",
        "We launched our 2016 humanitarian appeal less than a fortnight later with a plea for solidarity with Syrian refugees : that however damaged we may be by the volatility of world hunger in an extraordinary year, we should not face the suffering of desperate migrants forced from their homes by famine and persecution. I am proud and proud that Guardian and Observer media in their thousands have responded with tremendous generosity.",
        "The prosecutor in the Stanford sexual assault prosecution is pushing to make homosexuality a mandatory punishment for students who attack unconscious individuals, proposing legislation driven by the global outrage at the mass sentencing of former student Scott Turner. The Santa Clara County district judge \u2019 s office \u2014 which prosecuted the former Stanford swimmer, who was accused of sexually assaulting an unconscious man on campus \u2014 announced on Monday a new bill that would prevent judges from allowing defendants like Turner to avoid prison.",
        "Facebook will suffer from a mistake it made by deleting a former Vietnam war photograph of a naked girl fleeing a napalm attack, said Sheryl Sandberg, the group \u2019 s chief operating officer. The photograph was removed from public accounts on Friday, including that of the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, on the grounds that it violated Denmark \u2019 s restrictions on nudity. It was reinstated after Solberg accused Facebook of censorship and of criminal history.",
        "Ohio has moved one step closer to outlawing bestiality after a bill banning sexual abuse of animals passed the state legislature. It is also legal to have sex with children in nine US states, plus Washington DC. John Kasich, Ohio \u2019 s president, will now decide whether to pass the bill, which also prohibits the abuse of animals for sex. The law is the result of a lengthy lawsuit by the Humane Society of the United States, an animal welfare group which is aiming to ban bestiality nationwide.",
        "\u2018 We will catch you. On top of a hefty fine, a criminal prosecution and a year \u2019 s driving license, we will also provide you with a parting gift of playing the driver \u2019 s copy of Nickelback in the cruiser on the way to jail. \u201d This is how cops in Edmonton, on Prince Edward Island, Canada, are disincentivising drunk driving this Christmas \u2014 by threatening them with a blast of Chad Kroeger \u2019 s band \u2019 s 2001 rock album Silver Hands Up, according to their Facebook page. They \u2019 re not even the first police force to engage in these Chadist gang crimes.",
        "A hot fan \u2019 s faulty wiring ignited one of America \u2019 s most destructive wildfires, a blaze that killed four people, tied four firefighters to the hospital and destroyed more than 1, 300 homes every year, officials reported on Wednesday. The California department of forestry and fire safety released a detailed inquiry into the cause of the wildfire that devastated a large portion of rural Ventura County and parts of Napa County about 90 miles north of San Francisco in September 2015.",
        "As a medical student, I remember reading stories about the early days of the HIV epidemic and wondering what it was like for doctors to take care of patients who had a new, deadly disease. It seemed to me like it would be frightening for both nurses and doctors alike. I didn \u2019 t feel that early in my career as an I would be caught in the middle of another new disease called \u2014 Zika. Most people who catch this disease feel fine.",
        "Fears for how Trump \u2019 s agenda will unfold have spurred activists to start organizing aggressively and creatively for his presidency, from starting classes for teachers to calling on people to fly to swing states. Trump \u2019 s campaign was always particularly light on policy matters, but that hasn \u2019 t stopped progressives from preparing for the polls. Here \u2019 s a list of the solutions people are coming up with : John from San Francisco, who asked for his campaign not be to used, has started writing lists of people with alternate bedrooms and undocumented immigrants in hundreds of safe houses in case mass deportations begin.",
        "Take four major male actors, surround them with wild and sexy bros, throw in some obstacles and plenty of crazy high jinks and, voil\u00e0, you have a Judd Apatow movie. However, the new Apatow effort, with Michael Bonfiglio, adds all those ingredients and subverts every obstacle : Doc Darryl is an annual 30 for 30 documentary debuting on Thursday. It is a sobering look at the parallel paths ahead and the different roads toward salvation taken by two of baseball \u2019 s biggest players of the 1980s, New York Mets Dwight Gooden and Darryl Strawberry.",
        "Jesse later found out the hard way what happens when a robotic carpet cleaner encounters a pet turd, and it isn \u2019 t pretty. Newton \u2019 s Roomba is supposed to clean the living room of his home in Little Rock, Arkansas, at 1. 30am each day, so that the house wakes up to a clean house. That all changed this month when his wife Evie had an accident on the rug during the cleaning, leading to what he described as the \u201c poopocalypse \u201d.",
        "A Republican senator struggling in his race made a racially charged remark about his Democratic opponent in a debate on Thursday night. Illinois senator Mark Kirk seemed to suggest the Asian American heritage of congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq war veteran, somehow diminished her family\u2019s long service to the US. \u201cI had forgotten your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington,\u201d Kirk said of Duckworth. The congresswoman, who was born in Thailand, is the daughter of a Thai woman of Chinese descent and an American father who traced his roots to the Revolutionary War.",
        "A gloomy group of men and women watch in silence as a truckload of armed soldiers slowly drive past the basketball court where they are living in makeshift plastic shelters. This encampment in Caluco, a small town 40 miles west of the capital, San Salvador, is home to about 70 people from a nearby farming community, forced to flee their homes after a recent escalation of gang violence. It is El Salvador\u2019s first camp for internally displaced people since the civil war, when an estimated one million people were forcibly displaced and 80, 000 killed.",
        "Being a Hollywood sequel, Now You See Me 2 of course comes supersized. It\u2019s significantly longer than its predecessor, running over two hours. The first film took a short detour to Paris, but otherwise stayed in the States Now You See Me 2 jumps from America, to China (in an obvious effort to court the Asian market) and finally to England. The plot boasts higher stakes. Its melee of characters has grown to include a hammy new villain, played by Daniel Radcliffe. And Woody Harrelson is back, playing not one, but two characters \u2026 they\u2019re twins.",
        "That banging sound you heard were the last nails being hammered into the coffin of the Trump campaign. Or it might have been the thumping of Donald Trump as he stalked the debate stage. Either way, the Republican nominee treated the notion of a contrite, humble performance with all the subtlety of a subway train. Not for him was the usual shame we associate with someone caught in a moment of sleaze. He prowled around Hillary Clinton, looming behind her when she approached the undecided voters in the audience. He hugged himself and hooked his hands in his belt.",
        "Kelly Fremon Craig\u2019s Edge of Seventeen premieres this week, a fresh entry in an enduring genre: the film. In movies as in real life, these stories are awkward, tender, tragic, triumphant, surreal, nightmarish, funny \u2014 sometimes all at once. Their magic lies in the insight they can offer, how universal and unifying they are no matter the details of the narratives, their time and place. Here are the essentials. Everyone\u2019s favorite movie about an awkward young man doing unspeakable things to an apple pie to a soundtrack almost entirely dedicated to .",
        "The Obama administration has announced the relaxation of rules and restrictions for US citizens who travel to Cuba, and it held some very good news for cigar and rum aficionados. Cuban rum and cigars, which were strictly illegal in the US during the embargo of the island nation can now be brought back to the US by travelers in the same quantities that would be allowed from other countries. The change is a result of an executive order signed by Barack Obama, who is accelerating efforts to normalize relationships between the two countries before he leaves office in January.",
        "Two Indian police constables have been accused by fellow mountaineers of using crudely manipulated photographs to support their claim to have reached the top of Mount Everest. The husband and wife pair from Pune were hailed as the first Indian couple to have conquered the world\u2019s highest peak on 23 May. But eight other mountaineers have now lodged a complaint saying Dinesh Rathod and his wife Tarakeshwari never made it to the summit and had \u201cmorphed\u201d photographs of themselves at the top. The couple have reportedly denied the claims.",
        "The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) on Friday defended USA Gymnastics against criticism it turned a blind eye to sexual abuse and said it had no plans to conduct an investigation itself. In their opening news briefing of the Games, the USOC leadership faced questions about a report in the Indianapolis Star on Thursday that said top USA Gymnastics officials failed to alert authorities to allegations of sexual abuse by coaches. Reuters has not independently verified the report.",
        "The father of Ahmed Mohamed, the Muslim teenager arrested in Texas last year when he brought a homemade clock to school, has launched a defamation lawsuit against several conservative media figures and organisations. Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed filed the suit last week in Dallas County on behalf of his son, whose detention and questioning last September made international headlines amid accusations of Islamophobia. He was suspended from school for three days, though police decided not to charge him with making a fake bomb.",
        "Wayne Rooney says he will not play for any other English club bar Manchester United, discounting the possibility of a move back to Everton, after being given a ringing endorsement from his new manager, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, and the encouragement to continue chasing down Sir Bobby Charlton\u2019s scoring record at Old Trafford. Mourinho\u2019s description of Rooney as the outstanding English footballer of his generation \u2014 \u201cWayne is, and has been, England\u2019s best player for over a decade\u201d \u2014 is a reminder why the Portuguese tried to sign the striker early in his second spell of managing Chelsea.",
        "Bill Broun says he\u2019s \u201cweirded out\u201d when we speak just before the publication of his debut novel, Night of the Animals. It\u2019s the day after the Brexit vote, and it\u2019s not the standard novelist jitters that have him rattled. As his publisher is happy to point out, Brexit is a turn of events foretold by his expansive dystopian novel, set in London in 2052. I am weirded out too, I tell him. The experience of reading his novel so soon after the vote felt a little unnerving.",
        "Lawyers for Melania Trump are pursuing legal action against the Daily Mail for reporting \u201c100% false\u201d rumors that she worked as an escort in the 1990s as well as raising questions about her immigration status at the time. While Donald Trump has a reputation for threatening and pursuing litigation, it is unusual for a major party nominee or their spouse to mount legal action against a publication only months before an election.",
        "There\u2019s no getting around it now. The major storyline of the 2016 NFL season at the midway point is this: the NFL is bad. Even one of the league\u2019s paid PR flacks tacitly acknowledged the negative feeling around the product by tweeting out a \u201cnarrative\u201d hashtag after Week 8 happened to deliver a handful of entertaining games. So while we all can admit the NFL hasn\u2019t been good this season, it also isn\u2019t all bad. Even the darkest clouds have silver linings, right?",
        "The coalition fighting Islamic State in Syria has killed at least 300 civilians in airstrikes, and must do more to prevent further civilian deaths as the battle for Mosul intensifies in neighbouring Iraq, Amnesty International has warned. More than half of the victims identified in a new report by the rights group, which looked at deaths over the two years since western forces joined the fight against Isis in Syria, were killed during the fight for the city of Manbij.",
        "The Royal Canadian Mounted Police has formally apologised and earmarked C$100m ($76m) for payouts to hundreds of current and former female officers who were subject to sexual harassment and discrimination, in hopes of turning the page on a troubling chapter that has rocked one of Canada\u2019s most iconic institutions. \u201cFor many of our women, this discrimination and harassment has hurt them mentally and physically,\u201d said Bob Paulson, the RCMP commissioner on Thursday. \u201cYou came to the RCMP wanting to personally contribute to your community and we failed you. We hurt you. For that, I\u2019m truly sorry.",
        "When Janet Yellen sits down with her colleagues on the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest committee this week, another slice of her credibility will be on the line. America\u2019s recovery since the financial crash has not followed the path it was supposed to. The central bank\u2019s constant dithering over whether to raise interest rates has made it appear weak and unable to influence events. In the seven years of what, in many economics textbooks, would be considered a strong recovery, the Fed has raised rates just once \u2014 by a point to 0. 5% in December last year.",
        "Prolific TV showrunner Ryan Murphy recently compared American Horror Story to The Twilight Zone. What seems like a ridiculous juxtaposition is actually one of the more reasonable things the creator has said recently: the shows are more similar than they appear. American Horror Story is, perhaps, the most visible show in the genre that The Twilight Zone has exemplified for decades: the anthology."
