        "In the last century, America lost two pioneering transgender professional entertainers : Alexis Arquette and The Lady Chablis. Both died relatively young, Arquette at 47 and Chablis at 59. Then again, maybe that \u2019 s actually rather sad, given the world they were born into : although there \u2019 s no good data on life expectancies for trans and disabled people in the United States, the statistics we do have suggest that they face greater health rates with fewer resources than their cisgender counterparts, and that they are therefore more likely to grow younger as well.",
        "There are cockroaches inside the lockers at Central Park middle school in Las Vegas, so Ana Pi\u00f1eiro, 13, carries her lunchbox, violin and school backpack with her all day long. She attends classes under windows that leak during rainstorms. And on hot afternoons, classes is often canceled because the air conditioning has broken down. Victoria told Nevada lawmakers this at an Internet forum in April 2015, asking them to prioritize funding for a state library system ranked sixth last in the nation.",
        "Long before Bob Dylan was awarded the Nobel prize in literature, pundits began to talk about \u201c Dylan versus Keats \u201d as if you had to choose, and as if Dylan \u2019 s bizarre transformations of folk literature are really so different from what John Keats does in his eerie ballad Le Belle Dame sans Merci. When it comes to Dylan \u2019 s art, the dice fall differently. Dylan versus John Wayne would make no sense, for when it comes to drawing and sculpture it \u2019 s as plain as a Brooklyn ice cream parlour that Bob Dylan is a bluff old traditionalist.",
        "The Hungarian foreign minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has failed to convince a majority of his members to vote in a referendum on opening the door to refugees, ruling the result invalid and undermining his prospects for a cultural within the European Union. More than 98 % of participants in November \u2019 s referendum sided with Orb\u00e1n by arguing against the admission of refugees to Europe, allowing him to claim an \u201c outstanding \u201d victory. But more than half of the population stayed at home, making the process constitutionally null and void. Orb\u00e1n himself put a positive mark on the low turnout.",
        "A federal injunction in Texas has blocked two US school districts for accommodating transgender students, stirring up a legal battle with the White House that may soon head to the supreme courts. As millions of American teens prepared to return for the following academic year, Mary O \u2019 Connor, a district superintendent in Forth Worth, issued the first injunction late on Monday night to prevent US schools from being forced to allow equal access to bathrooms and toilet facilities.",
        "Well, that \u2019 s it as far as the medals are concerned on day one, so we \u2019 re going to clear things up. A flurry of golds in the evening fireworks, and congratulations to Sarah Storey on winning her 12th straight gold. Lots more to say tomorrow \u2014 we \u2019 ll be sure to keep you up to date with the action. Andrew Mullen finished third in the S5 200m freestyle, but was full of admiration for the reigning champion. He told BBC 4 : \u201c Daniel Dias is a great coach. I look up to him because he \u2019 s done a lot for the sport.",
        "Barack Obama has permanently banned commercial oil and gas industry in most waters in the Arctic and northern oceans, a effort to assist in environmental protections before he hands over to President Trump. Obama supports a 1953 law that allows companies to block the sale of private offshore drilling and production rights and makes it legal for their successors to reverse the ban.",
        "In October 2015 the government of Sri Lanka adopted with the US, a resolution on international reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka, which was passed at the 30th session of the UN Human Rights Council. Nevertheless, this very same government has since been backsliding from keeping its own commitments, promises and recommendations made at the UNHRC. In contradiction to the adopted resolution, which called for international assistance, including that of international organisations to investigate wartime conditions during the final stages of the war, Sri Lanka has consistently insisted on setting up a parliament.",
        "Saturday \u2019 s Triple H programming at San Diego was a curious mix of looking forward and blinking an eye backwards. The Warner Bros and Marvel Studios took the convention by storm, with bombastic panels previewing cinematic slates. Justice League, Wonder Woman, Pink Panther, and the rest all have exactly a few months ( or years ) before they \u2019 re released.",
        "For Jules Verne it was the poet who keeps us busy. For Edgar Allan Poe so many little slices of history. But though the reason we live a third of our lives awake has so far resisted full explanation, research into the effects of sleepless nights on brain tissue has shed fresh light on the mystery and also offered intriguing clues to alternative treatments for depression. In a book published on Tuesday, experts show for the first time that sleep resets the steady of activity in the human brain which take place in our waking lives.",
        "Fox Sports founder Roger Ailes \u2014 one of the most influential men in the broadcast media landscape \u2014 prides himself on being a writer. In 2004, he stood up for Fox News anchorman Bill O \u2019 Reilly when O \u2019 Reilly \u2019 s former producer brought a lawsuit with lurid details of alleged sexual harassment. With Ailes \u2019 fired, O \u2019 Reilly settled the lawsuit and kept his job. This year, O \u2019 Reilly, along with other Ailes loyalists, returned the favor and spoke out to remove his embattled boss who was trying to strike down a sexual harassment investigation by former Fox anchor Gretchen Carlson.",
        "For Levi Brinegar, high atop his mountain, a mountain can feel like the rest of the world. Clouds swallow the clouds, winds howl and lightning blazes. \u201c The cabin shakes. During the last moment the windows cracked. The window was 50 feet away. It was like strobe lighting going off. It was dangerous. \u201d Brinegar, 26, endures this, and more, for $ 12 an hour. He could not be happier. He reckons he has the best job in the country. \u201c It \u2019 s fun. I \u2019 ll definitely need to get back next year. \u201d Brinegar is a fire lookout for the Colorado Forest Service.",
        "Airbnb blocked a former professor from using its website after he uncovered evidence of racial discrimination, prompting criticism that the startup \u2019 s policies stifle critical discussion. After the Guardian contacted Airbnb about the death of Ben Edelman, an associate professor at Harvard Business School, a spokesman said it had leaked his account. Emails show that Edelman, who is one of the most prominent researchers involved in the debate about racism on Airbnb, was fired because he had created test results to study how black people face higher rates of rejection than white people.",
        "This was one of those occasions when what had initially appeared an unnecessarily risky team selection ended up feeling more like a masterstroke. Arsenal were overrun for long periods in Paris but still departed buoyed by the point pilfered from their trickiest tie of the section, and with David Ospina\u2019s reputation as enhanced as Edinson Cavani\u2019s was wrecked. The locals are growing used to their Uruguayan\u2019s profligacy. Ospina, in contrast, has rarely asserted such a positive influence on his own team\u2019s display.",
        "The most peculiar thing about Belgium\u2019s status as the best team in the world, which is how Fifa classed them between October and April (when they were leapfrogged by Argentina) is that they achieved it without beating anyone really strong in a competitive match or even regularly looking like a team, at least not one familiar with the notion of synergy. That is why they are not many people\u2019s favourites to be crowned European champions even though Fifa still has them pegged as the continent\u2019s top side.",
        "When WhatsApp, the messaging app, launched in 2009, it struck me as one of the most interesting innovations I\u2019d seen in ages \u2014 for two reasons. The first was that it seemed beautifully designed from the outset: it was clean, minimalist and efficient and, secondly, it had a business model that did not depend on advertising. Instead, users got a year free, after which they paid a modest annual subscription.",
        "The Broadway musical sensation Hamilton is heading to the West End and is set to open at the Victoria Palace Theatre in October 2017. Such is the demand for the show on Broadway, with tickets for the best seats now priced at an astronomical $849 each, that it may soon be more economical for New Yorkers to fly to London and see the show there \u2014 especially if the pound plunges .",
        "The Mexican tennis player Daniel Garza has been banned for six months and given a $5, 000 (\u00a34, 060) fine after being found guilty of a charge. The Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU) found Garza had \u201cattempted to influence the outcome\u201d of a match at the ITF USA Futures 11 tournament in Calabasas, California in March of this year. Garza did not play in the tournament but no further details were given.",
        "Back when I was a university undergraduate in Ye Olde England, my dorm room had an Ikea lamp, lots of pretentious books and a pretentious vintage rock band poster. There was also a mushroom growing from my ceiling (not on purpose). This was pretty standard and my peers had variations of the same. Fast forward to America and things have changed. I present as Exhibit A, Lindy Goodson and Abby Bozeman, freshman roommates at Ole Miss. A picture of Goodson and Bozeman\u2019s dorm room recently went viral because, unlike dorm rooms of yore, their room is really, really nice.",
        "Law enforcement officials arrested 141 people in North Dakota after police surrounded protesters, deploying pepper spray and armored vehicles in order to clear hundreds of Native American activists and supporters from land owned by an oil pipeline company. The move marked the beginning of an aggressive new phase in ongoing police efforts to thwart a demonstration by hundreds of members of more than 90 Native American tribes to prevent the construction of the controversial Dakota Access pipeline, which they say would threaten the regional water supply and destroy sacred sites.",
        "In my exploration of \u201cfake news\u201d I\u2019ve found some troubling things. And it\u2019s not just the rightwing news network that\u2019s worrying. I\u2019ve recently gone back and taken a preliminary look at the leftwing media ecosystem, trying to map the hyperlinks between these sites \u2014 so I\u2019m not trying to establish causation or assign blame as to what kinds of content these sites circulate. There are plenty of other people willing to do that. What I\u2019m really looking for is a way forward.",
        "Vice News Tonight, When we think of the nightly news, we think of Tom Brokaw or some other dude reading about everything that is wrong with the world and ending with a sweet human interest story about a woman who gets arrested to cross it off her bucket list or some nonsense. Vice is trying to change all that, bringing the same globetrotting gonzo sensibility to the evening news that it does to its weekly program. It\u2019s still unclear exactly what the format is going to be, but there certainly won\u2019t be a Tom Brokaw type.",
        "Whatever Wells Fargo is selling, Congress is not buying it. \u201cYour bank was turned into a school for scoundrels,\u201d New York congresswoman Carolyn Maloney told the chief executive, John Stumpf, at his second grilling in Washington in as many weeks. Stumpf was quizzed by the House financial committee for over four hours on Thursday about his staff opening two million unauthorized accounts in order to meet sales quotas imposed by the bank. The hearing followed an equally contentious one in the Senate last week.",
        "Labor unions and law enforcement officials have condemned Donald Trump\u2019s \u201ccruel and baffling\u201d nomination of fast food executive Andrew Puzder for labor secretary on Thursday. \u201cTrump has once again shown how he is with what working Americans need,\u201d said Service Employees International Union (SEIU) head Mary Kay Henry, calling the appointment \u201c extremism\u201d. Trump hurts \u201cworking families, including those who elected him\u201d with the nomination, she wrote on behalf of the union. Their comments come as allegations of spousal abuse against Puzder have resurfaced, which may further complicate his nomination.",
        "It\u2019s four years since Frank Ocean\u2019s last album, Channel Orange, and 13 months since he promised the Boys Don\u2019t Cry, would be released. In an era when many major artists are prolific \u2014 such as Drake \u2014 or ubiquitous \u2014 Rihanna, Beyonc\u00e9 \u2014 the New artist has taken his time and kept a low profile. Beyond a handful of guest vocal appearances, an a capella track on Kanye West\u2019s The Life of Pablo, a sketch of song called Memrise and an appearance in a Calvin Klein ad, very little has been seen or heard from Ocean.",
        "NBA star Derrick Rose testified on Friday in a $21. 5m lawsuit accusing him and two friends of raping his saying he interpreted a text message from the woman as consent to have sex with her later that night. The suit claims that the three men came to her apartment after an evening of drinking at Rose\u2019s Beverly Hills mansion, and raped her while she was incapacitated.",
        "Donald Trump shook free the last vestiges of political supervision on Wednesday with the appointment of a maverick new campaign chief likely to favour his freewheeling style. Steve Bannon, a Breitbart News executive once described by Bloomberg as the \u201cmost dangerous political operative in America\u201d will wrestle control of the campaign from current chairman Paul Manafort. \u201cI am committed to doing whatever it takes to win this election,\u201d said Trump in a statement confirming the reshuffle.",
        "Donald Trump has risked further inflaming US relations with China, after he used Twitter on Saturday to accuse China of an \u201cunpresidented [sic] act\u201d in its seizing of an unmanned American submarine this week. \u201cChina steals United States Navy research drone in international waters \u2014 rips it out of water and takes it to China in unpresidented act,\u201d Trump said, misspelling \u201cunprecedented\u201d. The tweet was later reissued with the correct spelling of \u201cunprecedented\u201d. The tweet containing the error was deleted.",
        "Thanks for following tonight\u2019s liveblog on this very bad night for Cubs fans. There\u2019s very little positive spin to put on this right now for Chicago. Even if they win tomorrow, they still have to then win two games in Cleveland and one of those against Corey Kluber. But the Cubs won 103 games this year. Three more isn\u2019t necessarily a huge ask. It just happens to be against a team as good as the Indians. We\u2019ll see you back here again tomorrow night for a possible championship by the Cleveland Indians.",
        "The writer and humorist Garrison Keillor served up a bittersweet farewell for 18, 000 fans at the Hollywood Bowl on Friday, as he hosted his final episode of the radio variety show, A Prairie Home Companion. Keillor\u2019s swan song was not markedly different from most of his nearly 42 years of Companion episodes, offering a rich mix of Americana music and often comedy. Barack Obama did, however, call in for a special segment recorded earlier on Friday, but that will not be heard until Saturday\u2019s broadcast."
