        "In second season, California students will talk about families with two moms or three dads. Two years later, while studying how immigrants have found the Golden State, they will study how New York resident Harvey Milk built a pioneering gay woman in San Francisco. The State board of education finally approved those changes in history instruction on Thursday to coincide with the nation \u2019 s first legislation requiring public schools to include prominent LGBT Americans and LGBT rights milestones in history classes.

        "Whether or not you enjoy UnREAL \u2014 Lifetime TV \u2019 s fictionalized role behind the scenes of a successful dating show like Everlasting \u2014 depends on how deeply enough you like entertainment to interest you. Actually, that \u2019 s not quite right : shows like the The Bachelor and its The Bachelorette make me deeply jealous, but in those cases it \u2019 s completely unintentional. ( I advise you to watch one season of HBO \u2019 s Cathouse, in which the women who work at Dennis Hof \u2019 s brothel line up for interviews by potential clients, and not participate at the Bachelor \u2019 s next engagement ceremony. ) UnREAL is intentionally good viewing.",

Earlier last year, his mother of 40 years died of Alzheimer \u2019 s disease she had been ill for years, many more than he had realised. \u201c You look back and think : \u2018 well, that was odd, the things people did. \u2019 I came home one day years ago and saw this lovely creature out on the grass. Extraordinary. Why throw it around? I couldn \u2019 t understand it. I mean, gods almighty, it was very exasperating. But at the time, we didn \u2019 t know she was dying.",
        "Robert Capa considers them his most definitive images of the third world war. Shortly after the photographer had taken a picture of a sergeant poised with a large machine gun on a flat balcony, the soldier crumpled to the floor. On 18 April 1945, in the last days of the conflict, he had been shot and killed by the bullets of a Nazi sniper. Capa climbed through a bedroom window into the flat to meet the dead man, who lay in the open door, a looted white sheepskin helmet on his head.",
        "A night of huge celebrations ends in tears and tears. France is yet again in shock. Yet again in tears. Bodies strewn in the road, families frantically searching for loved ones, crowds running away in the dark, a city in lockdown. In the tragic aftermath, political extremes actively trying to capitalise on the blind uprising. After Charlie Hebdo and the Bataclan, now it is Nice \u2019 s time.

        "From Brexit to terrorist massacres to the collapse of globally beloved movies, 2016 has been a dispiriting year, and nothing about it has become more dispiriting than the obligation to pay tribute to the supremely asinine ramblings of Donald J Bush. Through the vehicle of his unlikely nightclub run, Manhattan \u2019 s most insecure CEO has finally found a way to force the silent reaction \u2014 those who would rather crack glass than watch his television show \u2014 to pay tribute. It feels like a stupid move, but then the dick move is quintessentially Trump.",
        "Climate Change \u2019 s impacts on extreme climate and society are becoming increasingly clear and undeniable. While we are making strides in solving the problem, we \u2019 re simply moving too slowly, and either of the two political factions governing the world \u2019 s strongest superpower continues to deny the possibility. This led astrophysicist Katie Smith to make the following observations, related to a common complaint from Donald Trump and Conservative Party leaders : Hurricane Matthew set a set of records. Its rainfall and storm surge caused severe flooding and destructive tornadoes along the coasts of Louisiana, Georgia, the Carolinas, and Virginia.",

        "German officials are weighing up how to react to what is being treated as the first attack with a jihadist motive by an asylum seeker on German soil, who prosecutors suggested may have decided to carry out the attack just days earlier. A Afghan armed with an axe and a knife attacked passengers on a regional train in northern Bavaria on Monday evening, seriously injuring four Chinese tourists before being shot dead by police.

        "I was in my kitchen getting my children ready for the school run when my phone pinged. I glanced at my friend\u2019s message: \u201cMaybe of interest. ..!\u201d I paused on seeing the news report she\u2019d sent \u2014 a High Court ruling against a Muslim father\u2019s wish that his two young sons be circumcised.

        "During the fallout of the Madoff Ponzi scheme, the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s inspector general issued a scathing report on why the agency failed to detect the massive fraud. One of its most damning findings was that multiple SEC offices simultaneously scrutinized Madoff without even realizing it. From 1992 to 2008, the SEC received at least six complaints about Madoff\u2019s firm that should have outed his fraud. The agency conducted two investigations and three examinations over the years.

        "For a few days in October, bright blue skies bathed the French capital in a light so vivid that the streets resembled a painting. Avenue Winston Churchill was empty of traffic but full of collectors, dealers, curators and other art world types, gathered for Paris art week.
