He \u2019 s allowed four runs in those games. Incredible. Is there a star pitcher in baseball? It \u2019 s certainly Bumgarner \u2019 s sixth career pitching start without allowing a run, matching Joe Glavine for most ever.

        "Much like Donald Trump \u2019 s candidacy for president, preparations for his inauguration on 20 January have been unorthodox. One major sticking point, especially headlines in the music press and beyond, is which artists Trump and his team can convince to vote for the polarizing incoming president. Thus the inauguration, once a hallowed gig, has included a poisoned chalice, according to some. \u201c It should come as no surprise that Trump \u2019 s staff is struggling to find entertainers for the presidency, \u201d notes the industry consultant and freelance music analyst Steven J Horowitz.",

There\u2019s just not enough time in the day to consume every TV show. Then there\u2019s the shows that you not only won\u2019t watch, but you literally can\u2019t watch.
