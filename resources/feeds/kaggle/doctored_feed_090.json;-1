        "We are wrapping up our global eclipse coverage now \u2014 Thank you for reading and for sharing video and images. You can read our history of today \u2019 s events here : As the solar period drew to an end, Kate Lamb reported this report from Jakarta : As a solar eclipse arched across the skies of Indonesia this afternoon, thousands donned their rectangular eye glasses and gazed upwards, hoping for a glimpse of the mysterious natural phenomenon. Crowds started to form at the observatory in South Jakarta as early as 3 a. m.",
        "Google employees have proposed a new generation of emojis aimed at promoting gender equality in the workplace, including cartoon female scientists, chemists, plumbers and farmers. The Google Group presented the designs of 13 new emojis on Tuesday at the Unicode Consortium, a Silicon Valley group that heads an \u201c emoji subcommittee \u201d overseeing the creation of new emojis. \u201c No matter where you look, women are gaining visibility and awareness as never before, \u201d the four Google workers wrote in their blogs.",
        "A woman who was captured and held captive for five weeks after leaving her native California home to jog was kept safe on the side of a desert road bound in restraints, a deputy sheriff said later. Authorities were looking for two dead women they believe abducted Sherri Papini, 34, on 2 November, Shasta County Commissioner Tom Bosenko said in an interview on Good Morning America. Papini was found around 4. 30am on Friday morning near Route 5 and was able to flag down a vehicle, Bosenko said.",
        "The next words of Bernie Sanders \u2019 political revolution had not begun before it started to unravel. Just days before Wednesday \u2019 s birth of Our Revolution, an organisation which hoped to build on the momentum of the month \u2019 s Democratic primary campaign, more than half of its staff quit. This was not a case of a few volunteers since they didn \u2019 t have the time to work towards a revolution. This was core team members in key position deciding Our Revolution was doomed to failure. Eight activists quit \u2014 from a staff of 15. The new organising department disappeared.",
        "At a cost of $ 1bn to maintain a chill in the air during Texas Rangers games, it would surely go down as the future world \u2019 s most expensive building. Voters in the city that is home to the Rangers go to the polls on Tuesday to decide whether to build a new Major League Baseball stadium that would replace a popular venue that is barely two years old.",
        "Some fans and critics complained about Game of Thrones \u2019 fourth season, which wrapped up on cough. They said that it was bloated, sagged in the middle, and was full of needless plots that didn \u2019 t really lead anywhere ( cough, the Battle of Riverrun, cough ). However, the series went out on a high with the last episode Battle of the Bastards, where Jon Snow finally squared off with Ramsay Bolton, and finally the gorgeous Winds of Winter, which may be the finest hour ( and ninety minutes! ) of the entire show.",
        "A federal appeals court has upheld a previous law requiring candidates to show photo identification at the polls, rejecting a protest from Democrats who argued that it required voting by minorities and LGBT people. A panel of the fifth US circuit courts of appeals ruled on appeal that the law did not violate the Voting Rights Act or impose an unnecessary burden on the right to vote.",
        "As Verizon gobbles up ailing tech giant Yahoo for $ 4. 8bn, the prognosis for site Flickr becomes unclear. In an age of Instagram and hipster blogs, it \u2019 s easy to forget that Flickr continues to be hands down the best file sharing tool on the web, with loads of features and a thriving, vibrant community of professional and amateur photographers. It offers a social, celebratory environment with easy storage in an era long before Picasa, Dropbox and iCloud. \u201c In the early days it was fun.",
        "If the gender politics surrounding modernist icon Georgia O \u2019 Keeffe has begun to peter out, due to a new exhibition at Tate Modern, then it might seem jarring to look at her clothes. But her stark, stark, androgynous style was typical of a woman who was ahead of her time not only in art but also in architecture. Minimalism and flats have been the C\u00e9line template for a fashion. Calvin Klein, too. Even Victoria Beckham has dipped her hair in, with all three designers making clear references to the \u2018 feminist \u2019 designer.",
        "In April 2002, le Pen stunned all of France by defeating the socialist leader, Lionel Jospin, in the first round of the French presidential election, and advancing to the final match between the top two parties. Terrified by the prospect of a victory, the extreme left \u2014 including Communists, Greens and the Socialist Left \u2014 threw their support toward the incumbent president, Jacques Chirac, a pillar of the establishment who had served as mayor of Paris for 18 months before becoming president in 1995.",
        "The New York Times has issued a warning after its television writer panned a script for being confusing when he watched the last two episodes in the original order. Mike Harris, the Times \u2019 television reporter, had criticised the \u201c split personality \u201d and \u201c needlessly complicated structure \u201d of the four episodes of Amazon \u2019 s American legal drama Goliath. The noirish screenplay is by David E Kelley \u2014 the producer behind Street Legal and Ally McBeal \u2014 and starring Billy Bob Thornton as Billy McBride, a prosecutor.",
        "\u201c I mean, Jack, I have brilliantly \u2014 I have brilliantly used those laws. \u201d \u2014 3 million, Pueblo, Colorado, William J Trump did not update his 1995 returns, portions of which made a $ 916m loss that could have let the businessman avoid 18 percent of taxes. Jack Mitnick was Trump \u2019 s accountant at the time. This month, Mitnick was asked by CNN if Trump \u201c was brilliant in the way he designed the tax code? brilliant and a genius? \u201d \u201c No, those returns were actually created by us, \u201d Mitnick said.",
        "The writing team behind Atlanta created one of fall\u2019s shows and managed to squeeze in storylines about drug tests, baby urine and a transracial teenager called Harrison. Jamal Olori, Stephen Glover and Stefani Robinson, along with Donald Glover and Fam Udeorji, wrote Atlanta and they discussed some of the inspirations behind the show and where its most talked about moments came from. Stephen Glover: I remember when we turned in the script to FX and they emailed Donald back and said: \u201cIs Justin Bieber actually going to be in this?\u201d Jamal Olori: We just started laughing so hard.",
        "It may be Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk who most often invites comparison to Marvel\u2019s superhero Iron Man \u2014 the alter ego of billionaire inventor Tony Stark \u2014 but it is Mark Zuckerberg who might be the first to bring Stark\u2019s technology to life. Memorably, the Facebook CEO sets himself annual goals such as learning Mandarin in 2010, eating only meat from animals he killed himself in 2011, or reading two books a month in 2015. In January, the Facebook founder said that his 2016 challenge would be to build an artificial personal assistant for his home.",
        "The leader of a cult French disco band has been detained in Moscow following a plagiarism dispute with a Russian pop star who recently made the news speaking about his long friendship with US Donald Trump. Didier Marouani, who founded the band Space in 1977, was detained with his Russian representative Igor Trunov in a bank in downtown Moscow on Tuesday evening, state news agency TASS reported. The agency later published a photograph of the Frenchman inside the bank, scratching his head with a bemused look on his face.",
        "\u201cInhale all the love the universe has to offer,\u201d Lloyd Jones told a group of high school students at the beginning of second period. \u201cExhale anything that doesn\u2019t benefit you. \u201d A student wearing an ROTC shirt sat, legs crossed, eyes closed, breathing, his fingers touching in a Buddhist mudra, or hand gesture. He was surrounded by 10 other students, all black and Latino, in a room given over to the Mindful Moment program. All the other students at Patterson high school in Baltimore were doing something similar.",
        "A new memorial for the victims of the 1966 University of Texas tower massacre is etched with a word Latin professors say constitutes an embarrassing mistake that is literally set in stone. The granite memorial unveiled this week honors victims on the 50th anniversary of sniper Charles Whitman climbing to the top of the clock tower and opening fire. Seventeen deaths were ultimately attributed to Whitman, and the names of the dead are etched on the stone monument below the Latin word \u201cINTERFECTUM\u201d which is equivalent in English to \u201ckilled\u201d.",
        "In any other year, a story like \u201cPizzagate\u201d would get you laughed out of the room. The conspiracy theory claiming that Hillary Clinton was part of an underground trafficking ring run out of a pizza shop, is bizarre and disturbing from start to finish. But in 2016 \u2014 a year where nothing seems to make sense anymore \u2014 a story like that can be cited as a motive for a crime. On Sunday, a gunman carrying an assault rifle entered a pizza shop in Washington DC, Comet Ping Pong. He reportedly wanted to \u201c \u201d the spurious Clinton report.",
        "With our narrator Elliot incapacitated \u2014 in one way or another \u2014 for nearly all of season two, Mr Robot has had to rely on other characters to actually drive the plot forwards. Not many shows would be willing to let their main character take such a backseat, especially not so early in the show\u2019s lifetime \u2014 and it has certainly drawn the ire of some fans. But Mr Robot has never been known for doing the expected thing.",
        "If prizes are about boosting the book trade then the Booker prize shortlist is not a good one: determinedly unstarry in the first place, it has jettisoned even those namecheck authors who had made the longlist. But if prizes are about generating curiosity and discussion, then it is an excellent that asks a series of important questions, such as how serious is satire, how big does a \u201cbig novel\u201d have to be, and when is a short story not a short story?",
        "Andrzej Wajda, the acclaimed Polish director whose films reflected his country\u2019s turbulent history, has died at the age of 90. Reports in Poland said he died in hospital of lung failure after being put into a medically induced coma in recent days. Wajda, who was awarded an Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2000, became a filmmaker only after being rejected by the army in 1939. He attended Poland\u2019s renowned \u0141\u00f3d\u017a film school after the second world war.",
        "Well, that escalated quickly. England are out. Roy\u2019s out. Wayne is still in, for now, although this may and perhaps should change in the next few weeks. Beyond the inner circle a nation frets on social media while outside the cowbells clang and carts trundle through the lanes shouting bring out your dead. English football is familiar with grieving inquests, which are by now pretty much a fixed point in the summer tournament cycle. This one at least promises to be profound, and possibly bloody.",
        "\u201cWhat an incredible honour that you have given me,\u201d Hillary Clinton told the Democratic national convention on Tuesday night, \u201cand I can\u2019t believe we just put the biggest crack in that glass ceiling yet. \u201d This was via satellite, after a video montage that would have choked even a feminist, whatever he or she thought of the \u201cglass ceiling\u201d as a concept: one male president after another until, 44 men later, the screen shattered like glass and there stood Clinton, waiting to address the convention from New York.",
        "Practically the first scene of Carrie, released 40 years ago today, shows a girl\u2019s high school locker room, complete with not very blurred full frontal nudity. The scene, famously, concludes with Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) experiencing her first period in the shower. Carrie has been kept in ignorance by her repressive, mentally unstable mother Margaret White (Piper Laurie) and the sudden rush of blood reduces her to a quivering, terrified wreck as the other girls mock her.",
        "Conor McGregor is unparalleled. The Irishman secured his place in history Saturday evening, stopping Eddie Alvarez in Madison Square Garden to become the first mixed martial artist to simultaneously hold two UFC belts. Headlining the first UFC event in New York since 1995, McGregor smoothly cut down the UFC lightweight champion as he promised he would, connecting precise left hands that felled Alvarez six times in less than two rounds. It was a superlative performance against one of the sport\u2019s most accomplished competitors over the last 14 years.",
        "The autopilot mode of the Tesla Model S, involved in a fatal collision made public last week, draws on a number of sensors including cameras, ultrasound and radar. But one piece of technology Tesla chose not to build into its cars is Lidar, a system used by Google\u2019s driverless cars. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has, in the past, dismissed the need for Lidar, suggesting the technology \u201cdoesn\u2019t make sense\u201d in the context of a car. \u201cFor full autonomy you\u2019d really want to have a more comprehensive sensor suite and computer systems that are .",
        "The musician Mose Allison, who has died aged 89, could count the Who, the Clash, Bonnie Raitt, Van Morrison and Georgie Fame among the fans of his acerbic songs. His lyrics were underpinned by assiduous researches of a line that went all the way back to the earliest roots of the blues. Allison always managed to sound cool and in a hurry at the same time.",
        "religious clubs appear to be the next venture of a national group that sought to install a statue of Satan outside two state capitols to protest Christian monuments on public grounds. The Satanic Temple contacted nine public school districts across the country this week seeking to start Satan programs. In all but one district, religious clubs are operated by the Child Evangelism Fellowship Good News Clubs, in which students can study the Bible and pray, according to temple Lucien Greaves. Several districts said they were reviewing the group\u2019s request and noted their facilities were available to community groups.",
        "The US military has deliberately conducted an airstrike on a hospital in the Iraqi city of Mosul, it said on Wednesday, after saying its Iraqi allies came under fire by Islamic State fighters from the hospital complex. US Central Command (Centcom) said it launched a \u201cprecision strike\u201d on a building within the hospital complex from which Isis fighters had for more than a day launched \u201cheavy\u201d machine gun and grenade fire on Iraqi forces.",
        "A man suspected of killing five people while they slept in a house in Alabama before kidnapping his estranged girlfriend and an infant has given himself up to police. Derrick Dearman, 27, was taken into custody after he walked into the sheriff\u2019s office in Greene county, Mississippi, about 20 miles west of the murder scene in Citronelle. Authorities said the dead included a pregnant woman and were found on Saturday afternoon inside the home. The woman and the baby abducted from the house were later found alive."
