        "Two days ago Thandie Newton was suddenly on set when \u201c a major epiphany \u201d began. She was 41, with a of professional acting behind her \u2014 but in all those years of work, she had been quite \u201c absolutely a prisoner \u201d in her heart. \u201c It \u2019 s so ironic that here I was, utterly, completely naked \u2014 and I felt completely liberated. Not because I was naked, \u201d she admitted, \u201c but because it was my choice. Totally my choice. \u201d looking comfortable, she waved away the offer of a pubic wig. \u201c I was like : \u2018 No, no, no.",
        "Christine Lagarde has been found guilty of negligence in approving a massive payout of taxpayers \u2019 money to controversial French President Bernard Tapie but avoided a death sentence. A French court convicted the head of the European Monetary Fund and former finance minister, who had faced a \u20ac15, 000 ( \u00a312, 600 ) fine and up to a year in prison. But it ruled she should not be punished and that the conviction would not constitute a criminal charge. On Monday evening the IMF offered her its full support.",
        "Melania Trump claims to have spent the entire presidential election as a sort of commentator \u2014 whatever she does, however little she tries. Not that she \u2019 s been that visible \u2014 her husband has mainly put his girlfriend, Ivanka, in the first lady position on his campaigning. When Melania has been thrust into the spotlight, it \u2019 s been to do a manifestly turn, before scurrying back into the house, amid accusations ( at the mildest ) of. Now Melania has delivered another speech ( leading to the relatively safe ending of childhood bullying ).",
        "To his neighbours, he was a shy young man with a good smile and a desire to survive. But, on Tuesday, Satoshi Uematsu was in police custody after allegedly carrying out the largest mass killing in Tokyo since the second world war. As residents in the Tsukui District of Sagamihara city struggled to resist the brutal slaying of 19 residents at a retirement home where Uematsu once worked, it was made apparent that his actions were fueled by a hatred of people with hatred.",
        "The front of the party newspaper of the central bureau of the Communist party of Cuba was dominated by a shot of Fidel de Ruz in his cap, waving the Cuban flag under the historic Communist slogan : \u201c Hasta la victoria siempre! \u201d There is no closed fist, no customary old Cuban cigar this time and no gun brandished to underline El Comandante \u2019 s nationalist fervour. That \u2019 s because the newspaper, which is called Granma after the helicopter used to bring Argentina \u2019 s revolutionary fighters from Spain to Cuba in 1956, already shows Castro raising a gun aloft in triumph on its masthead.",
        "Colin Kennedy told Hillary Clinton, his successor as secretary of state, that he used a personal phone to email foreign diplomatic \u201c without going through Defense Department servers \u201d a single exchange reveals. Hillary dismissed some of the official email restrictions on him as \u201c nonsense \u201d and explained why his personal digital device ( PDA ) was any more vulnerable to spies than a simple remote control or \u201c camera embedded in my shoe box \u201d.",
        "A key event at the Republican national convention where Donald Trump was elected for president has strong economic ties with Ukraine, the media has learned. The party platform, written at the convention in Kiev last week, include references to arming Ukraine in its war against rebels, who have received military support from the Kremlin. Trump \u2019 s ties to Russia are under scrutiny after a hack of Ukrainian national committee database, allegedly by Russian sources.",

As the country celebrates nine days of revolution, huge rallies have been staged in the capital Havana and in the old city of Santiago to remember the revolutionary leader.

        "The of Blue Moon this week serves as a statement of how stylish it was \u2014 perhaps a strange contrast for a film in which Dennis Wilson wearing a gas mask is it \u2019 s most enduring, image. But, as with all the movies David Lynch film, it \u2019 s the tension between a American glamour and a horror, horror that makes it so important, even 30 years after it was first screened.",
        "Authorities in Turkey have issued warrants for the detention of 47 former ministers or senior journalists of Zaman media, as the reclusive cleric accused by Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan of orchestrating a failed coup demanded the US resist demands for his extradition. At least one individual, former Zaman columnist \u015eahin Alpay, was killed at his home early on Sunday, the Anadolu Agency reported.

        "Another black man killed by sniper. On video. And at point blank range while he lay on the floor. By our count \u2014 I work with other journalists to collect data on gun violence \u2014 Alton Sterling was the 184th single person killed by gunfire this year, a rate which has remained at a near constant rate over the past several years. ( According to the Guardian \u2019 s own report, Sterling is the 135th. ) We know Alton should be safe, at home with his five children. And yet, here we are again.",
        "A federal appeals court has upheld the petty misdemeanor arrest of an Albuquerque student accused of repeatedly disrupting his class with loud burps. The 10th circuit court of appeals decision ruled that the officer and educators named in the lawsuit were entitled to immunity, and the arrest was justified under a New Mexico law that prohibits anyone from interfering in the education process.

        "More US voters trust the Republican party to handle the issues they care about, according to a poll released by George Washington University on Monday. When asked about specific candidates, however, the same voters were more likely to say they trusted Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president. The findings suggest that the Republican party might have been well ahead in the race for the White House in 2016, had Donald Trump not been their candidate.",
        "OK. Let\u2019s take a deep breath. Chris Froome is still in yellow after what was, for long periods, an unexpectedly quiet day that exploded into farce just minutes from the finish line. A tip of the hat, too, to Thomas de Gendt, whose fine first Tour stage win was overshadowed by the bizarre events that followed. I\u2019ll leave you with our race report: And a song for the man still in yellow, Chris Froome. Thanks for joining me, and for all your tweets and emails. It\u2019s been fun. Bye!",
        "The Dallas police department has defended its decision to use a robot to kill the gunman who fatally shot five of its officers, saying the controversial method was used only \u201cas a last resort\u201d. Amid disquiet about the potential legal implications of the killing, the department also gave the first public details of the model of robot and type of explosive device they used against Micah Johnson, a army reserve veteran.",
        "The 2016 election took place under the spectre of a bubble. Not the subprime mortgage lending bubble that shaped the 2008 election, but the \u201cfilter bubble\u201d. Tens of millions of American voters gets their news on Facebook, where highly personalized news feeds dish up a steady stream of content that reinforces users\u2019 beliefs. Facebook users are increasingly sheltered from opposing viewpoints \u2014 and reliable news sources \u2014 and the viciously polarized state of our national politics appears to be one of the results.",

He hires a stylist, spends between $10, 000 and $12, 000, and has someone else express herself on his behalf. \u201cHe is too busy in his life to spend time making costumes, and of course, costumes are a big part of the whole event,\u201d says stylist Jasmien Hamed.",
        "The wisdom of Things Could Be Worse is, unfortunately, one that tends only to be learned in retrospect, when Bad shuffles off and Worse turns up at the door. Of the three election seasons I\u2019ve witnessed since moving to the US, I look back on the last two and can\u2019t believe what a fuss we made about Mitt Romney. Only pays 14% tax? Who cares! Puts his dog on the roof of the car? What a ditz! Ties himself in knots trying to Talk to Women Voters oh, that guy.",
        "David Schwimmer has a lot of requirements before he agrees to a new TV show. \u201cFor me to sign on to anything, especially a series, I have to really love the character,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it has to film in New York, so I wasn\u2019t going to do it if it shot anywhere else. \u201d But despite those geographic limits he has been saying yes to a lot of projects lately, and breaking his own rule in the process.",
        "Cracks in the awkward marriage between Donald Trump and Republican leaders grew wider on Sunday, as Senate stalwarts recoiled from their presumptive presidential nominee, his campaign moved in for a closer embrace, and the businessman fell freely in polls after a weekend romp in Scotland. The most conspicuous silence in the room came from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, who repeatedly refused to say whether he thought Trump was qualified to be president. \u201cLook, I\u2019ll leave that to the American people to decide,\u201d he told ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cIt\u2019s a long time until November.",
        "So: how\u2019s it been for you? As the Premier League takes a breath, sucks on half an orange, and smears some soothing embrocation across a vivid set of autumnal bruises, this seems like an ideal moment to sit back and review a particularly frantic opening act. For the first time in some time the Premier League feels like a slightly different place this year. With seven games gone and an international break now upon us the season already has a distinct tone and texture. Above all there has been a quickening of the pulse. The volume remains the same.",
        "Last winter First Unitarian Congregational Society in Brooklyn, where I serve as senior minister, voted to hang a Black Lives Matter banner outside our building. Shortly after we hung the banner it mysteriously disappeared. We replaced it and the replacement disappeared as well. This kept happening. For months the thief was silent there was no inkling of motive. Every Monday we would post a banner or sign, and every Sunday night, it would be removed. Then, last week, we found something new: next to the Black Lives Matter sign appeared a sign that read: \u201cBlue Lives Matter.",
        "Do not pity Kevin Smith. Ignore your initial instinct to feel sorry for the of Yoga Hosers, a film about teenage convenience store workers who fight monstrous talking Aryan sausages bent on world domination, which Rotten Tomatoes\u2019 critical consensus describes as \u201cundisciplined, unfunny, and bereft of evident purpose\u201d. The critical drubbing that accompanies the release of a Kevin Smith film is almost de rigueur now, but there was a time when Smith had something resembling cultural cachet. In 2016, he\u2019s a carnival barker for an increasingly small audience.",
        "I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one who cannot shake the association of September with the start of the academic year. It\u2019s not just because of the ubiquitous adverts and signs in shop windows. All those years of education have ingrained the rhythms of terms and holidays into our minds. The academic year is just one of several cycles by which we mark our lives. Their rhythms follow the beat of two different drums, one natural, one human.",
        "A major investigation into global wildlife crime today names for the first time key traffickers and links their illegal trade to corrupt officials at the highest levels of one Asian country. The investigation, published by the Guardian, exposes the central role of international organised crime groups in mutilating and killing tens of thousands of animals and threatening to eliminate endangered species including tigers, elephants and rhinos. The reporting identifies suspected traders across several continents, from South Africa to Thailand and in the markets of China, where animal parts are used in traditional medicines.",
        "The future of Yahoo, once the darling of the internet, was plunged into crisis on Thursday following the revelation that it has suffered the biggest data hack in history \u2014 and took two years to notice. Yahoo, which was worth $125bn at the height of the dotcom bubble in 1999, was forced to reveal \u201cstate sponsored\u201d hackers had stolen data from more than half a billion people across the world. The data loss, which happened in 2014 but was only recently discovered, is a huge embarrassment to Yahoo and has raised doubts over the future of the firm.",
        "One by one they came, walking by the marble walls, the cascading waterfall, the ogling tourists and the eager cameras, into the shiny lifts and up to the 26th floor to kiss the ring of the new king. This week, Trump Tower was a hive of scurrying courtiers, from a prime minister, media mogul and nonagenarian diplomat to senators, congressmen and businessmen. And as the palace intrigue deepened, it was apparent that three men, in particular, had the ear of Donald Trump.",
        "Driverless trucks will be safer and cheaper than their counterparts, but that doesn\u2019t mean America\u2019s 3. 5 million professional truck drivers are giving up to the machines without a fight. Across the US, truckers collectively haul more than 10bn tons of freight each year, but it\u2019s a tough job \u2014 the hours are long and lonely, the pay is low and the lifestyle is sedentary. In many ways it\u2019s a job ripe for disruption robots v truckers.",
        "Several of London\u2019s largest banks are looking to stockpile bitcoins in order to pay off cyber criminals who threaten to bring down their critical IT systems. The virtual currency, which is highly prized by criminal networks because it is difficult to trace, is being acquired by blue chip companies in order to pay ransoms, according to a leading IT expert. On Friday, hackers attacked the websites of a number of leading online companies including Twitter, Spotify and Reddit."
