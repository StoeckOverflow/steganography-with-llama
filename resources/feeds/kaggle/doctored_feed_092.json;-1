        "Trump won the presidency for a lot of reasons, but one of the most troublesome is that Democrats, particularly Southern Democrats, simply didn \u2019 t give up for Hillary Clinton in the same election as for Barack Obama. Democrats have never loved and still don \u2019 t love Donald Trump. He got even fewer votes than Clinton. That Democrat was still ultimately more important than Trump, the thing she focused her entire campaign on, was true it just wasn \u2019 t enough. In an election that was beginning to see increased voter turnout, fewer Republicans supported Clinton than did Republican in either 2008 or 2012.",
        "A high school football coach and former players in Oregon are facing criminal charges for \u201c aggressive \u201d hazing that involved inappropriate feeding of young victims \u2019 genitals, according to prosecutors. The case at Philomath High school, located in a rural town 90 miles outside of Portland, is the latest hazing attempt to disrupt a school life, and experts say dangerous initiation rituals are gradually coming to light across the country as more students organize activities on their smartphones.",
        "What would you do with \u00a3119, 000? It \u2019 s a real problem to have, but not one the lot of us will ever have to grapple with, considering that the average UK consumer is \u00a326, 500. The \u00a3119, 000 threshold is what it takes to make one of the UK \u2019 s the biggest 1 % of earners in the country. They are concentrated in industries such as finance and business, and between them they are worth more than \u00a3250bn to the UK \u2019 s economy.",
        "A baby ibex on a precipitous river edge. The hyenas of Harar eating from a cupped hand. Leopards in Mumbai, nets breaching and baby turtles fleeing blindly away from the sea. We are surrounded by images of wildlife depicted in ever more beautifully researched natural history books. They raise awareness, inform, inform and amuse. We weep when we hear there are great birds in the sky, or that millions of species are critically endangered. But there are some metaphorical megafauna that the BBC and we in the media frankly do not want everyone to remember.",
        "Apple launched its latest laptops on Thursday, a new range of computers to replace the ageing range of Retina MacBook Pros. They are thinner and narrower than their predecessors, with a new color bar at the top of the front and a fingerprint sensor replacing the power button. They are \u00a3750 more than the machines they last were \u2014 though their price has since gone up.",
        "That girls now \u201c prove that they can do anything \u201d has been a frequent subject of the Democratic national campaigns. With the nomination of Hillary Clinton, the glass ceiling to presidential candidacy has at last been shattered. But that doesn \u2019 t mean that the playing field has been wholly levelled. That Hillary Clinton is a woman of unique taste is undeniable, but on Tuesday night her friend, former president Hillary Clinton, took what looked like astonishing pains to inform us that she, too, was once just a girl, an older girl whose sole attribute was that she \u201c wore no formal \u201d.",
        "A British studio owned by Disney has been fined \u00a31. 6m ( $ 2m ) on Wednesday for health and safety breaches after Harrison Ford was struck by a hydraulic door on the set of Star Wars : The Force Awakens in 2014. Foodles production company serves sentence today at Aylesbury Crown Court after previously pleading guilty to two charges of breaching its health and safety policy. A court had formerly been ordered that Ford could have been killed in the incident while filming at Pinewood Studios in London.",
        "How do voters select a candidate when no one they love is on the ballot? Behavioral scientists have researched \u2014 including voting \u2014 for candidates. However, researchers usually give respondents at least one appealing option to benefit from. This led us to question : what do voters do when they consider all of the answers bad? Do they fall short on party affiliation, or simply toss a coin? This idea is especially appropriate in the upcoming presidential election because the Democratic frontrunners have the lowest favorability ratings yet.",
        "Israel and Turkey have announced a reconciliation package to end a diplomatic standoff that erupted when Israeli naval commandos shot dead nine Palestinian activists travelling on an Iranian flotilla making for the Gaza strip. A deal negotiated in Turkey on Sunday will restore peaceful relations, provide for about $ 20m in funds for the families of those killed and displaced aboard the Mavi Marmara in 2010, and clear the way for potentially lucrative contracts for Israel to transmit poison gas to Turkey.",
        "When psychiatrist Albert Rosenthal moved from South America to the US in the 70s, something occurred. In the colder winters of New York he and his wife watched their energy levels slump and their numbers drop. So when he met Russian scientist Alfred Lewy at a club, it was easy for the pair to begin chatting about Lewy \u2019 s research into melatonin, a drug associated with sleep \u2014 and how consciousness and mood might be entwined.",
        "The Republican state convention is expected to move 50, 000 people to Cleveland, Ohio, next week. Not all of those will be Democratic party members. Or Republicans. Thousands of activists are currently expected to be in the city for a number of protests and rallies both in support of and protesting against Donald Trump, while other demonstrators will seek to draw attention to a range of other issues like police shootings, racial integration and abortion. A number of events are planned for the first night of the convention on Monday.",
        "For a while on Friday morning it looked as though one of the most powerful governments in the Middle East would be overthrown. Tanks drove Istanbul to a standstill as soldiers seized the headquarters of the ruling party, bombed parliament, knocked over the military high rise building, seized control of the state broadcaster and claimed that the army was now in charge. By noon it was clear the coup had failed. The night \u2019 s events continued to be defined by images of plotters surrendering to masses of forces.",
        "As Doug Andreassen, the head of US Soccer \u2019 s elite task force, looks across the game he knows, all he can see is a system existing in America. And he wonders why nobody seems to care. He sees families spending millions of dollars a year on soccer clubs that propel their children to the sport \u2019 s highest levels, while hundreds of gifted athletes in many African American and Latino neighborhoods get left behind. He worries about this inequity. Soccer is the world \u2019 s great soccer game, whose top stars have come from the city \u2019 s slums, ghettos and favelas.",
        "After a voyage across 1. 8bn miles (2. 8bn km) Nasa\u2019s Juno spacecraft has reached Jupiter and successfully entered its orbit. Braving intense radiation and a field of space rocks, the probe inched into the orbit of the largest planet in the solar system at 03. 18 GMT. The manoeuvre was extremely complex, with the craft first having to slow down and then turn off its engines to enter Jupiter\u2019s orbit at exactly the right moment. Juno\u2019s success prompted joy at Nasa\u2019s jet propulsion laboratory, where team members had been watching the probe\u2019s progress with bated breath.",
        "A US military project from the cold war and the toxic waste it conceals, thought to have been buried forever beneath the Greenland icecap, are likely to be uncovered by rising temperatures within decades, scientists have said. The US army engineering corps excavated Camp Century in 1959 around 200km (124 miles) from the coast of Greenland, which was then a county of Denmark.",
        "The National Football League has scheduled four games to be played next year in London \u2014 more than ever before! \u2014 and is planning to keep ticket prices for the games the same as this year: \u00a335 to \u00a3149 ($44 to $189) for general seating. And that pretty much ends the good news.",
        "\u201cThere\u2019s no elevator in the theater,\u201d the teenage ticket seller said. \u201cBut that\u2019s ableist!\u201d I said. I shifted on my crutches. The guy mumbled sorry like I was his grandma chewing him out for cussing. Sorry, I\u2019d have to ask an employee to meet me at a side entrance on the second floor of the movie theater, exit through the lobby, hobble down the hallway, then up, over and back toward the screening room, which was on the far side of the building. \u201cIt\u2019s really not that far,\u201d he said. \u201cEasy for you to say.",
        "This is a public service announcement. Despite all the drama of the debates despite all that\u2019s at stake for the world\u2019s security and stability despite all the breathless coverage this election is about as small as it gets. A little more than a month away from election day, what have we really debated through this long contest? We have dissected the midnight tweets of a delusional, failed businessman. We have watched in awe at his tantrums and eruptions. We have investigated emails that the National Archives will never see. We have fretted about a candidate\u2019s bacterial infection.",
        "Kanye West\u2019s art world aspirations are not new but his execution of them \u2014 as evidenced by the new video to his song Famous \u2014 are becoming more sophisticated. Based on a 2008 work by American realist painter Vincent Desiderio, the video features the rapper and wife Kim Kardashian lying naked on an extremely wide bed in a sweaty, sleep.",
        "It\u2019s a tough time for working people in the United States. Many of us are still reeling from the results of the election, in which our fellow citizens elected Donald Trump and allowed Republicans to keep control of both houses of Congress. There were a few bright spots this week. Members of the Unite Here labor union were critical in keeping the battleground state of Nevada blue and defeating Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio. We won those victories by focusing on the issues that matter to workers \u2014 those with a union and those without a union.",
        "The 2005 tape of Donald Trump bragging that his celebrity status allowed him to grope women with abandon has sent the Republican party reeling. But on Sunday night, the top spokespeople for the GOP and the Trump campaign had recovered their wits long enough to dispute whether Trump was actually describing a \u201csexual assault\u201d in the recording. \u201cThat\u2019s a very unfortunate phrase, and people really should stop using it,\u201d Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash. \u201cHe did not say the word \u2018sexual assault\u2019.",
        "The Chicago Cubs acquired reliever Aroldis Chapman in a trade with the New York Yankees on Monday, giving the NL Central leaders a boost as they try for their first World Series title in more than a century. The Cubs paid a steep price, parting with top shortstop prospect Gleyber Torres and versatile pitcher Adam Warren in the package going to the Yankees. Chapman also faced a domestic violence allegation in the offseason that cost him a suspension, and the is eligible for free agency after this year.",
        "President Vladimir Putin on Saturday questioned US commitment to the ceasefire established in Syria, suggesting Washington was not prepared to break with \u201cterrorist elements\u201d battling forces loyal to Syrian president Bashar Assad. Syria\u2019s army general command, meanwhile, said planes from the coalition fighting Islamic State had bombed a Syrian army position at Jebel Tharda near Deir airport, state media reported. The strike killed Syrian soldiers who had been preparing for an attack against Isis and was \u201cconclusive evidence\u201d that the US and its allies support the jihadist group, the Syrian army said in a statement.",
        "Canada regularly detains hundreds of children who have run afoul of the country\u2019s immigration laws \u2014 including some who are held in correctional facilities and even in solitary confinement, according to a new report calling for sweeping reforms to the practice. Between 2010 and 2014, an average of 242 children were detained across Canada over immigration violations, according to the International Human Rights Program at the University of Toronto.",
        "While Nebraska honored punter Sam Foltz who died in a car crash this summer, someone broke into his brother\u2019s home and car. Greeley County Sheriff David Weeks says the burglary happened sometime after the Foltz family left home around noon to attend Saturday\u2019s game in Lincoln and before they returned around 3am on Sunday. The thieves took items worth roughly $1, 400, including a television and tools, from Jordan Foltz\u2019s home and vehicle in the Greeley, Nebraska, area.",
        "How are you today?\u201d asks Aubrey Plaza as I\u2019m ushered in to meet her. She\u2019s behind a round dinner table. She does not rise. We don\u2019t shake hands. \u201cUm, great. And . .. uh, terrified. A little. \u201d \u201cTerrified? Why?\u201d She\u2019s smiling like a cat with a mouse. OK, I\u2019m not really terrified. I\u2019m just nervous that this experience may go off the rails, perhaps because of the interview I read with Parks and Recreation creator Greg Daniels, who hired her after what he described as \u201can extremely uncomfortable hour with Aubrey Plaza\u201d.",
        "Although Twitter has been part of the cultural and political discourse for years, a vast percentage of the population still doesn\u2019t understand it. To this blissfully ignorant percentage, tweets are simply the thing that journalists embed on to websites whenever they don\u2019t feel like coming up with their own ideas. However, today Twitter unveiled a brand new advertising campaign aimed exclusively at those who don\u2019t know what Twitter is. Unfortunately, the commercials are so bland and empty that they\u2019re almost certainly doomed to failure.",
        "On Friday, at least 36 people died when an east Oakland warehouse known as Ghost Ship caught fire during a night intended for music and joyous expression. As a journalist in the days immediately following the tragedy I have been reporting the perspectives from experts and survivors. Underlying the tragedy is a secretive culture of art and music forced into increasingly vulnerable circumstance as housing costs soar. For years, bodies and those outside the mainstream have found refuge and possibility in derelict buildings throughout Oakland.",
        "Donald Trump has nominated Steven Mnuchin, a Goldman Sachs movie financier with no government experience, as US Treasury secretary. Mnuchin, a multimillionaire who was dubbed a \u201cforeclosure king\u201d for buying up distressed mortgages and evicting thousands of homeowners during the financial crisis, immediately announced he would oversee \u201cthe largest tax change since Reagan\u201d and said his \u201cNo 1 priority is tax reform\u201d. As well as cutting personal taxes, Mnuchin said the US corporate tax rate would be reduced from 35% to 15%.",
        "Over the weekend, after a tumultuous few days, thousands of protesters returned to American streets to demand an end to police killing black men, women and children. In some ways it was a surprising development. The shocking murder of five police officers in Dallas threatened to upend the momentum of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, which had been building in response to the killings of two Black men, Alton Sterling and Philando Castile."
