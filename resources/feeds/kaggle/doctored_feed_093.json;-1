        "Donald Trump has sent some mixed feelings on China. One second they are \u201c raping \u201d America, the next they are his business clients. Even the day he says the word \u2014 and he means it a lot \u2014 seeds confusion. Sometimes the spits it out like honey, sometimes he exclaims the word as if mocking a favoured child. Without his real attitude, those that shape the world \u2019 s economy believe relations are in for a rocky turn when Trump reaches the White House \u2014 and the global situation could be dire.",
        "I woke up on 9 April in a state of shock and shock. As I tried to go about my routine, I found myself suddenly confused when the reality of a Donald Trump presidency started to set in. Thoughts of gay marriage being cancelled, Muslims getting humiliated for their sins, his denial of climate change, his sexist and misogynistic language permeating our society left me sick to my stomach. This was not a horrible dream I could awaken from but a modern era that put much of our basic rights and interests at stake.",
        "Bayern also came from a goal down at home to beat Ingolstadt on Saturday and make it three wins in ten Bundesliga matches as they came two points clear at the top. The champions were somewhat less convincing than in their Europa League win over Rostov on Sunday and were caught napping after eight seconds with the Paraguayan Dario Lezcano slipping the ball through the boot of Manuel Neuer.",
        "It had always looked to be an incendiary tie and, for 90 minutes, it seemed as though it would be perfect for the football, which was fast, fun and exciting. West Ham United finally took the performance that they had wanted to electrify their new stadium and they put themselves on the better side of the result, too. They are into the of the EFL Championship, where they will face Manchester United at Old Trafford.",
        "Tobias Smith is best known for his book This Boy \u2019 s Life, which won the Los Angeles Times annual award for biography. His 1984 novel, The Barracks Thief, won the award for journalism. He was the director of creative arts at Stanford from 2000 to 2002 and received a Carnegie Medal of Arts from the college in 2015. Our candidates for president stand as if they \u2019 re running for king, and not just any one \u2014 no quaint, symbol of national security, no mere figurehead answerable to a constitution and a constitutional assembly. Congress? What \u2019 s that?",
        "Donald Trump \u2019 s elated that the British people have embraced xenophobia and fear over their own economic. He sees the nation \u2019 s exit from the euro ( that \u2019 s the European Union, for those googling it today ) as an affirmation of his own immigration proposals from many of America \u2019 s closest and strongest allies. Many of our old brothers and sisters also viewed the vote as a chance to close their borders. Yet as global markets and the population sank to depressing lows, Trump accepted the rushed Brexit. \u201c Come Wednesday, the American people will have the right to their independence.",
        "The restaurant at the former Trump International Airport in Washington wasn \u2019 t empty on Wednesday night. But it wasn \u2019 t full enough. The handful of diners could stare down on the marbled lobby and bar and see four TVs : two dedicated to American football, four to basketball and a fourth to conservative Fox News \u2014 ran election ads for the closing days of Donald Trump \u2019 s presidential campaign. \u201c The party is jubilant, \u201d said Dominic Vorv, 50, a guy with a cowboy hat who dined on ribeye steak as banal pop music wafted through the Washington post office. \u201c My colleagues are impressed.",
        "Leketha Williams was out of town. When the Oakland, California, neighborhood was evicted and became homeless in January of 2010, she had just enough money to afford a hotel for her and her two daughters, then aged seven and 12. In the ensuing weeks, she worked to bring her children to school on Friday each morning before carrying all of their possessions from one temporary building to the next, often choosing to make dinners for the family out of local microwaves.",
        "I get nauseous every time I hear the name Ralph Nader. If all those votes cast for him for president in 2000 had gone to Al Gore, we might have been watching the Iraq war, the death of George W and Tony Blair, and other horrors. So I hate political parties. I prefer to keep them \u201c fringe \u201d. I don \u2019 t believe that anything has anything to do with the likability of the candidates. Who cares which of them is the one you \u2019 d rather face in the pub? Nor should voting be an act of protest.",
        "This is the year my son fell in love with baseball and for reasons that are still unknown he declared the Miami Marlins his team. He often wears a red Marlins shirt to school with white pants to match the club \u2019 s colors. And each night when we stand in front of the television to watch an hour of baseball before bedtime it is still the Marlins we see.",
        "Within less than 24 hours, social security was gripped with not one, but several incidents of police attacking and killing armed armed men in states where all women have the right to carry arms. It seems that, in places in Louisiana where carrying is ostensibly prohibited, second amendment rules remain out of reach for certain people. On Tuesday evening, Alton Sterling of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, was shot by officers responding to a 911 call stating that a man matching Sterling \u2019 s description had threatened the officer with a gun outside a local store.",
        "When underdogs become overdogs, life changes. They are the masters now, however much they try to believe otherwise. Their power to destroy and ruin lives requires relentless and unforgiving scrutiny. The hangover from the digital age of globalisation has hidden the power of a new elite, let alone the need to hold it to account. The neoliberal order evolved from the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, perhaps earlier with the arrival of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan in. You have to be in your 50s to remember another time.",
        "And that, believe it or not, is that. I \u2019 m the smart one here and it \u2019 s time to turn off the lights. We \u2019 ve not quite enough to catch the sun but we \u2019 ve given it a good chase and it is time to bring our rolling news coverage to an end, or worse, put it under the stairs for the last four years. All that \u2019 s going to say is a big thank you for reading and commenting below the surface.",
        "Shark enthusiasts are concerned about the impact of a viral video that showed a great white shark breaking into a cage occupied by a diver in Mexico. The diver survived, but the harrowing video shed light on a tourism industry that allows people to be within an arm\u2019s length of great white sharks, separated only by the sea and some metal bars.",
        "Have you ever wondered what it would sound like if Drake\u2019s barked barbs or mumbling were woven around the delicate strums of Sufjan Stevens\u2019 glacial tinkering? Really? You have? OK, weird, but good news for you because Tumblr has created Six Swans, a mashup album that does exactly that, so named because of Stevens\u2019 Seven Swans album and Drake\u2019s name for his hometown of Toronto.",
        "In his 2016 new year message the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, promised his 1. 3 billion citizens that the coming 12 months would be a time of \u201copenness and sharing\u201d. \u201cThe future is encouraging and inspiring,\u201d Xi enthused in his upbeat annual address. In fact, 2016 was a year of continued economic slowdown and political tightening as the leaders of China sought to further assert their control over the country with one eye on economic storm clouds ahead.",
        "Born in Oman to Scottish parents, Isla Fisher, 40, was raised in Australia. She started acting as a child and went on to appear in the Australian soap Home And Away. Her films include Wedding Crashers (2005) Confessions Of A Shopaholic (2009) and The Great Gatsby (2013). She lives in Los Angeles with the actor Sacha Baron Cohen, their daughters Olive and Elula, and son Montgomery. Her book for children, Marge In Charge, has just been published. When were you happiest? When I won my first Oscar. Oh, wait \u2014 that was Amy Adams. What is your greatest fear?",
        "Police departments will be required to give the US justice department full details of deadly incidents involving their officers each quarter, under a new government system for counting killings by police that was influenced by the Guardian. Announcing a new program for documenting all \u201c deaths\u201d federal officials said they would actively work to confirm fatal cases seen in media reports and other open sources rather than wait for departments to report them voluntarily.",
        "For the past week I have been thinking, like most people, about the big issue of our time: bras. Among all the surveys and polls and statistics of the last few days, I found one that really delighted me. Nearly 30% of women, despite owning several bras, wear only two of them. Or, as the Sun put it: BRAVO TWO ! WOMEN STICK TO THEIR FAVOURITE PAIR. This is in the general run of their lives, you understand. Not two bras at once. Although, in this changeable climate, never say never.",
        "Propelled by the popularity of Paula Hawkins\u2019 bestselling book, the film adaptation of The Girl on the Train led North American ticket sales over the weekend with $24. 7m, according to studio estimates on Sunday. Less successful was Nate Parker\u2019s Nat Turner biopic The Birth of a Nation, which opened with a disappointing $7. 1m. Receipts were affected by weather conditions in the US, where Hurricane Matthew caused damage and severe flooding throughout the weekend. The Girl on the Train, a psychological thriller starring Emily Blunt, appealed significantly to female moviegoers, who made up 68% of the audience.",
        "It\u2019s tempting to say Clint Irwin, since Toronto shipped five goals in the Conference final even though they scored seven. But if we\u2019re picking one of the trio of designated players to make a difference, let\u2019s assume Giovinco and Bradley do exactly what they\u2019re supposed to do, and Jozy Altidore does that and more, as his been his pattern in these playoffs. If he keeps up his record of scoring in every playoff round, he\u2019ll be their most important player. GP, If you\u2019re not thinking Giovinco, you\u2019re delusional.",
        "Elizabeth Banks will not be returning to the Pitch Perfect director\u2019s chair for the third installment in the hit musical franchise. The actor made her directorial debut with the first sequel, which performed like a blockbuster in the summer of 2015, earning $285m worldwide, including $183m domestically. She had signed on to direct the third installment, but according to Variety, Banks\u2019 packed schedule has forced her to part ways with the project as director.",
        "Atlantic City may be forced by New Jersey into an unprecedented state takeover of its water as the result of a bailout, something experts have warned has worrying echoes of the ongoing water crisis in Flint, Michigan, and could result in price hikes. The of the financially ailing resort town was caused in part by the failures of casinos such as those previously owned by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Casino closures over the past five years opened a cavern in Atlantic City\u2019s budget, as property values plummeted and tax revenues plunged.",
        "Last week, the group Liberty Students Against Trump released a statement rebuking both the Republican presidential nominee and the Liberty University president, Jerry Falwell Jr. In the statement, the group notes: \u201cWe are Liberty students who are disappointed with President Falwell\u2019s endorsement and are tired of being associated with one of the worst presidential candidates in American history. Donald Trump does not represent our values and we want nothing to do with him.",
        "Lupita Nyong\u2019o is, rumour suggests, a nightmare. Difficult. Cold. Prone to making heavy demands. She also quite famously won an Oscar for her first film straight out of Yale School of Drama, just three years ago. So, you might expect a degree of monstrous entitlement, but the buzz spreading through the London film festival seems exaggerated, even by industry standards. Chatshow clips \u2014 Jimmy Kimmel and The Ellen Show, old episodes of Conan O\u2019Brien and Letterman \u2014 offer no evidence of brattiness. \u201cI don\u2019t feel a need to be anyone but myself,\u201d she says of her reputation.",
        "It was one of the world\u2019s largest and most secure paedophile networks \u2014 an online space where tens of thousands traded horror. The website dealt in abuse video and images of children, swapped and boasted about on a forum, accessible only through an encrypted browser. Membership was tightly managed. Quiet accounts raised suspicion and could be suddenly terminated. Those who stayed had to upload new material frequently. More than 45, 000 people complied. But what those thousands never realised, even as heavy users began to disappear, was that the site was being run by police.",
        "Nineteen Wisconsin legislators have called for an official investigation into alleged criminal misconduct by the Republican governor Scott Walker, based on their review of court documents leaked to the Guardian. The legislators, who represent more than half of the Democratic group within the state assembly, have written to the prosecutor for Dane County, which covers the state capital Madison as well as Walker\u2019s home residence.",
        "There was a time, before smartphones and broadband, when you could happily spend the Glastonbury weekend cut off from the outside world. News of what was going on beyond the festival\u2019s boundaries tended to arrive in the form of profoundly unreliable rumours: for some reason, on annual basis in the these included one about the sudden death of Cliff Richard. Now, you can\u2019t get away from current events.",
        "Once again, it is time for the least anticipated part of the awards season: the \u201cBraddies\u201d my personal top 10 film nominations in the categories: film of the year, best director, best actor, best actress, best supporting actor, best supporting actress, best screenwriter and best cinematographer. The nominations are in no particular order. You are, of course, invited to vote in the comment section below and complain about any omissions. Paterson (Dir. Jim Jarmusch) Nocturnal Animals (Dir.

        "Entrepreneur Elon Musk has set himself an ambitious timeline for the colonization of Mars. The South magnate estimates that his private space company, SpaceX, will launch its first manned mission in 2024 \u2014 one decade sooner than Nasa\u2019s ambitions. Musk will grace the 67th International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, on Tuesday, unveiling his plans to send humans to Mars in a keynote talk titled Making Humans a Multiplanetary Species. He will outline what SpaceX deems to be a \u201cgood approach\u201d for establishing a city on the red planet."
