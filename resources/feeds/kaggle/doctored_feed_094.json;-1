        "Frustrated voters have accused politicians in the 2016 presidential elections of neglecting vital issues they felt are crucial to their own prospects and to the survival of the US and the world, Guardian US has found. While political change dominated national \u2019 concerns, economic uncertainty, political corruption and public policy anxieties also weighed highly among the Democrats that respondents told us they found had not been properly discussed so widely in the 2016 election cycle.",
        "The head of the steering body for US Architects has been forced to apologise after a pledge to cooperate with Donald Trump provoked fury in the profession. Donald Trump \u2019 s political boss, Robert Ivy, chief executive of the American Institute of Architects, issued a conciliatory press release suggesting architects were willing to put the controversies of the profession behind them. It noted that the letter had been contentious but added : \u201c The AIA and its 89, 000 members are dedicated to working with Trump to tackle the issues our country faces, particularly strengthening the world \u2019 s ageing infrastructure.",
        "I left my car for the last time in the little resort community of Staten Island, New Hampshire. Instead of saving the land, our charming little lake house had been its killing machine. I still loved her, but I couldn \u2019 t handle the fighting any more, or see a way through it. As the ferry crossed the island to return me to Long Beach, I sensed a huge, dark territory ahead. Sailing through it would require all my skill and patience, and most of my money, although there wasn \u2019 t much of that. I was a struggling television journalist.",
        "First there were the debates about who had the prettiest wife. Then, who had the tiniest hands. And as the great democracy on earth began its big national elections, a chasm grew between what matters and what was actually discussed. Our Voices of America project attempts to prove that right. Climate change became little more than a punchline, foreign policy degenerated to a question of who would, or would not, kick Isis \u2019 s butt the hardest.",
        "How do you ensure that Siri pronounces your name correctly? If you \u2019 re Barbra Streisand you go directly to the source and call the production executive, Tim Roth. In an interview with NPR, the composer, actor and instigator of the Streisand effect, said that after five years of Madonna \u2019 s voice assistant pronouncing her name incorrectly the second \u201c s \u201d is actually not pronounced as a \u201c z \u201d as Siri does she couldn \u2019 t manage it any longer. Streisand told Billboard : \u201c She pronounces my name wrong. [ It \u2019 s ] Streisand with a letter S, like sand on the desert.",
        "Two years after Donald Trump wins the Republican nomination in Cleveland, political operatives are talking about his race as if he has already lost. Trump \u2019 s campaign has careened from controversy to disappointment during a terrible week and has alienated others in his own party by pursuing an alleged feud with the family of a previous Iraq war survivor and his initial outright decision to endorse Paul Ryan, the top ranking elected official in the United States.",
        "A senior economist at Oracle has publicly met after the technology company \u2019 s Safra Catz joined the Trump transition process and expressed support for the. Catz had watched last week \u2019 s meeting of tech leaders at Trump Tower in New Jersey before accepting the position. Prior to the meeting, Catz said : \u201c I hope to tell the that we are with him and will help in any way we can. If he can reform the tax cuts, reduce regulation and make better trade conditions, the US technology company will be stronger and more competitive than India.",
        "Three foreign nationals \u2014 a Russian, an Uzbek and a Kyrgyz \u2014 carried out the shooting and triple bomb bombing at Atat\u00fcrk airport in Istanbul, Turkish officials have said, but questions remain over technical shortcomings that allowed the attackers to penetrate several control centers and kill 43 people. The claims, made to western and international news agencies, failed as Turkish police carrying out raids against suspected Turkish State cells in Istanbul and the Aegean coastal city of Izmir, arresting a further four foreign nationals.",
        "Corpus Christi, Texas, calls itself the \u201c green city by the sea \u201d. But somehow it doesn \u2019 t feel very sparkling. The government imposed a ban on drinking any tap water last Wednesday. No one could drink the water, clean, bathe, do dishes, wash faces, hands, faces or walk with it. There were fears that a corrosive asphalt emulsifier Indulin AA86 had spread all the way from the city \u2019 s financial district into our homes thanks to a \u201c incident \u201d. There was water, almost everywhere, and not a drop to waste.",
        "The Manchester team wobble continues. They should have won this match, and may have done but for an outstanding effort from the Everton goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg, who converted two penalties and shut out two more efforts from Diego Ag\u00fcero and Kevin De Bruyne. Apart from a third successive relegation without a win, Pep Guardiola will be unhappy about his side \u2019 s penalty wastage rate \u2014 of eight awarded this season, they have converted only four \u2014 but otherwise he will be worried that City are losing games without seeing their superiority count.",
        "Red and orange banners decked out the cinema in Beijing \u2019 s Sanlitun Square as eager World of Warcraft board game disciples bustled past for the film premiere. It was after seven on 8 June and fans of the blockbuster films had queued for ages to see the premiere. But the late hour did little to dampen the carnival atmosphere : characters had come armed with extra props, and were in costume, or at least painted with official logos.",
        "French police are seeking a young woman after a car carrying two gas cylinders was parked near cathedral in Paris, police and judicial officials have said. A couple, aged 34 and 29, were also arrested on a road in southern France in connection with the incident and remain in custody, one official told Reuters on Wednesday. The car driver \u2014 who officials said was on an emergency services watchlist of people suspected of religious radicalisation \u2014 was arrested but later released because he had gone to church on Sunday to report that his wife had disappeared with his car.",
        "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story soared to the top of the weekend box office as expected, scoring the December opening ever with $155m in estimated ticket sales. After the biggest Thursday night debut of the year, the intergalactic adventure blasted past industry expectations for a $130m weekend, according Sunday\u2019s studio estimates. Rogue One opened at No 1 in all markets globally, though it has yet to bow in China and Korea. \u201cWe\u2019re in uncharted territory for December,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for the box office tracker comScore.",
        "The odds are that when the stock market opens for trading on Monday morning, its performance will hinge on just how well Donald Trump fared in Sunday night\u2019s town debate. The last time Trump faced off against Hillary Clinton, in a debate late last month, the markets made their views crystal clear. Over the course of the debate, as futures contracts tied to the Standard Poor\u2019s index (agreements to buy or sell the index at a predetermined price) traded overseas, it was possible to watch just what investors thought of a Trump presidency.",
        "If you are one of those people who hoards old electronics, then you might be able to cash in those iPods from the early 2000s for a few hundred dollars \u2014 or even tens of thousands. Like baseball cards from the 60s, Star Wars figurines from the 80s, or Beanie Babies from the 90s, iPods from the early 2000s are becoming the latest collectible items to be trading at frankly ludicrous prices on auction sites like eBay \u2014 especially since Apple announced in September 2014 that it was discontinuing the iPod. A iPod shuffle? $999. 95.",
        "In a blockbuster scoop, Reuters\u2019 Joseph Menn is reporting that Yahoo secretly built a software program in 2015 that scanned all its millions of customers\u2019 incoming emails at the behest of US intelligence officials, which led to its chief security officer resigning in protest. We don\u2019t know exactly what the US government might have been searching for, but we do know that this is potentially a huge privacy violation that strikes at the heart of the fourth amendment\u2019s prohibition on indiscriminate search and seizure.",
        "US international Julian Green became the first American to score a goal for Bayern Munich in a competitive match in Wednesday\u2019s victory over Augsburg in the second round of the German Cup. Green, making his first start for the German champions since December, headed home a cross from Thomas M\u00fcller in the 41st minute to lift the hosts to a lead. It\u2019s been a productive month for Green, who was called up for the US national team\u2019s friendlies against Cuba and New Zealand and scored in both matches.",
        "Like this summer\u2019s Z for Zachariah, Into the Forest (not to be confused with last year\u2019s musical Into the Woods) makes the bold move to present a world on a very small budget. However, unlike Craig Zobel\u2019s assured Patricia Rozema\u2019s drama doesn\u2019t burrow deep into its end of world scenario. In Rozema\u2019s film, the apocalypse begins rather sensually, with talented cinematographer Daniel Grant capturing a female dancer in closeup. The sequence in no way portends what\u2019s about to come.",
        "A lot of prerelease gossip has attended this plonkingly slow and clonkingly laborious wartime thriller starring Brad Pitt as dashing Canadian airman Max Vatan and Marion Cotillard as Marianne Beausejour, the lissom French spy with whom he falls in love. As Pitt\u2019s marriage collapsed in the real world, social media buzzed impertinently about the Allied stars\u2019 relationship. But in this film, there is no chemistry, no romantic fusion, no Bradion, no Mariobrad.",
        "The fans in the Matthew Harding Stand spent the second half bellowing Antonio Conte\u2019s name, making it perfectly clear that they have a new hero at Stamford Bridge, and Chelsea were so dominant they could even afford to give one of their reserve a brief cameo towards the end of this ruthless evisceration of Everton.",
        "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair, Mary Jo White, plans to step down at approximately the same time Barack Obama exits the Oval Office, the agency said on Monday. Her departure will cap a nearly tenure marked by regulatory and enforcement milestones, as well as internal discord over Wall Street rules. It also may leave a sharply understaffed and gridlocked commission in her wake. With White\u2019s departure, the SEC will be left with only two commissioners, who often staunchly disagree with each other \u2014 Democrat Kara Stein and Republican Michael Piwowar.",
        "It was refreshing to hear Courteney Cox boldly admit that she regrets her past efforts to conceal the effects of ageing. The actor\u2019s realisation that it was all fairly pointless might stop the rest of us down here on the ground from trying it. I\u2019m not quite sure what\u2019s she\u2019s tried, she\u2019s been a bit cagey about it, admitting only to the sort of mistake that \u201cdissolves and goes away\u201d but apparently the world has been talking about \u201cher appearance \u2014 bigger lips, forehead, the works\u201d.",
        "US forces in Afghanistan attempted to rescue two hostages last month, the Pentagon said on Thursday, but were unable to locate the two captives, who were professors from the American University of Afghanistan. \u201cPresident Obama authorized US forces to conduct a mission in Afghanistan, aimed at recovering two civilian hostages,\u201d Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, the hostages were not at the location we suspected. During the mission, US forces engaged and killed a number of hostile forces. No US personnel or civilians were harmed.",
        "Scores of disgruntled Bernie Sanders supporters stormed the media center at the Democratic national convention on Tuesday night after Hillary Clinton officially clinched the Democratic presidential nomination, staging a as law enforcement officials and hundreds of members of the press looked on. The protest began a few minutes after Sanders called on the convention to nominate Clinton by acclamation, with dissatisfied supporters of the candidate leaving Wells Fargo Arena in droves.",
        "Democrats lost to Donald Trump because they were unable to capitalize sufficiently on his political weaknesses \u2014 lying, bigotry, bankruptcies, allegations of serial sexual assault \u2014 that would normally be considered disqualifying. If they are to limit the damage Trump wreaks on the country and beat him in four years, they need a new strategy. Fortunately for them, he is already handing them one by behaving as a corrupt kleptocrat. Like Karl Rove\u2019s fiendishly brilliant decision to attack John Kerry\u2019s heroic war service during the 2004 campaign, Democrats should go after their opponent\u2019s strength.",
        "Forces loyal to Bashar have seized control of up to of east Aleppo, meeting little resistance as they stormed northern areas of Syria\u2019s second city leaving tens of thousands of civilians scrambling for ways to escape. The speed of the advance surprised both the Syrian military and its backers as well as those who had vowed to defend districts throughout 12 months of near constant bombardment and siege.",
        "One Monday morning last September, Britain woke to a depraved news story. The prime minister, David Cameron, had committed an \u201cobscene act with a dead pig\u2019s head\u201d according to the Daily Mail. \u201cA distinguished Oxford contemporary claims Cameron once took part in an outrageous initiation ceremony at a Piers Gaveston event, involving a dead pig,\u201d the paper reported.",
        "Emojis, the smartphone icons which have been called \u201cthe world\u2019s fastest growing language\u201d have been diversifying in recent years. But Rayouf Alhumedhi, a student living in Germany, noticed an important figure was still missing from those available \u2014 a woman in a headscarf. The missing emoji became particularly apparent to Alhumedhi, originally of Saudi Arabia, when she was creating a WhatsApp group chat with friends and they each chose an emoji to identify themselves. \u201cMy friends, who don\u2019t wear the headscarf, they found something. \u201d Alhumedhi told the Washington Post. \u201cFor me?",
        "LeBron James won five trophies, including best male athlete and best NBA player, at the ESPY Awards on Wednesday night when frivolity gave way to a call to end gun violence and racial profiling. The show honoring the year\u2019s best athletes and sports moments opened on a somber note, with James and fellow NBA stars Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul and Dwyane Wade standing four abreast on stage addressing the recent shootings of black men by white police officers. \u201cThe urgency to create change is at an high,\u201d Anthony said.",
        "If you had to name the perfect job for Donna Brazile, Democratic National Committee chair might just be it. A consummate insider who is widely respected and liked, she brings more than 30 years of experience as a political strategist and party operative to the table. For a job that requires fundraising, divvying up resources and partisan warriorship, it\u2019s hard to imagine a better r\u00e9sum\u00e9. It isn\u2019t purely a thought experiment, either."
