        "The prospect of an interest rate rise in the world has receded after news that the world \u2019 s top economy suffered a lull in job creation last November. There were 151, 000 jobs added to the world economy in August, below previous \u2019 forecasts for 180, 000 and a marked slowdown after two straight months of growth. Figures from the Department of Labor also suggest wage growth slowed and the unemployment rate remained steady at 4. 9 % defying expectations for it to break down in August.",
        "On the morning of 1 December 2007, in Perugia, Italy, Meredith Kercher collapsed beneath a duvet, in the house she shares with Amanda Knox. She was alive but for a covered in cuts and bruises, her neck cut so severely her head was almost severed from her body. The police interrogation from that morning, revealed for the first time in a Netflix movie, shows the sheer horror of her murder. Blood is smeared in small marks across the walls, running in deep rivulets onto the floor.",
        "Michael Carrick has been given a year extension to his Manchester United contract by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, with the veteran midfielder discussing whether to extend his loan at Old Trafford into a second spell. Carrick, who moved to United in 2006 from Aberdeen for an initial \u00a314m, is out of contract at the beginning of June and had been linked with a transfer away from Old Trafford.",
        "When I was 15 years old, in September 2004, I went to sing mass at my local church in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, with my mother as I usually did. During the sermon a bat started buzzing around the church and members of the congregation began flapping at it. An usher immediately hit it with a prayer stick and it fell to the floor. I could see it was only stunned, so, being an angel lover, I asked my mother if I could take it away.",
        "Built around a rousing tale of heroism, Peter Jackson \u2019 s Deepwater Horizon seemed bound to follow Clint Eastwood \u2019 s Sully as a hit. After all, both come from artists who have proved adept at feeding the appetite for stories of heroism : Berg with Soul Survivor, which made more than $ 125m at the UK box office, and Mann with American Sniper, which grossed approximately three times that amount.",
        "Hillary Clinton made her first speech in the presidential election recount effort on Tuesday, declaring contempt for an attempt to force election authorities to review the election \u2019 s 3m votes by hand. Hillary intervened in the case of a motion brought by Jill Stein, the Green party nominee, which seeks to bar people in Wisconsin from carrying out searches with machines, according to the docket for the suit at Dane County circuit court.",
        "The Indiana attorney and former congressman Mike Pence would seem, in many ways, Donald Trump \u2019 s equal. The evangelical Christian Democrat, beloved by the Koch family, is an unabashed advocate of the policies which Washington deplores. He voted to restrict Medicare from reducing drug prices ( which Trump supports ) and was in favor of both the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ( Reagan has opposed the Iraq War during the campaign, though his view on Afghanistan is less accurate ).",
        "Don \u2019 t build your house on the sandy land, they say, don \u2019 t build it too near the shoreline. Except what if you really want the view? Yes it might slip into the sea during the harsh winter winds, but until then, it \u2019 s nowhere near the shore. Lemonade light twinkling off the water as you sit out in the open with your toast, the gentle plip of leaves against the patio. What \u2019 s a little long for a life like this? This is the point I come to when I read the many urgings to exit my echo chambers.",
        "She was damned if she did and damned if she didn \u2019 t. And in the end Lizzie Armitstead did not win the Olympic road record. She ended up 20 seconds from top, after a competition which went horribly wrong before she even rolled up, to the. The bronze medal went not to Armitstead, who got caught out on some crosswinds with 30km to go and placed fifth, but the Netherlands \u2019 Lisa van der Breggen. The Dutchwoman won in a thrilling jump to the line, with Emma Johansson of Finland repeating the silver she won in France in 2008.",
        "When Laila learnt Islamic State was holding her baby in an old school less than 100 miles from the refugee camps she now calls home, she suddenly start to dream of a rescue attempt. Then, when she heard soldiers were advancing on the group \u2019 s final stronghold in Iraq, she suddenly allowed herself to believe they could liberate her boy. Days later the advance has slowed, there has been no rescue of Yazidi captives by soldiers or rebels, and her despair has returned. \u201c nation is crushed, \u201d she said.",
        "In the village of Shadal Bazar in Mumbai \u2019 s eastern district of Achin, crowds of people had gathered at the home of Haji Raees, a prominent elder, to watch his return from the hajj pilgrimage. At approximately half past three on Wednesday morning, a Pakistani airstrike hit the guesthouse where the male residents were asleep, killing at least 15 people and injuring another 13. That much seems uncontested.",
        "\u201c Music is a cutthroat, disrespectful, motherfucking, lyin \u2019 deceivin \u2019 place of business, and that \u2019 s just the good parts of it! \u201d Darryl \u201c DMC \u201d McDaniels laughs ( possibly channeling Hunter S Thompson \u2019 s phone line about the record label ). We \u2019 re discussing the Devastating Mic Controller \u2019 s autobiography Ten Ways Not to Kill Yourself, which he has also forcefully distributed as an audiobook. It is a raw, revealing narrative which bleeds like a stab wound. \u201c I \u2019 m an addict, \u201d writes DMC, the man who rhymed so enduringly about the rape epidemic on Mary, Missouri.",
        "Donald Trump spent his last major rally before the election focused on two targets : Hillary Clinton and rap music. The Republican nominee trotted out numerous attacks on Clinton, largely unbowed by FBI director Richard Comey \u2019 s decision to clear her in the face of new emails unearthed from her web server on Sunday. \u201c Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency, \u201d he told a cheering crowd in Sarasota. \u201c beat her up, \u201d the crowd chanted in response.",
        "Wall Street reacted positively to the election of Donald Trump as the 45th US president, despite his victory sparking panic on global markets earlier in the day. But experts warned that the US, and global, economy faces a very uncertain future. Here\u2019s how the markets looked at the close. \u2022 The biggest corporate winners were private prison operators, oil companies and pharmaceutical companies. All of these sectors faced punishing regulations under a Clinton presidency, and will benefit from Trump\u2019s mission to loosen controls of businesses.",
        "What is addiction? For the majority who have strong opinions on the matter, addiction is a disease. In fact it\u2019s \u201ca chronic relapsing brain disease\u201d according to the American National Institute on Drug Abuse. This definition, born of the marriage between medicine and neuroscience, is based on the finding that the brain changes with addiction. It\u2019s a definition that\u2019s been absorbed and disseminated by rehab facilities, programmes, policy makers and politicians. It\u2019s the defining credo of the industry. But is it correct? A counter argument is gathering momentum.",
        "A man was mistakenly cremated, after a Los Angeles County coroner\u2019s technician confused his remains with those of another man with the same name, a spokesman for the coroner\u2019s office said. The Los Angeles Times reported that office spokesman Armand Montiel explained on Friday that two men named Jorge Hernandez were at the morgue. One died of an accidental drug overdose earlier this month and the other was indigent and scheduled to be cremated. The mistake occurred when the coroner\u2019s attendant matched the name on the man\u2019s body but failed to check the coroner case number, Montiel said.",
        "Whenever you mention that a piece of art shows violence against women, you can be sure that the comments section will reply, with confused gusto, \u201cWhat about the men? !\u201d Men get shot in movies too, after all why doesn\u2019t anyone complain about that? Hurting men, the argument goes, should negate hurting women. As long as everyone is being treated with equal violence, gender is irrelevant, and we can go back to enjoying murder and mayhem untroubled by conscience, or, indeed, thought. So goes the argument.",
        "At least an hour of physical activity a day may be required to offset the harmful effects of sitting at a desk for eight hours, according to the latest study to highlight the perils of a sedentary lifestyle. The World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline, adopted by Public Health England, recommends 150 minutes of exercise a week but research, based on data from more than one million people, suggests that is insufficient for many. A team of international experts found that the risk of dying during a period of two to 18 years was 9.",
        "On Thursday, just as I am saying goodbye to Margaret Atwood at the end of our interview, I get a text message. \u201cOh,\u201d I say. \u201cBob Dylan\u2019s won the Nobel prize. \u201d She is about to have her photograph taken, and is arranging a rakish grey felt hat atop her steely curls. She looks at me, opens her mouth very slightly, and widens her eyes. They are the faintly unrealistic blue of a Patagonian glacier. \u201cFor what?\u201d she says, aspirating the word \u201cwhat\u201d with devastating effect.",
        "Another victim of college sexual assault has released a statement on the trauma of the attack and ensuing trial, offering a powerful depiction of rape culture and that echoes the viral letter of the woman at the center of the Stanford sexual assault case. Austin James Wilkerson, a former University of Colorado student, was convicted of sexually assaulting a \u201chelpless\u201d and \u201c \u201d student after he told friends he would take care of her. Prosecutors say Wilkerson repeatedly tried to cover up the crime and lied under oath about the full extent of the assault against the vulnerable woman.",
        "On the cover of The Artists\u2019 and Writers\u2019 Cookbook, a pile of chocolate chip cookies, a spaghetti plate, and an oversized eggplant peak out from a bed of leaves that frame a lush, purple background. The richly illustrated cookbook is an updated version of a book released in 1961 that featured contributions from Marcel Duchamp, Man Ray, and Harper Lee, with an introduction written by Alice B Toklas. For the modern edition, the artist and writer Natalie Eve Garrett sourced stories (and actual recipes) from Marina Abramovi\u0107, James Franco and a set of literary celebrities.",
        "The world\u2019s wolf pack may have been wiped out, wildlife officials fear amid an escalating battle between federal and state authorities in Alaska over the aggressive hunting of predators such as wolves and bears. The East Fork wolf pack, found near Denali, North America\u2019s tallest mountain, was first researched in the 1930s and provided the first detailed accounts of wolf behavior and ecology. But years of hunting, trapping and habitat disturbance reduced numbers to just one known female, a male and two pups earlier this year. It\u2019s now believed all may have perished.",
        "The Olympic pool in Rio continues to be a nexus of petty insults, behindbacks and accusations. As the war between Australian swimmer Mack Horton and the entire nation of China continued on Monday, Russia took aim at its old enemy the United States. Michael Phelps won his 19th Olympic gold medal on Sunday, and attracted just as much attention for the purple marks all over his body. They come from cupping therapy, a massage popular with the US Olympic team.",
        "The Earth has an asteroid companion traveling in orbit with it around the sun, Nasa astronomers have discovered. The small asteroid has a slightly tilted orbit, bouncing up and down through Earth\u2019s orbital plane once a year. Over decades, as it scuttles along its path around the solar system, it twists back and forth. The asteroid has been declared a \u201c \u201d too distant to qualify as an actual satellite but cinched by gravity into a relatively close orbit around the sun.",
        "Autumn has come early to Amsterdam but, on the first Sunday in September, a rainy afternoon gives way to watery sunshine as Ruud Gullit arrives with a cheery wave. The calmer currency of his fame these days, even in the Netherlands, means Gullit is in an accommodating mood an hour before our interview is due to begin. In a change from hanging around for a young sporting celebrity, whose talent could never match the brilliance of Gullit in the 1980s, the great old footballer has suggested this earlier start as a way of stretching our time together.",
        "For the past month I haven\u2019t needed to set a morning alarm \u2014 the regime jets do that job for me. Every single day we have been woken at 7am by a missile or by a barrel bomb. I can\u2019t tell if there are mortars, because I am so used to the sound of their explosions that they no longer disturb my sleep. I miss the luxury of waking up slowly, starting the day looking at a picture of my wife and daughter, which I have taped up on the wall.",
        "Take a sweet potato. Slice it thinly. Toast it \u2014 as one might normally do a slice of bread. Toast it again, and possibly once more. Then top with your favourite spread \u2014 might we recommend smashed avocado? Following in the proud trend established by cauliflower \u201crice\u201d and \u201cpizza bases\u201d and lettuce leaf \u201cburger buns\u201d the latest crime to be committed in the name of the movement is \u201csweet potato toast\u201d \u2014 exactly what it sounds like, with slices of sweet potato used in place of bread.",
        "A male Saudi Arabian teenager has been arrested in Riyadh over a series of online videos of conversations between him and a female Californian star that went viral. A Riyadh police spokesperson, Colonel Fawaz said the teenager, known online as Abu Sin, was arrested on Sunday for engaging in \u201cunethical behaviour\u201d in videos with Christina Crockett, a popular broadcaster on the conversational site YouNow. Abu Sin\u2019s real name is not known.",
        "Former US House speaker Dennis Hastert arrived at a Minnesota prison on Wednesday to serve his sentence in a case involving revelations that he sexually abused at least four boys when he coached wrestling at an Illinois high school. The Illinois Republican \u2014 one of the US politicians to ever go to prison \u2014 arrived around noon at the facility in Rochester where he will be known as Inmate No . Hastert, who uses a wheelchair, wore a black shirt and pants as he wheeled himself into the complex between high, fencing.",
        "In an era of increasing dissatisfaction with and disengagement from governments, political parties, and much of the rest of the democratic establishment, it\u2019s more important than ever that you show up and vote. Suffrage is not a right afforded to everyone. Rather, voting is a privilege in the United States \u2014 and a privilege at that. At the beginning of the republic, only those white men with land were allowed a hand in electing our leaders and lawmakers. Later, under President Andrew Jackson, that power was extended to most white men."
