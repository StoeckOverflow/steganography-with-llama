        "Hillary Clinton has the endorsements of nearly two dozen retired generals and admirals, as her candidacy indicates an eagerness to seize the national security agenda from President Trump and the Republican leadership. While the former secretary of state has yet to present a complete rollout of her senior military positions, something recent years have tended to do closer to current day, the Clinton campaign provided the Guardian with a list of 22 retired general and general officers who have already endorsed her. Campaign officials expected more were likely to come in over the next weeks and months.",
        "When Kim premiered a video on Snapchat on Monday, it seemed designed to end Taylor Swift. The video became part of a phone call between Swift and Kardashian \u2019 s husband, Kanye West. Swift has alleged that his song Famous includes misogyny aimed at her in a lyric where West describes her \u201c that bitch \u201d.

        "Last night, thousands of people across the world shared the death of Omran Daqneesh, who was pulled from the rubble of his home in Aleppo. But fewer remember news that his brother had died from injuries sustained in an airstrike, and still fewer know the stories of Ghina and Nagham, my nieces, aged eight and 10, who were murdered by a sniper in Madaya, southern Aleppo, three weeks later, while drinking water from a stream.

        "Twitter has barred US spies from buying bulk data on its servers from a data analytics company. Until now, top national security experts, including the FBI and Google, had been able to parse treasure troves of security data through software from Dataminr, the information analytics company in which Twitter holds a 5 % stake. Agents also enter key locations such as \u201c Isis \u201d or \u201c jihad \u201d and receive alerts for relevant messages, people familiar with the situation said. Apparently not willing to seem too close to American spies, Twitter has halted any future such sales, the agency confirmed on Monday.",
        "On Thursday, Twitter finally admitted what many had suspected for years : its \u201c trending web \u201d feature, a small article that lives on the top right of its website, is edited by people, relying as much on their business sense and good humor guidelines as on Facebook \u2019 s own creative solutions to the problem of finding \u201c trending \u201d stories. The journalists specializing in curating Facebook \u2019 s trending topics feature have reportedly spent much of their two years on the cover forced into silence by government agreements preventing them from even revealing that they worked at the magazine.",

        "Hillary Clinton has made her first official appearance since conceding the election to Donald Trump a week ago, challenging Trump to continue the fight for a president that is \u201c hopeful, inclusive and \u201d. \u201c I will admit coming here tonight wasn \u2019 t the easiest choice for me, \u201d Clinton told the Times in Washington on Wednesday night. \u201c There have been a few times this past week when all I \u2019 ve wanted to do was just to curl up with a new book or our dogs and never leave the house alive again.",
        "Donald Trump faces a presidential duel on Sunday night after a torrid 10 years left him trailing Hillary Clinton in opinion polls in key battleground states. With Democratic voting already under way, the Republican candidate has seen his September polling campaign wiped out and is fast running out of time to shift things back his way in the race for the White House. A presidential debate always offers the prospect of the Trump challenging Clinton to get under his skin and making a gaffe that could send his campaign into disarray.",
        "On a sweaty summer afternoon in Los Angeles, Carlos Ni\u00f1o sat behind the boards in the modest, conditioned studio of Dublab, the internet radio station that\u2019s been broadcasting for 17 years. With a bushy beard taking over his face and a ring on his pinky finger, Ni\u00f1o transmits supernatural jazz and folk rock at a bit rate of 320. His Miguel sat in the corner, with a Mac laptop balancing on his knees and his shoes nowhere to be seen. At around two, they switched on the microphones for a brief spoken interlude.",
        "Yoshitaka Takahashi\u2019s hands are shaking as he scores and cleans the skin of the fish in front of him. The tension rises again when his knife reaches the liver. The slightest mistake in removing the highly toxic organ could end in an agonising death for anyone who eats his fish. Twenty minutes later, the chef has successfully prepared a whole fugu \u2014 or puffer fish \u2014 a Japanese delicacy whose capacity to maim and kill is dividing the country\u2019s culinary world.",
        "Philip Norman\u2019s biography of the Beatles, Shout! has sold more than a million copies. Published in 1981 soon after John Lennon\u2019s murder, it was buoyed by the wave of nostalgia that ensued \u2014 the first stirrings of the Beatles worship that is now an immovable part of popular culture all over the world. Norman delivered arguably the first literary look at Beatledom: the book divided their career into four parts \u2014 Wishing, Getting, Having and Wasting \u2014 and told the story in gleaming prose.

        "Liberal politicians across Europe should remind voters that patriotism is not at odds with pride in the European Union if they want to win at the polls, the Austrian \u2019s campaign manager has said.

        "Just after midnight in the UK on Friday morning, when most of Europe was asleep, foreign exchange dealers in Asia were jolted out of their routine contemplation of the currency markets by a sudden, inexplicable plunge in the value of the pound against the dollar. The UK currency had been under renewed pressure since Sunday, when Theresa May said she would trigger article 50 by next March and hinted at a hard Brexit \u2014 putting immigration controls at the forefront of EU discussions at the expense of remaining in the single market.",
        "As millions nervously refresh polling websites to assess Donald Trump\u2019s chances of catching Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, it can be a shock to see how much of the election map is already coloured red. But while the sight of large Republican swaths easily exaggerates the party\u2019s likely share of voters, it also highlights another, more meaningful, trend. Of the many dividing lines in this bitterly fought election \u2014 race, gender, education \u2014 few are as stark as that between metropolitan America and its less densely populated suburbs, towns and countryside.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign has accused Russia of meddling in the 2016 presidential election, saying its hackers stole Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails and released them to foment disunity in the party and aid Donald Trump.

        "The visible pain of Khizr and Ghazala Khan as they feuded with Donald Trump this week over the memory of their dead son brought up a world of emotions. After my husband, Luis Eduardo Torres, died at the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001, I stood on many smaller platforms as his widow, invoked his name and story to make a public point, and felt excruciating pain each time I did so.",
        "President Barack Obama has staked his legacy on the environment, positioning his administration as the most progressive on climate change in US history. However, an obscure agency within his own administration has quietly spoiled his record by helping fund a steady outpouring of new overseas fossil fuel emissions \u2014 effectively erasing gains expected from his headline clean power plan or fuel efficiency standards. Since January 2009, the US Bank has signed almost $34bn worth of loans and guarantees to companies and foreign governments to build, expand and promote fossil fuel projects abroad.",

        "I suck at meditating. I\u2019m one of those perennially distracted people who knows they need to meditate, has meditated in the past with some success and who knows they should meditate more, but who finds it so much easier to do things like dishes, laundry and exercising than to schedule time to do nothing.

        "With a fortnight still to go before its release, Rogue One is nonetheless set to be 2016\u2019s film. The first \u201canthology\u201d movie in the Star Wars franchise, it is set in roughly the same universe as episodes one to seven, but features none of the familiar characters. Its cast is more credible than : Felicity Jones, Ben Mendelsohn, Riz Ahmed, Diego Luna. Likewise, its British director, Gareth Edwards. Yet such is the strength of George Lucas\u2019s space saga brand, acquired by Disney for $4.",
        "Barack Obama has criticised the way the FBI revealed a new investigation of emails possibly linked to Hillary Clinton\u2019s private server, a move that has rocked the US presidential election in its final stretch.

One even gave Trump a lead, though the Democrat remains the clear favourite.",
        "Top mimic Peter Serafinowicz turns the nominee\u2019s words against him, His Wogan is immaculate, his Caine uncanny. But when it came to capturing the essence of Donald Trump, Peter Serafinowicz \u2014 actor, comedian and gifted mimic \u2014 took a very different approach. Here, suddenly, was Trump attempting to placate Hispanic voters in a plummy British luvvie voice, or firing broadsides at Hillary as a cockney hardman.",
        "The extreme warmth of 2016 has changed so much for the people of the Arctic that even their language is becoming unmoored from the conditions in which they now live. The Yupik, an indigenous people of western Alaska, have dozens of words for the vagaries of sea ice, which is not surprising given the crucial role it plays in subsistence hunting and transportation. But researchers have noted that some of these words, such as \u201ctagneghneq\u201d (thick, dark, weathered ice) are becoming obsolete."
