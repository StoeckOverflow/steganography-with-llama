        "On the day John Prine plays his homecoming show in Pasadena, a sea of baseball fans flood every main artery to celebrate the unthinkable : a World Series win by the Chicago Cubs, their first in 108 seasons. A parade, a rally, and then days of unhinged, but peaceful, revelry fill the night as Prine, who transitioned from a local mailman to becoming one of America \u2019 s most celebrated songwriters, watches below from his hotel window.",
        "If the incoming Bush administration makes mistakes on its campaign promises about mass deportations, California will have a giant whale on its back. The state \u2014 the fifth largest economy in the world \u2014 is home to close to 3 million undocumented immigrants, almost a fifth of the national total. That, in particular, suggests a looming showdown between the Reagan administration and local political leaders, almost all of whom view immigrants as a vital component of Californian life and the state \u2019 s powerhouse politics, and are determined to do whatever they can to help them.",
        "And, breathe out. After 51 wins, 108 goals, 1, 367 shots, 45, 868 seconds and enough combined baguette time to cover, laid of the stone to the moon, Euro 2016 is almost over. It was an oddly fitting spectacle, too. Ten minutes after the final whistle in Paris, with the French crowd already tuned out and Portugal \u2019 s players capering on the stage, there was a wonderfully overblown firework display inside the Stade de France, deliberately designed with a French architect in mind.",
        "On election night in Tubridy \u2019 s bar, one of few bars in the village of Doonbeg, Ireland, that was always open at midnight, pints of beer were being poured with \u201c Trump \u201d dripping on top in creamy froth. A few local women huddled around the walls discussing their man \u2019 s election. \u201c If he wins, we \u2019 ll get that Wall built, sure enough! \u201d one of them cheered. The wall, however, wasn \u2019 t the one you would later think of. Long before he set his sights on Mexico, Donald Trump had his eyes on a particular wall.",
        "My wife had a friend who was a. She was Italian, dark and voluptuous \u2014 and was engaged to a Swede, who was tall, stern and kind. He had cancer and was upfront about it. I asked if I would photograph them together every month, for as long as he lived. He wanted to do it, but she didn \u2019 t : having me around might remind her his days were longer. But I liked the idea and contacted the Aids Action Committee in Washington.",
        "Earlier this week, I found myself in the middle of a feminist debate because of my work on climate change and the ethics of having children. NPR correspondent Mark Ludden profiled some of my work in procreative ethics with an essay entitled, \u201c Should we be having kids in the face of climate change?, \u201d which confirmed my published views that we need to consider adopting a \u201c new family ethic \u201d and even adopting fertility reduction programs in response to the threat from climate change.",
        "A bus transporting journalists at the Rio Games had its windows shattered in an ambush attack on a highway between basketball venues on Tuesday, police said. No one was reported injured in the incident and it was unknown whether the vehicle had been hit by shots or stones. The bus was making its way from the main basketball venue to the Rio Olympic park at Barra da Tijuca when, according to passengers, two shots were heard outside the vehicle. Windows smashed and flying glass found two people with superficial lacerations.",
        "From slave shackles to slaves \u2019 s tambourine : when the Smithsonian \u2019 s African history museum opens next month, it will offer visitors a layered journey through the deep and complicated history of Black people in America culminating in artifacts large and small, old and new. Most of the Smithsonian \u2019 s larger installations \u2014 a cooling tower from the Angola Fort in Louisiana the \u201c mothership \u201d retrieved from frontman George Clinton \u2019 s house \u2014 have been in place since at least this spring.",
        "A man who killed passengers on a crowded commuter train with a knife and holy liquid died of his wounds, as did one of his victims, a woman, Swiss police have stated. Police are still questioning for a motive but said there was no proof the Swiss man from a neighboring region had ties to extremist organizations. The man and the victim returned on Sunday. A woman, a man and a girl remained in hospital with serious injuries, mostly in critical condition, St Gallen canton police spokesman Kruesi said on Sunday.",
        "The Trump Administration responded with criticism of the statement. Mr. Trump and the party denounces hate in any form. This attitude is repulsive and their views do not represent the opinion of millions of Americans who are uniting behind our campaign. A US cybersecurity firm hired by a Russian firm to investigate allegations of a failed line of communication with the Byrd Organization said on Facebook there was no evidence so far of substantive communication, email or financial abuse.",
        "Denver \u2019 s Joe Simmons used a well timed leap over the goal line to block an punt that would have given New Orleans a late punt, Will Parks ran it back 84 yards for a defensive gain, and the Broncos pulled out a comfortable victory over the Saints on defense. The decisive play came while the Superdome crowd was still celebrating Brandin Cooks \u2019 twisting, touchdown run between two defenders. That put New Orleans in line to take the lead with 1 : 28 left.",
        "Well, the madness is over now we \u2019 re in postmortems. Every mainstream blog and every corner of the blogosphere is free of autopsies. Many of these investigations have an anguished \u201c How would this have happened? \u201d tone. Two students in a university garden adjacent to mine have decorated the trees outside with dozens of distraught but determinedly messages. \u201c Love WILL Conquer! \u201d said one. \u201c Knowledge not Ignorance, \u201d yet another. I don \u2019 t propose to return to this genre.",
        "\u201cEgomaniacal. \u201d \u201cPurely Machiavellian. \u201d A man summed up by three words: \u201cfear and bullying\u201d. Former employees do not lack for words to describe Donald Trump\u2019s new campaign chief, a Wall Street veteran who found his flock on the far right, with a site associated with conspiracy theories, provocation and notions unspoken on cable TV. For staffers of Breitbart News, Steve Bannon\u2019s words were law. A former Goldman Sachs banker with an MBA from Harvard, Bannon was appointed this week by Trump to help channel the populist tide that drove him to the top of the Republican ticket.",
        "Donald Trump has settled fraud lawsuits relating to Trump University for $25m, removing a legal headache despite having pledged to fight the cases to the bitter end. Lawyers for the settled the three lawsuits on Friday, averting the prospect of him testifying in a courtroom showdown which threatened to reveal more troubling details about the now defunct real estate course. New York\u2019s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, claimed vindication and victory for those \u201cswindled\u201d by the course.",
        "The French prime minister has drawn criticism for suggesting that naked breasts are more representative of France than a headscarf, in the latest of the bitter political row over the burkini. Manuel Valls, who clashed with France\u2019s education minister over his support for mayors who have banned swimsuits from beaches, gave a rousing speech on Monday night in which he hailed the bare breasts of Marianne, a national symbol of the French Republic. \u201cMarianne has a naked breast because she is feeding the people! She is not veiled, because she is free!",
        "The white man charged with the shooting deaths of nine black parishioners at a South Carolina church asked a judge on Sunday if he could have his defense team back, at least temporarily. In a handwritten request, Dylann Roof asked the US district judge Richard Gergel to bring his defense team back on board for the guilt phase of his federal death penalty trial, which begins this week in Charleston. \u201cI would like to ask if my lawyers can represent me for the guilt phase of the trial only,\u201d Roof wrote.",
        "It was a retort perhaps only one American politician could have produced, and one that silenced the room. Faced with a determined heckler during a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden reached for a very personal response in Cleveland on Thursday. \u201cMy friends died, my American friends,\u201d the heckler was shouting, remonstrating with the over US policy in Syria. \u201cMy friend died,\u201d he repeated, challenging Biden to explain his recent demand that Kurdish allies withdraw from captured Isis territory. The was interrupted again while trying to explain the complex Middle East policy.",
        "Switzerland has rejected imposing quotas on EU workers in a bid to preserve its close economic ties with the bloc, opting instead to try to curb immigration by giving residents priority in new job vacancies. Parliament voted to pass a compromise immigration law, marking a significant climbdown which the country hopes will allow it continued enhanced access to the EU\u2019s single market following a 2014 referendum vote to cap EU immigration.",
        "The cyclist Tejay van Garderen has withdrawn from consideration for the USA team for the Rio Olympics over concerns that the Zika virus outbreak could present risks for his pregnant wife. Health officials have concluded that Zika infections, a virus, in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies.",
        "Hilda Ogden was Weatherfield\u2019s answer to Carmen Miranda. While Miranda wore fruit in her hair, Hilda favoured curlers and headscarf, as if her hairdo were permanently in preparation for a glamorous invitation that never came. And when she warbled in a reedy, affected soprano (usually as she dusted the Rovers Return under the landlady Annie Walker\u2019s patrician eye) those on the receiving end winced.",
        "North Carolina Republicans stripped the incoming Democratic governor of some of his authority on Friday and were on the verge of an even greater power grab, an extraordinary move critics said flies in the face of voters. Just last week, it appeared Republicans were ready to finally accept Democrats\u2019 narrow win in a contentious governor\u2019s race. As it turns out, they weren\u2019t done fighting.",
        "1960: A defining moment for TV and politics. The first and possibly still the most famous American presidential debate pitted the telegenic Democrat John F Kennedy against Republican Richard Nixon. The clammy Nixon was recovering from illness and had a five o\u2019clock shadow but refused makeup. TV viewers are said to have judged Kennedy the winner, whereas radio listeners gave it to Nixon or called it a draw. Kennedy won a narrow election. He was assassinated three years later.",
        "The alleged killer was in custody, his horrific rampage against them apparently over, but San Diego\u2019s homeless residents did not relax as they bedded down for another night on the streets. A mortal peril neutralised? Great. They were relieved. But other potential threats \u2014 the guy with the crowbar, the guy with the razor blade, the guy who screamed and ranted \u2014 remained. So they kept one eye open on Thursday night, as they do every night. \u201cWe live out here. We\u2019re scared shitless.",
        "Greek police have arrested 26 protestors who burst into the Greek Orthodox Cathedral in the northern city of Thessaloniki on Sunday and interrupted mass. The city\u2019s archbishop, who was officiating at another church, said about 30 people had burst into the cathedral of St Gregory Palamas and, aside from interrupting mass, had \u201cdestroyed what they could\u201d. He did not elaborate. The cathedral is named after a archbishop of Thessaloniki, who is revered in the Orthodox church. Police said 19 men and seven women were arrested. Seventeen were Greek and the others were from Germany, England, Austria, Switzerland and Morocco.",
        "\u201cBrush and floss or prepare for loss. \u201d It\u2019s a mantra that has seen many a bathroom bin transformed into a sticky snake pit of discarded threads. But an investigation by the Associated Press now suggests our dentists may have been stringing us along. Freedom of Information requests to the US Department for Health and Human Services (HHS) asking for the evidence underpinning its recommendation for daily flossing have prompted the organisation to quietly drop this advice. Public Health England has also said that it will be reviewing its own guidance on flossing in the New Year.",
        "A footprint measuring over a meter wide that was made by a predator some 80m years ago has been discovered in Bolivia, one of the largest of its kind ever found. The print, which measures nearly 4ft (1. 2 metres) across, probably belonged to the abelisaurus, a biped dinosaur that once roamed South America, said Argentine paleontologist Sebastian Apesteguia, who is studying the find. The print was found some 40 miles (64 km) outside the city of Sucre in central Bolivia by a tourist guide earlier this month.",
        "Many of us in the United States are in deep shock and despair. The election of Donald Trump speaks of a country and a world that represents so many things that go against our deepest grains. However, as I told my children this morning, the Earth will still turn, the sun will still rise. In fact, a Trump presidency will not have the dire consequences that many of us fear \u2014 especially for people like me who will be insulated from his policies. Surely it will change the economics and courts in the US, among other things.",
        "Samsung has recalled its new Galaxy Note 7 smartphones in 10 countries after reports that some batteries exploded or caught fire. Koh head of the South Korean company\u2019s smartphone business, expressed regret over the recall of an estimated 1m devices, which will affect markets including South Korea, the United States and Australia.

        "SSgt Joshua Gravett always knew he wanted to join the US army. He grew up a \u201cmilitary brat\u201d with someone from every generation of his family in the armed forces. He enlisted in 2003, 10 years after \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u2019 (DADT) was signed, the military\u2019s former policy in which lesbian, gay and bisexual members could serve only if they hid their sexuality.
