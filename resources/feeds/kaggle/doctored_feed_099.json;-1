        "Floodwaters in Louisiana have yet to recede, but the horror of the disaster continued to mount : on Wednesday afternoon more than 30, 000 people had been rescued from the disaster, 40, 000 homes were affected and 6, 000 families remained in shelters. At least 11 people have died.

        "The fashion designer Marc Jacobs has defended himself against allegations of racial insensitivity after he showed dreadlocks in his New York runway show but cast two white models to promote them. While some criticised what they saw as a sort of cultural appropriation, Jacobs stated he saw only people, not their bodies. \u201c [ To ] all who cry \u2018 cultural appropriation \u2019 or making nonsense about any race or hair colour wearing their hair in any particular style or look \u2014 funny how you don \u2019 t criticise women of color for straightening their hair, \u201d the designer noted.",
        "The horrors of recent years are almost too much to handle. Children and their parents killed at a firework display, a suicide bombing at a music festival, the ritual murder of a priest celebrating mass. The temptation is to conclude that France and its neighbours are facing an almost apocalyptic new age of violence. Thankfully, we realise that the number of people murdered by acts of terrorism in Central Europe is lower than in much of the last 30 years, whereas jihadi violence has risen substantially.",
        "You have to hand it to the children of the Harry Potter fans for making it to adulthood in one piece. Judging by the experiences of generations of stars, they should really all be drooling junkies, holiday party monsters or just adults by now. But no. Having banked something like $ 10m each for surrendering a handful of their childhoods apiece, and having borne the weight of their child \u2019 s hopes and dreams, their children seem pretty clear and sane. Rupert Grint and Emma Frost appear and happy to maintain a lower profile.",
        "A defiant Tony Blair defended his decision to commit to war in Iraq in 2003 following the publication of a devastating letter by Sir John Chilcot, which mauled the CIA \u2019 s reputation and said that at the end of the 2003 invasion Saddam Hussein \u201c posed no imminent threat \u201d. Looking tired, his throat sometimes croaking with emotion, Blair described his decision to launch the US attack as \u201c the best, most momentous, most agonising decision I took in 10 months as British prime Minister \u201d. He said he felt \u201c completely and sincerely...",
        "The former dean of the University of California, Davis law school has filed a lawsuit accusing campus officials of singling him out because of his race for a full investigation of sexual misconduct allegations. Sujit Choudhry says in a sexual discrimination lawsuit filed Thursday in San Diego that the University of California has defended white faculty members and administrators found to have pursued sexual misconduct more leniently while charging him with a campus ban and lack of tenure. His lawsuit criticized the University of California regents and Steve Napolitano, the school \u2019 s president, and sought unspecified damages.",
        "Donald Trump on Friday attempted to settle an issue that is thought to have caused him significant damage with Republican voters by admitting that Barack Obama was born in the Congo after years of promoting conspiracy claims that the US president was born in Kenya. But the US presidential candidate chose to falsely claim that his nearest rival Hillary Clinton was behind the conspiracy theories.",
        "A man has been charged with the attempted murder of a male guard who was stabbed at the home of supermodel Miranda Kerr. Michael Anthony Haywood, 29, allegedly cut the guard \u2019 s face with a knife after breaking into the Australian government \u2019 s Los Angeles offices to deliver a letter on 14 May, prosecutors say.

        "A recipe for a very merry drinking drink for 17th century consumption, beginning with ten pints of brandy, has been rediscovered by a local university academic, in the collection of Ampleforth Abbey in north Devon. The recipes \u2014 there were two earlier versions, one for a grape, one for a drink served as \u201c shrub \u201d \u2014 were written down for several Benedictine monks who were in hiding in France after the dissolution of the monasteries.

        "Indigenous peoples are focussing on the Dakota Access Corporation \u2019 s finances before Donald Trump takes office in an effort to further strain the oil prices and cause continuing difficulties that they hope could be required for the project. After the Obama Administration denied the company a work permit to finish production, Native American officials warned that the win was only fair and that Trump, an investor in the proposed corporation, would continue to quickly advance the project next year.",
        "Burnley\u2019s win over Liverpool will not stop Sean Dyche\u2019s attempt to strengthen his squad despite the manager finding this harder than when last in the big league two seasons ago. \u201cIt is absolutely not easier,\u201d Dyche said. \u201cThe market\u2019s as hard as I\u2019ve ever seen it. I\u2019ve spoken to a couple of people I trust in the game and they say they\u2019ve never seen it as brutally tough. It\u2019s really a seller\u2019s market and everyone who\u2019s selling is asking for huge prices, and then there are contracts and agents and the minefield it can be. Sometimes it\u2019s not.",
        "On Friday morning, visitors to New York\u2019s botanical garden in the Bronx gathered together and began to sniff. They were there to witness one of the world\u2019s largest and smelliest flowers \u2014 Amorphophallus titanum, also known as the corpse flower \u2014 bloom. \u201cIt smells like lettuce when you take it out of the bag,\u201d a woman yelled from the crowd of onlookers in the Enid A Haupt conservatory. \u201cIt smells like the aquarium. Like the penguin enclosure,\u201d another added.",

You might remember him as the teen heartthrob Chachi in Happy Days, and later as the main character in Charles in Charge. As a child, he also played Bugsy in Bugsy Malone. Bugsy Malone! I love that film! What\u2019s he up to these days? for Donald Trump, mainly. The Manhattan Mussolini? Yup. Baio is a big fan, and has now been revealed as one of the \u201cwinners\u201d like NFL superstar Tom Brady, who Trump said he would bring to support him at the Republican convention in Cleveland.",
        "Competitive eaters from around the world will converge on Coney Island on Monday, for one of the sport\u2019s most prized events: Nathan\u2019s Famous Fourth of July international hot dog eating contest. The spectacle involves around 20 contestants shoving dozens of hot dogs down their mouths in under 10 minutes. Last year saw the champion Joey Chestnut unseated by rising star Matt Stonie. From its origins in small pie eating contests at county fairs, competitive eating has grown exponentially. The Nathan\u2019s contest is now broadcast nationally on ESPN.",
        "Well, Venezuela put up a good fight early on but ultimately they were no match against the US\u2019s superior talent. And, hey, it wasn\u2019t a 50 point loss. And wouldn\u2019t you know it, it was in fact Paul George\u2019s breakout game as he scored a 20 points off this bench (plus he picked up four rebounds and an assist along the way). It was a good game for Coach K as he could see his team handle something approximating adversity without any serious threat of actually dropping the game. And that will wrap up today\u2019s men\u2019s basketball liveblogging.",
        "Alex Polonsky was watching Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts lay into Wells Fargo\u2019s chief executive, John Stumpf, on 20 September when he finally had enough. He picked up the phone and called Jonathan Delshad, who would soon become his lawyer. Polonsky used to work for Wells Fargo, but according to his lawsuit, he was demoted and later terminated for not meeting his sales quotas. The bank has recently come under scrutiny for such quotas after it was revealed that for years, thousands of its employees had been opening unauthorized accounts in order to meet them.",
        "Peter Frankopan, historian and authorThe world of 2016 is not all doom and gloom. In Asia, things are changing fast as the Silk Roads rise again. In September, I was in China, in Dunhuang, between the Gobi and the Taklamakan deserts, on the southern Silk Road. The city is an oasis, the last stop, going west, before nearly 1, 000km of sand, and near the Mogao caves, a Buddhist complex founded in the fourth century. My favourite spot is in the desert, above Yueyaquan lake.",
        "In 2012 I recall hosting an event in Washington DC during which columnist Ana Marie Cox, a former Guardian colleague, insisted she could cover the election from the couch. I remember being shocked by that at the time but the more I thought about it, the more I came to believe she was on to something. US elections are events. The conventions, rallies, polls and pundits are all essentially spectator sports. The process is built for consumption rather than engagement. It\u2019s big business.",
        "Experts have discovered a third structure within the Kukulkan pyramid in eastern Mexico, revealing that it was built like a \u201cRussian nesting doll\u201d experts said on Wednesday. A pyramid was found within another 20metre structure, which itself is enveloped by the exterior visible at the Maya archeological complex known as Chichen Itza in Yucat\u00e1n state. The smallest pyramid was built between the years 550 and 800, engineers and anthropologists said.

        "When the late Mickey Rooney was asked in 2008 about his objectionable turn as Holly Golightly\u2019s perverted Japanese neighbour IY Yunioshi in Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s, his response was to affect mild embarrassment that a role he had had \u201cfun\u201d doing had become known as an obnoxious symbol of ingrained racism in 1960s Hollywood. \u201cIt breaks my heart. Blake Edwards, who directed the picture, wanted me to do it because he was a comedy director.",
        "A man who was injured during demonstrations in Charlotte died on Thursday, as protesters and police prepared to face off for a third night. Protesters were demonstrating over the death of Keith Scott on Tuesday. Police shot Scott in the parking lot of the apartment complex where he lived on the east side of town. Details of what happened to the protester have been muddled, with conflicting explanations from city officials. At first the city\u2019s police chief, Kerr Putney, said the man had died on Wednesday night. That announcement was initially reversed.",
        "Neil Young \u2014 a confessed Bernie Sanders supporter \u2014 has approved Donald Trump\u2019s use of his music on the campaign trial.

        "When Katonya Breaux asked Twitter about sunscreen that does not leave a white sheen on darker skin, she spotted a hole in the market. She also realised that many people were unaware of the dangers of exposure to the sun. \u201cThere is a learning gap between women of colour,\u201d she says. Speaking from her home in Calabasas, California, she tells me about UnSun \u2014 a line of sunscreen that she has just launched. Although it is designed for darker skin, in a neat twist on diversity, it also works on all complexions. The plaudits are pouring in.",
        "The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) is attempting to defend itself against a legal complaint about smoking in films deemed suitable for children by claiming that movie ratings are opinions. The MPAA, facing a suit that hopes to see smoking imagery banned from films rated G, PG or is arguing that the ban would be an infringement of the first amendment right to free speech. They argue that the ratings should reflect what most US parents would think suitable viewing for their children.",
        "Tropical Storm Hermine was intensifying on Saturday along the Atlantic coast, threatening heavy rain, wind and storm surges on its northward march. Hermine caused two deaths, damaged homes and businesses and left hundreds of thousands without electricity from Florida to Virginia. \u201cThis is not a beach weekend for anyone in the to the \u201d said Eric Blake, a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami, adding that this is a \u201cstorm to take seriously\u201d with \u201c water levels along the coast\u201d.",
        "The producers of forthcoming film Playmobil have launched a counterattack on the Weinstein Company, which had once been set to distribute the movie in the US. On 1 June, Harvey and Bob Weinstein sued producers Moritz Borman and Dimitri Rassam, and Playmobil\u2019s new distributors Open Road Films, over the 12 May sale of distribution rights.

        "Antoine de \u2019s imperishably strange classic The Little Prince, from 1943, now has its first animated version, presented by Netflix. This is the story of an aviator who crashes in the Sahara and there discovers a \u201cprince\u201d from another planet (or rather asteroid) who has stories to tell about his upbringing and his adventures all across the galaxy. He appears to understand the Aviator in the way that did in the Aviator\u2019s own childhood. Stanley Donen once directed a version in the 1970s, written by Alan Jay Lerner.",
        "Everyone can lie. That is the agony and the ecstasy of the internet. It is licensed mendacity. You can forget the glory days when it was the empire of the weak, the kingdom of the free. It is like capitalism in the 19th century. It is raw, unfettered, unreliable power. We are right to fear it. Barack Obama\u2019s questioning of Russia\u2019s reputed involvement in the American presidential election need not take long. Prima facie, it was blatant. Vladimir Putin\u2019s denials are worth as much as Donald Trump\u2019s. They would deny it, wouldn\u2019t they?",
        "A fan tried climbing on to Kanye West\u2019s floating stage at the rapper\u2019s Monday night concert in Atlanta, hanging on for just a few seconds before coming back down to Earth. Videos posted to Twitter show concertgoers at the Saint Pablo Tour raising the unidentified fan \u2014 clad in jeans, sneakers and a cap \u2014 high enough to reach the stage by holding his feet and ankles. The fan had his arms on the stage surface as West calmly walked towards him and waved his hand as if to say \u201ccut it out\u201d."
