        "Amazon has been accused of creating \u201c intolerable working day \u201d after allegations that workers have been penalised for ten days and that some are camping near one of its warehouses to make money commuting to work. Simon Rennie, the Liberal Democrat councillor in Scotland, said Amazon should be \u201c ashamed \u201d that workers at its depot in Dunfermline have chosen to camp overnight in the winter. He made the comment after the the Courier newspaper published photos of tents near the factories that it said were being lived in by construction workers.",
        "Labelled an international pariah only decades ago by Boris Putin, and warned he would be murdered in a Syrian quagmire by a patronising Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin ends 2016 if not as the undisputed victor, then at least as the man at the centre of decision making. It is Moscow and not Washington that is calling the battle in the Middle East. Reeling from its devastating war defeat and the final collapse of the Soviet empire, Moscow was unable to free Yugoslavia from what it termed violent aggression.",
        "If Andy Murray had played in a crown of thorns, white shirt and bare foot on broken glass he would hardly have suffered more in pain than he did against Milos Raonic here. The Scot arrived in London this year playing the best tennis of his career, unbeaten for more than seven months, winner of seven consecutive titles and ranked No1 in the world. After an hour of the introduction of the Barclay \u2019 s ATP Challenger Tour Finals, he was misreading the core tenets of tennis as if they were a total insult to him.",
        "The man who murdered three police cars in Baton Rouge was \u201c tactical \u201d in his movements and shots and striking civilians while targeting civilians with \u201c chilling, sheer brutality \u201d authorities said on Monday night. \u201c He was in shape, \u201d Colonel Robert Edmonson of Louisiana state senator said at a press briefing, Edmonson crouching and extending his arms as though holding an assault rifle. \u201c He was intelligent, he was articulate in all manners of engagement. I \u2019 ll just leave it at that.",
        "Throughout the 20th century, my home state of California was known for misfortune : the trail of passing the Dust Bowl the Oklahoma City bombing the Rogers and Hammerstein musical. Despite a penchant for finding country music superstars, Oklahoma remained a tragic wreck en route to greener Wyoming pastures. A bathroom stop on Route 66. Flyover territory.",
        "It was a performance of remarkable intensity and one that deserves to make the most eloquent of statements. Tottenham Hotspur mean business and, after their late miss last year, they are once again shaping up as serious contenders for the Premier League title. Leicester City had arrived in East London with the perfect season record. They departed having been quickly beaten, knocked from their cultured state by the basics that Mauricio Pochettino demands. Tottenham showed the class, too. The most players went white and Dele Alli, Son and Ken Wanyama vied for the award.",
        "A few years ago I found my perfect house, right in the heart of town. The size of a police station, clad in a dark oakwood panelling that had been coated with more than 120 years of spilled alcohol, cigarette smoke and beer, Alt Berlin was as neat as a ashtray. There was only one window, which the residents weren \u2019 t allowed to open because of city ordinance laws, and the text above the urinal that read \u201c smells like pee spirit \u201d had been written by a guy whose nose was as truthful as his punning was fair.",
        "In his 1963 book Mind and Golem, the founder of the cybernetics movement Norbert Wiener presented a compelling thought system. Imagine cutting off one \u2019 s hand, he wrote, but leaving intact the key nerves and nerves. Theoretically, a prosthesis could apply directly both to nerves and organs, giving the subject view of the replacement organ as if it were alive ( I \u2019 m indebted to Thomas Rid for highlighting Wiener \u2019 s second experiment in his new book, Rise of the Machines ). So far so good : this scenario was a reasonable extrapolation at the beginning, and is close to becoming a myth today.",
        "The White House has announced that Barack Obama plans to visit Mexico \u201c early next Tuesday \u201d. The president will leave Seville, Spain on Saturday and return to Washington on Sunday later than planned : The President has accepted an invitation from Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings to travel to Miami early next week. Later in the week, at the White House, the President will complete the work to bring communities together to support our senior officers and communities, and make common ground by sharing policy ideas for reducing the persistent racial disparities in our juvenile justice system.",
        "Is Michael Sheen going to stop acting to pursue a political career since Brexit and the election of Donald Trump? There were a flurry of reports suggesting he may be about to ditch the stage for political activism following a Times magazine interview on Trump, but now, it seems, he might not. The famous actor, who has spoken of his fear at the \u201c global rise of socialism \u201d told the Times on Sunday that his desire to respond to the \u201c demagogic, fascistic \u201d side of politics meant \u201c that I might work less as an actress, and possibly stop \u201d.",
        "The US dollar grew at its fastest level in two years in the fourth quarter, due to a decline in exports and improving business confidence. The news struck a blow to Donald Trump \u2019 s hopes of winning the White House. The US state department on Friday noted that gross domestic product ( GDP ) increased by 2. 9 % in the first quarter, up from 1. 4 % in the second half and higher than economists \u2019 ahead of a 2. 5 % expansion.",
        "MGM \u2019 s second remake of lost the title approximately $ 47. 8m ( \u00a337. 9m ) investors have been seeking. The company released its final earnings statement on 10 December, telling investors that its earnings were $ 20. 2m lower than the equivalent earnings last year, \u201c largely due to $ 47. 8 million of visual impairment charges \u201d. \u201c Our results were also impacted by a significant impairment charge resulting from the substantial underperformance of \u201d MGM CEO Gary Smith was quoted as saying by Deadline.",
        "A thrilling finish to a match fought tooth and nail. Colombia advance to face the winner of Saturday\u2019s match between Mexico and Chile. Listen to the radio call of the shootout on Colombia\u2019s Caracol Radio here \u2014 or check out a full match report below. Peru miss! Cueva sends it over the crossbar and Colombia win on penalties to advance to their first Copa Am\u00e9rica since 2004! Colombia score! Surely Los Cafeteros are in control now. Perez pounds it home! Peru miss! Trauco is denied by David Ospina, whose kick save gives Colombia the edge! Colombia score!",
        "How Hillary Clinton managed to lose an election to a candidate as divisive and unpopular as Donald Trump will baffle observers and agonise Democrats for years to come. Once the shockwave passes, some glimpses of rational explanation may become visible. Incumbent parties rarely hold on to power after eight years in office. George HW Bush, following Reagan, was an exception, but politics has become steadily more polarised since and pendulums have a habit of swinging. Trump\u2019s defiance of expectations has itself also become somewhat of a golden rule in American politics in 2016.",
        "A man has been arrested by police investigating claims that Pippa Middleton\u2019s iCloud account was hacked. Scotland Yard said they arrested the man on Saturday evening at an address in Northamptonshire. Pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge and her children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, are reportedly among 3, 000 images taken from Kate\u2019s sister. Police said that the man had been taken into custody at a south London police station after being arrested on suspicion of a Computer Misuse Act offence. They added later that he had been bailed until late November.",
        "Keenan Reynolds has been given the to play for the Ravens this season after Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus gave him his blessing. Reynolds, who set numerous NCAA records at the US Naval Academy, was picked in the sixth round of the NFL draft by the Baltimore Ravens, but had been waiting for permission from the Navy to join the team. Upon graduation, all athletes from the Navy, Army and Air Force academies are required to complete active duty.",
        "Angelique Caro was pulled from the Pulse nightclub with her right arm shattered. Another round from Omar Mateen\u2019s assault rifle had torn through a lung and settled underneath her collarbone. She was dazed and unable to move, she remembers, when somebody picked her up and carried her to safety. She pleaded with paramedics to stay with her in the ambulance. As a survivor of the attack three weeks ago that killed 49 and wounded 53, Caro knows she is fortunate to have her life despite the devastating wounds she received.",
        "There are countless examples of cult movies that changed in the making, and ended up being better for it. Jeff Bridges reckons 2008\u2019s Iron Man, the movie that launched the Marvel superhero megaverse, began shooting without any script whatsoever. Steven Spielberg\u2019s Jaws was retooled as a Hitchcockian suspense thriller, rather than a monster movie exploitation flick, because the director was forced to admit halfway through filming that the mechanical shark doubling for a real great white looked faker than a $3 bill. But at least these movies had a reasonable sense of identity from the beginning.",
        "The worst mass shooting in American history comes in the midst of a frenzied culture war. In North Carolina, a legislative battle is unfolding over who exactly should be permitted to use which bathroom stall. Many on the Christian right are still reeling over the supreme court\u2019s decision a year ago to compel the states to allow gay marriages, something they see as trampling on their religious liberty. In the aftermath of Orlando, religious conservatives are facing a dilemma. How can they call for a redoubled assault on \u201cradical Islam\u201d without drawing attention to their own homophobic history?",
        "Caffeine may be the \u201cnootropic\u201d brain drug of choice in Silicon Valley, but an hour\u2019s drive north in Solano County, California, the stimulant could get you charged with driving under the influence. That is according to defense attorney Stacey Barrett, speaking on behalf of her client, Joseph Schwab. After being pulled over on 5 August 2015, Schwab was charged by the Solano County district attorney with misdemeanor driving under the influence of a drug. Almost 18 months later, Schwab is preparing to go to trial.",
        "When the first season of Amazon\u2019s The Man in the High Castle arrived last year neither the Democrats nor the Republicans were close to selecting a presidential candidate. Although there was a sense of impending upheaval following two terms of Barack Obama, the show\u2019s alternative history didn\u2019t feel quite as relevant as its second season does now. The series, based on the 1962 novel by Philip K Dick, imagines America in the years following second world war under the premise that the Allies lost. Germany holds control of the eastern half of the US and Japan holds the west.",
        "Airbnb is taking on the tourism industry by offering travellers excursions and experiences hosted by locals, an ambitious expansion which will allow people to plan entire trips through the site. The redesigned app works for a dozen cities, including London, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Paris, Tokyo and Nairobi, and will spread to dozens more next year, and eventually thousands, the company said on Thursday. Offerings include stargazing, surfing, embroidering, food tasting, truffle hunting, burlesque dance lessons, mountain biking, classes and tours.",
        "The clock was showing 94 minutes and 55 seconds when England\u2019s was reminded that trying to bring some sense and order to the national team is going to be anything but straightforward. The paradox is this was probably the finest performance of Gareth Southgate\u2019s brief stint in charge, but even on the nights when England play well there is still the capacity for disappointment and what a way to finish 2016, a year they would probably rather forget.",
        "Trump has completed his dinner outing, according to the press pool: Trump\u2019s motorcade arrived back at Trump Tower at 9:41pm. With that we\u2019ll conclude our politics coverage for the day. See you tomorrow! @realdonaldtrump is going to be president: Republicans declined to criticize Donald Trump\u2019s decision to appoint Steve Bannon as the chief strategist to his impending administration, despite the latter\u2019s record of promoting white supremacy. As lawmakers returned to Washington on Tuesday for the first time since Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election, Democrats swiftly called on the to rescind his hiring of Bannon.",
        "It was one of the most pressing questions on scientists\u2019 minds when Dolly the sheep was put down at the age of six, perhaps halfway through her expected lifespan. Did the cloning process create animals that aged prematurely? There were good reasons to fear so. Since clones are made from adult tissue, it was possible that Dolly was biologically older than her years. She suffered from osteoarthritis, a disease of old age, early in her life. And her telomeres, the genetic caps on chromosomes that shrink with age, were shorter than those in other sheep.",
        "A short walk from the scene of one of the most notorious incidents in 20th century American politics, Hillary Clinton was braced this week for another struggle that could define a political generation. Her speech at Kent State University came nearly 50 years after national guardsmen opened fire on antiwar protesters here, killing four and symbolising a decade of social upheaval. On Monday the campus was as calm as the dozens of college venues that have served as peaceful backdrops for a mostly 2016 election campaign.",
        "Most women think \u2014 swear, even \u2014 that they\u2019d leave a cheating husband. We are, after all, living in the Underwood era, not the Tammy Wynette days: leaving is the celebrated choice for one\u2019s and physical health, and staying in a relationship is seen as all but allowing him do it to you again. The end of a relationship \u2014 even a marriage, even an relationship, even with children in the mix \u2014 is, at this point, the only acceptable consequence of infidelity, and staying is posited as the inexplicable choice for a woman to make.",
        "This year\u2019s Formula One world championship may have been a race almost from the off but a win for Lewis Hamilton in the Mexican Grand Prix has at least ensured the protagonists must weigh in at least once more in earnest. The world champion led his Mercedes Nico Rosberg, from pole and, having already dominated the weekend, proceeded to do so again when it mattered. A win was the minimum the British driver required in his attempt to defend his title and he delivered with almost flawless aplomb at the Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez.",
        "Open trans service in the military is a necessary step toward protecting and recognizing the humanity of trans people, but the military\u2019s proposal falls far short of what is needed. When I first heard about Thursday\u2019s announcement I was grinding and sanding metal to a polish at my prison job. The news was both a relief and reminder of how little we can count on the principles of equality and institutions like the military to bring justice to our community. Even within the military inclusion framework, many issues remain unresolved and concerning.",
        "Dorothy Parker once wrote: \u201cIf you have any young friends who aspire to become writers, the second greatest favour you can do them is to present them with copies of The Elements of Style. The first greatest, of course, is to shoot them now, while they\u2019re happy. \u201d Many Americans, who believe that writing can be taught, will turn to The Elements of Style as the indispensable road map through a trackless desert of whirling words."
