        "Between the return of Matt Damon as super spy Jason Bourne, the popularity of laughing along with a few people in the raunchy comedy Bad Moms and the romantic internet thriller Nerve, there was nothing new for everyone in sight this weekend. Even after a brief hiatus from the series, Jason still draws a broad audience. His Paul episode raked in a healthy $ 60m in its first weekend, according to sales estimates on Sunday. Not allowing for inflation, it was the opening of the season, behind The Bourne Ultimatum \u2019 s $ 69.",
        "One of the biggest factors in the making of a truly great comic horror movie is the quality of the material. It \u2019 s no coincidence that the most favourably reviewed Superman movie of all time, The Dark Knight, also contains the definitive bad movie : Heath Ledger \u2019 s chillingly demented Joker. Also, the most satisfying comic strip heroes are never the squeaky poor, morally unimpeachable. They are troubled individuals with closets overstuffed with skeletons : they are the real Bruce Wayne in Batman Begins Iron Man obsessed with his tainted entitlement Black Widow, so lasciviously in line with her own treachery.",
        "The first man and first woman to resign as Pennsylvania attorney general was sentenced to jail on indictment, completing a catastrophic fall from grace for a rising political star. Former state attorney general Bill Kane, once seen as a potential future governor, was acquitted in August of two felony counts and seven misdemeanors in her perjury trial. She retired from her position two days later, having served May 2013.",
        "An American surfer has suffered a crocodile attack in Costa Rica after his friend fought off the reptile with his bare hands, according to surf workers. The man was in a critical but stable condition after he was bitten by a large crocodile at a popular private beach on Friday. Mike McNulty, who works as a consultant and is a well trained lifeguard in Tamarindo, a northwestern town favored by surfers and said the man was crossing a river with the guy when the crocodile struck.",
        "New Swansea City manager Jim Bradley broke his word on the end of his tenure as president of the US national team, accusing J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann of \u201c jockeying \u201d for his job and calling his firing a \u201c mistake \u201d. \u201c From the time I got fired by the club, I have not said one word publicly about their team, okay? \u201d Bradley said on Twitter during his first press conference since taking over at Washington. \u201c I don \u2019 t appreciate the way it was written, I think they made a mistake.",
        "While we spent a day reporting on Indonesia \u2019 s small, busy capital, a series of talented Instagrammers from the city show us Jakarta through their life \u2014 from kids playing in the streets and the energy of the \u201c unity in diversity \u201d parade to the madness of last hour and the city \u2019 s financial inequalities. Follow @ guardiancities on Instagram and share your photographs of Jakarta with # GuardianJakarta \u2014 or pictures of any capital in the world with # guardiancities. This is @ ijoeel and I \u2019 m taking over @ guardiancities for # GuardianJakarta Jakarta to show you around the Jakarta capital.",
        "Laden with nets and reeking of raw fish, the rusting dhow Ameera has just been moored up in the small port port of 50 miles of Basra. After 10 months of illegal fishing out in the Persian Gulf, the boat \u2019 s stocky nawkhatha ( Arab ) Abu Karar, punches an orange plastic calculator with his rough, stubby teeth, then scribbles numbers on the back of a wooden box. The journey has gone pretty well.",
        "On Christmas Day 1968, the Apollo 8 astronaut Paul Anders took a photograph of the view outside the telescope as his spaceship orbited the moon. The now iconic Earthrise picture shows our blue stars under a decoration of clouds projecting from the blackness of space over the planet surface. The picture encapsulated mankind \u2019 s precariousness in the cosmos and, for many, contained a theme of humility and stewardship for our home. We \u2019 ve had Earthrise and images like it from the Apollo missions for nearly a century now. But suppose some observers had been viewing our planet for its number 4.",
        "After a week of work, the Rolling Stones have announced the release of their 25th studio album, Blue and Lonesome. Described as \u201c five years in the making and just three days to record \u201d the album is a series of blues covers which bring the band back to their roots in the genre. Released on 2 May via Polydor, the Stones \u2019 tenth studio album in over a decade was recorded in London in January 2015, and features \u201c old man \u201d Eric Clapton, who happened to be in the next studio releasing his own album at the time.",
        "When he was a child, Carlos \u2019 s parents nicknamed him \u201c the Black \u201d. Theirs was not a peaceful home : air force intelligence arrested Francisco G\u00f3mez visiting his wife Teodora Jofre frequently. \u201c I hear him threaten her with a knife, hit her with a rifle butt, dump her on the floor and shout he might put a bullet in her, \u201d Guillermo eventually told a newspaper in Buenos Aires, months later. On school terms, G\u00f3mez would encourage Guillermo to spend the day at the Buenos Aires Defense Intelligence ( Riba ) air force base.",
        "An Argentinian rugby player has been banned for three matches after tackling a female referee during an Argentine league match. Referee Andres Doglioli violently barged over Maria Maria Benvenuti from behind during a game between Vicenza and Valsugana. Benvenuti awarded Doglioli a yellow card for the offence. The referee was able to continue the match but was later sent to the hospital, where she was diagnosed with whiplash. The Italian Rugby Federation has granted Doglioli a ban, its heaviest punishment in the past 20 years. It is unlikely the will appear again professionally. Vicenza had already suspended the player.",
        "Nearly five weeks after House Republicans staged a historic to demand action on gun safety legislation, the Republican caucus of the House has agreed to pass a vote on a single item : a measure to allow the inspector general to delay the supply of a gun to a suspected criminal for three days, similar to a Senate measure sponsored by the National Rifle Association.",
        "Every major film festival is essentially an island \u2014 or at least its own microclimate \u2014 and the fact that the Lido literally is an island can sometimes make the Venice film festival seem entirely cut off from the outside world. This year, however, Venice felt like an integral part of the flow of the bigger universe. One reason was because its festivities were cancelled in solidarity with those affected by the recent Italian earthquake. Another reason is because you felt that more of its selections were likely to matter to the outside world than in some recent editions.",
        "Lochte wins gold in the men\u2019s 4x200 freestyle relay alongside Michael Phelps, Townley Hass and Connor Dwyer. Lochte becomes second most decorated male Olympic swimmer of all time, trailing only to Phelps. Two days later he finishes fifth in the 200m individual medley, his final race at the Games. Shortly after 9am, initial reports of Lochte being held at gunpoint begin to surface, with his mother, Ileana Lochte telling USA Today he had called her immediately after the incident. \u201cI think they\u2019re all shaken up. There were a few of them,\u201d she tells the paper.",
        "The federal government will permit a US startup to send a robotic spacecraft to the moon next year, paving the way for the company to be the first organization to land on the moon. Moon Express announced on Wednesday morning that it had been granted approval for its planned 2017 lunar mission. Previously, commercial companies have traveled only within Earth\u2019s orbit.",
        "A friend of Amber Heard has come out in defense of the actor and fights back in an essay against claims that Heard fabricated her domestic abuse allegations against her estranged husband, Johnny Depp, to squeeze money out of the star. iO Tillett Wright, a photographer, actor and MTV host, explains in the essay, published by Refinery29, why she called 911 to report the alleged abuse that caused Heard to file for divorce from her husband of one year. \u201cI called 911 because she never would,\u201d Wright wrote.",
        "Suppressing bad memories from the past can block memory formation in the here and now, research suggests. The study could help to explain why those suffering from stress disorder (PTSD) and other psychological conditions often experience difficulty in remembering recent events, scientists say. Writing in Nature Communications, the authors describe how trying to forget past incidents by suppressing our recollections can create a \u201cvirtual lesion\u201d in the brain that casts an \u201camnesiac shadow\u201d over the formation of new memories.",
        "A disabled teenage cancer patient was injured during a violent arrest by security agents at Memphis international airport, her family has alleged in a lawsuit filed against the Transport Security Administration. Hannah Cohen, 18, at the time of her arrest on 30 June 2015, and her mother had been on their way home to Chattanooga from St Jude\u2019s hospital in Memphis, where Hannah underwent her final treatment for a brain tumor. Hannah and her mother, Shirley, told the Guardian that the pair had made the trip hundreds of times, and knew the airport security routine well.",
        "Name: Toblerone. Age: 108. Appearance: Basically just a row of gravestones. I read something about this. It\u2019s an outrage, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m taking it as a personal insult. Tell me what happened. It\u2019s disgusting. You should see it. You know how a Toblerone is a row of small chocolate pyramids next to each other? Yes. Well, now they\u2019ve changed it. Now \u2014 get this! \u2014 it\u2019s a row of slightly smaller pyramids, with gaps in between. I\u2019m not sure I understand the problem. It looks nothing like a Toblerone any more!",
        "Rarely have the strengths and frailties of modern athletes been so cruelly exposed as in the major tennis stadiums of the world over the past decade or so. In Paris this week, we will witness the tensile limits of two of the game\u2019s most enduring men of steel, as Andy Murray seeks to unseat Novak Djokovic as the best player in the world.",
        "Audre Lorde once wrote that \u201cpoetry is not a luxury\u201d and right now it is a necessity. What kind of poetry can get us through a Donald Trump presidency? We\u2019ll need satire and spitting vitriol. We\u2019ll need rallying cries. We\u2019ll need reminders of human dignity. Each poet here has struggled with the relationship between poetry and action, with the question of poetry\u2019s relevance in a time of crisis. Adrienne Rich said: \u201cA poem can\u2019t free us from the struggle for existence, but it can uncover desires and appetites buried under the accumulating emergencies of life.",
        "If there\u2019s anything we have learned this year, it\u2019s that somehow, some way, the race for the presidency and the Cleveland Browns can always get worse. Each time we think things can\u2019t possibly go lower, that surely Donald Trump couldn\u2019t do anything grosser than criticizing PoWs, that even the Browns couldn\u2019t suffer misfortune beyond losing their new starting quarterback to injury during the season opener, we are quickly reminded that this is no regular campaign and that the Browns are no regular losing football team.",
        "The frequency of floods of the magnitude of Hurricane Sandy, which devastated parts of New York City in 2012, is rising so sharply that they could become relatively normal, with a raft of new research laying bare the enormous upheavals already under way in the US due to climate change. These findings and two other fresh pieces of research have highlighted how the US is already in the grip of significant environmental changes driven by warming temperatures, albeit in different ways to the processes that are fueling hurricanes.",
        "All of Donald Trump\u2019s strengths and weaknesses were on display this week as he kicked off the homestretch of his presidential campaign. From a walk through a county fair in Ohio, where throngs of people standing four and five deep along a paved path reached out to touch the waving Trump to a televised interview where the Republican nominee praised Vladimir Putin and denigrated American generals, it was a microcosm of Trump\u2019s campaign.",
        "It is, arguably, the biggest mystery in modern literature: the true identity of novelist Elena Ferrante. But when one of Italy\u2019s investigative journalists claimed to have unmasked her on Sunday, the response of many in the literary world was to ask why he had felt the need to do so.",
        "Here is a film with its heart in the right place, an anatomical correctness coexisting with heartfelt, forthright conviction and an admirable belief in the virtue of simplicity and underplaying. Nobody mentions the wonderful serendipity of the characters\u2019 surnames. But this restraint sometimes sags into a kind of absence, and means the film itself is a bit rhetorically underpowered. Jeff Nichols is here to dramatise and give due mythological prominence to a remarkable legal case which helped change America\u2019s ugly Jim Crow race laws in the 50s and 60s.",
        "On a sunny November day nearly four years ago, as I flipped through a Pottery Barn catalog on our deck, my husband of 14 years revealed that he had been having an affair for the previous 10 months. His revelation was a punch in my gut, and as my mind simultaneously raced for comprehension and was struck numb, he dropped his next bombshell: his mistress was six months pregnant. In that moment, I was faced with my worst fear.",
        "The United Nations security council has strongly condemned North Korea\u2019s latest launch of three ballistic missiles, and threatened \u201cfurther significant measures\u201d if the Pyongyang regime continued its missile and nuclear weapons development work. Diplomats at the UN said that this latest rebuke of North Korea was agreed unusually quickly, reflecting China\u2019s anger at the missile launch on Monday as President Xi Jinping was hosting the G20 summit in Hangzhou. Despite the bluntly worded statement, describing North Korea\u2019s \u201cflagrant disregard\u201d of its demands, there are no immediate plans to begin discussions on new sanctions.",
        "A Los Angeles judge has granted a restraining order against Johnny Depp from his estranged wife Amber Heard, who has accused him of domestic violence, court documents show. The documents, filed on Friday by lawyers representing Heard, state that Depp \u201cviolently attacked\u201d Heard on Saturday night in their penthouse apartment. Photographs submitted to the court show Heard with a large bruise on her face, as well as broken bottles, picture frames and shattered glass on the floor.",
        "More than 200, 000 people are expected to participate in a mass demonstration the day after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, the Women\u2019s March on Washington. Since the idea first emerged with a vision to take over the Lincoln Memorial in the days after the election results, plans have shifted, developed and expanded worldwide. Here\u2019s what you need to know about protest plans on 21 January. Many locations on the National Mall in Washington are to protesters, including the Lincoln Memorial. This is in large part because inauguration equipment including bleachers won\u2019t have been cleared from these areas yet."
