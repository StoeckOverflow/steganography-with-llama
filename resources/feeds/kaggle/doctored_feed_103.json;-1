        "Tannishtha Chatterjee laughed shortly with the first jokes, but they continued. The Indian actor had intended to attend a comedy roast to celebrate her latest film, Parched. But again and again, as the week went on, the hosts \u2019 jibes started to centre on one joke. \u201c You must like black plums. How many have you eaten since childhood? \u201d one man quipped. \u201c To my utmost horror, \u201d Chatterjee later wrote, \u201c I soon realised that the only quality they found worth roasting about in me was my serious tone. \u201d About halfway through she went off the programme.",
        "Twelve days ago the Golden State Warriors were down two straight in the conference finals. Their prospects of winning the series looked bleak, but the overwhelming consensus was that if any team could come back from a deficit, it would be the historic Warriors, the conference \u2019 s defending champs. On Monday, the Cavaliers find themselves in a similar position playing in the NBA finals and not losing their best basketball. Only it seems hard to find a winning soul alive who believed they can beat the Warriors.",
        "Gene Wilder exemplified a certain kind of crazed comedy intensity that found a broad audience in the 1970s and 80s, with Wilder shown to function best in company with other comedy greats : principally Mel Brooks, with whom he made numerous masterpieces, and Richard Pryor. Wilder had a supporting role in a TV movie of Death of Salesman, and another bit part in Bonnie and Clyde, but the film that really put him on the map was Mel Gibson \u2019 celebrated The Producers, made in 1967.",
        "The University of Kentucky has rocked by more allegations of NCAA fraud in its athletics programs, just months after the men \u2019 s golf program accepted a lawsuit for breaking NCAA records. Yolanda Kumar, a former principal at Mizzou, claimed on Tuesday that she had missed exams and completed classes for unnamed at the school. She said in a Facebook post that she \u201c knowingly engaging in academic dishonesty \u201d and said : \u201c I can \u2019 t take this burden any more. \u201d Kumar stated she was encouraged to commit wrongdoing by members of staff.",
        "He has won world renown \u2014 and an international \u2014 for his roles in films by some of the best male directors. Now called Ben Kingsley, author of Gandhi and Sexy Beast, says he is determined to produce and act in movies directed by female \u2014 because they are better at understanding male vulnerability. The veteran director is calling for the entertainment industry to give women a larger role behind the camera, and is planning various movies with female directors and actors.",
        "The Greek Prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has reshuffled his position to boost bailout reforms in the hopes of getting the EU to agree to critical debt ceiling by the end of the year. Heralding a new political era for his administration, the embattled leader said on Friday the time had come to expedite reforms demanded by international parties and \u201c turn the page \u201d. Hardline speakers who had criticised policies like privatisations were dumped for moderate technocrats in what was perceived as a further shift to the centre by the Republicans who once personified the hope of Europe \u2019 s radical left.",
        "With only 20 % of millennials identifying with the GOP, being a conservative Republican has never been seen so unfashionable. But following fashion has always really trended with those leaning toward. Pearls, blazers and hair for the young ladies sweater vests, chinos and helmet hats for the gentlemen. You could call it GOPcore : a uniform of uniformity. But are these just stereotypes, or do certain people really behave differently based on their religious affiliation? We asked YouGov, a consumer research company, to look into whether the statistics fit the stereotypes. And we found that they do.",
        "One evening in the summer of 2014, I found myself in the province of Tacloban in the Philippines. The city and surrounding area had been devastated less than a year earlier by super Typhoon Yolanda. Thousands had been whose bodies were found for burial afterwards. As part of an international research collaboration, I was interviewing elected officials and others across the Philippines to assess how to achieve preparedness for and response to disasters. I had also interviewed survivors in cities and villages across the country about the impacts of extreme storms.",
        "Donald Trump \u2019 s favourite movie is Citizen Kane, as he explains in oddly mesmeric archive footage taken earlier this year by the movie maker Errol Morris. \u201c Tom Kane is really about time, \u201d he analyses. Asked to offer a fix for the protagonist \u2019 s problems, Donald advises : \u201c Get yourself a different movie. \u201d Like the rest of America, Charles Foster Kane \u2014 and indeed William Randolph Hearst, on whom Orson Welles \u2019 s masterpiece was transparently based \u2014 should have listened to the Donald. The narrator knows the value of the information we accumulate, or certainly the price of them.",
        "Lady Leshurr has just arrived back from the US. She has been spending a lot of time there this week, she says : \u201c We \u2019 ve been to Atlanta, Nashville, New Orleans, Buffalo, New York. \u201d She gets a gig in the latter, the band \u2019 s enthusiasm apparently undimmed by the fact that she raps with a distinct Brummie twang : \u201c I didn \u2019 t think they \u2019 d be able to understand me, didn \u2019 t think my English, of all accents, would have crossed over like that. But they were singing my lyrics directly at me.",
        "Sipping a craft coffee outdoors on a warm afternoon, Janna Greer reaches for her phone and plays a video shot a few days back. The scene is full of giddy euphoria as the people of Cleveland, Cleveland, celebrate winning the state basketball championship \u2014 and end their wait for a major league trophy. \u201c I get chills talking about it, \u201d said Greer, 37, with a sentiment recognisable to many from Leicester to Kansas City who have tasted sporting glory after a long drought. \u201c We grew up as kids thinking we \u2019 d actually see it.",
        "A Harvard Business School study has concluded that racial bias, historically aggressive prosecutions and inadequate facilities for poor defendants cause death penalty problems in Harris County, Texas. Juries in the county, which includes Dallas, have imposed the death penalty more than any other county in the US since its reinstatement in 1976. The Fair Punishment Project website notes that the number of death sentences handed down in Harris County has fallen to 10 since 2010, from 53 between 1998 and 2003.",
        "The chief of Britain \u2019 s Secret Intelligence Service, Alex Younger, said on Thursday that the organisation \u2019 s most famous fictional agent, James Bond, is both a blessing and curse. The upside of the Bond books and movies is that MI6, as SIS is more commonly referred to, is one of the intelligence agencies in the world, and guarantees that almost anyone Younger invites to lunch will attend. The downside to such \u201c false stereotypes \u201d he said, was that Bond created a view of an MI6 agent that bore no resemblance to Bond.",
        "In the safe, sanitised world of the multiplex, where product placement and brand partnerships reign supreme, it\u2019s rare to see a mainstream film with the guts to double as a takedown of a dollar company. But, after watching Peter Berg\u2019s surprisingly yet deservedly angry restaging of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, which caused 11 deaths and the biggest oil spill in history, it\u2019ll take a minor PR miracle to restore the average moviegoer\u2019s faith in BP. On paper, Berg is a poor choice for the material.",
        "Philip Larkin famously announced that sexual intercourse began in 1963 (\u201cBetween the end of the \u2018Chatterley\u2019 ban And the Beatles\u2019 first LP\u201d). Being French, and a psychiatrist to boot, Philippe Brenot takes a rather longer view. In his latest book, The Story of Sex, a bestseller in France, he runs an anthropological eye over the sexual mores of human societies from prehistoric times to today. Yet Brenot believes that the sexual revolution did spark a dramatic change, creating the modern couple, which is the basis of our families today.",
        "There is no doubt the opera stage has seen its fair share of blood through the years, whether it be the mad scene in Donizetti\u2019s Lucia di Lammermoor, the ethereal yet obstinate stain soiling Lady Macbeth\u2019s hand, the crimson droplets that portend the end of Mimi in La boheme, or even the corpses of suitors scattered outside the palace of Turandot.",
        "The Donald Trump campaign is counting on \u201cundercover voters\u201d to win in November. Trump\u2019s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway outlined her vision of how the Republican nominee could win in November despite consistently trailing in polls, during an interview with Channel 4 in the United Kingdom for the documentary President Trump: Can He Really Win? Conway insisted that Trump\u2019s support was not reflected in polls because of the perceived social stigma of supporting the Republican nominee.",
        "The first time that someone urged me to read Elena Ferrante, he mentioned her anonymity, along with her evocation of Naples, and her peerless representation of women\u2019s friendships, as among her most impressive qualities. This was in 2013, shortly after the critic James Wood had introduced Ferrante to readers of the New Yorker, in an essay that dwelt on her anonymity. \u201cCompared with Ferrante,\u201d Wood wrote, \u201cThomas Pynchon is a publicity profligate. \u201d A few things were known about the writer, thanks to Ferrante\u2019s generosity with written interviews, which routinely feature her anonymity. She grew up in Naples.",
        "A 500 square foot area in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami, Florida is now the epicenter of the US fight against Zika, as federal and state health officials said at least 15 people were infected with the virus by local mosquitoes. Officials said more diagnoses could be made in the coming days. The cases represent the first Zika infections transmitted by mainland American mosquitoes. The city began aerial spraying against the mosquitoes, a technique whose effectiveness is hotly criticized.",
        "The New York Giants have released placekicker Josh Brown after police documents revealed Brown had admitted to repeatedly abusing his former wife while they were married. The Giants president, John Mara, says the team was \u201cmisguided\u201d in how it handled its relationship with Brown. He says the team hopes Brown will dedicate himself to rehabilitation and becoming a better person and father. \u201cWe believed we did the right thing at every juncture in our relationship with Josh,\u201d said Mara. \u201cOur beliefs, our judgments and our decisions were misguided. We accept that responsibility.",
        "The year 2017 promises an embarrassment of riches in the arts and culture scene that will make 2016 look like the year William Howard Taft broke the bathtub in the White House because he was too fat. Yes, 2017 is littered with retread movies, musical comebacks, sitcoms, and a film based on the little yellow faces we use to communicate instead of words \u2014 but such is the nature of the modern world we live in. We are spoiled for choice in this multimedia culture.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s claims of \u201c \u201d voter fraud have prompted officials across the political spectrum to warn about the dangers of vigilante poll monitors amid fears of confrontations or even violence on US election day. As opinion polls tightened this week between Trump and Hillary Clinton ahead of Tuesday\u2019s presidential vote, there are concerns of chaos following his claims, without serious evidence, that the election could be \u201crigged\u201d and his refusal to say if he will accept the outcome.",
        "When a Sean Connery resurrected the role of James Bond in 1983 after a break, even the title of the movie in which the debonaire Scotsman strapped on his Walther PPK and took on the forces of Spectre one last time seemed to hint at the project\u2019s questionable nature. Never Say Never Again turned out to be a decent enough revival for Connery certainly preferable to Octopussy, the official Bond film that emerged the same year with an even older Roger Moore as 007.",
        "While Japanese families enjoy the Christmas Eve ritual of tucking into fried chicken and sponge cake, millions of or simply lustful, couples will discreetly observe another festive tradition with a visit to a love hotel. They will enter a dimly lit lobby and, after a brief discussion, select a room with the push of a button. Then, for just a few thousand yen ($ ) \u2014 handed to an unseen receptionist \u2014 they will be free to make the most of their fleeting moment of privacy.",
        "How do you tell a gold medal winning cyclist she needs to stop getting bikini waxes? \u201cIt was a tricky one to broach,\u201d admits Phil Burt, British Cycling\u2019s physiotherapist. \u201cBut we knew that we had to try to persuade the girls to stop shaving and waxing if we were going to sort out the saddle pain we knew all of them were suffering with. At one point we were saying: \u2018Should we be buying the girls ?",
        "The late Dr John Ugelstad was a hero of Norwegian science. \u201cWhy go to space when you can go to Trondheim,\u201d Newsweek crowed on a visit to his labs in the 80s. It had come to photograph him in the company of a few of the millions of tiny particles \u2014 microbeads \u2014 he had invented. Prior to Ugelstad, it had been assumed that the only way to make tiny plastic polymers spherical was to do it in the weightlessness of space \u2014 the ones made on Earth had come out as useless droopy plastic souffl\u00e9s.",
        "I\u2019ll let you in on a secret: I have never seen any of the Star Wars films. Perhaps more egregious still: I have zero desire to see any of the Star Wars films. And yet I feel the death of Carrie Fisher as keenly as any fan. Because Carrie Fisher was so much more than Princess Leia \u2014 although that may come as a surprise to editors at the Mirror who saw fit to headline its front page: \u201cPrincess Leia dead at 60. \u201d Carrie Fisher died at 60. Carrie Fisher the actor, sure.",
        "Barack Obama has suggested the Dakota Access pipeline could be rerouted around sacred Native American lands in comments that are the president\u2019s first on the controversial oil project since police arrested hundreds of indigenous protesters during violent clashes.",
        "New satellite images of North Korean prison camps have been released, showing the continued existence of political prison camps described by the United Nations as being used to perpetrate \u201cunspeakable atrocities\u201d. North Korea\u2019s government denies such camps exist, but new analysis from human rights groups shows several of these camps, also known as kwanliso, have been maintained and expanded since being the subject of the 2014 UN inquiry.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s detractors have struggled to define him as long as he\u2019s been on the political scene. But in 2015 it was the famously Rick Perry who landed upon what seemed like the most accurate descriptor to date: he called Trump \u201ca cancer\u201d. He was speaking in reference to conservatism and, rather amazingly, would later go on to support Trump he was also on to something. We know how cancer cells evade the body\u2019s natural response by basically disarming the immune system \u2014 turning it off or otherwise poisoning it."
