        "Authorities say they \u2019 ve found what they believe is a methamphetamine lab under the parking lot of a Walmart store in southern New York. Researchers in the town of Amherst say officers on routine duty found chemicals and other material used to make meth in an open culvert that runs below the parking lot in suburban Buffalo. Officers say the culvert is tall enough for a person to stand up in. Police and fire crews on campus removed several jars of frozen meth from a manhole that \u2019 s accessible from the culvert.",
        "Alleys, imperial parks, concrete sprawl, Old Beijingers have a habit of keeping caged birds that even \u2014 their bright, melodic chirps are a constant call, even if you \u2019 re not an early riser. In the narrow hutongs, their tones blend alongside the boisterous conversations of visitors, the thick Beijing accent unmistakable anywhere. But these oases are pretty far away from Beijing : bad urban environments from the Mao era mean that huge roads run across the fabric of the city, so the sound of cars is a hazard in the capital.",

Justin Brown, a lawyer representing Syed, wrote in a motion made on Monday that Syed should be released while awaiting retrial because he poses \u201c no danger to the community \u201d. Brown also noted that his client had recently served 17 years in jail \u201c based on an unconstitutional warrant for a crime he did not commit \u201d.

        "The lack of transparency around the processes of Google \u2019 s search engine has been a preoccupation among scholars since the company began. Long before Google expanded into cars, smartphones and ubiquitous technology, the company was being asked to establish the principles and ideologies that determine how it publishes information to us. And now, 10 years later, the impact of subjective, subjective and inflammatory misinformation shown up on the web is being felt almost never before in the digital world. Google responded to media coverage this week by immediately acknowledging and then removing offensive autosuggest results for certain search results.",
        "Medieval manuscripts that have been hidden from view for generations could reveal their secrets for the first time, due to new technology. Computer scientists and other academics are applying an technique to read images of manuscripts that have been reused as bookbindings and which cannot be deciphered with the naked eye. After the middle century manuscripts were recycled, with notes pasted inside bindings to strengthen them. Those fragments may be the unique origin of certain works. Dr Erik Kwakkel, a medieval art historian at Leiden University, told the Observer : \u201c It \u2019 s something like a treasure trove. It \u2019 s really exciting.",

        "Do you ever ponder the real reality headset you agreed to receive at the start of 2016 and think : \u201c surely, this thing will never run off \u201d? Too unrealistic. Too many daft situations. It would have stated clearly on the screen that it would \u201c heighten \u201d everyday situation \u2014 but it still promised to let the real world \u201c at hand in some vaguely plausible way \u201d. Now look around.",
        "A video apparently showing the aftermath of a fatal police shooting during a traffic stop in Minnesota has sparked outrage after being circulated online. Police have confirmed a man was shot by an officer while inside a car with a woman and a child, with local reports saying Philando Castile, 32, died from his wounds.

        "In any list of reasons for the present popularity and high financial standing of golf, the name, and the game, of Arnold Palmer are irresistibly linked. Palmer, who has died aged 87, was one of the most charismatic golfers ever to play the game, a man\u2019s man who was adored by women and a player for whom no play was ever impossible. He got into, and out of, more trouble on the course than any of his championship winning peers, and so outrageous were some of his recovery shots that he quickly attracted a huge following.",
        "Jewish Democrats have widely condemned a party official\u2019s email that sought to question Bernie Sanders\u2019 religious faith. They insist that the issue is irrelevant to how they cast their vote, though they are doubtful as to whether the US is ready to elect its first atheist president. Emails released by WikiLeaks show that Brad Marshall, chief financial officer of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) considered raising the question of whether Sanders is an atheist in the hope of costing him votes in the primary contest against Hillary Clinton.",
        "The prospect of Europe\u2019s febrile politics being injected with another dose of Greek summer drama has been averted after creditors signed off on billions of euros of bailout loans that will enable Athens to make imminent debt repayments. After months of negotiations over the terms of the \u20ac86bn (\u00a368bn) rescue programme thrashed out last year, the country\u2019s third, eurozone lenders said Greece had made enough policy progress to warrant the disbursement of further aid.

He got choked up, he says. \u201cBut it was just one small example of all the people who have contributed to our success. I\u2019m responsible for where we screwed up. All the successes are shared. .. On his way out, Obama is asked whether it was his last news conference. He said he\u2019ll see. Mele Kalikimaka, Obama says. Merry Christmas, in Hawaii.",
        "Gene Wilder was a smart, industrious and often very funny actor and writer who earned a cult status as the weirdo chocolate mogul Willy Wonka in the Roald Dahl adaptation Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971). His sharp, handsome face with intense blue eyes became more as he got older and he had a regular paycheck by teaming up with Richard Pryor in broad comedies like Silver Streak and Stir Crazy \u2014 a which perhaps showed neither to his full potential.",
        "Amy Adams leads Denis Villeneuve\u2019s brainy drama Arrival, which had its North American premiere at the Telluride film festival on Saturday, but she often prefers being a supporting player. During a tribute to the actor that preceded the screening, Adams took part in a discussion which focused on her ability to invest the smallest roles with considerable interior life. Adams has been nominated for the best supporting actress Oscar four times (for Junebug, Doubt, The Fighter and The Master) \u2014 most recently she also netted her first leading Oscar nod for American Hustle.",

        "Not long ago, Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) was considered a fringe attraction. Those days are long gone. A group of investors are buying the mixed martial arts promotion company for an astounding $4bn, in a deal announced this week. This has cemented UFC\u2019s place in the sports industry for the foreseeable future. The current UFC owners, the Fertitta brothers, were able to purchase the company in 2001 for just $2m. At the time, Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) as most people call the sport, was widely scorned.",
        "Among Republican strategists \u2014 the kind of political hacks who have actually worked on successful presidential campaigns \u2014 there has long been some serious about the Democratic response to Donald Trump. Why portray him as the scariest man alive? Why treat him as if his random brain farts will become reality? \u201cDemocrats are taking Trump way too seriously,\u201d one veteran GOP consultant told me at the Republican convention in Cleveland. \u201cIf you say he\u2019ll destroy the world, that means you think he\u2019s going to do what he says he\u2019ll do. A more powerful attack is to say he\u2019s fake.",
        "Michigan\u2019s attorney general on Wednesday filed a lawsuit against companies linked to the Flint water crisis, saying their role caused the debacle to \u201coccur, continue, and worsen\u201d. The lawsuit pinning at least some blame on corporations for Flint\u2019s lead contamination unleashed a bitter battle between the state and Lockwood, Andrews Newnam (LAN). According to the complaint by Michigan\u2019s attorney general, Bill Schuette, LAN failed to implement corrosion control, a treatment for pipes that prevents lead from leaching into the water supply. The absence of the treatment was identified as the primary cause of the city\u2019s lead contamination.",

In Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, the host spoke of the \u201cedifying orgy of media speculation\u201d over the FBI investigating newly discovered emails related to Hillary Clinton\u2019s personal server. Bee ridiculed the media coverage \u2014 and also Donald Trump\u2019s claim that the content of the emails would be \u201cdevastating\u201d. \u201cDamn, Donald missed the mark so badly on Clinton\u2019s emails, they could have been one of his casinos,\u201d she said.",
        "An ambitious, almost fantastical, manifestation of agricultural technology is expected to come to fruition this fall. From the remains of an abandoned steel mill in Newark, New Jersey, the creators of AeroFarms are building what they say will be the largest vertical farm, producing two million pounds of leafy greens a year. Whether it even qualifies as a \u201cfarm\u201d is a matter of taste. The greens will be manufactured using a technology called aeroponics, a technique in which crops are grown in vertical stacks of plant beds, without soil, sunlight or water.",
        "The cocktail in the United States is the margarita. But during the run of the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, which continues until 21 August, it may be supplanted by another classic: the caipirinha. You don\u2019t have to dig too deeply into Brazilian drinking habits before you bump into the caipirinha. It\u2019s the national cocktail and is made with Brazil\u2019s most common and popular indigenous spirit: cacha\u00e7a, a distillate. (Don\u2019t call it \u201cBrazilian rum\u201d unless you want to start an argument.",
        "At last, Donald Trump has chosen his understudy for the baroque, idiotic drama that is about to unfold for the next four months of democracy: Indiana governor Mike Pence. And what is a presidential campaign without a cool logo? Our sitting president, Barack Obama, changed the logo game back in 2008 \u2014 making him less a candidate and more a newfangled flavor of soda pop. Hillary Clinton took Obama\u2019s lead and stuck an arrow into the letter H, thereby leading the United States forward. Or signaling a right turn I\u2019m not sure.",
        "In the town where Abraham Lincoln addressed a shattered nation in 1863, Donald Trump gave one of the most detailed policy speeches of his campaign last month. As the US \u2014 and the world \u2014 wait to see which elements of the incoming president\u2019s inflammatory campaign he will attempt to pursue from the White House, this speech may be something of a guide. Alan Yuhas examines the likelihood of each of the 18 presidential acts and 10 bills Trump outlined in Gettysburg becoming reality.",
        "Will the lack of a quarterback send the Broncos from first to worst? Possibly no Super Bowl champion has had a shorter honeymoon than the Broncos, who were blindsided by the departure of their quarterback of the future, Brock Osweiler. While they knew Peyton Manning was probably leaving they expected Osweiler \u2014 who won several games in Manning\u2019s absence \u2014 would keep the offense stable and allow the league\u2019s best defense to make another Super Bowl run. But now that Osweiler is in Houston the Broncos have the problem of matching their elite defense behind an inexperienced quarterback."
