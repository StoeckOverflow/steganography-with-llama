        "A former drag queen has become the 12th celebrity to openly accuse Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump of sexual assault. Ninni Laaksonen, a former Miss Finland in the Miss Universe competition that Trump once owned, alleged in an interview with the Finnish newspaper that Trump groped her before an appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman in 2006. \u201c Before the show we were sitting outside the building, \u201d Laaksonen said, according to a translation supplied by The Telegraph. \u201c Trump walked right next to me and suddenly he squeezed my butt. He literally grabbed my butt.",
        "When the heir to the reigning Italian throne has a Los Angeles hipster vibe and wants to win money, the result is easily foretold : gourmet pasta food truck. Prince Emanuele Filiberto di Savoia, the grandson of Umberto VI, the last reigning king of Italy, has launched a food catering business on the island of LA, bringing truffle linguine to the city. \u201c The best of Italy equals the best of LA, \u201d he tells the Guardian. \u201c It will be delicious.",
        "With Donald Trump in the White House, lawyers from other states may even be able to bring their guns to shops of Fifth Avenue, the plaza at Rockefeller Center and other New York city sights. Advocates say they expect Congress to finally pass a sweeping gun possession law that could dismantle firearms restrictions in states like New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Texas and Hawaii. These changes may come soon.",
        "In November 2015 Donald Trump proclaimed to a crowd of Iowans : \u201c How stupid are the people of Iowa? \u201d Two months earlier he lost the Iowa Republican caucus. Almost a year on he may win the Hawkeye presidency in the presidential election. Republicans have only won Iowa once since President Reagan \u2014 in 2004, when George Clinton eked out a win by 10, 000 of more than 1. 5 million votes. And yet, among the strongest battleground states, Iowa has become perhaps Trump \u2019 s greatest hope of a win.",
        "The Arizona Republic expected to lose weight when it endorsed a Democrat for governor for the first time in its history. The death threats, however, were more of a surprise. \u201c Our sister publication, the Cincinnati Enquirer, had seen subscription loss \u201d after endorsing Hillary Clinton, said Phil Boas, web page editor for the Arizona Republic. \u201c We had a sense of what we were thinking. It was never a part of our decision making. \u201d Boas declined to press about threats against his publication, which was endorsed by a group of GOP politicians and groups called the Arizona Republic.",
        "The common belief to drink plenty of water when ill is based on scant data and can actively harm chances of recovery, doctors have warned. Medics at King \u2019 s College London NHS foundation trust, in London, raised the case after they treated a patient with hyponatremia \u2014 abnormally low sodium \u2014 from drinking too little water to help with a potential urinary tract infection. In the case highlighted, a woman needed several litres of water depending on medical advice she sought from previous similar procedures to \u201c flush out her system \u201d.",
        "In the late 1990s, Tom Bossie overreached in his zealous pursuit of the Clintons and it cost him his job. But after 20 years of investigating the incident, Bossie has once again been summoned to help track down his old foe, Hillary Clinton, this time from the top of a presidential campaign with no time limits. Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he succeeded Bossie as a deputy campaign chairman during an interview with the Washington Post. Trump described Bossie to the press as \u201c a friend of mine for three years. Solid. Beautiful. Loves politics, knows how to win.",
        "The racist comments on Nextdoor. com became so noticeable that they started to make Shikira people feel physically abused. Billed as a \u201c private social resource for your neighborhood \u201d Nextdoor allows readers to write public notices to neighbors who have joined the project, which now has more than 110, 000 local groups throughout the US. After Porter, who is Caucasian, signed up in her Oakland, California, neighborhood in 2013, she quickly learned that many of her white neighbors were posting \u201c crime and police \u201d alerts about \u201c suspicious \u201d people of color.

        "Barack Obama has said the Paris Climate deal could represent a \u201c turning point \u201d in the decision to avoid dangerous global warming, after a flurry of commitments by Iran pushed the agreement into effect. The climate accord is set to be activated on 4 November after the European Union, Canada, Indonesia and India all formally ratified the deal. The latest ratifications state that 73 nations accounting for nearly 57 % of the world \u2019 s greenhouse gas emissions are fully committed to the process, meaning the three key thresholds to the agreement have now been removed.",
        "Two years after the assassination of the Russian Ambassador to Turkey, a piece in New York magazine makes a point that occasionally referenced the aftermath of shocking events : that photos of the killing depended on the quality of art. \u201c In the predominantly white, pristine setting of an upscale photo gallery... with patrons, staff, and victim all dressed in perfect black, the photographs themselves seem strikingly surreal \u2014 uncanny, even \u2014 and, in some very odd ways, beautiful.",
        "Many take the stereotype that men and women conduct salary negotiations very differently. The conventional wisdom is that after only a few days on the job, men will waltz into their employer \u2019 s office unannounced, slam their end of the table and demand more salary. This chutzpah, of course, results in a war. Meanwhile women who have worked for 10 years at the same company would feel undeserving of a salary. \u201c I don \u2019 t want to come across as crazy, \u201d they say to each other wistfully over crantinis. \u201c I still have so little to learn.",
        "Three years ago, James Comey was director of Donald Trump \u2019 s Bureau of Washington corruption and a strict enforcer of \u201c the highest integrity \u201d to Hillary Clinton \u2019 s campaign. On CNN, the FBI director was the most controversial figure in the capital, unpredictable to Trump, irresponsible to Clinton and puzzling to almost everyone. Comey has a long tradition of trying to walk along tightropes, to varying success, dating to the earliest days of his life.",
        "The first time Tameeka Bennett had to drive several hours in traffic to get to her job in East Palo Alto, she broke down in tears in her office. It was October 2014, and Bennett, 29, had always imagined she would have to move away from the Silicon Valley city where she grew up, which is one of the least affluent cities in the region. But her family had lost their home to foreclosure, and they couldn \u2019 t find an affordable house to buy in East Palo Alto.",
        "I have driven by many roadside zoos in my time, but have never stopped at one. It seemed unlikely they could be any less depressing than a conventional zoo \u2014 in fact, it seemed likely that they could be even more depressing. Roadside zoos generally provide less enrichment for the animals and less education for their public. While conventional zoos have moved to enclosures for animals for at least part of the day, animals at some roadside zoos can spend their entire lives in a cage. The difference between the two is not euphemistic.",
        "A popular perception is that the NFL\u2019s Thursday night games \u2014 broadcast on the league\u2019s own NFL Network and recently described by the Seattle Seahawks\u2019 Richard Sherman as a \u201cpoopfest\u201d \u2014 are a product of greed. This is not entirely true. Thursday Night Football had a lot more to do with power and leverage than a simple sniff at the money. This week the Giants play the Eagles in what could be the final ever, regular Thursday night telecast. Recently, Profootballtalk.",
        "Cave lions might have been hunted to extinction by humans, according to researchers who say they have found evidence that the creatures were skinned for their pelts 16, 000 years ago. Larger than an African lion, but thought to lack a mane, cave lions were hunted by Neanderthals, with some evidence that Homo sapiens occasionally also killed the animals, alongside other more carnivores. But now a team of researchers from Spain say they have found evidence that humans were skinning the creatures around 16, 000 years ago.",
        "A toddler has been rescued after three days alone in a forest that is home to bears and wolves in southern Siberia. Tserin Dopchut sparked a huge land and air search when he wandered into the woodland on Sunday 18 September, the Siberian Times reported. He had been playing with dogs under the supervision of his near his home in Khut, a village of around 400 people in the district of the Tuva republic.",
        "Presidents of Mexico do not wake up thinking how to \u201cscrew\u201d the country, the current office holder Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto said on Tuesday, seeking to defend his record in government and encourage positive thinking. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s reputation has been dented by abuses by security forces, scandals and political corruption. It took a fresh hit this summer when he hosted the US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in Mexico City on 31 August for a hastily arranged visit that surprised many members of his cabinet.",
        "USA are out of the Olympic Games following a dramatic penalty shootout defeat against Sweden, led by the champions\u2019 former coach Pia Sundhage. The Swedes emerged winners in the first ever shootout in Olympic women\u2019s soccer, with the scores after extra time in a keenly contested in Brasilia. Alex Morgan, who levelled for the US in regulation, and Christen Press missed the crucial before Lisa Dahlqvist ignored Hope Solo\u2019s histrionics to end the USA\u2019s bid for a fourth consecutive gold medal and a fifth straight final. Solo took defeat badly, calling Sweden \u2018a bunch of cowards\u2019 after the defeat.",
        "Russia has threatened to launch \u201c \u201d cruise missile and airstrikes on Aleppo to coincide with the US election, according to media reports from Moscow. The strikes, predicted in the 24 hours from Tuesday morning, would be targeted at the outskirts of the city where rebel groups have been seeking to break the Assad regime\u2019s siege of eastern districts. They would involve cruise missiles, and warplanes, the reports said. A military source told the Gazeta.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be the first person to mention the name,\u201d said the writer Moustafa Bayoumi as he brought up Donald Trump during the Terror, Threats and Fear panel at the Brooklyn book festival on Sunday, attributing the resurgence of fringe groups to the rise of the Republican candidate. In this context, he said, he preferred the term \u201cTrumpism, rather than Trump\u201d.",
        "On a stormy night, when the wind\u2019s whipping the Oregon coast at 100mph, you can hear the glass walls flex in Ryan Finley\u2019s house. \u201cI love the feeling that you\u2019re in this envelope of protection with a tempest going on outside,\u201d he says. There\u2019s a magical feel in the air. This northerly part of the West Coast has less sunshine and more unpredictable weather than California does. It\u2019s about bald eagles and wild elk here, not surfers or bodybuilders. This is where the opening scene in The Goonies is shot, where Jacob chats up Bella in Twilight.",
        "The Syrian agreement is ambitious, full of pitfalls and the best hope for a resumption of the ceasefire and peace talks in Syria. The kernel of the agreement, reached after 13 hours of talks in Geneva on Friday, is a staged ceasefire, a reopening of humanitarian aid, followed by a grounding of the Syrian air force in those areas dominated by opposition fighters recognised by the west. A specific plan has been set out on how to deliver aid to the 250, 000 citizens of Aleppo who are running out of water and fuel.",
        "The 7th of January is a date ingrained in Dr Umar Shah\u2019s mind. He heads the county health department that serves Houston, Texas, America\u2019s city. Days before, he had received an unusual phone call. \u201cOur infectious disease staff said: \u2018We have a suspected case of Zika,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we sort of scratched our heads and said, \u2018Really? \u2019\u201d As most Houstonians celebrated the holidays, staff members confirmed the diagnosis with an outside lab. The process took days.",
        "If you\u2019re feeling higher levels of stress on election day, you may want to check your saliva. A group of neuroscientists and political scientists have pioneered a new field called biopolitics, the study of biology and political behavior. One recent study that analyzed saliva to measure stress levels found that people with higher levels of stress may be less likely to vote. The study by Dr Jeffrey French, a psychologist at the University of and Kevin Smith, a political scientist at the University of looked at stress and voting by analyzing cortisol, a hormone we release when we\u2019re stressed.",
        "Tiger Woods is scheduled to make his comeback to competitive golf at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas next month. Woods has not played since August 2015, and three weeks ago pulled out of the Safeway Open, claiming \u201cmy game is vulnerable and it\u2019s not where it needs to be. \u201d But in a press release on Tuesday, Woods, who has plummeted to No831 in the world rankings, said he would be back to play on 1 December.",
        "Trump voters sure are sensitive lately. They\u2019re upset that the cast of the hit play Hamilton made a statement to Mike Pence, and that the audience booed him. They\u2019re displeased that their vote is costing them relationships with family and friends. And for some reason not entirely clear to me, they\u2019re unhappy with Starbucks and decided to demonstrate as much by \u2026 buying lots of coffee at Starbucks. The same people who wear shirts that read \u201cfuck your feelings\u201d and rail against \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d seem to believe that there should be no social consequences for their vote.",
        "Brazilian troops have begun patrolling Olympic venues in an attempt to reassure athletes and visitors about a public security situation that even the Rio de Janeiro mayor has described as \u201chorrible, terrible\u201d. With one month until the opening ceremony, rising crime and falling police budgets have pushed their way to the front of a long list of concerns, which also include water pollution, the Zika epidemic, recession and political turmoil.",
        "The first of the funerals had just finished. As people piled flowers at the shooting site \u2014 a gas station parking lot \u2014 Umar Shabazz Bey looked on, feeling suspicious. He dwells in a world of suspicion. Not suspicion for the mourners, or for horror at the killing the week before of three Baton Rouge police officers. He was clear on that. He refused to even speak the shooter\u2019s name. But the official account made no sense, he said. He pointed to a neighboring car wash. \u201cThere were reports of somebody shooting from the roof at Benny\u2019s,\u201d he said.",
        "At least seven civilians have been killed in two separate bomb attacks blamed on Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) militants in Turkey. A regional security force said four were killed on Wednesday in a car bomb attack in the centre of the city of Diyarbakir, and three lost their lives in a bombing in Kiziltepe in Mardin province to the south. Both bomb attacks had been aimed at passing police vehicles, the Do\u011fan news agency said. NTV television said 25 people were wounded in the Mardin attack and 13 in Diyarbakir."
