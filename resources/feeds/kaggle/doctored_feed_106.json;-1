        "There may never be enough hours in the world to get everything together, but at least the forces of gravity are conspiring to help out. Astronomers who compiled nearly 3, 000 years of celestial history have found that with every passing century, the day on earth lengthens by two milliseconds as the planet \u2019 s surface gradually winds down.",
        "The former pushed forward Cuauht\u00e9moc Blanco declared a hunger strike on October, to protest an impeachment process that attempted to remove him as mayor of the municipality of Cuernavaca, a state capital opposite Mexico City. The vote to unseat Blanco, who became Mayor of Cuernavaca in December, was approved on December by the Morelos state legislature and was transferred to state supreme court judges who are expected to make a ruling in early November.",
        "Bruce Springsteen \u2019 s bout with depression has taken him to the brink of tears, the singer will tell Kirsty sometime before she leaves him to fend for himself with only eight weeks for company on BBC Radio 4 \u2019 s Desert Island Discs. \u201c It is loneliness that has been a part of my life, \u201d Springsteen telling Young for the show to be repeated on Sunday. \u201c It is usually Sunday, but like Churchill \u2019 s \u2018 little dog \u2019 it still shows up and bites you in the arse sometimes.",
        "To make decisions about what a certain group of voters are thinking, pollsters need to speak to enough people from that group. Generally speaking, though, the smaller the group, the easier it is to get respondents. That \u2019 s why, when they \u2019 re gauging opinion among different racial categories, pollsters rarely manage to go further down the list beyond black ( approximately 69 % of all voters ) Asian ( 12 % ) or Hispanic ( 12 % ). But that last 7 % is a larger share of the electorate that sometimes gets lumped together under the name \u201c other \u201d.",
        "Usain Bolt has criticised Rio 2016 organisers after winning his third consecutive Olympic 100m title, arguing that the contracted rest interval between the and the final affected his fitness. The Jamaican, who beat the veteran Justin Gatlin into silver just as he did 12 weeks ago at the world championships in Beijing, praised the huge crowd but called on organisers to limit the amount of time between medals. \u201c It did affect me a little bit. My legs kind of seemed dead at the start.",
        "After years of hibernation, will the US economy rouse itself for a big change over the next couple of months? With an incoming Republican governor hellbent on reflating an economy already near full employment, and with severe trade restrictions picking up the price of goods, and with prices likely to come under threat, higher inflation \u2014 possibly exceeding 3 % at times \u2014 is a. And price growth could start as well, possibly exceed 4 % at least temporarily. Dare you say? Not at all. The economy still seems to be growing at a 3 % yearly clip.",
        "The pay disparity in Major League Soccer was left bare on Thursday as MLS released its biannual salary reports \u2014 which showed how the league \u2019 s top 20 players receive approximately 50 % of all guaranteed salary cuts. The best paid player in MLS is Orlando City \u2019 s Kak\u00e1, with nearly $ 7. 2m guaranteed for this year. Sebastian Giovinco, Michael Ball, Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard came next, each with guaranteed salary of more than $ 6m. David Villa, Sergio Pirlo and Clint Dempsey earn more than $ 4m each, while David Howard should do well at Grand Rapids, with more than $ 2.",
        "I studied Russian politics at college, and the last thing I did when I finished was travel to Ukraine. The Soviet Union had just collapsed and I wanted to understand what was happening to the proletariat \u2014 especially the Russian \u2014 in the Donbass region, now Ukraine \u2019 s rustbelt. I lived with a mining family and ruined their lives. It turned into a crisis. Ukrainian politics can be quite murky. I kept an eye on it all over the country.",
        "The taco, in both its bowl and its big truck form, is having a surreal moment. On Thursday, Jorge Guti\u00e9rrez, a founder of the Latinos for Trump group ( yikes ) said on MSNBC that if Donald Trump loses in November, there would be \u201c taco trucks on every major \u201d. I must spell out that he viewed this as a negative thing and not, as it would seem on the face of it, a valid reason to vote for Obama. \u201c My culture is a very dominant culture, \u201d he told a horrified Laura Reid, who was filling in for Michael Hayes.",
        "Steven Spielberg \u2019 s credentials as a is beyond dispute. As a soothsayer, though, his credentials are shakier. In 2013, he predicted that the new movie was heading for the boneyard. \u201c There \u2019 s going to be an implosion where three or four or even even a megabudget movies are going to go crashing into the wall, \u201d he said, \u201c and that \u2019 s going to change the paradigm. \u201d He reiterated that prediction next year : \u201c We were around when the director died and there will be a time when the Hollywood movie goes the way of the western.",
        "On 13 November 2015, Islamist militants struck France, in and in general, in a way we had never been experienced before. Following the bloody, bloody attacks of January 2015, against Charlie Hebdo, police in Paris and Montrouge, and against a kosher kitchen at the Porte de Vincennes, this time the terrorists sought to kill indiscriminately, and as innocent people as possible. Their aim was to strike fear into us as a whole, by taking aim at our young people and our communities.",
        "Pavlina Pi\u017eova, the Czech skier who survived a month in the New Zealand wilderness, has told how she endured three months in the open in freezing rain conditions before managing to gain shelter at a mountain top. Pi\u017eova, 33, and her partner Ondrej Petr, 27, began running the famous Routeburn track in Fiordland Country Park in the South West on 26 July.

        "The world\u2019s first passenger drone capable of autonomously carrying a person in the air for 23 minutes has been given clearance for testing in Nevada. Chinese firm Ehang, which unveiled the electric Ehang 184 passenger drone at CES in Las Vegas in January, has partnered with the Nevada Institute for Autonomous Systems (NIAS) and the Governor\u2019s Office of Economic Development (Goed) to put the drone through testing and regulatory approval.",
        "Iraq has hanged 36 men convicted over the massacre of hundreds of military recruits by Sunni jihadis and allied militants in 2014. The men had been found guilty of involvement in the Speicher massacre, named after a base near Tikrit where up to 1, 700 recruits were kidnapped before being killed. Islamic State claimed responsibility. Abdelhassan Dawood, a spokesman for the governor\u2019s office in Dhiqar province, said on Sunday: \u201cThe executions of 36 convicted over the Speicher crime were carried out this morning in Nasiriyah prison.",
        "What\u2019s that you say? Another social media furore surrounding the election? Well, of course. This time, it\u2019s New Balance trainer fans unhappy that comments from the company seemed to show support for Donald Trump. New Balance\u2019s head of public affairs, Matthew LeBretton, told the Wall Street Journal a day after the election: \u201cThe Obama administration turned a deaf ear to us, and, frankly, with Trump, we feel things are going to move in the right direction. \u201d Dude, read the room.",
        "In a deposition released on Friday afternoon, Donald Trump acknowledged that his infamous statement that Mexico was deliberately sending rapists into the United States was planned in advance. In testifying in June in an ongoing court case, prompted when restaurateur Geoffrey Zakarian pulled out of a lease in Trump\u2019s Washington hotel after the presidential candidate\u2019s remarks caused a national furor, Trump insisted his comments were not . However, he made clear that they weren\u2019t scripted and said that he did not anticipate any damage to his brand.",
        "At 95 years old, Mad Magazine\u2019s Al Jaffee is the oldest working cartoonist, and he has the certificate from Guinness World Records to prove it. The satirist has worked with everyone from Stan Lee to EC Comics founder William Gaines over his career\u2019s span, though he will probably go down in comics history as the inventor of the \u201c \u201d a transformable painting that originally mocked lavish centerfolds in magazines like National Geographic and Playboy and later became Jaffee\u2019s calling card.",
        "The Stanley Cup final is here, with the Pittsburgh Penguins facing the San Jose Sharks in a matchup of two highly skilled and entertaining teams. If Monday night\u2019s opening game was any indication, this should be a fun series. And as with all Cup finals, there will be plenty of brand new fans tuning in for the very first time to see the NHL put its best foot forward. If you\u2019re one of those new fans, have no fear. Hockey can be a confusing sport, especially for newcomers.",
        "Joe Arpaio, the controversial sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, who has been charged with criminal contempt in a racial discrimination case, is preparing to deploy his deputies at polling stations on election day in a move that voting rights activists warn amounts to intimidation.

        "In light of Donald Trump\u2019s \u201claw and order\u201d speech at the Republican national convention, Jon Stewart offered a strong riposte to the idea that patriotism only belonged to Republicans. We asked you for your thoughts on the matter \u2014 whether you identify as a patriot, what it means, and how your beliefs translate into actions in your everyday life. Your answers are below. Patriotism takes hard, thoughtful, informed, dedicated, humble, steady work.",
        "The British mapping agency Ordnance Survey has created an map of Mars\u2019 surface using Nasa open data. The map \u2014 posted to Flickr on Friday \u2014 covers 3. 8m sq miles or approximately 7% of the red planet\u2019s surface. It was produced to a scale of one to 4m. The landing sites of past rovers are featured on the map, including the Mars Pathfinder in Ares Vallis and the Opportunity rover, east of Margaritifer Terra. Cartographic designer Chris Wesson \u201cdesigned the map over a couple of months\u201d according to the Ordnance Survey blog.",
        "Tony Schwartz\u2019s former editor has a nickname for him. \u201cHe\u2019s Dr Frankenstein,\u201d was how Edward Kosner put it in the New Yorker. In fairness, there have been many Dr Frankensteins behind the rise and rampage of Donald Trump. They\u2019ve included the Republican party, with its years of divisiveness and racially charged rhetoric the media, with its collective chase of the next shiny object and the baby boomers feeling the cultural and economic ground give way. But it was Schwartz who sparked this strange political creature into life.",
        "Officials in south Texas have voted to opt out of the family detention business, citing concerns about security and the impact on local infrastructure. A South oil company that owns a former worker camp in Dimmit County had pitched it as a \u201c \u201d facility that could provide dramatically better conditions than two other family detention facilities nearby with more than 2, 000 beds. But after just one meeting Monday, county commissioners unanimously rejected it.",
        "Paul Feig\u2019s reboot of Ghostbusters has failed to top the US box office with a lukewarm $46m opening weekend. The comedy horror, starring Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig, will need to impress international audiences to warrant its $144m budget. Analysts suggest that it will need to make around $300m globally to break even. After almost two years of online anger from fans over the choice to cast four women in the lead roles, the audience was 57% female \u2014 a high number for a blockbuster.",
        "in an ancient ocean on Mars may have shaped the landscape and left deposits that hint at whether the planet was once habitable, researchers say. The giant waves, thought to have reached up to 120 metres in height as they raced over the land, could have been triggered by two large meteorites slamming into the surface. The tsunamis may been powerful enough to shape much of the ancient coastlines on Mars, said J. Alexis Palmero Rodriguez, of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, who led the study.",
        "At the dispatch box for the last time, David Cameron departed much as he had governed, a little blase, with nothing memorable to say, nor even a ringing phrase. He will miss the roar of the crowd. \u201cNothing is really impossible if you put your mind to it\u201d was his final banality, as he bequeathed a score of impossible tasks left undone. Perhaps the man who sauntered effortlessly along a privileged path to the highest office never really tried hard enough, chillaxing and busking his way through six years.",
        "I\u2019m not much of a fan of the original 1988 Alan Bolland graphic novel The Killing Joke. But I was blown away by just how wretchedly awful the cartoon remake \u2014 previewed at and with a limited cinema release on Monday \u2014 is. Director Sam Liu and writer Brian Azzarello have added a half hour of new story on to the beginning of the narrative, in which they methodically turn Batgirl into a clumsy agglomeration of misogynist tropes.",
        "Thousands of civilians have been evacuated from besieged east Aleppo and thousands more are preparing to leave under a truce deal. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, 5, 000 civilians left the besieged districts in 75 buses on Monday. Another 25 buses were ready to take more people to the town of Rashideen in countryside to the west of the city. \u201cThese were the worst days we endured,\u201d said Abu Jaafar, a doctor who left the city and arrived in Rashideen on Monday.",
        "Whatever the motives of the who shot 10 people dead \u2014 including himself \u2014 in Munich on Friday night, Europe\u2019s third violent attack on civilians in eight days risks further shaking an already fractured and fearful continent at a time when it least needs it. German authorities said on Saturday it was premature to call the shooting in the Bavarian state capital a terrorist attack, and have uncovered no evidence that the teenage gunman, who had been receiving psychiatric and medical treatment, had links to any Islamist group.",
        "\u201cThat was 40 years ago,\u201d sighs Chrissie Hynde with what can only be described as an auditory eye roll. \u201cI\u2019ve talked about starting this band so much, I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m talking about now. \u201d While Hynde\u2019s band the Pretenders are part of an increasingly small number of groups still working after four decades, Hynde is not one to dwell on the past. She has little use for nostalgia, especially when the Pretenders have a new album out, Alone, and the group is touring through North America with Stevie Nicks."
