        "In the Hall of Canada and Pakistan, on the first floor of the offices of the Royal Navy members club, a single male, elderly couple of about a hundred drank coffee, ate chocolate chip cookies, and badmouthed the new twenty one enemies of Islam : British judges. The protest was a hastily organised \u201c Brexit party \u201d near central London \u2019 s Green Park. A small sale in the corner of the hall, hosted by the Thatcherite Bruges Group, offered a taste of the views faced by many in the room. John Scholefield and Gerald Frost \u2019 s Too \u2018 Men \u2019 to be Tories?",
        "A casting search for a new project led by Quentin Tarantino has caused concern after a Facebook post suggested \u201c whores \u201d to apply. The post, which has since been deleted, appeared on a hiring agency page and said : \u201c Casting Whores for Quentin Tarantino project \u201d. The director later requested that all characters have \u201c natural breasts \u201d and should put the word \u201c whore \u201d in the story line. Women and kids contacted the agency, which has allegedly been in trouble for similar situations in the past.",
        "Overheard outside the Wells Fargo Center in Minneapolis a few months ago : Section A : \u201c Philly \u2019 s a shitty city. All we have is cheesesteak and Rocky. \u201d Avenue B : \u201c Yeah. And the pride of the nation. \u201d This conversation, recorded by historian Bryant Miller, captures something of the wry, earthy, vibrant and frank city hosting this week \u2019 s Democratic national campaign. In Philadelphia there is no escaping cheesesteak, the type conceived by hot dog vendor Pat Olivieri for his drunk driver customers in 1930, or worse, the boxing movie director Sylvester Stallone.",
        "In the oil industry Chevron commissioned a series of educational television and print commercials to convince the public of its perceived bonafides. Titled People Do, the campaign showed Chevron employees protecting turtles, butterflies, sea lions and all manner of cute and cuddly babies. The commercials were very effective \u2014 in 1990, they won an Effie Foundation award, and subsequently became a case study at Stanford Business school. They also became notorious amongst environmentalists, who have proclaimed them the gold standard of greenwashing \u2014 the corporate practice of deliberately diverting sustainability claims to justify a questionable environmental statement.",
        "When Angela Carter died \u2014 aged just 51, on 16 March 1992 \u2014 her reputation changed from cultish to controversial. Her obituaries in the British press left more space than any others that followed except Francis Bacon, Willy Brandt and Marlene Dietrich. Their tone was rhapsodic. \u201c Angela Mary \u2026 was one of the most important poets at work in the English press. \u201d \u201c She interpreted the times for years with unrivalled penetration. \u201d \u201c Her imagination was one of the most dazzling of this century.",
        "My goal is a project in which, in cases where it is difficult for the mentally disabled to live at homes and be socially active, they can be euthanised with the help of their guardians. When Uematsu turned himself in, he was found using kitchen knives and other sorts of knives stained with blood. There is never any excuse for such murder, but the fact that this attack occurred at a facility for persons with disability makes it all the more repugnant and senseless.",
        "Carrie Underwood, the actor best known as Princess Leia in Star Wars, has died four months after reportedly suffering a heart attack on a flight from California. We \u2019 d like you to share your tributes and reviews as part of our coverage. Is there a great film performance that means a lot to you? Perhaps you have history, memorabilia or you met her?

        "Joe Biden issued a deeply personal rebuke of Donald Trump while marking his last joint appearance with Hillary Clinton on the campaign floor on Monday, invoking the military career of his late son Clinton to cast the Republican Party as \u201c totally, thoroughly unqualified \u201d to emerge as president. \u201c No major Republican nominee in the history of the United States of America... has known less or been less qualified to deal with our national problem than Donald Trump, \u201d Biden commented in his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, while sharing the stage with Clinton.",
        "National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) officials said on Sunday one data recorder set so far from the New Jersey Transit commuter train that crashed in Hoboken, killing four and injuring more than 100, was not functioning on the day of the accident. On Thursday, a passenger train smashed through a wall and hurtled into the Hoboken station \u2019 s waiting room, killing a woman on the train. The locomotive \u2019 s recorder has recorded on train speed.",
        "Ironically, I am starting to think a bit \u201c left behind \u201d by Nigel Farage. He was pretty busy working as a waitress in a small bar when we met him. ( Perhaps a less elitist backstory to the accurate statement : namely, that he was a City Watch trader. ) But now, like some silly prick who always looks over your shoulder in case someone strange comes along, someone has caught Donald Duck \u2019 s eye and walked off with us. As Alan Partridge almost shouts : \u201c Don! Don! Don! Don! Don! Don! Don!",
        "The flight data recorder of crashed EgyptAir Flight MS804 has been successfully repaired, according to Egyptian authorities, as forensic investigators open a manslaughter investigation into how the jet headed from Beirut to Cairo came down. The jet \u2019 s two recorders \u2014 one containing flight data, the other two voice recordings from the flight deck \u2014 were handed over to technical experts after they were recovered back from the wreckage in the Mediterranean and Israeli investigators could not verify their contents.",
        "The first tornado to strike Florida in 11 days left a messy aftermath of \u201c severe \u201d flooding, downed power lines and roads across the state on record, but initial fears of a large and powerful \u201c \u201d storm appear to have been unfounded. A homeless man lying in the open near Ocala was killed when he was hit by a tree, police said at a morning briefing, but said there were no reports of deaths or serious injuries caused by the storm.",
        "At least 67 people have been killed and another 100 injured after a suicide bomb packed with ball bearings tore through a crowded hospital in Quetta, the capital of a region of Pakistan ravaged by insurgency and sectarian tensions. Witnesses described horrific scenes as victims cried out for help, and survivors scrambled to flee past bodies lying scattered in the corridors .",
        "It\u2019s one of the most universal recommendations in all of public health: floss daily to prevent gum disease and cavities. Except there\u2019s little proof that flossing works. Still, governments, dental organisations and manufacturers of floss have pushed the practice for decades. Dentists provide samples to their patients the British Dental Association insists on its patient website that flossing helps \u201cin the battle against tooth decay and gum disease\u201d. But all this could change following an investigation by Associated Press (AP).",
        "\u201cChina is so big,\u201d marvels Victor Li, using his fingers to count all the cities he has flown to over the last 12 months to meet with Chinese buyers interested in buying into a game of London Monopoly. Li, a director of international project marketing for the US real estate giant CBRE, is predicting a surge of eastern investment in British homes over the next decade, as increasingly affluent Chinese investors acquire a taste for international property. \u201cI think it is just beginning,\u201d says Li, of the amount of money pouring into property around the world from mainland China.",
        "Perhaps she was a tragic figure, or a clinical case worthy of Oliver Sacks, or the incarnation of a dishonest middlebrow culture. But in the end, Stephen Frears\u2019s enjoyable, sentimental movie turns this bizarre figure into a version of Eddie the Eagle, swooping and crashing through New York\u2019s high society in the 1940s. And as with Eddie, the question is \u2026 do we laugh with or laugh at? Which is the more honest response?",
        "The Obama administration could end its use of private immigration detention centres, the US homeland security secretary, Jeh Johnson, said on Monday. The announcement follows a landmark decision by the US Department of Justice to phase out private prisons, after a stinging independent review found they were drastically less safe than publicly operated centres. The move, made earlier in August, led to intense pressure on the homeland security department to conduct a similar review, as it relies more heavily on the use of privatised facilities.",
        "The Federal Reserve\u2019s decision not to increase rates in September was a close call, the minutes released on Wednesday show. When the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) met in September, three of the 12 members voted in favor of increasing interest rates as the US labor market continued to improve at a slower rate and the risks from Brexit, the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, eased. Some members indicated that a rate hike might be appropriate \u201crelatively soon\u201d. Up until September, Kansas City Fed president Esther George was the lone voice in favor of raising interest rates.",
        "It wasn\u2019t the homecoming Logan Stieber had in mind when he returned from Budapest on Monday after winning his first world championship. The Ohio native had only just landed in Columbus when he discovered the gold medal he\u2019d won by defeating Georgia\u2019s Beka Lomtadze in Saturday\u2019s 61kg final had been stolen. Stieber sent out a tweet on Monday night saying that his girlfriend\u2019s car window had been broken and a black backpack containing his medal, belt, passport, iPad, keys and headphones was stolen while they were at dinner.",
        "When Sarah Paulson won a lead actress Emmy, her first, on Sunday, for her role as Marcia Clark in The People v OJ Simpson, her girlfriend, actor Holland Taylor, tweeted: \u201cStill in New York. Still swooning. @MsSarahPaulson. \u201d She wasn\u2019t the only one swooning. Lesbians everywhere were, or screaming \u2014 girly shrieking at the TV in delight. And pride.",
        "Pregnancy appears to trigger changes in brain structure, researchers have revealed, suggesting that the transformations could boost a mother\u2019s ability to care for her newborn baby. The study, based on brains scans, found that the volume of grey matter in certain regions of the brain decreased in women who had been pregnant \u2014 a shift that was found to last for at least two years. \u201cThese changes were remarkably consistent,\u201d said Elseline Hoekzema, of the research from Leiden University.",
        "How to cover the rise of a political leader who\u2019s left a paper trail of racism and the encouragement of violence? Does the press take the position that its subject acts outside the norms of society? Or does it take the position that someone who wins a fair election is by definition \u201cnormal\u201d because his leadership reflects the will of the people? These are the questions that confronted the US press after the ascendance of fascist leaders in Italy and Germany in the 1920s and 1930s.",
        "Pep Guardiola is not used to going a month without a victory but a frustrating period for Manchester City continues. Southampton produced a disciplined and dynamic display to deny City a first win since late September on an afternoon John Stones will want to forget. An error from the England handed Nathan Redmond a goal in the first half, the defender woefully misplacing a pass, and an effort of his own was ruled out moments later.",
        "Michigan\u2019s attorney general escalated a battle over alleged social media threats against police on Wednesday, filing felony terrorist charges over comments on Facebook that mentioned killing white police officers. The charges against Detroit resident Nheru Gowan Littleton carry sentences of 20 years each, and test the limits of free speech protections for online threats. Michigan attorney general Bill Schuette\u2019s office said Littleton posted a stream of messages, as details emerged about the 8 July shooting in Dallas that left five officers dead and seven wounded. \u201cTo those sniper\u2019s in Texas, I commend your bravery and actions!",
        "Several days into my Greek holiday, I am beginning to feel eerily relaxed. This is partly because our children aren\u2019t with us \u2014 I can\u2019t get used to the fact that when a restaurant lunch comes to \u20ac20 a head, I owe only \u20ac40 \u2014 but also because they aren\u2019t at home, either: two of them are on their own separate travels abroad, so the house is comparatively safe. This state of affairs leaves me with a lot of spare psychic space. When I am not swimming or reading or eating, I occupy myself by hating Donald Trump.",
        "As Marcus Willis, \u00a3 tennis coach from Wokingham, walked on to Centre Court shortly before 5pm on Wednesday to play arguably the greatest tennis player of all time, he raised one arm aloft, beamed from ear to ear, and gave a little shake of the head. Yes, this was really happening. Roger Federer is quite a popular chap at the All England club, but for once the deafening cheers that roared around the court for an hour and 25 minutes during the pair\u2019s encounter were not, for the most part, for him.",
        "Have you ever dreamt about failing an exam? If so, you\u2019re in good company. In a database of surveys that ask if people have ever dreamed about certain topics, 45% of respondents said they\u2019d dreamt about failing an examination. The data also shows that women are more likely than men to have these dreams, suggesting that the oppression of the patriarchy may haunt us in our sleeping thoughts. The database was created by Dr Kelly Bulkeley, a dream researcher and visiting scholar at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California.",
        "I first realised I was living next door to a weekend sublet two years ago. Late one Saturday night I heard boys yelling and loud music, and the thumping against the walls was so hard one of my picture frames fell off and cracked on the floor. I presumed the neighbours had a teenager who was throwing a cheeky party while their parents were away. When it happened again the following weekend I assumed it was a repeat.",
        "A navy research lab is working on a new project that could allow deployed sailors to finally grow fresh vegetables on submarines. Engineering technician and navy veteran Don Holman is testing whether hydroponics can be used to sustain gardens on submarines at the army\u2019s Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center, located on the outskirts of Boston. Fresh vegetables only last the first seven to 10 days of submarine deployment, which tend to be three months. After that, sailors have to resort to frozen fruit and vegetables.",
        "One of the possible candidates to serve in Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet has been photographed carrying documents into a meeting with the that outlined aggressive proposals to bar the entry of Syrian refugees and reinstate a national registry focused on Muslims. Kris Kobach, currently the secretary of state of Kansas, met with Trump in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Sunday as part of an ongoing series of conversations aimed at filling key roles in the pending administration."
