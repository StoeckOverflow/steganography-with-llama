        "Clinton, saying Clinton focused mainly on policy, laying out an ambitious agenda that called for lower income inequality by lowering the minimum wage, expanding the gender pay process and eliminating corporate financial loopholes. But she did not miss the opportunity to look after Donald Trump for being the Democratic nominee in more than 40 years to vote to release his tax returns. The Republican candidate began to put his Democratic opponents on the defensive on the Partnership, asking her to explain why she came out against the Fair trade agreement last year after previously supporting it.",
        "Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, more Americans have received insurance today than anyone before \u2014 20 million more than in 2010. The news this brings that Obamacare insurance premiums are going up an almost 25 % may seem worrisome, but private insurers had initially underestimated costs and placed rates lower than the Congressional Budget Office had forecast. We \u2019 re now seeing a correction. That says, the ACA hasn \u2019 t been an unqualified success. Many states and Americans still don \u2019 t have access to affordable health care. The Obamacare experiment may well prove that there \u2019 s only so much money can do.",
        "Visitors to Barcelona will all sooner or later discover themselves in Antoni Gaud\u00ed \u2019 s fairytale Park G\u00fcell, admiring the view of the park from one of the sinuous benches made up of fragments of coloured paper. For many, the benches of park G\u00fcell are the essence of Gaud\u00ed, but they are in fact the work of another artist and painter, Josep Maria Jujol. \u201c When tourists arrive to Parc G\u00fcell, what do they look at? They look at Jujol \u2019 s works, \u201d says the architect \u2019 s friend, also Josep Maria. \u201c I think, what they most rave about in Gaud\u00ed \u2019 s work is Jujol \u2019 s contribution.",
        "Donald Trump has disavowed the white nationalist organization which dubs itself the \u201c \u201d and which rallied around his opponent, but vigorously defended his longtime campaign chairman and subsequently appointed White House chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, a Democrat accused of fanning the flames of white supremacy. \u201c I don \u2019 t want to energize the people, and I disavow the group, \u201d Trump said at a meeting with a group of New York Times employees, in response to a question from the newspaper \u2019 s executive editor, Tom Baquet.",
        "As goalless draws went this was certainly eventful, with Manchester United going down to 10 men, Tony Mourinho being banished from the sidelines, Tom Heaton running in another inspired goalkeeping error and Burnley picking up their third away point of the game. Yet it was hardly the case the home side were going for it takes United two to square one after their midweek against Leicester City. Mourinho said beforehand he was looking forward to a Sunday off, but relaxation is proving elusive for the manager holed up at Sunderland \u2019 s Lowry hotel.",
        "Donald Trump \u2019 s taped remarks about groping men and using his fame for sex are reflective of \u201c a pattern of verbal assault \u201d Hillary Clinton \u2019 s running mate, Tim Kaine, said Sunday. \u201c It \u2019 s not just politics, \u201d Kaine said in an interview with Time, adding that Trump might explain to American voters in Sunday night \u2019 s Senate debate \u201c why he thought that was inappropriate behavior \u201d. A number of observers, including Jill Harth, who wrote to the Guardian in July, have stated that Trump groped them or behaved in an inappropriate way.",
        "Barack Obama suffered a unique major blow on Wednesday, when the US Congress overturned his veto of a bill that would allow families of the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks to boycott Saudi Arabia. The subsequent bipartisan vote in both the Senate and House inflicted the first constitutional override of Obama \u2019 s presidency, less than four months before he took office. The White House issued an unusually scathing comment. \u201c I would venture to add that this is the single most embarrassing thing that the United States Congress has done, possibly, since 1983, \u201d press secretary Jane Earnest told reporters.",
        "Boxer Tyson Fury has sparked further outrage after using homophobic, sexist and antisemitic comments in an video rant. Fury has previously been accused of sexism and homophobia, especially controversial remarks about former heptathlon champion Jessica.

        "I have always had a morbid fascination about snakes. I was born with a lot of animals, especially elephants, and I began drawing snakes at three years old. I caught my first one when I was five and living in Miami : it was a small, garter snake. Then I began bringing them home and writing about them. My parents tolerated it, and in 1976, when I was 10, they let me have my first boa constrictor. Soon afterwards my dad took me to the Miami Serpentarium, where I met a guy called David Haast, who milked cobras and rattlesnakes.",
        "The 2016 presidential campaign isn \u2019 t turning out to be the Facebook worm, as some people have dubbed it. More than anything else, it \u2019 s now the Election Dominated By Leaks. In the first month of the race, the Bush and Trump campaigns \u2019 Internet attack points now revolve around several major leaks that have targeted their opposing candidate on the Internet. Both campaigns or their supporters have been found encouraging leaks about the other side, while claiming leaks involving them are either legal or illegal.",
        "When Dallas police killed the gunman Micah Johnson with a robot Friday Jones, Johnson became the third person killed by the area \u2019 s police in 2016. That \u2019 s unusual. Of eight departments in the 10 most populous cities in the US, the Dallas Police department is the only one reporting a fatal shooting by homicide so far this year.

        "Attempts to provide poor, pregnant women in Texas with mosquito repellent to avoid possible Zika infections are off to a slow start. Two weeks after the state announced that mosquito repellent would be given out to women and girls on Medicaid, only 1, 200 cans have been distributed, equivalent to less than 1% of the roughly 134, 000 pregnant women eligible for the product. Only 25 cans of mosquito repellent have been given out to the roughly 92, 000 women who qualify for family planning services through the state.",
        "Sometimes I think I have never seen anything as strong as Hillary Clinton. That doesn\u2019t mean that I like and admire everything about her. I\u2019m not here to argue about who she is, just to note what she did. I watched her plow through opposition and attacks the like of which no other candidate has ever faced and still win the popular vote. To defeat her it took an unholy cabal far beyond what Barack Obama faced when he was the campaign of change, swimming with the tide of disgust about the Bush administration.",

The round took Furyk to for the tournament and fifth place in the clubhouse. His first three rounds were a 73, a 66 and a 72. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of rounds by a lot of great players ahead of me that have never reached 58, so to hold that record alone right now, on the PGA Tour at least . .. is phenomenal,\u201d Furyk said.",
        "This should not be news. But in today\u2019s febrile world of headlines, it bears repeating: there are two old people running for president. One is a woman whose legs gave way in the late summer heat on Sunday [Editor\u2019s note: shortly after publication of this article, the Clinton campaign revealed she was suffering from pneumonia]. Hillary Clinton has also coughed a few times on camera. Both events have taken on cosmic significance in this otherwise sedate and stately presidential contest. Four years ago, Clinton fainted and banged her head while sick with a stomach virus.",
        "Constitutional lawyers and White House ethics counsellors from Democratic and Republican administrations have warned Donald Trump his presidency might be blocked by the electoral college if he does not give up ownership of at least some of his business empire. \u201cThe brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before,\u201d Donald Trump told the New York Times on Wednesday, and his election victory buzz does indeed seem to have been good for business.",
        "US Donald Trump would be a \u201cnaive\u201d fool to launch an trade war against China, a Communist newspaper has claimed. During the acrimonious race for the White House Trump repeatedly lashed out at China, vowing to punish Beijing with \u201cdefensive\u201d 45% tariffs on Chinese imports and to officially declare it a currency manipulator. \u201cWhen they see that they will stop the cheating,\u201d the billionaire Republican, who has accused Beijing of \u201cthe greatest theft in the history of the world\u201d told a rally in August. On Monday the Global Times warned that such measures would be a grave mistake.",
        "They said he wrote music to slit your wrists to, which in this week of all weeks feels timely. As it happens, I never felt that barb was fair to Leonard Cohen. True, his songs often told of gloom and defeat and darkness, but his voice was one of consolation \u2014 of sharing the loss by finding another who felt it too, of discovering the glimmer of love or light that might get you through. My word, do we need that now.",

Late Wednesday night came word that Westbrook had agreed to a $86m contract extension with the only professional team he\u2019s ever known \u2014 and on Thursday afternoon it was confirmed. Obviously, Westbrook\u2019s extension is a major victory for the Thunder, a franchise still reeling after Kevin Durant\u2019s shocking departure, but it also should be good news for nearly everyone in the NBA, with the exception of anyone who was expecting their team to make a deal for the point guard.",

We may applaud gold medalists Michael Phelps and Adam Peaty as they scythe through the pool with exquisite hydrodynamic skill, but 54% of Americans would not pass a basic swim test. There\u2019s a potentially fatal disconnect, it seems, between ourselves and the water.",

        "Thousands of Saudis have signed an online petition calling for the government to abolish the country\u2019s guardianship system, which prevents women from engaging in fundamental tasks without the permission of a male relative. \u201cWomen should be treated as a full citizen,\u201d said activist Aziza who, along with other activists, has been fighting against the guardianship system for a decade. \u201cThis is not only a women\u2019s issue, this is also putting pressure on normal men . .. this is not an issue for women only,\u201d she told the Guardian.",
        "Reading the business pages, it would be easy to conclude that it\u2019s shaky times at Ralph Lauren, with sales down 11% in North America in the first quarter of 2016, 8% of its workforce cut this year and 50 stores closing. There was somewhat of a different impression on Wednesday evening at New York fashion week. Lauren still has the clout to close a block of the Upper East Side\u2019s Madison Avenue to stage not one but two fashion shows in a temporary structure erected outside the brand\u2019s flagship store. The concept behind the show was equally confident."
