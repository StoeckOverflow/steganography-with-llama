        "An Iranian sprinter, Bahman Golbarnezhad, has become the first professional athlete to die in sports, after a horrific crash in the men \u2019 s road race in Paris on Saturday. A joint committee involving Rio 2016, the International Paralympic Committee, national police, medical facilities and cycling \u2019 s world governing body, the UCI, has been able to establish the full details of what was described as a tragic accident. The from Shiraz lost control on a descent 35km into the race, at 10. 35am local time, the head of Iran \u2019 s National Paralympic committee ( NPC ) called.",
        "\u201c I do not like talking about injured players, \u201d Roberto Mourinho announced a few months before he joined Real Madrid \u2014 shortly before going on to talk, perhaps darkly, about assorted injured players and one in the process another in a series of similar digressions through the sullen, dying spirit of his time at the Bernab\u00e9u. In reality, of course, the opposite is true. Mourinho enjoys talking about injured fans. Or at least he certainly spends a lot of time doing it.",
        "\u201c Promiscuous already I \u2019 m all are you waiting for? \u201d If you were a pop radio fan 10 years back, those words have probably already got Nelly Furtado and Timbaland \u2019 s 2006 Promiscuous running on loop through your skull. The song has one of those killer hooks that get lodged in your skull for months, usually over a staggering, clapping, boinging Timbaland beat. Timbaland raps on the song as well as produces he and Furtado exchange doofily high single entendre witticisms with the lascivious corniness of a duet.",
        "A US military sailor was sentenced on appeal to a year in prison for releasing photos of classified information inside a nuclear bomber submarine while it was in port in California. Kristian Saucier, of Arlington, Vermont, sued in federal court in Bridgeport, where a jury also ordered him to serve six months of solitary confinement with electronic tape during a period of supervised release after the prison time. He pleaded guilty in May to unauthorized disclosure of defense information and had served five to six months in prison under federal sentencing procedures.",
        "The history could refer to William the Conqueror as jovial and intelligent, among other surprising qualities recorded in an Latin chronicle written after the king \u2019 s death. In fact, historians have thought him wrong. A new edition of the rambling chronicle reveals that such praiseworthy adjectives were directed at someone else completely \u2014 a recently deceased William rather than the late earl. The discovery was made by a local historian, Marc Antony, while researching his forthcoming book on William of Normandy, whose conquest of England in 1066 changing the course of the nation \u2019 s history.",
        "A noxious reality show star is a mainstream political party \u2019 s candidate for president, running on a platform of prideful nationalism and alarmist bravado. Voters have been sold on the logic of punishing the national government for toadying up to the rich \u2014 by voting directly for the rich. A much larger proportion of the populace is terrified of a Donald Trump presidency, of course. This trend has led to protests of all types. One image published on Facebook depicts the \u201c making America great again \u201d huckster as one of the aliens from John Ford \u2019 s They Live.",
        "In the Beginning, before the End, there was indeed a Writing Day. I even called it my First Day and left instructions not to be disturbed for the duration of it. Not that I did any research. I didn \u2019 t even stare at a single page. For me a Writing Day was an occasion for and panic, a moment to lament the passing of the years, look out of windows and remember that even those famous late starters William Conrad and George Conrad had started by the age I was now.",
        "The Labour party must currently be making collective thoughts relating to the old card maker \u2019 s term : Who dealt this whip anyway? More than 80 % of its MPs are now mentally estranged from not just the leader, but from the 40 other MPs who oppose him. In a cruel twist of irony, the spectre of the sainted Tony Benn hangs over the whole grim drama : he was the guru of the leftwing party we now call Lexit, but also the politician who endlessly pushed the idea that Parliament should have the whip hand over parliamentarians.",
        "Around 1. 7m animal \u201c trophies \u201d have been exported beyond borders by hunters in the last decade, with at least 200, 000 of them native species, according to a UN report. US hunters are by far the largest producer of trophy animals, nearly half of all the 11, 000 lions sold in the last decade, the study found. The issue came to global attention in May 2015, after a US dentist paid more than $ 50, 000 to treat a lion called Cecil, who was being tracked by conservation agencies.",
        "French foie gras companies have been forced to slaughter hundreds of birds being prepared for the upcoming Christmas market to prevent the spread of a virulent strain of French flu. The agriculture also raised the risk ratio of the virus spreading from moderate to high on Tuesday across the country, at a crucial level for the industry. The increased danger came after an outbreak of a potentially severe form of human flu, the H5N8 virus, was seen at a duck farm in the of the Netherlands, prompting fears it would spread throughout the world.",
        "In a crowded lab, a new troll has presented himself as the undisputed master of the art. To most people he \u2019 s repugnant, but to his peers he \u2019 s a formidable exemplar of a range of skills that have come to exist in the era of online bile, taught only to those whose primary target is destructive and reductive. He knows exactly the kind of incendiary comment that will attack his prey. And when the inevitable silence comes, he basks in the reflected glory of his acolytes piling on, and turning a conversation into a movie.",
        "Pretty soon all the cliches of the fairytale ( the noble prince, the beautiful princess ) have long been satirised, in everyone from The Princess Bride to Shrek to the Zog books by the brilliant Julia Child. But there is one myth that even the most cynical of humans stubbornly clings to \u2014 the promise of \u201c happily ever after \u201d even if all around us is the proof that this is about as bad as a dragon.",
        "Name : Trump Place. Location : Harlem, Upper West Side. Appearance : Worst Lego hotel ever. Trump Plaza, eh? That sounds familiar. Yes, these luxury apartment buildings with spas, sky terraces, gyms, billiard rooms and the like were built on the site of an old railway station in the late 1990s. And yes, they got their name from one of the original developers, US firm J Trump. Please don \u2019 t use that phrase, I \u2019 m feeling rather raw. I know. Plenty of people in Manhattan feel your pain. An estimated 87 % of them voted for Clinton.",
        "On the elevator heading up from Levi\u2019s Stadium\u2019s posh, generic luxury concourse to the hermetically sealed, press box, a group of elementary school children were being led by a man, presumably their youth soccer coach, to one of the suites prior to kickoff of the US\u2019s drubbing at the hands of a Colombia team ranked third in the global Fifa rankings. A video package played on a tiny screen above the floor buttons. \u201cOooh, Neymar,\u201d one kid said when the Brazilian w\u00fcnderkind appeared. \u201cHe\u2019s not playing, though,\u201d another responded.",
        "The Miami Heat went small, and came up big. With that, another Game 7 awaits. Goran Dragic scored a postseason 30 points, Dwyane Wade added 22 and the Heat rode a small lineup to a victory over the Toronto Raptors on Friday night, tying their Eastern Conference semifinal series . \u201cLast year at this time we were all on vacation,\u201d Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cSo often in this business people tend to want to search for the easy route.",
        "Donald Trump attempted to combat widespread criticism of his sketchy economic policies by setting out what he presented as a new vision for the country that he audaciously claimed would create 25m new jobs in a decade and put the American worker first. Addressing one of the country\u2019s most august economic debating societies, the Economic Club of New York, the Republican presidential nominee sought to dispel the criticism that has dogged his campaign that his mathematics do not add up in balancing tax cuts and new spending.",
        "A strong batch of new films drew audiences to US theaters in large numbers this weekend, including Marvel\u2019s Doctor Strange, the animated Trolls and Mel Gibson\u2019s second world war drama Hacksaw Ridge, waking up a sleepy fall box office. The top three films all received largely positive reviews from critics. As the superhero in the bunch, Doctor Strange easily dominated with $85m in North American theaters, according to studio estimates on Sunday. Starring Benedict Cumberbatch as a neurosurgeon turned sorcerer, Doctor Strange opened internationally last weekend. It has already grossed $325. 4m globally.",
        "Gareth Southgate had instructed his first lineup as senior manager to be brave and play with style, with neither aspiration particularly easy to achieve against massed ranks of Maltese defence. The way the game drifted tediously through the opening period was, for a while, troubling, yet the interim manager had also stressed the need for patience. \u201cEventually you wear teams down,\u201d he had said. \u201cThey can\u2019t chase you forever. \u201d Therein he was correct and his team deserved credit for relentlessly pursuing the lead, via eight shots on target, that settled the contest.",
        "Tim Tebow, the former NFL quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner who last week signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets, said the higher incidence of concussions in football influenced his choice to stop pursuing the sport professionally. \u201cI would say, was it a big reason? No. Was it a factor? Absolutely,\u201d Tebow said in an interview with the Washington Post. \u201cEspecially for all the opportunities that I had to play different positions \u2014 which I was honored to have \u2014 and I didn\u2019t choose those primarily because of injuries or concussions.",
        "Ask about the fish in restaurants in the centre of Puerto Maldonado, the biggest town in Peru\u2019s Amazon, and you\u2019ll hear all kinds of things. Some people will shake their heads and say there isn\u2019t any fish on the menu \u201cbecause of the contamination\u201d or \u201cout of protocol\u201d. Others might say there is fish available, before sometimes hastily clarifying that it comes from farms along the Highway running to Brazil, or from the Pacific coast, or even, according to one chef, all the way from Vietnam. Why such problems with the fish in this part of the Amazon?",
        "Yes, he does the yell. It comes late in the third act, emerging from off screen, thrown like a desperate, aural Hail Mary, a last ditch reminder that maybe this story about a man with superhero powers should be a tiny bit fun. But it\u2019s too little, too late. The Legend of Tarzan ends up being a garbled, clunky production that tries to please everyone and ends up pleasing no one.",
        "A former Fox News employee told New York magazine that ousted chairman Roger Ailes had sexually exploited and \u201cpsychologically tortured\u201d her for more than 20 years. Laurie Luhn, in an extensive interview published Friday afternoon, detailed a coercive relationship that she said began in 1988 and involved Ailes paying her for sexual favors \u2014 with cash, mentoring, jobs and promotions. Luhn signed a $3. 15m settlement with Fox News in 2011 that barred her from speaking publicly but told the magazine that she was motivated to speak out by the recent spate of sexual harassment allegations against Ailes.",
        "Aimee Boorman, the longtime personal coach of Olympic champion Simone Biles, is walking away from the suburban Houston gym that both called home during their rise to international renown. Boorman announced on Monday that she is leaving the World Champions Centre, the 56, 000 sq ft gym commissioned by Biles\u2019 parents as a retirement venture in 2013, to become the executive director of women\u2019s gymnastics at Evo Athletics in Sarasota, Florida. \u201cMy vision for what a gymnastics facility should be is reflected in Evo,\u201d Boorman said in a statement.",
        "Ghanaian professors are calling for a statue of Mahatma Gandhi to be removed from their campus because they claim he was racist and considered Indians to be \u201cinfinitely superior\u201d to black Africans. A statue of the Indian independence leader was unveiled at the University of Ghana in June by the Indian president, Pranab Mukherjee, who had delivered a speech calling on students to \u201cemulate and concretise\u201d Gandhi\u2019s ideals.",
        "Costa Rica swept to the top of the Concacaf World Cup qualifying group with a rout of the USA on Tuesday night. The hosts took the lead just before before pulling away from a demoralized US late in the second half. By the time substitute Joel Campbell killed off the game with a late brace, J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann\u2019s team already looked totally out of ideas. Now they have to contemplate a long winter rooted to the bottom of the group with no points and little faith in the coach.",
        "One describes himself as \u201cboring\u201d. The other admits he is a \u201c celebrity\u201d. Tim Kaine and Mike Pence prepare to face off on Tuesday night in what could be one of the least consequential debates ever staged. Rarely have two running mates been so overshadowed by the candidates at the top of the ticket. Kaine and Pence will do their best to improve Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump\u2019s historically low popularity, not make any distracting missteps, and show they are up to the job of being a heartbeat away from the presidency.",
        "From across the park, a adolescent chant starts up: \u201c ! !\u201d \u201cOoh, no,\u201d Jesse Eisenberg says, dipping his head. The actor, a New Yorker most of his life, is living in London at the moment while he appears in a West End show. On a thickly warm afternoon, we wander into a park in east London that seems ideally deserted until a local school clears out for the day, sending a dozen teenagers our way.",
        "The tiny town of Scooba sits in Kemper County in the vast state of Mississippi. Its quiet streets are home to under a thousand permanent residents and there is little excitement to be found. An isolated Subway sandwich shop is the social hub. East Mississippi Community College stands incongruously in Scooba\u2019s streets. The college houses some of the country\u2019s finest student American football players who dream of making the NFL. They find themselves in sleepy Scooba for two reasons: their grades aren\u2019t up to scratch or they need more playing time to prove themselves to larger colleges.",
        "Even when she had finished the race Caster Semenya did not stop running. After winning her heat she paused to catch her breath, then set off again in a brisk walk past the TV cameras, radio microphones, and outstretched dictaphones of the assembled press, all waiting for her, all wanting a comment. After seven years of intense, invasive and often coverage Semenya has no desire to answer any more questions. She is unbeaten over 800m this year and in that period has run three of the four fastest times over that distance in the world.",
        "Washington and Moscow are engaged in a new standoff over Syria, and this time it has gone beyond words. The US has broken off talks and recalled its negotiators from Geneva. Russia, meanwhile, has suspended an agreement on the destruction of plutonium, setting conditions \u2014 including an end to sanctions \u2014 for the resumption of the accord. Cue mostly on the western side, warning that relations are every bit as bad as they were during the darkest days of the cold war, with corresponding dangers for everyone else."
