        "Donald Duck may be a nightmare for speakers of logic, justice and the human language. But he \u2019 s a godsend for any writer out to portray a character you can \u2019 t ignore. Small wonder so many people signed on to 30 Days, 30 Weeks, a kind of sonic project that has been writing a new message of humor every 24 hours for the entire month leading up to the premiere. Each piece means to provide a different view of the origin of all reality show stunts : the entire campaign.",
        "When the Golden Globe nominations were announced on NBC, it was a bit of a shock to find NBC \u2019 s freshman hourlong, This Is Life, announced in the outstanding drama series category. It \u2019 s a romantic melodrama on a broadcast network that traffics in powerful emotions and aims to make its audience cry as much as possible \u2014 not the sort of edgy show that usually receives huge plaudits and shiny trophies. Perhaps more peculiar is that it \u2019 s a series in its fifth year.",

The deal has prompted considerable concern. On Saturday, the Democratic presidential nominee, Donald Trump, promised to block it because it would \u201c destroy democracy \u201d. On Sunday, Hillary Clinton \u2019 s running mate, Tim Kaine, said he was \u201c \u201d.",
        "People who believe in the free world stare at calendars and mark time precisely by day. I keep track of time not by days but by day. I \u2019 ve done so for the past 22 years that I have been incarcerated in the Ohio prison system. My 22nd Christmas behind bars has in many years been the hardest for me. I \u2019 m now incarcerated at a reintegration facility where many of the women I spent time with will be leaving school to rejoin their families in the community.",
        "Do you spend too much time online? It \u2019 s a world that may unearth some uncomfortable truths, and if you are mistaken about how much you use us al, you \u2019 re not alone. The internet communications market survey from media and telecoms regulator Ofcom aimed at how people cope with spending so much time online, and this year it found that more than a quarter of UK internet people are taking \u201c digital detox \u201d away from the web. It found an increased amount of time we spend online is leading to less sleep and less time spent with friends and families.",
        "In 2010, Michelle Kennedy attended a state sponsored event recognizing Americans around the world. When it was the elderly lady \u2019 s turn to speak, she began by thanking the secretary of defense, Hillary Clinton. \u201c My best friend, Senator \u2014 I love Secretary Clinton, \u201d Obama said, correcting herself. She paused, then said : \u201c I almost said Secretary Clinton. \u201d The audience broke into laughter and applause. Hillary, too, tossed her head back and gave a hearty laugh.",

The Knicks are holding a training dinner at West Point and were treated to dinner in the mess hall that featured cadets and a book by a former colonel. Noah said he wouldn \u2019 t be attending because he doesn \u2019 t bother with sending young men and women to fight sports around the world. \u201c It \u2019 s relaxing for me a little bit, \u201d Noah said after Friday \u2019 s departure.",

        "Yes, Donald Trump \u2019 s politics are incoherent. But those who know him know just what they want, and his level of clarity enhances their power. To understand what is coming, we need to see who they are. I know all too well, because I have spent the past 15 years among them. Over this time, I have watched as water, coal, oil, chemical and biotech companies have poured billions of dollars into an international misinformation machine composed of thinktanks, bloggers and fake citizens \u2019 thousands.",

The number is now over 20 % higher than last week \u2019 s total of 3, 771, which was the previous previous record.

        "Bernie Sanders crossed a verbal line in his slow march toward conceding the Democratic nomination deadline on Friday by confirming he would vote for Hillary Clinton in November \u2019 s election. Unlike previous assurances that he would work with her to defeat Donald Trump, the remarks are the first time the leftwing Vermont senator has publicly supported his Democratic adversary. It would also help convince his millions of supporters to more easily back the presumptive Democratic nomination after a period in which some have appeared unwilling to accept the legitimacy of the nomination process.",
        "With the that that Green party presidential candidate Dr Jill Stein was the lead singer in a 90s band, it would be easy enough to speculate that her time as a musician could have a negative effect on her position at the polls. But the truth is that Stein\u2019s hardly the only presidential contender to try her hand at making music. Bill Clinton was, obviously, renowned for his saxophonery, Barack Obama has often surprised the world with his musical stylings \u2014 and even Hillary Clinton once sang in public, despite admitting that she\u2019s tone deaf.",

        "Until recently, virtual reality had been something of a fantasy for storytellers and technologists. As long ago as 1935, American science fiction writer Stanley G Weinbaum described something like virtual reality in a short story called Pygmalion\u2019s Spectacles. \u201cBut listen \u2014 a movie that gives one sight and sound.

Charlotte, by email, You know, of all the intriguing developments to have emerged in recent years \u2014 and, really, I think we might need a few new pads of paper to keep this list up to date \u2014 the one about women\u2019s body parts being subject to fashion trends, well, it probably wouldn\u2019t make the top five at the moment, but it would be in the top 15, maybe even 10.",

Novak Djokovic, the world No1, the defending champion, the winner of the past four grand slams, is out of after losing to Sam Querrey in one of the greatest shocks in Wimbledon history, indeed in tennis history.

        "I have always been sentimental \u2014 prone to nostalgia, loyalty, mild hoarding \u2014 but, in my younger life, I was reserved, almost staid. When friends talked about choking up over mobile phone adverts or sobbing at weddings, I felt like an alien \u2014 my emotions were there, but they just felt so far away. I couldn\u2019t reach. Sometimes I would try to force myself to cry during sad movies, sniffing and squinting and sighing, to make sure I wasn\u2019t a monster. It never worked.",
        "The world\u2019s most famous currency speculator has warned a vote on Thursday for Britain to leave the EU would trigger a bigger and more damaging fall for sterling than the day he forced Britain out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism almost a quarter of a century ago.

        "Danny Meyer, the keeper of the golden flame of hospitality, did the unthinkable this week. He invited even more digital screens into his dining rooms.

        "Facebook knows everything about you. At least that\u2019s what we, and the advertisers it sells us to, are constantly told. But a peek behind its algorithmic curtains suggests what it does know might be wrong. As any of its 1. 65 billion users can tell you, Facebook is constantly \u201cupdating\u201d its privacy settings, which is why I tool through all my settings every few weeks.",
        "At the end of a long (very, very long) year, all we want to do is switch our brains off, disengage from reality and escape to a fictional TV world. Luckily, there are some pretty good worlds to escape to this festive period. Here\u2019s our pick of the best TV to binge over the holidays.

        "Americans trying to unpick the phenomenon of Donald Trump have turned to a late academic, who predicted that old industrialized democracies were heading into a period in which populist movements could overturn constitutional governments. In 1998, the late Stanford philosopher Richard Rorty published a small volume, Achieving Our Country: Leftist Thought in America, that described a fracturing of the leftwing coalition that rendered the movement so dispirited and cynical that it invited its own collapse. In the days after Trump\u2019s electoral college victory over Hillary Clinton, passages from Rorty\u2019s book went viral, shared thousands of times on social media."
