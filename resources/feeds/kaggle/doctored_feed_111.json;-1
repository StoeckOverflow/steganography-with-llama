        "Walt Disney \u2019 s Adventures began with a closing statement. \u201c These films, \u201d it happens, \u201c are photographed in their natural form and are completely authentic, unstaged and unrehearsed. \u201d This film was there at the start of Seal Films in 1948, and the following 27 minutes of original footage all but invented the classic documentary. Despite the release of Bambi in 1942, Disney had struggled to convince RKO, his distributor, that anyone could pay to watch footage of animals in the wild. But after Monkey Island won an Oscar and became a hit, the struggle was to fill demand.",
        "A statue of Mahatma Gandhi will be removed from a university campus in Ghana after professors signed a petition claiming the early Indian independence poet and thinker was racist. The statue of Gandhi was unveiled in June at the University of Ghana campus in Accra by Pranab Mukherjee, the President of India, as a symbol of cultural ties between the two countries. But in September a group of scholars started a petition calling for the removal of the statue, stating Gandhi was racist and that the government should put African heroes and heroines \u201c first and foremost \u201d.",
        "Former NBC executive Martin Shkreli, a lightning rod for outrage over soaring American prescription drug charges, pleaded not guilty on Friday to an additional criminal charges that federal prosecutors filed against him last week. Shkreli, 33, was charged in December on seven different counts, including securities fraud. Prosecutors on Friday released an eighth charge, saying Shkreli tried to conceal from investigators his control over shares in Retrophin Corp.

        "A man once described the Fake Beard Bandit as a suspect in a string of bank robberies and due to be released in three weeks has been arrested in connection with a bloody crossbow wound that left three men dead in a Toronto cemetery. Wearing white coveralls and fumbling with his fingers, Paul Ryan, 35, of Toronto, was charged with three counts of robbery during a brief court action. He was remanded in custody until 2 September. Details of the murder, including the names of the witnesses, cannot be reported subject to a publication ban.",
        "Americans acquire tattoos. Nearly a million of them have gotten inked, compared with 12 % in Canada. The personal expression that is particularly deep is particularly prevalent with young people : 40 % of American teenagers sport tattoos. Women are also more likely than men to get tattoos. Yet very little is known about the effects of modern American tattoo ink on the human body. The lack of evidence and data is worrisome because some of the key features are known to make people sick or die. It often makes it difficult to identify them.",
        "Baton Rouge staggered into a new state of violence as a black separatist attacked three police officers, including a black girl who recently pleaded with police online : \u201c Don \u2019 t let anything infect your heart. \u201d The blow struck in Louisiana, but it stunned a group already reeling from conflict between police and citizens, calling for both action and protest. By Monday, new details started to appear about both the shooter, Gavin Smith of Missouri, and his victims.",
        "Until very recently, modern wisdom held that breakfast was the most important meal of the world. We \u2019 ve anecdotally tied all sorts of ills to a banquet to sit down to a \u201c complete dinner. \u201d But health research has demonstrated that skipping that fried egg or bed of cereal does not, in fact, contribute to weight gain, fat issues or underperformance. Our reverence for breakfast is still relatively recent. Before the late 19th century in the US, coffee didn \u2019 t have any particular importance ascribed to it.",
        "\u201c The Year of the Games, \u201d the headlines proclaimed throughout the 2012 Olympics. Globally, participation was up to 44. 3 % of the male athletes at the Games, and many countries that had previously balked at becoming women finally did so. For the men, women were a slim fraction of the team \u2019 s participants \u2014 there were 269 male athletes compared to 261 men. But, strikingly, they were a stronger majority of the medalists and the breakout players. US women \u2019 s athletes won gold in basketball, rowing, gymnastics, the rowing eights, and water polo.",
        "Microsoft, the leading conservative company for providing office software using Windows, has taken the difficult step of entering the burgeoning field of marijuana. The company, backed by Bill Gates, announced a partnership on Thursday with Citizens Financial, a Los Angeles firm that sells payment systems to governments that track legalized marijuana sales. Microsoft, which is headquartered in Washington, a country where recreational cannabis is now found, is licensing Kind to sell Microsoft cloud software to authorities to monitor traffic \u2014 rather than becoming fully involved in the trade itself.",
        "A Russian high priest and explorer who holds a world record for the shortest circumnavigation of the globe in a hot air balloon, says he never ate and didn \u2019 t sleep during the ascent, keeping himself awake with a blanket. Fedor Konyukhov, whose voyage took the record when he touched down at the beginning of July near the island where he had set off close to Melbourne, Australia, managed the feat in 11 days and six hours. The previous record \u2014 set by American Steve Fossett in 2002 \u2014 was 13 days and 8 hours.",
        "A location model overlaying the city, with players able to hunt monsters, establish stations, battle each other, build guilds. A virtual imagined town connected to the physical reality by a database of locations and map \u201c \u201d. It \u2019 s not Pok\u00e9mon Go. It \u2019 s Chromaroma, from the mobile games company Mudlark. And it \u2019 s not from this planet. It was released in 2010. Augmented reality games have been in development for the last 15 months, and I ran Mudlark from 2005 to 2011.",
        "In Siberia, melting permafrost released anthrax that had been frozen in a reindeer carcass for months, starting a deadly fire. In Baghdad, soaring temperatures forced the government to shut down for weeks at a time. In Kuwait, thermometers showed a record 54C ( 129F ). July was the hottest month the world has endured since records began in 1880, many have said, and brought a fresh taste of the troubles people around the world may have to grapple with as global warming intensifies. Data compiled by Nasa showed the temperature was 0. 84C hotter than the average for July, and 0.",
        "It should be pointed out that British bookmakers are not always so powerfully prescient as, say, the Pythian priestesses of the temple of Apollo, or even the mercurially gifted Sybill Trelawney from the Harry Potter books. But the announcement by one (actually Irish) site, Paddy Power, that it sees Suicide Squad\u2019s Margot Robbie as the clear favourite to play a Bond girl in the next 007 movie has nevertheless caused a bit of a stir in the spy\u2019s homeland.",
        "Vladimir Putin has denied that Russia has interfered in the US election, claiming that those who believed Moscow could influence the vote were implying the US was a \u201cbanana republic\u201d. Putin dismissed claims of Russian meddling as \u201chysteria\u201d and lectured the US on democracy. He also denied that Donald Trump was the Kremlin\u2019s favoured candidate, though he praised the tycoon\u2019s controversial campaign. In a speech to an annual gathering of Russian and foreign politicians and analysts in Sochi on Thursday, Putin attacked the US over its foreign policy in recent years.",
        "Riz Ahmed runs in from the rain. \u201cI\u2019m doing lots of running around at the moment,\u201d he says, at his home in London. Today he has been filming Rogue One: A Star Wars Story at Pinewood Studios, fighting the Empire as volatile Rebel pilot Bodhi Rook. \u201cYou walk in and get kitted out, it\u2019s like, you\u2019re there,\u201d he enthuses. \u201cThey really build the world. \u201d Last night, he was at the Leicester Square do for Jason Bourne, in which he stars as a morally murky tech entrepreneur. Then he\u2019s off to Vegas for its US premiere.",
        "It is often easy to dismiss viral charity campaigns as \u201cslacktivism\u201d which lacks in impact (we never did catch the warlord Joseph Kony, after all) but a breakthrough discovery bankrolled by 2014\u2019s ALS ice bucket challenge may give the lie to that cynicism. The ice bucket challenge was a phenomenon in the summer of 2014 in which people dunked a bucket of iced water over their heads in order to solicit donations before nominating others to do the same.",
        "Amy Schumer has teamed up with Goldie Hawn for a comedy called Snatched. The first trailer for the movie shows the controversial comedian heading on vacation with the star of Private Benjamin after her boyfriend dumps her. But the two become involved in a nefarious kidnapping plot. It\u2019s from director Jonathan Levine, who was behind Seth Rogen\u2019s Christmas comedy The Night Before, and scripted by Katie Dippold, whose work includes The Heat and Ghostbusters. Paul Feig, who directed both of those films, is also on board as producer.",
        "An unmanned Russian cargo spaceship has broken up in the atmosphere and crashed over Siberia en route to the International Space Station, according to Russia\u2019s space agency. Roscosmos said on Thursday that the Progress cargo craft broke up at an altitude of 118 miles (190km) above the remote Russian Tuva region in Siberia, which borders Mongolia. Most of the debris burned up as it entered the atmosphere before crashing over what the space agency said was an uninhabited area.",
        "Google has launched two smartphones, the Pixel and Pixel XL, in a bid to take on Apple and its iPhone 7 head on. The two Android smartphones are the first to carry Google\u2019s branding without being associated with another manufacturer and are a clear mark in the sand by the : the fight with Apple is now on for the top premium smartphone.",
        "Barbra Streisand, an ardent Hillary Clinton supporter, has gone all in to attack Clinton\u2019s Republican rival Donald Trump in a blogpost she penned for the Huffington Post. \u201cTrump says Hillary doesn\u2019t look presidential?\u201d Streisand writes. \u201cWhat does that mean . .. coming from a guy who looks like a raccoon in a tanning bed . .. with a flying squirrel on his head? That\u2019s what a president is supposed to look like? A wrestler who dies [sic] his hair blonde?\u201d Streisand covers plenty of ground in her impassioned plea to voters.",
        "China\u2019s leaders have been accused of delivering a calculated diplomatic snub to Barack Obama after the US president was not provided with a staircase to leave his plane during his chaotic arrival in Hangzhou before the start of the G20. Chinese authorities have rolled out the red carpet for leaders including India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, the South Korean president, Park Brazil\u2019s president, Michel Temer, and the British prime minister, Theresa May, who touched down on Sunday morning.",
        "Summer is a time when natural light can lend an otherness to almost any subject. From Ryan McGinley\u2019s playful homage to Renaissance nudes, to Nadav Kander\u2019s eerie inlet at Mont these shots by contemporary photographers are testament to that. As the holiday snaps that flood Instagram show, the light can also enhance even the most cliched chronicle of a summer vacation. We take a different kind of photograph in the sun, sensing that it makes us look better because it makes us feel better.",
        "The government has abandoned plans to force businesses to reveal how many foreign staff they employ, following widespread condemnation and accusations that the policy was akin to tattooing workers \u201cwith numbers on their forearms\u201d. Justine Greening, the education secretary, announced on Sunday that companies will not be made to publish the data as suggested by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, during the Conservative party conference. She said the information would be confidential and instead used by the government to identify skills shortages, rather than to \u201cname and shame\u201d businesses that rely on foreign employees.",
        "It\u2019s a freezing cold October night in Cleveland, but the crowd are on fire for Game 7 of the World Series against the Cubs. No stone is left unturned as Chicagoans pray for their first title in over a century: Steve Bartman is locked in a closet, billy goats are swept off the streets. None of it helps morale: Cubs fans know their collapsing club are playing in a cauldron of a city, one on the brink of another major league title after 52 years without a parade.",
        "Roman citizens have been willing to give their mayor, Virginia Raggi, the benefit of the doubt throughout her short and rocky tenure, fully aware that hers is probably one of the toughest jobs in Italy. But even patient Romans could not contain their ire following the unveiling of the city\u2019s official Christmas tree, a fir in the centre of Piazza Venezia that was dubbed the \u201causterity tree\u201d for its minimalist decor. Lacking even a star on top, let alone a shiny bauble or two, the pitiful spectacle drove Romans to express their disappointment on social media.",
        "There never really was a dream to come to America. I had visited twice before \u2014 and both trips had confirmed an immense culture gap. The first time, which involved staying with a blonde east coaster when I was 19, I was so unhappy, I actually developed a rash at the end of my stay. I joked I was clearly allergic to the country, and dyed my hair black upon my return. But by the time I was 24, I was back on a plane, crossing the Atlantic.",
        "If there is any significant lesson to take away from the FBI\u2019s investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of private email servers to conduct official \u2014 and sometimes classified \u2014 business, it is this: even if her actions were \u201cextremely careless\u201d as director James Comey put it on Tuesday, they is also seem to be shockingly commonplace. A May report from the Office of the Inspector General found that both Clinton and her predecessor as secretary of state, Colin Powell, made extensive use of email systems during their tenures.",
        "Astounding. That\u2019s not the only adjective to describe the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 Game 7 victory and first NBA championship in franchise history. Remarkable or sublime would work too. No team has ever come back from down to win the NBA finals, until now. A series defined by back and forth body blows (both figurative and literal) ended in similar fashion \u2014 two teams trading runs and pushing each other to the limit. The moment LeBron James returned to Ohio for has finally arrived. He got one for the Land. \u201cI\u2019m happy to be a part of history,\u201d James said.",
        "The last time Tracey Emin opened an exhibition of her work \u2014 in Hong Kong in March \u2014 she caused international headlines by announcing that she had married a stone in the garden of her house in the south of France. The artist\u2019s latest exhibition, at Lehmann Maupin in New York, continues the theme.",
        "Donald Trump has not yet been elected president, so my plans to leave the planet are still on hold. I might have to leave soon anyway, but I would rather not have to book my seat on the rocket just because some baroque narcissist in the Oval Office had declared atomic war on North Korea, or South Dakota, or whatever target took his fancy when the hottest patootie in the West Wing typing pool swerved away from the outstretched plea of his tiny hands."
