        "For much of modern history, life was also described by Thomas Hobbes as \u201c long, brutish and short \u201d. However, great scientific, economic and cultural progress over the centuries has increased living standards and life expectancy. While these benefits have not been spread widely across countries, or even within countries, in contrast, life is now less rich, less brutish and certainly relatively short. The challenge now is to understand that this progress continues in the spirit of growing longevity.",

The 10th minute managerial appointment of Roman Abramovich \u2019 s successor ended this ferocious derby leaping in delight on the touchline, the fans then planted himself in the front row of defenders in the east stand, as this chaos erupted all around to see the winner. After all last year \u2019 s traumas, the locals will ignore the immense controversy which accompanied success. One game in and round Conte is adored.",

During Wednesday night \u2019 s preseason game against Green Bay, the 49ers player did what many black players have been waiting for more of our black college players to do for a long time \u2014 he protested.

        "Broken glass crunched under shoes, alerting tunnel dwellers that outsiders had arrived. Deeper in the dark, space, 25ft below the Las Vegas strip, Kregg Nattrour rested on a pile of gutted mattress foam. \u201cI wanted to make this my last month down here,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t handle another month of this. \u201d Matt O\u2019Brien, a homeless advocate and writer who visits the tunnels twice a month, said Nattrour looked skinny apparently casino trips prevented the from eating well. \u201cI gambled all my money!\u201d he complained.",
        "years later, one might suppose that the famous dress came on to the stage of its own accord, as if it had life as well as destiny. But yes, in 1962, there was a warm body inside it. This was 19 May 1962, and Marilyn Monroe was bringing happy birthday wishes to the president of the United States.

This is my first election and yet, I won\u2019t be joining the millions of other Americans going to the polls. How could I squander such privilege, particularly when so many Muslim women in the world never get to vote? Voting my conscience \u2014 by abstaining is a painful decision. Friends are astonished by my dilemma. Yet Clinton, for some Muslims, remains a problematic choice, and one I am not able to embrace.",

Sure, the figures are terrible \u2014 violent crimes against women in England and Wales reached record levels last year \u2014 but they\u2019ve been going up for ages.

        "For the thousands hoping to echo the civil rights and rallies at Lincoln Memorial by joining the women\u2019s march on Washington the day after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration: time to readjust your expectations. The Women\u2019s March won\u2019t be held at the Lincoln Memorial.

        "Britain found itself in a subservient, as much as a special, relationship with the US over the invasion and occupation of Iraq from 2003 and was rarely able to overturn sometimes American the lead British administrator in Iraq in 2004 has claimed.
