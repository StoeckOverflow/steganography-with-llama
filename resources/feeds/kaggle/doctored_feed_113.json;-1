        "The United States has imposed sanctions on five senior officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo in an express warning to President Joe Kabila to respect the constitution of the countries, unstable African Community and call elections early this year. The DRC has suffered multiple bouts of unrest since Kabila, 45, announced that the polls would be delayed. Last March about 50 people died in battles between security forces and journalists angered by what opposition critics charge is Kabila \u2019 s plan to retain power unlawfully through the indefinite postponement of a vote.",
        "Kurdish troops backed by foreign ground forces including a military contingent advanced on a town near Mosul on Sunday, rising to within five miles ( nine kilometres ) of the main Iraqi city as Islamic State launched another diversionary attack on the western village of Rutba. Sunday \u2019 s offensive concentrated on encircling the strategic town of Bashiqa, renowned for both its religious diversity and possession of the aniseed liquor arak, until Isis took over in July 2014.",
        "No one saw it coming. But on a Sunday, word came that the US Army Corps of Engineers was getting permission to build the Lake Access pipeline under the Ottawa river, just above the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. What do you do with a war? Many on social grounds cautioned that this was not the victory and we should not celebrate. If we wished for that kind of victory, we \u2019 d rather celebrate. But the people most certainly seemed to realize that this is not even the end of the road, but a really great milestone.",
        "Earlier tonight I set you ten questions from the UK Mathematics Institute \u2019 s Junior Maths Challenge, which was run by 300, 000 year olds the week before last. Here are the questions, responses and explanations. I have also examined the percentage of children who got it right and the percentage of young readers who did. In one instance children did better than average readers ( although this was the difference with the image that stretched ) and in many others the scores were good. Well done all round, anyway.",
        "The American Indian tradition of clearing out of vegetation for the beach every night is at odds with an equally popular tradition of avoiding inconvenience. But for some people the beach always works. Six hours on the road with small children in the water? No problem. A tailback? Just part of the joke. A journey out of Penn Beach to East Hampton, on a road so crowded you have to stand the back way? Deal with it.",
        "What if Stephen Hawking would go anywhere and find anything? Where would he go, and what would he say about it? That \u2019 s the end of Stephen Hawking \u2019 s Favorite Things, which I produced. In just 25 minutes, we sit as Stephen talks about the creation of the cosmos, alien life, his own creation and our place in the universe. I mean it \u2019 s both profound and easy to explain. Meeting Stephen for the first time, years apart, was a bit overwhelming.",
        "Donald Trump scored an early public relations win this season as he took the credit for persuading a local firm not to outsource jobs to employees. But the case \u2014 and its implications \u2014 are more controversial than they first appeared. In February, United Technologies, parent company of Carrier Engineering, a furnace and air conditioner supplier, announced the closure of a factory in Indianapolis with the loss of 1, 400 jobs, along with a factory in the south Indiana city of Gary with a further 700 casualties.",
        "An unarmed officer in southern Virginia did not shoot at a police officer before being fatally shot, a witness testified on air, contradicting the officer \u2019 s explanation for why he would fire. William Jones was shot dead by Constable Stephen Rankin from about five inches after taking a stance and stating mockingly : \u201c Are you going to fucking shoot me? \u201d according to Gregory Provo. \u201c He never charged, he just made a statement, \u201d said Provo, a security officer at a Walmart superstore in Portsmouth.",
        "The Golden State Warriors have to be wishing that Draymond Green had been suspended for Game 4. When the Warriors announced on Monday afternoon that Green would be criticized, but not suspended, for his latest hit on the groin of Oklahoma City Thunder center Matt Adams, it meant the team would take the ball at on Tuesday night with a goal to even the Western Conference finals at two wins apiece. Green \u2019 s presence in the game gave the defending champs no clue.",
        "Another crisis. Another set of grieving parents. Confronted with America \u2019 s dramatic rise of gun violence, most governments agree that something must be done. It \u2019 s agreeing on that \u201c something \u201d which can prove elusive. Is there anything that helps to reduce gun crime in a country in which civilian firearm ownership is a fundamental issue? The first step is to see beyond some of the immediate, outraged objections brought forward after each trial. A ban on assault guns might save a certain number of lives, but is going to make a larger recovery.",
        "I didn \u2019 t plan to get pregnant. I was 33. My daughter \u2019 s dad and I were not together. It was, seemingly, not the right situation. Except that it truly was. Having a child \u2014 our child \u2014 with him, in fact that way, has led to a fabulous life, a brilliant situation and more wonderful than I could have ever dreamed. What made it that way was a decision by both of us to imagine a better future.",
        "Romelu Lukaku reminded everyone that form is temporary but class permanent by demolishing Sunderland\u2019s defence courtesy of a . Quite apart from pouring scorn on suggestions about Everton\u2019s possibly losing his domestic scoring touch, the excellence of Lukaku, Yannick Bolasie and Gerard Deulofeu left the Wearsiders with a solitary point from David Moyes\u2019 first four games in charge. Their extraordinary collapse as Ronald Koeman\u2019s team rose to third place does not bode well. Things may have been deceptively even during a opening period but Koeman expected much more. \u201cThere was a big difference later,\u201d he said.",
        "And finally. .... here\u2019s my colleage Jana Kasperkevic on today\u2019s Fed minutes: The US Federal Reserve could rase interest rates as early as June, according to minutes from its April meeting, with Fed members arguing the risks of a slowdown in the global economy have receded. Yet even as the members have become more bullish about US economic resilience, they remained cautious about raising rates. They voted to keep interest rates unchanged for a third time this year at the April meeting.",
        "New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman has opened an inquiry into the conduct of the Donald J Trump Foundation, the personal charity of the Republican presidential nominee, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to the Guardian. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, Schneiderman said Tuesday that he had been \u201clooking into the Trump Foundation to make sure it\u2019s complying with the laws governing charities in New York\u201d. The source said that Schneiderman \u201copened an inquiry on the Trump Foundation based on troubling transactions that have recently come to light.",
        "I didn\u2019t give much thought to Canada for the first 18 years of my life. Many Americans would not see this as a problem \u2014 Americans who think of Canada as \u2018America\u2019s hat\u2019. But when I found myself in a bar with hundreds of Canadian strangers on my first night at university in Montreal (a city where I could legally go to a bar at 18) I realized that this had been a tremendous oversight. \u201cWho\u2019s the prime minister of Canada?\u201d someone asked me, when I confessed my .",
        "Harvard Book Store was founded in 1932 by Mark S. Kramer, a native of Boston. With $300 borrowed from his parents, he opened a small shop selling used and bargain general interest books in Cambridge. Frank Kramer, Mark and Pauline\u2019s son, entered the business in 1962 and directed the company for over 40 years before selling it to local book lovers Jeff Mayersohn and Linda Seamonson. Harvard Book Store has been locally owned and independently run \u2014 and, has spelled \u201cbook store\u201d as two words \u2014 since 1932.",
        "Pack it in, humanity. Love just died. Angelina Jolie has filed for divorce from Brad Pitt. I know. I am pulling on my oversized cardigan, letting its gigantic cuffs cover the tops of my hands, and holding a gigantic cup of herbal tea. Not drinking it. I hate the stuff. Perhaps later I will get in the tub, listen to some Sarah McLachlan and place a glass of red wine on its edge, remembering the \u2019 good times, my eyes brimming.",
        "We\u2019re going to wrap up our live blog politics coverage for the day. Thank you for reading and see you back here in the morning. Billionaire casino mogulDonald Trump Sheldon Adelson has committed roughly $45 million to Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and other Republican candidates, CNN reports. Adelson\u2019s gifts reportedly include $20m to the Senate leadership fund, a super Pac to elect Republican senators, and as much for the Congressional leadership fund. He was reportedly giving $5m to a political organization backing Trump.",
        "When Sharina Smith arrived back home in Sherman Park, Milwaukee, on Wednesday after a decade living out of state, some things had changed irreversibly. Her cousin, Sylville Smith, was dead. Killed by a city police officer last Saturday after he ran from a traffic stop and allegedly pointed a gun. The gas station close to the family\u2019s daily vigils was now a pile of rubble and ash, burned in the riots that followed Smith\u2019s death. But of the many things in the neighbourhood that had remained constant, Smith spoke about one in particular: the crippling poverty.",

        "Donald Trump\u2019s administration will be the most affluent ever. Estimates are imprecise because we don\u2019t even know the \u2019s true net worth, but the wealth of his cabinet picks so far range from $12bn to $35bn. At the very least, this quadruples that of the Obama cabinet. But more than just representing his friends, loyalists and family, the natural alliances among these people, their hallowed predispositions, will impact the policies they form. We know the dangers of this skewed power.",
        "Facebook is escalating its war on \u201cclickbait\u201d headlines by instituting a new system on its newsfeed that will weed out misleading and exaggerated headlines the same way that email spam filters weed out fantastic offers to help Nigerian princes recover their lost fortunes. The tweaks to the algorithm, announced today in a blog post, will posts with headlines that \u201cwithhold information required to understand what the content of the article is and headlines that exaggerate the article to create misleading expectations\u201d.",
        "After one of the most divisive, dark and damaging election campaigns in US political history, Donald Trump will be the 45th president of the United States. His victory sets in motion massive shifts in national and foreign policy, and will no doubt have a huge impact on debates around race, criminal justice, immigration, gender and the environment in the US and beyond. Many people, in America and around the world, are frightened. Trumpism has exposed faultlines of cynicism, racism, misogyny and xenophobia, and awakened long dormant white nationalist groups.",
        "After the incredulity, the despair, and then the cautious return to optimism, the presidential campaign has entered a phase of almost intolerable anxiety. National polls that don\u2019t signify much are instantly interpreted as omens of the apocalypse tiny anecdotes about early voting figures induce panic, or get clung to like depending on the direction in which they point. Until Tuesday, no new information is likely to bring any sense of closure, only more stress, but that doesn\u2019t stop us from seeking it compulsively.",
        "The destruction wrought by Hurricane Matthew has affected 350, 000 Haitians and left the country facing its worst humanitarian crisis since the devastating earthquake six years ago, the UN has said. Ten thousand Haitians are living in shelters, hospitals are under severe strain and water is in short supply, according to Mourad Wahba, the UN secretary general\u2019s deputy special representative for Haiti. A situation report from the UN\u2019s Office for the of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) citing information from the Haitian government\u2019s directorate of civil protection, said 350, 000 men, women and children in Haiti were in need of assistance.",
        "Losing a parent is always difficult, but saying goodbye to your mother or father when you\u2019re still a child brings its own unique kind of heartache. It\u2019s something Prince Harry touched on this week, when he said that he regrets not talking sooner about the loss of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, who died in a car accident when he was 12. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to suffer, as long as you talk about it. It\u2019s not a weakness. Weakness is having a problem and not recognising it and not solving that problem,\u201d Harry said.",
        "Protected by the Centre Court roof and fortified by his tenacity, nothing was going to stop Novak Djokovic from securing his 30th consecutive grand slam victory, a record in the open era. The rain could not touch Djokovic and nor could Adrian Mannarino, who produced some delightful touches without ever coming close to bloodying the world No1\u2019s nose. Mannarino certainly enjoyed himself on his 28th birthday, playing with flair and panache, and he even had the defending champion rattled after dragging the third set into an unlikely .",
        "If the Buffalo Bills general manager Doug Whaley feels good about helping to put his players on the field every week during the NFL season he has a funny way of showing it. In an interview with WGR 550 radio on Tuesday Whaley indicated he believes the widespread concerns over safety in football are justified. \u201cThis is the game of football,\u201d he said. \u201cInjuries are part of it. It\u2019s a violent game that I personally don\u2019t think humans are supposed to play.",
        "An Egyptian general has been killed by militants near his home in North Sinai, the military has said, the second soldier of his rank to be shot dead in as many weeks. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, in which gunmen opened fire on Brig Gen Hesham Mahmoud Abualazm from a moving car in Arish city, North Sinai\u2019s provincial capital. Abualazm, 47, died instantly. He was on a visit to Arish, where he owned a house, and did not serve in Sinai, security sources said. Isis claimed responsibility via its news agency, Amaq.",
        "How do you get everyone to talk about your album? By barely talking about it. Or else by shouting the house down and throwing everything at the wall. There is, seemingly, no third way. Take the concurrent examples of Solange and Bon Iver. Both released their new (and third) albums on the same day. Bon Iver did the usual rounds of press interviews and radio promotion for months in advance, with reviews hailing 22, A Million as a modern masterpiece."
