        "Donald Trump appeared overnight on a wall in the Lithuanian capital this day \u2014 larger than lifesize and locked in a conversation with Russian president Vladimir Putin. The mural was intended as satire, a nod to the deep mutual appreciation between two macho demagogues on opposite sides of the world, and a wink at the long mark of Soviet history that still hangs over the region. Now, with Putin and America \u2019 s commitment to protect the Baltics in question for the first time in decades, it seems to represent something much bigger.",
        "Born in London, Irvine Welsh was working for the council and studying for an MBA at University when he wrote Trainspotting. Released in 1993, the novel was a hit, and in 1996 was made into a film by Danny Glover. A sequel is released every month, and an immersive theatre production of the original book begins at The Vaults, London SE1, until 15 January. Welsh \u2019 s latest novel, The Great Artist, was published this month. He is married for the second time and lives in Chicago. When were you happiest?",
        "Thirteen men were shot and wounded at a hunting party in Bridgeport, Connecticut, on Saturday night, prompting a thorough search for two men. A Bridgeport police spokesman, Av Harris, said investigators believed two shooters opened fire on partygoers from behind some hedges surrounding the house \u2019 s backyard. The shooting happened at about 1. 30am, Harris said. Two men and two women were shot and taken to hospitals. Harris said one woman was shot in the stomach and was in critical condition, and 11 of the other injured were to the lower extremities and.",
        "I was a teenager when I knew the worst of humanity. I remembered our house burning to the ground and my family fleeing Srebrenica, fighting against hope for a chance to escape. I remember the torture, and the taste of blood. I didn \u2019 t know it happened, but I was living through the worst horror in Europe since the first world war. And finally, I remember the promises of \u201c never again \u201d. Those promises are being broken, hour after hour, day after day, in the deepening horror of east Poland.",
        "China has introduced a law that bans film making deemed harmful to the \u201c interests, honour and interests \u201d of the public. It also encourages the support of \u201c socialist core film \u201d. Booming receipts have drawn Hollywood talent and a growing Chinese population into fierce competition for the foreign giant \u2019 s movie rights, which some analysts predict will soon eclipse that of the US. The proposed laws govern the state of the film industry and were introduced by the National People \u2019 s Congress standing committee at a conference in Beijing.",
        "The nephews of Venezuela \u2019 s leading lady believed they were so important that they could dispatch weapons from the \u201c presidential hangar \u201d at Caracas airport, US police have said at the start of a narcotics outbreak in New York. Franqui Francisco Flores de Freitas, 31, and Efrain Jos\u00e9 Campo Flores, 30, are suspected of attempting to send 800 kilos of cocaine from Venezuela to the US. Both are nephews of Cilia Flores, the wife of embattled president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
        "Even here, in a region bursting with natural light, it is hard to imagine a more idyllic setting than Green Beach on P\u00e5gan Land. Azure waters roll freely before disappearing into the volcanic arc on a perfectly shaped horseshoe bend on the horizon, cliffs plunge into wide open water that stretches, unhindered, more than 1, 600 miles to the coast of the world.",
        "Borussia Dortmund defeated Legia Warsaw \u2014 a record for the most goals in a Champions League game \u2014 helped by a Marco Reus. Dortmund scored five goals in 15 minutes with Shinji Kagawa grabbing five goals while Reus, back after five months out injured, started the scoring in stoppage time. They had fell behind early on to an Aleksandar Prijovic penalty but that sparked a remarkable display of seven goals in 15 minutes that gave the home side a interval lead.",
        "Just over a fortnight before the roof closes in on the US, another week prepares itself for another day in its long, checkered and legendary tradition. On this Monday afternoon, the Rolling Stones have taken over the Four Seasons hotel in Dallas in order to talk about their forthcoming album, Blue Lonesome, and to prepare for the night \u2019 s show. It \u2019 s the second of a few American dates including Desert Trip, the rock festival that saw them share a bill completed by Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Roger Waters and the Who ( earning it the name Oldchella ).",
        "\u201c Street Scene is what I always called it because it came from the top off my head and we never rehearsed, \u201d says a spry, Bill Curtis, the longtime and maestro behind The Fatback Boys. \u201c Everything was just raw material. Most of the guys had no idea until it was possible to do it. That \u2019 s how we made all our first albums. \u201d Beginning in the late 60s, Fatback wrote over 40 projects with Curtis, sold at a rate of an album every year.",
        "We are used to dates and number plates being created by Google to protect space for images on Street animals, but animals don \u2019 t often suffer the same fate \u2014 except for this little cow. The picture, which was taken last summer at Coe Abbas, was spotted by the Guardian \u2019 s political opinion editor Ali Shariatmadari. Although the cow can be seen in all its bovine glory in one tree near the river Nile, Google appears to have bought it for a tighter crop. The Google giant admitted its design may have been a little overeager.",
        "Scientists have also hopes for a radical alternative therapy for phobias and stress disorder ( PTSD ) with a procedure that can dampen down fears connected to painful memories. The procedure holds particular benefits for patients because in early months, researchers found they could reduce anxieties triggered by painful memories without allowing people to think about them consciously. That could make it more powerful than exposure therapy, which tries to help patients address their phobias by making them confront their feelings in a safe environment, for example by encouraging them to handle snakes or snakes in the clinic.",
        "Marco Rubio will seek to a second term in the US Senate, he announced on Wednesday, marking a reversal from his repeated vows to become a private citizen after the failure of his presidential campaign in March. \u201cIn politics, admitting you\u2019ve changed your mind is not something most people like to do. But here it goes,\u201d Rubio said in a statement. \u201cI have decided to seek to the United States Senate. \u201d Rubio\u2019s decision, which will shake up one of the most competitive Senate races in the country, caps off weeks of speculation about his political future.",
        "The actor Tom Arnold has claimed to have video of Donald Trump using racist language, obscenities and denigrating his own son in outtakes of The Apprentice. \u201cI have the outtakes to The Apprentice where he says every bad thing ever, every offensive, racist thing ever. It was him sitting in that chair saying the saying the calling his son a retard, just being so mean to his own children,\u201d Arnold told the radio station KIRO.",
        "Donald Trump isn\u2019t the only familiar face in the 2005 taped recording of the Republican nominee bragging about attempting to \u201cfuck\u201d married women. The other man in the frame making lewd comments is former Access Hollywood host Billy Bush, a cousin of former president George W Bush. At various points, the young Bush gamely laughs along at Trump\u2019s gross boastings. When apparently spotting actor Arianne Zucker outside the bus, who is wearing a purple dress, Bush says: \u201cSheesh, your girl\u2019s hot as shit in the purple. Yes, the Donald has scored.",
        "Women and advocacy groups are preparing for the most serious assault on reproductive rights in decades after Hillary Clinton, the first female nominee of a major party, lost the presidential election to Donald Trump. Trump\u2019s election, in tandem with an undivided Congress under Republican control, 33 GOP governors and an open seat on the supreme court with the possibility of more appointments, has cast serious uncertainty about the future of abortion in the US, advocates say. \u201cIt\u2019s really bad \u2014 bad as we\u2019ve ever seen it,\u201d said Donna Crane, the of policy for Naral, a advocacy group.",
        "Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, has been mocked and criticised over his praise of the late Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Following the death of Castro, Trudeau, whose father had a close relationship with the revolutionary, released a statement mourning the loss of a \u201cremarkable leader\u201d. Castro, who died on Friday aged 90, won support for bringing schools and hospitals to the poor but also created legions of enemies for his ruthless suppression of dissent. Trudeau\u2019s comments were markedly more positive than most western leaders, who either condemned Castro\u2019s human rights record or around the subject.",
        "Was it fitting that late 2016 saw us all standing stock still, as if we were trying to convince a suspicious bear we were already dead? Phone cameras prowled around increasingly elaborate and tableaux vivants, looking for signs of life, yet no one stirred as the views racked up. In that sense, this was the additive inverse of 2013\u2019s Harlem Shake. It was an ice bucket challenge where no one needed nominating. A Cheerios challenge where you didn\u2019t have to put cereal on a sleeping baby\u2019s forehead. Or, if you prefer, a challenge that wasn\u2019t quite so tedious.",
        "years ago, crime comics \u2014 packed with lurid depictions of violent criminal activity \u2014 caused a moral panic in the US, with titles such as Crime Does Not Pay! raising fears of an impressionable generation being warped by sex, drugs and rough justice. The crime titles, along with the horror comics published by the likes of EC, were the subject of Dr Frederic Wertham\u2019s infamous takedown Seduction of the Innocent, which led to the comics industry cleaning up \u2014 and sanitising \u2014 its act through the creation of the Comics Code Authority.",
        "World Cup qualifying in North America is set to be overhauled to avoid shutting out the majority of countries in the Concacaf region so early. Concacaf president Victor Montagliani has instigated a review of an \u201carchaic\u201d format that leaves only six out of the region\u2019s 35 teams still in with a shot at qualifying for Russia in 2018. Alongside a potential new name to replace the Concacaf brand, revamping qualifying to be more inclusive has emerged as a key objective for Montagliani after five months in charge of the confederation covering North and Central America and the Caribbean.",
        "Hundreds of churches in the US have said they are willing to provide sanctuary for undocumented migrants threatened with deportation following the election of Donald Trump as president. About 300 churches nationally have come forward in the past two weeks, according to the New Sanctuary Movement. It has also seen the number of people in the city registering as volunteers for its \u201csanctuary in the streets\u201d programme rise from 65 to more than 1, 000 since the election. The Church World Service estimates 400 churches nationwide are willing to open their doors to people at risk of deportation.",
        "Pack away the flags. Put the down. After two strangulated, ultimately hysterical weeks in France it really is time to go home. It was not just England\u2019s tournament that ended at the Stade de Nice with this stunning defeat by Iceland, a nation the size of the London Borough of Lewisham.",
        "Cuba has announced the launch of five days of nationwide military exercises to prepare troops to confront what the government calls \u201ca range of enemy actions\u201d. The government did not link the exercises to Donald Trump\u2019s US presidential victory but the announcement of maneuvers and tactical exercises across the country came nearly simultaneously with Trump\u2019s surprise win. It is the seventh time Cuba has held what it calls the \u201cBastion Strategic Exercise\u201d often in response to points of high tension with the United States.",
        "Turkey\u2019s prime minister, Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, has declared an attempted coup by a military faction to be over, calling it a \u201cblack stain\u201d on the country\u2019s democracy and pledging harsh punishment for those involved. After a night of chaos and bloodshed, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m said the government would consider reintroducing the death penalty, which would allow it to execute those behind the coup, the country\u2019s fifth in 60 years. He said that the authorities had detained nearly 3, 000 military personnel including officers and praised the role played by civilians, the police and the security services in facing down the military.",
        "Typhoon Nida has swept across Southern China with the city of Guangzhou issuing its red storm alert and Hong Kong braced for flooding and landslides. Those living in the storm\u2019s projected path on the mainland were told by the the National Commission for Disaster Reduction to prepare three days\u2019 worth of food and other essentials, the official Xinhua news agency reported. After making landfall near Hong Kong, the typhoon was expected to churn across the manufacturing centre of Guangdong province, gradually weakening as it moved into the neighbouring Guangxi region.",
        "On a fine Saturday morning, the music school in Vicente Guerrero is abuzz with preparations for the debut concert of its chamber orchestra: in one shady corner, a group of fledgling clarinetists are practising breathing exercises in the courtyard, the cello section are rehearsing scales nearby, a flute lesson for five schoolgirls is under way. What makes this idyllic scene so remarkable is Vicente Guerrero\u2019s location on the edge of a vast rubbish dump. The community, in one of Mexico\u2019s poorest states, has a reputation for drug abuse and gang violence.",
        "The far left\u2019s ideology is not \u201cleftwing\u201d in any sense that a socialist from the 19th or 20th centuries would have understood. It is simply opposition to the west whatever the west does. Occidentalism explains the appearances of Labour\u2019s leaders on Iran\u2019s propaganda channels the endorsements of Russian imperialism, and the silence that greets the Syrian massacres. There is no secret about the nihilism and double standards. Both have been obvious to me at any rate since the bulk of the left failed to show solidarity with the victims of Saddam Hussein in the Iraq war of 2003 .",
        "Final thoughts: It looked like a game of two halves was more likely to tilt the USA\u2019s way at the end but credit to Juan Carlos Osorio for constantly keeping his counterpart with his adjustments. His rotations and general wonkiness can make Osorio ripe for satire, but his adjustment to negate the US dictated the key period of the first half, and the introduction of Lozano then switch of flanks relieved any of pressure as the US searched for a winner, while having to be mindful of Mexico\u2019s threat. Not mindful enough.",
        "A giant, flightless bird with a head the size of a horse\u2019s roamed the Arctic 53m years ago when the icy wilderness was more like a swamp, scientists have confirmed. A joint study by American and Chinese institutions found that the massive beast, known as Gastornis, existed on what is now known as Ellesmere island, found above the Arctic circle. It\u2019s estimated the bird was 6ft tall and weighed several hundred pounds. The evidence for Gastornis\u2019s presence in the Arctic comes from a single fossil toe bone, found by researchers in the 1970s.",
        "What drives you? For most people, it\u2019s a desire to be happy. Social norms have taught us to believe that if we work hard to achieve our goals, happiness will come. Yet once we do, instead of staying happy, our brain often changes the parameters of what success looks like. Then it\u2019s time to work toward the next achievement in the hope that it will bring even more happiness."
