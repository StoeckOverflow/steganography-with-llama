        "An Oakland area in which a fire killed at least 24 people had a history of protests and complaints, city sources show. Numerous public complaints were filed about the building, according to city reports, which included a 14 November \u201c housing habitability \u201d charge regarding \u201c illegal interior building control \u201d. The documents did not specify the fire problems at the \u201c Ghost Shop \u201d warehouse, in the Fruitvale neighborhood, but suggested the city \u2019 s investigation into that situation was still pending when the fires broke out late on Halloween.",
        "In a fitting addition to a year in which he dominated TV screens and front page, Donald Trump has been named Time \u2019 s person of the year.

        "If Easyjet happened to need an extra flight or flight out of Turkey each day, Bruce Willis would never have made it to Wimbledon, never have played on Centre courts, never have aced Roger Federer. Willis, the tennis player in the team, squeezed into the tournament only because his mentor and rival Scott Clayton decided to skip the winter grasscourt season. Clayton, 22, flew to Turkey instead to compete in a Futures event at the Belconti Resort Resort in Antalya. He lost in the first round. The had a place waiting in Wilson \u2019 s tournament in Roehampton.",
        "Politicians and journalists are not slow in wondering how to handle losing Donald Trump. Several artists also felt a moment of reckoning. actors and performers poured into the 39th Kennedy Center Honors in Washington on inauguration night seemingly shouting in praise for Barack Obama and regret at his imminent assassination. They were somewhat more unsure and concerned about whether they would return next year if Clinton is in attendance and whether they could accept invitations to perform at his house or at the White House.",
        "Manchester United are through to the Champions League top 16 with a match to spare though Pep Guardiola had to use four separate defensive units to secure the required draw. City also had Fernandinho sent off needlessly after Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach had been restricted to 10 men and the visitors showed a lack of ruthlessness that will concern their fans, particularly as he has previously described it as a weakness.",
        "Comedian Kevin Hart is set to take on the role of Santa Claus in a forthcoming Christmas film developed by Disney. Hart will play the jolly in Dashing Through the Snow, a family adventure about an overworked New York lawyer who takes his son to stay with him on Christmas Eve. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the film will be produced by Will Packer, who has worked with Hart on the successful Ride Wild franchise.",
        "Geena Davis will make a documentary about gender equality in Hollywood. According to Variety, the actor will work on the movie with the Tom Donahue, who also narrated HBO documentary Casting By. \u201c I \u2019 ve been frustrated by my peers speaking out on gender disparity in recent years, but we simply are not seeing the actual demographic change, \u201d Davis said. \u201c There \u2019 s been no real improvement in the number of female roles since 1946, and there \u2019 s still a dearth of female voices.",
        "Decades before Caroline Fleming won the Pulitzer prize for music or collaborated with Kanye West, she was lulled to laughter nightly by her father \u2019 s baffling piano play. \u201c He \u2019 s a doctor and he loves music very much. He also has this incredibly delightful, not deliberate way of getting the metronome on and being completely out of sync with it, and just continuing on, \u201d says Shaw, 33, with a peal of laughter as we polish off pints of milk at a Brooklyn bistro. \u201c It \u2019 s like this little polyrhythm.",
        "Both before and, more so, after the election of Donald Trump as the next US president, debate in the press about the use of the term \u201c \u201d has been heated and forthright. Some regard it as a \u201c helpfully sanitising nomenclature \u2026 for a movement that is characterized by an ideology of ethnic superiority, and encompassing white supremacists and particularly the Ku Klux Klan \u201d. To that end, the political news website ThinkProgress has said not to use the term at all, particularly when quoting other people, because it \u201c won \u2019 t do racists \u2019 public service work for them \u201d.",
        "The UN has been accused of failing to act efficiently enough to save hundreds of thousands of lives in northern Nigeria where a food crisis already killing millions of people a day is said to become the most devastating in Africa. Nigerian authorities, who hold tight control over communications and media access to the crisis, have also been accused of financial negligence and attempting to conceal the origin of the crisis. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) has categorised 4.",
        "The simple forehand volley caromed into the clay court and the champion bounced gently backward into the crowd the coup de gr\u00e2ce as elementary as the three service singles that preceded it. Serena Williams was the Wimbledon champion for a second time with a win over Angelique Kerber \u2014 a 22nd seeded championship all but ending the debate over whether she is the best there has ever been.",
        "By midday, Soni Mishra * has taken off her dupatta ( hood ) wiped the makeup off her wet face, and phoned her husband twice to make sure he can meet their son from school. Mishra, along with at least a dozen other friends, has been queuing for two hours in baking heat at a Dena Bank store in Mumbai, hoping to collect a bundle of cash she has brought with her. For the past 15 years, Mishra, a housewife, has been home for a rainy day. \u201c last month, my husband lent me some money for the household business.",
        "\u2018 Cheers, \u2019 says Mrs Redgrave. She clinks her glass of elderflower press\u00e9 against my coffee. At 79, with those eyes and that great silver flash of hair, she looks as gorgeous as ever. I tell her that my husband loves watching her play Jemma in the TV soap Holby. As compliments go, it \u2019 s not up to much for the woman who was considered by Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams as the greatest star of their time, but she responds gracefully. \u201c pretty, does she? How sweet! I \u2019 ll pass that on. \u201d She could not be more charming.",
        "The United States\u2019 intelligence chief has resigned ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. James Clapper\u2019s turbulent tenure as director of national intelligence was defined by combating whistleblower Edward Snowden\u2019s National Security Agency revelations and defending his own integrity after those disclosures contradicted his statements to Congress. Clapper, who had clashed with Donald Trump\u2019s aide Michael Flynn, told a hearing of the House intelligence committee on Wednesday that he had submitted his resignation on Wednesday night and felt \u201cpretty good\u201d about it.",
        "A legal case against Facebook, which will involve a taking the company to court in Belfast over naked images published on the social network, could open the floodgates for other civil claims, according to lawyers who work with victims of revenge pornography. Facebook\u2019s forthcoming trial, which centres on the claim that it is liable for the publication of a naked picture of the girl posted repeatedly on a \u201cshame page\u201d as an act of revenge, has alarmed the tech world and could have a seismic impact on how social media companies deal with explicit images.",
        "In May, the ad men and artists Douglas Cameron and Tommy Noonan brainstormed ways to protest the rise of Donald Trump. They wanted to build something memorable, something that would stand out in a national landscape that\u2019s saturated with protests. To comment on the growing wealth inequality that they believe will flourish even more should Trump become president, they decided to create the Trump Hut, a small inhabitable structure crafted into the shape of Trump\u2019s hair. \u201cThe inside of the Trump Hut is a total luxury experience,\u201d Noonan says.",
        "Thousands of Fight for 15 supporters chanted, marched, sat in and got arrested in 340 cities across the US on Tuesday, declaring that they won\u2019t back down no matter who is in the White House. Tuesday\u2019s large protest \u2014 the movement\u2019s 12th strike \u2014 was a far cry from four Novembers ago when the Fight for 15 held its first strike. That day, just 200 workers walked out in one city, New York, calling for fairer wages. On Tuesday, 500 workers at Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare airport alone went on strike, led by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).",
        "A court in Istanbul has remanded 17 Turkish journalists in custody as international concern mounts over the government\u2019s targeting of reporters. journalists appeared before a judge in hearings that lasted until midnight on Friday. Four were freed but 17 have been charged with membership of a terror group, the Anadolu news agency said. Arrest warrants were issued this week for 89 journalists, at least 40 of whom have now been detained. The Turkish government has used a state of emergency law to order the closure of at least 131 newspapers, television and radio stations, publishers and news agencies.",
        "A golden goal for a team in gold: thus did Mohamed Diam\u00e9 send Hull City back to the Premier League with a strike worth millions deep into this pulsating final that ended with a deserved winner and the swaths of blue and white from south Yorkshire mulling over what might have been. Sheffield Wednesday came here in numbers and did their club proud but in the end Keiren Westwood\u2019s admirable resistance was not enough.",
        "Freshman Indiana running back Kiante Enis was kicked off the team Thursday, less than 24 hours after being charged with two counts of felony child molestation for allegedly having an improper relationship with a child under 13. The athletic department issued a statement, announcing the dismissal would take effect immediately. The Randolph County Sheriff\u2019s Department said the charges were filed on Wednesday. Each is punishable by up to 16 years in prison and a fine of up to $10, 000.",
        "The largest supermoon in 68 years has risen in Europe and Africa, and astronomers across the world are keenly observing the stunning natural phenomenon. Skygazers took to buildings, observatories and beaches to get a glimpse of the closest supermoon to Earth in almost seven decades, and snap dramatic pictures. The supermoon was first visible in Australia and Asia as night fell in the east. In New York City, the Chrysler building lit up when the supermoon set behind it, and photographers captured the moon rising over the US Capitol dome in Washington DC.",
        "Two people were shot to death Monday at a carnival celebrating Caribbean culture in the hours before the city\u2019s annual West Indian Day parade. Police say Tyreke Borel was shot in the chest around 4am Monday and Tiarah Poyau was shot in the face a short distance away around 4. 15am. No arrests have been made. A woman was also shot in the hand and the arm at the same location and was taken to a hospital in stable condition, police said. Police say they\u2019re investigating whether the shootings are related.",
        "The connection between writing and dancing has been much on my mind recently: it\u2019s a channel I want to keep open. It feels a little neglected \u2014 compared to, say, the relationship between music and prose \u2014 maybe because there is something about it. But for me the two forms are close to each other: I feel dance has something to tell me about what I do. One of the most solid pieces of writing advice I know is in fact intended for dancers \u2014 you can find it in the choreographer Martha Graham\u2019s biography.",
        "Alain Jupp\u00e9, the favourite to win the French presidential election next year, has said Britain needs to leave the European Union as quickly as possible, arguing that a long period of uncertainty would be damaging to the markets and economic growth. On a visit to London on Monday, Jupp\u00e9, who is tipped to win a primary against Nicolas Sarkozy later this year, said procrastination on Brexit would not be permitted. \u201cWhen you get divorced, you do not get to stay at home,\u201d he declared. \u201cYou have to leave the common house\u201d.",
        "I\u2019m very fond of Don\u2019t Think Twice, It\u2019s All Right \u2014 I got into Bobby Bare\u2019s version first (Steve Mackey and I put it on a compilation called The Trip that we put together in 2006). It\u2019s a great song: he\u2019s making light of it, but one or two little digs show that he is actually a bit upset. My favourite verse goes: \u201cI wish there was something you would do or say To try and make me change my mind and stay But we never did too much talking anyway \u2019t think twice, it\u2019s all right.",
        "One of the few positives to take from USA\u2019s loss to Colombia on Friday came 15 minutes after the final whistle. Despite an anemic performance from the US, the American Outlaws, the team\u2019s most famous supporters\u2019 group, remained behind to sing for the team, in the hope of motivating them for Tuesday\u2019s match against Costa Rica. For the Outlaws, these shows of diehard support are nothing new. They sold out their entire allocation for the Copa Am\u00e9rica in two days, and brought the largest group of foreign supporters to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.",
        "Few American corporations are more equipped to investigate an employee than the NFL. The league and their teams spend heavily to scour the past of every prospect coming out of college, hire private eyes to stalk players in nightclubs, and collect mountains of data on everything from sleep cycles to injury risk. If money is involved, they are relentless in what they seek. But when it comes to matters like domestic violence, the world\u2019s most lucrative sports league cowers behind flimsy legal excuses.",
        "A newly published study from the University of Copenhagen has confirmed a link between hormonal contraceptives and depression. The largest of its kind, with one million Danish women between the ages of 15 and 34 tracked for a total of 13 years, it\u2019s the kind of study that women such as me, who have experienced the of birth depression first hand, have been waiting for. Researchers found that women taking the combined oral contraceptive were 23% more likely to be diagnosed with depression and those using pills (also known as \u201cthe \u201d) were 34% more likely.",
        "The police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was charged with manslaughter and released early on Friday morning after posting a $50, 000 bond. Officer Betty Shelby was booked at 1. 11am and was held in custody for 20 minutes before posting bail. Shelby was charged in relation to last week\u2019s killing of Terence Crutcher, who was unarmed. If convicted, she faces between four years and life in prison.",
        "Humans are unlikely to ever blow out more than 125 candles on their birthday cake, according to research that suggests that our lifespan has already hit its natural limit. The oldest human who ever lived, according to official records, was Frenchwoman Jeanne Louise Calment, who died in 1997. Now a team of American researchers suggest Calment is unlikely to lose the top spot any time soon, as their research shows that though more people reach old age each year, the ceiling for human lifespan appears to be stuck at around 115 years."
