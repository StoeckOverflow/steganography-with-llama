        "It \u2019 s not quite as complicated as the battles to save the species of the Amur leopard and giant panda from extinction, but a campaign to preserve a number of endangered regional American words and phrases has been started, looking to save the importance of \u201c wamus \u201d to \u201c sonsy \u201d and \u201c spouty \u201d to \u201c bonnyclabber \u201d.

        "Woolsery in north Gloucestershire has all the features that might be characteristic of the British village : green hedgerows bordering winding roads, tidy bearing regimented rows of bungalows and, in the center of the village, the medieval stables, the empty listed house and the pub. Sonia Jones, of the parish council, arrives at the listed building, known as the Manor House. \u201c The sight of that and the pub was depressing, \u201d she says. On this blustery sunny day, however, there are times of change.",

        "Here \u2019 s Les Love \u2019 s game report : one final bit of preparation for Steph Curry \u2019 s struggles. He \u2019 s been really bad... for someone who was playing good all season. Week 3 mercifully ends as Cleveland wins by 30 points to tighten the deficit. Golden State lost. Kyrie Irving got it back for the Cavs in the 1st quarter and LeBron took it away in the 2nd half. Kevin Love, well... poor Chris Love. Cavs are now at home this year, and have won 7 of those games by. Cleveland is also a sports wonderland!",

        "J\u00fcrgen Klopp : an apology. Like many other news sources, we might previously have got the impression Liverpool \u2019 s player was a charming, successful, tactically minded hunk of competence. Headlines such as \u201c Klopp \u2019 s Dortmund win Bundesliga title \u201d \u201c Klopp leading Liverpool to European success \u201d and \u201c Klopp : pretty much every other club jealous they didn \u2019 t like him \u201d might, in retrospect, have been misleading.",

        "Working at Facebook, even as a contractor, was going to be the opportunity of a lifetime. It was, ultimately, the most toxic work project of my life. As a curator, my responsibility was to choose what links would appear on the Facebook \u201c trending \u201d posted on the right side of a blog \u2019 s newsfeed. Every day, I sifted through hundreds of topics ( or \u201c keywords \u201d ) that Facebook assured me were trending on the platform.

        "The Hungarian government\u2019s map of Europe is dotted with stark warnings of \u201c zones\u201d it claims are patrolled by violent immigrants, six in the UK clustered around London alone. The poisonous graphic, in a leaflet handed out to voters ahead of a controversial referendum on refugees, pays no heed to facts or geography but its message is clear.

Whichever way you cut it, Kirk was a man who cast \u2014 who still casts, aged 99 \u2014 an extremely long shadow.

        "Sadly, the two gooseberry bushes we planted in the small flowerbed at the front of our house haven\u2019t liked their position: one has given up the ghost completely, while the other is sickly and barely hanging on. My parents\u2019 goosegogs, meanwhile, which were inherited from my grandparents, have survived rubble, two lots of builders and many more indignities, yet they still bear fruit year after year after year.
