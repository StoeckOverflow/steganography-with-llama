        "Donald Trump \u2019 s campaign chair in a southeast Ohio county has stated there was \u201c no racism \u201d during the 1960s and said black people who have not succeeded over the generations only have themselves to blame. Kathy Brown, who is white and chair of the Democratic nominee \u2019 s campaign in Mahoning County, made the remarks during a taped interview with the Guardian \u2019 s Anywhere but Washington series of election coverage. \u201c If you \u2019 re black and you haven \u2019 t been successful in the last 50 years, it \u2019 s your own fault. You \u2019 ve had one opportunity, it was given to you, \u201d she stated.",
        "It was billed as the \u201c first wonder of the world \u201d when it landed a ago on the glitziest stretch of the east shore, but after multiple bankruptcies and the final union strike in Panama City casino history, the Trump Taj Mahal is about to go the ways of the Colossus of Rhodes.",
        "On the campaign line, Donald Trump said that he would be an agent of power. He was going to \u201c drain the economy \u201d booting from power the entitled elites who became rich while ordinary folks struggled. So, just how is that working out? Not very good. By the look of his appointments so far, voters who were hoping the \u2019 s cabinet would be handpicked to make the country a better place for elite Americans is likely to be sorely missed.",
        "Rupert Murdoch is likely to lose almost all of the $ 100m he invested in Theranos, the blood bank startup beset by scandals exposed by the Wall Street Journal, his flagship daily newspaper. Murdoch is rumored to have invested $ 100m in Theranos between 2014 and 2015, when its valuation was soaring thanks to the success of being able to revolutionize blood technology by replacing needles with metal pricks.",
        "The writing is on the case for Jacob Zuma, South Africa \u2019 s embattled president, but will he heed it? Rumblings of discontent over alleged fraud, and economic mismanagement have been growing in vehemence and hostility all year. They have now reached fever pitch amid impassioned cries for Zuma \u2019 s immediate resignation. The intensifying furore since Wednesday \u2019 s publication of a report by a respected independent watchdog brings an urgent judicial inquiry into possible graft involving the president and his son. Zuma \u2019 s position remains precarious. The president \u2019 s term, his second, runs until 2019.",
        "The Pew Research Center recently published its 2016 review of the News Media Channel, which shows that while podcasts are growing, technology companies are still struggling to come up with creative tools to make money. To that point, Gimlet Creative is now open for collaboration. The sponsored content arm of the company behind programs like Reply All, Start Up, and Today Show ( please get back soon, Big Show! ) has teamed up with eBay for their first outing. The series is called Money for Business and focuses on themes of entrepreneurship.",
        "From Tuesday, the Los Angeles County College of Art will screen Sculpt, a $ 1. 5m documentary film by the French filmmaker Loris Gr\u00e9aud. It will be shown at Lacma \u2019 s Bing Auditorium, an auditorium that normally seats 600 people, but with an almighty caveat : Gr\u00e9aud has requested that all of the objects be removed except for Lisa, which will sit in the centre of the stage, forlorn and exposed. The film, which is about four hours long, will be viewed between four and six times a day. Viewers will be invited to watch it alone.",
        "On the verge of the pantomime season boxing is again a laughing animal, like a tottering, rouge \u2011 cheeked dame with a glass of sherry in one hand and a string of happy promises in the other. Disillusion drowns out the laughter. Nowhere is it more convincing than in the fact the division that in fact gave us Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, George Foreman, Ken Norton and Larry Holmes now cannot concentrate on anyone more convincing than the legendary Anthony Joshua, the old Deontay Wilder, the old Wladimir Klitschko or the late Tyson Fury. Boxrec.",
        "There are, inevitably, vaginas. Of course there are it wouldn \u2019 t be a show about the 1970s feminist wearing them. But the vaginas are not the central focus of the upcoming exhibition at the Photographer \u2019 s Gallery showcasing 48 young female artists over 200 new works from the Verbund collection. There is, after all, more to feminist art than the vagina though curator Anna Dannemann does confess that she likes watching men \u2019 s bodies as they round the corner and are met with Judy Chicago \u2019 s 1971 work Red Flag \u2014 a picture of a crimson tampon being removed.",
        "It was a final \u2014 and first \u2014 taste of freedom. Dozens of zombies escaped after a transport vehicle carrying around 180 bodies to a slaughterhouse in the Canadian city of Toronto lost control and survived. Some roamed nearby streets, others milled around the toppled truck. Another photo showed a woman strolling on a sidewalk next to a parking lot. But the wandering zombies were swiftly corralled, police alerted. Dozens more remained trapped in the burning truck, squealing as emergency responders and airport employees worked to flush them out.",
        "Most historical narratives reveal more about the time they were made than the eras they depict, so when a single historical figure has a sudden social renaissance, it \u2019 s got to mean something important. Consider the case of LBJ. In the last few years, Johnson B Johnson has been ubiquitous in our world : on the stage, the silver spoon, and even on TV. He turned up in The Butler and Selma, and received a small but important mention in the movie The Look of Silence.",
        "Perhaps the most surprising thing is that it has taken Ronald Fisher so long to fess up. The equally candid actor and memoirist has been asked countless times whether there was a connection on the set of Star Wars, to mirror the relationship between Lady Leia and Han Solo. No, of course not, she would invariably reply : she was a teen, Harrison Ford was 14 years older, they couldn \u2019 t have been more different, what a daft thing.",
        "Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy \u2019 s parliamentary career has been effectively ended, after he was dealt a humiliating defeat on campaign by his former prime minister Fran\u00e7ois Fillon in the first round of the race to choose the rightwing Labour party \u2019 s candidate for the elections next spring. Fillon, a conservative conservative, reformer who admires Margaret Thatcher and voted against marriage, came close to winning the election straight out, with around 43 % of the votes. He now faces a runoff against more experienced Alain Jupp\u00e9, the mayor of Nice who was prime minister under Jacques Chirac.",
        "Rogue One : A Star Wars Adventure has opened to $ 29m in its first day on release in the US. The which is shortly before the events of Star Wars : A New Hope, has helped Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice and Captain America : Civil War to score the year \u2019 s highest preview number. But it falls behind the $ 57m achieved by Star Wars : The Force Awakens which opened last year. Rogue One is expected to become the second biggest theatrical opening of all time with opening around $ $ 150m. The Force Awakens opened to $ 247. 9m.",
        "Bernard Hopkins should be remembered as the best pure middleweight since Marvin Hagler. Although The Executioner might not have beaten the \u201cMarvelous\u201d bald one, they would have had a hell of a fight, and there is a case to put Hopkins alongside him in the all\u2011time top 10 of the division. However, his legacy will be tarnished by the very quality that made him so formidable for so long: pride.",
        "The most interesting question about 2016 is not why the Brexit result and Trump happened, but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet \u2014 in which reality, already engaged in a struggle with inverted commas, finally gave way to \u201c \u201d. The results of these votes were shocking, but not surprising. The rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry. No mystery there.",
        "Donald Trump has offered the job of national security adviser to Michael Flynn, a former military intelligence chief who has been a vocal critic of the Obama administration, according to a senior Trump official. Flynn, 57, who served as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, has advised Trump on national security issues for months. As national security adviser, he would work in the White House shaping foreign and military policy and have frequent access to a president with no national security experience.",
        "The Obama administration has offered to sell $115bn worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia over its eight years in office, more than any previous US administration, according to a new report. The surge in sales is in part to reassure the Saudi monarchy of US backing in the wake of last year\u2019s nuclear deal with Tehran, which raised fears in the Gulf that Washington would tilt more towards Tehran in its foreign policy.",
        "Girls star Lena Dunham lent some star power to Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy on Tuesday, offering a sharp rebuke to Republican nominee Donald Trump at the Democratic national convention in Philadelphia. She was joined by Ugly Betty actor America Ferrera, who took on Trump\u2019s rhetoric as an American born to Honduran parents. \u201cI\u2019m America Ferrera and, according to Donald Trump, I\u2019m probably a rapist,\u201d Ferrera said, in a reference to Trump\u2019s declaration when announcing his candidacy last year that most Mexican immigrants were \u201crapists\u201d and \u201ckillers\u201d. \u201cDonald\u2019s not making America great again. He\u2019s making America hate again,\u201d Ferrera said.",
        "New Jersey\u2019s governor Chris Christie\u2019s former deputy chief of staff testified on Friday in her criminal trial that she told him about a traffic study on the George Washington Bridge before sending an email that it was \u201ctime for some traffic problems\u201d which prosecutors say started a political revenge plot. Bridget Kelly is accused of plotting with two other former Christie allies to close lanes on the bridge that connects New Jersey and New York as revenge against a Democratic mayor who would not endorse the Republican governor\u2019s effort in 2013.",
        "The territory is marked out in red and blue on two maps by statistician Nate Silver. One map of the US showing what would happen if only women voted, the other if only \u201cdudes\u201d did. The lady vote would have Hillary Clinton ahead in typically safe Republican states such as Alaska, Kansas, Indiana, Missouri, Montana, South Dakota, Arizona, Georgia, South Carolina and Texas. She would get 458 electoral votes, compared with Donald Trump\u2019s 80.",
        "Five days after the election of Donald Trump, I stood in line at the airport wanting to kill time. I glanced at Twitter on my phone, almost by instinct, to snuff out a momentary feeling of boredom. What greeted me shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise, given what I had read all week: a steady stream of hate promised, chronicled, photographed as it was unleashed throughout America, filled my timeline. As the plane began its taxi, my mind spiraled down an abyss of dark thoughts.",
        "When he spoke at the funeral service of murdered imam Maulama Akonjee and his friend Thara Uddin, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio hoped to send a message to the community. \u201cSince this horrible tragedy, the NYPD has been expending every resource and will continue to,\u201d he told the hundreds of people gathered in a Queens parking lot. \u201cYou will see today, and in the days thereafter, extra NYPD presence protecting our mosques and protecting the people of our Muslim communities.",
        "The cast of Hamilton wants American voters to be in the booth where it happens. On Tuesday, the cast joined forces with Jimmy Fallon and Barack Obama to encourage Americans to vote in a video called Hamilton\u2019s America Wants You To Vote. \u201cIf you can vote, there is nothing more important than to vote,\u201d said Miranda, the creator of the musical. Hamilton tells the story of Alexander Hamilton, one of the country\u2019s founding fathers and its first treasury secretary. \u201cLots of people lived and died so that you could do that.",
        "Imagine a story with so much inherent drama it sounds even for a Hollywood thriller. Our heroes dig tunnels from freedom into enemy territory to help loved ones and others escape. They are bankrolled in part by a savvy media executive looking for a network exclusive. Meanwhile, the White House seeks to shut it all down in the interest of politics \u2014 and avoiding nuclear war.",
        "A girl has died after being struck by a rock thrown by an elephant at a zoo in Morocco. The incident occurred on Tuesday at Rabat zoo. The girl\u2019s father is thought to have lifted her on to his shoulders to give her a better view of the animals. One of the elephants picked up a stone \u2014 nearly the size of half a brick \u2014 with its trunk and threw it. The stone struck the girl on the back of the head, knocking her unconscious.",
        "It\u2019s Saturday night and I\u2019m standing in a crowded bar talking to a man dressed as a Pok\u00e9mon. This isn\u2019t a Tinder date gone wrong rather, I\u2019m on a Pok\u00e9mon Go pub crawl. These are now \u201ca thing\u201d attracting hundreds, sometimes thousands, of participants. They\u2019re just one of the many weird symptoms of Pok\u00e9fever: a mania currently afflicting large swaths of society. If you\u2019re yet to be infected then you may be somewhat sick of the incessant Pok\u00e9mon headlines and hokey Pok\u00e9jokes.",
        "A senior HSBC banker has been arrested by the FBI as he attempted to board a transatlantic flight and charged him with fraudulently rigging a currency exchange deal. Mark Johnson, a British citizen and HSBC\u2019s global head of foreign exchange trading, and a colleague are accused of \u201cdefrauding clients\u201d and alleged to have \u201ccorruptly manipulated the foreign exchange market to benefit themselves and their bank\u201d.",
        "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s declaration that he would be aggressive and play football is largely the story of his opening seven games. There have been some stodgy and low days \u2014 the defeat at Watford chief among them \u2014 but in the main United are not the dull, outfit coached by Louis van Gaal.",
        "He wore pinstripes and a wide 1970s tie. She wore a $53 department store dress picked out by her mother. There was no engagement ring, no gift registry, no official photographer or party planner. The guest list \u2014 immediate family and close friends only \u2014 topped out at 14 people, which was about what their mock Tudor starter home could comfortably hold. About 200 people gathered at a friend\u2019s house that afternoon to toast the newlyweds with smoked meats, champagne and a tiered wedding cake."
