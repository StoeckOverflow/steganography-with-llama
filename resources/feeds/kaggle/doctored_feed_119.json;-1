        "The Chicago Cubs have fired a DJ who became The Prodigy \u2019 s Smack My Bitch Up after reliever Aroldis Chapman left the game against the St Louis Browns on Sunday. Chapman accepted a suspension to begin the year under Major League Baseball \u2019 s new domestic arbitration policy. \u201c We apologize for the irresponsible fan selection during our game Tuesday night, \u201d the Cubs head of baseball operations, Dave Kenney, said in a statement. \u201c The performance of this track showed a lack of judgment and sensitivity to an unrelated issue.",
        "A month ago I tried to write a song proposing mean nicknames for Donald Trump, on the basis that it would be funny to turn the tables on him for the cruel diminutives he applied to people. I couldn \u2019 t pull it off. There is a darkness about Trump that negates that sort of humor : a folly so bewildering, an incompetence so extreme that no insult could plumb its weight. He has run one of the lousiest advertising campaigns ever. In saying so I am not referring to his business decisions or his vulgar remarks about women.",
        "Associations of antisemitism returned to oppose Donald Trump \u2019 s reelection campaign on Sunday, after the president and his allies, including a woman who was a hopeful, were forced again to answer questions about supporters with openly bigoted views. The retired US lieutenant general Mike Flynn retweeted an explicitly antisemitic stance regarding the leak of hundreds of emails from the Democratic National Committee.",

As he walked out of court Shkreli had something more pressing on his mind. He asked his lawyer : \u201c Can I let Pok\u00e9mon Go now? \u201d talking to a New York Daily News reporter who asked the question. Shkreli, who hit the bottom last year after he hiked the limit a drug often costs to people with HIV or AIDS from $ 13.",
        "Monday was a good day for America. Not only did the company celebrate its 240th year of operations but Kellogg \u2019 s launched an cereal chain in New York. It \u2019 s going \u2014 wait for it \u2014 Kellogg \u2019 s New York. It \u2019 s based in Times Square and a bowl of cereal will earn you back $ 7. 50. Yep, that \u2019 s right. $ 7. 50.

        "Apple has lifted the price on a number of and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals after the release of the new MacBook Pro, which received a barrage of criticism for machines with no ports other than the new USB standard. Prices for most adapters Apple bought have been dropped, in some cases by as much as half. The company has also dropped the price of peripherals by 25 % since the 4K and 5K LG screens the company installed late last month, and a SanDisk SD card port has received a special price cut of 40 %.",
        "One of Alaska \u2019 s delegates to the Republican National Convention has filed a legal lawsuit in an effort to stop voting for presumptive nominee Donald Trump at the party convention next month. The businessman, Carroll Correll Jr of Alexandria, Virginia, argued in the case that being forced to vote against his party was a violation of his constitutional right. Correll said he would not vote for Trump because he believed the black businessman was unfit to serve as mayor.",
        "A dozen patients with cerebral palsy lie on plastic mattresses on the floor of a spacious bathroom. A smell of cleaning fluid unsuccessfully masks the smell of urine. Nearby, five children are tied to a thick metal frame. They are bandaged from the head to the ankles, their hands bandaged too, looking half mummified in an attempt to teach them how to stand. There are 19 patients in treatment at Asociaci\u00f3n Hogar Infantil San Luis Gonzaga, an orphanage located in Mexico City.",
        "When I meet Riz Ahmed in the British Film Market in London, he \u2019 s suffering from the cold. Wearing a scruffy beard, casual black jacket and denim shirt, Ahmed looks very for a rising star of independent and Hollywood stars. He is warm and talkative, but also somewhat agitated about the state of the environment. We meet a week after the UK voted to leave the Soviet Union amid tensions. Meanwhile, in the US a Soviet candidate refuses to back down from his proposal to ban all Russians from entering the nation.",
        "Stars including Matthew McConaughey, Sacha Baron Cohen and Tina Fey have all featured in this year \u2019 s list of biggest financial flops. Forbes has released their latest countdown of the 10 least profitable films of the year and 2016 \u2019 s biggest seller is failed superhero series Max Steel. The $ 10m comedy film, based on a Mattel franchise, only brought in $ 4. 4m when released earlier this year after receiving heavy promotion and negative reviews. Slavery drama Free World of Jones, once seen as a top awards contender, was also on the list with a $ 23. 2m return from a $ 50m preview.",
        "There has never been a great time to be a couch TV : an endless stream of programmes, old and new, running online without pricey advertising or satellite packages. Many have called it TV \u2019 s golden age, but some analysts suggest \u201c peak television \u201d is coming to an end. Money is the least of TV \u2019 s problems. In the Netherlands, where the TV economy is huge, TV and internet alone costs two to four times what it does in the UK, and people are in a with Americans, who are increasingly shredding steep cable bills in favor of Netflix and streaming games.",
        "It looks like Richard Jefferson getting away with tripping Kevin Durant on that first possession, expect that to be a matter of discussion for a spell. In any case, it shouldn \u2019 t take too much money from what was about as big of a regular season win that a team could possibly have. There \u2019 s plenty more talk going on today, but this will be the end of our Christmas Day liveblogging. Thanks to everyone who decided to spend a small portion of Christmas with us here at the Guardian. Ciao! Warriors Cavaliers, FINAL, The Cavaliers take a 20 second timeout.",
        "How many trite, stale Asian stereotypes can you cram into four minutes? That\u2019s the question that Jesse Watters, the buffoonish correspondent on Fox News\u2019 The O\u2019Reilly Factor, answered for us earlier this week in his latest \u201cWatters\u2019 World\u201d segment. He takes a trip to Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown, ostensibly to interview Chinese American voters on their thoughts on the presidential election. But it quickly becomes clear that the people he encounters are mere props for his (decidedly unfunny) jokes riffing on stereotypes about massage parlors to herbal medicine.",
        "French police have arrested a man and a woman with ties to Mohamed who killed 84 people and injured hundreds more on Thursday when he drove a truck at high speed into a crowd watching Bastille Day fireworks in Nice. Five other people are already in custody being questioned by police as detectives try to learn more about the Tunisian delivery driver, described as \u201ca soldier\u201d on Saturday by Islamic State, which has claimed the attack. Among those still being questioned is \u2019s estranged wife and mother of his three children.",
        "At least nine people were dead and 25 unaccounted for after a fire broke out during a party in a warehouse in Oakland, city officials said on Saturday. A police spokesman said the death toll could be \u201ca couple dozen\u201d. A city councilman told the Guardian he expected more deaths to be confirmed, and officials were reported to fear as many as 40 people dead inside the building, which is known as the \u201cGhost Ship\u201d. But at an afternoon news briefing, officials did not confirm that number.",
        "One of the first major tasks Hillary Clinton performed on becoming secretary of state was managing Washington\u2019s \u201creset\u201d with Moscow. In March 2009, at a meeting in Zurich with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, she had the idea of symbolising the moment with a gift: a red plastic button set in a yellow box the two diplomats could press together. The button was meant to be labelled with the Russian word for \u201creset\u201d but the state department did not get the translation quite right. The Russian word they chose, peregruzka, actually meant \u201covercharged\u201d.",
        "Stephen Sondheim once gave James Lapine, his friend and longtime collaborator, a useful if inadvertent piece of advice. The two first worked together in the on Sunday in the Park With George, and a revival of their second musical, Into the Woods, is transferring from the US to London this summer. They are very different, says Lapine, when we meet in a rehearsal space near Times Square in New York. Although in life, Sondheim is \u201cthe dark soul and I\u2019m the light one\u201d when it comes to work, Lapine characterises himself as the gloomier of the two.",
        "America\u2019s most likely next first family are retracing familiar steps. For Hillary Clinton, the road to the White House has taken her to a masonic shrine in Pennsylvania where she spoke during her 2008 primary campaign. Some 250 miles west, husband Bill begins a bus tour for her through Ohio by following the route of a trip in his 1992 presidential campaign. Two hours east, their daughter has just done her bit at a rally in the suburbs of Philadelphia where she brought her and breastfeeding son along to watch.",
        "A French human rights association and Muslim groups have said they will take legal action against the mayor of Cannes for issuing a decree banning burkinis from the resort\u2019s beaches. David Lisnard signed off on a ruling last month preventing women from wearing the swimsuits in the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur town. The decree was introduced shortly after the Bastille day attack in Nice in July, where a delivery driver killed 85 people when he ploughed into crowds celebrating the French national holiday on the seafront.",
        "Authorities in Iran have confiscated the passport of the country\u2019s most renowned living artist, Parviz Tanavoli, the day before he was due to speak at the British Museum. Tanavoli told the Observer that he went to Tehran\u2019s international airport on Saturday to take a Lufthansa flight to London but border officials confiscated his passport and barred him from leaving the country without giving any reasons. \u201cI have no idea why they did it,\u201d he said by phone from Tehran. \u201cI have not done anything wrong.",
        "In when it became clear that Riyad Mahrez was following in Jamie Vardy\u2019s footsteps and staying at Leicester City, Claudio Ranieri was asked how many players he imagined he would lose in the wake of winning the Premier League title. \u201cIf I am honest, no one,\u201d the manager said, frowning. \u201cI thought everybody wanted to stay with Leicester and continue to fight. I made a mistake. One did want to go. \u201d N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9\u2019s departure to Chelsea clearly took Ranieri by surprise.",
        "Elon Musk\u2019s solar company has its sights set on replacing 5m rooftops in the US with traditional roofing materials integrated with solar cell technology. SolarCity\u2019s plans, announced last month, to develop traditional roofs made entirely from solar panels are part of a goal to make sustainable homes more aesthetically appealing, convenient, and ultimately affordable to the average homeowner. It\u2019s betting that people who need to replace their roofs will be attracted to the company\u2019s solar cell option because it won\u2019t require additional work or dramatically alter the look of the home.",
        "Nasa scientists have received their first glimpse of Jupiter\u2019s north pole and the auroras rippling across its southern pole, with new images sent from the agency\u2019s Juno spacecraft. \u201cIt looks like nothing we have seen or imagined before,\u201d said Scott Bolton, Juno\u2019s principal investigator. \u201cIt\u2019s bluer in color up there than other parts of the planet, and there are a lot of storms. \u201d Juno reached Jupiter in early July, after a nearly journey to the gas giant that ended with a delicate maneuver into orbit past the planet\u2019s intense bands of radiation.",
        "Samantha Bee has criticized Donald Trump\u2019s performance in the final debate, referring to him as a \u201c Berlusconi \u201d. In this week\u2019s episode of Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, the host discussed the Republican candidate\u2019s poor performance last week, claiming that his policy positions were decided \u201cby dumping out Risk on to the floor and reading the pieces like tea leaves\u201d.

        "As Wayne Rooney\u2019s wait for the goal that will equal Sir Bobby Charlton\u2019s record goes on, Zlatan Ibrahimovic continues to carry the torch for a Manchester United side who are running into form at just the right time. With another two goals, the Swede took his tally for the season to 16 \u2014 and 10 in his last nine games \u2014 to complete a highly satisfactory week for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and his players.",
        "Arthur C Clarke famously said there are just two possibilities: that we are alone in the universe, or we aren\u2019t, and both are equally terrifying. The first terror is harder to put on film, but director Denis Villeneuve brings the second to life with this freaky and audacious contact \u2014 and makes it something other than terror.",
        "Staked out next to the parking lot at the National Rifle Association\u2019s biggest of the year, I asked NRA members to explain what, exactly, the liberal media was getting wrong about the gun debate. We were outside the Louisville convention center because the NRA had refused media credentials to the Guardian for its event, which it said had attracted more than 80, 000 people.",
        "The Cannonball river flows into the mighty Missouri about 50 miles due south of Bismarck, North Dakota. At its confluence, a protest encampment \u2014 really a series of camps, on both sides of the Cannonball, strewn with kitchens and canteens, portable toilets, stabling for horses, sweat lodges and tall teepees, and stands selling indigenous art \u2014 has sprung up.
