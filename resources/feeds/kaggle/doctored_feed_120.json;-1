Crucially, they did not omit Sergio Ag\u00fcero, and two of the game \u2019 s scruffier goals were enough for Liverpool to take the points after dropping behind. \u201c They were beautiful men, \u201d a beaming Pep Guardiola insisted.",

        "The breakout star of this current season may very well be a punter. If that sounds like some kind of backhanded compliment of a 2016 NFL franchise that has seen poor attendance and declining ratings, maybe it is. But it \u2019 s not intentional because, well... have you heard Marquette King lately? The guy has legitimately made punting famous. Punting. Fun.
