        "Three Allied ships and a US tanker that sank in the Java Sea during the second world war have been destroyed by illegal sea metal scavengers, the Guardian can see. The UK \u2019 s Ministry of Defense said it condemned the \u201c unauthorised searching of any wreck containing war remains \u201d and requested national authorities investigate and take \u201c appropriate action \u201d. The alleged salvaging of war wrecks has caused considerable upset among sailors, historians and governments who seek to preserve the final resting place of sailors who went down with their ships.",
        "Next week sees the arrival of the children \u2019 s drama Stranger Things, a supernatural chiller about a missing child, which pays homage to everything from Twin Peaks to Poltergeist and has been described by several critics as \u201c looking like the show Steven Spielberg and Stephen King never created \u201d. It also marks the third, and perhaps most important, role in Winona Ryder \u2019 s return to television \u2019 s spotlight.",
        "Nearly all of the refugees who stayed in the now demolished transit camp for refugees have a psychiatric health condition such as panic disorder or depression, according to psychiatric assessments of some of those attempting to come to Britain. Evidence compiled by a psychiatrist for Citizens UK, which is supporting treatment of children dispersed within France, suggests that their mental health is deteriorating amid ongoing delays over their transfer. Following the demolition of the camp, the camp \u2019 s staff report hearing suicidal text messages from the survivors.",
        "About halfway into his Guide to Death : an Oral Tale, Casey Jarman lets the public in on the impetus of the project : \u201c I wrote this [ book ] in the hopes of beating death altogether. \u201d It \u2019 s an impossible concept \u2014 the reader knows it, the artist knows it \u2014 but not a disingenuous one, and Jarman \u2019 s writing debut is a testament to the value of doggedly achieving a goal that has never and can ever be realized. We can \u2019 t beat death, but maybe we can beat enough of it.",
        "Somehow Donald Trump manages to lay down everything. Somehow he gets to lower the bar to the level where he can play by a different set of rules. And somehow the president and elected officials just shrug their shoulders and walk away. By his own admission, the is negotiating foreign deals at a time when his ancestors were, you know, filling key positions and transitioning to power. He meets with his Indian business partners and the Trump Organization arranged a Kolkata deal every week.",
        "The basic theme of the biopic has grown almost unbearably tiresome, due largely to the annual production of mostly uninspiring Oscarbait true stars that serve to do nothing but lure actors \u2019 \u201c range \u201d. Could the world have stopped thinking if The Danish Girl or Trumbo had actually been released? As a response to the crisis, have been making more \u201c constructed biopics \u201d combining elements, ideas and ideas then mashing them together to make something less familiar.",
        "Hours after a controversial video emerged in which Donald Trump bragged about groping women without their consent, Florida Representative Marco Rubio condemned the Democratic nominee \u2019 s comments as \u201c vulgar, egregious [ and ] unable to justify \u201d. But as Republicans demanded from Trump en masse on Trump and in many cases calling on him to step aside, Rubio did not rescind his endorsement of the former reality TV star. Rubio has avoided appearing alongside the nominee, a notable absence from Trump \u2019 s three appearances in Florida in recent months, and has no plans to speak with him before election day.",
        "There \u2019 s a paradox in the way Dallas police chief John Brown has handled the crisis in his city this past month. The words he says sound detached from, and even different to, his manner. \u201c That I \u2019 m able to stand here and discuss this with you is a testament to God \u2019 s kindness and his sweet, tender mercies, \u201d he said at a news conference on CBS. His face looked like granite. His voice sounded as even as his pressed shirt. \u201c I \u2019 m running on fumes, \u201d he said.",
        "After reversing course a month earlier on false claims about Barack Obama \u2019 s government, Donald Trump took a familiar stance on another favourite theme on Facebook, telling an audience in person he would save many lives by securing the elections. \u201c Our nation should not accept one lost American presidency because our country failed to enforce its laws, \u201d the Republican Presidential candidate said. \u201c This has to end. It will end if I become President, I promise you. \u201d The event at which Obama spoke, in Houston, was opened to press.",
        "More than 484, 000 Google keyword hits a month from around the globe, including at least 54, 000 pages in the UK, return users dominated by Islamist extremist material, a move into the online presence of jihadism has shown. The study found that of the extremist sites accessible through these specific keyword accounts, 44 % was explicitly violent, 36 % was and 20 % was entirely Islamist in content, the last being but disseminated by mainstream Islamist groups with political convictions.",
        "SeaWorld shares sank to a record low on stock after the controversial aquatic adventure park company saw further falls in attendance and profits. The company, which induces killer whales, dolphins and sea lions to perform tricks to entertain the public, said 494, 000 fewer visitors visited its parks in the six months to the end of September compared with the same period a month earlier. The 7. 7 % drop in attendance, from 6. 5 to six million, shaved more than $ 16m off SeaWorld \u2019 s quarterly earnings and spooked customers and investors, sending the company \u2019 s shares down 14. 2 % to $ 12.",
        "A Tunisian Army doctor seeking to help his son who had joined Islamic State in Syria was amongst those killed in Tuesday \u2019 s suicide attack at Istanbul Airport, according to security officials. Three suspected Isis suicide bombers opened fire and blew themselves up in Istanbul \u2019 s international airport on Tuesday night, killing 41 people and wounding 239, in what is the deadliest of a series of suicide bombings this year in Turkey. The Tunisian defense ministry confirmed that Major General Fathi Bayoudh, a military medical doctor, was among those killed.",
        "Twitter has blocked federally funded \u201cdomestic spy centers\u201d from using a powerful social media monitoring tool after public records revealed that the government had special access to users\u2019 information for controversial surveillance efforts. The American Civil Liberties Union of California discovered that fusion centers, which collect intelligence, had access to monitoring technology from Dataminr, an analytics company partially owned by Twitter. The ACLU\u2019s records prompted the companies to announce that Dataminr had terminated access for all fusion centers and would no longer provide social media surveillance tools to any local, state or federal government entities.",
        "Across bone dry Arizona, voters and pollsters have begun to ask openly about a change that seemed nearly impossible not so long ago: could Democrats take the American west? Hillary Clinton\u2019s allies charged across the region this week, led by Michelle Obama, who spoke on Thursday of hope, joy and possibility in this, the greatest country on earth. She told the screaming supporters packed into the Phoenix Convention Center that Clinton knows \u201cour country is powerful and vibrant and strong, big enough to have a place for all of us. \u201d Then she got down to business. Arizona business.",
        "Tens of thousands of workers will protest at 20 different airports including Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare international airport and New Jersey\u2019s Newark Liberty on 29 November, according to organizers from the group Fight for 15. In addition to the strike at airports, workers, home care and childcare workers also plan to protest as part of the Fight for $15 movement calling for a $ minimum wage and union rights. Terrence Wise, a McDonald\u2019s worker from Kansas City, Missouri, said Donald Trump\u2019s election had reaffirmed the group\u2019s determination to push for change.",
        "Hillary Clinton lost her bid for the White House, and the National Rifle Association\u2019s 2016 champion Donald Trump is almost certain to leave firearm regulations alone. But America\u2019s appetite for guns is more voracious than ever. The FBI\u2019s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) processed more background checks for gun transactions on Black Friday \u2014 185, 713 in total \u2014 than on any single day since the system launched nearly two decades ago, an agency spokesperson told the Trace.",
        "The Federal Reserve detected more than 50 cyber breaches between 2011 and 2015, with several incidents described internally as \u201cespionage\u201d according to Fed records. The US central bank\u2019s staff suspected hackers or spies in many of the incidents, the records show. The Fed\u2019s computer systems play a critical role in global banking and hold confidential information on discussions about monetary policy that drives financial markets. The cybersecurity reports, obtained by Reuters through a Freedom of Information Act request, were heavily redacted by Fed officials to keep secret the central bank\u2019s security procedures.",
        "Early last Thursday morning, as the champagne flew in the Chicago Cubs clubhouse, Fox put to bed a rollicking World Series that smashed all expectations of what modern baseball can do on television with a 25. 2 rating for Game 7. Later that night, on the NFL Network, the Atlanta Falcons clobbered the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and drew a 3. 2 rating, a 35% drop from the same Thursday night game last year.",
        "Hillary Clinton has not won the presidential election. Granted, the polls look good. The New York Times gives her a 92% chance at taking the White House as of Thursday morning, and more Republican elites are defecting from their party\u2019s nominee each day. Data hub FiveThirtyEight\u2019s numbers are a little more modest, putting Trump\u2019s odds of victory just north of 15%. Evan McMullin \u2014 the conservative independent candidate \u2014 could even win his home state of Utah, fueled by Republican recoiling. But not every picture is so rosy.",
        "Jeremy Clarkson\u2019s new motoring show has become the most illegally downloaded television programme in history, figures suggest. Amazon paid a reported $160m (\u00a3130m) for three series of The Grand Tour, which stars former Top Gear presenters Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, after Clarkson was sacked by the BBC in March 2015. But figures from Muso, data analysts of the piracy market, suggest unprecedented numbers of people are avoiding paying \u00a379 a year to sign up for Amazon\u2019s online streaming service, Amazon Prime, and instead downloading the show illegally.",
        "Phil Chess, of a Chicago\u2019s Chess Records, the label that amassed the most influential blues catalogue and has been credited with helping to invent rock\u2019n\u2019roll, has died at home in Tuscon, Arizona. He was 95. Nephew Craig Glicken told the Chicago on Wednesday that Chess died overnight at his ranch and said his uncle had been in good health. Chess and his brother, Leonard, who were both Jewish immigrants from Poland, founded Chess Records in 1950 on the Southside of Chicago.",
        "A Canadian couple found guilty of planting homemade bombs outside a government building will walk free after a court in British Columbia ruled the pair was entrapped by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) into carrying out a \u201c crime\u201d. John Nuttall, 41, and Amanda Korody, 33, were found guilty of terror charges last year after they planted inert pressure cooker bombs on the steps of British Columbia\u2019s provincial legislature in 2013, ahead of Canada Day celebrations that drew thousands of revellers to the area.",
        "Donald Trump, a billionaire, wants billionaire heiress Betsy DeVos to take over the Department of Education. These two people have never attended public schools. Nor have they sent their kids to them. Yet they will likely accelerate the bipartisan dismantling of public education as we know it. Private foundations, billionaires and Wall Street hedge fund managers have funneled billions of dollars either directly into the education system or the political process to influence policy.",
        "It is now the greatest movement of the uprooted that the world has ever known. Some 65 million people have been displaced from their homes, 21. 3 million of them refugees for whom flight is virtually compulsory \u2014 involuntary victims of politics, war or natural catastrophe. With just less than 1% of the world\u2019s population homeless and seeking a better, safer life, a global crisis is under way, exacerbated by a lack of political cooperation \u2014 and several states, including the United Kingdom, are flouting international agreements designed to deal with the crisis.",
        "Silicon Valley venture capitalist and billionaire Vinod Khosla, who has been engaged in a legal battle over public access to a beloved surfing beach that sits on his land, is suing two state agencies accusing them of using \u201ccoercion and harassment\u201d to take away his private property rights \u2014 an allegation one campaign group describes as \u201cabsurd\u201d.

        "So Andy Murray is still the Olympic champion. That\u2019s all from me tonight. Thanks for reading and emailing. Night! Andy Murray manages to remember all the words of the national anthem, singing along as it blares around Centre Court. Then the three of them come together for a group photo. Murray manages another awkward grin. He\u2019s so very . .. Murray. But gold goes to Great Britain\u2019s Andy Murray. Four years after beating Roger Federer in London, he\u2019s done it again, defeating Del Potro in an epic final. He just about manages a smile.",
        "The habits of New York\u2019s whale population are to be fully analysed for the first time, with scientists hoping the new information will help protect the marine behemoths that navigate one of the busiest shipping areas in the world. An acoustic monitoring buoy has been deployed off the coast of Long Island to eavesdrop on the cacophony of underwater noises made by whales that feed and travel through New York waters. Data from the research project will plug a surprising gap in scientists\u2019 knowledge of the world\u2019s largest creatures.",
        "As bullish statements of intent go, the first track released from Lambchop\u2019s 12th album took some beating. Kurt Wagner\u2019s Nashville collective have long been more eclectic than the tag suggests, tackling everything from soul to lounge music, but they\u2019ve never tried anything like The Hustle\u2019s 18 largely instrumental minutes of chugging house beats, softly pulsing electronics, abstract woodwind and sparse flecks of piano. It\u2019s utterly lovely, a phrase you could also usefully apply to JFK\u2019s haze of vocodered vocals and jazzy piano, or Harbour County\u2019s glitchy synths and echoing guitar.",
        "Seven British paintings have been removed from the walls of galleries and replaced with fakes in the name of a national TV competition. Sky Arts said they had organised the deception with the full cooperation of galleries that include the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh and the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. During July, people will be able to look at a number of paintings knowing that one of them is a fake.",
        "America\u2019s first family has finally weighed in on the upcoming presidential election. No, not the Obamas, who made their feelings plain at the Democratic convention last week \u2014 the Simpsons. The Fox comedy show released a short clip on YouTube late on Sunday night, showing Homer and Marge Simpson watching a political advertisement on television in order to settle who they plan to vote for. The ad in question follows the format of Hillary Clinton\u2019s famous \u201c3am\u201d spot from the 2008 Democratic presidential primary, with a severe voiceover asking the animated couple \u201cwho [they] want answering the call\u201d."
