        "US politicians have been dining at the former speakeasy \u2019 s coveted space since Franklin D Roosevelt more than 80 years ago, and it is reputed that John F Kennedy spent the eve of his birthday there. So Manhattan \u2019 s famed 21 Subway, a New York resident since prohibition, provided a fitting venue for the Donald J Trump, and his six children and their partners to return this week for celebrations. Swerving the disgruntled White House press circus, the billionaire businessman sped by motorcade to 21 West 52nd Street, a hangout for politicians and captains of industry.",
        "On Saturday, 7 October, Joshua Brown was riding his Tesla Model S on US 27 in Tampa Florida. He had the car \u2019 s Autopilot warning package switched on. A wide, white articulated truck heading in the opposite direction suddenly turned right across the Tesla \u2019 s path, heading for a sideroad. Neither the car \u2019 s drivers or systems saw the crash and neither, it seems, did Mr Brown. The Tesla ploughed into \u2014 and under \u2014 the truck, drove off the road, hit a fence and an electric power supply before coming to a stop. Mr Brown died instantly in the crash.",
        "Here \u2019 s the problem with shopping : it makes the holidays very exciting. Particularly when it comes to. Of course, most Americans are content with something expensive and expensive under the Christmas laws. But what about those feminists who demand presents that don \u2019 t shake up the patriarchy, gifts that don \u2019 t give in to negative stereotypes, trinkets that don \u2019 t trade in transmisogyny and toys that don \u2019 t objectify? It \u2019 s a minefield, basically \u2014 and one you should tread alone. Everyone knows feminists don \u2019 t have a sense of humour.",
        "Just what does Steve Bannon think? For some, his thinking can be boiled down to science. For others, he is merely a radical opportunist taking advantage of politics and the \u201c \u201d a movement in the US, for political gain and fame. But what if he is fundamentally possessed by something else? Third : religion. During a 2014 conference convened by the very conservative Human Dignity Group at the Vatican, Bannon laid out his principles in \u201c traditionalism \u201d.",
        "As a man, I tend to define myself by the things I don \u2019 t have. I don \u2019 t have a fancy Lamborghini or a conspicuous tattoo or a tendency to jumpstart my libido. Nor do I possess a penchant for extreme sex or expensive psychotherapy. Midway through my fourth decade, I \u2019 ve avoided the obvious pitfalls and reckon I \u2019 m coping quite well, which is why I am on my way to discuss the male midlife problem with the therapist Andrew J Marshall, who has written a paper on the subject. It \u2019 s a task that needs a cool and dispassionate eye.",
        "Republican Donald Trump will become the next US president. One will be wondering who, among the estimated 129 million voters in the 2016 election, Trump has to thank for his choices. Possibly, not most of them. Current projections claim that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton might also claim a larger percentage of the popular vote.",
        "One month after launching its pilot project in its home town of San Francisco, Uber is packing up its pilot trial and taking its line of autonomous vehicles to Tucson, Arizona. \u201c Our cars departed for Arizona this morning by morning, \u201d an Uber spokesperson said in a voice. \u201c We \u2019 ll be expanding our pilot there in the next few weeks, and we \u2019 re excited to have the help of Governor Ducey.",
        "Lena Dunham has often condemned Kanye West \u2019 s \u201c sickening \u201d new music video, citing it \u201c one of the more disturbing \u2018 artistic \u2019 efforts in recent decade \u201d. The provocative video for Famous, which featured naked likenesses of celebrities in costumes alongside with West and his wife, Kim Kardashian, debuted on Saturday night. Among the celebrities shown as though two in a row on an enormous bed are George W Bush, Donald Trump, magazine editor Anna Wintour, Bill Cosby, Rihanna, Caitlyn Jenner, Taylor Swift and West \u2019 s wife, Kim Kardashian.",
        "Yes, alcohol disrupts the memory system. But, in very limited circumstances, it can actually affect recall. This is the phenomenon known as recall. External recall can help you recall a memory you \u2019 re better able to recall it if you are in the same environment where the memory was stored. But, and here \u2019 s the clever bit, this rarely applies to the internal system, or \u201c state \u201d hence memory. To put it simply, drugs such as alcohol or stimulants or anything that alters motor activity bring about a normal neurological state.",
        "Manchester United are through to the Europa League group stage courtesy of Henrikh Mkhitaryan \u2019 s brilliant first goal for the season and Zlatan Ibrahimovic \u2019 s late finish. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho \u2019 s team finished fifth in their group, however, so will be unseeded in United \u2019 s draw for the round of 32. A dramatic away win in the group was marred by an outbreak of rain during the interval, moreover, and there was disappointment for David Rooney, who remains third on 248 goals and still in need of two more to become the competition \u2019 s record scorer.",
        "After scoring four goals, eliminating their opponent Montreal Impact from the MLS playoffs, and advancing to the fourth MLS Cup in franchise history, Toronto FC got down to the important task of discussing Drake. \u201c You \u2019 re welcome to join Drake and Drake on the town, \u201d a member of the league \u2019 s staff \u2014 probably Dave Bradley, the communications chief \u2014 yelled to players outside a crowded locker room. Drake, the 6 God, was not, in fact, waiting for the players.",
        "Donald Trump \u2019 s shock trip to Russia has the potential to shake up the US presidential election as the Republican candidate continues in an attempt to \u201c soften \u201d what has been one of his most hardline and controversial campaign areas \u2014 immigration. Scheduled to take place just hours before Obama will finally spell out a new immigration policy after 14 years on the campaign trail, it will mark the first time that Donald has met with a head of state since becoming the Republican nominee and only his second road trip as a candidate.",
        "\u201c Tonight, all the sporting programmes on TV are about football, \u201d Ezequiel Fernandez Moores, Argentina \u2019 s national sports columnist, contacted me from Buenos Aires. He has just arrived home on the underground, and said that the arrivals board read \u201c No te vayas Lio \u201d : Lio, don \u2019 t go. That phrase had been trending on social media since the early hours of Monday, when the Argentine captain announced, in protest, that he had quit international football after defeat in the Copa Am\u00e9rica final to Chile. Messi missed a penalty in the shootout and the decision extended Argentina \u2019 s medal drought to 23 years.",
        "The Queen\u2019s granddaughter Zara Tindall and her husband, Mike, have lost their baby, a spokeswoman for the couple has said. The couple had been expecting their second child around the end of spring 2017. Their first daughter, Mia, will be three next month. Zara, an equestrian champion, and Mike, a former England rugby player, announced the pregnancy at the end of November. On Saturday a spokeswoman for the couple said: \u201cVery sadly, Zara and Mike Tindall have lost their baby. At this difficult time, we ask that everyone respects their privacy.",
        "SeaWorld announced an aggressive strategy on Tuesday as the controversial aquatic theme park company reported a further 33% decline in profits. The company, which has been struggling to win back customers since the 2013 documentary Blackfish detailed claims of mistreatment of orca whales and other animals, reported that its third quarter income had fallen from $98m to $66m. Chief executive Joe Manby warned investors to expect annual profits to come in at between $ . It is the third time the company has cut its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) target this year.",
        "A man suspected in the killing of two Mississippi nuns who were found dead inside a residence within the community they served has been arrested and charged with two counts of capital murder, Mississippi authorities said. Rodney Earl Sanders, 46, of Kosciusko, Mississippi, was charged in the deaths of Sister Margaret Held and Sister Paula Merrill, both 68, Mississippi department of public safety spokesman Warren Strain said in a statement released late on Friday night.",
        "Not long after I finished In the Heat of the Night, I went skiing in Idaho and my son broke his leg. Sitting opposite me in the hospital was the then junior senator for New York, Robert F Kennedy, whose son had broken his leg too. I told him I\u2019d been working on a film about a black detective in a southern town. He said it could be an important film. He told me timing was everything \u2014 in politics, art and life. It was 1966 and the US was going through traumatic times with the civil rights movement.",
        "Most athletes who want to improve their performance do not consult retired geography teachers turned missionaries. But it worked for David Rudisha, and for the other Kenyan athletes who have won 39 medals at the last four Olympics under the tutelage of Colm O\u2019Connell. O\u2019Connell, now 67, came to Kenya from Ireland in 1976. He has no personal background in athletics or formal training as a coach he started working with athletes as a means of pursuing his vocation as a missionary.",
        "If you use Facebook, or Twitter, have a connection, watch television or have been to an office Halloween party, you\u2019ve probably encountered them: internet memes. These shareable, sometimes pithy and often puerile units of culture have emerged as the lingua franca of the 2016 election, and have given the American people an entirely new way of articulating their beliefs. Clinton\u2019s top tweet is a meme. Trump\u2019s taco bowl became one. Through memes, Ted Cruz was \u201cunmasked\u201d as the Zodiac killer. Jeb Bush\u2019s limp plea for applause got him Vined into oblivion.",
        "There\u2019s an election on Tuesday, and voters in Grant County, Oregon, face a stark choice. They have to choose their sheriff, and the result of that race will resonate far beyond the county. Many observers will see it as a referendum on the gains made in the west last year by the Patriot movement. Just as in the presidential race, those involved see it as having an almost existential significance. \u201cThis is a pivotal moment in the history of Grant County, and the entire west,\u201d says Todd McKinley, the wiry, contender who\u2019s hoping to dislodge the incumbent, Glenn Palmer.",
        "The 2016 membership invite list for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is 46% women and 41% people of color, the most diverse intake yet, according to the organization\u2019s figures. The list of the class of 683 new members invited \u2014 including America Ferrera, Tina Fey, and Kate Beckinsale \u2014 to join the organization was released on Wednesday, a substantial step in addressing critiques over the Academy\u2019s lack of racial diversity, following a furor in January after no actors of color were nominated for any major awards for the second year in a row.",
        "Charmian Carr, who played Liesl von Trapp in The Sound of Music, has died at the age of 73. The actor\u2019s spokesman said she died on Saturday in Los Angeles, of complications from a rare form of dementia. Carr was best known for her role in the Rodgers and Hammerstein\u2019s 1965 film, in which she performed the song Sixteen Going On Seventeen. She was a college student when she auditioned for the film, which also starred Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer.",
        "It turns out that the New York Times\u2019 editorial board, the Washington Post\u2019s editorial board and Donald Trump can find one thing on which to agree: they all believe that US supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg ought not to have openly criticized the presumptive Republican nominee \u2014 let alone, presumably, doubled down on her comments. Though the newspapers might believe that Trump\u2019s statement \u2014 \u201cHer mind is shot \u2014 resign!\u201d \u2014 went too far, he\u2019s clearly not the only person wondering what the justice was thinking, given the recent tradition of justices remaining above the political fray.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s choice of Georgia congressman Tom Price as health and human services secretary suggests his campaign rhetoric attacking Obamacare was more than mere bluster. In Price\u2019s 12 years in Congress, he has been a fierce critic of Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare legislation while championing conservative proposals, such as selling insurance across state lines, replacing Medicare with a system of vouchers and transforming Medicaid into a block grant. A close ally of the House speaker, Paul Ryan, he has voted to repeal Obamacare dozens of times.",
        "Even on a midweek morning, the line for Al\u2019s Breakfast, a establishment in the Dinkytown neighbourhood of Minneapolis, runs all the way out of the door. At the back of the queue stands Justin Vernon, sweltering in the heat and sharing his latest preoccupations: the wonder that Apple once sacked Steve Jobs the exceptional difficulty of ever pinning James Blake down to a precise meeting time and place and the lessons of Idiocracy, Mike Judge\u2019s uncomfortably prophetic film satire in which celebrity culture and are rife and a blustering dunderhead has been elected president.",
        "A meeting in Paris between Donald Trump\u2019s son and a Syrian politician with strong ties to Russia has strengthened expectations that the new US administration will side with Moscow in the conflict. The meeting Donald Trump Jr attended at the Paris Ritz on 11 October, reported in the Wall Street Journal, was by Randa Kassis, who runs a Syrian group portrayed as the \u201cpatriotic opposition\u201d by Moscow. Kassis is widely viewed as by many dissidents, because she advocates political transition in cooperation with the Syrian leader, Bashar and because of her strong support of Russian intervention.",
        "Final thoughts, I said it before the game, it felt like this was the Game 7. Obviously, if the Warriors lost, they would have been eliminated. The Thunder, on the other hand, have to be major underdogs now. Not only do they have to absorb this loss but they\u2019re going to be playing at Golden State\u2019s home court, and we\u2019ve seen how dangerous the Warriors can be at home. Still, the Thunder have been defying odds throughout these playoffs and if any team can pull off the Game 7 road victory, it\u2019s this Oklahoma City team.",
        "Cristiano Ronaldo has won the Ballon d\u2019Or award for the fourth time, capping a season in which his Portugal side won Euro 2016 and his club, Real Madrid, took the Champions League. \u201cA great honour to receive my fourth golden ball,\u201d Ronaldo said upon receiving the award at the Bernab\u00e9u. \u201cThe emotion is like the first one. It\u2019s the dream come true again. I never thought in my mind to win the golden ball four times so I\u2019m so pleased and happy.",
        "Imagine for a moment the interior hubbub that occurs as any audience member watches a play: all those neurons, all those synapses, all those chemicals struggling to make sense of the bodies, the lights and the dialogue. It seems remarkable that we manage to sort all that information into something approaching a coherent narrative. But as a character in Nick Payne\u2019s clever and poignant Incognito explains: \u201cThe brain is a storytelling machine\u201d desperate to glean meaning. In other words, we are programmed to draw parallels among the various characters and scenes that Payne and director Doug Hughes unfurl.",
        "Liverpool remain a work in progress but it\u2019s coming together promisingly. During J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s first campaign at Anfield the players adapted quickly to his system and regularly disrupted the opposition\u2019s passing but they only sporadically formulated quick, incisive attacking moves themselves. This season things have improved significantly. The pressing is still impressively efficient and remains an extremely useful way of creating chances but Liverpool\u2019s passing interplay makes them a more complete attacking force. Their 69 shots on target this season is the most in the Premier League."
