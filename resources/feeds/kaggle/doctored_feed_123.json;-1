        "A study by scientists in Brazil that suggests a direct link between the Zika virus and large, but severe, joint deformities in adults has led experts to conclude that the virus could be related to a host of other problems in infants, some of which might only become apparent as they get older. Experts say the study opens up the idea that microcephaly, a condition in which babies are born with abnormally small heads, may just be one facet of a congenital Zika virus epidemic.",
        "Facebook has suggested using location drawing to suggest potential problems amid questions about the unsettling nature with which it puts forward \u201c something you may know \u201d.

        "Perhaps the golfing press will smile upon the poor man. Shane Lowry \u2019 s British Open bid may have been fatally undermined by the calling of a penalty upon himself on Oakmont \u2019 s 16th green, his seventh, during the belated end of round two on Monday. Instead, the Irishman heads into trouble whilst holding a lead in the second major of 2016. The next day, plus potentially most prize of Lowry \u2019 s career awaits. He won \u2019 t be seen in support. The penalty shot \u2014 Lowry \u2019 s ball moved so late upon address before hand \u2014 clearly did nothing to match the \u2019 s ambition.",

        "In an effort to reflect the reality of immigration problems on the southern US border, Breitbart News claimed to have \u201c \u201d a full profile of a Border Patrol agent, which they blasted as \u201c legitimate news \u201d. The rightwing site accused the Guardian of disseminating false ground for reporting a fundamental and demonstrably provable truth : that the number of undocumented border crossers is reaching a historic low.

        "This was a cauldron of noise throughout and at the end a Turkey win delighted Northern fans as it confirmed a place in the group stage on their debut at a major championship.

The deforestation coincided with an 0. 6 degree elevation rise.",
        "Marie Antoinette still had sheep perfumed and dyed cheerful colors for her amusement. Modern urban urbanites, lacking space for children, can now do that to their dogs. As ever growing numbers of people treat their dogs as children, everything from luxury clothing intended for dogs to baby shoes specifically made for a tot of the breed have sprung up. So it is perhaps not surprising that the boom in spending on pet care, estimated at $ 62bn for 2016 in the US, has now also spawned large pet hotels.",

        "Ahead of the announcement of his debut album I See You, which came out on Friday, frontman Lanez is contemplating the event that inspired him to pursue music in the first place.

        "\u201cWhat if I\u2019d had more time?\u201d Across the US, it is the question public defenders often find themselves asking the most. Would a young, pregnant African American woman in Lexington, Kentucky, who faces minor fraud charges laid down in April still be in jail if her lawyer had the time to appeal against an impossible $40, 000 bail bond? Could the illiterate white man in Cole County, Missouri, charged in August with vehicular assault and facing over a decade in prison, ever be assigned an attorney with the resources to defend him?",
