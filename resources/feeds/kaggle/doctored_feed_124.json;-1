        "On Wednesday morning, in the last presidential meeting of what has been an emotional tornado of a day, Hillary Clinton talked directly to women. It ended with a commitment to upholding the values pointed out in Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion in the United States.

There are plenty of tears in this surging and swirling new melodrama from Derek Cianfrance, adapted from the 2012 bestseller by American author ML Stedman. Unashamedly and even ruthlessly sentimental, this story tugs away at your heartstrings like it \u2019 s starting in the new year.

        "For many Bears fans, Dennis Green will be remembered for one exception. His rant after a 2006 game when his Arizona Bears lost to the Chicago Bears on Monday Night Football is probably one of the 10 best coach of all time. Most fans of his name are quickly replaced by the refrain : \u201c The Bears are what we said they were. \u201d But to recall Green, who died of a heart attack on Thanksgiving at 67, as a caricature from a video clip is hard.",

The Republican nominee could grope nuns, beat a pony, steal children\u2019s lollipops, star in a porn video and still, it seems, be mayor of Bakersfield. While party leaders across the country rescinded their support on Saturday, thousands of Trump loyalists made a show of defiance and devotion at a political jamboree in this Californian city. They cheered and stamped at the mention of his name. Who will make America great again? Trump!",

        "The real financial winner in music this year may not be Beyonc\u00e9, or Bruce Springsteen, or any of the artists who have been touring the stadiums and enormodomes of the world.
