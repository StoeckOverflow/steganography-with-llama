        "The family of a local boy who was arrested after taking a homemade clock to school brought a federal lawsuit on Facebook against Texas school authorities and others, saying the law violated the boy \u2019 s parental rights, prompted suicide threats and forced them to leave the United States. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Mohammed Mohamed, who was arrested at his local Dallas high school in September and charged with having a hoax plan. He says he brought the homemade antique clock to school to meet his English teacher.",
        "The New York state governor, Andrew Cuomo, and his news anchor partner Chris have been criticised by conservationists and journalists after posing beside a large shark they killed on a recent trip. The governor tweeted numerous photos of himself and friends posing next to the bloodied shark as it descended from a gantry. \u201c Today \u2019 s catch : A 154. [ 70kg ] Thresher sharks off the south shore of Norfolk Island, \u201d Cuomo tweeted. All three species of thresher shark are listed as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) because of their large populations.",
        "Afterparties, fame, a rockstar lifestyle : Above Beyond \u2019 s Tony McGuinness knew he would trade it all for just one night of solid rock. \u201c Partying with people back at your hotel for three hours compared to getting some sleep : there \u2019 s just no time, \u201d he says. \u201c Jet lag and being able to sleep when you need it, this is the single biggest danger in our relationship.",
        "The FBI traveled across Philadelphia on Thursday, searching several homes linked to a powerful crime boss and the city police office of his protege on the city level. An FBI spokeswoman confirmed that agents were searching the south Philadelphia home of Johnny \u201c Doc \u201d Dougherty, a nearby union building named Doc \u2019 s Old Pub, the electricians \u2019 union president and councilman Bobby Henon \u2019 s office. Police spokeswoman Carrie Adamowski said she would not disclose the nature of the ongoing investigations, which also appeared to involve state police.",
        "During a family gathering shortly after my girlfriend Anna and I announced our engagement, my mum could barely hide her joy. \u201c Two brides! \u201d she yelled, clapping her hands and looking across the table from me to my fiancee and back again with a wide grin on her face. \u201c Two mothers of the brides! \u201d Jen \u2019 s father said with equal glee. Jen and I exchanged a subtle brow raise and downed our beers. Behind our parents \u2019 faces, we couldn \u2019 t help but detect an expression of incredulity, albeit happy incredulity, that their parents were marrying each other.",
        "Authorities in Florida believed a boy was accidentally shot and killed by his father at a Sarasota rifle range. William Brumby was using his weapon at the High Noon Missile Range on Sunday when a mortar shell casing deflected off a nearby truck and landed inside his jacket. A statement from the Sarasota County Attorney \u2019 s office said Brumby failed to remove the shell and deliberately fired the gun at his son, who was standing directly behind him. The boy, Stephen Thomas Brumby, died at a local hospital. The father \u2019 s two other brothers were with him but were not injured.",
        "Hillary Clinton called Donald Johnson to order on Monday evening in probably the most watched \u2014 and yet the weirdest and wildest \u2014 presidential debate in recent history. She demanded authority over his tax returns, his shortage of workers, his temperament as the man with his hand on the nuclear trigger. As he fought and dived with incoherent excuses, she stared at him with thinly veiled amusement. Then, right at the end, like a frosty school principal, she managed to expel the ranting, sniffling, whining schoolboy who had not done his homework.",
        "It is the most famous act of in the history of art, but the original motivation \u2014 love? Jealousy? Hate? \u2014 for Vincent van Gogh \u2019 s surgery to cut off his ear has remained unknown for more than a century. According to a new study of his death in Provence, the gruesome procedure was in part inspired by the news his sister Theo, his most loyal confidant and longtime supporter, was about to marry after a whirlwind event.",
        "Michael Moore, the documentary maker who produced a damning film about the Donald Administration, a month ago, has said he believes the Democratic party \u2019 s future success depends on them embracing populism. Moore, speaking on NBC \u2019 s State of the Union website, said the leadership vacuum that will result from the departures of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama may best be filled by a minority. \u201c Democrats would be worse off if they ran Oprah [ Winfrey ] or Tom Hanks, \u201d says Moore. \u201c Why don \u2019 t we run many people? We have so many of them.",
        "Lisbon \u2019 s 25 span bridge, a naggingly familiar line of red metal stretched between the Tagus and a bright blue Atlantic sky, has long borne a symbolic weight to carry the tonnage of cars and trains that pass over it every day. When it was constructed, 50 years ago, the bridge was named after Portugal \u2019 s dictator, Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar. In 1974, three years after his death, it was rebaptised to mark the day on which the Carnation revolution managed to unshackle the country from almost half a century of authoritarian rule.",
        "Despite forming part of a beaten US team and in a sentiment that will be forever shared, Rory McIlroy has stated a Ryder Cup win for the USA at Hazeltine was a positive hope for the future of the event. The USA saw off Europe by 17 victories to 11, thereby sealing their fourth success in four months and only a second Ryder Cup win in nine. \u201c It is sad obviously, \u201d said the UK No3, who lost by a hole to Chris Reed in the singles on Friday. \u201c But I think it \u2019 s good for us.",
        "The international case ruling that China \u2019 s presence in the South China Sea \u2014 and many of the tactics it has used to assert those claims \u2014 are legitimate presents difficult challenges for all involved. For China, the question is whether to modify its claims, or continue them in direct contravention of international law. The question for the EU, the United States and many other nations, meanwhile, will be how to proceed in a way that supports the resolution and makes it more likely that China will choose to peacefully settle the disputes.",
        "It was a beautiful evening, warm but not too warm. Helena Ayeh, a freelance architect, had stepped out from her apartment on 23rd Street, to buy some wine to go with the dinner she was about to cook. \u201cI was going to make a lovely meal, some fish and asparagus,\u201d she said. \u201cI was really looking forward to it. \u201d Ayeh strolled to a wine store in the West Village, then headed home with a bottle of Burgundy, a bottle of Bordeaux \u201cand a plonk\u201d.",
        "Whatever I shoot represents whatever dream I had the night before. I have suffered from night terrors from the age of four. The things I dream are absolutely terrifying. I know I\u2019m asleep, I know it isn\u2019t real, but I just can\u2019t wake up. When I turned six, these screaming nightmares began to spill over into my waking life. I started confusing what was real and what wasn\u2019t. I would see things that would make me think of my dreams and I\u2019d go into shock.",
        "Polls and punditry predicted a Latino surge would clinch Hillary Clinton\u2019s election but now the question is whether Latinos helped put Donald Trump in the White House. Exit polls suggest 29% voted for the Republican \u2014 a higher margin than Mitt Romney won in 2012 and perhaps enough to have tipped the scales in battleground states. That possibility sent analysts scrambling on Wednesday to plumb the numbers and ponder the psyche of an ethnic minority which Trump was deemed to have insulted and provoked.",
        "North Korean leader Kim supervised a of a ballistic missile and declared it \u201cthe greatest success\u201d that put the country in the \u201cfront rank\u201d of nuclear military powers, official media has reported.

        "Cristiano Ronaldo put his hands on his hips and took a long, lingering look up at the Vicente Calder\u00f3n. He stood there for a while, alone, striking a challenging pose, chest out and steady in front of the south stand. Beyond the netting, a barrier for flying objects, thousands of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid fans raised their middle fingers and their voices. Others just looked stunned. In the middle somewhere, one of them puffed on a cigarette. So this is how it ends.",
        "Tensions ahead of an always charged soccer game this Friday have suddenly been magnified by the election of Donald Trump as America\u2019s 45th president. Trump ran a campaign that openly denigrated immigrants and called for the mass deportation of Mexicans from the United States. His incendiary rhetoric \u2014 Trump called Mexican immigrants, among other things, rapists \u2014 could make for an ugly backdrop to a rivalry that has already had its fair share of nasty incidents.",
        "Joss Whedon has brought out a startlingly video, featuring what the film itself cheerfully calls \u201ca of famous people\u201d including Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Key, Julianne Moore, Stanley Tucci and Martin Sheen \u2014 all talking directly to camera, with the obligatory \u201c \u201d moment. It is hedged with a kind of and irony \u2014 and the way it satirises just this kind of video is actually pretty funny: particularly the moment when an ordinary, person is brought on to lend weight and dignity to the parade of celebrity flibbertigibbets.",
        "Joe Hart has agreed a deal to join Torino on a loan. The goalkeeper is expected in Turin on Tuesday to undergo a medical before completing the move from Manchester City.

        "The founder of Gawker Media, Nick Denton, faces personal bankruptcy after a US judge refused to extend protections shielding him from liabilities in the Hulk Hogan privacy case. The decision represents a victory for Hogan as well billionaire investor Peter Thiel, an early backer and board member of Facebook who helped fund Hogan\u2019s lawsuit following the publication of an article by Gawker about Thiel\u2019s homosexuality. But Denton, a British former journalist, vowed to fight back.",
        "When Donald Trump vowed this week to make childcare more accessible and affordable, it was just the second time during his White House campaign that he\u2019s talked about an issue that affects millions of working Americans with young children. The first came months ago in Iowa, when the eventual Republican nominee touted his own record as a business owner during a candidate QA, telling voters he provided childcare service for his employees. There is no evidence, however, that any such programs exist.",
        "The soundtrack to the Democratic national convention rings familiar in Philadelphia. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was booed at her Florida delegation breakfast on Monday. They booed during the opening prayer. Bernie Sanders was booed by his supporters when he insisted it was time to rally behind Clinton. Even Barack Obama addressed it in Wednesday\u2019s remarks: \u201cDon\u2019t boo, vote!\u201d As the lusty jeers have cascaded down from the stands at the Wells Fargo Center, Philadelphians everywhere have braced for the backlash. We\u2019re used to it.",
        "Earlier this month, Donald Trump used a \u201c \u201d rally in Des Moines, Iowa, to give his supporters further insight into the \u201c \u201d team he intends to build in Washington.

        "\u201cRevel in your faggotry!\u201d This was the commandment given to us at the beginning of Xrysalis: Gathering of Queer People of Color, an event taking place last week in the Redwoods of Mendocino County, about 100 miles north of San Francisco. The weekend had some ground rules: no white or straight people were allowed to watch us partying, dancing or doing drag. We would be, if only briefly, entirely free from the white heterosexual gaze \u2014 a new experience for many of the 50 participants. Instead, Xrysalis was reserved for radical faeries of color.",
        "From Kartik Dhara\u2019s home, the trucks at the top of the garbage mountain look like the toys he sees city children playing with on his rounds of Kolkata. A garbage truck driver in the eastern Indian city, Dhara can\u2019t afford to buy toys for his own children, but he often finds discarded ones where he unloads rubbish every day. \u201cYou can find everything there,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are dead babies, there are truckloads of smuggled chocolates or medicines that the excise department finds. I\u2019ve even found money and gold \u2014 a lot of gold.",
        "Millions of young British men are being denied a vaccine that could protect them from throat cancers in later life. Scientists say the problem is becoming increasingly worrying as rates of human papilloma virus (HPV) \u2014 a common sexually transmitted infection and the prime cause of these cancers \u2014 are now rising exponentially. Researchers want the government to include adolescent boys in the current vaccine programme that immunises girls aged 12 and 13 against HPV before they become sexually active. HPV in women is known to lead to cervical cancers.",
        "The volatility suffered by stock markets in recent days is unlikely to ease in the near future. The day saw a rebound following the sharp declines which came in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, but the City is reluctant to bet too strongly on where markets go from here. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: It would be premature to call the bottom of the market, prices are still adjusting to the world, and it would be foolhardy to rule out further price swings.",
        "Deep antipathy to Hillary Clinton exists within the FBI, multiple bureau sources have told the Guardian, spurring a rapid series of leaks damaging to her campaign just days before the election. Current and former FBI officials, none of whom were willing or cleared to speak on the record, have described a chaotic internal climate that resulted from outrage over director James Comey\u2019s July decision not to recommend an indictment over Clinton\u2019s maintenance of a private email server on which classified information transited. \u201cThe FBI is Trumpland,\u201d said one current agent.",

The duo make a characteristically wobbly and hungover reappearance in heels, champagne flutes in one hand and cigarettes in the other. No nonsense about vaping."
