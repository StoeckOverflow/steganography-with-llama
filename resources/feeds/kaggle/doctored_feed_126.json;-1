        "For all the criticism of Arizona State \u2019 s Draymond Green and his penchant for handling flagrant fouls during these playoffs, Wednesday may have brought the harshest words forth. The critic : Green himself. Saying he shut the Warriors down and that he was a \u201c terrible \u201d Green spoke on how it pained him to be absent for Game 5 of the NBA Finals \u2014 and how he will make amends on Thursday morning in Game 6, when the Warriors play the Cleveland Cavaliers and get another shot at winning what may be their second straight title.",
        "The Football Association has refused to comment on speculation that two England players visited a strip joint on the same night that Wayne Rooney was photographed socialising at the team grounds, with the governing body agreeing to review its policy over reducing \u2019 free time while on active duty. Liverpool \u2019 s Chris Henderson and Adam Lallana were revealed to have travelled to Bournemouth for a day out after being given time off by the English manager, Gareth Southgate, the week after England \u2019 s victory against Scotland in a World Cup qualifier.",
        "The vapour trails of Roger Federer \u2019 s extraordinary comeback against Nikola Cilic were still fresh on Centre Court when Andy Murray fought through the gloaming to survive a careful examination of his resolve by Tsonga for a place in the Wimbledon against Tomas Berdych on Monday. It was by far his toughest match of the year \u2014 rightly so, against the player of the five he has lost \u2014 before he prevailed ( ) in three days and 53 minutes of high pressure.",
        "Barack Obama used his last lecture tour as president to campaign against the rise of divisive politics with the slow ascent of what he described as black nationalism and tribalism, apparently referring to Donald Trump \u2019 s attempt to appoint Stephen Bannon as his personal strategist. In Athens, a city he later hailed as the birthplace of genocide, the outgoing leader spoke of the dangers posed by such developments with the stark reminder that not that long ago Europe had been made into \u201c a bloodbath \u201d because of them.",
        "This week Hulu debuts Doctor, a new medical drama starring Hugh Holden as a brilliant but troubled former neuropsychiatrist who has a gift for figuring out his patients \u2019 problems but can \u2019 t quite diagnose his own. Sounds familiar? Specialty aside, CBS \u2019 s new TV doc Eldon Jones sounds a lot like Dr Gregory Smith, the curmudgeonly genius he played for four seasons on Fox. And Laurie \u2019 s not the only actor trying to recapture past glories this fall.",
        "In 1904, George Bernard Shaw wrote a story about Ireland. He called it John Bull \u2019 s Other Island. With a better title like that, Shaw \u2014 if he were alive today \u2014 might have got himself signed up for a major BBC series. Even in 2016, John Bull already has plenty of other islands and enclaves talking about the world. And, as a presenter, even prancing about the world in his tweed would put even Dan Brown or Lucy Worsley standing. These other island and coastal enclaves rarely impinge on the public consciousness.",
        "Whenever moral correctness goes too far, the others seem to be close by, egging it on and forcing it to go further. Take \u201c mansplaining \u201d. Every week, a Swedish man set up a mansplaining hotline, enabling office staff to report and record instances of mansplaining in the workplace. This being called, it is an mansplaining hotline men and women have free access to its services. A great reminder, by the way, if you are wrong as to what mansplaining means : there is hard mansplaining and fast mansplaining but, basically, mansplaining means mansplaining.",
        "The mobile gaming sensation Pok\u00e9mon Mobile has altered the lives of the more than 20 billion people who \u2019 ve downloaded it over the past week, but it has also damaged the thousands of businesses that find themselves situated near many of the game \u2019 s many hotspots \u2014 both for young and ill. In San Jose \u2014 where a scheduled Pok\u00e9mon Facebook crawl is expected to attract nearly 6, 000 players per week \u2014 local store owners couldn \u2019 t help noticing throngs of people in front of their shop, huddled around their table tossing Pok\u00e9balls around.",
        "Well, that \u2019 s just about it from me for reading. Andy Murray has just taken two sets to move up against Nick Kyrgios, sealing the third set in 26 minutes. You can read that match here with Jacob Steinberg. Thanks for reading, have a good week and don \u2019 t forget to join us again tomorrow. Well, we now know who the winner of will play on tour, because Gasquet has just conceded his match against Tsonga due to a back injury. That \u2019 s true for Gasquet, who has twice been a in SW19 and has been playing some competitive tennis of late.",
        "Storms earlier this week blew down more than a hundred hectares of forests where migrating monarch butterflies spend the winter in central Mexico, killing more than 7 % of the monarchs, according to conservationists. Rain, cold and moist winds from the storms caused the loss of 133 acres ( 54 ha ) of pine and fir trees in the north west of Mexico state, more than four times the area lost to illegal immigration this year. It was the biggest hurricane since the winter of when extremely heavy rainstorms and mudslides caused the loss of 262 acres ( 106 hectares ) of trees.",
        "Two boxes or not two boxes? That is the question. For almost half a century Newcomb \u2019 s problem has been one of the most contentious conundrums in physics, with ramifications in economics, politics and political science. Vast amounts have been reported about it, yet thinkers cannot decide on the right answer. Looking uncharacteristically for the gentle and cerebral lovers of philosophy, here is a debate in which each side is extremely confident they are correct and that the other side is wrong. On which table do you sit? Read the letter and submit your decision below.",
        "The US Government has begun asking American foreign travelers to disclose their social media activities as part of an expanded effort to avoid potential terrorist threats. The request functions as a prompt on the UK Electronic System for Travel Authorization, or Esta, a visa waiver application that foreign visitors are required to review before travelling to the US. The websites include platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Google + Instagram, LinkedIn and YouTube, and additional space for people to input their account logs on those sites.",
        "Facebook effectively tripled its profits in the third quarter of 2016 as the social media marketplace took an even smaller slice of the online news market. The company announced a 59 % increase in advertising revenue on Wednesday. Net revenue for the three months ending 30 September rose to $ 2. 38bn from $ 896m a month earlier. The jump in profits and revenues comes as major publishers are hemorrhaging advertising revenue and announcing cutbacks. News outlets including the Daily Mail, the Guardian, New York Times and Wall Street Journal have all announced layoffs in recent weeks.",
        "Hundreds of people in the UK have demonstrated against the killing of two black men \u2014 one in Minnesota and one in Louisiana \u2014 in the United States. A crowd of about 300 people gathered in Windrush Square in Brixton, south London, bringing traffic to a standstill as they marched to the police station and through neighbouring streets, chanting \u201cblack lives matter\u201d and \u201chands up, don\u2019t shoot\u201d. It was the second show of British support against the US shootings in successive days. There was a mass protest in central London on Friday when hundreds of people marched on Westminster.",
        "Mars reaches its closest approach to Earth for 11 years this evening at 21:35 GMT. The red planet will be just 75 million kilometres away. Mars has been steadily approaching, tripling its apparent diameter as seen through telescopes since January. But don\u2019t be deceived by any internet messages claiming that it will appear larger than the full moon. The moon is just 384 thousand kilometres away Mars will never come that close. A close approach between Earth and Mars, known as opposition, occurs every 2 years and two months.",
        "The United States opens the Concacaf Gold Cup on 8 July at Nashville, Tennessee. It plays four days later at Tampa, Florida, and closes Group B play in the first round on 15 July at Cleveland. The regional body said Monday that defending champion Mexico, seeded in Group C, opens 9 July at San Diego. It plays four days later at Denver and completes group play 16 July at San Antonio. Group A Matches will be 7 July at Harrison, New Jersey, 11 July at Houston and 14 July at Frisco, Texas.",
        "That using terrorist watchlists for gun bans is discriminatory to Muslims and Arabs was a prominent part of the national conversation during the congressional rush to \u201cdo something\u201d after the San Bernardino shooting in December. But Democrats, who usually pride themselves on their stance, made no mention of this grave concern during their supposedly heroic on the House floor this week, leaving a community already suffering from and sentiment wondering why. The \u201cNo Buy\u201d bill members demanded to vote on is a problem in and of itself.",
        "Hundreds of animals, including baby squirrels and raccoons, are being tended to in wildlife centers in the wake of Hurricane Hermine\u2019s destructive journey along the east coast. Many animals were shaken from trees during the hurricane, which hit Florida before weakening to a tropical storm as it moved northward to Virginia and New Jersey over Labor Day weekend. St Francis Wildlife in Quincy, Florida, reported more than 260 squirrel patients, many of them orphaned, after high winds knocked them from trees.",
        "I\u2019m wondering, is it OK, hypothetically, for a child to lick the sole of her shoe? What about, just for argument\u2019s sake, eating a cigarette end in a park? And where, as a general rule, do we stand on licking sticks? In other words, sometimes I feel there isn\u2019t enough hand sanitiser in the world to keep a small child clean. All these questions go through my mind as I prepare to speak with microbiologists Arrieta and Brett Finlay, whose book for parents, Let Them Eat Dirt, has turned my world on its head.",
        "One of the easiest ways of measuring your personality is simply to ask which kinds of TV, films, and books and magazines do you enjoy. Do you prefer: a) Daytime talk shows, romance, cooking and religionb) Arts and humanities, classics, foreign films and poetryc) Horror, cult films and erotic novelsd) Action and adventure, thrillers, films and spy storiese) News, documentaries and nonfiction, Your answer reveals which of the five personality types you are.",
        "Despite the odds stacked against his underdog side, Croatia captain Zeljko Krajan was brimming with confidence on Sunday morning before the reverse singles matches in the Davis Cup tie against United States. And Marin Cilic and Borna Coric backed up their captain\u2019s belief in a stirring rally, winning matches to give Croatia a comeback victory at the Tualatin Hills hard courts. \u201cToday, I knew they were going to bring the quality,\u201d Krajan said. Cilic got the comeback started, beating John Isner ( ) . Coric then topped Jack Sock .",
        "Charles Manson made many grand predictions in the 60s to his damaged followers about his future, but he never foresaw that he would waste away pathetically, a broken old man in prison. Rather, he said he would be a rock star \u2014 \u201cbigger than the Beatles\u201d he promised. Failing that, or perhaps as well as that, he would be the triumphant Aryan leader in a global race revolution. But what he really wanted, more than anything, was to be famous. In that pursuit, if nothing else, he wholly succeeded.",
        "A tearful Ryan Lochte has said sorry to his US swimming his family and the people of Brazil for a \u201cstupid mistake\u201d at a Rio gas station that overshadowed the final week of the Olympic Games. The gold medallist also tried to explain why he made up the story of the robbery that never was. \u201cI was intoxicated,\u201d Lochte said. \u201cI was immature, and I made a stupid mistake. I\u2019m human, and I\u2019m just really sorry.",
        "A woman who worked as a radio operator at Auschwitz has been ruled unfit to stand trial on charges that she was an accessory to the murder of 260, 000 at the Nazi death camp in Poland. A court in Kiel, northern Germany, said on Friday that the woman, identified only as Helma M, was almost blind and deaf, and that a serious illness this year had left her physically, mentally and emotionally unfit to be put on trial.",
        "A couple of weeks ago, Taylor Mac spent the evening rehearsing a number from A History of Popular Music at St Ann\u2019s Warehouse in Brooklyn. An ecstatic and skeptical exploration of American song, Mac\u2019s project is divided into eight concerts that will eventually be scrunched together into one cathexis. The number at hand was Tiptoe Through the Tulips and Mac was rehearsing an epic between 12 Charles Dickenses and 12 tapping Tiny Tims. As none of the strummers or hoofers had been called to rehearsal, Mac was alone onstage. It didn\u2019t seem that way.",
        "The Baton Rouge Metro Council approved a settlement on Tuesday paying activist DeRay Mckesson and other protesters arrested during summer demonstrations over the shooting death of Alton Sterling. The Advocate reports that under the terms of the deal, the city government, the Louisiana state police, the East Baton Rouge sheriff\u2019s office and the district attorney\u2019s office will pay no more than $25, 000 each for a total of about $100, 000. Mckesson was among nearly 200 protesters arrested after Sterling, a black man, was shot on 5 July during a struggle with two white police officers.",
        "The insanely popular Pok\u00e9mon Go is collecting users\u2019 data and sharing it with anonymous third parties, Senator Al Franken of Minnesota said in a letter to the company\u2019s CEO on Tuesday. The lawmaker wrote a letter to Niantic Inc\u2019s John Hanke on Tuesday with a list of demands for further information regarding the app\u2019s privacy settings. \u201cI am concerned about the extent to which Niantic may be unnecessarily collecting, using, and sharing a wide range of users\u2019 personal information without their appropriate consent,\u201d he wrote.",
        "Matt Damon once said the only superhero he would ever consider playing was Marvel\u2019s Daredevil, and only if Christopher Nolan agreed to direct. But that was before best pal Ben Affleck was handed the keys to the Batmobile. Speaking at the UK premiere of Jason Bourne, Damon revealed he would consider pulling on the spandex provided Affleck made the offer, and didn\u2019t go snagging the best role for himself. Which got us thinking about how the would fit into the DC expanded universe if his friend ever makes the call.",
        "In the Washington of 2016, even when the policy can be bipartisan, the politics cannot. And in that sense, this year shows little sign of ending on Dec. 31. When President Obama moved to sanction Russia over its alleged interference in the U. S. election just concluded, some Republicans who had long called for similar or more severe measures could scarcely bring themselves to approve.",
        "Donald Trump has used Twitter \u2014 his preferred means of communication \u2014 to weigh in on a swath of foreign policy issues over the past few weeks. His comments give a glimpse into how his incoming administration will deal with pressing foreign matters \u2014 but also highlight how reactionary comments on social media can immediately spur international concern and attention. And his staff has indicated that taking to Twitter to air his concerns or, often, grievances, won\u2019t end once he enters the Oval Office. On Wednesday, Trump blasted the U. S.\u2019s abstention from the U. N."
