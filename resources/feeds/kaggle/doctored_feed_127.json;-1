        "Donald Trump is unabashedly praising Russian president Vladimir Putin, a year after outgoing President Putin issued tough measures against the country in response to perceived cyberattacks intended to influence the U. S. elections. In a tweet Friday night, Trump responded to Obama \u2019 s decision not to expel U.

S. sanctions, as his prime minister had suggested earlier Friday. Instead, he says he will decide how to move forward depending on the actions of Donald Trump \u2019 s administration. Russia took to Twitter on Sunday afternoon to praise Russia \u2019 s decision, calling it a \u201d smart move. \u201d On Thursday, the White House announced sanctions against Russia in response to what it described \u201d a campaign of operations \u201d against the U.

        "I did not want to take yoga class. I loved those beatific instructors. I worried that the girls in the class could end up like origami and I \u2019 d fold up like a bread stick. I understood the need for stretchy clothes but not for total anatomical disclosure. But my hip bones hurt and so did my shoulders, and my lower back hurt way more than my lower back and my neck would. not. shut. up.

        "I was standing by the service exit, debating whether to get a snack, when a big man with a round nose approached me. I focused harder to decipher his words. In a thick accent, he asked me to help him carry his suitcase. As we walked to baggage claim, I learned his name : Edward Murinzi. This was his very first American trip. A refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo, he \u2019 d just agreed to begin his American journey.",

No one was farming there at the time, and that \u2019 s what had led Fisher to the place. He was looking for farmland. \u201d I remember getting out [ to the fallow fields ] at some point, \u201d Fisher recalls. \u201d And in the moonlight \u2014 it was all snowy \u2014 it was like a blank canvas. \u201d On that blank canvas, Fisher \u2019 s son painted a picture of what might be there alongside the South Atlantic.",
        "For years now, some of the biggest, wildest, most moving or revealing things we \u2019 ve been telling ourselves have come not from games, movies or TV, but from computer games. So we \u2019 re running an annual series, Reading The Bible, in which we take a look at some of these things from a literary perspective. I played the game through the first book in something like a deep state of awe and shock. Enraptured is, I think, the word that truly describes it.",

A portion of the produce in supermarkets across the state was grown with Colorado state water. But with climate changes, and severe drought, the River is reaching a crisis level, and communities at each end of it are reacting very quickly. Just outside Boulder, Colo.

When he was growing up in Georgia, he questioned the standard scales he was taught in school. \u201dI played by ear and I invented my own chords,\u201d he says. In Western music, we\u2019re taught that there are set notes in scales, but there is actually an infinite number of pitches in between those notes.

Divestiture is good for you, good for America!\u201d The controversy was : (1) The OGE doesn\u2019t typically air its positions publicly, advising White House transition teams behind the scenes. (2) Trump hadn\u2019t promised the total divestitures of business interests implied by the tweets.

The music grows decades later, rung out in steel vibration and wrung out from tradition. In 2016, there was an incredible bounty of guitar music across Americana, jazz, ambient, psychedelic, experimental music and what Fahey labeled American Primitive. For sake of focus, these 10 unranked records (and a few honorable mentions) were all primarily made by one person with the guitar as the primary instrument.",

        "From West Virginia to Wyoming, coal country overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump and his message that he will bring coal jobs back. Now, those same voters are eyeing his incoming administration closely, careful to see if he will keep his promises to revive the coal industry and get miners back to work. These hopes have become increasingly desperate as the industry has floundered. U. S. coal production in 2016 is projected to be at its lowest level since 1978, and over the past few years, the country has lost about 30, 000 coal jobs.",

        "Much has been said about the physical and psychological injuries of war, like traumatic brain injury or stress disorder. But what we talk about less is how these conditions affect the sexual relationships of service members after they return from combat. Since 2000, service members who were deployed received at least 138, 000 diagnoses of PTSD. More than 350, 000 have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury since 2000. Evidence suggests the numbers are actually higher because many don\u2019t seek treatment. These conditions cause their own sexual side effects, such as emotional numbness, loss of libido and erectile dysfunction.",
