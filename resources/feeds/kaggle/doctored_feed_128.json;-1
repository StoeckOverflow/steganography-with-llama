And among the frittatas, French toast, and grits, there will be definitely Josh McFadden \u2019 s own favorite : pasta carbonara. McFadden, who has ordered carbonara at New York Italian restaurants, fell in love with it for breakfast while living at the Art Academy in Rome. A dish of spaghetti doesn \u2019 t look anything like your local greasy spoon \u2019 s finest, but McFadden says the dish is a whole lot more familiar than you might think.",
        "U. S. District Court Chief Judge John Roberts highlights the work of federal district judges in his report on the federal judiciary, avoiding any kind of politics in regards to the country \u2019 s judicial system.

        "When Octavia Spencer Smith read the script for Moving Figures \u2014 based on a book about the black American women who did the design for our early space stations \u2014 she thought it was fiction because it sounded too good to be true. Her work reveals how conditioned we are to remember that only white men make notable contributions to science, technology, engineering and business \u2014 and how important it is that we celebrate accomplishments of the women who do. Big screen movies based on historical stories are an excellent opportunity to do this.",

Freddie Bitsoie is one of those chefs, working to bring back indigenous foods from decades ago, and adapting them for today \u2019 s palate so one can learn not just about their cuisines, but their cultures too.

        "It \u2019 s that time of day again, when I atone for my failure to make Top 10 lists by simply publishing a collection of 50 of the many good things I read, seen or heard in 2016. ( Here \u2019 s last day \u2019 s list, for reference. ) Key caveats : I don \u2019 t watch everything! I am relying on many things. That \u2019 s just the way the world is. So if something you hate isn \u2019 t here, it is not a rebuke. And : these are cultural \u2014 mostly \u2014 things. These are not the best things in the universe.",
        "For those of us at home, 2016 was of big news importance, so much so, it sometimes meant the horrors in the headlines would suddenly stop \u2014 the migrant workers, police shootings, terrorist attacks, and on and on.

        "Though many of us lamented the saga of this decade \u2019 s U. S. presidential elections, the news was too momentous to tune out. Meanwhile, many of the year \u2019 s best stories on NPR. org were all about politics.

This past November, Democrats held their congressional seats to a minimum, helped by an already strong GOP wave like Trump.

        "Democrats might have lost the House and the Senate over the past eight years, but they always had one advantage : President Barack Obama \u2014 and his veto pen \u2014 in the entire House. That won \u2019 t be the case next year, when Republicans console themselves with all the power in Washington for the first time since 2006.

        "There \u2019 s more methane gas in the atmosphere than there used to be, by every single measure. The Obama Administration has been trying to stem the impact of this powerful greenhouse gas, but the incoming Trump administration appears bent on taking the government \u2019 s hands off methane. The water comes from agriculture, especially flooded agricultural products like rice crops, as well as from the digestive tracts of fish.

That may sound odd, but this wasn\u2019t just any subway or any old station, it was the stuff of urban legend: the Second Avenue subway line.
