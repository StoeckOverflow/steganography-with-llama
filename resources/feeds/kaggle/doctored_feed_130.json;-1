        "People dream of black holes as giant vacuum cleaners, sucking in everything in reach, from light to darkness to Matthew McConaughey in the movie Interstellar. But, in real life, black holes don \u2019 t consume everything that they live in. \u201d They \u2019 re actually pretty picky eaters, \u201d said Jedidah Isler, an astrophysicist at Vanderbilt University. She spends most days chipping away at one of the universe \u2019 s biggest problems : How do the huge, overactive black holes, known as quasars, work? \u201d They are billions of times the mass of our own sun, \u201d she says.",

        "Vocalist Xenia Rubinos ended 2016 with a recognition : Her album Black Terry Cat was singled out in lists by Apple Music, The New York Times and Rolling Stone. That kind of recognition is a huge deal for an independent woman with a artistic vision. Mr. Latino first shared that vision back in 2012, when we learned a track from Rubinos \u2019 first album, Magic Trix. After we first heard Black Terry cat earlier this year, we invited her and her band into our office for a mesmerizing Arts Desk concert that only hints at the potential of her live show.",
        "Imagine being able to collect the DNA of a living ancestor who \u2019 s been dead for tens of thousands of years from the bones on the floor of a cave. Sounds fantastic, but scientists in America think they may be able to do just that. If they \u2019 re successful, it could open a new door into identifying the extinct relatives of humanity. Most ancient DNA is made from bones or teeth. Professor Meyer of the Max Planck Centre for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig said you don \u2019 t need very much of the evidence less than a thousandth of an ounce will do.",

        "\u201d Dogs are faster than human beings, \u201d wrote Emily Dickinson, \u201d because they kiss but don \u2019 t tell. \u201d That sentiment calls to mind when considering Michael Bitto \u2019 s debut novel, which showcases a dazzling, gabby and easily doomed collection of intelligent human beings.

        "To what lengths would you go to stifle the thunderous snorts and growls of a spouse or two, just so you can get a good night \u2019 s sleep? Dozens of devices crowd the market, ranging from fairly absurd to moderately torturous. \u201d Some of them are more exciting than others, \u201d says Prof. Kim Hutchison, associate professor of sleep medicine in the Department of neurology at Oregon Health and Sciences University in Portland, Ore.

        "Even though most of the protesters fighting the Alaska Access Pipeline in North Dakota have left, hundreds still remain here atop what is essentially a sheet of ice. Another group of campers say there \u2019 s a protest taking hold at Phoenix, which was once overrun by thousands who felt a sense of excitement about the future.

        "The Republican Party has embraced Donald Trump\u2019s positions on immigration, trade, the deficit and conflicts of interest, but when it comes to Russia, Trump and his party are not even close to being on the same page. Trump has repeatedly and consistently expressed admiration for Vladimir Putin and has refused to accept intelligence community findings that Russia hacked Democratic Party emails during the campaign. That puts him at odds with almost every other Republican in Washington, D. C. On Wednesday, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told CNN he is mystified by Trump\u2019s feelings toward Russia.",

        "Donald Trump has suggested he may give his daughter and some roles in his new administration, but a 1967 law makes doing so a lot more complicated. The law bars presidents from hiring relatives to Cabinet or agency jobs, although a federal judge has ruled that it doesn\u2019t apply to White House staff jobs. Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, have played key roles in Trump\u2019s campaign and his transition team and reportedly are preparing to move to a house in the Kalorama section of Washington, D.

        "Just before dawn Thursday, at Tokyo\u2019s historic Tsukiji market, a familiar face walked away with the biggest fish in town. Kiyoshi Kimura won the first auction of the year at the market, just as he has for six years running. And to the winner go the spoils: a Pacific bluefin tuna, which ultimately cost Kimura 74. 2 million yen \u2014 or about $632, 000. That comes out to more than $1, 300 a pound for Kimura, whose Kimura Corp. owns a restaurant chain called Sushi Zanmai.

        "Unexplained, short radio bursts from outer space have puzzled scientists since they were first detected nearly a decade ago. The elusive flashes \u2014 known as fast radio bursts, or FRBs \u2014 are extremely powerful and last only a few milliseconds. The way their frequencies are dispersed suggests they traveled from far outside our galaxy. About 18 have been detected to date. They\u2019ve been called the \u201dmost perplexing mystery in astronomy.\u201d Scientists are still grappling with why these bursts happen.",
        "There\u2019s a new narrative solidifying in Washington: Donald Trump distrusts the U. S. intelligence community because it\u2019s been sounding the alarm on Russia\u2019s interference in the November election. In turn, this feeds a growing sense of dread among U. S. intelligence professionals that the and his inner circle will ignore or undermine the intelligence community at every opportunity. The intelligence community certainly has reason to be concerned. Trump\u2019s goal to slash and restructure the CIA and Office of the Director of National Intelligence was reported by the Wall Street Journal Wednesday, the same day the raised doubts about U.",
        "Donald Trump continues to dispute the consensus of U. S. intelligence agencies that Russia used computer hacking to interfere in the 2016 elections. He does so even though other Republican leaders and analysts perceive a serious cyberattack that demands retaliation. If he persists in this posture, Trump may wish to rely on the precedent of previous presidents who entered the White House at odds with their own parties over a major issue in foreign relations. But can he find one? That\u2019s a tough question.",
        "The halls of the Kiambu County Hospital just outside Nairobi are empty. This is normally a bustling place but on Thursday entire wings are closed. Only in the emergency room are there a scattering of patients. Moms with babies sit languidly on metal chairs. Men with broken bones and some with serious injuries are just hoping to be treated. But they probably won\u2019t be seen by doctors. A doctor\u2019s strike that began last month in Kenya has now entered its second month.",
        "The vaquita is a small porpoise found only in the northern Gulf of California, in Mexico. Today, the species is critically endangered, with less than 60 animals left in the wild, thanks to fishing nets to catch fish and shrimp for sale in Mexico and America. The animal is an accidental victim of the fishing industry, as are many other marine mammals. But a new rule that takes effect this week seeks to protect marine mammals from becoming bycatch. The rule requires foreign fisheries exporting seafood to the U. S.",

        "A comparison of kid brains and grownup brains may explain why our ability to recognize faces keeps getting better until about age 30. Brain scans of 25 adults and 22 children showed that an area devoted to facial recognition keeps growing long after adolescence, researchers report in the journal Science. The area didn\u2019t acquire more neurons, says Jesse Gomez, a graduate student in neurosciences at Stanford University and the study\u2019s lead author. Instead the brain region became more densely populated with the structures that connect and support neurons.",
        "Director Damien Chazelle\u2019s La La Land is an unapologetic musical that hearkens back to Hollywood\u2019s glory days of song and dance. The passion and grandeur of the musical numbers might make you believe that Chazelle had always imagined himself working in the genre, but he tells Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross that\u2019s not the case. \u201dIt wasn\u2019t until I actually started making experimental films and, ironically, documentaries in college that I think my eyes got or awakened, to . .. old classic Hollywood musicals,\u201d Chazelle says.",

        "On a cold night in January nine years ago, Barack Obama won the Iowa caucuses. That first big step on the young senator\u2019s unlikely path to the White House was fueled by an army of campaign volunteers, which Obama later called one of his proudest legacies. \u201dThat\u2019s what America needs right now,\u201d Obama told campaign workers a year later, after he was sworn in as president. \u201dActive citizens like you, who are willing to turn towards each other, talk to people you\u2019ve never met, and say, \u2019C\u2019mon, let\u2019s go do this."
