        "Many transgender people in the U. S. are reluctant to change their designated positions on government documents before President Trump takes office. They worry the next administration may take that policy away. There \u2019 s no indication so far that this is a priority for Trump.

Gradually, the outline of a robe, tassels and hands of an old Chinese woman begin to emerge from a rough piece of ivory in front of him in his makeshift workshop. Li believes nothing looks as delicate, nothing can be carved as intricately or expressively as glass. Wood and jade are too brittle. \u201d Whether I \u2019 m carving animal or human either, I try to express their needs, \u201d he says.",

        "For the first time in Japanese history three women of different political persuasions are in positions that could be throwing stones to the prime minister \u2019 s office. It \u2019 s especially important in Japan, where women \u2019 s labor force participation remains among the lowest economically developed nations, and leadership roles are. \u201d Women have not often been coached or mentored or encouraged to take on leadership roles, \u201d Stanford University diplomacy coach Nancy Snow explains.",

        "Philosophy isn\u2019t natural science, that much is certain. But its relation to the sciences has been fraught \u2014 at least since science broke off from philosophy and became its own family of disciplines back in the 17th century. The very features of natural science that are markers of its success \u2014 specialization, experiment, mathematical tools, progress \u2014 are absent, or take a very different form, in philosophy. My own view is that philosophical problems are not empirical or scientific ones, but that they live cheek by jowl with them.",

        "So now we know: This is how it\u2019s going to be after Inauguration Day, too. When coverage falls afoul of Donald Trump, the will feed the media itself into the news grinder.

        "Charts can seem dull. But not to data scientist Tariq Khokhar at the World Bank. When he looked through a year\u2019s worth of charts, graphs, maps and more, he was excited by the numbers. For example, although the world\u2019s population has increased by 2 billion people since 1990, there are 1. 1 billion fewer people living in extreme poverty, under $1. 90 a day (highlighted in blue in the chart below). \u201dI\u2019m amazed at the progress,\u201d Khokhar says.",
