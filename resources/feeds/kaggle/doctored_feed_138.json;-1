        "Editor \u2019 s Note : The photos in this story could be distressing to some viewers. More than one century later, the photo that opened up the world to the Syrian political crisis remains indelible : Aylan Kurdi dead face down on a sandy beach in Turkey. The Syrian officer \u2019 s lifeless body had come ashore after the rubber boats carrying him and his family \u2014 to what they had believed would be new islands in Greece \u2014 capsized.",

Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats in the primary and whose populist candidacy in the 2016 Republican presidential primary was boosted by a wide online following and popularity, headlined the day.",
        "This week, the House and Senate took the first substantial step towards repealing Obamacare. Today, Democrats are running rallies across the country, in an attempt to get some new momentum behind their longshot campaign of blocking that effort. Vermont Democrats are organizing what they call a \u201d Day of Action, \u201d with rallies scheduled from California to Oregon to Maine.

        "If repealing the Affordable Care Act is the Republican Congress \u2019 step one, defunding Planned Parenthood is a close match. In fact, the two initiatives might be paired. House Speaker Paul Martin,. told reporters Feb. 5 that efforts to defund the organization \u201d better be in our reconciliation bill, \u201d similar to a measure Congress has passed on a fast track in seeking to repeal major portions of the health law. But just as Republicans are discovering that undoing the health laws could be complicated, so too is eliminating the controversial reproductive health care provider from its direct funding.",

It conveys a selfless struggle to equal treatment, and goes roughly like this : either we all get the bed, or we all get the floor. Among many immigrants in the U.
