The freed men were not identified by name or ethnicity, though the Oman Maritime Agency, citing the UK \u2019 s Foreign Ministry, indicated that the 10 had arrived in the country on assignment for \u201d temporary residence. \u201d According to Monday \u2019 s announcement, Yemen had taken in 20 Guantanamo detainees over the past three years, and all of them were from Oman \u2019 s capital, Yemen.

A lot of people call up children \u2019 s names or even \u2019 names, but Deffler is a cognitive researcher at Rollins College, in Hyde Park, Fla. and she wanted to find out why it happens.

But a recent poll lends him another, less attractive superlative: the lowest favorability rating of any incoming president in at least 40 years. That\u2019s what a new ABC Post poll shows, with only 40 percent of Americans currently viewing Trump favorably and 54 percent unfavorably. That\u2019s the lowest favorability for any incoming president since at least Jimmy Carter in 1977 in that poll.",

        "More than 30 years ago, Congress overwhelmingly passed a landmark health bill aimed at motivating pharmaceutical companies to develop new drugs for people whose rare diseases had been ignored. By the drugmakers\u2019 calculations, the markets for such diseases weren\u2019t big enough to bother with. But lucrative financial incentives created by the Orphan Drug Act signed into law by President Reagan in 1983 succeeded far beyond anyone\u2019s expectations.

The numbers were startling: In the 2016 report, Oxfam said the world\u2019s richest 62 people owned as much wealth as the poorest 3. 6 billion. The numbers were also wrong, Oxfam announced Monday. Better data show that last year\u2019s report should have said that just nine billionaires possessed as much wealth as the poorest half of the planet in 2016. And this year, Oxfam says, you only need eight megarich men to balance the scales with the accumulated wealth of 3. 6 billion people.",
        "\u201dPeople keep asking me, how close are we to going off the cliff,\u201d says Dr. James Johnson, professor of infectious diseases medicine at the University of Minnesota. The cliffside free fall he is talking about is the day that bacteria will be able to outfox the world\u2019s entire arsenal of antibiotics. Common infections would then become untreatable. Here\u2019s Johnson\u2019s answer: \u201dCome on people. We\u2019re off the cliff. It\u2019s already happening. People are dying. It\u2019s right here, right now.

        "Most Broadway musicals that close after 16 performances barely prompt memories, let alone documentaries. But in 1981, the Stephen Furth opus, Merrily We Roll Along, rolled along so bizarrely, it became the stuff of Broadway legend, worthy of a 2017 . Best Worst Thing That Ever Could Have Happened is a theatrically captivating documentary in which a director looks sideways at a musical that goes backwards. In the opening moments of the film, director Lonny Price is rummaging around in a cardboard box filled with film from an special about Merrily.",
        "When Morning Edition host David Greene spoke to DJ Khaled recently, there was simply too much good stuff to fit all of it on the radio. Fortunately, the show passed along to us an extended version of the interview, which opens with David explaining why this was the second time they set up an interview with the musician, producer and social media . You should listen to the whole thing for yourself, because none of this sounds as intriguing in print as it does when DJ Khaled says it, but here are a few of the things you\u2019ll hear.",

For some, the verb choice conjures an image of the giant hands of a powerful and magnanimous government carefully extracting villagers from their rundown homes and then delicately depositing them inside new urban apartments with modern amenities. Others, though, don\u2019t give the expression much thought.",

        "In a presidential campaign marked by harsh rhetoric, Donald Trump directed some of his strongest words toward China. He called the Chinese government a currency manipulator, threatened to impose tariffs on goods imported from one of America\u2019s leading trade partners and repeatedly vowed to get tough on China. Now, as Trump is sounding the same notes. He caused a veritable earthquake in U. S. relations just by taking a call from Taiwan\u2019s President Tsai . This challenged the bedrock of U. S. relations, the \u201dOne China\u201d policy, under which the U. S.",
        "The first time I tasted chamoy was in the Mexican border town of Eagle Pass, Texas. At a street cart vendor, chamoy apples sat alongside elotes and tamales. The tart Granny Smith was rolled in a thick paste that was sweet, salty, spicy and sour all at once. As I took the first bite, I thought: \u201dThere is no way this is gonna work.\u201d But it did, and after that, the mere thought of chamoy made me salivate like a Pavlovian dog. I had to learn more about it. In Mexico, chamoy comes in many forms.",
