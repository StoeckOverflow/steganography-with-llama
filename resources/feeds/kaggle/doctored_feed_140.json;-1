        "There \u2019 s the heroic, tender care that saves patients from crises. And then there \u2019 s the incremental medical attention that hospitals provide for weeks, days, years, even months in the attempt to heal chronic conditions. As a surgeon, The New Yorker \u2019 s Atul Gawande practices the latest type of medicine.

It was a record for the science of. In this research, researchers inch ever closer to \u2014 but never reached \u2014 the state of absolute equilibrium temperature. It \u2019 s a science that has some very applications ( pun very much intended ) uses including gravity wave detectors for \u201d hearing \u201d distant black hole mergers.

        "The long history of the pharmaceutical industry seems to pervade practically every profession of medicine, reaching those who seek guidelines that shape best \u2019 practices, patient interest organizations, letter writing to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and even oncologists on occasion, according to a series of articles on money and influence every Tuesday in JAMA Internal Medicine. The findings of the papers constitute further evidence showing how issues of interest help impact health care, a field ProPublica has explored through its Dollars for Docs series since 2010.",

The aircraft vanished from radar on May 8, 2014, with 239 people on board. Since then, nothing has been seen of the plane except for pieces of ice that floated far from the crash focus.

As consistent as it is going, Spoon never fails to mark its mark \u2014 delivered well, and with hooks for days. On October 17, Spoon returns with its ninth song, Hot Thoughts \u2014 and if the title track is any indication, that impeccably chosen palette \u2019 s worth a few new colors.",

        "As long as there has been a commercial industry, there have been attempts \u2014 both overt and clandestine \u2014 to distribute hits. You can look as far back as the early 20th Century, when musicians known as \u201d song pluggers \u201d were paid to promote country music.

        "The first results from a major project to measure the reliability of cancer research have highlighted a big problem: Labs trying to repeat published experiments often can\u2019t. That\u2019s not to say that the original studies are wrong. But the results of a review published Thursday, in the journal eLife, are a sobering reminder that science often fails at one of its most basic requirements \u2014 an experiment in one lab ought to be reproducible in another one.

At least, it was a look, back in the bad old days of the benighted \u201990s, when superhero fashion, like skiing, skateboarding, makeovers and underarm deodorant, got extreeeeeme.
