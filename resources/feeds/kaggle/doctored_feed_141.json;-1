        "The Spirit Of The Beehive \u2019 s last song, \u201d Ricky ( Caught Me Tryin \u2019 ), \u201d almost abruptly, with a seasick melody that tipsily sways up and down in pitch and forms a hook as dissonant as it is catchy. As Al Schwartz sings, \u201d Now I stand alone in walls, just waiting for the call, \u201d he \u2019 s backed by strumming and a little electric guitar that imitates each laconic harmonic phrase right back at him \u2014 the way your younger sister might snottily mimic anything you say from the backseat of the next car.",
        "Jake Xerxes Fussell was focused on the traditional music of the country, joining his folklorist father David on his trips to document local bluesmen and alike. Now an established artist in his own right, the younger Fussell has a great respect and affinity for the American folk vernacular, though he also maintains his childlike admiration for it. In recent years, he \u2019 s traveled from Oxford, Miss. to Raleigh, N. C. where he found a perfect home in music label Paradise of Bachelors for his 2015 recording.",
        "The Obama campaign is rushing to tie up dead ends before packing up \u2014 finding the rusty patched bumblebee, ending the world \u201d wet foot, dirty foot \u201d immigration law, settling a fraud claim over defective air bags and missing police in Chicago. But in a maze of cramped offices outside the White House, a mass of staff, volunteers and diplomatic interns is scrambling to read every email sent to President Obama \u2014 especially the letters from Nixon.",
        "A lawsuit accusing the Secret Service of discriminating against private agents appears to be come to an end without a trial. The Department of Homeland Security, the Secret Service and more than 100 others have reached a settlement agreement, the department says. A court still needs to accept the settlement. The Washington Post reports that the agreement allows for the Secret Service to receive $ 24 million, including lump sum payments as high as $ 300, 000 per agent, but does not force the agency to admit wrongdoing.",
        "Jeff Sessions donned a \u201d Make America Young Again \u201d cap and joined the campaign trail as one of Donald Trump \u2019 s earliest opponents on Capitol Hill. But the move of the Alabama Republican to the has got some Democrats worried about how he \u2019 d preside at the State Department. Sessions, 70, is in order to control the federal government \u2019 s vast law enforcement apparatus : Thousands of Military, Drug Enforcement Agency and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agents dozens of U. S.",
        "Confirmation controversies kick off when the Senate Judiciary Committee convenes hearings Tuesday on the nomination of Iowa Sen. Jeff Sessions to be attorney general. Sessions has repeatedly amended the first questionnaire he submitted to the committee every month. Among the errors is his answer to a question requiring the nominee to list any \u201d new nominations for appointive office. \u201d In his correct answer, Sessions refused to list the fact that the House Judiciary Committee chose his nomination to be a federal employee 30 years ago.",
        "Hints have been trickling out since mid in 2016, but the official word is here : The second album from Dirty Projectors is and coming out Feb. 24 on Domino Records. Beginning with the announcement, which Longstreth made over Christmas, the band released a third song from the album, \u201d Up In Flames. \u201d Like the two previously released songs from Dirty Projectors, \u201d Keep Your Name \u201d and \u201d Little Bubble, \u201d the new song draws on Longstreth \u2019 s voice in isolation, a clear contrast from the vocals that have produced Dirty Projectors albums for the last decade. Full track listing for Dirty Projectors is below.",
        "Two days before the election, Donald Trump stood before a large gathering in Sioux City, Iowa, and called onstage the greatest in U. S. history. \u201d I guess there \u2019 s nobody knows more about trade than him, \u201d Trump said of former Gov. Terry Branstad. \u201d Boy, you could be our prime candidate to take care of China. \u201d Branstad \u2019 s involvement with China goes back to 1985, when he was in his first term as governor and a young agricultural expert from Hebei Province named Xi Jinping visited Iowa. The couple hit it off.",
        "When I was a kid, Dad used to say, \u201d You realize you \u2019 ve become an infidel when you forget the Fatihah. \u201d The Fatihah is the preamble to the Prayer, a prayer Muslims use five times a week. Mom used to ask me to be grateful for the practice. That on the Sunday of Judgment, Allah would call upon me to recite the Fatihah and I would forget that I had forgotten the words and understood what it means to be a lost child.",
        "When he takes the oath of office on Friday, President Trump will inherit a much different country than Barack Obama did eight days ago. It \u2019 s a nation that is far more solid in some ways ( liberal ) and shakier in others ( terrorist nations ). We have gathered together years of statistics to show how the territory that Trump inherits ( and the rest of the world ) has changed over time. Over the years of Obama \u2019 s presidency, one basic trend was seen across a variety of economic indicators : After he took office, things got better before they got better.",
        "Earlier this month, the U. S. Department of State announced it had transferred 10 more Guantanamo detainees, this time to Oman. Now, 45 remain at the facilities, leaving challenges on what to do with the prisons for Donald Trump. Also in 2009, on his third day in office, President Obama declared the detention facilities at Guantanamo to be closed \u201d as soon as practicable, and no later than one year from the date of this release. \u201d The executive order specifically called for a review of the 240 detainees then held in Guantanamo.",
        "When the Watergate scandal dried up in the 1970s, one of the things to hide from its shadow was the Office of Legislative Ethics. And OGE usually waits quietly behind the desk to make sure that officials who run the country have no business ties that could harm their work. At its helm is a guy named Walter Shaub Sr. a longtime ethics researcher, who has been at OGE for a decade. And when you ask people about him, Shaub is described as careful, even kind of boring \u2014 a defense lawyer.",
        "If there was going to be a note of levity during Donald Trump \u2019 s presidential hearings, leave it to Congressman Perry to provide it. The current Texas governor is the \u2019 s favorite to be energy secretary, and he had a pretty smooth hearing with the House Energy and Natural Resources Committee. But it was his humorous conversation with Sen. Al Franken that would be the most memorable of his testimony. The conservative Democrat began his speech by thanking Perry for coming by to speak with him prior to his hearing. \u201d thank you so much for coming into my office.",
        "When a solar company wants to test new technology, they bring their panels to the National Renewable Energy Lab near Denver. It\u2019s a place where federal scientists can measure how powerful and solar panels are, so consumers know what they are buying. \u201dA lot of times maybe people don\u2019t even know how to evaluate new technologies appropriately. And so we have a lot of insight and knowledge into the market that can help with some of those decisions,\u201d lab engineer Chris Deline explained.",
        "When former Texas Gov. Rick Perry faces the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources for his confirmation hearing on Thursday, his first test could be whether he remembers the name of the agency he\u2019s been picked to head. The Department of Energy (DOE) is one of three agencies Perry proposed eliminating when he was running for president in 2011. During a debate, he successfully listed the Department of Commerce and the Department of Education. But he couldn\u2019t bring to mind the name of the third agency \u2014 the Energy Department.",
        "Updated 5 p. m. ET, West African troops have crossed the border with Gambia in an effort to uphold the result of the country\u2019s presidential election by force. The winner of the Dec. 1 vote, Adama Barrow, was officially sworn in as president at the country\u2019s embassy in neighboring Senegal earlier this afternoon. But Gambia\u2019s longtime leader, Yahya Jammeh, has refused to quit power despite mounting regional and international pressure. The battle for power between two men who both claim to be president of Gambia has plunged Africa\u2019s smallest country into uncertainty.",
        "The months leading up to the 2016 presidential election were filled with protest songs, most of them directed at eventual winner Donald J. Trump. The months since, as you might imagine, have been no quieter. The occasion of Trump\u2019s inauguration Friday is inspiring weekend demonstrations and benefit concerts across the country, and more protest songs keep rolling out right alongside them.",
        "All Things Considered Ari Shapiro is on a road trip leading up to the inauguration of Donald Trump on Jan. 20. He is driving through North Carolina and Virginia, on the way to Washington, D. C. These are two swing states that went in opposite directions in November, each by a close margin: North Carolina for Trump Virginia, for Hillary Clinton. As the country faces dramatic changes, we\u2019re asking people what they want from that change \u2014 and what concerns them. From her desk in Roanoke, Va.",
        "On Friday, when Donald Trump puts his hand on a Bible and takes the oath of office, ethics experts say he may very well be in violation of a lease on one of his premier hotels. The Trump International Hotel is a grand dame of a building on Pennsylvania Avenue, just a stone\u2019s throw from the White House. It has become something of a tourist destination in Washington \u2014 and a rallying point for protesters \u2014 since Trump won the election.",
        "On the day before taking office, Donald Trump arrived in Washington, D. C. to kick off inaugural festivities. His first stop: a leadership luncheon at his new hotel, the Trump International Hotel, blocks from the White House. The hotel has been the center of a debate over conflicts between Trump\u2019s business interests and the presidency. Incoming White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters Thursday Trump\u2019s use of the hotel for a reception shouldn\u2019t come as a \u201dshocker\u201d to anyone, and he even gave his boss\u2019s hotel a plug.",
        "A in downtown Tehran, Iran, caught fire and collapsed on Thursday, killing firefighters who were working inside the building. Reports suggest at least 20 firefighters died, and many more people \u2014 including firefighters and civilians \u2014 were injured. The horrifying scene was \u201dinadvertently shown live on state television,\u201d The Associated Press reports, and left other firefighters and eyewitnesses crying in the streets. More people are believed to be trapped in the rubble, NPR\u2019s Peter Kenyon reports, and rescue operations are ongoing.

        "There\u2019s been a lot of chatter about who is performing at Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration Friday \u2014 and who has refused, as well as who was or was not ever asked. For critics of the incoming administration, the travails of those trying to book these gigs have been the stuff of comedy and derision for Trump\u2019s team, the stance \u2014 at least publicly \u2014 has been that the lineup is exactly what they have always envisioned for this event: an inauguration for the people, not for the stars.",
        "Later today, six people will enter a dome on a volcano in Hawaii that will be their home for the next eight months, as they simulate a future mission to Mars. It is the fifth such experiment run by the University of Hawaii and funded by NASA. The latest mission on Mauna Loa, which ended in August 2016, lasted a full year.

He added that officials are still working to assess the impact of the strikes, but they believe more than 80 ISIS fighters were killed.",
        "If you think that you wouldn\u2019t be touched by a Republican overhaul of Obamacare because you get health insurance through your job at a big company, think again. Several of the law\u2019s provisions apply to plans offered by large employers, too (with some exceptions for plans that were in place before the law passed in March 2010). It\u2019s not yet clear how Donald Trump and congressional Republicans plan to revamp the federal health law, known as the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare.",
        "In a tense hearing Thursday morning, the new administration\u2019s Treasury secretary nominee, Steven Mnuchin, faced scrutiny from Democratic senators concerned about him profiting handsomely off homeowners who lost their homes during the housing crisis. Mnuchin, whose career includes a stint at Goldman Sachs and Hollywood movie production, got early praise from Republicans. But stiff questioning followed from Democrats for his role as CEO of a company that took over IndyMac Bank, now known as OneWest, which failed because of its bad home loans and later pushed through many controversial foreclosures, ultimately yielding massive profits for Mnuchin.",

        "Sweet potatoes are undergoing a modern renaissance in this country. While they have always made special appearances on many American tables around the holidays, demand for the root vegetables has grown. In 2015, farmers produced more sweet potatoes than in any year since World War II. War Effort, \u201dA lot of things were hard to get during World War II, and potatoes were easier to raise than some of the other vegetables,\u201d my grandmother Joyce Heise tells me. She grew up outside of Philadelphia. Her grandfather farmed potatoes, and their orange sister tubers, sweet potatoes."
