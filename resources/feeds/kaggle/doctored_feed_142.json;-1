        "The Obama Administration has dropped a controversial bill that would have required all publicly funded scientists to get permission from patients before using their cells, blood, brain or DNA for research. The clause was eliminated from the final draft of the Common Rule, which was registered in the Federal Register Act. The rule is a complex system of regulations designed to make sure federally funded research on human disease is conducted ethically. The revision to the rules, set to go into effect in 2018, marks the first time the rule has been updated in 26 years.",

Amid social and cultural upheaval, it \u2019 s only natural to seek out interpreters who utilize screams, brush strokes and dance to articulate the intangible. It \u2019 s only natural that punk responds in kind to its listeners and the hostilities it faces. It \u2019 s only natural, if flippant and ignorant and unfair, to say that punk only thrives under such circumstances, as if humans prefer oppression to discrimination.",

        "Set on an apparently tropical island, The Red Turtle (La tortue rouge) exalts the cycle of life and celebrates the beauty of nature. Yet this animated fable could hardly be more anthropocentric. The man around whom the film revolves is introduced literally at sea, battling to survive the stormy waves of a ocean.

        "For decades, Donald Trump both toyed with and coyly denied any interest in pursuing the presidency \u2014 until his campaign of the 2016 election. But if you go back and watch old clips \u2014 and by old, we mean \u2014 you hear a young Donald Trump sounding very much like the current Trump.

S. generosity while refusing to pay their \u201dfair share\u201d for all the U. S. does globally.",
