        "One of the great successes for Disney is involvement in a story out of India. The movie, released in late December, is called Dangal \u2014 Hindi for \u201d beauty competition. \u201d It follows two sisters born in the highly traditional north India state of Haryana \u2014 a city where women often show their faces and where in 2015 India \u2019 s sports minister launched a lawsuit against a longstanding practice of terminating a marriage because the fetus is female. With the coaching of their parents, the girls \u2014 Geeta and Babita \u2014 grew up to become wrestlers.",
        "Barack Obama took to the podium in the Congressional briefing room on Wednesday, the anniversary of the first black presidency, and after eight years of that seeming increasingly normal, the media made it all start to feel strange again. So this whole Barack thing really sucked, huh? It wasn \u2019 t that long ago that the idea of a black woman in the White House was a major detail in a movie about the apocalypse, a righteous villain in an implausible TV thriller, or the creation of Dave Chappelle skits.",
        "For many American women, understanding what seafood is good and healthy, and what should be avoided because of health concerns comes with a choice of. In part, that \u2019 s because the federal government \u2019 s advice on the matter, first issued in 2004, has long been cited as unclear. That guidance has given advice on how much seafood to use, and which species pregnant and pregnant women should avoid over questions about mercury contamination.",
        "Last summer, Georgia \u2019 s former mayor, Sonny Perdue, called up a farmer named Gary Paulk for some talks about planting blackberry bushes. Paulk thinks it was a prank. \u201d I picked up the phone and he said, \u2019 Gary, how you doing? This is Sonny Perdue, \u2019 \u201d Paulk says. \u201d And I said, \u2019 Yeah right, and I \u2019 m Mickey Mouse. \u2019 \u201d Paulk says he apologized when he realized it still was Perdue on the line. Perdue is now Donald Duck \u2019 s pick for secretary of agriculture, and Paulk expects that he \u2019 ll keep visiting farmers for advice, and maybe just conversation.",
        "Standing on the balcony of the U. S. Supreme Court on Wednesday afternoon, Kenneth Tam, the bassist and songwriter of the rock group The Slants, was sitting up. He \u2019 d just watched as most of the eight justices discussed whether the government should respect his right to use his lawyer \u2019 s name, which is a racial slur. \u201d If the court really truly knew about fighting racist discrimination they would have canceled the registrations for certain white supremacist groups before they ever approached our case, \u201d he addressed a crowd of reporters. Paul had just emerged from the oral argument for Lee v.",
        "There \u2019 s no room for ambivalence when you read Bob Dylan \u2019 s \u201d Book Of War. \u201d Among the three major contributions by our first Nobel laureate in literature \u2014 originally published as sheet music in Broadside magazine in 1963, and then included on The Freewheelin \u2019 Bob Dylan that spring \u2014 the words is a blunt object, painful in its cadence and damning in its censure. That \u2019 s true even on this gracefully bobbing forward version by Charles Lloyd The Marvels, with Lucinda Williams on guest guitar.",
        "John Marboe is a young pastor who grew up admiring his favorite garbage collectors in Lawrence, Minn. When times were lean for his youth, he decided to take on some job hauling trash. At StoryCorps in Boston, Marboe tells his daughter, Megan, that he \u2019 s been hauling trash since she was about 8. \u201d Did I ever tell you the story about when I pulled up to an intersection and there was a neighbor and her little children and her littlest ones just started waving and I was smiling, \u201d he says.",
        "Gene Demby of Showtime \u2019 s Code Switch team is in our mental chair this week as we continue by trying to make sense of all our reactions to HBO \u2019 s biographical drama The Young Doctors. The cardinals! The intrigue! The smoking! The... unexpected character cameos! It \u2019 s a really interesting show that has us a little perplexed in mind, so please join us as we try to figure out whether we like it or not. We do like Wild Or High Water, the 2016 romantic western starring Joshua Pine, Ben Harper and Jeff Bridges.",
        "xXx, in case you \u2019 ve wondered, is the other action series that Vin Diesel started with star Rob Cohen ( Stealth, Double Cross ) in the cultural revolution of the early aughts, promptly retired, and then limped back to ( after producers churned out four or more installments ). On his sabbaticals from the xXx and Fast Furious franchises, Diesel \u2014 a performer often portrayed as a \u201d visionary \u201d by impartial observer Vin Diesel \u2014 lent his visionary skills as editor and star to more personal ( and visionary! ) genre flicks like A Man Lives, The Chronicles of Riddick and The Last Man Hunter.",
        "Updated at 4 p. m. ET, The National Mall has flooded with pink, as demonstrators march on the nation \u2019 s capital site for the Women \u2019 s March on Washington. Just one day after Donald Trump \u2019 s inauguration, marchers from around the country have gathered in the area to protest his agenda and advocate for women \u2019 s rights. The event opened with a rally, to be followed by the march proper \u2014 which had a march laid out from a starting point near the U. S. embassy to its endpoint near the Washington Monument.",
        "Updated at 6 : 10 p. m. ET, As the Women \u2019 s march on Washington has swelled in strength, attracting attention and support in the to Saturday \u2019 s demonstrations, its presence has become something of a misnomer. Similar marches have been organized in all 50 states, many U. S. territories and even around the world. They have attempted to express solidarity with the theme of the original march : support to President Trump \u2019 s policies, and support of women \u2019 s suffrage and human rights in America. Given the quirks of time period, many of those marches kicked off before the movement that inspired them.",
        "On his first formal day in the White House, President Trump wrote to the CIA presumably to meet and offer an olive branch to members of the intelligence team he often maligned over their conclusions that Russia had conspired to influence the U. S. military. Instead, he falsely denied that he had ever criticized the President, falsely inflated the crowd reaction at his inauguration on Friday, addressed the media and told police officers gathered to, \u201d Excuse me. I \u2019 m like a smart guy. \u201d It was a rambling speech that was reminiscent of one of his campaign rallies.",
        "Making good on his promise to get started on \u201dDay 1,\u201d President Trump and his administration got right to work on Friday, taking steps to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and announcing the reversal of their predecessors\u2019 plans to reduce mortgage insurance premiums on federally insured home loans. The new president signed an executive order to \u201dminimize the economic burden\u201d of key provisions of the Affordable Care Act pending its repeal, allowing government agencies not to enforce regulations that impose a financial burden on a state, company or individual.",
        "President Donald Trump, fulfilling a campaign promise to start to repeal Obamacare on Day 1, signed an order directing federal agencies to waive enforcement of large swaths of the law. The order allows the head of the Department of Health and Human Services or any other agency with authority under the law, not to enforce regulations that impose a financial burden on a state, company or individual. It\u2019s so broad it could allow many of the law\u2019s provisions, including many of taxes it imposes on insurers and the requirement that individuals buy insurance, to die from lack of enforcement.",
        "Along with the oath of office at the Capitol on Friday, a much quieter part of the presidential handover took place, as the federal government\u2019s websites changed hands. Different administrations have used the White House website to highlight their programs and priorities ever since that site was founded in 1994. And much as the Trump team will fill the empty picture frames in the White House with what it wants, it likewise has highlighted its policy priorities on its website.",
        "As promised, President Trump got to work on Day One, spending some time in the Oval Office in between the inaugural parade and a trio of formal balls. Trump signed an executive order Friday night directing government agencies to \u201dease the burdens\u201d of Obamacare while the new administration and Congress work toward repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.",
        "Donald Trump had already emerged as the likely presidential nominee of the Republican Party back in April when he gave a foreign policy speech pledging that \u201dAmerica First\u201d would be \u201dthe major and overriding theme of my administration.\u201d It was a phrase guaranteed to prompt a reaction. Surely the two words sounded good together, but where had we heard them together before?",
        "People traveled to Washington, D. C. from around the country to witness the transition of power to the 45th president of the United States. Amid celebration and clashes, a few faces stood out. Watching giant screens, blocks away from the incoming president, these people braved crowds and weather to watch history being made. Ken Crider and his wife, Penny, Age: 51, City of Residence: Detroit area, Crider has a hat signed by Ted Cruz. Well, it began that way.",
        "President Donald Trump and wife Melania Trump ended a busy Inauguration Day with a visit to three balls in Washington. The Liberty Ball and Freedom Ball both took place at the Washington Convention Center. The Trumps took the stage first at the Liberty Ball shortly after 9:30 p. m. \u201dWell, we did it,\u201d Trump began. \u201dWe began this journey and they said we \u2014 we, and me \u2014 we didn\u2019t have a chance. But we knew we were going to win.\u201d Trump thanked his supporters, along with his wife Melania and Vice President Mike Pence.",
        "When the transition from President Obama to President Trump happened officially at noon ET, a lot changed, including the White House website. Waiting on the new website were six priority areas laid out, including on foreign policy. The entire foreign policy section is literally just 220 words, so it\u2019s hard to draw more than a thumbnail sketch about Trump\u2019s foreign policy. But it gives the first hint of something of a Trump doctrine. Echoing his inaugural address, \u201dAmerica First\u201d is the organizing theme. To that protectionist point, there\u2019s a whole section on trade.",
        "The inauguration of President Donald Trump was a divisive event, as the protests in Northwest D. C. showed. But a few blocks southeast, another battle was unfolding on the inaugural stage. Not between Republican and Democrat, but between a man and his poncho. Light rain began just as Trump started in on his remarks. Fortunately, many in attendance came prepared. Former first lady Michelle Obama and former second lady Jill Biden shared a bubble umbrella. First lady Melania Trump had one, too. Other attendees had translucent ponchos. Former President George W.",
        "Here\u2019s a quick roundup of some of the you may have missed on this week\u2019s Morning Edition. Inked, Don\u2019t cry for me, Susanna. Cry for the Charger fans and their tattoos. As Morning Edition host Rachel Martin said, the San Diego Chargers announced that they\u2019re moving to Los Angeles for the 2017 season. And unfortunately, their fans are not moving with them, but their fans\u2019 tattoos? Well, that\u2019s a little bit tougher. Tattoo parlors are coming to the aide of the fans though.",
        "Hundreds of thousands of Americans are now working as contractors for the rapidly growing industry, specifically for the largest companies, Uber and Lyft. But a new survey, released this week, finds that Lyft, with its fluorescent pink mustache symbol, is more popular with drivers. More than 75 percent of Lyft drivers said they were satisfied with their experience, while less than half of Uber drivers said the same. Lyft is a significantly smaller company, but its drivers made more money. According to the survey, Uber drivers averaged $15. 68 per hour, while Lyft drivers made an average of $17.",
        "It can be difficult to know what to say when a friend is struggling. The conversation is hard to even start. Maya Cohen, a student at Tulane University, says she knows better how to intervene after playing a video game created to help people learn how to recognize signs of psychological distress like depression, anxiety and substance abuse, and get them professional help. Like all incoming students at Tulane, Cohen had to participate in an online conversation simulation game titled \u201d For College Students.\u201d The purpose is to teach empathetic conversation skills.",
        "In its history, Gallaudet University in Washington, D. C. never had a deaf female president \u2014 until a year ago. Roberta Cordano is the first deaf woman to lead the school. Gallaudet is a liberal arts university devoted to deaf and students. Classes are taught in American Sign Language, and all students and faculty are required to know how to sign. But president Cordano never attended a deaf school herself.",
        "In the Central Valley, there\u2019s a bumper sticker you see all over the place. It\u2019s shaped like California, and reads \u201dMy job depends on Ag.\u201d In California, that agriculture depends on immigrant labor. Many farmers in the state supported President Donald Trump despite his stance on immigration. So as the new Trump administration takes office, what\u2019s the thinking of those involved in the region\u2019s biggest industry? Just after the workday ends, men in dirty jeans and work boots stream into a small record store in the farming town of Mendota.",
        "At Goats and Soda we\u2019re always watching the developing world. A group of international photographers is doing the same thing \u2014 but from a drone\u2019s perspective. We mined the website dronestagram (think Instagram for drone pics) for the most riveting drone photos of the developing world from the past year. Here are a few of the images we came across and the stories behind them. An island home Zorik Olangi grew up on Malaita, which is part of the Solomon Islands in Oceania.",
        "With no shortage of material to work with, Saturday Night Live satirized a packed week in American politics, reiterating themes imparted by critics for months. The episode kicked off by lampooning Russia\u2019s role in influencing the U. S. election. Cast member Beck Bennett brought back smug shirtless Vladimir Putin, the star of Saturday\u2019s cold open, to assuage America\u2019s fears about their new president, in a speech carried by RT, the Russian outlet. \u201dYou are worried that your country is in the hands of this unpredictable man. But don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not,\u201d he smirks.",
        "A top aide to President Donald Trump says he won\u2019t release his tax returns, insisting that voters aren\u2019t concerned about the issue. \u201dThe White House response is he\u2019s not going to release his tax returns,\u201d said Trump\u2019s senior adviser, Kellyanne Conway, on ABC\u2019s \u201dThis Week.\u201d \u201dWe litigated this all through the election. People didn\u2019t care,\u201d Conway added.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s first day in office has been marked by much of the same discord that characterized his campaign. In the hours after his inauguration, the newly President began some of the work of governing \u2014 even as hundreds of thousands of people gathered in cities across the country, and around the world, to protest Trump\u2019s presidency. Women descend on Washington, Many women brought their families to the main Women\u2019s March in Washington, D. C. which began with a rally with the U. S. Capitol in the background.
