        "The streets of Harlem looked vastly different the weekend after Donald J. Trump \u2019 s inauguration than they did the. Instead of the vibrant white crowds that crowded Pennsylvania Avenue on Inauguration Day, people of all colors, sizes and ages filled the stage for what \u2019 s being called the most diverse day for women \u2019 s rights worldwide. The Women \u2019 s March On Washington drew tens of millions to the nation \u2019 s capital to demonstrate for protection of women \u2019 s rights, including reproductive health care, LGBT rights and equal pay.",
        "Donald Trump took the oath of allegiance on Friday before a crowd speckled with people, many of them wearing the nation \u2019 s famous \u201d Make America Great Again \u201d hats. CNN \u2019 s Women \u2019 s March on Washington in downtown D. C. drew a crowd with vastly different political beliefs, but there was one difference, as the sea of people was peppered with fat, \u201d pussyhats. \u201d The ( mostly ) homemade hats were a clear reference to lewd comments supposedly made in a 2005 Access Internet tape leaked a month before the election.",
        "Updated at 9 : 00 a. m. ET The Trump Administration began its first full week in office taking crack at the media and arguing about media sizes at Friday \u2019 s protests. Press secretary David Spicer delivered a fiery broadside against the Fourth Estate from the White House Briefing Room Saturday night, claiming that reporters had engaged in \u201d deliberately false press \u201d in the past 24 hours since President Trump takes the oath of office. And, after berating the reporters, he walked away without taking any questions.",
        "Republicans proposed to turn control of Medicaid over to the administration as part of their replacement for the Affordable Care Act, according to an email to President Donald Trump. Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to McCain, told NBC News \u2019 s Sunday Today with Paul Geist, that the health care package that will replace Obamacare will turn Medicaid \u2014 a comprehensive health insurance system for the poor \u2014 into a block grant program. The change would mean the federal budget would give power to the states to implement Medicaid as they see fit.",
        "This post has been modified to include more information about the pioneering work done by GAVI, the Vaccine Foundation. It seems like a. Before you spend big bucks on a good effort to improve health for the world \u2019 s poorest \u2014 say, using millions of free protective nets against malarial mosquitoes, or offering millions of women microloans as small as $ 200 to help small businesses \u2014 you should take a smaller scale effort to make sure the system actually works. After all, just because a cure sounds good in print doesn \u2019 t mean it \u2019 s going to pan out in practice.",
        "Many in the science community have expressed concern about the lack of science concern demonstrated by the new Bush administration. A look at the administration \u2019 s statements and actions related to five key topics that are informed by science \u2014 anthropogenic climate change, vaccines, evolution research in public schools, environmental science and protection of federal lands, and human nature \u2014 bolsters that concern. As the new government takes office, here \u2019 s a look at statements made and actions taken by the Trump Administration \u2014 and a check against the science. Climate Change, In Nov.",
        "It \u2019 s not fair to switch the 2004 film Lemony Snicket \u2019 s A Series of Unfortunate Events to the new Netflix series A Series of Unfortunate Events. But let \u2019 s do it anyway. Both film and television show adapt the original three volumes in the rather popular and manically melancholy series of books for children read by Lemony Snicket ( Daniel Handler ) though the original series covers the fifth book as well. Both are different ways to Sunday, with lush brown and somber gray soundstages filled in for expressionistically bleak landscapes and baroquely decrepit mansions.",
        "Since it opened 50 years ago, the Haight Ashbury General Medical Clinic has been a destination \u2014 for everyone from flower farmers to famous rock stars to Vietnam War veterans returning home addicted to marijuana. Strolling through the clinic halls in San Francisco, Dr. William Smith, the medical clinic \u2019 s founder, points to a unique collage that decorates a wall of an exam hall affectionately referred to as the Psychedelic Wall of Mind.",
        "To revisit the box office numbers for 1988 is to remember when things that made a lot of money looked entirely different than they do now. Rain Man earned more money domestically than anything else that year. It was followed in the Top 10 by Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Back To America, Big, Little, Crocodile Dundee II, Die Hard, The Naked City, Cocktail, and Beetlejuice. Only one sequel in the series. That \u2019 s two adult movies ( if you count Cocktail, which... maybe? ) seven comedies, and Die Hard. In 2016?",
        "President Trump is now filing the documents necessary to remove his name as chief executive at his companies, thereby making good on a plan to leave management by Inauguration day. He may be a couple of hours late, but public polls show Trump is facing changes at the helm of his businesses. For example, a filing from Russia \u2019 s Department of State, dated Monday, shows Chairman Eric Trump as CEO of Trump International Business Management LLC. In April 2016, Donald J. Trump had been registered as president of the corporation.",
        "Updated at 12 p. m. ET, A team of business experts and legal scholars filed a lawsuit in Federal court Monday afternoon that says President Trump \u2019 s overseas businesses violated the Constitution \u2019 s Emoluments Clause, which bars presidents from taking money from foreign governments. The group states it is asking the court \u201d to prevent Trump from violating the constitution by illegally receiving money from foreign governments \u201d with ties to Trump interests.

        "Updated at 5 : 15 p. m. ET. President Obama acted on Monday to make a signature campaign statement : withdraw the U. S. from the EU. Trump \u2019 s action is highly symbolic. As he signed the memorandum in the Oval Office, Trump said, \u201d We \u2019 ve been talking about this for a long time, \u201d adding it \u2019 s \u201d a great opportunity for the American worker. \u201d Trump also signed two other presidential memorandums ( a pool agreement, and the original version of this document, referred to these actions as \u201d executive orders \u201d ).",
        "For President Trump, the easy part is over. During the 2016 campaign, Trump slammed the U. S. national security and foreign policy establishment as run by people who were \u201dso dumb,\u201d \u201dpredictable\u201d and played for \u201da bunch of suckers.\u201d Now he owns it. Trump\u2019s inauguration makes him responsible for responding to hot spots and crises around the world \u2014 challenges that scale from the risk of an individual terrorist attacking inside the U. S. to the danger of a nuclear standoff with Russia. The new president is still assembling the team that will help him.",
        "President Trump began his first full workweek in the White House by hosting a breakfast \u201dlistening session\u201d with business executives. In his opening remarks, Trump largely stuck to traditional Republican themes of lower taxes and reduced regulation. But he also reiterated his threat to impose a border tax on companies that move jobs overseas \u2014 a plan with little support from the president\u2019s fellow Republicans in Congress. Trump said he hopes to hold similar meetings with business leaders on a regular basis, perhaps quarterly.",
        "A doctor handed Melissa Morris her first opioid prescription when she was 20 years old. She\u2019d had a cesarean section to deliver her daughter and was sent home with Percocet to relieve pain. On an empty stomach, she took one pill and lay down on her bed. \u201dI remember thinking to myself, \u2019Oh, my God. Is this legal? How can this feel so good?\u2019 \u201d Morris recalls. Soon, she started taking the pills recreationally.",
        "Ajit Pai, the senior Republican on the Federal Communications Commission, will be the country\u2019s new chief telecommunications regulator.

Between the inauguration Friday and the Women\u2019s March on Saturday, hundreds of thousands of people came to the nation\u2019s capital to bear witness, protest and show support.

        "Multiple destructive storm systems damaged property and killed at least 19 people over the weekend, and continued to batter much of the U. S. with rain, snow and wind today. All 19 reported deaths were in the South, where apparent tornadoes ripped through towns over the weekend, damaging and destroying buildings in multiple states. \u201dTrailers are just flat, just laid on top of people,\u201d Debbie Van Brackel, a volunteer EMT in Adel, Ga. told the Atlanta on Sunday. \u201dYou need a bulldozer to pull it off.",
        "If you book a tour of Holland, the guide may take you to Volendam. It\u2019s a picturesque village north of Amsterdam, with cobblestone streets, tulips and a little old lady selling the local delicacy, smoked eels, from a kiosk at the end of the pier. Volendam is a small but prosperous place, with waterfront homes and sailboats tied up at the docks. There\u2019s almost full employment, and very few immigrants. About a dozen people NPR stopped on the street all used the same words to describe their town: . Traditional. A good place to raise kids.",
        "Even though studies show kids whose fathers take an active part in their lives are less disruptive and better adjusted socially, most programs that aim to up parenting skills are geared towards mothers. And a lot of dads aren\u2019t eager to sign up for parenting classes. So researchers at New York University created a parenting class for dads that wasn\u2019t called a parenting class. Instead, it was pitched as academic readiness training for preschoolers. But the fathers, who were mostly residents of New York City, did improve their parenting skills.",
        "Six million years ago, giant otters weighing more than 100 pounds lived among birds and water lilies in the wooded wetlands of China\u2019s Yunnan province. That\u2019s according to new research from a team of scientists who discovered a cranium of the species in an open lignite mine in 2010. They recently published their findings in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology.

        "Updated at 3 p. m. ET on Jan. 27, There has been a lot of arguing about the size of crowds in the past few days. Estimates for President Trump\u2019s inauguration and the Women\u2019s March a day later vary widely. And for crowd scientists, that\u2019s pretty normal. \u201dI think this is expected,\u201d says Mubarak Shah, director of the Center for Research in Computer Vision at the University of Central Florida.

        "LeRoy Rodgers spends plenty of time in the Florida Everglades \u2014 mainly in airboats. He works for the South Florida Water Management District. On a recent day, he eases his boat alongside a tree island. He doesn\u2019t like some of the changes he\u2019s seen, so he pulls a pair of clippers from a bag and hops over the side. Rodgers will need the clippers to cut a path through the Old World climbing fern that has almost swallowed the island. \u201dA deer trying to make your way through this,\u201d he says.",
        "Early in the morning of March 24, 2016, a Palestinian shoemaker named Imad Abu Shamsiyeh was having coffee with his wife, Fayzia, at their home in the West Bank city of Hebron. They heard shots being fired outside. Instead of seeking cover, they grabbed Abi Shamsiyeh\u2019s video camera and ran to the roof of their house. He immediately started filming, zooming on the street below. \u201dI saw someone lying on the ground,\u201d Abu Shamsiyeh says. \u201dI wasn\u2019t sure if he was Israeli or Palestinian.",
        "It is a very attractive truffle. It\u2019s made of the usual ingredients \u2014 cocoa butter, sugar, chocolate \u2014 with a addition. Thirty grams of dried tomatoes from Nigeria. And it was served at the World Economic Forum last week in Davos, Switzerland, with a very specific goal in mind: \u201dto raise awareness on food waste and hunger,\u201d as stated in a press release. That\u2019s a big job for a bonbon \u2014 and it\u2019s the reason for the tomatoes. According to U. N. sources, up to 75 percent of the 1.",
        "For a man with a mural of an oil refinery in his office, deciding to sue the oil and gas industry wasn\u2019t an easy choice. But it was a necessary one for Guy McInnis, the president of Louisiana\u2019s St. Bernard Parish, just south of New Orleans. On a recent day, McInnis stands overlooking Lake Borgne. Now an open lake, the area was once prime wetlands and marshlands that protected St. Bernard from storm surge. It took a big hit during Hurricane Katrina. Oil companies would dig through the marshy area to get to their shallow water wells.",
        "people have been arrested across Europe for allegedly trafficking stolen art and archaeological relics, according to Spanish police who led the investigation. Interpol and the U. N.\u2019s culture agency, UNESCO, helped in the investigation, as did the European policing agency Europol and the World Customs Organization, according to a statement by UNESCO.

        "For years now, some of the best, wildest, most moving or revealing stories we\u2019ve been telling ourselves have come not from books, movies or TV, but from video games. So we\u2019re running an occasional series, Reading The Game, in which we take a look at some of these games from a literary perspective. I have always loved Westerns. When I was a kid, I\u2019d watch them with my dad. Saturday afternoons on the couch in the living room. In the weird formlessness of Sunday nights. He had a kind of magic, my dad.",
        "Every day, Border Grill restaurant at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas uses a case of tomatillos and at least a case of cilantro. The tomatillos go into dishes like the pozole verde, a spicy stew with chicken and hominy. The cilantro goes into the green rice, the guacamole, the Yucatan pork roasted in banana leaves and just about everything else. \u201dThe Mexican kitchen is very produce heavy,\u201d says Border Grill Mary Sue Milliken.
