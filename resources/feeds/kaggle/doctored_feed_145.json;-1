        "BADBADNOTGOOD made a name for itself by reworking songs from the likes of Nas and Ol \u2019 Dirty Bastard, eventually catching the interest of Odd Future member Tyler, the Creator. The masses made notice in 2015 when the group released an entire LP for Ghostface Killah, Sour Milk. BADBADNOTGOOD has been called a ensemble, but its core is clearly jazz, which creates a gateway to countless artists. On IV, the group uses that gateway to widen, pushing soul and funk to the music.",

At his best, Ty Segall is a gifted songwriter trapped in the grip of a punk \u2014 although the energy of his rock actually leaves him grounded and focused rather than restricted. The California bandleader \u2019 s solo output over the past year has grown increasingly chaotic in its own humble and way at the same time, he refuses to set free the gnarled riffs, spilled booze and busted knuckles of his most blistering songs.",

The bungled launch led to a sales of 2. 5 million devices and revenues totaling more than $ 2 billion. The underlying cause, according to an ongoing investigation conducted with the assistance of outside experts, was internal short circuits.

All of these men have black lung \u2014 a disease caused by breathing in coal dust. Over time, the dust coats the lungs and causes them to harden. Hard lungs don\u2019t easily expand and contract, and that makes it difficult to breathe. \u201dYou try to get air in them, and they don\u2019t want to cooperate with you as they did before,\u201d says retired miner James Bounds, speaking with great effort.",
        "Over the years, music fans have slowly filled in details about a mostly anonymous collective of Detroit studio musicians known as The Funk Brothers, who were the backing band for many of Motown\u2019s hit songs.

        "The Women\u2019s March, which drew millions of demonstrators to city streets on every continent (including Antarctica) this past Saturday, was historic for its numbers and deeply striking in its planetary solidarity. The various marches were a flare for a new movement, galvanized by a shift to the right in national and international politics. The video for \u201dWork,\u201d a song released by Toronto singer Charlotte Day Wilson late last summer on her CDW EP, is a minimalist piece that alludes, silently and elegantly, to the nascent movement quickly calcifying around it.",
