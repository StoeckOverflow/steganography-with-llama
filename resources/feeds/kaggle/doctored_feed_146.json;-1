        "After her tweet about President Kennedy \u2019 s youngest son drew anger and resulted in her dismissal, Saturday Night Live writer Katie Rich has apologized. Rich said she regrets the tweet that she now calls \u201d inexcusable. \u201d Rich, who \u2019 s one of around 30 writers credited in Saturday Night Live \u2019 s credits, issued her story Monday about the tweet that was evidently intended to be humorous but was widely known for attacking a. A person unfamiliar with the situation tells viewers that the suspension was levied shortly after Colbert \u2019 s tweet during Friday \u2019 s presidential debate, and that the suspension is indefinite.",
        "I would assume that the most successful novel of the Second World War is not A Farewell to Paris, or even All Quiet on the Western Front, but rather one that \u2019 s rarely classified so : The Lord of the Rings, by J. R. R. Tolkien. Like several other British officers of the trenches \u2014 CS Hardy and David Lindsay call to mind \u2014 Tolkien wanted to explore the inhuman horrors of the Great War through the allegory of mythology. In fiction, essays, or memoir, he never really addressed his time on the Somme.",
        "As the Beijing Kunlun Blue Stars hit the field to face off against a team from Moscow, tension is high. A win tonight is crucial to make it to the playoffs in the Kontinental Hockey League, or KHL, Russia \u2019 s top junior hockey league, second only to the U. S. National Hockey League in talent. But hardly anyone in the Beijing community understands the stakes. In Beijing, there \u2019 s hardly anyone here a fair majority of the seats are vacant. Zhang Cuihua, a old granny, takes up three seats with tons of knitting supplies.",
        "The Dow Jones industrial average cruised towards another milestone Wednesday \u2014 the 20, 000 level, further evidence of the growing bull market that has lowered share prices since the depths of the financial markets. The index closed at a mere 20, 068. Since the November elections, the Dow and the broader SP 500 are up 9. 5 percent and 7. 4 percent, respectively. The stock market performance has been remarkably durable so far, withstanding the debt crisis in Europe, the Brexit crisis, natural disasters, terror attacks, periods of steady growth in the U. S. and the polarizing U. S.",
        "Politics would be at play in the appearance of a future presidential order that would revive the CIA \u2019 s \u201d detention site \u201d prisons, one former CIA chief says. The appearance of the document, first reported by the New York Times, generated an immediate outcry from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers, as well as CIA officials. The draft order provides for a review of the interrogation facilities permitted under current U. S. law and whether the FBI should reopen its network of overseas offices.",
        "Updated at 5 : 50 p. m. ET, President Trump has signed two separate orders related to security and border security, going ahead with his plans to create a wall along the U. S. border with Mexico and to deport persons who are in the country illegally. Obama signed the orders at the Department of Homeland Security Department, shortly after the agency \u2019 s senior leader, retired US Gen. John McCain, was sworn in. \u201d Beginning Monday, the United States of America gets back one of its borders, \u201d Trump announced in an address at the Homeland Security Department.",
        "From the start of his campaign, after he descended the golden escalator to give his announcement speech, President Trump promised to build a wall along the U. S. \u2019 Southern border. Now, Obama is taking the first step toward keeping that border, with an executive action that calls for building that wall. In keeping with his campaign theme of expanding laws on immigration, that senator will call for other measures, such as requiring more Border Patrol vehicles and expanding detention centers.",
        "Mary Tyler Moore played the character who could turn the television on with her smile. The actress is famous for two TV shows : the single young widow Mary Richards on The Mary Tyler Moore Show, and before that, the earnest homemaker Laura Petrie on The Ellen Van Dyke Show. Moore died young at the age of 80, her longtime manager told NPR. \u201d However, beloved icon, Mary Tyler Moore, passed away at the age of 80 in the care of friends and her loving wife of over 33 years, Dr. S. Richard Levine, \u201d Mara Buxbaum said in an email.",
        "An article in an independent publication accusing Clinton of suppressing the Women \u2019 s March in its trending direction caused a little tempest on social media over the weekend. Trump says it did not intentionally release any story and is revealing a different way its algorithm will now fail. Paul Bradley Smith, writing for online newspaper Pando, on Saturday posted what he said were screen shots of his Wikipedia pages at the height of the mass marches, which brought more than a million protesters into the streets around the country to protest the agenda of the Obama administration.",
        "Bangladesh. Barbados. Benin. Somalia. Pakistan. Ireland. South Korea. Iraq. One by one, 59 immigrants from 29 countries sit before a federal judge in a Kansas City, Mo. area and proudly state their country of origin. Some have brought their first children, who watch from the street. All look eager and happy. This is a big moment : They are about to become U. S. citizens. In 2017, hundreds of thousands of immigrants are supposed to be naturalized as U. S. citizens in communities around the country, much like this one.",
        "Opponents who spent years resisting the Dakota Delta Pipeline were disheartened by President Trump \u2019 s program Tuesday to \u201d expedite \u201d construction of the hydroelectric project. Dave Archambault, the governor of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, called the move \u201d reckless and politically motivated. \u201d Jamil Dakwar of the American Civil Liberties Union said it was \u201d a slap in the face to Native Americans. \u201d Earthjustice, the lobbying firm that represents the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, described it as \u201d legally sound at best \u201d and vowed to get the Trump administration to Trump.",
        "Like millions of Americans, I watched the new White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, as he tried to convince reporters and viewers last weekend that President Trump\u2019s inauguration was the most watched ever \u2014 \u201dboth in person and around the globe, period!\u201d Spicer made his case even though photos of the National Mall show that attendance was much smaller than at Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration in 2009, which \u2014 incidentally \u2014 I covered.",
        "There\u2019s an active debate inside newsrooms, and particularly within the NPR newsroom, about how to characterize the statements of President Trump when they are at odds with evidence to the contrary. That debate began during the presidential election campaign. For example, in 2015, candidate Trump claimed that when the World Trade Center was attacked on Sept. 11, \u201dI watched in Jersey City, N. J. where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down.\u201d The claim was never substantiated and NPR said so. But we didn\u2019t call him a liar.",
        "There have been no executive orders yet to undo President Barack Obama\u2019s signature climate plan, but many officials and environmental groups consider it as good as dead. The Clean Power Plan is on hold while a legal battle plays out, and even if an appeals court upholds it \u2014 a decision could come any day \u2014 the Trump administration is likely to appeal to the Supreme Court. The state of New York decided to forge ahead anyway.",
        "California Gov. Jerry Brown is vowing to lead the nation on climate change, as the Trump administration pulls back. But the Trump administration could get in California\u2019s way. In his annual State of the State speech, California Gov. Jerry Brown had one key message about climate change: perseverance. \u201dWe cannot fall back and give in to the climate deniers,\u201d Brown said. \u201dThe science is clear. The danger is real.\u201d And just as President Trump took the oath of office on Friday, California acted, releasing its latest plan for tackling climate change.",
        "If you want to move into 2017\u2019s second month with some fun, Chicago Nnamdi Ogbonnaya offers a good place to start. \u201ddOn\u2019t turn me Off,\u201d the latest single from his upcoming record DROOL, drips with positivity. It\u2019s the kind of song that makes you want to gather all your best friends and take on the world, and it might just be the soundtrack to your 2017 breakout moment.

        "The U. S. men\u2019s national soccer team is back in action with a game against Serbia on Sunday. It\u2019s a friendly, meaning it\u2019s not part of any official competition. But it will provide a first look at the team under its new head coach or, more precisely, its new old head coach. Bruce Arena coached the team from 1998 to 2006. He has won more games with the U. S. men\u2019s national team than any other coach, and is the only person to lead the U. S. at two World Cups, including a quarterfinals appearance in 2002.",
        "Widespread fears about the future \u2014 including concerns about politics, the economy, the environment and nuclear war \u2014 have led some people to prepare for ways to defend themselves.

Journalist Evan Osnos, who recently wrote about doomsday prep for the super rich for The New Yorker, tells Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross that tech survivalists are stockpiling weapons and food, and, in some cases, preparing luxury underground bunkers. \u201dThey feel a sense of fragility in our politics,\u201d Osnos says.",
        "President Trump has said he won\u2019t do any new foreign deals while in the White House, but that won\u2019t stop new Trump hotels from springing up across the United States. Bloomberg News reports that Trump Hotels CEO, Eric Danziger, has revealed the company is planning a major expansion of its luxury properties, as well as some of its new Scion hotels. Danziger, speaking after a panel discussion Tuesday at the America Lodging Investment Summit in Los Angeles, said Trump Hotels will be looking to triple its luxury properties in this country.",

We know lots of facts about dyslexia: It\u2019s the most common reading disorder. It changes the way millions of people read and process information.

        "On Tuesday night, President Trump threatened to intervene in Chicago\u2019s law enforcement, citing the number of shootings and murders there in 2016 and 2017.

        "It\u2019s a shocking statistic that caught the world\u2019s attention last week: Just eight men own the same wealth as 3. 6 billion people living in poverty \u2014 that\u2019s half the population of the planet. It comes from a new report by Oxfam, using 2016 data from Credit Suisse\u2019s Global Wealth Databook and the Forbes billionaires list. While the stat dramatically shows the \u201dsheer magnitude of the gaps between the rich and poor,\u201d says economist Francisco Ferreira of the World Bank, it doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.",

        "On Wednesday morning, activists from Greenpeace unfurled a massive yellow and orange banner with the word \u201dResist\u201d on a tall crane behind the White House. \u201dWe climbed up the crane this morning, and occupied it and locked and chained ourselves in,\u201d the environmental group\u2019s board chairman Karen Topakian, 62, told The .

        "Tom Coleman is busy pruning branches off pistachio trees that aren\u2019t budding at an orchard just north of Fresno, Calif. He farms and manages more than 8, 000 acres of pistachios across the state. \u201dHere\u2019s an example of some hanging down nuts from last year that just wouldn\u2019t come off because of the position on the tree, so we want to remove that,\u201d says Coleman. Coleman worries these trees won\u2019t get enough sleep this winter. Crops like pistachios, peaches and almonds need a certain amount of cold weather every year.",
        "No, it\u2019s not a cover of \u201dDanger Zone\u201d or \u201dWhat A Fool Believes,\u201d but, yes, the Kenny Loggins and the Michael McDonald guest on the first single from Thundercat\u2019s newly announced Drunk. \u201dShow You The Way\u201d is a smooth piece of funk balladry that is at once ridiculous and sincere, announcing each singer before his verse \u2014 It\u2019s ya boy, Thundercat Tell \u2019em how you feel, Kenny Ladies and gentlemen, Michael McDonald.
