        "As promised, Donald Trump has moved to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. It \u2019 s a concern for those who could be left without life insurance \u2014 and especially for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, which would have to pick up some of the slack.

ET, The Trump administration is considering alternative strategies to pay for the border barrier, backtracking on the president \u2019 s promise that Trump would foot the wall. A White House spokesman said one option taking shape is to eliminate a 20 percent tax on trade from Mexico, as well as other countries with which the U. S. has a trade treaty. That would effectively provide U. S. consumers with a larger portion of the wall \u2019 s worth, estimated at $ 15 billion or more.",
        "President Trump said if Mexico won \u2019 t stand for the wall, Mexico \u2019 s president shouldn \u2019 t bother coming to Washington, D. C. next time. So Mexico \u2019 s president postponed his trip. Mexicans are outraged by Trump and question their president \u2019 s decision.",
        "\u201d Buckle up. We \u2019 re ready to go to work, \u201d Vice president Pence told Republican lawmakers at their presidential retreat in Philadelphia on Thursday.

S. border, all before lawmakers arrived for the annual August recess.",
        "This week, Donald Trump \u2019 s transition announcement put new restrictions on government scientists \u2019 freedom to communicate. The restrictions are being regarded as temporary, and some have already been eliminated. But climate scientists, in fact, are on edge because the federal government generates a huge amount of data on climate. That information is used in everything from advertising to weather forecasting and insurance. Consider the example of a single agency : the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA maintains 17 environmental satellites, equipped with myriad instruments that collect data on land and in the oceans.",
        "If Twitter members fall silent in the meantime, can they still make a comment? Turns out, yes \u2014 lots. One afternoon, a new Twitter account called \u201d AltUSNatParkService \u201d entered and began tweeting out facts about climate change, support for the Theme Parks and comments in defense of President Trump, who has dubbed climate change a hoax inspired by China.",

        "It \u2019 s no secret that everybody has a soft spot for haiku. Springtime, sports media, the Super Network, even, um, grindcore? If it \u2019 s a thing worth covering, it \u2019 s even possible we \u2019 ve squeezed it into 17 newspapers. It turns out we \u2019 re not the only ones who are experts on the ol \u2019.

        "There they were, Greenpeace activists jumping from cranes in the sky. The banner, reading \u201d RESIST, \u201d unfurled within sight of the White House after President Bush froze EPA programs and ordered the environmental agency to remove research from its archives. It was a potent image document, perhaps setting a precedent for years to come. Writing under the Saltland moniker, Rebecca Foon released her second solo LP, A Common Truth, a project on climate change. The former cellist and composer works in environmental justice and has been a member of Esmerine, Thee Silver Mt.",
        "Donald Trump took aim at Chelsea Manning in an early evening tweet on Thursday. The tweet appears to lead to an published in The Guardian on Saturday morning, in which former MP Pvt. Chelsea Manning criticizes US President Obama as having been too ambitious to attempt compromise with his Republican opponents and being insufficiently progressive. She did not, however, call Obama a \u201d poor leader \u201d in so many cases, as Trump \u2019 s tweet might indicate. Manning leaked tens of thousands of documents to WikiLeaks in 2010 and was later sentenced to a prison term.",
        "What makes North Korea feel so oppressive? If you ask its defector in decades, the answer is censorship. Thae Yong Ho, who was until last summer a Pyongyang envoy in London, argues that increasing the flow of information into the North is what can sow the seeds of popular discord to bring down the Kim Jong Un regime. Thae had served in London for 10 years, and previously in Denmark, before he defected to South Korea last summer with his wife and two sons.",
        "As the Trump administration is expected to overhaul America\u2019s immigration system, some policymakers suggest looking north to Canada. That\u2019s because Canadians see immigration as critical to their economic success. The nation has invited in so many immigrants that today, of the population is . Yet Canadians don\u2019t seem to wrestle with nativism that has erupted in the U. S. and Europe. In Toronto, scanning a business directory shows how multicultural the city is: the Association of Bulgarian Engineers, the Canadian Network of Iranian Architects, the Association of Filipino Canadian Accountants. Half the population was born under another flag.",

Now that President Trump is expected to call for a temporary ban on Syrian refugees entering the U. S. these families may never be joined by the 23 others.

        "President Trump says he wants a swift and complete victory over the Islamic State, and he inherits the battle at a moment when the extremist group is losing ground in Iraq and Syria. The group\u2019s caliphate is looking increasingly fragile. Could 2017 be the year the U. S. and its allies break the back of ISIS? Progress is being made in the war against the Islamic State, according to analysts. But they caution that the U. S. is likely to face a recurring challenge in the Middle East: how to turn battlefield gains into a comprehensive political solution.",
        "The minute hand on the Doomsday Clock ticked closer to midnight Thursday, as the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists said it\u2019s seeing an increase in dangers to humanity, from climate change to nuclear warfare. The group took the \u201dunprecedented\u201d step of moving the clock 30 seconds closer to midnight, to leave it at 2 minutes away. The setting is the closest the symbolic clock has come to midnight since 1953, when scientists moved it to two minutes from midnight after seeing both the U. S. and the Soviet Union test hydrogen bombs. It remained at that mark until 1960.",
        "It seems readily apparent that the writer of a book titled Bad Feminist would register significant disagreement \u2014 to put it politely \u2014 with a writer who has called feminism \u201dbowel cancer.\u201d But when Roxane Gay realized she was to be published on the imprint of the same publisher that recently signed Milo Yiannopoulos to a book deal, she made that disapproval quite clear. \u201dI can\u2019t in good conscience let them publish it while they also publish Milo,\u201d Gay told BuzzFeed News on Wednesday.",
        "Girls in the first few years of elementary school are less likely than boys to say that their own gender is \u201dreally, really smart,\u201d and less likely to opt into a game described as being for kids, research finds. The study, which appears Thursday in Science, comes amid a push to figure out why women are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM, fields. One line of research involves stereotypes, and how they might influence academic and career choices.",

At 36, Venus Williams is the oldest Grand Slam finalist since Martina Navratilova\u2019s run to the Wimbledon final in 1994. For now at least, the Australian Open\u2019s final bracket is strictly for the club. On the men\u2019s side, Roger Federer reached Sunday\u2019s final with a victory over Stan Wawrinka.",
        "When I was 9 years old, suddenly finding out I would have to inject myself with insulin and watch what I ate every day was quite a heavy load. But Mary Tyler Moore gave me hope that I was gonna make it after all. Back then, in 1973, she was the only famous person I knew with Type 1 diabetes. She never looked depressed or unhappy \u201c quite the opposite. Daily shots couldn\u2019t be that bad, I reasoned, if Mary can do it and still turn the world on with her smile.",
        "Mary Tyler Moore, who died Wednesday, wasn\u2019t just beloved. She was the kind of beloved where they build you a statue. Moore\u2019s statue is in Minneapolis, where her character, Mary Richards of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, worked for the fictional television station WJM. She\u2019d already won two Emmys playing Laura Petrie on The Dick Van Dyke Show, but Moore cemented her icon status when Mary Richards walked into that job interview. Even if she got off to a rough start with Lou Grant, her boss, who kept a bottle of whiskey in his desk.",

I\u2019m the creepy guy at the beginning of the horror movie, imploring you not to enter the abandoned from the for a swim, at night, alone. You don\u2019t have to do this. Save yourselves! . .. Ok.

        "Editor\u2019s Note: On Jan. 31, Philip Glass turns 80. We\u2019re marking the event by asking a few of his collaborators and colleagues to write about him and his music. Paul Simon contributed lyrics to a song from Glass\u2019 1986 album Songs from Liquid Days. Look for essays this week from Errol Morris, Nico Muhly, David Lang and Laurie Anderson. It\u2019s difficult to choose one Philip Glass piece and call it a favorite.",
        "When Coates\u2019 new Black Panther comics hit shelves last year, they proved to be more of a challenge than a treat. That\u2019s no wonder, actually: If you ask a writer who specializes in picking apart the knotty mesh of experience (Coates won the National Book Award for 2015\u2019s Between the World and Me) to pen your comic book, you have to expect the result to be somewhat daunting. The new Black Panther incarnation certainly is that.",

Mauro Remiddi is broadening his horizons. Four years ago, the New musician released his critically acclaimed debut Strange Weekend, which was assembled in a basement in Brooklyn. Two albums later, he\u2019s issued Microclimate, and the backdrop is much vaster.",

Testosterone Rex: Myths of Sex, Science, and Society hit the bookstores Tuesday. \u201dTestosterone Rex\u201d is a nickname for the view that women and men are essentially different, owing very largely to biology. The hormone testosterone is, in this view, a biological agent that makes men more liable to seek a variety of sexual partners, more prone to and so on. Pretty much everyone agrees these days that nature and nurture both play a role in how humans develop."
