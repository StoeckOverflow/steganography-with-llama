        "Once more, the National Theatre has swelled with demonstrators. Just a week after President Trump \u2019 s inauguration at the Smithsonian and six days after the campaign \u2019 s March on Washington, protesters were raising their voices in the nation \u2019 s capital. The annual march they call the March for America attracted demonstrators from across the US Friday. The demonstration, which has been happening each year since the nationwide legalization of abortion in 1973, is celebrating a pivotal moment in its run : a quote from a sitting vice president. \u201d Life is winning in politics! \u201d Mike Pence told the crowd.",
        "Marchers \u2014 many of them women \u2014 are descending on Washington, D. C. to send a message about support to the Trump administration and the public. If that sounds like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, it \u2019 s not : What the Republicans call the March for Life is a protest against legalized abortion, unlike the Women \u2019 s March every week, which included fighting for abortion rights in its platform. A different kind of protest, \u201d I think we \u2019 re a pretty hot march \u2014 we \u2019 re a march, \u201d like March for Life President Jeanne Mancini.",
        "British Prime Minister Theresa May, the first foreign ambassador that President Trump has met at the White House, met Trump in a joint news conference at the White House on Friday. In addition to opposing NATO and trade, Trump was asked about his relationship with NATO and his views on the use of technology. NPR reporters have annotated the comments.",
        "President Trump spoke by phone to Jos\u00e9 Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico for an hour on Friday, due to statements by both leaders. Pe\u00f1a Nieto was scheduled to visit the White House on Jan. 31. But on Thursday Trump signed an agreement to move forward with a bridge along the Mexican coast and insisted that Mexico would eventually pay the price. On Thursday, Pe\u00f1a Nieto postponed his planned visit to the U. S. without giving a response.",
        "Russia \u2019 s president Vladimir Putin will congratulate Donald Trump on his election, in what the Kremlin says is the first phone exchange between the two since Russia was inaugurated last December. The call is slated for Sunday evening Moscow session \u2014 which is eight hours outside of U. S. Eastern. In other scheduled calls on Saturday, Trump will speak with France \u2019 s president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, White House Press Secretary Robert Spicer says. As for the call with Russia, Putin spokesman Alexander Peskov says it \u2019 s too early to plan what the two leaders will say.",
        "President Trump met with British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday, his first meeting with a foreign leader since he took office a year ago. With the United Kingdom preparing to leave the Soviet Union, May is asking for a trade deal with the U. S. \u201d I am convinced a trade treaty between U. S. and U. K. is in national interest of both parties, \u201d the prime minister stated at a White House press conference with Trump after their meeting. \u201d I think Brexit is going to be a great thing for your country, \u201d Obama said.",
        "Updated 5 : 30 p. m. ET, President Trump paid his first official visit to the top officials at the Pentagon on Friday afternoon and announced his intention to create a wide range of defense resources for the U. S. Military. \u201d I \u2019 m signing an executive decree to begin a great reorganization of the armed services of the United States, \u201d the president declared in a brief ceremony that preceded the swearing in of the new defense minister, James Mattis.",
        "The first years of the Trump administration has been marked by a flurry of executive actions \u2014 and lots of bombast and argument with the press. Donald Trump \u2019 s executive activities \u2014 in the form of orders and memorandums, which differ slightly \u2014 aim to assure that President Trump will agree on the promises made by Candidate Obama.",
        "I \u2019 ve heard the same advice from both our previous Tiny Desk Contest winners : They weren \u2019 t going to open the Contest until someone told them to do it. Well, the entry day closes at 11 : 59 p. m. ET this Sunday, Jan. 29. So here I am teaching you : Enter! Maybe you think your camera will take too long to decide \u2014 that you need professional voice work, a crew or great editing skills. You don \u2019 t. You can do this. Last year \u2019 s winner, Gaelynn Jones, shot her video on a smartphone. The year before, Fantastic Negrito shot his on an iPad.",
        "\u201d Rogue \u201d websites that have the look of those by real life agencies are spreading like wildfire on Twitter. The AltUSNatParkService Twitter campaign has gained more than 1 million views and inspired the creation of many more \u201d unofficial resistance \u201d platform for specific national organisations and other entities, including companies like Rogue Media and AltUSForestService.",
        "Ben \u2019 s Chili Pepper, a D. C. restaurant noted for its celebrity and ties to the LGBT rights movement, is preparing for some redecorating. This week, the restaurant brings over the giant mural of Bill Cosby, Donnie Simpson, Chuck Jones and President Barack Obama that has lived on its outside wall since 2012. Kamal Hussain, one of the restaurant \u2019 s customers, said his customers have been arguing about that mural for a long time, arguing over who should or shouldn \u2019 t be featured. Now, he said, it \u2019 s time to let the customers decide.",
        "With open tax season for buying home coverage under the Affordable Care Act ending Tuesday, it seemed like an apt time to chat with folks in charge of some of the different insurance marketplaces created by the Federal health law. It \u2019 s the second year these marketplaces, also insurance exchanges, have been running. The marketplaces are the best for people under 65 who don \u2019 t get health insurance through work or pay for Medicaid. This time around, there \u2019 s a wrinkle : The Bush administration has halted sales and outreach for HealthCare.",
        "The fireplace is on. A line of westies are running around downstairs. And two tables are occupied in the dining room. The Christmas party on this brisk winter evening in Maplewood, N. J. has a whole foreign flare : fresh shawarma and falafel are on the menu. And while the conversation includes typical talk about food \u2014 it also deals with food. \u201d Every day is something terrible, \u201d explains Hayder Alqaysi, who lives Baghdad with his mother and sister. \u201d You understand what I mean?",
        "Updated 2 p. m. ET, President Trump\u2019s freeze on immigration from seven mostly Muslim countries cites the potential threat of terrorism. But here\u2019s the twist \u2014 it doesn\u2019t include any countries from which radicalized Muslims have actually killed Americans in the U. S. since Sept. 11, 2001. The president\u2019s executive action, which he signed Friday at the Pentagon, applies to these countries: Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Yemen, Iraq and Sudan. Yet no Muslim extremist from any of these places has carried out a fatal attack in the U. S. in more than two decades.",
        "It was a bright hot day in June. Or possibly July. And the clocks almost certainly weren\u2019t striking thirteen, because they don\u2019t do that in this country. But it WAS the summer of 1984. I was 9 years old, and my father was handing me a paperback with an white and green cover his old college copy of George Orwell\u2019s 1984. \u201dHere,\u201d he said. \u201dI think you\u2019re ready for this.\u201d My dad has always had a weirdly inflated sense of my intellectual abilities. And I was captivated, instantly.",
        "The government of Chile says wildfires that have killed at least 10 people are the worst blazes in the country\u2019s history. Several firefighters are among the dead. \u201dWe have never seen anything on this scale, never in the history of Chile,\u201d President Michelle Bachelet said earlier this week, after her administration declared a state of emergency.",
        "Much has been written about the 20 million people who gained health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, and what could happen to these patients if the ACA is repealed without a replacement. But some people don\u2019t realize that hospitals nationwide could take a big financial hit on several fronts, too. First, it\u2019s likely that fewer patients would be able to pay their hospital bills, health policy analysts say, so the institutions would be stuck with that bad debt, as they were before Obamacare.",
        "American composer Philip Glass turns 80 years old on January 31. To mark the occasion, we asked several of Glass\u2019 colleagues and collaborators to pick a piece of his music and write about it. You can read essays on NPR Music by Paul Simon, filmmaker Errol Morris and composers Nico Muhly and David Lang. We also asked Laurie Anderson. She wrote about Glass\u2019 piano Etude No. 10, saying she finds \u201dnew ways to breathe\u201d each time she plays it.",
        "I\u2019m in the middle of tapping out an email to my dad, deleting and retyping sentences. On Friday night I\u2019ll cook an abridged Chinese New Year Eve dinner, I write. Maybe I\u2019ll cook noodles (symbolizing happiness, longevity) or dumplings (symbolizing wealth). I don\u2019t tell him what I\u2019ll do exactly. This is the first time in my adult life, apart from drinking parties organized under the guise of making dumplings for Lunar New Year, that I\u2019ve paid attention to this holiday. My dad is unbothered by the truncated menu.",
        "At any other time of the year, Shengping Lane bustles with life. But the Lunar New Year holiday is near, half the city has left for their hometowns and Shanghai has returned to the Shanghainese. The only vendor left in the alley sells calendars, but soon he\u2019ll pack up, too. It\u2019s the time of year when Shengping Lane lives up to its name: \u5347\u5e73 or \u201dRising Peace.\u201d It\u2019ll soon be the Year of the Rooster, and Yuan Shuizhen is preparing chicken feet in her tiny kitchen for the big meal.",
        "The day after his inauguration, President Trump placed a call to the acting head of the National Park Service, Michael Reynolds. \u201dI can confirm that the call took place. I can\u2019t comment on the content of the conversation,\u201d National Park Service spokesman Tom Crosson said in an email to NPR. Trump reportedly was upset over the agency\u2019s retweeting of photos that unfavorably compared the crowd sizes at his and former President Obama\u2019s inaugurations. The retweet was later removed.",
        "President Trump tweets a lot. With tens of millions of followers on Twitter, Trump proposes policy, shares his latest actions and reacts to the news. But 140 characters rarely gives the full context. During the president\u2019s first 100 days in office, we attempted to do just that for key tweets.",
        "Rafael Nadal has reached the final of the Australian Open, where he will face longtime rival Roger Federer in a matchup that answers the prayers of tennis fans eager to see a ninth Grand Slam final between the pair.

        "Niya Kenny pulled out her cell phone and began recording. It happened in 2015, after a classmate had refused to hand over her own cell phone during class and was being pulled from her chair by a police officer based at their school, Spring Valley High School in Columbia, S. C. When Kenny loudly protested and, like her classmate, refused to hand over her phone, she too was arrested. The charge: disturbing a school.",
        "Frauke Petry is a paradox. The petite German chemist with a pixie cut is well known for being tough as nails, chewing out journalists and wresting control of the nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD) political party a couple of years after it was founded. But Petry looked a little lost as the AfD hosted last weekend\u2019s summit of Europe\u2019s populist stars next to the Rhine River in Koblenz.",
        "Some say you have to have loved and lost to appreciate the beauty of the bolero. Since its inception in Cuba in the early 20th century, the music has been designed for thoughtful and emotional consideration of the joys and pains that come with loving someone so intensely, it becomes like a religion to adore that special someone (an actual bolero lyric). When the members of Richmond, Virginia\u2019s Miramar first heard the music of Puerto Rican composer Sylvia Rexach, they were intrigued that she wasn\u2019t as well known as other popular bolero writers.",
        "You may remember Mary Johnson from a 2011 StoryCorps conversation with a man that could have easily been her enemy. She spoke with Oshea Israel, the man who murdered her son, Laramiun Byrd. Mary met Oshea while he was serving time in prison for the crime. After his release, they became close and sparked a remarkable relationship. \u201dMy natural son is no longer here. I didn\u2019t see him graduate. Now, you\u2019re going to college,\u201d she said to Oshea back then. \u201dI\u2019ll have the opportunity to see you graduate. I didn\u2019t see him get married.",
        "As the toll of the opioid epidemic grows, scores of doctors have lost their licenses and some have gone to prison. Pharmacies are being sued and shuttered. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are under investigation and face new rules from regulators. But penalties against companies that serve as middlemen between drug companies and pharmacies have been relatively scarce \u2014 until recently.",
        "When the Oregon Shakespeare Festival asked playwright Lisa Loomer if she\u2019d be interested in writing a play about Roe v. Wade, she was understandably skeptical. The 1973 Supreme Court decision, which legalized a woman\u2019s right to an abortion, marked a historic moment, but more than 40 years later the issue is far from settled. Loomer says she wasn\u2019t sure Roe v. Wade would make good theater, so she started reading about key players on both sides of the issue. She says, \u201dThat, for me, was the story of the divide in American culture. I thought [Roe v.",
        "Friday marks the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 1 fire that killed three astronauts during a routine test on the launchpad. The accident shocked NASA as the agency was rushing to meet President Kennedy\u2019s 1961 challenge to have men on the moon by the end of the decade. The test was a dress rehearsal for the Apollo 1 crew \u2014 Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee. The ultimate goal was to check out the command module, NASA\u2019s first spacecraft that would take astronauts to the moon."
