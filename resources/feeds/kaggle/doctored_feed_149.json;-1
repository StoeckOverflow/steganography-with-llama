In 1939, the United States refused entry to another group of citizens : Jews fleeing Nazi Germany. Refugees are by definition the most vulnerable people among Europeans.",
        "President Bush \u2019 s temporary ban on the deportation of refugees is not going over well with the churches and religious institutions that handle most refugee resettlements in the United States. \u201d The faith people are going to kick and scream and object to every action of this disgusting, vile executive policy, \u201d says Mark Hetfield, chairman of HIAS, a Jewish refugee organization. \u201d [ It ] makes America out to be one that it is not.

        "Opponents of abortion laws are more likely to be Republican than Democrats. And Donald Trump was the Republican presidential candidate in the 2016 elections. But that doesn \u2019 t mean the 2017 March For Obama on Friday was exactly a real rally. The red paint America Great Again signs that speckled the crowd at Trump \u2019 s rallies last week were few and far between, and marchers ranged from enthusiastic Republican supporters to people who knew what his presidency might hold \u2014 despite his opposition to abortion.

Oral antibiotics are commonly prescribed drugs. Once an antibiotic is swallowed, it takes a trip to the stomach, where there\u2019s lots of acid.
