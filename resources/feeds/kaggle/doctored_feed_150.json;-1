        "At the State House, there is an easy \u2014 and usually quick \u2014 way for employees to express their concerns about U. S. citizens. It \u2019 s called the \u201d Dissent Channel. \u201d And lately, an unusually large number of foreign service personnel are using it. A dissent cable regarding Donald Trump \u2019 s proposed visa and refugee system \u201d runs counter to conservative values \u201d and could be \u201d counterproductive. \u201d The White House says it consulted for \u201d many weeks \u201d with the State Department before issuing its last order on Friday, thereby banning visas for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim state and suspending the U.

        "It was an executive order in 1942 that created the system forcing Americans of Japanese origin to live in internment camps. Shortly after President Trump signed an executive order to dramatically shift U. S. immigration policy, Fred Korematsu still is attracting special interest \u2014 including as the subject of a Google Doodle. Korematsu fought a discriminatory federal court all the way to the U. S. Supreme Court \u2014 and lost. Days later, he was awarded Canada \u2019 s highest civilian award. As NPR has reported : \u201d Korematsu was born in Oakland, Calif. but his U. S.",

This weekend, Chairman Sergey Brin took part in protests at the San Diego International Airport. However, the Google Doodle \u2014 the picture that appears on the home page of the search engine \u2014 provided a valuable reminder of what happens when the U.

        "Refugee advocates and resettlement activists spent a chaotic winter struggling to adapt on the air, with families in the air and no specific guidance on President Obama \u2019 s executive order that bans immigrants from around the world. \u201d There \u2019 s no way to get guidance, everyone is coming down from the top. It was hard at the airports, \u201d says Mary Nezer, the vice president of counseling and advocacy of HIAS, a global rights nonprofit that protects and resettles children.

        "Surprise and a desire for cooperation are some of the reactions to President Bush \u2019 s temporary ban on exports from seven countries.

        "In elementary school, you learn there are three branches of the federal government. But if you had read on the new Donald Trump White House floor before Monday morning, you might have only seen two : the executive and legislative. From Jan. 20 until about 11 a. m. today, perhaps one of the greatest differences between Barack Obama \u2019 s White House page and President Trump \u2019 s was the inclusion of a Web page for the executive branch. The judiciary did not focus on a general menu limiting viewers to main offices, such as the pages for the executive and legislative branches.",
        "A muted sight of the Virgin Mary calmed the revelers, a few hundred of New York City \u2019 s fortunate elite, as they navigated the recesses of the dark, cool caverns beside the Brooklyn Bridge on the south side. An orchestra struck up the first chords of the \u201d Blue Danube. \u201d The ladies were careful not to lean against the slanted, peeling walls and the musicians minded their coattails. Amidst the stacks of glass crates stamped ANTHONY OECHS CO. men began to waltz. A bottle of white champagne was passed around as a waiter produced a pair of crystal glasses.",
        "Screening for lung cancer using CT scans can save lives, but at a cost: Tests frequently produce false alarms and prompt unnecessary procedures.

        "One consequence of Republican gains in the 2016 elections is playing out at the state level where organized labor appears likely to face big setbacks in the coming months. Within days of convening this month, Kentucky lawmakers passed \u201d \u201d legislation that prohibit labor unions from forcing members to pay fees to the union.

        "What becomes of a town when its heyday has passed? What convinces young people to stay when good jobs vanish? Those are questions many towns across America have been trying to answer for years. And they were on my mind when I headed to Independence, Kan. with a dwindling population that\u2019s now below 9, 000. It\u2019s in the southeastern corner of the state, not far from the Oklahoma border. Independence has much to boast about. It\u2019s where Mickey Mantle played his first season of professional baseball, in 1949.",
        "Last fall, President Obama, on his final trip to Asia, stopped in Laos for the annual ASEAN summit of Southeast Asian leaders. While there, he pledged millions to help clean up a legacy of U. S. involvement in Laos: unexploded bombs. They were from the 1960s and 1970s \u2014 bombs the U.

As a result, federal officials and Medicare advocates have renewed their federal court battle, acknowledging that they cannot agree on a way to fix the problem.

        "Barack Obama spent much of his tenure scaling back the \u201dwar on terror\u201d he inherited from George W. Bush. In a few short days, President Trump has again set the U. S. on a more visible and confrontational course in dealing with the threat of terrorism. Trump has temporarily frozen immigration from seven mostly Muslim countries, igniting protests outside the White House and at airports around the country. He\u2019s ordered a comprehensive new plan be placed on his desk, within 30 days, on how to swiftly defeat the Islamic State. And Sunday, the U. S.",
        "It\u2019s been a busy week for President Trump\u2019s pen. Since taking the oath of office on Jan. 20, Trump has signed more than a dozen executive orders and memorandums in an effort to his policy agenda and begin to deliver on some of the promises he made during the campaign. But why is the president\u2019s directive to build a wall considered an \u201dexecutive order,\u201d whereas greenlighting the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines are \u201dmemorandums\u201d? And how is all of that different from issuing an \u201dexecutive action\u201d?",

        "Mika Peck, a conservation ecologist at England\u2019s University of Sussex, was frustrated. He\u2019d been researching and publishing papers for years on the of the Ecuadoran spider monkey, and not much was happening to change the primate\u2019s extremely threatened status. Not much, that is, until he started connecting the monkeys to gourmet chocolate. Both monkeys and cacao flourish in the Choc\u00f3an rain forests of northwestern Ecuador (el Choc\u00f3) part of a rain forest network that runs along the Pacific Coast, from Panama to Peru.

        "Utopian communities don\u2019t fare much better in fiction than they do in real life. As the plot usually unfolds, a brave new world loses its luster fast when the failings of its founder are exposed, or when the community itself begins to morph into a cult. Think of Lauren Groff\u2019s Arcadia or Carolyn Parkhurst\u2019s Harmony, two recent novels that have imagined alternative communities and their inevitable . How could it be otherwise in fiction?",
        "Cancer researchers are testing whether a generic drug that has been used for more than 40 years to treat parasitic infections may also help fight cancer. The tests of mebendazole are part of a growing effort to take a fresh look at old medicines to see if they can be repurposed for new uses. I first learned about mebendazole several years back when my son came home from camp with a gross but common infection: pinworms. My pediatrician prescribed two doses of mebendazole, and two weeks later the infection was gone.",

        "In a post published last week, Adam Frank argued for the importance of public facts, and of science as a method for ascertaining them. He emphasized the role of agreement in establishing public facts, and verifiable evidence as the crucial ingredient that makes agreement possible. Today, I want to consider two additional aspects of science as a method for ascertaining public facts \u2014 that is, the facts that we should all accept together. The first is that scientific conclusions can change. And the second is that scientific methods can change.",
        "Writer Laurie Frankel has written a novel about a family with five boys in which the youngest feels he\u2019s something entirely different \u2014 a girl. It\u2019s called This Is How It Always Is, and it\u2019s a story that\u2019s close to Frankel\u2019s heart because she\u2019s living it: Her own child was born a boy and now identifies as a girl.
