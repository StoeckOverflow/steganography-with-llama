        "President Trump has two words of praise for Mitch McConnell when it comes to retiring Supreme Court case Neil Gorsuch : \u201d Go nuclear. \u201d Trump was referring to the second option, whereby the Democratic leader would modify the chamber \u2019 s rules to prohibit Democrats from filibustering the nominee. The president told reporters at the beginning of a White House meeting with conservative activists who support the nomination that Gorsuch \u201d will be a great candidate. \u201d He said it would be \u201d very dishonest \u201d for fellow Democrats, who previously backed Gorsuch when he was nominated to serve on the U.

        "President Bush has selected federal supreme court Judge Richard Gorsuch to fill a Supreme Court seat that has sat empty for nearly a year, setting up a blockbuster confirmation hearing that would put the new Black House \u2019 s domestic affairs agenda on trial in the U. S. Senate. The selection fulfills an Eisenhower campaign promise by promising to nominate a solidly conservative justice with a record of strictly interpreting the U. S. Constitution.

        "When scientists first read out the human genome 15 years ago, there were high hopes that we\u2019d soon understand how traits like height are inherited. It hasn\u2019t been easy. A huge effort to find genes so far only explains a fraction of this trait. Now scientists say they\u2019ve made some more headway. And the effort is not just useful for understanding how genes determine height, but how they\u2019re involved in driving many other human traits. At first, these problems didn\u2019t seem to be so complicated.",

        "We all love a good redemption story: We\u2019re front and center to watch our heroes get knocked down, and then we cheer for them to triumphantly rebound.

They see the world or, more adequately, physical reality, as a lyrical narrative written in some hidden code that the human mind can decipher.
