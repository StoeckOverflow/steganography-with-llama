But his latest effort, Troubadour, is a musical \u2014 about country music in the 1950s, and a relationship between a star and his agent. When it comes to collaboration, Bush says he \u2019 s open to just about anything \u2014 \u201d If you ask nicely. \u201d That \u2019 s how he and Broadway playwright Janece Shaffer ended up working on the project. \u201d I wrote him an article and we met for breakfast, \u201d Shaffer recalls.",
        "The tribal man visiting Sheikh Abdelraouf was seen talking in the very early hours of the morning last morning when his nephew, Abdullah, spotted strangers approaching on foot across the rocky, inhospitable mountains of central Yemen. \u201d Who are you? \u201d Abdullah called out into the night. \u201d Who are you? \u201d The stranger shot him dead.

        "Updated at 7 : 30 p. m. ET, Despite the strong underpinning of the National Prayer Game, President Trump couldn \u2019 t handle settling a score. He blamed former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, his successor as host of Celebrity Apprentice, for poor ratings. He also got in a dig at the show \u2019 s creator, Mark Martin, who introduced Trump at the event. \u201d We had tremendous success on The Apprentice, and when I voted for president, I had to leave the show.

        "Ruffling U. S. diplomacy with one of its closest neighbors, President Trump is also criticizing an agreement with China \u2014 a deal that also reportedly prompted the American Senate to tell Australia \u2019 s prime minister that his was the \u201d worst \u201d phone call Trump ever after his inauguration. Late last night, the president vented his outrage on Twitter, saying : \u201d Do you understand it? The Obama Administration wanted to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why?",
        "Just how bad is the health of the nation \u2019 s highway infrastructure? So bad, tires on FedEx still last only half as long as they did 20 years ago, as they deteriorate faster from crumbling pavement and get more dirt from gaping potholes. \u201d We \u2019 re using around 100 percent more tires to achieve the same mileage of transportation, \u201d FedEx Chairman and Treasurer Fred Smith told the U.

        "It \u2019 s tempting to get the computer running smoothly and promise yourself an extra 30 hours of bed rest in the morning. It \u2019 s tempting to do it again the next night, too. But sleep inevitably runs out to getting up early for lunch or work. There \u2019 s a simple strategy to combat this : End all daytime lights at night for at least a weekend and drench your eyes in natural morning light, says Kenneth Wright, a professor of integrative physiology at the University of Colorado, Boulder and senior investigator on a study on resetting sleep processes.",
        "Researchers in Taiwan have captured dramatic examples of a \u201d firehose \u201d of lava plummeting down a cliff into the Pacific Ocean, sending clouds of lava and clouds of blue smoke into the sky. It \u2019 s derived from the big island \u2019 s Kilauea eruption, which has been erupting since January 1983. On New Year \u2019 s Day, about 21 feet of rock from the Komokuna lava dome collapsed.

        "A large flock turned out to see Punxsutawney Mountain on Groundhog Day Thursday, hoping to learn whether the boy saw his own shadow on Gobbler \u2019 s Knob. Phil was in an unusually feisty mood, but once he sat down, he saw his own shadow, officials deemed. As aficionados of the annual event will know, that means we \u2019 re in for two more weeks of cold weather, and as the prediction was read out in in Punxsutawney v. a sign was held aloft saying, \u201d We love Old Man Winter. \u201d But other groundhogs did not agree with Phil \u2019 s assessment.",
        "The famed groundhog Punxsutawney Phil emerged from his burrow Thursday and saw his shadow. As the legend goes, the sighting gave us six more weeks of winter. (If he hadn\u2019t seen a shadow, we would have been rewarded with an early spring.) But why is a groundhog predicting the weather for us in the first place? Here are a few tidbits of information about groundhogs and the day that celebrates their meteorological skills. Predicting new weather came from old tradition A celebration of future weather conditions existed long before groundhogs were involved.",

Every. Single. Day.",
        "For the second time in as many days, a Senate committee\u2019s GOP leadership has bypassed a boycott by Democrats to advance President Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees. The Democrats on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee boycotted the second meeting in a row to confirm Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA. Committee rules say that two members of the minority party must be present for a vote, but chairman John Barrasso, . suspended the rules so Pruitt\u2019s nomination could pass the committee with only Republican votes, and he passed .",

        "Humans get along pretty well with most microbes. Which is lucky, because there are a lot more of them in the world than there are of us. We couldn\u2019t even live without many of them. But a few hundred have evolved, and are still evolving, to exploit our bodies in ways that can make us really sick. These are the microbes we call germs. Think plague, flu, HIV, SARS, Ebola, Zika, measles. This is a series is about where germs come from.",
        "During a span, a team of primatologists witnessed 15 daytime births in wild gelada monkeys residing in the grasslands of Ethiopia. It\u2019s unusual to witness daytime births. Most monkeys and apes give birth at night, probably because it\u2019s adaptive for new mothers to have time to rest and recover from labor before having to keep up during group travel and, possibly, confront predators. It\u2019s still unclear why these 13 live births and two stillbirths \u2014 a small percentage of the overall births that occurred during the decade of observations \u2014 took place during the day.",

        "Sure, we all know the adage: \u201dThe best things in life are free.\u201d So why doesn\u2019t anyone advertise them? We\u2019ve got ads for deodorant, luxury cars and snacks \u2014 why not ads for sunshine, balmy breezes and children\u2019s laughter? That\u2019s the question we put to our listeners way back in 1972, challenging them to write some very noncommercial commercials and then producing a handful of our favorites.

        "The late Justice Antonin Scalia may not have been the original originalist, but he popularized what had once been a fringe legal doctrine. He argued for it both on and off the U. S. Supreme Court and brought originalism into if not the mainstream then at least into the center of legal debate. Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is nominated to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by Scalia\u2019s death, is a disciple of Scalia\u2019s crusade. Indeed, in a recent speech, he recalled how he wept on the ski slopes of Colorado upon learning of Scalia\u2019s death.",
        "In Washington, D. C. the cognoscenti confidently predict that Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch will be easily confirmed. But both supporters and opponents are chastened by the predictors\u2019 embarrassingly wrong prognostications over the past year. And that is presenting Senate Democrats in particular with a strategic dilemma. Ron Klain has been a key Democratic player in four Supreme Court confirmations, first overseeing two Republican nominations in the early 1990s as a top staffer for .",

The growing town of 28, 000 is about an hour\u2019s drive northwest of Chicago in McHenry County, the only one of six in the metro area to vote for President Trump. At Short Stacks, a small diner on Main Street, Ginger Underwood sits at a table with her two adult daughters.

        "Aggrieved at what they perceive as acquiescence to President Trump\u2019s agenda, liberal demonstrators have begun taking a page out of a doctor\u2019s playbook: They are making house calls.

        "The first time chef Jamal Hashi put camel meat on his menu in Minneapolis, it didn\u2019t go well. He tried grinding it into a burger and using chunks of it in a spicy stew, but no matter, the texture was bad and the sales were worse. \u201dIt was like chewing on a patty of rubber bands,\u201d he said of the burger. At its best, camel meat tastes much like lean beef. But certain cuts can be tough, and if the meat comes from an old camel, it can also taste gamey."
