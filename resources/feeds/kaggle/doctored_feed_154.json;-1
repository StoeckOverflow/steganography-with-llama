A decade and many trips later, a fortuitous meeting in Mogadishu with Mohamud \u201dTarzan\u201d Nur, a Somali orphan turned activist, led Harding to his first book, The Mayor of Mogadishu: A Story of Redemption in the Ruins of Somalia.",

But many cybersecurity experts believed that would change once Trump took the oath of office, because White communication devices are much more secured \u2014 and stripped down \u2014 than the smartphones the rest of us use. In fact, former President Barack Obama once compared his official White House smartphone to a child\u2019s toy. \u201dIt doesn\u2019t take pictures, you can\u2019t text,\u201d Obama told Jimmy Fallon in 2016. \u201dThe phone doesn\u2019t work.",

And now there\u2019s a new twist: Such payments can continue indefinitely because he\u2019s already declared himself a candidate for in 2020. Documents filed with the Federal Election Commission show that Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign paid millions of dollars to fly on his aircraft, compensate his relatives for unspecified campaign activities and rent space in Trump properties, including Trump Tower in New York, the Trump golf club in Bedminster, N.

        "Blood is red to the naked eye. Under a microscope, it depends. This isn\u2019t because it isn\u2019t really red, but rather because its redness is a macroscopic feature. Human blood is red because hemoglobin, which is carried in the blood and functions to transport oxygen, is and red in color. Octopuses and horseshoe crabs have blue blood. This is because the protein transporting oxygen in their blood, hemocyanin, is actually blue. The blood of a vulcan is green, according to the story anyway, and this is presumably because the stuff that carries oxygen in the vulcan\u2019s blood is green.",
        "It\u2019s been nearly two decades since the Japanese horror movie Ringu introduced the world to a new kind of specter, a ghost with stringy black hair and the movements of a body that looked like its bones had been reversed and rearranged.

There were a few themes that came up often \u2014 but then, there were also a few contributions that genuinely took us by surprise. They were commercials for things and experiences that literally none of our 2, 000 other ad writers brought up. But they resonated just the same."
