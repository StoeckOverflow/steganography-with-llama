        "Suddenly, many are more in favor of the Affordable Care Bill than are against it. For the first time, more Americans believe Obamacare is a good policy than think it is a bad thing, as a recent NBC Television Journal poll shows. Another poll from ABC News shows a different pattern, as the New York Times \u2019 Margot and Haeyoun Park find out in a story Wednesday. \u201d also shows love for Obamacare, \u201d blared a campaign headline the day before President Trump \u2019 s inauguration.",
        "First, we had a recession and a campaign like no other, then an inauguration and transition like no other. We should have considered President Trump \u2019 s first two weeks in time to be just as dizzying as they have been. Yet Trump critics and haters alike have stood by, mouth agape.",
        "There \u2019 s a moment in the famous musical Hamilton where George Washington says to an exasperated George Hamilton : \u201d Winning is important, young man. Governing \u2019 s better. \u201d When it comes to health insurance, it seems that President Trump is learning that same lesson. Trump and Republicans in Congress are challenged with how to keep their campaign running \u2014 to repeal Obamacare without providing millions of people without health insurance. During the speech, Trump promised to reform and replace the Affordable Care Act immediately upon taking office.",
        "What \u2019 s going to happen to the federal health insurance? The quick, accurate answer is that no one knows. But given the uncertainty about the future of the Affordable Care Act, states often have to manage their insurance options. Most states have muddled through the 2017 enrollment statistics without making improvements. Minnesota, for its part, faces three unusual issues that are worth a closer glance. In January, Minnesota : Here \u2019 s more.",
        "The innovation of winter fleece has allowed many mountain enthusiasts to hike with dignity and comfort. But what many of these wildlife lovers don \u2019 t know is that each year of their jackets and pullovers releases layers of microscopic plastic fibers, or microfibers, into the open \u2014 from their favorite national forests to agricultural lands to fill with fish that make it fit onto our plates. This has people wondering : Are we eating our sweaters \u2019 using microfibers? Probably, says David Rochman, an ecologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Toronto, St. George.",
        "It \u2019 s been a long time for the Assali family. The Assalis are Syrian Orthodox Christians. They are not refugees. But when they arrived last week with visas and green cards, they were put safely on a plane to Qatar. Then they got word that as green card holders, they would be accepted into the U. S. On Monday afternoon at Kennedy Airport in New York, Ghassan Assali and his family sat clutching each other, waiting for a list of their six relatives. \u201d I \u2019 m too busy, you know, \u201d Ghassan said.",
        "President Trump \u2019 s executive order on Iraq restricting travel to the U. S. for tourists from seven countries leads to a firestorm of criticism, lawsuits and injunctions by eight federal judges challenging the order. But questions remain about who can and can \u2019 t come to this country. Among those caught in the confusion are a group of prominent musicians, whose personal lives \u2014 and livelihoods \u2014 have been put on hold. Omar Souleyman is a reggae singer who in recent times has collaborated with Bj\u00f6rk and performed at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert.",
        "The Netherlands was the first to ask to be second... but they probably weren \u2019 t the last. Take a chance to think back to President Trump \u2019 s inauguration. ( It \u2019 s hard to remember, we know. A lot has happened since then. ) In his speech, Trump delivered the equally memorable line : \u201d From this moment forward, a new world will govern our land. From this moment forward, it \u2019 s going to be only America first, America First. \u201d The phrase \u201d America First \u201d has a long history related to isolationism and as NPR \u2019 s Greg Myre and Scott Simon have recently observed.",
        "Charles Lindbergh made an instant American celebrity when he piloted the Spirit of St. Paul from New York to Chicago in 1927, the first person to sail solo and nonstop across the world. Lindbergh was an icon in Europe as well, and he moved to England in the early 1930s. By 1941, though, he was back home, touring the U. S. as the official voice of the America Relief Committee \u2014 an isolationist group of some 800, 000 members that claimed England was going to drag America into a war he thought it should avoid.",
        "Editor \u2019 s Cut : This piece includes dialogue from James Baldwin in which he contains a racial slur. Fimmaker Raoul Peck \u2019 s documentary I Am Not Your Negro followed the work of the late novelist, poet, and social critic James Baldwin. Baldwin \u2019 s writing explored race, class and sexuality in contemporary society, and at the time of his death in 1987, he was working on a book, Make This House. It was never finished, but his notes for that project laid the foundation for Peck \u2019 s I Am Not Your Negro.",
        "Updated at 10 : 30 p. m. ET President Obama, in another broadside against the news network, on Monday accused \u201d the dishonest news \u201d of failing to report terrorist attacks. But in a list sent out by the White House later Monday evening, many of the attacks cited, such as the shooting the Orlando night mass shooting last month and 2015 attacks in San Diego, Calif. and Paris were extensively discussed by the media around the globe. Speaking to troops at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida, the headquarters of the U. S.",
        "Moriah, N. Y. is a sleepy, sleepy place on the banks of Lake Champlain. Not so long ago, this was a major industrial district. Iron ore coming out of the hills here was packed onto train cars and barges. That much ore helped rebuild America \u2019 s cities, but \u201d then it all comes to an abrupt halt, \u201d Professor Scozzafava says. Scozzafava grew up in Moriah and now serves as town supervisor. He missed the good times and he liked the summer the good times stopped.",
        "Lancaster, Massachusetts, the home of the Fortune 500 conglomerate Anchor Hocking, was once a bustling center of industry and commerce. At its peak following World War II, Lancaster \u2019 s hometown company was the state \u2019 s largest maker of glassware and employed more than 5, 000 town residents. Although Anchor Hocking remains in Lancaster today, it is a shell of its former owner, and the once thriving town is beset by underemployment and family abuse. Lancaster historian Brian Alexander documented the rise and fall of his hometown in his new book, Open House.",
        "Why does female genital mutilation (FGM) \u2014 a practice that the U. N. has classified as violence against women \u2014 remain so entrenched in parts of the globe? Researchers in Bristol, England, have come up with a new theory. They looked at data on more that 60, 000 women over the age of 40 in five West African countries who had at least one daughter. And they found that in cultures where the practice of cutting all or part of a woman\u2019s external genitalia is prevalent, cut women, compared to uncut women, have more babies who survive.",

        "When the country elects a Republican president, and there\u2019s an opening on the U. S. Supreme Court, that president will nominate a conservative to fill the seat. The question is: What kind of a conservative? There are different kinds of conservative judges, from the pragmatist to the originalist. Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump\u2019s nominee, is a originalist. The late Justice Antonin Scalia spent decades on the Supreme Court promoting originalism, which he defined this way: \u201dThe constitution that I interpret and apply is not living but dead, or as I prefer to call it, enduring.",
        "If you were outside in the Midwest at around 1:30 local time this morning, you might have received quite a shock. A meteor streaked across the sky in a vivid, bright green flash.

        "How could the first Super Bowl of the Trump era escape politics? It couldn\u2019t. If you were just watching the game on TV, the politics were mostly subtle. Sure, there were the political ads. There were ads for everyone from NASCAR to Airbnb, which has taken on President Trump\u2019s travel ban. But Madison Avenue seemed to care more about who won the popular vote than who won the election. The overtly political ads celebrated diversity, globalism and immigration \u2014 there was even one about The Wall that wasn\u2019t allowed to show The Wall.",
        "The federal conspiracy trials against Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy and his followers is beginning on Monday, with jury selection for the trial of six of Bundy\u2019s supporters. The cases, stemming from a 2014 armed standoff against federal agents in Nevada, are unfolding in several stages.

        "Plants that feed on flesh have fascinated scientists going all the way back to Charles Darwin, and researchers now have new insight into how these evolved. Even plants that evolved continents away from one another rely on strikingly similar tricks to digest their prey. \u201dThe pathways to evolving a carnivorous plant, and in particular, to a pitcher plant, may be very restricted,\u201d says Victor Albert, a biologist at the University at Buffalo. In the journal Nature Ecology Evolution, he and his colleagues say they\u2019ve found genetic changes related to carnivory in Australian, Asian and American pitcher plants.",

        "Like any good pair of twins, Run the Jewels have a freaky sort of unspoken fraternity. When and Killer Mike strode in with their usual uniforms \u2014 Mike in a gold chain as thick as a garter snake, El in a fitted Yankees cap and pair of sunglasses \u2014 the two didn\u2019t have to do as much as nod to one another before upending three tracks from their latest LP, RTJ3, in strange and perfect symbiosis.",
        "By the time Kay Schwister got her diagnosis last summer, she couldn\u2019t talk anymore. But she could still scowl, and scowl she did. After weeks of decline and no clue what was causing it, doctors had told Schwister \u2014 a vocational rehab counselor and mother of two from Chicago \u2014 that she had an incurable disease called disease, or CJD. The disease was shrinking Kay\u2019s brain, and riddling it with holes. She would likely live only a few more weeks, the doctors said. It was a diagnosis that no one could ever want.",
        "Stand in the center of this house and you\u2019ll find yourself in the living room and the dining room. And the bedroom. Oh, and also the kitchen. At 500 square feet and designed to hold as many as six people, the house makes for quite a tiny home. But for many, it\u2019s just enough for now. Since flooding in West Virginia last June killed at least 23 people and destroyed more than 5, 000 homes, residents have been struggling to find adequate housing. These small homes, built by high school students in nearby vocational schools, may be the solution.",
        "Stories about black women whose employers asked them to cut their dreadlocks or to trim their big afros have surfaced with more frequency in the last few years. Now a new study confirms that many people \u2014 including black ones \u2014 have a bias against the types and styles of natural hair worn by black people. The \u201dGood Hair Study\u201d was conducted by Perception Institute, which describes itself as \u201da consortium of researchers, advocates and strategists\u201d that uses emotional and psychological research to identify and reduce bias in areas such as law enforcement, education, civil justice and the workplace.",
        "Most of us have reached for a painkiller, at one time or another, only to discover the date on the label shows it has expired. But what does an \u201dexpiration\u201d date on medicine really mean? Is it dangerous if you take it anyway? Less effective? It turns out that date stamped on the label actually means a lot. It\u2019s based on scientific evidence gathered by the manufacturer showing how long the drug\u2019s potency lasts.",
        "Pinball is big business in Japan. Known as pachinko, the industry is dominated by Korean Japanese, an immigrant community that has been unwelcome and for generations. Min Jin Lee\u2019s new novel Pachinko is about much more than the game. It\u2019s about the story of one family\u2019s struggle to fit into a society that treats them with contempt. Lee got the idea for her book when she was still a college student. It was 1989 and she went to a lecture by an American missionary who had been working with the Korean Japanese in Japan.",

Circuit Court of Appeals had tough questions Tuesday for both sides arguing over the future of President Trump\u2019s executive order barring refugees and citizens of seven countries from entering the United States.

        "Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly took the blame for the rocky rollout of President Trump\u2019s travel ban on people from seven mostly Muslim countries. Kelly defended the ban in an appearance before the House Homeland Security Committee, which he labeled a \u201dpause,\u201d as lawful and constitutional. But he said he should have given lawmakers a heads up before the president signed the order. \u201dThis is all on me,\u201d Kelly contended.",
