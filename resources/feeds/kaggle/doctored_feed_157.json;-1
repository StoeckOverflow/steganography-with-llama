Ellen Bethea sat alongside her mother \u2019 s hospital bed after Mary told her that Archie, the doctor she had been married to for almost four decades, wouldn \u2019 t make it. \u201d As long as everybody else was gone and I was sitting there with him, he passed on, \u201d she said. \u201d So I think he kind of intended for me to be with him. \u201d Bethea says her husband had numerous health problems and dying of liver disease.",

        "At a roundtable meeting with deputy sheriffs on Tuesday morning, President Trump repeated a basic statistic about the U. S. murder rates that he repeatedly deployed on the campaign trail. On multiple occasions Trump has suggested the crime rate is at a historic low, a claim that has been repeatedly debunked. In reality, the murder rate is still at less than half its capacity.

        "A widely available blood test to track trends can give imprecise predictions, depending on a person \u2019 s diabetes and other factors. This test suggests diabetes can sometimes be misdiagnosed or used poorly. Doctors have been cautioned before that results from the A1C test don \u2019 t have pinpoint accuracy. A newly published Tuesday underscores that shortcoming as it relates to people who carry the sickle cell trait. Glucose levels in the liver rise and fall all the time, so it can be tricky to look at a single way to diagnose diabetes or manage the symptoms in people who have it.",

        "If you\u2019ve heard of interval training, you can probably thank Martin Gibala, professor and chair of the kinesiology department at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, whose research has helped popularize the exercise technique.

This perpetual cycling through archetypal phases of yin and yang, light slapstick and dour melodrama, is what lends Batman his unique mutability. His fellow heroes are a more stolid lot. They tend to pick a lane and stick with it. Not Batman. Dude\u2019s ephemeral. A veritable will o\u2019 the wisp, that guy.
