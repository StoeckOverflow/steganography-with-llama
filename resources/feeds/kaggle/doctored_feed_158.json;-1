        "Used to be, you could count on two broad truths : 1. Superheroes were jocks. 2. People who loved superhero comics were nerds. Sweeping generalizations to be sure, and they grew steadily less and less true every year, over the last 75 + years, superheroes departed the comic book trade for radio, television and theater, where they found themselves embraced by a younger, less obsessive audience. Often superheroes remain physically attractive, impossibly fit, and they tend to like to highlight their low.",
        "Seattle \u2019 s City Council has voted to not renew its contract with Wells Fargo, in a move that cites the bank \u2019 s role as a lender to the Dakota Access Pipeline project as well as its tens of millions of bogus accounts. As a consequence, the city won \u2019 t renew its contract with the bank that expires next year. The unanimous vote will secure the city \u2019 s more than $ 3 billion in combined cash flow from the finance giant, the council proposes. Seattle says the bidding process for its next investment partner will \u201d incentivize \u2019 Social Responsibility.",
        "The words were those of Coretta Scott King, widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. But they resulted in a specially invoked Senate rule being enacted to formally silence Rep. Elizabeth Warren,. On the House floor Tuesday morning, Warren read directly from a letter Scott King wrote in 1986, when King responded to President Reagan \u2019 s earlier unsuccessful nomination of. S. Attorney Jeff Sessions to a Federal district court appointment. Sessions, now a Republican Representative from Alabama, is President Reagan \u2019 s nominee for U. S. attorney general.",
        "When Senate speakers silenced Sen. Elizabeth Warren,. during debate over the nomination of Jeff Sessions to serve as Attorney general, they sparked a vigorous response \u2014 but also added a rule that \u2019 s meant to end civil debate. Senate Rule 19 includes this saying : \u201d No Senator in debate makes, directly or indirectly, by any means of words impute to another Senators or to other Senators any conduct or actions unworthy or unbecoming a Senator. \u201d While there is much reason to argue Warren \u2019 s original case, the rule itself is one that many of us Republicans do well to live by.",
        "A day after Senate Republicans invoked a conduct statute to end Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2019 s speech against the election of Sen. Jeff Sessions as U. S. attorney general, a 1986 letter from Coretta Scott Card urging the Senate to confirm Sessions \u2019 nomination as a state judge is gaining nationwide prominence. Warren was reading aloud from the letter by King, the widow of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.",
        "As part of our discussion of Black History history and culture, we turn this focus to how the influence of Africa has been seen in various Latin and American cultures. The music of southern Africa, where a majority of those enslaved in the Americas came from, was diffused through both an African and Spanish filter to produce the distinct sounds and styles that we know today. Cumbia, bachata, mambo and el jarocho are all quite distinct from each other and are still very vibrant expressions of diversity.",

        "There \u2019 s no way to prove it. As the cost of college grows, research shows that so does the problem of hungry and homeless kids at colleges and universities across the country. Still, others say the problem is closed to the public. \u201d It \u2019 s invisible everywhere to me and I \u2019 m looking, \u201d says Wick Sloan. He came to Bunker Hill State College in Boston more than a year ago to teach history full time. He thought it felt like he suddenly became a social scientist, too.",
        "Student parent. Ever heard that term? It \u2019 s used for a student who is without a parent, and there are nearly 5 billion of them in colleges around the nation. That \u2019 s over a quarter of the undergraduate students, and that number has gone up by half a million since 2011. It can be expensive, really expensive to be a single parent, especially if you want to pay for child care while you \u2019 re in class.",

Joseph Filostrat. \u201d But if given the order, we could go ahead and check. \u201d Filostrat, a spokesman for the island lockup, showed reporters on their first tours of Guantanamo \u2019 s prison camps since Donald Trump become president. It was a \u201d windshield job, \u201d meaning journalists would only view the camps from atop the high, topped and high that surround them.",

        "Ever since Donald Trump was elected president in November, doubts have been raised about the lease he signed to operate a luxury hotel in the Old Post Office Building in Washington, D. C. The lease specifically required the lease holder cannot be a federal elected representative. So critics repeatedly have called upon the federal Marshal Services Administration to cancel its agreement, and make Donald Trump walk away from his deal to run the Trump International Hotel.",
        "The official site of Toronto \u2019 s Trump International Hotel and Tower is 325 Bay St. in the middle of the city \u2019 s financial district. Think of it as Canada \u2019 s answer to Wall Street. But the hotel \u2019 s name is actually around the corner. So instead of seeing a single facade bearing the hotel name, what you see from the main Bay Street facade is a loading dock. This is just one of the many miscalculations that have undermined the Trump Tower Hotel and Tower, even before construction began in 2007.",
        "President Trump\u2019s approval rating with voters may be the lowest on record for an incoming chief executive. But in one way at least, his popularity is improving a bit. The value of Trump as a commercial brand, although still very low, has ticked up since August, according to the Reputation Institute, which measures the worth of various business brands. As a brand name, Trump\u2019s \u201dreputation pulse score\u201d went from 31. 7 in August to 39. 1 in says Stephen vice president and managing director for the United States and Canada.",
        "It was a familiar scene for many in New Orleans East, part of the city\u2019s Ninth Ward. \u201dAs helicopters hovered overhead and emergency response vehicles streamed into neighborhoods, it reminded them of [Hurricane] Katrina,\u201d reported Tegan Wendland of member station WWNO in New Orleans. \u201dThe area was hit hard by that storm, and now many families will have to rebuild again.\u201d \u201dThis house looks like it belongs in a Third World country somewhere.

        "Sure, the dictionary\u2019s a resource designed to give an accurate accounting of words in all their many shapes and sizes, their definitions and their spellings. But whatever finality a dictionary\u2019s thick binding implies, it\u2019s destined to beg adjustment just as soon as it has been set, as words take shape, wither from disuse or simply fall in and out of favor. Case in point: With this week\u2019s addition of more than 1, 000 words, will likely have to plan on a few more pages for its next print edition.",
        "This story is part two of a investigation. Read part one here. Shortly after Ed Howard\u2019s father was diagnosed with an advanced form of cancer and given six months to live, Howard and his sister Kathy sat down and talked about what to do. One worry was their dad\u2019s funeral arrangements.

        "As Republicans move to overhaul the health law, should people bother paying the penalty for not having health insurance when they file their taxes this year? Or will they be able to sign up on the exchange for 2018 after their COBRA benefits end? Here are some answers to recent questions from readers. I didn\u2019t have health insurance for part of last year and thought I\u2019d get stuck paying a penalty. Now the new administration is talking about not enforcing the insurance requirement.

Most of us look in awe at the towering rocket ship strapped to the launching platform and forget the tremendous amount of work it took for it to get there \u2014 and, from there, to get into Earth\u2019s orbit and beyond. Engineering, math, physics, chemistry, computer science: It\u2019s all there, waiting for . Now, travel back to 1961, when the U. S. A. was behind the Soviet Union in the space race.

Here\u2019s the setup: David Haller is a guy who hears voices in his head. It\u2019s driven him to drugs, occasionally criminal behavior and a suicide attempt.

        "Painter David Hockney once said, \u201dIt is very good advice to believe only what an artist does, rather than what he says about his work.\u201d On Thursday in London, a major retrospective at Tate Britain will give visitors the chance to see 60 years of the English artist\u2019s \u201ddoings.\u201d Oils, acrylics, sketches, photographs, smartphone drawings \u2014 Hockney has worked in every medium.

        "Political statements are easy to see when they\u2019re on signs or buttons or in tweets. But then there are those that are hidden from view, until you log in to the right place.
