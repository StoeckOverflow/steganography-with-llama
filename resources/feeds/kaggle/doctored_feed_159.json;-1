        "It \u2019 s President Donald Trump \u2019 s first political act on the abortion problem. On Monday, the new President signed a presidential memorandum reinstating the \u201d Atlantic City \u201d policy \u2014 barring U. S. aid from any group that support or \u201d promotes \u201d abortion laws. The policy dates to 1984, when Ronald Reagan unveiled it at a United Nations Conference in Vatican City. The Trump Plan is even broader than the incarnations that two Republican presidents have seen. What does this mean in practice? To really make sense of it we \u2019 ve put together an FAQ. What were the rules on the U. S.",
        "It \u2019 s a policy change that has been playing out over three centuries. In 1984, Ronald Reagan created an rule \u2014 known as the \u201d Kansas City policy \u201d after the town where he announced it. The rule eliminated federal funding for certain family planning providers unless they agreed not to \u201d promote \u201d abortion by, among other actions, providing patients with advice about the procedure or referrals to providers who use it. Since then, every year the U. S. presidency has changed party hands, the Republican leader has reversed his predecessor \u2019 s position on the ban. Hillary Clinton lifted it in 1993.",
        "Ten million years ago, at the dawn of the agricultural revolution, many of our worst infectious diseases didn \u2019 t exist. Here \u2019 s what changed. With the rise of agriculture, for the first time in history humans were brought in close contact with domesticated cattle \u2014 milking them, taking care of them and, of course, eating them. All that touching and licking gave animal germs lots of chances to get inside us. Take measles. Researchers think that up until about 5, 000 years ago, it didn \u2019 t exist. But its older predecessor rinderpest, a cattle disease, did.",
        "Updated at 8 p. m. ET, Kellyanne Conway, a political adviser to President Bush, may have violated federal ethics rules Thursday when she urged shoppers to buy Ivanka Media \u2019 s retail brand, including the decision by several American companies to drop the suit because of poor sales. \u201d Go buy Ivanka \u2019 s stuff, is what I was [ thinking ] \u2014 I hate shopping and I \u2019 m ready to go get some myself first, \u201d Conway said in an interview on Fox Friends. \u201d This is just [ a ] fine line, \u201d she added. \u201d I \u2019 m supposed to give a free one here. Go buy it today, everybody.",
        "A bit more than a year ago, President George W. Bush \u2019 s personal secretary, Scott McClellan, left his credibility in tatters after it became clear he had misled reporters about the leaking of the documents of a CIA operative. Even though he arguably had been set up by White House aides, McClellan disappeared some months later. Why? Establishing connections between the White House press secretary and the reporters he or she speaks with every day is unacceptable.",
        "Ask anyone about his or her health care and you are sure to hear about doctors, medications, maybe costs and government hassles. Most people don \u2019 t go back from \u201d my health \u201d to a political one, and yet that is what our country has been embroiled in for nearly a decade. A study last Thursday tries to put aside the politics to look at what makes or breaks health insurance markets in many states.",
        "Premiums for Obamacare plans run by New Mexico Tax Connections could rise as high as 7 percent next year, said Martin Hickey, the Insurance company \u2019 s CEO. Or they might soar as much as 40 percent, he said. It all depends on what happens in government. Such is the vast uncertainty about how the Obama administration and Congress are delivering their promises to repeal, replace and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. There is \u201d also massive confusion, \u201d said Hickey, whose plan is one of the few nonprofit insurance endorsed by the ACA to still be in business.",
        "Updated at 2 : 49 p. m. ET, An Arizona girl who has lived in the U. S. for more than four decades was arrested Friday night after her regular with US officials and has been deported to Mexico. She was sent to Nogales, Mexico, on Friday, reports Katherine Fritcke of talk station KJZZ. Guadalupe Rodr\u00edguez de Rayos \u2019 deportation \u2014 which has been witnessed by dozens of activists, some of whom were detained late Wednesday \u2014 is a reminder of how immigration enforcement is viewed under the Trump administration.",
        "Tuesday was a great day for education officers. Betsy DeVos, you may have suspected, was confirmed as secretary of education with an unprecedented tiebreaker vote. The House of Representatives also managed to throw out a lot of rules that were decided on just last night. These rules tell everyone how to comply with the new federal education law with regard to identifying and improving underperforming schools, as well as evaluating outcomes in higher education. And Mr. Thomas Massie, a Republican representing Kentucky \u2019 s 4th District, introduced a bill in the House as well.",
        "Updated at 3 : 20 p. m. ET President Trump started the day by blasting a fellow senator who revealed statements of Trump from his nominee to the Supreme Court on Wednesday. Judge Neil Gorsuch told California Sen. Richard Blumenthal that he found President Trump \u2019 s initial attacks on judges to be \u201d demoralizing \u201d and \u201d disheartening. \u201d Gorsuch delivered the comments during a private dinner, and a member of the Supreme Court nomination team accompanying Gorsuch through the meetings also delivered the remarks to NPR \u2019 s Jack Keith.",
        "This is day three without police walking the streets in Espirito Santo, a municipality in southern Brazil. And groups of army troops have not been able to quell a spasm of deadly violence there that has never killed more than 100 people. \u201d This is partially because the state \u2019 s police are \u2014 in public \u2014 on strike because their family and friends are blocking access to their car, in a protest over low taxes and poor conditions, \u201d Harvard \u2019 s Philip Reeves reported from Rio de Janeiro. Police are prevented by prosecutors from striking themselves, according to the Wall Street Journal.",
        "Thousands more troops and billions more dollars are needed to keep the war in Afghanistan out of a \u201d stalemate, \u201d the former U. S. commander in Afghanistan warned Congress on Thursday. Army Gen. Paul Nicholson also told the Senate Armed Services Committee that outside forces have increased their meddling in Afghanistan over the past year, especially today, in ways that make it tougher for the U. S. government in Kabul to intervene and keep gains against Afghanistan. That \u2019 s why the U. S.",
        "Updated on Feb. 10 at 1:40 p. m. ET. If President Trump were to call a meeting of his Cabinet today, he wouldn\u2019t need a very big table. Or, he\u2019d have to invite a bunch of Obama administration holdovers serving temporarily in acting roles. With the Senate\u2019s confirmation this week of Betsy DeVos as education secretary, Jeff Sessions as attorney general and Tom Price to lead Health and Human Services, Trump now has just seven members of his Cabinet confirmed. By this point in 2009, President Obama had 12 Cabinet members in place and President George W.",
        "For all the talk of Hollywood smut rotting the moral fabric of society, it\u2019s worth noting that, when the public demanded the industry embrace a franchise whose only claim to fame was smut, it chose instead to keep things . Fifty Shades of Grey, the first book in E. L. James\u2019s massively popular trilogy of erotica that began life as Twilight fanfiction, gave Universal Pictures a golden ticket to push the boundaries of sex in mainstream cinema. Lord knows the fanbase wasn\u2019t clamoring for the story.",
        "President Trump met with airline executives on Thursday morning and had a message they were happy to hear, vowing to roll back regulations, lower corporate taxes and modernize the air traffic control system. Trump said his private pilot, \u201da real expert\u201d and a \u201dsmart guy,\u201d has told him that the government has been buying the wrong type of equipment in its effort to upgrade the current control system. He said U. S. airports \u201dused to be the best, now they\u2019re at the bottom of the rung.\u201d He also said there are no fast trains in the U. S.",
        "Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe arrives Thursday in Washington for talks on Friday with Donald Trump, an effort by this longtime Asian ally to get a better read on the way forward with the unpredictable new U. S. president. The trip comes just a week after the Trump administration made its first appearance overseas. U. S.

The Cheyenne River Sioux \u201dfiled a legal challenge in federal court in Washington, D. C. on Thursday,\u201d the AP says.

        "The Senate has confirmed President Trump\u2019s nominee Jeff Sessions to be the next attorney general, bringing an end to a bitter confirmation fight that has dredged up past accusations of racism against the Alabama senator. The vote was largely along party lines, with only centrist Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia voting yes. Sessions himself voted \u201dpresent\u201d on his own nomination. During the past month, Democrats have brought up the past allegations of racism against Sessions, which sank his nomination by President Ronald Reagan three decades ago to be a federal judge. The .

        "President Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will be spending their weekend getting to know each other at in Palm Beach, Fla. And that\u2019s really the purpose of the club: to allow people to socialize at a spectacular estate built nearly a century ago by a wealthy heiress.

        "President Trump and his top aides can\u2019t seem to shake the Russian bear that follows them around. It put its paw on the scales of the U. S. presidential election last year, according to the U. S. intelligence community. It cost Trump his manager, Paul Manafort.

        "Science is knowledge. The practice of science is nothing more, and nothing less, than the earnest and thoughtful work of figuring things out, of trying to understand, of learning how things work. Scientists are people committed to this practice, or to a community of shared practice. They work together to understand. And understanding is a thing of immense power. If you understand why the car has stalled, for example, you can fix it. And if you know when the tide will ebb, you can escape the harbor. Science, thought of this way, is plural."
