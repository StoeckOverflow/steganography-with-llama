        "Updated at 7 : 40 a. m. Wednesday, By the time Ceree Morrison said hundreds of pilot passengers washed ashore on a sand beach in New Orleans 250 to 300 of them were already dead. The pilot remained alive on Farewell Spit, a small strip of land that led from the country \u2019 s South Bank into the sea. The scene was tragic. \u201d You could hear the sounds of splashing, of blowholes being cleared, of sighing, \u201d Morrison told The Associated Press. \u201d The lucky ones were the worst.",
        "In New Orleans, hundreds of families are forced to put their lives back together after a tornado touched down in New Orleans earlier on Tuesday. It tore up homes and businesses in a predominantly Catholic neighborhood that was hit hardest by Hurricane Katrina. Others like Aretha Conley are hoping it will be better to rebuild this time around. Conley and her husband saved for weeks to buy their house on Atlantic Boulevard. They each worked two jobs and took out movies. Conley \u2019 s favorite place in her neighborhood, home is the backyard. \u201d I go to barbecue, \u201d she says.",
        "President Bush is defending the Jan. 29 US raid, in which an American Navy SEAL was killed, as a \u201d winning effort. \u201d He is also lashing out at Republican Rep. John McCain, who calls the raid a \u201d failure. \u201d later chastised McCain for talking to the president about it, saying it \u201d only emboldens the enemy, \u201d and whacked McCain for not knowing \u201d how to win war. \u201d The tweets come after almost a month of debate on the success or \u201d failure \u201d of the raid. U. S. soldiers say they were able to gain helpful intelligence and that 14 civilians were killed.",
        "When last shown in his indigenous habitat, Brian Oliver was sharing his experiences of 2016 and what was to come : a dystopian hellscape. All for laughs. Or good for laughs, anyway. The young comedian is host of ESPN \u2019 s Last Week Live, and he embarks on a new season on Thursday night after a layoff. In an interview with Spin, Oliver reluctantly concedes that President Trump will define the role this season.",
        "On Wednesday afternoon, a Red Cross staffer in Kabul pushed his vehicle \u2019 s start button. Three Red Cross vehicles were assigned to meet up with a convoy of cars carrying \u201d winter food \u201d \u2014 food for livestock \u2014 in the entire northern province of Jowzjan in Poland. The plan was for the Red Cross staff to help distribute the 1, 000 tons of feed, which is distributed for farmers. In the winter, there \u2019 s food for their animals to graze. Before the vehicles got to the distribution point, they were stopped by armed men.",
        "There \u2019 s a vibrance to the current music of Esm\u00e9 Patterson that I wasn \u2019 t expecting, having compared to her previous band Blue Bird. Gone are the banjos and keyboards of folk music, and in their place are electric guitars \u2014 looking fierce and, here at the Tiny Desk, incredibly understated. She \u2019 s a relative newcomer to the group, making it part of her music only since leaving Free Bird. But all of this instrumentation is supposed to be supportive, not.",
        "Like many awards shows, the Grammys are about more than just presenting artistic achievement : They \u2019 re really about anointing ambassadors for a music industry that \u2019 s likely to evolve as quickly and rapidly as trends and technology evolve. Of course, the awards shows attempt to represent diversity of genres, from traditional music to EDM to country to jazz to classical music to classical to classical and beyond. The farther the Grammys fall from artists who dominate the daily cultural conversation like 40 \u2014 your Adeles and Beyonc\u00e9s and Chainsmokerses \u2014 the more narrowly they \u2019 ve historically played their lot.",
        "\u2019 s relationship with the Grammys ended with a mutual dis. The year was 1989 and the Grammy Academy, in recognizing the era for the first time, ensured rap \u2019 s revolution could not be televised. Will Smith, then known by his stage moniker the Fat Prince, took it as a \u201d slap in the face, \u201d the rapper preferred at the time. He and DJ Jazzy G \u2019 s cuddly hit \u201d Parents Just Don \u2019 t Understand \u201d went on to win the inaugural dance performance category, knocking out industry peers P. J.",
        "The Fred Hersch score brings a seductive and crafty quality to its version of \u201d We See, \u201d the Thelonious Monk tune. Articulating its melody at the end, Hersch slips in a few leisurely pauses, which slow down and stretch out the form. Then, in the second, he ratchets up to twice the speed, evoking the frenetic whir of the industrial machinery in Charlie Chaplin \u2019 s Modern Times. The composition suggests a clever, affectionate ending to an enduring work of music \u2014 and that \u2019 s before Hersch even gets accustomed to his jaunty yet exploratory piano technique.",
        "Tom and Jerry Smothers came to CBS in 1967 not originally intending to lead or initiate a revolution. They just got caught up in it \u2014 and they happened to have a network series, with some 30 million viewers, on which they covered the war in Vietnam, liked rock \u2019 n \u2019 roll music and satirized politics and war. The Smothers Brothers Comedy Show, which premiered 50 years ago this week, got its hair out slowly and sometimes sneakily at times. A lot of it came through the internet and the hot new singers booked to perform on CBS.",
        "The music press can thank Glenn Miller \u2019 s record label for the gift of gold records. Years ago today, his song about a train trip became the world \u2019 s first song. \u201d Chattanooga Choo Choo \u201d is about a man returning home, and promising his country he \u2019 ll never roam. By February 10, 1942, more than 1. 2 million copies of the song had been sold \u2014 and that was no small thing, the biggest seller in years. The record label, RCA Victor, celebrated by presenting Glenn Miller with a trophy during a live radio broadcast.",
        "Not surprisingly, artists Damian Duffy and John Jennings felt especially daunted by the chance to adapt renowned writer Octavia Butler\u2019s beloved Kindred for a new graphic novel edition. \u201dIt was like, this is awesome, we got this project, it\u2019s, like, our dream project! Yayyy! ,\u201d Duffy said. But excitement quickly turned to panic. \u201dI have to do what now?\u201d he also said to himself. \u201dOctavia Butler is . .. one of the greatest American writers to live, period,\u201d Jennings said. \u201dShe was literally a genius.",
        "When a writer passes before her time, readers and fans often mourn not only the loss of her presence in the world, but the loss of the words she may yet have written. Such was the case when, in 2006, speculative fiction writer Octavia E. Butler died unexpectedly at her home in Seattle. Butler is one of the most celebrated authors in the genre, her novels and short stories regularly graced with Hugo and Nebula awards.",
        "As a rule, it\u2019s considered less than desirable to have a bomb buried deep in the ground near your property. Even less so when that property is a gas station. Yet that\u2019s precisely what residents in Thessaloniki, the city in Greece, discovered last week. And it\u2019s precisely why some 72, 000 of them are scheduled to be evacuated from the city Sunday, as authorities seek to defuse and extricate the World War weapon. Reuters reports it is the largest peacetime evacuation in the country\u2019s history.",
        "A few days before Rex Tillerson\u2019s confirmation as secretary of state, Tillerson\u2019s Danish counterpart stood before an audience at a Copenhagen conference on the future of diplomacy and announced he would soon be naming a new ambassador. That would hardly be news \u2014 except this ambassador will not be heading to the U. S. or any other country. Instead, he or she will be serving as Denmark\u2019s chief diplomatic connection to the tech industry at large.",
        "It was June 1973. Claudia Maraviglia was working at a bank. Bill Dewane, a bank customer, had recently suffered a serious spinal cord injury that left him partially paralyzed. \u201dI was a teller, and you came in to cash a check and you had like, a denim shirt on, and it was partially open, and you had this nice long hair. You were so cute. And I remember I gave you too much money, \u2019cause I got so flustered,\u201d Claudia says. \u201dBut then you came back about an hour later, and you said, \u2019You gave me too much money.",
        "About a drive east of St. Louis is a complex of earthen mounds that once supported a prehistoric city of thousands. For a couple of hundred years, the city, called Cahokia, and several smaller like it flourished in the Mississippi River Valley. But by the time European colonizers set foot on American soil in the 15th century, these cities were already empty.",
        "It\u2019s basically three chords banged out on a piano for 4 minutes. No drums, no guitars, no samples. But then: there\u2019s her voice. Haunting. \u201dHere is your princess here is your horizon\u201d \u2014 Aldous Harding repeats the line as a mantra, as a truth, as a reality. It\u2019s as if the gift of life is right here, with all its beauty and its limitations. At least that\u2019s how I see it. Aldous told me in an email that \u201dI want the interpretation of \u2019Horizon\u2019 to be left up to the individual.",
        "U. S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, faced boos and jeers from Utahns in his home district during a rowdy town hall Thursday night in the suburbs outside Salt Lake City. More than 1, 000 people packed into the auditorium of Brighton High School for the noisy forum, with hundreds more stuck outside. Amid shouts and interruptions, Chaffetz was asked about everything from his controversial public lands bills to efforts to defund Planned Parenthood to President Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily prohibiting travelers of seven countries from entering the United States.",
        "Susan Collins has broken both of her ankles. She broke her left one when she was running in high heels to the Senate chamber because she so desperately refused to miss a vote. The Maine Republican has the voting streak in the Senate, by the way, after fellow Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa. \u201dHe has a longer streak, but I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s never missed a single vote,\u201d said Collins in a recent interview in her office, referring to Grassley missing votes early in his Senate career. Not that she\u2019s keeping track.",
        "President Trump met with a group of senators Thursday at the White House \u2014 six Democrats and four Republicans \u2014 in an attempt to build support for his Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch. Trump especially to two of the Democrats: Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. The president sat between them at lunch. \u201dToday we had a needed bipartisan discussion that will hopefully help our country by enabling the president and Congress to work together to get results,\u201d Heitkamp said afterward.",
        "President Trump recently described Frederick Douglass as \u201dan example of somebody who\u2019s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice.\u201d The president\u2019s muddled tense \u2014 it came out sounding as if the abolitionist were alive with a galloping Twitter following \u2014 provoked some mirth on social media. But the spotlight on one of America\u2019s great moral heroes is a welcome one.",
        "Jabar Mousa was 15 when he first met the Jewish settlers who would move near Dura his Palestinian village in the central West Bank. It was 1977, and he and two friends were walking on a nearby hill. That\u2019s where they saw a group of young men in yarmulkes. \u201dWe stop and asked these young men, who are you?\u201d says Mousa, now 56. \u201dAnd they said, \u2019We are students of the yeshiva. We study in a school in Beit El.",
        "The Trump administration continued to play loose with facts in week three. President Trump took aim at one of his favorite targets \u2014 the media \u2014 accusing them of not reporting terrorist attacks. The very list of attacks the White House released hours later contradicted those claims. Trump again cited incorrect statistics on the country\u2019s murder rate, though a day later he did use the right numbers. Press secretary Sean Spicer had his own \u201dBowling Green massacre\u201d moment when he referred multiple times to a terrorist attack in Atlanta that never happened.",
        "It\u2019s not often you get a chance to come with that person who made a nasty comment about you on Facebook. But one interviewee from our Kitchen Table Series got a chance to do that. Jamie Ruppert of White Haven, Pa. was featured in a story that aired in January. She\u2019s a swing voter and like much of Luzerne County, where she lives, Ruppert switched from voting Democratic in the past to casting her ballot for Trump in 2016. When the story was posted on NPR\u2019s Facebook page it received more than 6000 comments.",
        "A restaurant in New York City debuted a new dish last week that\u2019s getting a lot of buzz. It\u2019s a burger made entirely from plants. This isn\u2019t just another veggie knock off. The rap is that this burger looks, cooks and even bleeds like the real thing. The Impossible Burger, as it\u2019s known, is the culmination of a dream for Pat Brown. For 25 years, Brown was a professor at Stanford University. He was one of the stars in his field, studying a range of biomedical topics. \u201dGenetics and genomics . ..",
        "Federal immigration authorities launched a new wave of raids and other actions in several states over the past five days aimed at sweeping up people who are in this country illegally. It\u2019s not known how many people were rounded up across the country, but immigration advocates say they\u2019ve received reports of raids in California, Texas, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, New York and Kansas. The ICE operations are the first to take place since President Trump issued his Jan. 26 executive order expanding the priorities for enforcement.",
        "Americans are used to the hurly burly of political and legal debate. But presidents historically have been careful about criticizing individual judges or their motives. However, President Donald Trump tweeted and railed against the judges who have ordered a temporary halt to his ban on people entering or returning to the U. S. from seven mostly Muslim countries. The president\u2019s rhetoric left many lawyers and historians on both the right and left aghast, or at least scratching their heads.",
        "If you just so happened to crane your neck skyward at night this week \u2014 or better yet, if you craned your neck downward to look in your telescope \u2014 you probably caught quite a show. The night sky has been busy lately: A full moon, known by the Farmer\u2019s Almanac as a \u201dSnow Moon\u201d since it happened in February, took center stage on Friday night. Nevertheless, it still got over shadowed by Earth \u2014 literally, as a matter of fact.",
        "When President George W. Bush overhauled immigration rules after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, he received broad public support, bipartisan backing in Congress and a cooperative judiciary. The U. S. was a country genuinely fearful of more terrorism. Contrast that moment with President Trump\u2019s temporary immigration freeze, which shares similarities with Bush\u2019s actions. Yet Trump\u2019s executive order has inspired widespread protests, congressional opposition and multiple legal challenges, including Thursday\u2019s defeat in a federal appeals court. Why the radically different response today? By most yardsticks, the U. S."
