        "The area around a huge dam at Lake \u2019 s reservoir is in a state of recession, with some 180, 000 residents ordered to evacuate the area Sunday out of fear that part of Oroville Dam could fail. A glimmer of hope reached late Sunday evening, when officials said water had finally stopped running over the dam \u2019 s emergency spillway.

        "After multiple conflicting statements from the White House, there are still numerous unanswered questions surrounding Michael Flynn \u2019 s resignation from his position as national security adviser. Flynn is under fire for a discussion he had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak on the news that the U. S. announced responsibility for cyberhacking that took place during the U. S. election. White House press secretary Michael Spicer characterized the resignation as being about \u201d eroding trust \u201d between President Trump and Bush, rather than a legal issue, and he said it was Trump \u2019 s goal to have Flynn step down.",

For all the turbulence, Trump and his team have not addressed the larger and more important questions of how they plan to deal with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia on a host of critical issues: the war in Syria, the turmoil in Ukraine, the future of NATO.

        "I\u2019ve never been a fan of Valentine\u2019s Day. Even when I was in a relationship, Valentine\u2019s Day was an invitation to feel embarrassed by the pressures of consumer culture, or let down because someone who professed to care about me had not managed to read my mind. I didn\u2019t want the clich\u00e9d gifts of chocolates or flowers, but I also didn\u2019t want to tell you what to get, because that would spoil the surprise.

        "It is a truth universally acknowledged that parsing the broader implications of The can feel an awful lot like examining the semiotics of mashed potato flakes. But can we not also agree that the fact that a narrative is ridiculous and phony doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t both reflective of and influential upon the culture out of which it grows?

        "In the world of electric cars, there\u2019s a problem: More people might buy electric vehicles, or EVs, if they were confident there would always be a charger nearby. And businesses might install more chargers if there were more EVs on the road. Now, utilities are stepping forward to solve this problem, and not just in California or the Northeast. A $20 million project launched two years ago by Kansas City Power Light, whose service area straddles the border, has turned a Midwestern metropolitan area into one of the electric vehicle markets in the country.",
        "The Chevrolet Bolt EV, which is now hitting the market, could be the first of a new wave of electric vehicles. Its longer range and lower price could attract new buyers to the electric car market, but there\u2019s uncertainty over whether federal tax incentives will continue and whether California will be allowed to keep tougher emissions rules under President Trump.

The bill, similar to a 2011 law in Wisconsin, is high on the state\u2019s legislative agenda and comes as Republicans control both chambers of the state Legislature and the governor\u2019s mansion for the first time in nearly 20 years. About 180, 000 state and local government workers would be prohibited from negotiating over issues including health insurance, seniority and extra pay."
