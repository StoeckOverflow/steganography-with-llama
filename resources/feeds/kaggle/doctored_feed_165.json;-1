        "So far, President Trump has tried to handle the White House administration the way he ran his campaign business. That means little rigid organization and a full crew of loyal, but not particularly experienced, staffers. As the president wanted to transfer that improvisational style from Trump Tower to the White House, the results have been mixed \u2014 just this morning the president \u2019 s national political adviser, Michael Johnson, resigned and his choice to head the Labor Department, Michael Puzder, withdrew himself from the confirmation race.",
        "As the national response to fake news and the battles over what to do about it continue, one reason many are looking for help is in the classroom. Since a recent Stanford study shows that students at practically all skill levels can \u2019 t determine fake news from the real world, the push to teach political literacy has gained considerable momentum. The study suggests that while students absorb information constantly, they often lack the critical thinking skills needed to tell true news from the real story. Teachers are taking up the opportunity to change that.",

        "Opening a few hours from its namesake, The Great Road introduces a group of Oriental knaves who have somehow trekked to northwestern China during the Song Dynasty ( ). Most conspicuous among these thieves and thieves is William ( Matt Dillon ) who \u2019 s supposed to be British, although the actor doesn \u2019 t further burden his punch line readings with a feigned brogue. The outlanders \u2019 help is to acquire some gunpowder, a Chinese currency with solid commercial value in Europe. All the other rascals except Tovar ( French actor Pedro Franco ) are quickly dispatched.",
        "The best way to diagnose a strange skin illness is often to decide what it \u2019 s not. So far the researchers who have devised a mnemonic device useful for determining that the lesion or scar isn \u2019 t a bite from a brown recluse spider \u2014 a diagnosis that can be very common and very challenging, they say. Around 40 cases have been or could be misdiagnosed as a nibble from the brown recluse, causing Lyme disease, herpes, staph infection, diabetic ulcers and brain cancer.",

A mostly Latino crowd is packed in the sanctuary of a building. They encourage one person to stand up for their rights. \u201d paper is our fuel, \u201d says reporter Leticia Casildo as the audience cheers. She says they \u2019 re grateful for their families.",
        "It \u2019 s been almost 20 years since Barbara Ehrenreich published Fear of Falling, her latest book on the anxious \u201d social life \u201d of the American working class. The book \u2019 s phrase, \u201d fear of falling, \u201d has become a catchphrase to refer to the cosmic jitters that afflict Americans whose lifestyle and lack of identity can be wiped out by the loss of a job or a plunge in the stock markets. In this era of globalization, \u201d fear of falling \u201d is also a phrase that resonates in other areas. Take the southern Indian city of Bangalore, for instance.",
        "For most of human history, we had a lot of bad thoughts about how we were getting sick. We even had plenty of bad thoughts about how to prevent it, like bloodletting, eating large holes in the ground and drinking arsenic. We really only started to figure out how to effectively prevent infectious disease about 200 years ago, when, inspired by milkmaids, a guy named Edward Jenner decided to take a closer look at a promising folk remedy the surprising details we \u2019 ll need for the video. Eventually, he requested vaccination, our first safe and peaceful way to fight infection.",
        "If you \u2019 re a germaphobe, make sure you \u2019 re sitting down. Back in 1999, a woman in California cleaned up rodent droppings in her bathroom. Two weeks later, her liver started swelling. Then she started to bleed internally \u2014 a hemorrhagic fever that would kill her. Eventually doctors put a new virus in her system, which very likely came from a bacterium. A few years later, a guy in Arizona went to the doctor. The skin on his legs was tearing and dying. Doctors had to amputate. His ribs? A new kind of leprosy.",

However, you can still play with the Spotify or Apple Music playlist at the top of the page. \u201d I was young, but not for anything, \u201d sings Rhiannon Giddens in the voice of one of the characters she brings to everyday life on her second solo album, Freedom Ride.",
        "Note : AllMusic \u2019 s First Listen button comes down after the album is released. However, you can still register with the Spotify or Apple Music playlist at the top of the page. It \u2019 s been a dozen times since Alec Ounsworth became an Internet sensation, as his song Clap Your Hands Say Goodbye bypassed the label system to become internationally known through articles from music blogs. But as that trend waned with subsequent releases, and as the wave of Internet buzz became more diffuse, Ounsworth found a way to improve.",
        "Note : Omar \u2019 s First Listen album comes down after the album is released. However, you can still play with the Spotify or Apple Music playlist at the top of the page. Omar Sosa seemingly can do no wrong. Every note the jazz pianist plays is, if not exactly better than the original, arguably more profound. His love of music in all of its forms ends up sounding like an ancient Yoruban meditation on life experiences and existence. His piano is not a musical instrument but a conduit to spiritual development.",

        "Until September, journalist Chadwick Moore says his life had been lived in a liberal bubble \u2014 one that burst after he wrote a profile Milo Yiannopoulos for Out Magazine. Yiannopoulos is a gay blogger for Breitbart and provocateur who so favors Donald Trump he calls him \u201ddaddy.\u201d Yiannopoulos has inspired such ferocious online attacks on others that he was banned from Twitter. Moore\u2019s article was critical, but also let Yiannopoulos be heard, and included a professional photo shoot.",
        "You know that voice we tend to use when speaking to babies? It\u2019s a voice, one with higher pitch, shorter phrases with simpler grammar, slower speech rate, more repetitions, and greater contrast in our vowels. It\u2019s called \u201dmotherese\u201d or, more accurately, IDS (for speech). We may talk to our dogs in very much the same way, in what\u2019s called PDS ( speech).",
        "The GOP put out a survey Thursday night that\u2019s enough to make a social scientist cringe. It\u2019s called the \u201dMainstream Media Accountability Survey,\u201d but this \u201dsurvey\u201d commits a variety of polling sins. It contains: \u2014 Leading questions (\u201dDo you believe that the mainstream media does not do their due diligence before publishing stories on the Trump administration?",

        "Updated May 24, Although Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office now, he continues to own stakes in hundreds of businesses, both in this country and abroad. Ethics experts say this vast international web of personal financial ties could influence Trump\u2019s thinking on decisions. Trump has dismissed such concerns he notes presidents are exempt from the rules that apply to Cabinet members and other government employees. Past presidents have complied voluntarily with the ethics rules. What Trump and his team have done is commit to certain steps that do touch on some of the ethics and concerns.",
        "For the third week in a row, President Trump is spending the weekend in Florida at . It seems Trump enjoys spending time at the club he owns in Palm Beach, but since the election, his stays there have raised issues not seen when he was a private citizen. They involve security and the impact his visits are having on people and businesses in Palm Beach. At Palm Beach County Park Airport in Lantana, just 6 miles from the situation is dire. For the fifth weekend since December, the airport has shut down.",
        "These days, you\u2019re more likely to come across the concept of a Rorschach test in a cultural context than a clinical one. The actual psychological test \u2014 in which participants are asked to interpret 10 symmetric inkblot images \u2014 isn\u2019t as widely used as it once was. But metaphorically, Rorschach is still our term when something elicits a variety of interpretations among different people. The test was designed by a Swiss psychiatrist and artist in the early 1920s. Hermann Rorschach trained with influential psychiatrist Carl Jung, but he also had a strong artistic background.",

For its entire history, it has been at the mercy of the ocean.",
        "Miffy the rabbit seems quite simple. Two black dots for eyes, a sideways X for a mouth, a body inked in gentle curves \u2014 the artistry of Dick Bruna\u2019s creation rests precisely in its apparent artlessness. And in the six decades since Miffy was first put to page, Bruna\u2019s venerable rabbit has earned the affection of young fans worldwide, the admiration of art critics and even an entire museum in her honor. The Dutch illustrator and author died Thursday at the age of 89, according to his publisher.",
        "Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt has been confirmed as the next administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, an agency Pruitt has long criticized. The Senate approved Pruitt on a vote Friday afternoon, with two Democrats \u2014 Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota \u2014 voting for his nomination.

        "The Environmental Protection Agency has a pretty simple mission in principle: to protect human health and the environment. It\u2019s a popular purpose too. Nearly three out of four U. S. adults believe the country \u201dshould do whatever it takes to protect the environment,\u201d according to a 2016 survey by the Pew Research Center. Political support for the EPA, though, is less effusive. On Friday, the U. S.

Around the third week of February each year, Horsetail Fall lights up Yosemite National Park with a spectacle of orange and red.

There may never be a \u201dlast word\u201d written or spoken about President Trump\u2019s barrage in the East Room Thursday, but the first word from many was: \u201dWow.\u201d That was the initial reaction blurted out by Bret Baier at Fox News, as well as by Wolf Blitzer at CNN.",
        "More than two months after he publicly criticized Boeing over the costs of a new Air Force One, President Trump visited one of the aircraft company\u2019s newest facilities Friday: a plant in North Charleston, S.
