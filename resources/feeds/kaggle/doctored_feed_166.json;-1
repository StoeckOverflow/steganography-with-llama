        "One of the most joyful things I \u2019 ve heard in years came courtesy of the singer Betsayda Machado and her group La Parranda El Clavo, who made their New York City debut at the annual globalFEST Ball in January. They root their unique politically pointed songs with the sounds of their heritage \u2014 creating intricate African polyrhythms and percussion, as well as singing \u2014 rhythms mixed with close harmonies that evoke an urgency.",
        "The first sign of trouble was the monkeys getting dead in the forest. Then pigs started getting hungry and dying, too. Brazil is in the midst of its worst yellow fever outbreak since the 1940s, when the state started mass vaccination and mosquito eradication efforts to thwart the virus. The first symptoms in this current outbreak were made in December among Indians living in rural areas of the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, an agricultural region just north of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.",
        "Republicans handled the scene well : Many constituents flood local town halls, take over health care and other public issues. It \u2019 s that energy that came eight years later, birthing the Tea Party Revolution and helping the GOP take back Congress in the 2010 election. But now, they \u2019 re finding themselves on the receiving end instead of the giving end. Last week more than 1, 000 people met House Oversight Committee chairman Jason Chaffetz at his town hall in suburban Utah.",
        "A federal district court says physicians in Florida must be licensed to discuss guns with their physician, striking down portions of a state law that restricts what physicians can say to patients about firearm usage. In a decision, the full Court of the 11th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the act, known as the Privacy of Firearm Owners act, violates the Fifth Amendment rights of individuals.",
        "The 1987 comedy Seven O \u2019 Clock High, about the showdown between a nerdy newspaper reporter and a bully who looked like a has gained a cult following over the years for cutting against the backdrop of the typical \u2019 80s high school fare. Stylishly directed by Peter Joanou, who made a name for himself doing music videos for U2, the film plays as a teenage twist on Martin Scorsese \u2019 s After Hours, another popular comedy about a hapless weakling being put through the wringer.",
        "The action in the U. S. school system is overwhelmingly partisan. But the federal government, and the legislature, have an important hand in identifying issues that touch away \u2014 from civil rights to new programs of study. We look at the records of some of President Eisenhower \u2019 s key appointees to see how they might affect education in the years to come.",
        "A news article publishes a story that a certain politician dismisses as \u201d fake news. \u201d Sounds familiar, right? But in this case, there \u2019 s a twist. The Rocky Junction Daily newspaper in Colorado is accusing Colorado Sen. Ray Baker of defamation and threatening to sue. If confirmed, legal experts suggest it would be the first accusation of its kind, potentially offering a legal definition for what is actually fake news and what is not. The scandal began with an opinion article in the newspaper supporting a measure that would give historians and others greater access to public records.",
        "In a series of televised interviews, President Donald Trump \u2019 s longtime staff physician Dr. Richard N. Bornstein told The New York Times that our army commander in chief has what amounts to a pretty unremarkable medical knowledge. Like about a quarter of modern adults, Trump is on a statin for low cholesterol. He also takes a mild baby aspirin for heart cancer, an occasional antibiotic for rosacea, a skin patch, and Propecia, a pill to promote brain growth.",
        "On a clear, calm winter evening, the sun begins to set at Green Lake Farm outside Jewell, Iowa, and Kevin Dietzel calls his 15 dairy cows to head home. \u201d Come on! \u201d he hollers in a singsong tone. \u201d Come on! \u201d Brown dairy cows and black brown cows trot across the empty field and, in groups of six, are ushered into the small milking area. Unstable milk prices that rarely get very high have prompted most dairies to grow their herds to make increases on volume.",
        "Updated at 3 : 50 p. m. ET, Many only know Norma McCorvey by a name that \u2019 s not hers. Under the name Jane Roe, McCorvey became the central figure of Roe v. Wade, the famous 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in the U. S. But in the decade that followed, the complex issue came to serve as a symbol at times for both sides of the social divide over abortion laws.",
        "Jan. 22, 2013, marked the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. But the conventional assumption that the court \u2019 s decision signaled the beginning of a contentious battle that still rages today is not the case, particularly to those on both sides of the dispute. Tom Taylor, executive director of the National Committee for a New Life Amendment, has been active in the effort since the late 1960s. He says the present movement dates back to the 1950s, when some radical \u201d began urging the overturn or repeal of existing laws \u201d banning abortion.",
        "Friday afternoon, President Trump turned to Twitter to deliver two of his favorite insults to CNN : \u201d The FAKE NEWS media ( failing @ nytimes, @ NBCNews, @ CBS, @ CBS, @ CNN ) is not my friend, it is the enemy of the American government! \u201d he wrote. It \u2019 s a phrase President Trump has now tweeted 15 times this day ( 10 times in all caps ). He repeated the phrase seven times in his Thursday news segment. Anyone who has followed the message knows this isn \u2019 t what \u201d fake ad \u201d meant just a few months back.",
        "Iran tested a ballistic missile barely a week into Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. North Korea then shot off a missile of its own. A Russian warship has been hanging out about 30 miles off the U. S. East Coast, and Moscow\u2019s fighter jets recently buzzed a U. S. warship in the Black Sea. President Trump has been in office less than a month, and U. S. adversaries have already tested him on several fronts.",
        "With Secretary Betsy DeVos rolling up her sleeves at the Education Department and, at one point this week, joining Donald Trump at the White House to talk with educators and parents, Washington, D. C. is making a lot of education news these days. For those of you struggling to keep up, the NPR Ed Team is trying something new: a weekly recap of the latest national education news. Editor\u2019s Note: This story was updated Saturday afternoon to reflect DeVos\u2019 interview with Townhall and the subsequent response by Jefferson Academy in Washington, D. C.",
        "Astronomers are offering the general public a opportunity: the chance to discover a new planet in our solar system. Many astronomers now think there may be a massive, undiscovered planet lurking in the far reaches of our solar system. Right now, however, the existence of this planet is theoretical. So the hunt is on to actually capture an image of it. The obvious way to look for the new planet is to point large telescopes at the patch of sky where theory says it ought to be.",
        "After years of declining numbers, hate crimes against and Pacific Islanders are rising exponentially. A report from the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations found that crimes targeting tripled in that county between 2014 and 2015. In addition, the FBI found that the number of hate crimes against Muslim communities rose dramatically between 2014 and 2015 (67 percent). That\u2019s the biggest increase of any other group listed in the Hate Crimes Report. However, national statistics on hate crimes against people who fall under the AAPI label are still scanty.",
        "Editor\u2019s note: This story contains language that may be offensive to some readers. Harassment, threats and intimidation of minorities and immigrants spiked nationwide after President Trump\u2019s election in November. Comprehensive statistics are hard to come by, but officials and watch groups say incidents remain higher than usual more than three months after Election Day. Massachusetts is among the many states that have seen such a spike. \u201dThere was one night, where my parents and I were walking out of a department store,\u201d recalls Nadia Butt, 36, of Danvers, Mass. a suburb north of Boston.",
        "Can you capture the energy of a city in just one image? That\u2019s the idea behind Metropolis, a book of photos of the world\u2019s megacities by Dutch photographer Martin Roemers. The images illustrate the rapid rise of global urbanization. In 1994, there were 14 cities with a population over 10 million. In 2016, there were 29, according to the U. N. Roemers was inspired to tell this story after going on a trip to Bombay many years ago. \u201dI was struck by what I saw. It was so crowded, chaotic. There\u2019s a smell, there\u2019s a noise.",
        "Few topics send the media into a panic like the idea of hookup culture on college campuses. But are college students actually having more sex than their parents did a generation ago? Research suggests the answer is no. Lisa Wade, a sociologist at Occidental College, says something has changed, though: In today\u2019s hookup culture, developing an emotional attachment to a casual sex partner is one of the biggest breaches of social norms. For her new book, American Hookup: The New Culture of Sex on Campus, Wade spent 5 years investigating hookup culture on American colleges and universities.",
        "There\u2019s a bulletin board at the front of the band room at Spring Lake Park High covered in portraits of the composers who wrote this year\u2019s music selection. The bulletin board isn\u2019t new \u2014 it\u2019s there every year. What\u2019s new are the faces: Instead of primarily white men, there are faces of women and composers of color. This is intentional. The band directors at Spring Lake Park, outside of St. Paul, Minn.",
        "Big Little Lies, which begins Sunday on HBO, is a miniseries that begins with a murder scene, and investigation, in the oceanside town of Monterey. It\u2019s a drama, and HBO made the first six available for preview. Even after watching all of them, I still don\u2019t know the identity of the murderer \u2014 or, for that matter, the victim. But that\u2019s on purpose. Based on the novel by Liane Moriarty, Big Little Lies is a study in motivation, conflict and, most of all, secrets.",
        "Some Republicans looking to scrap the Affordable Care Act say monthly health insurance premiums need to be lower for the individuals who have to buy insurance on their own. One way to do that, GOP leaders say, would be to return to the use of what are called insurance pools. But critics say even some of the most successful pools that operated before the advent of Obamacare were very expensive for patients enrolled in the plans, and for the people who subsidized them \u2014 which included state taxpayers and people with health insurance.",
        "There are a lot of children playing outside in eastern Mosul. They run around the front yards of their houses, chasing each other through the alleyways, as their parents sit on plastic chairs keeping \u2014 at most \u2014 half an eye on them. At the boys\u2019 school, Mustafa Salem, 13, says this freedom is new. During the 2 years that ISIS controlled his neighborhood, he was rarely allowed to leave the house. \u201dIt wasn\u2019t good, there was no school, nothing,\u201d he said.",
        "Polar bears aren\u2019t the only beloved Arctic animal threatened by climate change. Scientists believe reindeer are at risk as a warming world makes their main winter food source disappear. But reindeer on one Alaskan island are surprising researchers. And that surprise doesn\u2019t just come from the fact that the reindeer are hard to spot. On St. Paul Island, Lauren Divine of the EcoSystem Conservation Office was not having luck seeing a herd of 400 reindeer, even on this treeless island with tundra as far as the eye can see.",
        "What a week it was for Donald Trump. As if everyone didn\u2019t know this already \u2014 Donald Trump is governing just the way he campaigned. He\u2019s a band with an impulsive, management style. As his former rival Jeb Bush correctly predicted way back in the primaries, he\u2019s the \u201dchaos candidate\u201d and now the \u201dchaos president.\u201d While it\u2019s too soon to subscribe to some of the hyperventilating headlines about a \u201dcrisis\u201d in the West Wing, there\u2019s no doubt Trump\u2019s has been the most chaotic start to any administration in modern times.",
        "It has been of a century since President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066. The order, issued just over two months after Japan\u2019s surprise attack at Pearl Harbor, gave the U. S. military the ability to designate areas \u201dfrom which any or all persons may be excluded.\u201d There was no mention of any particular ethnic or racial group anywhere in the order. Nevertheless, the implications were quickly quite clear: Not even a week passed before people of Japanese descent were being ordered to leave their homes in California.",
        "This weekend marks 75 years since President Roosevelt\u2019s executive order that sent to internment camps. Roy Ebihara and his wife, Aiko, were children then, and both were held in camps with their families. At StoryCorps, Roy told Aiko about what happened in his hometown of Clovis, N. M. in the weeks just before the executive order was issued. \u201dA sheriff and two plainclothesmen barged into the house and searched for what they called \u2019contrabands.\u2019 They took out my brother\u2019s box camera, my father\u2019s shortwave radio and they took the ax to it and chopped everything up,\u201d Roy says.",
        "At 98, Riichi Fuwa doesn\u2019t remember his Social Security number, but he remembers this: \u201d19949. That was my number the government gave me,\u201d he said. \u201d19949. You were more number than name.\u201d That was the number that Fuwa was assigned when he was 24 years old, soon after he was forced off his family\u2019s farm in Bellingham, Wash. and incarcerated at the Tule Lake camp, just south of the Oregon border in California\u2019s Modoc County. years ago today, on Feb. 19, 1942, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed Executive Order No.",
        "I was worried that I might not be able to stick to an intermittent fasting schedule during my vacation in Mexico. It turns out, it was a breeze. Because I was sick. It started on the plane ride to Cozumel, a tingle in my throat and then the telltale sign that illness was imminent: three sneezes in a row. A clogged nose, a slight fever and a general feeling of malaise came over me after my third dive into the electric blue waters of the Caribbean.",
        "The chief of Facebook made an ambitious announcement last week, though it would have been easy to miss. It came Thursday afternoon \u2014 about the same time that President Trump held his news conference. While the icon is a genius at capturing our attention, the technology leader\u2019s words may prove to be more relevant to our lives, and more radical. Mark Zuckerberg posted a nearly essay to his page, entitled \u201dBuilding Global Community.\u201d Many are calling it a \u201dmanifesto.\u201d His ambitions are global and his tone, altruistic."
