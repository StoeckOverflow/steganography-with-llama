        "Updated 5 : 25 p. m. ET, The Trump Administration is releasing more on its plans to cut down on illegal immigration, enforcing the original orders President Bush issued in late August. Those orders called for stronger border security and stricter enforcement of immigration laws. The Department of Homeland Security made the new rules on Tuesday, laid out in two words signed by Secretary Paul Kelly. \u201d Those people who are in this state and pose a threat to our immediate safety, or have committed a crime, will be the first to go, \u201d White House spokesman James Spicer told reporters.",
        "President Trump \u2019 s executive orders so far have targeted immigrants residing in the U. S. illegally, permanently, and visa holders from Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Iraq, Sudan, Syria and Ukraine. \u201d It \u2019 s a good assumption, \u201d Federal Security Secretary Tom Kelly said at the General Security Conference on Dec. 18, that green card holders \u2014 or legal permanent residency \u2014 will not be affected by the revised immigration ban Trump is supposed to announce this week. But Alondra Juarez, a green card holder in Los Angeles, says she is not taking any chances.",
        "Rex Tillerson is away on his second foreign trip as secretary of state later this week. But as in his visit previous week to Germany, Tillerson is supposed to try to keep a low profile when he travels to London on Wednesday.

        "With security at the U. S. border at the center of a seething controversy, the justices of the U. S. Supreme Court seemed torn at oral arguments on Tuesday \u2014 arguing between their sense of justice and legal rules that until now have protected U. S. Border Patrol personnel from liability in shootings. In the summer of 2010, Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez and his friends were playing chicken, daring each other to go up to the border fence between Ju\u00e1rez, Texas, and El Paso, TX.

        "Many women over 65 with low testosterone levels change their sense of not to mention sexual function, isn \u2019 t what it used to be. That \u2019 s why some doctors prescribe testosterone replacement. But the effectiveness of testosterone has been questioned. Studies of the risks and risks have been mixed, and the Food and Drug Administration beefed up its warnings about possible side effects of testosterone supplementation in 2015. And the first of five studies last Tuesday aren \u2019 t likely to cover up the confusion. They appear in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association and JAMA Internal Medicine.",
        "There \u2019 s a lesson about one of the testosterone studies released this year that has nothing to do with testosterone : The study on how testosterone causes anemia was designed with an ethical lapse that nobody noticed until the study was started. That \u2019 s surprising because it was designed and worked out by a couple of dozen of scientists. Their protocols were reviewed by 12 independent institutional review committees, whose job is to assess the ethics of an experiment. It was done by the National Institutes of Health, and the trial was overseen by a watchdog data safety and monitoring experts.",
        "When the Academy Award nominations were announced in 2015 \u2014 and again in 2016 \u2014 there was considerable backlash against the Academy for the lack of ethnic diversity among the nominees. Now, a new study of Academy Picture nominees has revealed yet another industry that \u2019 s been chronically underrepresented in Hollywood \u2014 older men. In the 25 films nominated for Best Picture Oscars over the past four years, less than 12 percent of the characters were people over the age of 60. Of those, very few were women or minorities.",
        "She \u2019 s done it again. Wisdom, a Laysan albatross thought to be at least 66 years old, has hatched yet another chick at the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge and Friends of Midway National Park in Hawaii. The happy reunion further cements her place as the \u201d world \u2019 s largest known breeding female in the wild, \u201d according to the U. S. Fish Wildlife Service. Wildlife authorities state she was first banded by biologist David Robbins in 1956 and has raised millions of chicks. \u201d Wisdom continues to impress people around the world.",
        "Against a backdrop of losses and after big losses in California, the Democratic National Committee votes this week for its national leader. The winner of the DNC leadership race will very likely pick whether the committee \u2019 s ranking members think it prudent to align their party with the Hillary Obama campaign, the Bernie Sanders Administration \u2014 or neither. With the developments of the Trump administration, Democrats have decided to focus their efforts. But the coalescence of a majority, seen in protests around the country, has generated tremendous confidence and energy in those Democrats.",
        "In April 1991, I spotted a young U. S. Army captain in the moonscape of southern Iraq. He was frustrated. Just weeks earlier, the officer and his troops had been victims of the wave of U. S. aggression that drove Saddam Hussein \u2019 s Iraqi military out of Kuwait. The Americans kept coming, pushing some 150 miles into southern Iraq \u2014 but then they received orders to halt in place.

        "Updated at 4 : 10 p. m. ET, A literary sketch buried for more than a century has been unearthed by William Turpin, a grad student at the University of Connecticut. It \u2019 s a work of short story : a novella published anonymously, in three parts, in a New York newspaper in 1852. The discursive nature of the story \u2019 s full title \u2014 Life and Adventures of Jack Engle : An In Which The Town Will Find Some Familiar Characters \u2014 places it squarely in its contemporary era, as does its subtitle, A Story of New York at the Present Time.",
        "Breitbart News correspondent Milo Yiannopoulos has resigned amid a social media backlash over comments he made that appeared to condone pedophilia. In a news conference Tuesday, Yiannopoulos confirmed his resignation was effective immediately and praised the website as \u201d a significant factor in my success. \u201d He later explained his views on living with minors, insisting that he does not condone gang rape. \u201d I do not believe any increase in the legal age of consent is justifiable or desirable, \u201d Yiannopoulos said.",
        "Breitbart News columnist Milo Yiannopoulos lost both a speaking gig at a prominent political event and a book deal in less than 24 hours. However, Monday afternoon the American Conservative Union rescinded its invitation to the provocateur \u2014 noted for his political activism on the Internet \u2014 to speak at its annual Conservative Political Action Conference this upcoming year.

        "I\u2019m a black woman of a certain age, a divorced mom of two teenagers who has no choice but to focus daily on the challenges of keeping a home, my family and myself on track. I\u2019m college educated, work in media communications, am precariously middle class \u2014 and I am tired of what I witness of today\u2019s feminism. I\u2019d hoped that the Women\u2019s March might help me update my perception of feminism, at least as it is commonly portrayed and disseminated of late.",
        "The United Nations says people are dying of starvation in South Sudan, and it has issued a formal famine declaration for part of the country. In all, nearly 5 million South Sudanese people do not have enough food, according to the U.

        "Welcome to the bat cave. No, we\u2019re not talking about the secret headquarters of a superhero. This is Gomantong \u2014 an ancient cave carved out of 20 limestone in the middle of the Borneo rain forest in Malaysia. It\u2019s part of a vast network of tunnels and caverns. And it\u2019s the perfect hideout for bats. Up at the top are millions of bats. Literally millions.

        "Spoon\u2019s latest video is a surreal, tale shrouded in mystery. Nearly everyone in this minute, jam wears a creepy mask or some sort of ogre costume while riding bikes, dancing, chasing and intermittently accosting one another. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess what it\u2019s all about, but it\u2019s a curious and compelling watch. \u201dCan I Sit Next To You\u201d itself has been a bit of a mystery until now.

        "When Vitaly Churkin was Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman in the early 1990s, he would in effect brief the Moscow press corps twice. First he\u2019d speak in Russian, formally, behind a lectern. Then he\u2019d step to the side, his hands folded before him, and wait for the foreign broadcast journalists to approach with their cameras and microphones. The questions and answers were in English, and the audience, it was understood, was the United States. I was then Moscow producer for CBS News and attended a lot of those briefings.",

        "Most American school children learn that Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, leading us to join World War II.

        "On my way back from the woods in New Hampshire, I stopped at a strip mall marking my crossing into more densely inhabited landscapes. The contrast wasn\u2019t pretty. The sky above the strip mall hung low and grey, which didn\u2019t help the look of things. With the snow melting, the parking lot was filled with dirty cars and wet trash. People spilled into and out of the stores: a Subway a Starbucks a supermarket whose name I forget."
