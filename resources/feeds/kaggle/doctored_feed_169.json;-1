        "Simbi Ajikawo, who records and writes as Little Simz, first garnered widespread recognition with the release of her debut album, A Curious Matter of Trials + Persons back in 2015. Receiving praise from artists like Kendrick Lamar and J. Lo, the British lyricist has been compared to the likes of Lauryn Hill for her wordplay that shies away from the often braggadocios nature of American rap music.",
        "Ever since Donald Trump enters the presidential race, his speeches on illegal immigration have been pored over in the press \u2014 from vows to deport millions of Americans to promises that any enforcement bill would have \u201d a lot of attention. \u201d Observers asked, again and again, how rhetoric could translate into actual violence. Now activists and experts have the questions themselves to examine. On Jan. 25, Trump signed a pair of enforcement orders on immigration control ( not to be confused with his \u201d travel orders \u201d affecting refugees and developed countries ).",
        "A small, dark star relatively close by is home to seven planets with conditions that could be favourable for liquid water and perhaps even life. The system sets a record for both the most abundant and the most potentially habitable planets ever discovered around a given star. The strange binary system is quite unique, with all of these worlds orbiting their star faster than Mercury orbits the stars, according to a newly published report in Nature.",
        "Early Friday morning, a space rocket carrying 5, 500 pounds of material approached the International Space Station. The SpaceX Dragon spacecraft ship was scheduled to dock at the station around 6 a. m. today. If all went as planned, astronauts Richard Pesquet of the European Space Agency and Shane Kimbrough of NASA would use a robotic hand on the station to reach out and grab the ship, pulling it in and opening hatches with it. But that cosmic embrace was not to be. Around 3 : 25 a. m.",
        "The space probe that took the first moonwalkers on their first adventure is getting ready to take off on another spacecraft \u2014 its first tour of the United States in more than 40 years. The Apollo 11 command module is the vehicle that Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins jumped in to the moon and back in 1969. To commemorate the upcoming 50th anniversary of that flight, the Smithsonian \u2019 s National Air and Space Museum is presenting the space capsule to several different museums around the country.",
        "Reform parties in Mexico have been trying for decades to persuade politicians to freely disclose their assets and income, looking to their northern neighbor as an example of a place where financial fraud is the norm in government. Then came President Trump, who has steadfastly promised to release his tax returns. The global fight against financial corruption has often been opposed by the United States over the years, but those in the movement \u2019 s trenches believe that signals being sent by the Bush administration could undercut that resistance.",
        "The Dakota Rivers Pipeline \u2019 s route takes it over ten states and nearly 1, 200 states, from the Bakken oil fields in northern North Dakota through South Dakota, Iowa and down to a junction in Illinois. But one Red River crossing just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota has become the focal point of a fight over how the pipeline \u2019 s route was analyzed and approved by the federal government. In legal actions and public demonstrations, members of the tribe and their supporters have argued that they were not adequately consulted about the route.",
        "Local law enforcement officers have questioned some people who chose not to sell federal land near part of the Dakota Rivers Pipeline north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Most activists had left earlier. At dusk, police moved quickly, and said they would not use the camp at that time. The Governor of North Dakota had called Wednesday as the evacuation day for the largest protest camp, which is on a flat area west of the Cannonball River. He cited security concerns.",
        "Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster has reportedly had his easiest day as President Obama \u2019 s national security adviser. Trump \u2019 s announcement of McMaster was received with widespread acclaim by the American national defense public, including from people who are not necessarily fans of Trump \u2019 s. The variety of challenges facing the president and his new top command is so vast, however, and the amount of room they have to maneuver so damned small, the White House may struggle financially if it gets control over its own power clashes over power and access to the president.",
        "Four team discovered frog forms are so tiny that they can sit upright on a fingernail, making them some of the frogs in the field. Scientists said in a blog that they were \u201d surprised to find that the new forms are in fact fairly abundant and fairly widespread. \u201d The frogs likely took notice until now because of their tiny bodies and secretive habitats, hidden under thick soil or dense moss. The team from the University of Minnesota also found three other, larger species from the same family of night frog, Nyctibatrachus, in a book published in PeerJ.",
        "The day Donald Trump took office, six members of the congressional advisory commission for Asian American Pacific Islander stepped down. Last year, another 10 resigned. They complained in a scathing letter that Trump \u2019 s harsh executive orders, passage of federal funds to American cities, bans on refugees and improvements to the Affordable Care Act, had \u201d deleterious political \u201d for and Pacific Islanders. \u201d We responded to your portrayal of immigrants, migrants, people of color and people of various faiths as untrustworthy, threatening and a drain on our nation, \u201d the letter said. Only four commissioners remained on the panel.",
        "As Republicans look at ways to replace or repair the Affordable Care Act, many suggest that shrinking the list of services that insurers are required to offer in individual and small group plans would reduce costs and increase flexibility. That option came to the forefront last week when Seema Verma, who is slated to run the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services in the Trump administration, noted at her confirmation hearing that coverage for maternity services should be optional in those health plans. Maternity coverage is a popular target and one often mentioned by health law critics.",
        "During a sentencing hearing in Texas two decades ago, a defense attorney for a man named Duane Buck called on an expert who said his client\u2019s race made it more statistically likely that he would commit violent crimes in the future. Because of that statement, the Supreme Court has ruled that Buck, who is black, can appeal his death sentence.",
        "A federal judge in Texas has temporarily blocked an attempt by state health officials to remove Medicaid funds from Planned Parenthood, allowing the women\u2019s health provider to remain in the federal program at least until a lawsuit is settled. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said he will appeal the decision, which he said \u201dis disappointing and flies in the face of basic human decency,\u201d the Dallas Morning News reported. In trying to justify its action, state officials have pointed to undercover videos recorded by activists in Houston.",
        "Republican members of Congress aren\u2019t exactly getting a warm welcome in their home districts during this week\u2019s recess. Angry constituents have confronted legislators at town halls across the country, upset over everything from the GOP\u2019s plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, the Trump White House\u2019s travel ban, alleged Russian interference in the U. S. elections and more. New York Rep. Tom Reed, for example, faced these questions in a series of town halls he held over the weekend. The backlash is happening in some deep red places, stretching from Reed\u2019s western New York district to Kentucky and Iowa.",
        "Over the next few days, thousands of conservatives will converge on a conference center just outside of Washington, D. C. for the Conservative Political Action Conference. It\u2019s a gathering that, for the last several years at least, had a gravitational pull for any leader on the right who may have hoped to replace Barack Obama in the White House or play a role in opposing his presidency. Now that room is likely to be filled with elation since Republicans have total control in Washington.",
        "There are very few scenarios where I could see myself considering the flesh of a fellow human being as food, and the ultimatum \u201deat today or die tomorrow\u201d comes up in all of them. Most people are probably with me on this. But Bill Schutt\u2019s newest book, Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History, reveals that from a scientific perspective, there\u2019s a predictable calculus for when humans and animals go cannibal. And far more humans \u2014 and animals \u2014 have dipped into the world of cannibalism than you might have imagined.",
        "This year, the Paris museum that looks like a jumble of giant, colored pipes with an escalator in a clear plastic tube zigzagging up its side turns 40. Nowadays, that museum \u2014 the Pompidou Center \u2014 has a secure place in the heart of Paris and in Parisians\u2019 hearts. But it wasn\u2019t always the case. \u201dWhen it was first built, the reaction was one of horror,\u201d said Serge Lasvignes, president of the Pompidou Center, who recounted the museum\u2019s beginnings at a recent meeting with the Press Association of Paris, of which NPR is a member.",
        "Dozens of organizations have formed in the past decade to promote free or heart screenings for teens. The groups often claim such tests save lives by finding abnormalities that might pose a risk of sudden cardiac death. But the efforts are raising concerns. There\u2019s no evidence that screening adolescents with electrocardiograms prevents deaths. Sudden cardiac death is rare in young people, and some physicians worry screening kids with no symptoms or family history of disease could do more harm than good.",
        "Fake news has been, well, in the news a lot lately. But for the world\u2019s largest crowdsourced encyclopedia, it\u2019s nothing new. \u201dWikipedia has been dealing with fake news since it started 16 years ago,\u201d notes LiAnna Davis, deputy director of the Wiki Education Foundation. To combat misinformation, Wikipedia has developed a robust corps of volunteer editors. Anyone can write new entries and scrutinize existing ones for adherence to Wikipedia\u2019s rules on sourcing and neutrality.",
        "Every day on his way to class, Terrence Johnson walks by a bronze statue and thinks about history. The statue depicts James Meredith, who in 1962 became the first to enroll at the University of Mississippi. \u201dHe transcended so much,\u201d says Johnson, a junior. \u201dThe fact that he had the will to integrate a university like this in Mississippi that has such a rich and chaotic history . .. that will always be with me.\u201d Johnson\u2019s a journalism major, with a minor in studies.",
        "On Wednesday, the Trump administration made big news regarding the rights of transgender students. But what exactly changed? And what does it mean for students in school districts around the country? Here\u2019s our cheat sheet. 1. What just happened? Last May, the Obama administration sent what\u2019s called a \u201dDear Colleague\u201d letter to school districts. The letter, from the Justice and Education departments, made clear that the administration was interpreting Title IX, the law that prohibits sex discrimination in education, to include transgender students.",
        "Some students, principals, parents and attorneys have condemned the Trump administration\u2019s decision to remove some federal protections for transgender students. Those protections had been issued by President Barack Obama, who cited the federal Title IX law, and instructed public schools last year to allow transgender students to use restrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identities. But the departments of Education and Justice on Wednesday reversed that guidance, allowing state and local officials to pass rules that discriminate on the basis of gender identity without risk of losing federal funds, as we reported.",
        "The Trump administration is rescinding protections for transgender students in public schools. The move by the Justice and Education departments reverses guidance the Obama administration publicized in May 2016, which said a federal law known as Title IX protects the right of transgender students to use restrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identities. But on Wednesday, the two federal departments said the Obama documents do not \u201dcontain extensive legal analysis or explain how the position is consistent with the express language of Title IX, nor did they undergo any formal public process.",
        "President Trump\u2019s education secretary, Betsy DeVos, struck a defiant tone in brief remarks before conservative activists at a political conference outside Washington, D. C. on Thursday. But she held back on the administration\u2019s rescinding of Obama administration guidance to schools on transgender rights. \u201dThis issue was a very huge example of Obama administration overreach, approach to issues best solved at personal and local level,\u201d DeVos told the audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference, known as CPAC.",
        "Amid deep strains in the U. S. relationship with Mexico, a country that\u2019s been a favorite target of President Trump, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Homeland Security chief John Kelly took part in talks in Mexico City on Thursday that were aimed at smoothing out tensions. \u201dThat\u2019s going to be a tough trip,\u201d the president said Thursday morning at the White House. Some of the key issues between the two countries: immigration, border security, trade and U. S. aid to Mexico. In a Feb. 21 executive order, President Trump expanded the category of unauthorized immigrants the U. S.",
        "At a joint news conference in Mexico City on Thursday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson acknowledged the tension between the U. S. and Mexico. After talks with his Mexican counterpart, Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, Tillerson said that \u201din a relationship filled with vibrant colors, two strong sovereign countries, from time to time, will have differences.\u201d Standing beside him, Videgaray put a finer point on the matter: \u201dThere\u2019s a concern among Mexicans there\u2019s irritation [about] what has been perceived as [U.",
        "Top White House advisers Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus took the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference to make the case that despite seeming like a political odd couple, the two represent the successful marriage of disparate wings of the Republican Party, united under President Trump. \u201dThe truth of the matter is [Trump] brought together the party and the conservative movement, and I\u2019ve got to tell you, if the party and the conservative movement are together . .. it can\u2019t be stopped,\u201d said Priebus, the White House chief of staff and former chairman of the Republican National Committee.",
        "Richard Spencer, a white nationalist, was kicked out of the hotel where the Conservative Political Action Conference is taking place, a CPAC spokesman confirmed to NPR. Spencer was spotted in the lobby of the Gaylord National Resort outside Washington, D. C. talking with reporters. That\u2019s when CPAC officials were alerted to Spencer\u2019s presence. \u201dHis views are repugnant and have absolutely nothing to do with conservatism or what we do here,\u201d said CPAC spokesman Ian Walters. Spencer purchased a general admission pass Thursday morning, Walters said. \u201dHe\u2019s markets, \u201d Walters added.",
        "Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords has a message for members of Congress who are citing the possibility of protests as a reason not to hold town meetings: \u201dHave some courage.\u201d Giffords, wounded in a 2011 shooting outside a Tucson supermarket where she was meeting with constituents, was responding to a statement by Republican Congressman Louis Gohmert of Texas."
