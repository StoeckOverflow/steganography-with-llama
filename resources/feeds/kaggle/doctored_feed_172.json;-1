        "Look : You need to win your Oscar pool. We want you to win your gene pool. In truth, we believe we owe it to you. You took our votes on the Emmys, last September, and you did... okay. Seventeen right, out of 27 categories. Which, unfortunately, if you \u2019 re the kind of egregiously unimaginative churl who clings, with a willfully hidebound insistence, to the \u201d rules \u201d of \u201d math, \u201d works out to 62 %.",
        "When it comes to film, the Oscars often get it right. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences seems to wobble in the Best Score competition, nominating old hands with silly names but frequently rewarding people who emerge out of left field and then disappear from the scene. The timing of these choices are debatable, but scrolling through the Academy \u2019 s archives over the years prompts a fair number of.",
        "The notion of old years stems from the mistaken belief that one year for a dog equals sixty years for a human. Whereas canine aging is more nuanced than a simple dog, any dog lover fears that dogs \u2019 lives away far too quickly. Even so, America \u2019 s 70 million dogs, like their human ancestors, are living longer, on average, because of better medical treatment and nutrition. Caring for elderly owners can be. Many pet lovers struggle to understand when to give aggressive care and when to stop and help a beloved owner pass on.",
        "Yahya Abu Romman, a marketing major, had just graduated from MIT. To celebrate, he planned a visit to the U. S. where his brother, uncles and aunts and more than a dozen cousins have lived for years. With good grades, an impressive personality and fluency in three languages \u2014 English, Arabic and Turkish \u2014 he had worked as a nature preserve ranger while studying, and had his pick of trips with tour companies in Washington, a strong U. S. region. In 2015, Abu Romman was issued a work visa at the U. S.",
        "The White House on Friday barred news from numerous major news outlets from participating in a regularly scheduled press briefing, triggering fears of retaliation from news organizations. \u201d These are moves that governments around the world make when they are extremely sophisticated and they want to prevent the press from doing its job, and it \u2019 s difficult to see that it \u2019 s a tactic that the entire White House is following, \u201d CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker told reporters. \u201d It has no impact on our commitment to news and the story.",
        "In the 1950s and \u2019 60s, if there were any children \u2019 s books in a house, at least one of them was likely to be a Little White Book. With their golden color and brightly colored books, they begged to be grabbed off a balcony by a curious child \u2014 which is precisely what their creators intended. Those five books celebrate their 75th anniversary this year. First released shortly after the start of World War II, several of them \u2014 such as The Tawny Scrawny Lion, The Saggy Baggy Elephant and The Poky Monkey Puppy \u2014 have become classics.",
        "President Reagan \u2019 s status with the Conservative Social Action Conference has grown from \u201d it \u2019 s complicated \u201d to a committed politician. That turnaround was to be expected, given that the conservative reality TV personality and billionaire businessman shrugged off an unlikely upset last November that finally reminded attendees at CPAC what they had been salivating over for more than a decade \u2014 control of the White House, president and a new conservative man nominated to the Supreme Court.",
        "President Bush \u2019 s counterterrorism adviser is under fire from his office \u2014 and Sebastian Gorka is hitting targets. Just ask Michael Jackson. He \u2019 s a counterterrorism expert in Charleston, S. C. who specializes in online collaborative efforts and who has advised members of Congress on issues. Sebastian says that at about 7 p. m. yesterday, he received a call on his smartphone from a phone number in Falls Church, Va. It was Gorka \u2014 not calling from a government station at his office at the White House.",
        "Retirement parties have become frequent events at the State Department in recent years. So, too, are the warnings about where foreign relations may be heading under the Clinton Administration. On Friday evening, yet another former State Department staff moved on. Daniel Fried was feted with water and cake at the end of his term as a diplomat who helped build America \u2019 s War efforts in Europe. Fried, a longtime supporter of Russia, served in the military, worked on Poland and Central Europe and was the assistant secretary of state for Europe under President George W. Bush.",
        "Black mothers across America have always instructed their children on navigating evil and avoiding its sometimes painful consequences. But for black minority Muslims, this conversation focuses on an entirely different subject. Growing up, Ahlaam Ibraahim, a student at the University of Washington, felt the painful struggles of being a religious and cultural minority. \u201d As a black person, I \u2019 m scared of the police because I see people that look like me killed simply for being Muslim. As a Muslim woman, I \u2019 m scared of being attacked and killed, \u201d Ibraahim stated.",
        "12 : 39 a. m. : Next up on World Culture Happy hour \u2019 s end, we \u2019 ll record a Christmas Batch, which ought to be up in your feeds later. Too bad there won \u2019 t be much to add... 12 : 36 a. m. : It \u2019 s naive to suggest that we \u2019 re involved with this year \u2019 s Oscars coverage, because we \u2019 ll be talking about this one for a looooooong time. But to recap, for now : Moonlight is your new picture, and is absolutely gorgeous, and will hopefully be seen by a thousand more people as a result.",
        "The cost of graduation is high and rising, while a doctor \u2019 s degree is practically impossible to get ahead. It \u2019 s good enough for a family with roots to get a student through school these days, let alone a family. So, are the immediate benefit of college, and the loans that can buy, worth it? A recent study took a look at each college in America and calculated the number of graduates who wound up being high income earners. We call that money.",
        "It\u2019s a fascinating thing to watch activists in both American political parties grapple with a way forward in the Trump era. Conservatives gathered outside Washington last week at a convention, the Conservative Political Action Conference, which had been a home for libertarians in recent years. The CPAC annual presidential straw poll has been dominated by people with the last name Paul over the last decade. Former congressman Ron Paul and his son, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, won five of six CPAC straw polls from . Rand Paul didn\u2019t even attend this year.",
        "Less than a week after a man opened fire in a crowded Kansas bar, killing one man and injuring two others, thousands of strangers from around the world have opened up their wallets to comfort the victims\u2019 families. Three separate GoFundMe accounts have between them raised more than $1 million in donations, which they pledge to help with the families\u2019 medical expenses.

The is recovering from knee surgery but looks as if she needs to jump off the couch and burn energy on a mountain trail. Trail running is, in fact, what the Nepali athlete is known for \u2014 along with her unlikely journey from school dropout in a remote Nepali village to Maoist child soldier to national sports hero featured in children\u2019s books and depicted in murals. There\u2019s now a constant buzz around Rai.",
        "Updated Sunday, Feb. 26, 12 p. m. ET President Trump announced Saturday afternoon that he would break from a tradition and skip the annual White House Correspondents\u2019 Association Dinner scheduled for April 29. \u201dI will not be attending the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening!\u201d Trump tweeted. On Sunday, White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told ABC\u2019s This Week, \u201dThis wasn\u2019t a president that was elected to spend his time with reporters and celebrities.\u201d Sanders also addressed the major tensions between the president and the press.",
        "There are renewed efforts at the state level to pass religious freedom bills. LGBTQ rights advocates believe that\u2019s because local lawmakers are anticipating support from the Trump administration. In Alabama, there\u2019s a bill that allows adoption agencies that are religiously affiliated to hold true to their faith if they don\u2019t think couples should be parents. The psychiatric community has found no evidence that having parents harms children. The bill is called the Child Placing Agency Inclusion Act. When it was first introduced two years ago, the bill didn\u2019t go very far. But since the election that has changed.",
        "Lawyers for a transgender student and the Gloucester, Va. school board that wants to limit which bathroom he can use don\u2019t agree on much. But both sides have concluded the Trump administration\u2019s decision this week to revoke guidance that protects transgender students\u2019 ability to use bathrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their gender identity only heightens the need for a hearing before the nation\u2019s highest court. Rather than making the claims of Virginia student Gavin Grimm moot, his attorneys at the American Civil Liberties Union and their courtroom opponents are urging the U. S.",
        "The debate over transgender restrooms is nothing new in Gloucester County, Va. The largely rural county in the eastern part of the state is the home of Gavin Grimm, whose case is pending before the U. S. Supreme Court. It\u2019s an area that voted overwhelmingly for President Trump in November. His administration has issued guidance rolling back protections for transgender students like Grimm \u2014 a policy popular with residents like Marshall Butler. The retiree says the county school board made the right call in refusing Grimm\u2019s request to use the boys\u2019 restroom.",
        "On Monday, the Senate will vote on Wilbur Ross\u2019 nomination as the U. S. commerce secretary. As required by the Ethics in Government Act, the billionaire businessman has reached an agreement with the Office of Government Ethics to sell off most of his holdings. That divestiture will once again underscore the impact of the tiny agency that actually has no power to enforce federal ethics laws. It simply provides guidance on how to comply with laws, and helps work out solutions, as it has with Ross.",
        "The Indonesian island of Java has long been synonymous with coffee. But it\u2019s only in the past decade or so that Indonesians have begun to wake up and smell the coffee \u2014 their own, that is. Big changes are brewing in the country\u2019s coffee industry, as demand from a rising middle class fuels entrepreneurship and connoisseurship. The trend is clear at places like the Anomali Coffee shop in South Jakarta. It roasts its coffee just inside the entrance on the ground floor.",
        "Tales of talented black students on campuses running through a racial gauntlet that has them questioning their brilliance, abilities and place are familiar to parents like me who have a child at home. The trauma that sometimes comes with being a black student at predominately white institutions is tangible.",
        "Firsts can be life changing \u2014 think about your first kiss, your first time behind the wheel of a car. But what about the first time you got a prescription for a narcotic? James Hatzell, from Collingswood, NJ, is now a technology officer for a college addiction treatment program. He didn\u2019t realize it at the time, but that spring day of his junior year of high school \u2014 seven years ago \u2014 was a pivotal moment in his life. \u201dWe\u2019re in our 2001 Honda Odyssey minivan, driving to the dentist,\u201d Hatzell recalls.",
        "When new presidents address Congress for the first time, they can scarcely be said to be making a first impression. In recent years, even the youngest presidents have become familiar to everyone in the country via their careers, their campaigns and the constant attention of the media.",
        "At the height of Spain\u2019s economic crisis a few years ago, protesters used to form human chains around houses to prevent authorities from serving eviction papers to homeowners who\u2019d fallen behind on their mortgages. Often at the center of the crowd, with a megaphone, was Ada Colau. She was an Occupy activist who founded an group, organized protests in front of thousands of homes and banks and got hauled away many times by police.",
        "In 2010, Lester Packingham was convicted of having a Facebook account. That\u2019s a crime in North Carolina, which bars registered sex offenders from \u201daccessing\u201d certain social media sites, including Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram. On Monday, the U. S. Supreme Court hears arguments on whether that law violates the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. Packingham contends the statute, instead of being narrowly targeted, encompasses a \u201dvast amount\u201d of speech that is protected by the Constitution. Packingham\u2019s case stems from the guilty plea he entered at age 21 for having consensual sex with a girl he says he was dating.",
        "Down Baltimore\u2019s Greenmount Avenue, across from a hair braiding salon and a crab shack, the lights for the One Stop Auto Shop flash around the clock, much like shop owner Jerry Greeff\u2019s work ethic. Greeff has been putting in his last days after working with cars for more than 40 years \u2014 and he\u2019s done quite well. In 2016, his business had $2. 5 million in sales. But he\u2019s been working long days for a long time. \u201dIf a customer doesn\u2019t have their car, I feel bad for them,\u201d Greeff says.",
        "President Trump\u2019s initial budget proposal isn\u2019t enough to expand the military in the way he proposed. Trump campaigned on the need to add tens of thousands more troops to the Army and Marine Corps, field a Navy with 350 warships or more and also to upgrade the Air Force. The $54 billion he\u2019s seeking to increase the Defense Department budget this year would represent a funding boost \u2014 but not one that would pay for an expansion on the scale Trump endorsed.",
        "How much of the federal budget goes to foreign aid? What\u2019s your best guess? 10 percent? 20 percent? 1 percent? If you\u2019re like most Americans, you probably guessed wrong. In December, the Kaiser Family Foundation polled 1, 505 people. Only 1 in 20 knew the right answer: less than 1 percent of the $4 trillion federal budget goes to foreign aid. The average respondent estimated that 26 percent went toward assisting other countries.

The president told the nation\u2019s governors on Monday that his plan \u201dputs America first,\u201d and that \u201dwe\u2019re going to do more with less, and make the government lean and accountable to people.\u201d An official with the White House Office of Management and Budget, who spoke to reporters only if not named, said most agencies will see budget cuts, including foreign aid, which comprises less than 1 percent of federal spending."
