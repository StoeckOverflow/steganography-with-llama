        "When it comes to climate change, we often speak of the cars we drive and the machinery we use in our homes and business. They are, after all, some of the biggest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. But what about the breakfast you ate for breakfast this morning? A new study entitled Monday in Nature Review breaks down the environmental consequences of producing a loaf of bread, from vegetable field to bakery. It suggests that the bulk of the associated greenhouse gas emissions come from just one of the many factors that go into making that loaf : eating.",

        "Wildfires can start when fire strikes or when someone fails to put out a campfire. New evidence shows that people control a lot more fires than people does \u2014 so much so that people are considering altering wildfire in America. Green ecologist Melissa Forder says about 60 percent of fires in national forests are caused by humans : \u201d humans set fires, fires burning and spreading into the forests, smoking, equipment malfunctions and campfires. \u201d But the need for all forests is even bigger.

        "Tuesday night, President Trump will attend a joint session of Congress for the first time. After a successful first month, it will be a means for Trump to reset his relationship with Republicans, who currently give him low ratings. It will also be a day for him to reassure congressional staff, whose view of the current administration runs the gamut from optimism to unease. Here are two things to watch for when Trump goes to Capitol Hill on Tuesday. 1.",

C.\u2019s National Symphony Orchestra to play the musical interludes between stories on All Things Considered. Steven Reineke, the NSO\u2019s principal pops conductor, says the experience was both gratifying and surprising. \u201dThe whole experience has just been so much fun, from the first time I heard about this, but it really didn\u2019t take full shape until today,\u201d Reineke says.",

But they made headlines this weekend when a transgender boy \u2014 barred by state rules from competing in the boys\u2019 league \u2014 won his weight class, against girls. Mack Beggs, the teenage boy in question, hasn\u2019t sought the spotlight. By all accounts he just wants to wrestle. But media attention found him anyway. In part, that\u2019s because some parents of female wrestlers have vocally objected to the fact that Beggs, who has been taking testosterone as part of his gender transition, is wrestling girls.",
        "So. How\u2019d you do? Did you follow my advice in making your Oscar pool picks? . .. You did? All of them? Hunh. Well then. That means you got 13 out of the evening\u2019s 24 categories correct. That\u2019s . .. 54%. So. Yes. Well. Cough. You probably didn\u2019t win, then. But what is \u201dwinning,\u201d anyway? This is art, we\u2019re talking about! The sundry achievements of those engaged in the magic of cinema, with its dreams made of flickering light and shadow, are not some base, competitive sport, surely! Why, the very idea! Whither aesthetics?",
        "Well, excuse me while I throw away my first draft, won\u2019t you? For quite a while, Sunday night\u2019s Oscars seemed fairly tame. La La Land, the retro musical with Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, came into the Oscars as a favorite, having tied the nomination record with a total of 14.

So far, he\u2019s photographed 6, 500 different species, which leaves approximately 6, 000 to go. Sartore tells Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross that presenting the animals in the studio, rather than in nature, gives them equal importance in the eye of the viewer. \u201dA mouse is every bit as glorious as an elephant, and a tiger beetle is every bit as big and important as a tiger,\u201d he says.",
        "One of the very first bills President Trump signed into law this month killed a Securities and Exchange Commission rule meant to promote transparency in countries riddled with corruption. Trump said getting rid of the rule, which required oil, gas and mining companies to disclose overseas royalties and other payments, would bring back jobs and save extraction companies many hours of paperwork and, potentially, hundreds of millions of dollars. But critics of this rollback say it could make the U. S. less safe.",
        "A Minnesota police officer accused of fatally shooting Philando Castile in a St. Paul suburb last July pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and two other charges. St. Anthony police Officer Jeronimo Yanez entered his plea in a brief hearing in Ramsey County district court. Earlier this month, Judge William H.

        "Whether your kid is 3 and obsessed with Daniel Tiger videos or 15 and spending half her conscious hours on Snapchat, you are probably somewhat conflicted about how to think about their media habits. How much time? What kind of media? What should our family\u2019s rules be? When the American Academy of Pediatrics released its latest recommendations on these burning questions Friday, it also did something pretty cool: it launched an online tool that parents can use to create their own family media plan.",
        "took off its cool over the weekend \u2014 and lit itself ablaze in the process. Two seemingly unrelated threads this past weekend served as raucous, reminders that is not just a genre measured by charts, award show accolades and platinum plaques, but an organic culture unbound by industry rules. In one corner, a battle staged between legendary beatsmiths turned into a lovefest. In the other, a shot of ether, fired from one New York queen towards another, was instantly canonized alongside the most vicious disses on record.",
        "Millions of people in Chile are scrambling to find alternative sources of drinking water after authorities cut off service to the capital, Santiago, following torrential rains that contaminated the water supply.

        "In my head, a person with the name Danny has a boyish face and a perpetual smile. Zoes have wide eyes and wild hair and an air of mild bemusement. There might actually be something to the idea that people who share a name also share a stereotypical \u201dlook\u201d to them, researchers say. In one experiment, published Monday in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, scientists found that when people are shown a stranger\u2019s face and a choice of five names, they pick the right name about 35 percent of the time.",
        "Sweeney Todd is a piece of theater that should make you lose your appetite. The grisly musical by Stephen Sondheim tells the story of a demonic barber whose clients become the filling for meat pies. Many productions leave the stage soaked in blood. And yet, at the Barrow Street Theatre in New York City earlier this month, Mary Alice Kellog eagerly dug into a hot meat pie. It\u2019s part of the experience. Kellog said she\u2019s seen every New York production of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street since the show originated in 1979.",

President Trump signed documents Tuesday directing the Environmental Protection Agency and the U. S.

        "When 2011 began, the worst recession in two generations was technically over, but Annica Trotter, Ray Meyer, and Jennifer and Brian Barfield were unemployed and searching for work. Six years later, their experience demonstrates life doesn\u2019t just snap back to normal after a job loss. Their economic recovery remains incomplete and in some ways their story is America\u2019s story. NPR first profiled Trotter, Meyer, the Barfields and two others in the St. Louis area in 2011 as part of a project called The Road Back to Work. For a year, they kept audio diaries documenting their quest for employment."
