        "President Obama likes to tout the booming stock market as evidence that he is already boosting the market. He bragged about it in his speech to Congress on Thursday night, and then got more to the point on Wednesday, when the Dow Jones industrial average climbed above 21, 000 for the first time. To many, this is validation of the policies he has pushed thus far.
