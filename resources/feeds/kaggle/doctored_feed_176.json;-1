        "Russia \u2019 s Ambassador to the United States, Yuri Kislyak, is not known to seek the limelight. He \u2019 s a spy and an arms control specialist who came to Washington as well in 2008. But he has been in the news a lot of years, as Trump administration ties with him come under scrutiny. David Flynn, President Obama \u2019 s original national security adviser, had to resign after advising the administration about his phone conversation with Kislyak. And now, Trump \u2019 s attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has come under fire for meeting illegally with the ambassador last summer.",
        "U. S. Rep. Frank Pallone, a Democrat from New Jersey, has been trying to get a look at the Republicans \u2019 seeking to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. He \u2019 s the Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which will have to consider the bill before the whole House can vote on it. But as of Thursday morning, Pallone still couldn \u2019 t get his eyes on a copy. \u201d We have no idea right now what they \u2019 re considering, \u201d he said of his House colleagues. Rep.",
        "President Obama \u2019 s declaration during his speech to Democrats Tuesday night that Obamacare is \u201d still \u201d and must be replaced was cheered by voters. But Republican lawmakers remain trying to coalesce behind an approach to their policies of repeal and replace, and many believe they hold the upper hand to the fate of the Affordable Care Act. In an interview with Weekend Edition host Chuck Inskeep that aired Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the odds \u201d are much greater than half \u201d that the ACA will stay in place.",
        "Nora McInerny is full of small talk. \u201d I don \u2019 t get small talk... \u201d she said on her podcast. \u201d I want the big talk. \u201d McInerny \u2019 s show is Nothing Terrible, Thanks for Asking, and she begins each show with the same question : How are you? The responses she sends go way beyond the typical \u201d I \u2019 m fine. \u201d McInerny deals with death, loss and relationships through trauma. But her approach to these sensitive subjects is saturated with depth and humor. She shares ( or, as she sees it \u2014 overshares ) some of her stories with NPR \u2019 s Mark Shapiro.",
        "When greeting web designer Emily McDowell had done, she got a lot of something that just felt weird. \u201d A letter is kind of strange if you look not, \u201d she tells NPR \u2019 s Dan Martin. So McDowell started receiving nontraditional sympathy cards. They meant things like \u201d Please let me be the first one to punch the next girl who tells you everything happens for a reason. I \u2019 m sorry you \u2019 re going through this. \u201d Now, McDowell \u2019 s new book takes that idea one step further.",
        "I believe in always going to the funeral. My mother taught me that. The first time he said it directly to me, I was 16 and struggling to get out of going to work hours for Miss Jones, my old fifth grade math teacher. I did not want to go. My father was unequivocal. \u201d boy, \u201d he said, \u201d you \u2019 re going. Please go to the funeral. Do it for the people. \u201d So my dad waited inside while I went in. It was worse than I thought it would be : I was the only kid there.",
        "Updated at 10 : 15 p. m. ET, Three of Caterpillar \u2019 s factories in Illinois \u2014 including its employees \u2014 were searched by federal prosecutors on Thursday. The warrant prompted a search for evidence of intelligence reports related to the subsidiary \u2019 s exports. Peoria Public Broadcasting reported, \u201d In 2014, the U. S. government issued a report that could be related to today \u2019 s... business.

        "Long William Logan, James Mangold \u2019 s favorite, stirring requiem for the franchise \u2019 s most iconic character. The only problem with calling it the boldest and most affecting superhero movie in many years is that it \u2019 s barely a superhero movie at all. It doesn \u2019 t talk like a superhero : too many including its very first movie. And it doesn \u2019 t walk like a hero : No cities are razed in its finale, no mere thousands sacrificed. Even with its gnarly medley of stabbings, slicings, skewerings, and impalings in what has been, Deadpool excepted, a franchise, Logan sure feels bloodier than most of its ilk.",
        "The Department of Homeland Security is stepping up its support for Jewish institutions across the nation who \u2019 ve received more than 120 terrorist threats in the past three months. Jewish Research Centers have been pressing for closure as they \u2019 ve been targeted by waves of telephone calls as well as vandalism. Since January, the calls coming in to JCCs have been both vivid and unnerving. Betzy Lynch, former director of the JCC in Birmingham, Ala. addressed three of the threatening emails, all very similar.",
        "In 2009, Maj. Jane Jennings Hegar was shot down by the enemy in Afghanistan while an Air National Guard medevac helicopter. Although she was wounded in her rifle shooting, Hegar managed to return safely while hanging onto a nearby helicopter, which saved the lives of her crew and her patients. At the time, the Department of Defense encouraged female soldiers to serve in air combat, but forbade females from ground combat training.",
        "At a conference in Houston on Thursday, more than a dozen public and private funders pledged a final total of $ 190 million for two family planning organizations that stand to lose their U. S. support as a result of Donald Trump \u2019 s Jan. 23 campaign action to block U. S. foreign aid financing of groups linked to abortion. The policy disqualifies organizations that ban abortions or advocate for the procedure \u2019 s legalization, as well as those that provide patients with specific information about abortion or physician referrals to obtain the procedure.",
        "Newly minted Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke knows how to get an entrance : He arrived at his final day of work in Atlanta on the back of a horse called Tonto. Zinke rode the horse \u2014 a red roan gelding just over 17 hands tall \u2014 less than a mile, from the National Park Service \u2019 s stables on the National Mall to the Department of the Interior. The former congressman \u2019 s equine entrance alluded to both his own aristocratic upbringing, and to Theodore Roosevelt, who expanded the National Park Service significantly during his presidency.",

Six Democrats and one Independent joined with the Republicans to approve the nomination \u2014 mostly Democrats who are up for next year and represent states that voted for President Trump, NPR\u2019s Arnie Seipel reports. \u201dSen.

        "For years, parents have been warning their children to be careful what they post on social media. Now, one young candidate is learning this important lesson the hard way \u2014 everything you post can and will be used against you in politics. Jon Ossoff, 30, is running as a Democrat in a special election in Georgia. But the Congressional Leadership Fund, a superPAC aligned with GOP leadership, launched an attack ad Wednesday hitting him with some unflattering college footage. It includes a clip of him dressed as Han Solo in a Star Wars parody of the school\u2019s alcohol policy.",
        "For a man who had just spent a week living inside a rock, sucking oxygen through tiny air holes and storing days\u2019 worth of his own waste in bottles closely around himself, Abraham Poincheval was admirably . \u201dI\u2019m a little dazed, which I imagine is totally normal after one week living in a rock,\u201d the French performance artist told reporters who had gathered Wednesday at Paris\u2019 Palais de Tokyo museum to see him emerge from the more than boulder.",
        "Amid escalating anxieties over recent Russian activities, Sweden has approved a plan to reinstitute military conscription beginning next year. The draft, which will pull from both young men and women, will be Sweden\u2019s first since 2010, when the country discontinued compulsory service. The country expects to call up at least 4, 000 young people per year for military training, in a bid to erase its deficits in recruitment since the draft ended. The government says it has been recruiting about 2, 500 people for military service annually, about 1, 500 fewer than it says it needs.",

        "On Puerto Rico\u2019s southwestern corner, the sleepy seaside town of Guanica is where, nearly 120 years ago, the U. S. relationship with the island began during the War. The town\u2019s museum director, Francisco Rodriguez, takes visitors to the town\u2019s waterfront where the invasion began. In Spanish he says, \u201dThis is Guanica Bay, where the American troops commanded by General Nelson Miles landed on July 25, 1898.\u201d At the site, a stone marker engraved by the 3rd Battalion of the U. S. Army commemorates the invasion.",
        "March 2, 2017 marks the centennial of the Act, legislation passed by the U. S. Congress that granted citizenship to the people living in Puerto Rico. (The territory had become U. S. property in 1898, at the end of the War.) The result has been a century of Puerto Rican culture becoming part of the U. S. fabric, and nowhere is that more evident than in music. This week, percussionist and educator Bobby Sanabria joins us as we hop in the Way Back Machine and explore some of the highlights of 100 years of musical .",

        "Ali Brivanlou slides open a glass door at the Rockefeller University in New York to show off his latest experiments probing the mysteries of the human embryo. \u201dAs you can see, all my lab is glass \u2014 just to make sure there is nothing that happens in some dark rooms that gives people some weird ideas,\u201d says Brivanlou, perhaps only half joking. Brivanlou knows that some of his research makes some people uncomfortable. That\u2019s one reason he has agreed to give me a look at what\u2019s going on.",
        "People who have survived melanoma were more likely to protect themselves from sun exposure than those who hadn\u2019t experienced the disease, but a significant portion of them still reported getting a sunburn in the past year, among other behaviors that might increase the risk of a new cancer. The study, which appears Thursday in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention, included 724 cancer survivors who had been diagnosed with melanoma, a potentially deadly form of skin cancer, between July 2004 and December 2007.",
        "In Latin America, Lent is full of elaborate Catholic rituals, from palm weavings and sawdust carpets to processions of robed penitents. But only in Ecuador will you find fanesca, the equally elaborate Lenten soup. \u201dFanesca is a traditional Ecuadorian dish of unmatched flavor,\u201d says Lily Rodriguez, a home cook in the capital city of Quito. \u201dIt\u2019s a stew that combines 12 tender grains and dried cod in a creamy base.

        "An aircraft flying at night drops a flock of unpowered drones. They carry food, medicines and batteries. After delivering their load on the ground, the drones vaporize into thin air within hours. Disposable drones that can make precise deliveries before vanishing may look like a product of Stark Industries. But the fictional giant of military technology run by Tony \u201dIron Man\u201d Stark has nothing to do with them. Instead, the development of \u201ddisappearing delivery vehicles\u201d is a project by DARPA, the Department of Defense\u2019s research and development agency.",
        "If a snake bites you in a remote Amazonian village like Pampa Hermosa, Peru, and the local doctor is out of the right it might be wise to prepare some goodbyes. The nearest resupply, in a town called Contamana, is up to six hours away by riverboat, and you might not last that long. But you might last 35 minutes, the travel time between Pampa Hermosa and Contamana as the drone flies.",
        "My bank sends me a text alert when my account balance is low. My wireless company sends me a text alert when I\u2019m about to use up my monthly data. Somebody \u2014 I guess the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration? \u2014 sends me a text alert when it\u2019s going to rain a whole lot. A few clever researchers said: \u201dHey! What if we could send text alerts to parents when students miss class or don\u2019t turn in their homework?\u201d And what do you know, it worked. Take it away, Peter Bergman and Eric W.",
        "In a new book, The Complacent Class, economist Tyler Cowen argues that the United States is standing still. People have grown more risk averse and are reluctant to switch jobs or move to another state, he says, and the desire to innovate \u2014 to grow and change \u2014 has gone away. In an interview with NPR\u2019s Rachel Martin, Cowen says he\u2019s worried that more and more communities are \u2014 by income, education or race."
