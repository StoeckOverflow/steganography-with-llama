Puerto Ricans on the island can \u2019 t vote for the U. S. president in the general elections and they lack representation in Congress. There is, however, one day where Puerto Ricans enjoy status as an \u201d independent entity \u201d \u2014 that \u2019 s at the Olympics, where Puerto Ricans compete under their own rules.

        "A comic play about menstruation... aimed at boys? That \u2019 s what Mom has created. It started when a UNICEF student there looked at what happens when a girl gets her period. In a squad of over 1, 100 girls, the team found lots of concerns about the racist remarks boys might make. They \u2019 d point at a girl \u2019 s stained skirt and whisper, \u201d Hey, it \u2019 s leaking. \u201d Or when a girl put her book back behind her back to erase any stains, they \u2019 d say things like, \u201d Why are you acting weird? \u201d Why is staining a girl?",
        "As horror films go, 1962 \u2019 s What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? was a B movie, in budget and, if I gave it enough, a letter grade. It didn \u2019 t earn an A for its scares or its innovation, as Alfred Hitchcock \u2019 s Psycho did two years ago, or his movie The Birds released in the following year. But there was something about Baby Jane, with its pairing of two actress lovers \u2014 one confined to a corner, the other obsessed by memories of her better days as a child star \u2014 that was truly, deeply haunted.",
        "When Ryan Murphy explains what he does as a TV showrunner, he realizes it can sound kind of lofty. \u201d The greatest thing that you have when you \u2019 re a showrunner is this opportunity to change worlds, \u201d he says, smiling a bit. \u201d And it always sounds so insane when somebody asks, \u2019 Well, what do you do? \u2019 And you say, \u2019 I created worlds. \u2019 \u201d Murphy ranks as the top creative assistant on the TV shows he usually produces.

EST, FBI Director William Comey has requested that the Justice Department publicly deny President Trump \u2019 s allegation that President Barack Obama had ordered a wiretap of President Trump, a law enforcement official confirms to CNN \u2019 s Carrie Johnson. The New York Times quickly broke that story. The Department of Justice has so far given no comment on this development.

        "Joshua Mark Tillman, a. k. a. emoji Father John Misty, performed several songs on Saturday Night Live this weekend that represent two of the bedrocks of Western television : entertainment and religion. \u201d albums Entertainment Forever \u201d and \u201d Pure Comedy, \u201d both from his upcoming EP Pure Comedy ( given out April 7 on Sub Pop ) are criticisms of societal opiates. Given the state of American musical discourse right now, Tillman \u2019 s presence on late night \u2019 s comedy stage \u2014 which typically featured musicians much more experienced than the Los songwriter \u2014 was a coded message from the SNL staff bookers.",
        "Democrats have a long way to go to lead their party after brutal victories across the board last November. But they \u2019 re seeing glimmers of hope in recent and upcoming presidential elections where they argue the backlash to Donald Trump is resulting in defeat at the ballot box.

Relatives of the Kansas shooting victims are urging other Indians to not send their kids to study in the U. S. The shooter, who is behind bars, killed one of the three people who were shot.

No, Lee was interested in the opposite: a gathering over a meal where all sorts of perspectives get aired.",
        "For more than a year, Donald Trump has harped on white nostalgia. A hearkening back to a rosy, but ambiguous, time in American history with his Make America Great Again slogan propelled his presidential run. It was a message, though, largely not embraced in minority communities, given that blacks, Latinos and women were fighting for equal rights during the same period Trump has indicated he believes America was great (the Industrial Revolution and the War II 1940s and \u201950s).",

        "Back in the olden days \u2014 maybe five years ago in Moscow time \u2014 the Russian word for barbershop was rather quaint: parikmakherskaya, or literally, \u201dwig shop.\u201d While women could tend to their coiffures in ubiquitous salony krasoty, beauty salons, men had to content themselves with surly babushkas delivering awkward, haircuts in spartan halls.

Once there, they would raid a factory and arrest 361 immigrants in the country illegally, along with the people who hired them. It\u2019s been 10 years since federal agents raided the textile plant.

        "Full Frontal host Samantha Bee makes no bones about the fact that she was caught off guard by Donald Trump\u2019s victory on election night. \u201dWe had a balloon drop planned. . .. We had balloons in our rafters, and we had to call it [off],\u201d Bee tells Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross. \u201dWe were able to do a reset, but it was not an easy process by any means.\u201d For Bee and Jo Miller, the show\u2019s Trump\u2019s win meant doubling down on their coverage of the White House, much to their chagrin.",
