        "Over the last 15 years, drummer and composer Jon Smith has built the quintessential jazz resume : He \u2019 s been in bands founded by jazz legends, such as violinist Dave Holland, and touring with some of the music \u2019 s rising talents, like saxophonist Harry Potter. Jazz players often lead nomadic lives they go where the musicians are. A growing contingent of saxophone players are musical nomads, too : They \u2019 re reworking the instruments they grew up with \u2014 rock, moving \u2014 into settings for jazz audiences. Smith, 42, is among them.",
        "For young people, social media would not be so social after all. Among teenagers in that age group, heavy use of platforms such as Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram was associated with feelings of emotional isolation, a study concluded. The results surprised biologist Brian Primack. \u201d It \u2019 s social networking, so aren \u2019 t people going to be better connected? \u201d he says. He \u2019 s head of the Center for Research on Culture, Technology and Health at the University of Pittsburgh. And while his team \u2019 s new research connecting social media use and interaction in young adults wasn \u2019 t overly surprising, these new findings seemed counterintuitive.",
        "In a reversal, the Supreme Court will not decide upon Grimm \u2019 s lawsuit over a proposed policy that requires men to use the bathroom prior to their biological sex. The Court was scheduled to hear the case this month. The Supreme Court sent the case back to the 4th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday. Its opinion cites the Trump Administration \u2019 s recent move to rescind state guidelines that transgender persons have the right to use bathrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their biological identity.",
        "After Germany held a political rally featuring a Turkish minister, Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan likened the German officials to the Nazis. The comments struck a \u201d new low in Germany, \u201d NPR \u2019 s Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reporting from Berlin. German authorities condemned the inflammatory comment but \u201d stopped short of punitive measures against Ankara over the matter, \u201d Soraya stated. \u201d That \u2019 s because Germany desperately needed Turkey \u2019 s help to keep asylum seekers from flooding into Germany. \u201d Germany is home to around 1. 5 million Turks hoping to vote in Turkey \u2019 s EU referendum, according to Turkish media.",
        "Tossing a coin into a pool is believed to be good advice. But it proved to be terrible timing for a green sea goddess who consumed nearly 1, 000 objects thrown into her pool. The great green sea woman is now recovering from an surgery on Tuesday. Veterinarians removed some 11 pounds of garbage that she couldn \u2019 t digest, according to The Associated Press. \u201d It is hard to imagine how it took such a large number of individuals. I \u2019 ve never seen such a creature before, \u201d as Pasakorn Brikshavana, of Chulalongkorn University \u2019 s veterinary surgery department told the Washington Post.",
        "Historically, when humans have sought a reliable supply of calories \u2014 particularly one that can be easily nabbed from an unsuspecting animal with minimal exertion and minimal horticulture skills \u2014 we have often appealed to eggs. We \u2019 ve pilfered the ova of countless animals since Neolithic times. But it is the nutritive and symbolic capacities of the single bird egg, including that of the chicken, that we have most consistently championed : reliable nourishment, a hangover cure, an emblem of rebirth \u2014 when necessary, a supreme projectile. As P. C.",
        "Bonuses paid to officials and administrators in the University of Missouri System \u201d may violate the Missouri Constitution, \u201d the state auditor says in a new audit that details hidden bonuses, \u201d including \u201d luxury vehicle allowances \u2014 and $ 100, 000 in interim payments to a chancellor who leaves amid a furor, only to be rehired in a new election months later.",

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which runs the satellite, sends the first image from a human instrument, a lightning bolt. It shows lightning storms over the course of an hour on Father \u2019 s Day, from the Gulf of Mexico down to the southern coast of South America.",
        "A band from the great Latin alternative community in Los Angeles is poised to break out in a big way. Their sound is lounge grooves, filled with flavors from Mexico or Brazil and a funky swagger. Their style is matching puffy tuxedo shirts and white ties, like they \u2019 re attending a prom in 1976. Even their name is unforgettable : Chicano Music.",
        "Young individuals are known for exploration and explanation they poke and they prod, they open and push, they ask : \u201d Why? Why? Why? \u201d Some people describe these strategies to explore and explain as a characteristic characteristic of our species others highlight their intimate role in learning. It \u2019 s of particular value, then, to understand the basis for understanding and and to investigate how they affect the way we interact with the world. A review by researchers M. D.",
        "Last night Felicia Keesing returned from a long visit and found that her home in upstate New York had been subjected to an invasion. \u201d There was evidence of mice everywhere. They had completely taken over, \u201d said Keesing, an ecologist at Bard College. It was a plague of mice. And it had landed right in Keesing \u2019 s brain. \u201d Not only were there mouse droppings on our countertops, but we also found dead mice on the kitchen floor, \u201d says Keesing \u2019 s partner, Rick Ostfeld, an ecologist at the Cary Center of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.

        "This spring and fall may be a doozy for Lyme disease, at least in parts of the Northeast. \u201d We \u2019 re anticipating 2017 to be a potentially risky year for Lyme, \u201d wrote Rick Ostfeld, a disease ecologist at the Carnegie Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, New York. Ostfeld has been studying the debilitating disease for more than 20 years, and has developed an early warning system working on mice.

        "Symphony orchestras and opera companies across the country continually ask the same question: How do we attract a younger and more diverse audience? Saturday night, I discovered something of an answer at the Washington National Opera\u2019s east coast premiere of Champion, a opera by jazz trumpeter and composer Terence Blanchard. In 21 seasons of attending WNO performances, I\u2019ve never witnessed a more diverse crowd. The opera\u2019s themes of sexual orientation and the American Dream seem to resound even more loudly today than when the opera premiered in St. Louis in 2013.",
        "It had been quite the week for Maren Morris: Four days before the strolled into NPR\u2019s offices, she\u2019d pulled off a mighty duet with Alicia Keys during the 59th annual Grammys ceremony and taken home the evening\u2019s award for Best Country Solo Performance. It\u2019s no secret the Nashville has star power her limber voice and the big, gestures on her debut, Hero, let her easily dominate a huge stage like the Grammys\u2019. Our small stage suited Morris and her songs just as well.",
        "Practice is a physical activity, of course, but it\u2019s also hard mental work \u2014 if you\u2019re doing it right. A new video published by TED Ed gets down to the scientific of what good practice looks like, and what it does to your brain. (Think axons and myelin, not \u201dmuscle memory\u201d \u2014 muscles don\u2019t have \u201dmemory. \u201d) As Annie Bosler and Don Greene, the creators of this TED Ed lesson, point out, this advice can apply to everything from music to sports.",
        "Rod Rosenstein, if appointed as deputy attorney general, could soon become the ultimate decider on the most politically sensitive subject in Washington. His confirmation hearing on Tuesday turned into a proxy war over the Trump administration\u2019s ties to Russia. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from any investigation into the election and Russian officials, leaving the tough questions for his deputy. Rosenstein\u2019s hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee focused less on his record as a Justice Department veteran and more on his superiors. \u201dHow can you investigate your boss?\u201d asked Sen.",

The documents published on Tuesday include instruction manuals, support documents, notes and conversations about, among other things, efforts to exploit vulnerabilities in smartphones and turn smart TVs into listening devices. The tools appear to be designed for use against individual targets, as part of the CIA\u2019s mandate to gather foreign intelligence.",
        "President Trump is offering some Twitter support for the Obamacare replacement plan put forward by House Republicans. In a tweet Tuesday morning, Trump described the GOP blueprint as \u201dOur wonderful new Healthcare Bill.\u201d He suggested it would be a welcome change from the Affordable Care Act, which he called \u201da complete and total disaster.\u201d \u201dI\u2019m proud to support the replacement plan released by the House of Representatives,\u201d the president said Tuesday afternoon during a White House meeting with GOP lawmakers.",
        "It took a lot to get to this point, but Republicans have released their health care bill. (For more on the policy, check out the NPR health team\u2019s reporting over at Shots.) The version that was released is likely to change as the bill goes through committees, but now that it\u2019s released, here are four potential challenges President Trump and Republicans face: 1. Health care is complicated, \u201dIt\u2019s an unbelievably complex subject. Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated.\u201d That\u2019s what President Trump told a gathering of governors about the health care system last week.",
        "House Republicans unveiled their replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act Monday night. They\u2019re calling it the American Health Care Act. Like the Affordable Care Act, it relies on tax credits to help with the cost of health insurance. But the proposed value of the credits is considerably lower than with the current law. The Republican plan may result in fewer people getting help to pay for their care. The proposed overhaul also gets rid of one of the most unpopular features of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 the tax penalty for not having health insurance.",
        "With two House committees set to take up the Republican replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act on Wednesday, party leaders have begun trying to sell the proposal to the American public. Leading the effort is President Trump, who met with Republican House leaders at the White House, saying he is \u201dproud to support the replacement plan released by the House of Representatives.\u201d Earlier, the President tweeted on Tuesday morning that the \u201dwonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation.\u201d The word negotiation is important. Congressional Democrats are uniformly opposed to the Republican makeover of Obamacare.",
        "An estimated 11 million immigrants live and work in the United States illegally. Their fate is one of the big policy questions facing the country. The story of how that population grew so large is a long one that\u2019s mostly about Mexico, and full of unintended consequences. Prior to the 1920s, the U. S. had few restrictions on immigration, save for a few notable exclusions. \u201dBasically, people could show up,\u201d says Jeffrey Passel, of the Pew Research Center. For workers in Mexico, crossing into the U. S. made a lot of economic sense, then and now.",
        "In 1944, World War II was dragging on and the Nazi forces seemed to be faltering. Yet, in military briefings, Adolf Hitler\u2019s optimism did not wane. His generals wondered if he had a secret weapon up his sleeve, something that would change the war around in the last second. Author Norman Ohler tells Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross that Hitler did have a secret, but it wasn\u2019t a weapon. Instead, it was a mix of cocaine and opioids that he had become increasingly dependent upon. \u201dHitler needed those highs to substitute [for] his natural charisma, which . ..",
        "A federal judge has denied a request by the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River tribes to halt construction of the final piece of the Dakota Access Pipeline. In a decision on Tuesday, U. S. District Judge James Boasberg denied the tribe\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction against the pipeline company. The tribes are arguing that the completion of the pipeline construction just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation endangers their drinking water source, part of the Missouri River called Lake Oahe, and that the pipeline has damaged cultural sites.",
        "Opponents of abortion rights have long argued that public funds for services like cancer screenings and contraception should go solely to health clinics that don\u2019t provide abortions. They\u2019ve made \u201ddefunding Planned Parenthood\u201d \u2014 or, to be more precise \u2014 blocking the organization from receiving funding through federal programs like Medicaid \u2014 a major goal. Now, Republicans in Congress have proposed an Affordable Care Act repeal that would, for one year, prevent Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid reimbursements for providing services like contraception and cancer screenings to patients.",
        "Last week, when news surfaced about various meetings between the Russian ambassador and members of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, Huffington Post editor Howard Fineman appeared on MSNBC and said, \u201dIf you think the Russian ambassador is just an ambassador, you haven\u2019t been watching The Americans.\u201d Well, I have been watching \u2014 and it\u2019s been fascinating from the start.

        "Brazil\u2019s recession was already of historic proportions. Today, government figures confirm that it has grown even worse. The economy last year actually dipped more sharply than expected. The national gross domestic product contracted by 3. 6 percent in 2016, statistics agency IBGE said Tuesday. \u201dThe numbers for 2015 were slightly worse,\u201d NPR\u2019s Philip Reeves reports from Brazil.",
        "Late last month, famine was declared in two counties of the torn East African country of South Sudan. With 100, 000 people at risk for dying of starvation in that area alone and millions more on the brink of food shortages throughout the country, South Sudanese President Salva Kiir promised \u201dunimpeded access\u201d to humanitarian aid organizations working there. A few days later the South Sudanese government hiked the fee for work permits for foreign aid workers from $100 to $10, 000. It\u2019s unclear whether the fee would apply only to newcomers or to those already there as well.",
        "Order in the court \u2014 but maybe not in movie theaters. With all the talk lately about politics and the judiciary \u2014 fights over Supreme Court vacancies, the President complaining about \u201d \u201d judges \u2014 I\u2019ve been thinking about the judges I\u2019ve seen on screen, and how their depiction might have intersected with public opinion through the years. Certainly, there was a time when judges were held in high esteem. When a teenage Mickey Rooney had a problem in the Andy Hardy movies, he turned to his onscreen dad, Judge Hardy."
