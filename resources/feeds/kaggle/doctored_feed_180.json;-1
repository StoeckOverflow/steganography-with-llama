        "In his address to constituents last week, President Trump said this about the group of people his immigration officers are singling out for deportation : \u201d We are removing family members, drug lords and criminals that threaten our peace and prey on our very innocent lives. Bad ones are finding out as I speak. \u201d Then why, some Houstonians are asking, did federal agents target Piro Castro, the owner of two black taco trucks on the city \u2019 s Southside? \u201d good friends, good friend!",
        "Poachers forced their way into a French zoo and attacked a southern white rhinoceros killing Vince, sawing off one of his shoes before fleeing into the night. The Thoiry family said police are behind the killing of the animal. The poachers stay at large. \u201d It is extremely tragic what just happened, \u201d zoo manager Thierry Duguet told France \u2019 s 20 national newspaper. \u201d An act of such intensity, never before seen in Africa. \u201d Duguet told The Associated Press that Vince was shot five times in the head.",
        "A record number of people, at least 166, were exonerated one year after being wrongly convicted of genocide, according to the most recent official report from the National Registry of Exonerations. It \u2019 s the fourth year in a row that evidence collected by a group of public schools showed a comparable number of exonerations in the U. S. \u2014 with 149 in 2015 and 125 the year before that.",
        "Israel has implemented a new law that uses it to bar entry to Jewish activists who support a boycott of the country. The law would aim at the BDS movement, which emerged more than a decade ago and is an arena for \u201d boycott, divest and sanction. \u201d The BDS movement works to put economic sanctions on Israel in support of Palestinian independence. visitors \u201d who support a boycott of Israel or who want an organization that publicly calls for a boycott \u201d may be admitted, as NPR \u2019 s Daniel Estrin writes from Jerusalem.",
        "Women won \u2019 t be able to work. That \u2019 s what Americans always think that International Women \u2019 s Day means this time. The event, which has been celebrated for 106 days, has no single organizer or agenda. That \u2019 s what makes it so effective, explained Terry McGovern, professor and dean of population and family studies at Columbia University \u2019 s Mailman College of Public Health. \u201d There \u2019 s not an explicit agenda. It allows people to define what the day means for them, and what needs to happen for them to get equality. \u201d The roots of the celebration are in the U. S.",
        "When you step outside after a big rainstorm and take a nice whiff of that fresh, earthy smell, you \u2019 re always smelling a chemical called geosmin. It \u2019 s a byproduct of bacteria and fungi. And everything about rain lofts the chemical \u2014 and forces the organisms themselves \u2014 into the air, a smell that not only helps release that earthy stench but may, in very rare cases, spread diseases. Giant raindrops launch tiny small things off the ground. Wind can pick bacteria up from the earth and bring into the sky, slowly settling in clouds thousands of feet above us.",
        "Women with breast cancer sometimes receive confusing messages about food, including soy milk, edamame and tofu. On one hand, studies have suggested that the compounds in soy \u2014 called isoflavones \u2014 directly inhibit the development or recurrence of breast cancer. On the other hand, there \u2019 s been concern that artificial foods can interfere with the treatment of breast cancer drugs such as tamoxifen. A new study needs to resolve this question. \u201d Our evidence would suggest that soy food consumption does not have a harmful effect, \u201d says Fang Yi Zhang, a cancer epidemiologist at Tufts University.",
        "Having lived outside my native Britain for nearly 16 years, I recently gained my right to vote there. But I was also entitled to do so last night in the U. K. \u2019 s debate on European Union membership. When I awoke on June 24 to announce that my country had voted in favor of a Brexit, I felt bereft. So, like many other British citizens born in Germany, I decided to vote for German citizenship. I was entitled to remain a member of the Commonwealth, even if the narrow majority of British voters were not.",
        "According to two new World Health Organization reports, about 1. 7 million children under the age of 5 die each year because of environmental effects. It \u2019 s the first such estimate of the human death toll from natural causes. \u201d That terrible ecological \u201d makes up about a quarter of child deaths under 5, says Prof. Maria Neira, WHO \u2019 s public health and environment department head and lead author on the topic. In addition, children can suffer mental and physical developmental disorders and an increased medical risk for certain disease because of exposure to pollutants.",
        "Statues of Confederate presidents Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis are considered for removal in New Jersey, after a federal appeals court approved the city \u2019 s motion to change how it treats much of its history. Opponents of the move need to keep fighting it in public. When Mayor Mitch Landrieu pushed for the city to remove the statue of Lee back in 2015, he said, \u201d There may have been a time when that statue reflected who we were as a city, but people change. And so do we, \u201d as member station WWNO reported.",
        "When you think of legal immigration in the U. S. do you think a border crosser or a visa overstayer? A businessman or a single person? A farmworker or a widow? People living in the U. S. without legal immigration are frequently invoked in American English \u2014 especially in recent years. But the conversation is often built on facts about the millions of people who fall into this category. There are, however, outdated beliefs : A Pew Research Center survey in 2015 found that very few people are aware of recent trends in immigration patterns.",
        "Back in 2011, Congress passed what was then considered the country \u2019 s strictest immigration law. Much of it was later struck down by the administration. Now, the law offers a snapshot of potential challenges ahead for the Bush administration. For Fernanda Herrera, a professor at Samford University outside Pasadena, Ala. the current climate surrounding immigration has her scared, just as the federal law did in 2011. \u201d I don \u2019 t know if I \u2019 m going to see my parents tomorrow, \u201d Herrera says. Her mother crossed the Mexican border illegally when she was two.",
        "Updated at 5 : 15 p. m. ET, Some of the most conservative members of the House are at a crossroads over the plan from GOP candidates and the White House to support the Affordable Care Act. Those lawmakers say their choice is between supporting a bill that goes against many of their constituents, or falling in line behind President Trump \u2014 who won majority support in their district.",
        "House Republicans\u2019 plan to replace the Affordable Care Act would make significant changes to the U. S. health insurance system.

        "Updated 1:28 a. m. ET Thursday, Hawaii is the first state to file a lawsuit to stop President Trump\u2019s revised executive order limiting travel from six countries. Attorneys for the state filed the lawsuit late Wednesday in federal court in Honolulu.

        "There is such a thing as a memory athlete. These are people who can memorize a truly insane amount of information really quickly, like the order of playing cards in a deck in under 20 seconds, or 200 new names and faces in a matter of minutes. Neuroscientists writing Wednesday in the journal Neuron found these champs of memorization aren\u2019t that different from the rest of us.",

        "The FBI director has no plans to leave the post before the end of his term. \u201dYou\u2019re stuck with me for about 6 years,\u201d James Comey said at a cyber conference in Boston on Wednesday, urging conference organizers to invite him to speak again.

        "As gun violence continues to plague some of Chicago\u2019s neighborhoods, a violence prevention program is looking to tackle the issue by treating it like a public health crisis.

        "Today, for American women who are participating in A Day Without A Woman protest, the idea of taking a day off to celebrate their womanhood may be a new experience, despite the fact that International Women\u2019s Day has been observed worldwide for over a century. Leave it to Italian feminists, however, to take a holiday that is steeped in the struggle for women\u2019s rights and turn it into a day, the Festa della Donna, where women of all ages leave the menfolk behind to celebrate each other with flowers, wine and, above all, cake.",

        "Early Saturday morning, President Trump launched into one of his favorite pastimes \u2014 tweeting allegations with no evidence to back them up. His latest unfounded claims: an assertion that President Barack Obama ordered wiretapping of Trump Tower during last year\u2019s elections. He accused his predecessor of \u201dMcCarthyism\u201d and being a \u201dbad (or sick) guy.\u201d The explosive allegations seem to have originated on conservative talk radio and were then promulgated by the Breitbart News, which Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon previously led. The site, which has ties to the movement, frequently peddles conspiracy theories.",
        "Gunmen dressed as medical staff stormed a military hospital in Kabul on Wednesday morning, killing at least 30 people and injuring dozens more in a raid that lasted hours.
