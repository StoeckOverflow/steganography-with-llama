        "Author Mohsin Hamid \u2019 s recent novel, Exit Politics, is about knowing when it \u2019 s time to abandon your country, and what happens when you speak to a nation that \u2019 s hostile to terrorism. It \u2019 s a topic the author himself is particularly familiar with. Hamid was born in Lahore, Pakistan, but spent part of his childhood in California. As a young adult, he lived in New York and London before returning to Lahore with his wife to raise their children.",
        "Spotlights that illuminate the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor went dark for more than an hour last night, prompting speculation over the cause : Was it to do with a protest on Black Women \u2019 s Day, or perhaps America \u2019 s immigration reform? A National Park Service official says they \u2019 re actively looking into it, but they suspect recent work on the electrical grid is the cause. \u201d The outage was most likely due to work related to an inadequate project to activate a permanent emergency backup system which is part of our last remaining Hurricane Sandy backup projects, \u201d the NPS says.",
        "Americans tend to fantasize that a future will free them from the clutches of men. But this illusion is incompatible with an America in which the general election was won by the candidate who ran a \u201d Make America Great Again \u201d campaign, which many people have pointed out was widely seen as a call to \u201d Make America White Again. \u201d If the election results are a vindication for those championing the politics of President Roosevelt, the demographic trends continue in the opposite direction.",
        "Witnesses to Wednesday \u2019 s car crash involving a commuter train and a bus report that the charter bus appears to be trapped on the tracks just north of the crash that killed at least four people and damaged dozens more in Biloxi, Miss. News agencies say the safety is a known problem. \u201d since 1976 there have been 16 collisions at this grade crossing leading to Tuesday \u2019 s accident, \u201d the National Transportation Safety Administration says. The train was moving at around 19 mph when it struck the bus and pushed the train vehicle some 200 feet down the line, the NTSB says.",
        "A top U. S. military official informed the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday that he received \u201d full responsibility \u201d for the critically criticized U. S. military raid into Yemen in early January. At the same time, Gen. Joseph Votel, the head of U. S.",
        "President Trump \u2019 s repeated and unsubstantiated claims over the months that Barack Obama had him wiretapped at Trump Tower at the height of last year \u2019 s election cycle set off alarms in the corridors of offices and also a constant challenge from lawmakers, former spymasters and journalists : Where \u2019 s your phone? Aides soon pointed to media reports for support, citing a most unlikely source : an article by a former British citizen who dryly notes that her campaign doesn \u2019 t back up Trump \u2019 s claim. That would be Louise Mensch, CEO of the libertarian political site Heat Street.",
        "The nation \u2019 s roads, bridges, airports, airports and transit systems are in really bad shape, compared to the civil engineers who construct and design such infrastructure. The final report card from the American Society of Civil Engineers gives the infrastructure of the United States a. That nearly anything grade should boost President Trump \u2019 s efforts to promote a plan to invest up to $ 1 trillion in rebuilding everything from roads and bridges to tunnels and tunnels, even though the labor \u2019 group is recommending something the president and his party are unlikely to accept : a huge increase in the congestion tax.",
        "\u201d This is the chance. This is a test, \u201d said the speaker, roving the audience with a wireless mic, gesturing at both the screen in front of him and the PowerPoint presentation behind him. TED Talk? infomercial? Nope \u2014 it was Deputy Speaker Paul Ryan, making a hard decision for his health care staff after a week of loud media criticism. After listening to political groups like the Citizens For Growth blast the program as a \u201d substitute for health services, \u201d Ryan went on speaking, saying this is just the first stage of an ongoing overhaul of the medical system.",
        "Got news about the GOP plan to overhaul mental health law? Join Congress on Twitter Thursday one. m. ET for our # ACAchat. Kaiser \u2019 s Tom Rovner, NPR \u2019 s Alison Kodjak and many policy analysts of many political persuasions will be online explaining how the Republican plan would work, who wins and who loses. See you there! After literally hundreds of promises, House Republicans have a bill they say will \u201d replace and replace \u201d the Affordable Care Act.",
        "The Republican health care overhaul making its way through the House is supported by Democrats and by many social conservatives. It \u2019 s none too popular with the professionals on the front lines of medical care, either \u2014 among doctors, nurses and students. The chief medical officer of Medicaid, Dr. Andrey Ostrovsky, tweeted out his opposition on Twitter. \u201d Despite political messaging from experts at HHS, I align with the experts... in opposition to # AHCA, \u201d the Clinton staffer said. Ostrovsky, who has been in his current job since September, has received praise from former Clinton administration officials for standing out.",
        "Vice President Pence has yet to begin a thorough investigation into allegations by Donald Trump that millions of Americans voted illegally in Texas. But that hasn \u2019 t stopped state lawmakers from taking action they say could limit voter registration, even though the President \u2019 s claims have been widely discredited. Legislation to allow voter ID and other benefits has already been introduced in about half the states this year. And in statehouse after statehouse, the scandal has had a familiar ring. \u201d We do not have a voter fraud problem in South Dakota, \u201d Democratic argues.",
        "The owners of a hotel bar in Washington, D. C. say they face intense competition from an unusual guest : the president of the United States. Diane Gross and Paul Pitts own the Cork Wine Bar, located about 20 blocks north of both the White House and the Donald Trump International Airport.

        "Earl Johnson II didn\u2019t grow up dreaming about becoming a famous singer: For a long time, he didn\u2019t even know he could sing. He discovered his talent almost by accident one night, at the recording studio he was working in as a producer. Now, Johnson performs under the stage name Earl St. Clair . But it was hard at first, which he sings about in the song \u201dAin\u2019t Got It Like That.\u201d He recalls, \u201dI was producing the single while people was trappin\u2019 chasing the dream and living for free.",
        "Updated at 4:06 p. m. ET, Washington state is asking a federal judge to apply the restraining order that temporarily halted President Trump\u2019s initial travel ban to the revised ban he signed Monday. In an announcement Thursday, Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson contended that Judge James Robart\u2019s Feb. 3 ruling \u2014 which suspended Trump\u2019s first ban nationwide until a challenge brought by Washington and Minnesota could be heard in court \u2014 ought to cover the second ban, despite revisions that narrowed who would be affected. The new ban is currently slated to go into effect on March 16.",
        "President Trump\u2019s head of the Environmental Protection Agency says he does not believe that carbon dioxide is a major cause of global warming. \u201dI would not agree that [CO2] is a primary contributor to the global warming that we see,\u201d Scott Pruitt said Thursday in an interview with CNBC\u2019s Joe Kernen. \u201dI believe that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do, and there\u2019s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact,\u201d Pruitt said.",
        "In 2013, Charlotte, N. C. police officer Randall Kerrick shot and killed Jonathan Ferrell, a black man who was unarmed. Video from a police car captured part of the encounter, but the shooting took place  . Kerrick was subsequently charged with voluntary manslaughter for shooting Ferrell, and the trial unfolded in 2015. A key piece of evidence was the video. But the way you see that video depends on who you are. On this episode of Embedded, we travel to Charlotte for the stories behind the night of the shooting, the trial, and the aftermath.",
        "Like so many countries from the former Soviet bloc, Mongolia faced a terrible economic upheaval at the end of the Soviet Union. In the first few years, inflation went up over 250 percent employment went down. And people started drinking much more heavily. \u201dAlcoholism was devastating during the economic hardships of the \u201990s,\u201d writes Jargalsaikhan Mendee, a political scientist and former Mongolian defense attach\u00e9 to the United States, in an email to Goats and Soda.

        "A noble beast gets shackled, from his island home and dragged to America in: In the new, comparatively unambitious Kong: Skull Island, the big guy finally claims a perk of his eight decades of stardom: He gets to do the entire picture from home. Indeed, this new Kong is at its mediocre best when it pretends to be a nature documentary about Skull Island\u2019s bizarro flora and fauna. One of its most captivating scenes has the big ape bathing himself in a river \u2014 at last, computer animators have learned to make convincing water!",
        "The quietly momentous film The Sense of an Ending began life as a sublimely achy short novel by British writer Julian Barnes (for whom it won the 2011 Man Booker prize) about an apparently unremarkable man with the aptly flavorless name of Tony Webster. Partially retired and on the cusp of old age, Tony receives a blast from his youthful past back in the 1960s that shatters his conveniently doctored memory of a act of vengeance wreaked on two school friends.",
        "As a lascivious man of the cloth in Brimstone, a rigorously unpleasant revisionist Western, Guy Pearce resembles a cross between Robert Mitchum\u2019s sinister preacher in The Night of the Hunter and Judge Holden in Cormac McCarthy\u2019s Blood Meridian. He\u2019s a figure of Old Testament wrath, an almost supernatural being who shapes and symbolizes this new world, mainly by committing atrocities under the banner of Protestant righteousness. As with Mitchum, his religious stature grants him the legitimacy to commit violence and sin, but he\u2019s not quite the same petty charlatan, grasping for a big score. He means what he says.",
        "The protagonist of Raw is a virgin and a vegetarian, and intent on becoming a veterinarian. Her path to that calling, however, leads through a place that\u2019s literally awash in blood. That site is not an abbatoir or a torture chamber, but the world\u2019s most disturbing veterinary college, a institution somewhere in Francophone Europe. (The movie\u2019s principal location is an actual vet school in Belgium.) Rather than a spot where kids learn to care for house pets, it\u2019s a training facility for industrial agriculture, packed with cows, horses, and cruelty.",
        "Scientists have taken another important step toward creating different types of synthetic life in the laboratory. An international research consortium reports Thursday that it has figured out an efficient method for synthesizing a substantial part of the genetic code of yeast. \u201dWe are absolutely thrilled,\u201d says Jef Boeke, a geneticist at New York University School of Medicine, who is leading the project. \u201dThis is a significant step toward our goal.\u201d The milestone is the latest development in the intensifying quest to create living, complex organisms from scratch in the lab.",

        "\u201dGreen Light\u201d this is not. One week after the release of that surprisingly sleek single, Lorde has released a somber piano ballad, \u201dLiability,\u201d and announced the release date of her new record, Melodrama: June 16. The song, about pushing the boundaries of a relationship, was inspired by Rihanna. \u201dI was in this cab alone listening to \u2019Higher\u2019 by Rihanna because Anti had just come out,\u201d she told Zane Lowe on Beats 1.",
        "Updated at 2:10 p. m. ET, WikiLeaks will be sharing alleged CIA hacking techniques with major technology companies such as Apple and Google to allow them to develop fixes for vulnerabilities in their phones and other electronic devices, according to Julian Assange. In a lengthy address from Ecuador\u2019s Embassy in London, where he remains holed up since 2012, the WikiLeaks founder said the group would work with manufacturers to \u201ddisarm\u201d purported CIA hacking tools.

        "In the span of 93 days, Chris Bertish crossed more than 4, 050 nautical miles of Atlantic Ocean \u2014 and he conquered this lonely crossing standing up. When the South African surfer entered English Harbour on the island of Antigua on Thursday, he was riding the same massive paddleboard that bore him from Morocco\u2019s Agadir Marina roughly three months ago. Still, if Bertish\u2019s equipment wasn\u2019t much different from when he started, his place in the record books now certainly is: On Thursday, Bertish became the first person in history to make a solo journey on a paddleboard.",
        "The Pentagon is sending about 400 Marines to Syria to help local fighters wrest control of Raqqa, which ISIS considers its capital. The Pentagon says the new troops will fire artillery rounds at ISIS fighters in support of the local forces, as well as provide security for the Marine artillerymen, as NPR\u2019s Phil Ewing reports. These 400 troops will bring the number of U. S. forces on the ground in Syria to about 900, Phil says.",
        "Ridership for U. S. programs was 10 times higher last year than it was in 2011, according to the National Association of City Transportation Officials. From 2011 to 2016, usage grew from 2. 3 million trips yearly to 28 million \u2014 numbers that dwarf the 320, 000 trips taken in 2010, the group says. Despite that explosive growth, bike sharing systems are generally seen as remarkably safe: A cyclist who was killed in an accident in Chicago last summer is believed to be the only traffic fatality.",
        "My father and I have a cheese habit. To feed this passion, and maybe save us some cash at the cheese counter, we decided it was time we learned to make the stuff ourselves. Our first goal: mozzarella. On a January morning we arrived at Flint Hill Farm in eastern Pennsylvania, ready for a crash course in cheese. The instructor and farm owner, Kathy Fields, met us in the dairy shop. She took on this farm in 1997 and a few years later began turning it into an educational center.",
        "Yesterday, on International Women\u2019s Day, most of my friends were in full empowerment mode. They were sporting red clothes, naming their top five women artists, and posting photos of mothers and daughters. But over in the jazz world, International Women\u2019s Day was a little more . .. awkward. We were busy attending to some much less celebratory women\u2019s business, a series of online events that we\u2019ll call the Saga of Musical Clitoris. Yes, according to some, there is \u201dmusical clitoris\u201d \u2014 though please don\u2019t worry if you\u2019ve never found yours."
