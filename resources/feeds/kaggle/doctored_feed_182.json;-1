        "The Affordable Care Act changed women \u2019 s medical care in some big ways : It stopped insurance companies from charging women less, forced insurers to cover maternity healthcare and contraceptives and allowed many women to get those contraceptives ( as well as a number of preventive services, like Pap smears and mammograms ) at equal cost. Now Republicans have the ability to repeal that law, popularly known as Obamacare. But that doesn \u2019 t mean all those worries will go away. In reality, many will remain. Confused?",
