        "This story was told at 5 : 45 p. m. U. S. Senator Preet Bharara, one of 46 federal judges asked to resign early, refused to step down, and was fired. \u201d I did not resign, \u201d Bharara tweeted. \u201d I was fired. Being the Senior Attorney in SDNY will forever be the high honor of my professional life. \u201d As the federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New Jersey, Bharara pursued a number of cases, including criminal trials against defendants like Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad, and won a $ 1.",
        "About half of all U. S. deaths from heart attack, stroke and Type 2 diabetes are linked to poor diets, according to a new study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association. And eating more \u2014 or taking \u2014 of just 10 types of food can possibly raise or lower the rate of death from these causes, the report found. Scientists at Tufts University identified the foods that seem to contribute the most to the risk. At the top of the list? Salt. Consuming too little salt was associated with 9. 5 percent of the deaths.",
        "You might be asking yourself, whatever happened to Deputy President Mike Pence \u2019 s investigation into President Trump \u2019 s disclosure that millions of people visited illegally in November? It \u2019 s been over a month since the president announced he would ask Pence to head a \u201d major investigation \u201d into those things and the overall issue of voter fraud. Well, well, not much has happened so far.",
        "To President Obama, bigger is better. He has inflated the height of his buildings ( counting ones that aren \u2019 t there ). He exaggerated the size of the space at his inauguration ( a million and a half \u2014 it wasn \u2019 t ). And he, of course, famously lashed out when he was tired of having small hands. ( If that meant something else would be small, he said during a widely televised debate, \u201d There \u2019 s no problem. I guarantee you. \u201d ) But when it comes to the health care bill, the Obama administration believes better is better.",
        "Once again, it was another tough week for national television news. Here \u2019 s our quick fix on the top stories. Senate scraps federal regulations, On Tuesday, the Senate voted to put back rules that modified and elaborated on a wide range of accountability provisions in the federal education system known as The Every Teacher Succeeds Act. The vote was unanimous, 50 to 49. To be clear, Congress is not scrapping or merely changing the law itself.",
        "On Christmas Eve, I found out that I was pregnant. It was the biggest present I could have asked for. My husband and I have wanted to make a family for years, and we could not wait to share the presents with our loved ones. But my first exhilaration quickly turned to sadness. As a physician, I knew one of the things that could go wrong. I wanted to do everything I could do to have a healthy baby. I found an obstetrician and made an appointment for my first prenatal visit.",
        "The Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act would cause significant changes to the U. S. health insurance structure. It would unwind many of the savings and coverage mandates of the law, collectively known as Obamacare. And it would significantly overhaul Medicaid. The bill would affect incomes and health outcomes for millions of Americans. Some Americans would be better off. Others would be worse off. The old bill could suffer as it makes its way through Congress, but here \u2019 s an early forecast of some of the winners and losers.",
        "Carfentanil is an opiate 10, 000 times more effective than morphine. And since last night, it \u2019 s been killing addicts and confounding first responders throughout the country. The drug was originally intended to be consumed by humans. But it has been used to kill and immobilize prisoners \u2014 reportedly, in assassination plots and by Russian Special Forces in 2002. They apparently used it in aerosol tanks as a knockout gas to initiate a hostage situation. Tragically, the drugs ended up killing more than 100 civilians. \u201d Carfentanil is a synthetic opioid.",
        "In an affable, man from Antioch, Mass. overdosed at his mom \u2019 s place after almost 25 years of heroin use. Joe Salemi had overdosed before, but this man couldn \u2019 t be revived. Salemi \u2019 s brother, Joseph, says he was pretty convinced when his brother died that there could have been something besides heroin in the syringe. The medical examiner later questioned it. \u201d I knew, deep in my head, it was going to be the stuff that someone \u2019 s talking about now \u2014 fentanyl, \u201d Anthony says. \u201d Because I never thought straight heroin would affect him. \u201d Anthony Salemi was familiar with fentanyl.",
        "The Velvet Underground and Nico, released 50 years ago tomorrow ( there is even some disagreement on the exact year ) is the definitive album. With a selection of songs \u2014 nearly all penned by frontman Lou Reed \u2014 and an iconic, cover photograph by band benefactor Andy Warhol, this jarring and disappointing collection was initially a moderate success at best, with no hit singles and a \u201d peak \u201d of No. 171 on NME \u2019 s albums chart in January 1967. But the world eventually came up with it, and for the past 30 years it \u2019 s had great placement on lists, like No.",

        "When Atoosa Moinzadeh filled out past census forms, she found herself in a racial identification conundrum. Moinzadeh identifies as Iranian American. But the census forms don \u2019 t have a box for Persian American. The closest she could come to identifying herself the way she wanted was to choose the name for \u201d white, \u201d which had \u201d Middle Eastern \u201d listed as an example. That wasn \u2019 t quite right for her. \u201d I \u2019 ve always classified as not white, and so the expectation to throw off \u2019 white \u2019 on forms has always felt accurate to me, \u201d Moinzadeh replied.",
        "A federal judge temporarily blocked enforcement of President Trump \u2019 s temporary travel ban on immigrants, but only as it applies to a family of Iraqi asylum seekers. The ruling, written by U. S. District Court Judge William M. Conley, said the wife and daughter of a Syrian Muslim man living in Wisconsin faced the possibility of \u201d suffering irreparable harm \u201d if the deportation order forced them to stay in Aleppo. It marks the biggest legal setback for Trump \u2019 s executive order on immigration, since its impact is limited to just the man and his family.",

The organizers of the privately run St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade in Boston have reversed course and will invite a group of LGBTQ veterans to participate in this year\u2019s event.

At the time, Lane didn\u2019t think much about it. He grew up on Cape Cod. Ticks are everywhere there in the summer. \u201dJust another tick bite. Not a big deal,\u201d he thought. That was June. In September, everything changed. \u201dI was working outside, and I just had a pounding headache,\u201d says Lane, 24, who works as a plumber and at a pizza restaurant. He tried taking ibuprofen.",
        "Saturday Night Live had a lot of goofy, apolitical fun Saturday, but took some time to take the occasional dig at the Trump administration. Anyone who\u2019s seen the movie Independence Day remembers the scene when President Thomas J. Whitmore, played by Bill Pullman, gives the ultimate inspirational speech to rally the troops \u2014 that against all odds, they can fight and defeat the evil aliens bent on destroying humanity. On Saturday, SNL imagined if President Trump were in that same position. Alec Baldwin returned as Trump, decked out in a flight jacket, as Trump has been seen wearing recently.",

        "When my daughter turned 1, a routine toe prick revealed that her iron levels were low. Because our family doesn\u2019t eat much red meat, the pediatrician advised that we feed our daughter spinach. Every. Single. Day. This was bad. My daughter had just entered a picky eating phase and leafy greens were \u201dyuck.\u201d Things were going poorly until I made popsicles. These frozen treats were chock full of blended spinach, peanut butter, yogurt, carrots, other miscellaneous healthy stuff, and blueberries, which conveniently turned the entire concoction purple. My daughter devoured the pops. Yes! Parenting win!",
        "Darvin Bentlage says his health insurance plan used to be the same as all the other cattle farmers in Barton County, Mo.: Stay healthy until he turned 65, then get on Medicare. But when he turned 50, things did not go according to plan. \u201dWell, I had a couple of issues,\u201d he says. He\u2019s putting it mildly. Over two years, he had Hepatitis C and diverticulitis.

While video games are the common interest that attracts millions of viewers to Twitch, players often become as big a draw as the game they\u2019re playing.",
        "Trekking season begins this month in the Himalayas, and visitors are sure to experience a common \u2014 if \u2014 sight: local porters carrying towering loads on their backs, often supported by a strap over their foreheads. Their packs are sometimes heavier than their bodies, says Norman Heglund, a muscle physiologist of Belgium\u2019s University de Louvain. Think: a pound pack on a man. And the porters carry their cargo up and down mountains, day after day, year after year. Trekkers often wonder how the porters manage such feats of strength and endurance.",
        "Did a thirst for lemonade, the beverage that launched a thousand childhood businesses, keep Paris safe from the bubonic plague? Did ergot poisoning lead to the Crusades? According to a new book by Tom Nealon, food writer and antiquarian bookseller, it\u2019s a distinct possibility. Nealon\u2019s book, Food Fights and Culture Wars, searches through patchy historical records to trace subjects like how chocolate led to war. In a chapter on \u201dcacao and conflict,\u201d Nealon traces some of the violent history spawned by a love of chocolate.",
        "A new report finds that the Republican bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act would reduce the federal deficit by $337 billion over a decade but would also leave 24 million more Americans uninsured during that same period. The uninsured estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office could create even greater political hurdles for the GOP bill. That legislation has already drawn opposition from major interest groups, health policy experts and even some GOP lawmakers.",
        "On Monday, as GOP leaders tried to rally Republican lawmakers to support their health care proposal, the Congressional Budget Office released a report showing that the plan would lead to an estimated 14 million fewer people with health insurance by next year.

        "The Truman Bowling Alley isn\u2019t glamorous or grand, but as bowling alleys go, the location is mighty exclusive. It\u2019s in the basement of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, inside the White House complex. And on Tuesday night it will be the latest backdrop for a high stakes sales pitch to a group of conservative House Republicans known as the Freedom Caucus. They are skeptical of what the president is selling: the American Health Care Act, or as Breitbart called it derisively, \u201dObamacare 2.",
        "Updated 6:30 p. m. ET, The Justice Department has asked for more time to respond to a congressional committee about any evidence that President Barack Obama ordered surveillance of Donald Trump last year, as Trump has claimed.

        "Much attention has been paid in recent years to Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. But Ukraine is not the only place where Russia has exploited ethnic conflicts and disputed territories along its borders. In the foothills of the Caucasus mountains, 2, 500 feet up, Russia is steadily building what it says is a new international border. It\u2019s marked by a hodgepodge of barbed wire fences, large green signs, hastily dug trenches and checkpoints. Villages are divided by it and people are regularly thrown in jail for crossing it.",

His enormous skeleton is on public display today at a London museum, part of a collection of anatomical specimens acquired by the eminent surgeon and scientist Dr. John Hunter, who died in 1793. The bizarre story of how Byrne\u2019s skeleton got there dismays medical ethicists.",
