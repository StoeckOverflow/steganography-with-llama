        "Sea ice in the Arctic has been melting at a minimum. Scientists blame a colder climate for most of that, but researchers have now worked out a natural cycle for how quickly sea ice melts.

Environmental scientists have always found a natural cause for change in the rate of Arctic warming. But nailing down just how much nature melting compared with greenhouse gases rising into the atmosphere has been difficult.",
