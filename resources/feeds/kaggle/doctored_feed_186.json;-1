If those changes don \u2019 t send a shiver up your spine, it means you \u2019 re not a high school senior or college freshman rushing to fill out the Federal Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA.

ET, The Republicans and Democrat leading the congressional investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election appeared reluctant to counter White House claims that there may have been attacks of some sort on Trump activities around the campaign, even if there was not specific wiretapping as President Trump said in a tweet nearly four weeks ago. However, the White House later defended the president \u2019 s assertions on Russia.",

        "Two weeks ago, a U. N. scientific agency determined that the popular weedkiller glyphosate probably contained cancer. That finding from the Federal Agency for Research on Cancer caused an international uproar. Monsanto, the company that invented glyphosate and still makes most of it, unleashed a fierce campaign to discredit the IARC \u2019 s policies. New details of the organization \u2019 s counterattack came to light this day. Internal company reports, released as part of a campaign against the company, show how Monsanto enlisted outside scientists to continue defending the safety of glyphosate, including under the brand name Roundup.",

        "Blizzards and deep snow walloped the East Coast this time, and for glade skiers, the late blast of cold was a joy. Glades are steep, steep trails, sort of a cross between a route and the downhill path you find at groomed ski slopes. These days, you can find glades at mountain resorts. But the most beautiful are miles away in remote, dense forests, far from the trail and the chairlifts. One of the most popular in the state is Lyon Mountain, situated in a remote corner of the Adirondacks in upstate New York.",

        "With the Senate Judiciary Committee set to open hearings on the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U. S. Supreme Court, the game of confirmation cat and mouse is about to begin. Senators will try to get a fix on Gorsuch\u2019s legal views \u2014 and the nominee will try to say as little as possible. Supreme Court scholars and practitioners on the right and left may disagree about whether they want to see Gorsuch confirmed, but in general there is little doubt about the nominee\u2019s conservatism. Indeed, his conservative pedigree is the reason he was picked.",
        "In 2016, a mass bleaching event caused unprecedented destruction to the Great Barrier Reef and other coral reefs around the world. Now, a new study in Nature has concluded that securing a future for coral reefs \u201dultimately requires urgent and rapid action to reduce global warming.\u201d It finds that local measures, such as protecting reefs and water quality, ultimately yield little protection against bleaching caused by higher water temperatures. The researchers documented the extent of the damage the reef off the coast of Australia sustained during the 2016 bleaching event, and found that only 8.",

Flynn sat next to Russian President Vladimir Putin during dinner at the event. The speaking engagement was held in December 2015, just two months before Flynn became a formal adviser to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.",

        "Updated: 5:08 p. m. ET, The Trump administration\u2019s new budget blueprint aims to quantify the president\u2019s nationalistic agenda in dollars and cents. The plan, released Thursday morning, calls for significant increases in military and spending, along with corresponding cuts in many other parts of the government. The blueprint was designed to \u201dsend a message to our allies and our potential adversaries that this is a administration,\u201d Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney explained on Wednesday as he previewed the document in a briefing with reporters.",
        "This morning President Trump released a proposed 2018 budget that calls for a $9 billion, or 13. 5 percent, cut for the U. S. Department of Education. The document released today is only an initial sketch \u2014 a proposal, really \u2014 one that must compete with Congress\u2019s own ideas. It indicates how Trump plans to make good on his pledge to dramatically reduce parts of the federal government while increasing military spending. And, it provides some direction on how the administration plans to promote school choice, the president\u2019s signature education issue.",

        "Updated at 4:02 p. m. ET, If there was any doubt over President Trump\u2019s views on climate change, those doubts evaporated with the unveiling of his proposed federal budget on Thursday. The budget would end programs to lower domestic greenhouse gas emissions, slash diplomatic efforts to slow climate change and cut scientific missions to study the climate. \u201dIt\u2019s terrible from the perspective of having any concern at all about climate change,\u201d says Andrew Light, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute\u2019s climate program and a professor at George Mason University.",

        "Updated at 4:30 p. m. ET Friday, President Trump\u2019s second attempt at a \u201dtravel ban\u201d was supposed to go into effect Thursday. Instead, the central components of the executive order have been blocked by judges on opposite sides of the country. In both cases, the judges relied heavily on public statements from Trump and his advisers to conclude that the order \u2014 despite being \u201dfacially\u201d neutral on religion \u2014 was designed to target Muslims.
