        "Ask any female lawyer about her worst victim, and you \u2019 ll hear this : the client who digs a grave for himself \u2014 and then keeps on digging. The possibility of defending a difficult client is once again in the news this week as the Justice Department has struggled to persuade federal judges that President Trump \u2019 s executive orders, imposing limits on foreigners from six majority Muslim countries, is not, in fact, a law on Muslims.",
        "The president and CEO of USA Gymnastics has resigned, partly after an investigative report by The Indianapolis Star alleged that the program ignored reports of child abuse by adults engaged in the sport, including students and a prominent doctor. Kevin Penny, who served as the club \u2019 s head for more than a decade, submitted his resignation on Thursday. In a letter, Penny did not apologize or admit any wrongdoing.",
        "Environmentalists love \u201d cover crops. \u201d These are plants that maintain cool weather and stay on farm fields after the trees are harvested. They hold the weeds in place and are probably the most efficient way to keep crops in fields, rather than polluting small streams. Unfortunately, the typical farmer doesn \u2019 t love these trees quite so much. The Agriculture Working Group, a research and advocacy organization, studied satellite images of the plant and found that farmers in Virginia and Illinois had planted wild crops on less than five percent of their corn and soybean crops.",
        "Surely, Oakhurst Dairy must have done well to heed the exact words of the \u2019 80s hair salon Cinderella : \u201d Don \u2019 t know what you need ( till it \u2019 s gone ). \u201d The egg and cream company headquartered in Portland, Maine, apparently never appreciated the hair comma \u2014 also known as an ice comma \u2014 so much as it did Monday, when the success of that little curved line cost the company an early court ruling that decided on overtime rules for employees.",
        "Rising drugs prices are one of the major challenges in health care in the United States. More people are using prescription medication on a regular basis, and the price of specialty drugs are growing faster than inflation. President Donald Trump has tried over and over again to drive down drug prices. Just last week on business he wrote : \u201d I am working on a better system where there will be competition in the Healthcare Industry.",
        "Microscopic, animals like tardigrades are one of the most resilient animals on Earth. Known colloquially as water bears, they can survive extreme temperatures, radiation, even a trip to outer space. The creatures are famous for their capacity to withstand extremely cold conditions. Water bears can go without oxygen for 10 years, surviving as a dessicated creature. Just how they come back to life when their environment is friendlier has baffled scientists for ages. Now researchers think they have the technology, and it may someday help us ship pharmaceuticals more safely.",
        "Silicon Valley, a region that attracts a significant population from across the continent and world due to its high tech sector, faces an existential question with consequences : how might its mix of cultures support local policing? Some local history has created middle ground for such a question. In 2008, Palo Alto \u2019 s police chief formally retired after a controversial proposal for officers to specifically cover men. Last year, Stanford researchers concluded that Oakland police departments were more likely to handcuff, search and capture men than any other group.",
        "This frog often lights up a room. The North American polka dot mimic frog initially seems unremarkable. But researchers in Argentina soon got a huge reaction when they shone an ultraviolet light on it, confirming that the creature is actually breathing and glows bright. The fluorescence is \u201d unprecedented \u201d in amphibians, the scientist said in a recent study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It means that \u201d electromagnetic radiation is reflected and then reemitted at longer wavelength. \u201d The phenomenon had previously been documented well in certain fishes and marine turtles, though not in amphibians.",
        "Nearly seventy years ago, the nation \u2019 s leading group of obstetricians and gynecologists prepared a policy statement saying the time had come for breast contraception to be available without a label. We wrote about it and everything. In the intervening decades, some states have changed their law. California authorized pharmacists to monitor most types of hormonal birth control. Oregon passed a separate law covering both pads and patches. But neither state changed the status of birth control pills from pill to. Only the Food and Drug Administration can do that.",
        "Updated at 6 : 55 p. m. ET, A post on Trump \u2019 s corporate Twitter feed caused a stir Saturday morning, denigrating President Obama and calling for Barack Obama \u2019 s return. The tweet was up for about 20 minutes only \u2014 but in that period, it was liked and retweeted more than 1, 000 times. \u201d You are quite a disgusting excuse of a name and we would love to have @ BarackObama back, \u201d said the tweet, which was briefly elevated to the top of the McDonald \u2019 s line.",
        "NPR \u2019 s Carly Simon spoke to Joe Cotton in 2013. Hear an encore of their recording at the audio link. Arthur Cotton, one of the best blues harmonica players of the 20th century, died unexpectedly of pneumonia while being treated at St. David \u2019 s Medical Hospital in Austin, Texas. He was 81 years old. A note from Cotton \u2019 s label, Alligator Records, announces his passing. The Grammy winner was born July 1, 1935, on a Virginia cotton plantation and began playing the harmonica at age 9.",
        "Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte gave a sharp defeat to Chancellor Geert Wilders in what was seen as the first of two electoral tests of populism on the African continent this year. Rutte \u2019 s VVD list took 33 out of 150 seats in the lower house of the Dutch parliament. Wilders \u2019 Party for Freedom gained 20 seats and came in third. The Dutch Labor Party, took a major blow, losing 29 seats. The GreenLeft party gained 10.

        "Prime Minister Mark Rutte\u2019s party is celebrating a resounding win over populist Geert Wilders\u2019 Party for Freedom, in a result that\u2019s being welcomed by centrists and progressives in France and Germany, which will also hold national elections this year. \u201dI warmly congratulate @markrutte for his clear victory against extremism,\u201d French President Francois Hollande tweeted Thursday. \u201dThe Netherlands, oh the Netherlands you are a champion!\u201d tweeted Peter Altmaier, chief of staff for German Chancellor Angela Merkel.",
        "Forget basketball. March Mammal Madness may be more than the NCAA\u2019s version of March Madness. Sure, basketball players can jump. But can they jump like the giant pouched rat, which leaps 5 feet in the air? Not only that, the weighing in at around 3 pounds, can sniff out land mines and identify TB in sputum samples. In the first round of the mammal tournament, the pouched rat (seeded 11th in its bracket of 16) took on the fox (seeded 6th).",
        "If you had to rank Harriet Tubman and Kanye West in order of blackness, who would be first? Who\u2019s blacker, Malcolm X or Martin Luther King Jr.? These are the type of questions a new card game, Trading Races, asks players to ponder. The rules are simple: Each player gets five cards from a deck each card has the image of a different famous person. In every round, participants take turns throwing down one card.",
        "When Stephen Bosio of Pasadena, Calif. fed his son a pasty, the act felt, by his assessment, more important than it should have. \u201dTeddy is a fifth generation man,\u201d Stephen told me. Outside the rural Midwest, the term \u201dpasty\u201d is associated with a particular type of nipple cover rather than a pastry shell stuffed with ground beef and root vegetables, although the pronunciations of these terms differ. The food variety, ironically, rhymes with \u201dnasty\u201d rather than \u201dtasty.\u201d In Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula (U.",
        "A Norwegian fund that manages government employees\u2019 pensions has decided to remove its investments from the companies behind the Dakota Access Pipeline, a move that was reportedly inspired by pressure from Norway\u2019s indigenous Sami peoples. The pipeline is being built by Energy Transfer Partners, or ETP. Allowing the pipeline to cross the Missouri River in North Dakota was opposed by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, which argued the route would threaten the tribe\u2019s water sources and sacred sites. After legal challenges and lengthy protests, the pipeline\u2019s construction was halted, but the project was reinstated by the Trump administration.",
        "It wasn\u2019t the common ground that German Chancellor Angela Merkel was looking for. When President Trump was asked at their joint press conference Friday about the White House claims that President Obama had enlisted British intelligence in spying on him, Trump looked toward Merkel and quipped, \u201dAt least we have something in common, perhaps.\u201d Trump was referring to reports that the National Security Agency had tapped the German leader\u2019s phone during the Obama administration. Merkel wasn\u2019t laughing. It was the second awkward moment on Friday between the United States and a European ally.",
        "Updated at 4:50 p. m. ET, At a and occasionally tense news conference after their first meeting Friday, President Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed trade and border policy \u2014 and had one notable exchange when Trump was asked about his unproven claims that former President Obama tapped the phones at Trump Tower last year.",
        "The Trump administration is appealing a federal judge\u2019s decision to temporarily block the president\u2019s second travel ban from going into effect \u2014 setting up another legal showdown in an appeals court. The first version of the ban, temporarily suspending the U. S. refugee program and barring entry into the U. S. from residents of seven countries, was quickly blocked by a federal judge in Washington state. The Justice Department appealed that temporary restraining order, but a panel of judges from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the suspension of the ban.",
        "Updated at 3:25 a. m. ET Sunday, Late Saturday night, another person threatening the White House was taken into custody, making the third threat in just over a week, and the second in one day. The Secret Service says a driver was detained after \u201da suspicious vehicle\u201d approached a White House checkpoint, according to Reuters. CNN, which first reported the incident, cites two law enforcement sources who said the man claimed to have a bomb in the vehicle. There was no confirmation of an explosive, CNN reports. Earlier Saturday, U. S.",
        "No matter how you slice it, outbreaks are becoming more common. Overseas, there\u2019s been Ebola, Zika and yellow fever. And here at home, we\u2019re seeing a surge in diseases, with Lyme leading the way. For the past month, NPR has been looking at why this is the case. Deforestation lets animal viruses jump into people. Factory farming amplifies the problem. And then international tourism spreads the new diseases around the globe. But throughout our series, there\u2019s been something else on people\u2019s minds. Listeners and readers sent in 250 questions about pandemics.",
        "Earth Day is coming up on April 22. It\u2019s an occasion to think about the risks we all face from climate change \u2014 and to recognize the toll these problems take on the people in the developing world, who are especially vulnerable. When oceans rise, when drought strikes, the consequences can be dire. People are losing their homes and becoming climate refugees, losing their crops, losing their water sources. insects are moving into new territory. \u201dPeople who are poorly off are always going to bear the brunt when things go badly,\u201d says Dr.",
        "There\u2019s high drama in Florida over a prosecutor\u2019s decision not to seek the death penalty for a man accused of killing a police officer. And the Florida governor\u2019s decision to assign a different state attorney to the case is reigniting Florida\u2019s death penalty debate yet again, after the law spent a contentious year in court. For much of last year, executions in Florida were on hold. That\u2019s because Florida\u2019s Supreme Court said the way judges and juries decided on the death penalty was unconstitutional.",
        "Kiev\u2019s Solomyansky District Court is a pink building squeezed between an Orthodox church with golden domes and the soaring office tower of Ukraine\u2019s tax service. \u201dIt\u2019s a very symbolic place,\u201d said Maxim Eristavi, a journalist and activist, as he returned to the site of a dramatic standoff that took place in early March. Inside the court, a judge was preparing to rule on extending the detention of Roman Nasirov, the suspended head of Ukraine\u2019s State Fiscal Service.",
        "At a ceremony in New York on Thursday, one of America\u2019s most celebrated writers had a new reason to celebrate. Louise Erdrich won the 2017 National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction for her novel LaRose, the story of an accidental shooting \u2014 and the fraught tale of family and reparation that follows. Erdrich, who already has an NBCC Award to her name for her debut novel, Love Medicine, wasn\u2019t the only author to be feted on Thursday.

        "This Friday is Match Day, an annual rite of passage for seniors in medical school, when they find out at noon if they\u2019ve \u201dmatched\u201d with a residency in the specialty and location of their choice. But many of those being matched will be happy to go pretty much anywhere. They are international medical graduates \u2014 either U. S citizens who\u2019ve attended school out of the country (think the Caribbean or Mexico) or doctors who are citizens of other countries and want to train here. Though getting into medical school in the U. S.",
        "Dr. Amin Rabiei knew he wanted to work in medicine from an early age. When he was growing up in Iran, he watched his dad experience seizures and his mom struggle to help. Rabiei went on to medical school in Iran, then practiced at a rural clinic there, all the while working toward an important career point that culminates Friday: getting matched to a medical residency training program in the United States.",
        "David Higginbotham contracted hepatitis C more than 35 years ago. He\u2019d like to rid his body of the virus, but Colorado\u2019s Medicaid program says he\u2019s not sick enough to justify the cost. And he\u2019s not alone. Since 2013, when Gilead Sciences Inc. released Sovaldi, the first medication that can reliably cure hepatitis C, health insurers and state Medicaid programs have been coming up with ways to limit access to it and a sister drug, Harvoni, because they\u2019re priced so high \u2014 more than $80, 000 for a course of Sovaldi at the outset.",
        "From time to time in Hirokazu \u2019s gently incisive family drama After the Storm, the soundtrack produces a few bars of casual whistling backed by a soft fragment of melody that noodles along with its lead character, stalled novelist and private detective Ry\u00f4ta Shinoda (Hiroshi Abe). As he bumbles through another dispiriting day in the life, we learn that a typhoon is on its way to the Japanese town where he lives."
