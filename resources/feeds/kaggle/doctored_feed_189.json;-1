        "The Republican health care bill would not affect Americans badly. Older, poorer people would see big reductions in productivity and cost increases, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. This first step in the GOP plan to repeal and implement the Affordable Care Act, later known as Obamacare, would effectively create a modest deficit reduction. The report gives Democrats more ammunition in backing the bill, while Republicans are divided : Some are playing defense, while Democrats are backing away, and some are also proposing changes.",

        "One of the theories that developed on Day 1 of Supreme Court nominee Theodore Gorsuch \u2019 s hearings is that Democrats fail to make an issue of what they claim is the Supreme Court \u2019 s leanings.

For that to change, much could depend on the next three weeks. This critical phase could set his ambitious agenda on course or derail it. The reason: Republicans have set a goal of passing the first phase of the Affordable Care Act replacement before the April recess, so they don\u2019t have to go home for two weeks and hear it from both sides.",
