        "Thursday will mean seven years since President Obama introduces the Affordable Care Act before a debate in the East Room of the White House. It was the signature day moment of his presidency, underscored by President Biden, who whispered into the president \u2019 s ear that it was a \u201d big f * * * * * * thing. \u201d The mic picked up the remark, which created quite a stir. Now, Republicans hope to mark the day with a successful House motion to repeal the law known as Obamacare.",

ET, Explosive accusations and countercharges on Putin threatened to derail one of two \u2019 investigations into the potential conflict between President Trump \u2019 s 2016 presidential aides and Russia \u2019 s meddling in the election.

        "A Russian diplomat paid former Clinton campaign chairman Thomas Manafort millions of dollars to advance the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Associated Press reports. The first allegations arise soon after Manafort resigned from the campaign citing concerns over his work for a Communist party in Ukraine. \u201d according to documents that we \u2019 ve reviewed, John Manafort secretly worked for a Ukrainian oligarch who wanted him to promote Ukrainian interests, \u201d the AP \u2019 s Mike Day tells NPR \u2019 s Rachel Martin.",
        "School programs must give kids with disabilities the chance to make meaningful, \u201d appropriately ambitious \u201d progress, the Supreme Court said Wednesday in an opinion. The decision in Endrew F. E. Douglas County School District could have allowed for the 6. 5 million students with disabilities in the United States. The decision centered on a child with autism and attention deficit disorder whose parents removed him from public school in third grade. He went on to show better progress in a free school.",

Barring an utterly unforeseen time when the questioning resumes Wednesday, voters expect Judiciary committee approval along Republican lines on April 3 and a surprising win on the Senate floor. Twenty senators took turns asking questions for half an hour each. The Democrats tried to get the senators to share their affinity for the presidency. The Democrats tried to compare him to President Trump.",

        "In August 2016, an outbreak of mumps began in Arkansas. Since then, there have been nearly 3, 000 cases of the condition across 33 counties in the country. As a public health scientist, I wondered : Why did this outbreak go off? My team at HealthMap, a computational epidemiology firm based out of Boston Children \u2019 s Hospital, began by rounding up as many data as we could. We soon discovered that the Arkansas Department of Health was releasing quarterly reports on the outbreak.",
        "Angela regularly makes money hawking her services to important people, establishing a consulting firm that makes companies connect with America \u2019 s power players. So it finally attracted notice when Trump spent nearly $ 16 billion recently to buy a Michigan Avenue penthouse owned by Donald Trump himself. The February story, which was first reported by Quincy Jones, underscores one of the risks posed by Trump \u2019 s large business interests. Trump famously made his money in real estate, a place where prices inevitably fluctuate, making it possible to hide secrets to influence the president.",

S. specifically as domestic workers on farms. WAFLA takes care of the bureaucratic details. It asks for permission from the Department of Justice to bring in workers for government jobs. It certifies that it has looked for U. S. citizens to do these jobs and can \u2019 t use them. Then it locates people in places like Mexico, or Central America.",
        "It \u2019 s not every day that the world gets a special tool that could hurt 100, 000 children each year. And it \u2019 s probably not every day that the addition to that tool is the same thing that made space ice made so memorable. Sounds familiar. But bear with me a moment. People say they have a new tool that \u2019 s about 70 percent effective against rotavirus \u2014 a toxic little pathogen that gives us bad diarrhea here in the U. S. but killed more than 200, 000 children each year in different countries. This oral vaccine isn \u2019 t the first for rotavirus.",

This was the first full conference of the Global Coalition on the Defeat of ISIS since 2014, and a chance for the Trump Administration to flesh out what it wants to do next. So far, it is mainly stepping up a fight that the Obama administration put in motion. But the agenda is certainly different.",
        "Connie Dotts is a big fan of her insurance. \u201dI like that we can choose our own doctors,\u201d says the resident of Mesa, Ariz. \u201dThey also have extensive mental health coverage.\u201d Dotts isn\u2019t on some pricey plan, either.

Hundreds of musicians played throughout the week, for crowds big and small. One of this year\u2019s showcases was the first in the festival\u2019s history to feature a lineup made up entirely of artists.

        "I\u2019ll be honest at first, I feared the whole series was a bit of a dodge. Watching the first episode of Shots Fired \u2014 Fox\u2019s highly anticipated limited series about a federal investigation into a police shooting in a small North Carolina town \u2014 one thing became clear rather quickly. The shooting, which draws two hotshot investigators from the Department of Justice, involves the town\u2019s only black police officer, who kills an unarmed, white .",
        "For the first time in birds, researchers say they have found evidence that a New Zealand parrot has the avian equivalent of an infectious laugh. They call it \u201dpositive emotional contagion\u201d \u2014 which they define as \u201doutwardly emotional actions that spread from one individual to another.\u201d In humans, this is what happens when one person hears another laugh and also starts cracking up. And in research published in Current Biology, the researchers say that when kea parrots hear a call associated with play, they start playful tussling, aerial acrobatics, or throwing objects into the air.",
        "By a largely vote Tuesday, the Senate approved a bill that repeals hunting restrictions on national wildlife refuges in Alaska. The House already voted last month to abolish those restrictions \u2014 which were instituted by the Fish and Wildlife Service in 2016 to protect predator species from hunters \u2014 and so the bill now heads to the desk of President Trump, who is widely expected to sign it. The FWS rule facing repeal explicitly prohibited many kinds of \u201dpredator control\u201d on the 16 federally owned refuges in Alaska.",

        ", Men may soon be able to take their own sperm count \u2014 at home. With a smartphone. Yes, there\u2019s an app for that. You may be asking yourself, why? Low sperm count is a marker for male infertility, a condition that is actually a neglected health issue worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Current methods to diagnose male infertility require laboratory equipment that can cost up to $100, 000. On top of that, standard methods often require a specially trained technician. A team of researchers at Harvard is trying to change that.",
