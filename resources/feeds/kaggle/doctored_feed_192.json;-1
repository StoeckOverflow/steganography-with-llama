        "President Trump got good word on Thursday from the federal commission that oversees the lease on his building in Washington, D. C. The General Services Administration wrote in a letter that the Trump Administration is in \u201d full compliance \u201d with the lease on the luxury hotel that \u2019 s located just blocks from the White House. Many ethics and business experts have called upon GSA to end the lease, saying that the contract language also says no \u201d elected representatives of the Government of the United States...",
        "Updated at 11 a. m. ET Friday, The U. S. Treasury Department has signed and passed a presidential permit to use the Keystone XL pipeline.

Pipeline company TransCanada says that in accordance with the Trump administration getting off on its pipeline, it will drop a lawsuit for more than $ 15 billion that it filed under the North American Free Trade Agreement.

        "The outlook for a full congressional investigation into alleged ties between President Obama and Russia \u2019 s election meddling put in doubt Thursday, after an election, flap involving its top two members. Senate Chairman Devin Nunes,. has formally apologized for briefing Trump, on what he sees as evidence that Trump and his aides were wrapped up in U. S. surveillance activity, while keeping his committee in the dark. And ranking member Mark Schiff,. appeared to confirm reports that the U. S. has serious evidence of coordinated activities between the Trump campaign and Russia during the elections.",
        "U. S. artillery artillerymen are now in place on Syrian Hill, north of the last days of the Islamic State. A force of local Kurdish and Azerbaijani fighters is moving eastward, continuing to isolate the city of Raqqa. They \u2019 re in the planning stages of a major terrorist operation that officials said could last into the future. What comes next is going to have huge implications not only for the security of ISIS but also for the relationship between ISIL and Russia, as well as the clear outlines of the future Iranian state. It will be very complicated.",
        "Dr. Hussam a Pakistani psychiatrist, writes poems that reflects his deep love for a lost homeland. \u201d literature and art is another way to cope, \u201d he says, \u201d we are all grieving in our own ways. The country is no longer the thing that I left and it still haunts me in my memory. \u201d ( Click here to read one of his thoughts. ) He has turned his grief into an elaborate plan.",
        "With his skill as a teacher, Dr. Hussam is reaching out to the sick people of his Syrian country, offering guidance for healthcare workers who work with difficult health issues in a region traumatized by war. And with his love of music, he tries to capture his feelings for his homeland in poetry.

Parliament has been identified by Britain \u2019 s Metropolitan Police as Khalid Masood, 52. Police believe the shooter acted alone.

        "To fully reach the appeal of Power Rangers, the first iteration of the media and technology in two decades, fans must sit through at least one or two of the Michael Michael Transformers releases, which is by no means an advisable experience. The two franchises are more or less the same \u2014 a sprawling assemblage of thinly wrought characters, unforgivably complicated mythology, and barely comprehensible battle sequences, all in service of two battlebots for kids to smash away in the sandbox. Neither one is aware of the remainder bins in which they \u2019 ll inevitably sit.",
        "\u201d Space is war and danger wrapped in terror and silence, \u201d Chief Information Officer Leonard \u201d Bones \u201d McCoy once lamented. And that was on Star Trek, far and away the most absurd vision of humanity \u2019 s spacefaring past ever presented onscreen. Even more prevalent in movies is the level of \u2019 t pessimism peddled by Life, a nasty nailbiter that meant those with the Right Stuff were in the wrong places. It \u2019 s Alien in. It \u2019 s Gravity with a hostile \u2014 and apparently intelligent \u2014 Martian jellyfish.",
        "Brutal in both subject matter and presentation, the biopic I, Olga tells the story of the last man to be given the death penalty in Czechoslovakia. Olga Hepnarova, a suicidal who pushed her truck onto a downtown sidewalk and killed four pedestrians in 1973, attributed her act of serial murder to her own sense of alienation from the city. To communicate this, it \u2019 s understandable that directors Tom\u00e1s Weinreb and Petr Kazda also choose to, well, alienate their fans.",
        "The namesake of Woody is the kind of guy people try to avoid on the streets, at the sidewalk cafe, or while using the adjacent urinal. Yet the characters of this deadpan comedy want us to spend 90 minutes with him. The irony isn \u2019 t painful, but it is a little frustrating. Like the reclusive, misanthropic, yet oddly gregarious main character, Woody Harrelson is as handsome as the man \u2019 s personality suggests. But Wilson struggles with tone, shifting from monotonously bleak to predictably humorous to improbably sanguine.",
        "Updated at 5:45 p. m. ET, On the final day of the confirmation hearings for Judge Neil Gorsuch, the Senate Democratic leader announced his opposition to the Supreme Court nominee. In a speech on the Senate floor, Chuck Schumer said Gorsuch \u201dwill have to earn 60 votes for confirmation,\u201d setting up a showdown with Republican leaders who may attempt to change Senate rules. If Gorsuch \u201dcannot earn 60 votes, a bar met by each of President Obama\u2019s nominees and George Bush\u2019s last two nominees, the answer isn\u2019t to change the rules,\u201d Schumer said.",
        "Growing up in a hungry household in the first couple of years of life can hurt how well a child performs in school years later, according to a new study. An estimated 13. 1 million children live in homes with insufficient food, according to the most recent figures from the U. S. Department of Agriculture. Many of those children experience hunger during their first few years of life, or their parents are hungry and stressed out about food during those years \u2014 the most crucial time for a child\u2019s development.",
        "Things are coming to a boil. If you listen closely, you can hear the chatter on the streets, in coffee shops or in meetings: Musicians are raising their voices to protest again. I heard it when I was a teen during the Vietnam War, when musicians wore their passions on their sleeves in speaking out against an unpopular war. I\u2019ve heard it at various times since then, coming largely from Latin America. But now a new generation of artists is finding an audience for music with a message.",
        "The 2015 hit \u201dClassic Man\u201d introduced the world to Jidenna. His look matched his sound: suits, ascots and red hair slicked down in a wave that would\u2019ve made Nat King Cole jealous. At one point, a friend\u2019s manager took him aside and said he thought Jidenna had a ton of potential as an artist \u2014 but there was just one problem. \u201dHe said, \u2019You\u2019re too perfect,\u2019 \u201d Jidenna says.",
        "In 2015, when researchers Anne Case and Angus Deaton discovered that death rates had been rising dramatically since 1999 among white Americans, they weren\u2019t sure why people were dying younger, reversing decades of longer life expectancy. Now the economists say they have a better understanding of what\u2019s causing these \u201ddeaths of despair\u201d by suicide, drugs and alcohol. In a to their groundbreaking 2015 work, they say that a lack of steady, jobs for whites without college degrees has caused pain, distress and social dysfunction to build up over time.",
        "A former Russian parliamentarian named Denis Voronenkov, who fled Russia last October and has criticized President Vladimir Putin\u2019s government, was killed in Kiev on Thursday, in an apparent assassination that Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko is reportedly calling \u201dstate terrorism.\u201d Voronenkov, 45, had just left the Premier Palace hotel when he was shot twice in the head on a sidewalk along a busy street in Ukraine\u2019s capital, according to the Kyiv Post.

        "Cancer can be caused by tobacco smoke or by an inherited trait, but new research finds that most of the mutations that lead to cancer crop up naturally. The authors of the study published Thursday poked a hornet\u2019s nest by suggesting that many cancers are unavoidable. The provocative findings by Bert Vogelstein and Cristian Tomasetti at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, have stirred up a heated scientific debate that started two years ago, when they published a report along similar lines. Back then, critics said they were undercutting important messages about cancer prevention.",
        "The U. S. Senate has a lot going on: confirmation hearings for a Supreme Court nominee, negotiations on repealing the Affordable Care Act, votes on gun sales regulations and rules for Alaska. But a big telecom matter found its way into the schedule: privacy rules for Internet service providers. In a vote Thursday, senators approved a resolution to undo sweeping privacy rules adopted by the Federal Communications Commission. If it becomes law, it would also prevent the FCC from setting similar rules again.",
        "Almost three years ago, the ferry Sewol sank in rough seas off South Korea. More than 300 people perished, mostly high school students on a field trip. Now, South Korea\u2019s government is trying to raise what\u2019s left of the ship. As NPR\u2019s Elise Hu reports from Seoul, nine of the people who were aboard that day in April 2014 remain missing, and families hope to recover those bodies once the Sewol has been lifted out of the water and put in dry dock.

But President Trump\u2019s proposed budget has this program, like many others, facing cuts. On a hazy morning, Alan Zebker and and Vicki Kysella are organizing packages of food in the back of Zebker\u2019s SUV. They\u2019re volunteers with Meals on Wheels West in Santa Monica. They\u2019ve got their routine down. \u201dAlan packs the bags I make the deliveries,\u201d Kysella says. \u201dWhen she\u2019s delivering, I pack more bags,\u201d Zebker says. Every client gets a hot meal along with a couple of lighter meals or snacks.",
        "Advocates for the poor say the budget plan the Trump administration rolled out on Thursday would be a kick in the shins for Americans. Sheryl Braxton, who relies on public housing, explained at a hearing in New York City this week that her community needs reinvestment, not less funding. \u201dWe have more mold issues, garbage issues, a water issue with lead, and it\u2019s really bad,\u201d she said.",
        "The Affordable Care Act replacement plan championed by President Trump would hurt people in rural areas that voted heavily for the Republican last fall, according to an NPR analysis of data on proposed subsidy changes from the Kaiser Family Foundation. The new changes in tax credits and subsidies for older Americans are a big reason many Republicans are hesitant to get behind the American Health Care Act, which is set for a vote in the House on Thursday. A major component of the Affordable Care Act, subsidies helped and people offset the cost of the health care premiums.",
        "It was a meeting of nerds and sharks. The \u201dbiotech nerds\u201d and \u201drobotic nerds\u201d were seven high school students from Washington, D. C. The eight teens who call themselves \u201dsharks\u201d and flew in from Ghana. \u201dThe shark is a big fish so it means you\u2019re big.

        "There\u2019s no denying it: Los Angeles isn\u2019t exactly gentle on the ears. That\u2019s one lesson, at least, from a comprehensive noise map created by the U. S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics. On the interactive U. S. map the agency released this week, which depicts data on noise produced primarily by airports and interstate highways, few spots glare with such deep and angry color as the City of Angels. Blame the area\u2019s handful of major airports and its legendary snarls of traffic \u2014 ranked this year as the worst in the nation.",
        "In 1921, an ad in The Seattle Times touted a brand new candy called \u201dAplets,\u201d a new confection made \u201dfrom the finest Washington apples and honey and walnuts.\u201d A few years later, Aplets were joined by \u201dCotlets,\u201d a similar candy made from an apricot base. In most of the world, \u201dAplets Cotlets\u201d were based on a treat called lokum, a word derived from Arabic, but the British and Americans know it as \u201dTurkish delight.\u201d The origins of Turkish delight are a bit mysterious.",

So, what do you do? Back in the old days, you would have braved the elements \u2014 or learned to plan ahead. But those days are coming to an end, at least in Washington, D. C.",
        "This is the story of a hoax that almost was. Its motivating force was a hunger for fame, or infamy, or whispered legend in a particularly American sort of way. It begins on a beach somewhere in south Florida. Earlier this year, a test pressing (literally a test, for labels and artists to hear before ordering a full run of new record) of an unknown musician\u2019s record was put up for sale on Discogs, a resale website popular with collectors.",
        "Kendrick Lamar, deservedly hailed as the god MC of his generation, made a peculiar pronouncement from on high (i. e. Internet) today that has fans genuflecting in collective anticipation. The rapper\u2019s Instagram account was wiped clean Thursday morning, replaced with one cryptic post added around sunrise. The simple image of the Roman numeral \u201dIV,\u201d with no caption provided, has led to a interpretation: Prepare ye the way for the impending release of Lamar\u2019s fourth studio album. Of course, it\u2019s a move meant to provoke wild conjecture."
