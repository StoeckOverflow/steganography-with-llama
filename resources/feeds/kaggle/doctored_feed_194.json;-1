        "Late on a weekday afternoon at Nashville \u2019 s 3rd and Lindsley Bar and Grill, Emoni Wilkins, Jason Eskridge and Scott Hicks are trying to tack a sense of rehearsing onto their sound engineers for the night \u2019 s show. They \u2019 re each supposed to perform a solo track, before wrapping up with a collective finale. With guidance from Eskridge, who \u2019 s strumming an acoustic piano, they ease into sympathetic silence on the chorus of James Dean \u2019 s \u201d Shower the People. \u201d Eskridge encourages Hicks to vamp, and she responds with fluttery, deep vocal runs.",
        "Even as they bore their wounds from a failed Affordable Care Act repeal bill, Republican leaders in Pennsylvania are looking ahead to the political battle \u2014 over taxes. \u201d I dare say that we will probably start going very, very strongly for the upcoming tax cuts and immigration reform, \u201d President Trump told reporters quietly. \u201d That will be next. \u201d Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan agreed, though he denied that the defeat on health bills was a setback. \u201d This does make tax reform more difficult, \u201d Ryan stated.",
        "Vice Chairman Mike Pence traveled to West Virginia Saturday where he dealt with small business owners before delivering public speech, which included some lines about repealing President Obama \u2019 s health care law, a day after government efforts to gut the Affordable Care Act went down in flames. \u201d West Virginia and President Trump, we all know the truth about this failed law, that every day Obamacare survives is another day that America dies, \u201d Pence told a crowd gathered at a Charleston construction services company.",
        "Some basketball matches on Friday night were devoted to television commercials that were incapable of peddling some alternative facts. That \u2019 s because in some cities with districts, commercials involved praising some Republican Congress members for their efforts in repealing the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare. The problem of course is that repeal effort, which many feared would be a slam dunk, was made because the House Republicans didn \u2019 t have enough support from within their own caucus.",
        "Washington, D. C. \u2019 s Capital City Public Charter School looked like a mini United Nations. Many of the program \u2019 s 981 students are Americans with ancestry spanning the globe, from El Salvador to Nigeria to Afghanistan. So when the staff of the literacy 826DC developed a project with the junior staff, they picked a topic everyone could relate to that also left room for creative expression : food. Writing coaches asked us to think of a family recipe with a backstory \u2014 and then write an essay around that dish.",
        "The House Budget Committee \u2019 s investigation into the Obama campaign \u2019 s potential relation to Russia \u2019 s election meddling isn \u2019 t helping \u2014 but it \u2019 s not exactly dancing a jig, either. Lawmakers are looking ahead to a coming week with nothing on their fiscal calendar following a motion by the Republican chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, to cancel an extraordinary hearing that had been scheduled for September with former national Republican leaders from the Obama Administration. Democrats, led by Nunes \u2019 former Californian Rep.",
        "Political affairs are a dangerous business, particularly this year. But it does look as though one way or another, the U. S. Senate will decide to confirm the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U. S. Supreme Court. The open question is how much damage Republicans will do to their own long game in the Senate. The long game is this : Judge Gorsuch will not change the overall performance on the Supreme Court. But two of the current sitting justices are over 80, and a third is nearly 79.",
        "Editor \u2019 s Choice : This story includes descriptions and descriptions of violent incidents between police and civilians, as well as language that may not be helpful for all readers. For three hours last summer, none of us watched as newspapers and computer screens reported violence between police and civilians. Alton Sterling and Philando Castile were ambushed and killed by police. Then a gunman shot five police cruisers in Dallas. That week makes clear just how much these tales of police violence have become part of our lives.",
        "Valerie Wilson started performing in the underground club scene when she was still a teenager. She \u2019 s a New Orleans now, with a vocal style that incorporates traditional blues, rock and soul and pushes them into every realm. On her new release, The Order of Time, she brought other voices to that world with her : Her brothers, Jason and Patrick Hockett, contribute background vocals, as does her single father, who was a gospel and rock promoter involved with two of Prince \u2019 s first singles in the 1980s. June says that it \u2019 s clear from the first time her group \u2019 s sung together.",
        "If you \u2019 re a fan of The Wire, you probably have strong thoughts about Alison Wright \u2019 s character, Martha. Poor, helpless, trusting Martha had to be smuggled out of the U. S. because she married a man who was no good for her \u2014 a man who turned out to be a CIA spy. Wright became a sensation with her performance on The Simpsons. She \u2019 s also in FX \u2019 s Feud, about the rivalry between actresses Joan Rivers and Bette Davis, and she \u2019 s making her acting debut in Lynn Nottage \u2019 s Ghosts, about the deindustrialization of a town.",
        "It \u2019 s hardly normal for athletes, both amateur and professional, to have pregame rituals. But the NBA \u2019 s deep commitment to one dish goes deep : NBA Magazine calls the PBJ sandwich the league \u2019 s \u201d secret food. \u201d \u201d In every NBA locker room, you \u2019 ll see a number of different foods on the floor, but PBJ \u2014 if there \u2019 s a locker room that doesn \u2019 t have it, I haven \u2019 t found it, \u201d ESPN reporter Bob Holmes tells Chris Simon.

        "The African Global Economic and Development Summit took place at the University of Southern California from March 16th to 18th. None of the approximately 60 invited guests from Africa were able to attend. The problem was that none of the African delegates were able to get U. S. visas.

        "No rest for the weary in our weekly roundup of national education news. Supreme Court rules on special education case, \u201dI\u2019m thrilled,\u201d said Amanda Morin, a parent and advocate with the website Understood. org, after the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in a case that could affect 6. 5 million special education students. \u201dNow I can actually go into a school system and say \u2019The Supreme Court has said, based on my child\u2019s abilities, he is legally entitled to make progress.\u2019 \u201d In Endrew F. v.",
        "Na Da Laing struggled in elementary school. \u201dI was different from other students,\u201d she remembers. \u201dI couldn\u2019t speak English at all.\u201d Now, eight years later, she\u2019s reading George Orwell\u2019s Animal Farm. In the U. S. roughly one in 10 students is an English language learner. Many schools struggle to help them feel comfortable with their new language.

        "This was to have been the week when President Trump turned his fledgling presidency around, setting a course for success and letting the wind fill its sails at last. Instead, it became his worst week to date, ending with the ship becalmed and its crew in disarray. After other controversies had spoiled the weather, the Republicans proved unable to muster the votes to pass their Obamacare bill in the House. The president and Speaker Paul Ryan had to call off the vote scheduled on the floor \u2014 not once but twice.",
        "Telehealth takes a lot of forms these days. Virtual visits with a health care provider can take place by video, phone or text, or via the Web or a mobile app. The one commonality: You get to consult a doctor from your home, the office, Starbucks or anywhere with a wifi or mobile connection. These appointments can be quick, and save you from having to schlep across town and sit in a waiting room, leafing through Time magazine articles, as prelude to every visit with a doc.",
        "For Jernica Qui\u00f1ones, the reality of sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS, hit close to home this year when a friend woke up on New Year\u2019s Day and discovered the lifeless body of her baby girl.

        "After yesterday\u2019s pulled health care vote, many on the left and the right are seeing it as a failure for Republicans \u2014 but former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay says it\u2019s actually a blessing in disguise.

        "These days just about every device is \u201dsmart.\u201d There are smart cars, phones, TVs, grills and speakers, and most people don\u2019t think twice about buying a new TV, hooking it up to the internet and giving it access to different apps.

Much of the issues surround the inability of the Latino players to meaningfully communicate with the press.",
        "Filmmaker Maysaloun Hamoud does not like being typecast. \u201dThe Israelis say, you don\u2019t look Arab or Palestinian,\u201d she says, rolling her eyes. \u201dHuh?

        "Looking at Claire Rosen\u2019s photographs can feel like walking into someone else\u2019s dreams. One of her images shows a young girl about to be dragged into the sky by a pack of flying toy horses. Another series shows horses, hedgehogs, cockatoos and camels posed before different sumptuous feasts, as if having their own last suppers. \u201dI have a very sort of whimsical, surreal, view of the world that is deeply rooted in magic and fairy tales,\u201d Rosen says.

        "Undergoing treatment for cancer is hard enough by itself. And for many cancer patients who spend most of their time in a hospital, it gets even harder with the loss of basic comforts. The hospital\u2019s sterile environment, the fluorescent lights and the disposable gowns do little to make medical treatment more bearable. Nikla Lancksweert, wanted to do a little something to help with that dehumanizing experience, focusing on an alternative for those uncomfortable hospital gowns.
