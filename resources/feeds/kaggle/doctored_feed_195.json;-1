        "Updated at 8 : 15 p. m. ET, The head of the Senate Intelligence Committee suddenly went to the White House grounds to meet with a friend, before he surprised his colleagues by briefing the staff \u2014 and the press \u2014 on information they hadn \u2019 t discovered. The revelation, first denied by CNN and later announced by a spokesman for the chairman, Sen. Devin Nunes, is the latest milestone in the strange saga of Nunes \u2019 unorthodox actions last week. J. Adam Schiff,.",
        "President Trump is doing his best to put a straight face on defeat in his administration \u2019 s attempt to replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. His strategy is simple : say that the law is failing. And he is writing that message in his own distinctly Trumpian fashion : concocting it out of simple, bold phrases and then hammering that message home, over and over : Obamacare, in his eyes, will \u201d explode. \u201d \u201d The best thing we can do, politically speaking, is help Obamacare explode, \u201d he said in the Oval Office on Friday after the GOP child care bill goes down.",
        "President Bush was downright low energy. The smile on his face, as he meandered through unscripted remarks made after the defeat of the Republican child care plan he advocated, told the story. The effort subdued Trump called the loss a \u201d learning lesson. \u201d Then he seemed to shrug it all off and decided he was moving on. But it \u2019 s hardly possible to be that simple or easy. The same fissures in the GOP that derailed the health care bill will be there when it came to any big issue pushing forward, whether it \u2019 s welfare reform, infrastructure or even the government.",
        "Venezuela \u2019 s extremely unpopular government is taking more than 100 political prisoners \u2014 and some political experts are including an alien among them. Utah Governor Joshua Holt returned to Venezuela last fall to marry his Venezuelan fianc\u00e9e. But in a shocking twist, he \u2019 s ended up breaking bars on weapons purchases. An Eagle Scout and a Christian missionary, Holt, 24, meets Thamara Candelo through a religious website. After a whirlwind online romance, Holt and Candelo, a married Mormon, agreed to get married in her home village.",
        "The number was nothing less than a shock to the authorities. In text set atop a series of photographs, each one depicting a girl of six staring back at the screen, the image that went viral on social media every week claims to lay bare an appalling truth : \u201d 14 Girls Have Gone Missing in Manhattan in the Last 24 Hours. \u201d truth is, police say the rumor is not true. On Friday, the city \u2019 s Metropolitan Police department told NBC \u2019 s Philadelphia affiliate that at no point in several weeks have 14 girls disappeared from the city in a single case.",

        "The Associated Press has tallied up business lost in North Carolina because of the controversial \u201d water bill, \u201d and estimates the estimated cost is at least $ 3. 76 billion over 12 years. That estimate is relatively low, the wire company says. The law in Georgia, HB2, was passed just over a year ago. It blocks local politicians from passing protections for gay and bisexual people, and requires young people in government positions to use bathrooms that match the one on their birth certificate. The bill has prompted a backlash from businesses and nonprofit organizations, from Paypal to the NCAA.",
        "Primate brains might have grown larger and more functional thanks to a diet, a recent study suggests. The study analyzed the brain regions and diets of over 140 primate species spanning apes, elephants, lemurs and lorises and found that those who munched on fruit instead of leaves had 25 percent more brain tissue, even when measuring for body size and food relatedness. Take spider monkeys and howler monkeys, for example. They both reside in the rain forests of Central America in groups of about 10.",
        "On the fringes of Beijing, surrounded by affluent housing areas and the headquarters of some of China \u2019 s biggest firms, there \u2019 s a slum folks named Didi Village. Cars with different license plates are stored under makeshift shelters inside crowded, ramshackle dwellings. Many of the village \u2019 s inhabitants are migrant workers who, until recently, worked for Didi Chuxing, China \u2019 s largest conglomerate. One of them, Wang Fei, quit driving last month. Back then, he recalls, Didi and its main competitor, Uber, were locked in a civil war.",
        "More than 650, 000 prisoners are killed every year in the U. S. but no federal agency monitors the unemployment rate for this year. Experts say low educational and technological literacy, as well as reluctance among states to hire former convicts, means many drop out of the prison force altogether. High employment levels for that year cost between $ 57 billion and $ 65 billion annually in lost labor activity, according to a 2010 report by the Center for Economic and Social Research.",

        "One of Germany \u2019 s largest banks allegedly sent more than $ 5 billion to other banks, according to German media. It \u2019 s not the first stumble for investment bank KfW, which famously transferred hundreds of millions of dollars to Lehman Brothers on the same day the U. S. bank filed for bankruptcy. The most recent error took place in February and was flagged by Berlin \u2019 s central Bundesbank, according to German newspaper Handelsblatt. In an emailed statement, KfW \u2014 full name : Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau \u2014 told German media that it needed the money that it had transferred by hand.",

ET, President Trump \u2019 s and adviser Jared Kushner is invited to talk to the Senate Budget Committee about his meetings with Russian officials, Senate officials tell NPR. The committee is looking into Russia \u2019 s ability to meddle in last year \u2019 s presidential election, as well as potential ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.

        "In Lewiston, Maine, more people than ever are showing up at the Franco Center for La Rencontre, a monthly luncheon that encourages French conversation. Of the 200 people who come to break bread together, most are Lewiston natives who are older and white. But these days, you\u2019ll also find black immigrants from Africa gathered around the luncheon tables. They\u2019re French speakers who want to improve their English and get to know their neighbors. That interest has also spurred creation of local French clubs that meet several times a week.",
        "colleges have faced federal and state investigations in recent years for their aggressive recruiting tactics \u2014 accusations that come as no surprise to author Tressie McMillan Cottom. Cottom worked as an enrollment officer at two different colleges, but quit because she felt uncomfortable selling students an education they couldn\u2019t afford. Her new book, Lower Ed, argues that colleges exploit racial, gender and economic inequality. Cottom tells Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross that institutions tend to focus their recruiting on students who qualify for the maximum amount of student aid. \u201dThat happens to be the poorest among us,\u201d she says.",

        "President Trump continues to own hundreds of businesses around the world, and he has staffed his administration with wealthy people who have ties to a complex web of companies. Those financial entanglements have prompted government ethics experts to raise concerns about conflicts of interest. They are worried that this president is violating the U. S. Constitution\u2019s Emoluments Clause, which bars elected officials from benefiting from foreign governments. Also, in various legal filings and lawsuits, they have raised questions about whether the financial interests of the president and his appointees may be influencing public policy.",

        "What\u2019s it like to sue President Trump? For Jeffrey Lovitky, with a firm in Washington, D. C. it\u2019s not a great feeling. \u201dIt is intimidating. I am intimidated,\u201d he said in an interview with NPR. \u201dI mean, I would rather not be doing this.\u201d But he has done it, and when he couldn\u2019t enlist anyone else to be the plaintiff, he took on that role, too. \u201dI think people are afraid to put their name out there on a lawsuit against the president,\u201d he said.",
        "President Trump\u2019s continued business dealings have generated plenty of about whether the occupant of the White House will be profiting off his new role.

        "Editor\u2019s Note: This story has been edited throughout. An earlier version was inadvertently published. Hossein Mahrammi, who helped U. S. development authorities in Kabul rebuild his country, expected a warm welcome when he arrived in the United States this month. The economist had planned to stay in Afghanistan but left because he feared for himself and his family.

But when he landed with his wife and four young sons at Dulles International Airport in Virginia, they were detained.",
        "Overcoats\u2019 music has been undeniable for me from the first time I saw the duo perform. The deep friendship between Hana Elion and JJ Mitchell comes across in their vibrant harmonies and the bountiful dance parties that pop up as they go. Behind those rich voices lies a spare electronic backdrop that feels spacious and refreshing. Not long ago, these songs would likely be backed by a guitar, but their healthy energy feels more urgent with an underpinning drone and Joao Gonzalez\u2019s drumming at the Tiny Desk.",

I\u2019m yanked from sleep by the little one calling from her room. \u201dMommy! Is it time to wake up yet? Can I get up now? Pleeeeeeaaaase?\u201d The answer is \u201dno,\u201d but I get up anyway. 7:00 a. m. The little one wants oatmeal. The big one wants cereal. I just want coffee.

        "The House of Representatives has gone along with the Senate and voted to overturn a regulation that would have required Internet service providers \u2014 like Comcast, Verizon and Charter \u2014 to get consumers\u2019 permission before selling their data. President Trump is expected to sign the rollback, according to a White House statement. The measure is a victory for the ISPs, which have argued that the regulation would put them at a disadvantage compared with edge providers, like Google and Facebook. Those companies are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and face less stringent requirements.",
        "President Trump is expected to sign into law a decision by Congress to overturn new privacy rules for Internet service providers. Passed by the Federal Communications Commission in October, the rules never went into effect. If they had, it would have given consumers more control over how ISPs use the data they collect. Most notably, the rules would have required explicit consent from consumers if sensitive data \u2014 like financial or health information, or browsing history \u2014 were to be shared or sold.",

Some families are even canceling their food stamps and other government benefits, for fear that receiving them will affect their immigration status or lead to deportation.

        "The Constitution and the Supreme Court both say a president is largely immune from civil lawsuits. The chief executive does critical work leading the nation, the logic goes, and shouldn\u2019t be bedeviled by ordinary civil lawsuits. That\u2019s the argument that President Bill Clinton used almost exactly 20 years ago, when he tried but failed to stop the sexual harassment suit brought by Paula Jones. Now it\u2019s being made by lawyers for President Trump, against a sexual harassment suit brought by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Trump\u2019s TV show The Apprentice."
