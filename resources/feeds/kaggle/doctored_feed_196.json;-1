        "Russians are also trying to understand precisely what happened over the weekend, when dozens of people \u2014 many of them teenagers \u2014 turned out for rallies in dozens of cities across the globe. Sunday \u2019 s rallies were the biggest public demonstration of discontent with the Kremlin since a wave of protests three winters ago that aimed to stop the of Vladimir Putin for an unprecedented third time as president.

        "In 2008, candidate Barack Obama ran an advertisement with this opening line : \u201d The people that built this nation can start a new economy. The hands that harvest crops can still harvest the wind. \u201d And then it described men working on agriculture : \u201d The hands that install fences can also install solar panels. \u201d The ad was directed at a group Obama was acutely aware he had to win over \u2014 white, man.

        "President Trump signed a sweeping executive order Tuesday that would aim at a number of his government \u2019 s climate policies. The decree seeks to undo the centerpiece of former President Obama \u2019 s environmental programs and national efforts to combat climate change. It would also jeopardize America \u2019 s pivotal role in international action to confront climate change.

        "President Trump faced a whopping defeat on Twitter, when Republicans pulled their pledge to repeal and replace Obamacare as it was leading to certain failure. But this isn \u2019 t the first time Trump has faced defeat. Nor it is the first time a president has faced defeat on the very issue of health insurance. In 1991, the Trump Taj Mahal casino in Oklahoma City was deeply in debt and so was Donald Trump. It was the second of his four business bankruptcies.",

        "Why don \u2019 t the police take warning shots? That \u2019 s a story that comes up a lot, especially after controversial shooting deaths. Last fall, the National Association of Chiefs of Police and 10 other law enforcement officers got together to work out a consensus policy on the use of force \u2014 a sort of consultation document for local groups that want to update their information. When the document came out in October, it contained a surprise : It asked for warning shots. For police trainers and use of gun experts around the nation, that news is still sinking in.",

        "Of all the men who have been U. S. president, just one is killed on the grounds of a state capitol. But that could be about to change. Lawmakers in Tennessee have taken the first step to exhume the bodies of James K. Polk, who for a century has rested in a big, white, tomb with his daughter, Sarah.

More recently, the art form has been adapted to modern media: In the 1920s and \u201930s, operas were written to be performed on the radio, and in 1951, NBC commissioned Gian Carlo Menotti to compose Amahl And The Night Visitors for television.

        "America has some noisy neighborhoods \u2014 and Los Angeles is number one. That\u2019s what you can learn from a new noise map from the U. S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics. I sympathize with the beleaguered ears of Los Angelenos \u2014 up to a point. That\u2019s because I live in India.

        "There\u2019s no one way to define a great voice: Genius might lie in the phrasing, the range, the power, the control, the words themselves, or some sort of indescribable something else. But one way to diagnose genius for sure is to have a singer walk into a crowded room with little to no accompaniment, open his or her mouth, and command breathless attention in a matter of seconds. A U. K. pop singer, Adele rocketed to fame a few years ago, alongside a handful of other soulful throwbacks.",

        "Celiac disease, the autoimmune disorder that prevents people from digesting gluten, affects about 1 percent of the population. But there\u2019s not enough evidence to recommend screening everybody to find that 1 percent, an advisory panel said Tuesday. In people with celiac disease, eating foods with gluten inflames the lining of the intestine and makes it difficult to absorb nutrients. People who are diagnosed with the condition are told to cut gluten out of their diets entirely, which can be difficult and expensive, even as products have become more widely available.",

There\u2019s no freedom in freedom.\u201d He meant that when an artist chooses to work within the structure of something like a sonata or a play, their creativity can actually be heightened. Constraints, ironically, can lead to freedom. And what\u2019s true of music and theater is equally true of fiction, as we are seeing in the second season of SyFy\u2019s epic series The Expanse. Last year, I wrote two pieces on Season 1 of the Expanse."
