        "Code Switch \u2019 s Joe Florido has been covering the new deportation movement for us. For this book, he spoke to key speakers to understand why hundreds of states are ready to start a major fight with the current government to prevent deportations of immigrants living in the U.

        "What follows is an allegory in which blogger Marcelo Gleiser imagines a discussion between a geneticist, a Buddhist, a physicist, a scientist, and a theologian about life and the origins of humanity. At an undisclosed place, a geneticist, a Buddhist, a physicist, a chemist, and a theologian sat waiting for dinner. The idea was to live in the almost lost thread of conversation, where a group of intellectuals exchange opinions with an independent mind, eager to push forward their views but struggling with the shared goal of understanding from one another. Cell phones were turned off.",

A \u2019 s Get Straight Outta Compton and the first episode of NPR \u2019 s All Things Considered have in common? That little riddle just seemed a little easier to understand on Wednesday : The Library of Congress announced that all three \u201d aural recordings \u201d \u2014 along with roughly two dozen other recordings \u2014 have been placed into its National Recording Registry. \u201d These recordings of the past enrich our understanding of the nation \u2019 s cultural history and our cultures in general, \u201d Librarian of Congress Jim Hayden said in a rush.",

        "It has been more than eight centuries since the last living Tasmanian tiger disappeared. In that time, the marsupial has become the object of textbook sketches and yellowing pages, little more than a memory thrown into oblivion. But Thylacinus cynocephalus may still be out there. Two \u201d plausible sightings \u201d have challenged the accepted wisdom that the animal has gone extinct \u2014 and have inspired researchers at Australia \u2019 s James Cook University to commence a project to find it themselves. Let \u2019 s clarify one thing right away : this animal is no feline.",

Our southern neighbor is the United States\u2019 leading supplier of fresh produce, providing 70 percent of the fresh vegetables we import and more than 40 percent of our fresh fruit imports.
