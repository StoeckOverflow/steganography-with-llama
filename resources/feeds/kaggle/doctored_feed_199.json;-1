        "Take a quick breath in through your nose, and slowly let it out through your mouth. Do you sound calmer? Controlled breathing like this can trigger anxiety, panic attacks and depression. It \u2019 s one thing so many people prefer tranquility after meditation or a pranayama yoga lesson. How exactly the brain links slow breathing with calmness and stop breathing with nervousness, though, has been a challenge. Now, researchers say they \u2019 ve severed the link, at least in mind.",
        "Note : Billboard \u2019 s First Listen section comes down after the album is done. However, you can still start with the Spotify or Apple Music playlist at the bottom of the page. Alex Luciano is a human tornado on a Pixy Stix bender. As the frontman, guitarist and one member of the undeniably charming duo Le Cig, Luciano is known to bop, flail and touch the stage. And that boundless exuberance is infectious, coaxing people into sock hops.",
        "Note : Apple \u2019 s First Listen list comes down after the album is recorded. However, you can still play with the Spotify or Apple Music playlist at the back of the page. When Taylor Hawkins and his bandmates in Timber Timbre set out for France a week ago to record their debut record, Sincerely, Future Pollution, they found a sound you could dance to, that was worthy of celebration.",
        "Updated at 2 : 55 p. m. ET, Airline passengers coming to the U. S. and Britain on international flights from a number of nations must now place most mobile devices, including laptops, monitors and cameras, in checked boxes under security measures, the US administration and the British press said.

        "They say too many cooks can spoil the broth. But in cities like San Francisco and Boston, many are facing a shortage of cooking staff, caused especially by low pay. The crisis can be traced to the wage gaps between tipped and nontipped employees. In an effort to bridge that gap and improve kitchen workers, some restaurants are now trying an experiment : resource sharing. You can see that experiments play out at Mamaleh \u2019 s Delicatessen, a Jewish deli in Boston, Mass.",
        "New Jersey Mayor Bill de Blasio plans to close the state \u2019 s notorious Rikers Island jail. But even he acknowledges that the process will not be simple or easy. \u201d It will take many years, \u201d de Blasio said at a news conference hosted at City Hall. \u201d It will take many tough changes along the way. But it will pass. \u201d There are currently about 10, 000 inmates at the Rikers Island jail complex, most of them waiting for trial.

        "Sure, the team from the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service arrived just a month late for Manatee Appreciation Day \u2014 but it \u2019 s assumed the gentle finned blimp will be too upset about the belated event : The announcement that the agency is excluding the West Indian manatee from the list of endangered species is unnecessary, no matter when it arrives. In some respects, this moment marks even less than a \u201d success story \u201d for the giant marine mammal, which roams from the western U. S. into the Caribbean. That \u2019 s what Mark Kloer, spokesman for the agency, told Reuters.",
        "Since 2010, the primary avatar on Twitter has been an egg. The theme apparently was that a new baby was like a gestating bird, waiting to make its first tweet. It was meant to be playful and cute. But over time, Twitter \u2019 s eggs evolved to symbolize something different : birds who remain shadowy on Twitter, to harass their fellow tweeters. Today, Facebook announced that it was doing away with the eggs as its default avatar, opting instead for a nondescript look. No more bright colors, please \u2014 the new avatar is all gray.",

        "A former Sheriff \u2019 s aide convicted of killing more than three dozen deaths died on Thursday, several days after he was attacked and shot in his Ohio prison facility. As Ohio Public University \u2019 s Karen Kasler reports, \u201d John Harvey had been nicknamed the \u2019 House of Death \u2019 in 1987, after admitting to killing 37 elderly or chronically ill men in hospitals in Cincinnati and southern Kentucky beginning in 1970.

        "Don\u2019t be tricked by their appearance \u2014 fangblenny fish aren\u2019t just a cute face. They use special venom to avoid being eaten. The fish are 2 inches long and live in places such as Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef. When one is caught and swallowed up by a predator, the blenny literally bites its way out. The venom disorients the bigger fish, and the blenny escapes to freedom. Bryan Fry, an associate professor at the University of Queensland in Australia, leads a group of researchers that has learned more about how venomous fangblennies do their thing.",
        "A little seminar in documentary technique is being offered by two docs about women this week. The filmmakers for All This Panic take a approach with their teenage subjects \u2014 no narration, no explainers. The directors of God Knows Where I Am tease out their story as if it were a mystery novel. Both approaches prove effective, albeit for reasons that have everything to do with their respective subject matter. The makers of All This Panic must\u2019ve been just to keep up with teenage sisters Dusty and Ginger and their pals as they careen around their Brooklyn neighborhood.",
        "President Trump escalated a Twitter war with lawmakers in his own party on Thursday evening, calling out three members of the Freedom Caucus by name. \u201dIf @RepMarkMeadows, @Jim_Jordan and @Raul_Labrador would get on board we would have both great healthcare and massive tax cuts reform,\u201d he tweeted. The attack follows an earlier missive aimed at both the Freedom Caucus and Democrats. It\u2019s a curious tactic, given that Trump\u2019s only two options to pass his agenda through Congress are to either unite the fractured GOP or to form new alliances across the aisle.",
        "When people find out that Malebogo Malefhe uses a wheelchair because she was shot by her boyfriend, the first question they ask is: \u201dWhat did you do to him?\u201d Now Malefhe, who sustained eight bullets from her boyfriend of 10 years, wants to make sure that no woman who has faced domestic abuse is asked this question ever again.

        "There\u2019s a compelling question at the heart of a report released this week by the Metropolitan Planning Council: If more people \u2014 especially educated professional white Americans \u2014 knew exactly how they are harmed by the country\u2019s pervasive racial segregation, would they be moved to try to decrease it? Researchers from the MPC, a nonprofit, and from the Urban Institute tried to create a workable formula for estimating the cost, collectively and individually, of the persistent problem in their report, \u201dThe Cost of Segregation: Lost income. Lost lives. Lost potential.",

        "Ernie Col\u00f3n does a lot for a business suit. Two types of people populate The Torture Report, a new graphical adaptation of the 2014 Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report on the use of enhanced interrogation techniques under George W. Bush. There are the detainees \u2014 usually nearly nude in frigid temperatures, their bodies wracked with agony \u2014 and there are the bureaucrats at whose mercy they suffer. These men are inevitably clad in that uniform of conservatism and civilization, the business suit. There\u2019s even a besuited silhouette on the cover, hands shoved in his pockets, radiating placid certainty.",

Last night, Broken Social Scene played \u201dHalfway Home\u201d on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert with no less than 13 musicians onstage. Kevin Drew was out front with Metric\u2019s Emily Haines and James Shaw, and Stars\u2019 Amy Millan and Evan Cranely.

        "Actor and singer Jack Black interrupted a performance with his band Tenacious D to break into an a cappella version of Prince\u2019s \u201dWhen Doves Cry.\u201d The moment came while the band was playing the song \u201dDouble Team\u201d during the German music festival Rock Am Ring. Black and Tenacious D have always been a novelty act, playing ironic, overtly sexual and comically exaggerated heavy metal songs (on acoustic guitar). But the actor and his musical partner Kyle Gass are undeniably talented musicians who know what they\u2019re doing, even if it\u2019s all mostly a joke.",

Trump is dealing with and infighting that threatens to derail his agenda, as well as nagging Russia investigations on Capitol Hill that are raising more questions than answers about his team. And Trump has a real perception problem with the American public \u2014 he has the lowest approval rating at this point of any president in more than half a century.

        "In the hands of Japanese netsuke carvers like Ryushi Komada, something quite mundane becomes sublime. From a simple block of wood emerges a delicate and expressive face, the sense of movement in the folds of a dress, the fine strings on an ancient instrument. A carver, Komada is a master creator of these pieces that are the perfect embodiment of \u201dnecessity is the mother of invention\u201d \u2014 and, in this instance, artistry.

They are hoping that a new, provocative campaign that includes a good dose of shock and shame will change men\u2019s behavior toward female transit customers. Activists outfitted a subway car with nude male torso on a single seat back and prominent genitalia where riders would sit.
