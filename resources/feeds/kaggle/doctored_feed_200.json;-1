        "Before Friday morning \u2019 s national semifinal bout, the Mississippi State men \u2019 s basketball coach made an unusual motivational speech. \u201d I will not be scared, \u201d Vic Schaefer told his coaches. \u201d There is no reason to be scared. You are one heck of a basketball player. \u201d The tactic makes more sense in light of the opponent : University of Connecticut, riding a win streak that included a thrashing of Ohio State in last night \u2019 s Sweet 16. At the time, it was the biggest defeat in tournament history. On Friday night, Florida wiped all that away, based on Morgan William \u2019 s bench.",
        "Welcome to another weekly roundup from the NPR Advisory Team, where we lasso the latest updates on student aid, college choice, and more. Trump University settlement finalized, hundreds of students are set to pay money back now that U. S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel has ordered the $ 25 million fraud charges against Trump University. The nonaccredited format of seminars, which shut down in 2010, was planned as a way to share Donald Trump \u2019 s expertise in real estate. Several critics argued that the focus instead was on participants \u2019 wallets.",
        "While preparing for my return from World Cafe as well, I \u2019 ve been looking back on the final 25 years of the show. Flip back through the calendar pages with Talia Schlanger and me as we find some of the greatest albums I \u2019 ve heard since the show \u2019 s debut, going all the way back to Richard Thompson \u2019 s Rumor And Sigh from 1991. Sometimes I Sit And Think, And Sometimes I Just Sit ( 2015 ) We fell in love with Melbourne, Australia \u2019 s Anna Barnett thanks to her 2015 book Sometimes I Sit And Think, And Sometimes I Just Sit.",
        "Amgad Naguib is a collector of ephemera \u2014 the fleeting, unexpected and often overlooked things of everyday life. The old matchbooks, toothbrushes and ticket stubs \u2014 a few of the objects among hundreds of thousands in his library \u2014 normally spill from boxes and boxes in his overstuffed Cairo office.",
        "It \u2019 s creeping towards 9 in the evening, but a group of old people is still meeting at the National Front leadership \u2019 s office in Metz, in eastern France. They \u2019 re preparing for a race for their presidential candidate, Marine Le Pen. Arnaud du Rign\u00e9 remembers when he first got interested in the party. \u201d I was just 16 and I saw that there was a big problem in France with massive immigration and mass globalization with no economic borders, \u201d he continues. \u201d And there was insecurity and places in the city where police didn \u2019 t even want to live.",
        "Kendrick Lamar releases the presumptive first single \u2014 titled \u201d Humble \u201d \u2014 from his highly anticipated debut album on Thursday morning, just a week after teasing new music with a cryptic Instagram post. The lyrics, less exploration of contrition on the part of Lamar than an instruction to his listeners, picks up a thread NPR Music first revealed following that album teaser : how the \u201d black rapper alive \u201d might explore the theme of religion, religion and personal identity. ( In the previous single, \u201d The End Part 4, \u201d Lamar turns to a similar narrative : \u201d Tell \u2019 em that God comin \u2019.",
        "The nation says this week that Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, have had some unusually strict arrangements around their marriage. That \u2019 s something The Washington Post \u2019 s Peter Parker dug up in February a profile of Karen Pence this Friday. As Parker tweeted on Wednesday, \u201d Mike Pence never dines alone [ with ] a woman not his wife, nor does he attends parties [ with ] alcohol, her by his side. \u201d This habit, of avoiding alone time with another woman, is what some may call the \u201d Billy Joe Rule, \u201d after the famous evangelist.",
        "For runners of major races, spring is a strong season. As temperatures change, weekend racing ramps up \u2014 even for those training for this month \u2019 s Boston Marathon. It \u2019 s also crunch time for the sleuths sniffing out runners who cheat to get to that crown jewel of fame. Derek Murphy is one of these race detectives. He \u2019 s a weather analyst in suburban Maryland and recreational runner who pores over travel data to catch cheaters around the country. It \u2019 s been his pastime for about two months, and he pays special attention to the Boston Marathon.",
        "Since the incumbent health care minister died recently, Donald Trump has been looking to get blame for the early failures in his administration. Last year, he found an easy scapegoat \u2014 the conservative House Freedom Caucus, that had voiced reservations about the Affordable Care Act replacement bill from the outset. In a series of tweets, the president denied the specter of even backing presidential challengers against some of the caucus \u2019 s members, and instead began calling out the Senate \u2019 s leaders by name.",
        "\u201d Water was the real thing, \u201d says Dr Tim McDonnell of the volunteers at the refugee settlement of Palorinya in northeastern Uganda. Since December, 146, 000 South Sudanese have crossed the border, fleeing the violence of the recent war. And without fresh water to drink, they could quite literally sick. He \u2019 d see them line up each house with their jerrycans to get the 15 liters of water for safe use. That \u2019 s a little less than 4 gallons \u2014 the minimum for basic needs according to the World Health Organization.",
        "Imagine you \u2019 re a commanding officer in World War I. Armies have grown so large, you can no longer communicate just by the sound of your breath or the wave of your hand. You need to synchronize movements of troops and equipment, far and wide. You use a wristwatch. \u201d The entire process of sending artillery to protect trenches in the trenches, as they advanced, was an elaborately designed, choreographed forward action, \u201d said Carlene Stephens of the Army \u2019 s National Museum of American History, who \u2019 s showing me a 1917 wrist watch, the kind worn by many soldiers.

        "Kansas House Sen. Barbara Bollier is a Democrat who has been fighting for years to get her colleagues to agree to reform Medicaid. For years she pushed against what she sees as a \u201d Tea \u201d Senate and a government who wouldn \u2019 t consider the issue. In recognition for her efforts, she was stripped of her legislative assignments and sidelined. But in last month \u2019 s election, the makeup of the Kansas legislature moved decidedly to the left.",
        "This weekend patrols are ruling the road in Yellowstone National Park. Most park facilities are closed until later this month, but every spring Yellowstone loses about 50 miles of its main thoroughfares to tourists only. After riding about two miles into the park I pull over for a walk and leave my bike by the side of the road. Walking about 20 yards over to the edge of the river, I can see a herd of bison on the other side of the river. They \u2019 re in a brown meadow spiked with red and silver sagebrush.",
        "The town of Whiteclay, Neb. has a population of 14 people. Its four liquor stores sell 4 million cans of beer each year, mostly to residents of the Pine Ridge Reservation, which is officially dry and right across the state line. The effort to close the Whiteclay stores has spanned decades. But there\u2019s an assault on two fronts, including one from a minister who\u2019s looking to buy the stores. Pastor Bruce BonFleur is one of a dozen people who were appointed to the Whiteclay Task Force a year ago by Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts.",
        "Gilbert Baker, creator of the rainbow flag, which would endure as the symbol of gay activism and solidarity for 40 years, has died. Cleve Jones, a longtime friend and noted gay rights activist, announced the death on Twitter. Baker designed his first flag during the 1970s while an active member of San Francisco\u2019s gay community.

        "Humans have long looked to animals for design inspiration. From basic camouflage to a quiet bullet train in Japan to the Wright brothers\u2019 wings, the process called biomimicry is a basic tenet of human engineering. Jonathon Keats has turned it on its head. The artist and philosopher\u2019s latest exhibit, at the Samek Art Museum at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania, is a thought experiment on the selfish ways we humans innovate. The central question of the works: We steal the animal kingdom\u2019s evolutionary inventions, so why shouldn\u2019t the animal kingdom steal ours?",
        "New research published Monday adds fuel to an ongoing debate in the public health community over whether a few extra pounds are good, or bad, for you. Earlier research found that being somewhat overweight, but not obese, may result in a longer life. But today\u2019s study in the Annals of Internal Medicine suggests that being slightly overweight may actually decrease a person\u2019s life span, which is more in line with conventional wisdom about weight. So who\u2019s right? It\u2019s all about study design and statistical analysis.",
        "A federal appeals court has rejected a lawsuit against Mississippi over the use of the Confederate battle flag in the state flag. A black Mississippi resident said that the use of the Confederate symbol amounted to racial discrimination. But the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that any emotional harm caused by the flag is irrelevant, legally speaking, and doesn\u2019t give him grounds to sue. Mississippians have been debating their flag for a very long time. In 2001, the state voted to stick with the controversial design.",
        "When he testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee last week, former FBI agent Clint Watts described how Russians used armies of Twitter bots to spread fake news using accounts that seem to be Midwestern Republicans. \u201dSo that way whenever you\u2019re trying to socially engineer them and convince them that the information is true, it\u2019s much more simple because you see somebody and they look exactly like you, even down to the pictures,\u201d Watts told the panel, which is investigating Russia\u2019s role in interfering in the U. S. elections.",

        "\u201dI never thought farming would be my venture,\u201d says my sister, Faith. But perhaps it was her destiny. Our parents were farmers (and teachers as well) in a small farming community on the coast of Kenya, living in Mabafweni village in Kwale County. Their five children had to get up at 5 a. m. during growing season, roughly April to June, to weed grass from the fields and dig up the soil by hand to make it soft. Our parents took care of the big worries, like what to plant and how to manage the farm.",
        "Updated at 7:15 p. m. ET. Democratic senators have now publicly announced that they will vote against ending debate this week on the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U. S. Supreme Court. That means Republicans cannot at this time clear the threshold needed to proceed to an vote on the nomination. It also sets up an historic vote to end the Senate\u2019s filibuster rule for Supreme Court nominees. \u201dIf we have to, we will change the rules,\u201d Republican Sen.",
        "The U. S. Senate could make history this week, but no one is feeling particularly good about it. \u201dIt is depressing I\u2019m very depressed,\u201d said Sen. John McCain, . \u201dWe\u2019re all arguing against it, but we don\u2019t know any other option.\u201d The nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and the GOP blockade against Merrick Garland before him are forcing another showdown over whether to invoke the \u201dnuclear option\u201d and change the rules of the Senate to make it easier for a president to get all of his nominations approved.",

        "Let\u2019s get something straight up front: Spain and the U. K. are not going to war over Gibraltar.

        "Florida Gov. Rick Scott is removing Orlando\u2019s chief prosecutor from a number of murder cases in an ongoing dispute over the death penalty. Through executive order, the Republican governor is reassigning 22 murder cases from State Attorney Aramis Ayala to a prosecutor who handles a different judicial circuit. Ayala, a Democrat, is the first black elected prosecutor in Florida, and has said she will not seek the death penalty in Orange and Osceola counties, one of the largest judicial circuits in the state.",
        "The world is doing a much better job of keeping babies alive long enough to become children, children alive long enough to become teens and teens alive long enough to fully grow up, according to a report in today\u2019s JAMA Pediatrics. \u201dI think that the overall highlight of the report is good news,\u201d says Dr. Nicholas J. Kassebaum, an author of the report by members of the Global Burden of Disease Child and Adolescent Health Collaboration. \u201dWithout exception child mortality has improved throughout the world for the last 25 years.\u201d But it\u2019s not all good news.",
        "The NHL won\u2019t be pausing its season to allow players to participate in the 2018 Winter Olympics, officials announced on Monday. Many pro players have expressed a desire to compete in the Games at Pyeongchang, South Korea. But the league says it doesn\u2019t see a benefit to the sport \u2014 and does see a risk of injuries. The NHL has allowed players to participate in every Olympic Games since 1998. Perhaps unsurprisingly, disputes over money played a role in the decision not to continue.",
        "As President Trump moves to fulfill his campaign promise to deport millions of immigrants who are in the country illegally, they\u2019ll most likely include Mexicans whose children were born in the U. S.. Over half a million of these kids are already in Mexico. Researchers call them \u201dlos invisibles\u201d the invisible ones, because they often end up in an educational limbo of sorts. Most don\u2019t read or write in Spanish, so they\u2019re held back. Many get discouraged and stop going to school. In some cases schools even refuse to enroll them."
