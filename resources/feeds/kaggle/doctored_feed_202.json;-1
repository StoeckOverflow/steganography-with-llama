So on her new album, Mental Illness, she decided to lean into the stereotype. \u201d A friend of mine was asking me what the music was about, \u201d Mann says, \u201d And I thought, \u2019 Oh, you know, my original songs about mental disorders, \u2019 kind of being glib about it.

        "Researchers at Boston University this week performed a study that may bolster the theory that policies aimed at getting immigrants to come out of the states actually improve workplace safety. They found that a 2013 California law granting driver \u2019 s licenses to immigrants in the USA illegally reduced rates by 7 to 10 percent in 2015, meaning another 4, 000 fewer. In that same year, 600, 000 individuals got driver \u2019 s licenses under the law. It was the first year researchers had studied the outcomes of such driver \u2019 s license policies, which have generated significant results nationally.",

She tells Fresh FM \u2019 s Terry Gross that she felt like two \u201d tiny souls \u201d were warring inside of her, struggling for control. \u201d I thought that I was quite possibly schizophrenic, \u201d she says.

Even with all the progress we have made in medicine, millions of Americans suffer, or have family members who suffer, from diseases that are making their lives worse or destroy their lives.

But scientists are demonstrating that some forest dwellers also sing in ways humans usually can \u2019 t hear \u2014 via ultrasound. A lab from Dartmouth College has recorded these signals in treetops on a pristine Panamanian island named Barro Colorado, and slowed them down to make sense of them. The ultrasonic chatter, it turns out, is basically a complicated conversation between mating insects and the bats that wish to eat them.",

They are more likely than adults to die from chemical agents and to suffer injures. If they survive, they also suffer from the physical and mental trauma of the attack for far more years than adults simply because they have more years left to live.
