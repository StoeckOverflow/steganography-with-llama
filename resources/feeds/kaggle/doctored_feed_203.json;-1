        "One week in late February, the five members of Front Line were warming up for their record company show at the renowned bluegrass venue the Station Inn, in their former home base of Memphis, Tenn. They \u2019 d never played most of these gigs live before. It wasn \u2019 t a given that these concerts would wind up in anything remotely resembling a bluegrass era.

Baldwin told Fresh Air \u2019 s Dan Gross that his impression of the character is purposefully exaggerated. \u201d We \u2019 re doing it live on a network show at 11 : 30 at night in front of a live audience, so there \u2019 s a ton of volume to it, \u201d he says.",
        "In Kansas, a daily newspaper is being praised for its fine work in reporting that Pittsburg High School \u2019 s newly elected principal had seemingly overstated her performance. The principal, Amy Robertson, has now resigned, after the paper admitted she claimed advanced credentials from Corllins University, an entity whose legitimacy has been questioned. \u201d In light of the issues that arose, Mrs. Robertson felt it was in the good interest of the district to fill her position, \u201d the school administrator said Tuesday, stating that it will now begin looking for a new principal.

        "Gene and radio host Glen Weldon ( our American cousin from Pop Goes Happy Hour ) explore how comics are used as bases for mapping race and nation. Gene visits Amalgam Restaurant and Coffeehouse in Philadelphia and chats with proprietor Ariell Smith, who is reclaiming the comic book title, which once made her uneasy as a comic fan.

        "The idea that neuroscience is rediscovering the brain is, to most scientists and philosophers, nothing short of outrageous. Of course it is not. But the natural, adverse, attitude presupposes the presence of the soul \u2014 the ethereal, immaterial entity that completely encapsulates your essence. Surely, this conception of supernatural has no place in human science. And I agree. The Cartesian principle of body and soul, the res extensa ( spiritual stuff ) vs. res cogitans ( good stuff ) has long been regarded as untenable in a strictly materialistic description of bodily phenomena.",

        "In the annals of pop music history, the release of The Singles \u2019 Sgt. Pepper \u2019 s Lonely Hearts Club Band on June 1, 1967 operated as a fulcrum upon which the scales of rock \u2019 n \u2019 roll were tipped forevermore towards ambitious refraction, sonic metaphor and unashamed ignorance of the spaces in our minds. Its 50th anniversary, then, is something to be celebrated \u2014 and today, how it is. A voluminous and varied reissue run of that momentous album was announced accordingly.",
        "Driverless cars help transform the way our country moves, potentially making roads more efficient and thus saving lives because of potential traffic accidents. But for all the benefits of a driverless future, this transportation is essentially the livelihood of America \u2019 s professional citizens, including scores of workers of color. New research from the Center for Global Economic Solutions shows about 3 percent of all workers in the U. S. are in professional jobs. Truck, bus and tractor drivers are still the most common jobs in most industries.",
        "It doesn \u2019 t take more than a few minutes of the Discovery Channel \u2019 s Deadliest Species to get the idea that professional fishing can be a career long rife with risk, making it one of the most dangerous occupations in the U. S. Sometimes the danger stems from how fish are harvested. Risk for catching fish can vary by region and species. About a tenth of U.

But the federal government \u2019 s focus has national and local election officials, who are very protective of how they do things now, get nervous. They \u2019 re mainly worried that the federal government will tell them how to run their elections \u2014 right down to where polling sites should be located \u2014 in the name of security.",
        "Imagine if one notice from the federal government could cause you to question your major life decisions. More than half a million people may have found themselves in that situation after a new legal filing by the Education Department.

That\u2019s up from $20, 000 just 10 years ago, according to a new analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In that report, out this week, the New York Fed took a careful look at the relationship between debt and homeownership.

        "Updated at 3:15 p. m. ET on April 7, President Trump came into office promising big disruptive changes in the way America defined its role in the world. American foreign policy would no longer be aspirational \u2014 it would be transactional. \u201dWhat\u2019s in it for us?\u201d would guide the new \u201dAmerica First\u201d approach. Human rights? Downgraded. America as an idea, a beacon of freedom to tired, huddled masses? Been there, done that. Promoting democratic values as a way to strengthen America\u2019s own economic and national security? Nope. Trump just didn\u2019t see the connection.",

        "Texas Republican Mike Conaway will now preside over the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential election. This comes after the announcement on Thursday morning that the embattled Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, . will be stepping away from the Russia probe. Conaway is a congressman and the Republican on the committee. Said to be among his GOP colleagues, Conaway will have the difficult task of rebuilding trust and restoring credibility to a House probe that has, at times, resembled more of a soap opera than a collaborative bipartisan investigation.",
        "There\u2019s a school of thought in politics that says there are key strategists who are puppet masters, pulling the strings of a president or politician. Understand them and their influence, and you understand the person in power. Some of us don\u2019t subscribe 100 percent to that notion \u2014 and it\u2019s especially true when it comes to Donald Trump. Now, there is plenty of drama in the Trump White House, maybe more than any White House in recent memory. Everyone is trying to figure out just who is in Trump\u2019s ear, whom he is relying on most.",

        "A quiet change to the website photo banner of a relatively obscure federal agency is causing a bit of an outsize stir on social media.

        "The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee says he has seen \u201dno evidence\u201d that former national security adviser Susan Rice may have improperly surveilled Donald Trump or his aides during the transition. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia told NPR\u2019s Mary Louise Kelly on Thursday that he and his committee would pursue the evidence in their investigation wherever it leads, but that so far nothing substantiates the White House\u2019s Rice storyline. \u201dI have not seen any evidence or any indication of [anything] improper,\u201d Warner said. \u201dBut again, these are serious accusations against people affiliated with the Trump campaign.",
        "The opera firmament was shaken yesterday when a New York Times article, headlined \u201dThe Diva Departs: Ren\u00e9e Fleming\u2019s Farewell to Opera,\u201d landed online. The lengthy piece gave the impression that Fleming, a beloved star of classical music and one of the most successful sopranos of her generation, was ready to call it quits as far as opera was concerned. Her ostensible final performance would come on May 13 in Richard Strauss\u2019 Der Rosenkavalier at New York\u2019s Metropolitan Opera. The article begins with a wistful prelude probing Rosenkavalier\u2019s themes of farewell and letting go.",
        "On April 6, 1917, the U. S. declared war on Germany and formally entered World War I. By late June, American infantry troops began arriving in Europe. One thing they couldn\u2019t do without? Coffee. \u201dCoffee was as important as beef and bread,\u201d a Army official concluded after the war. A postwar review of the military\u2019s coffee supply concurred, stating that it \u201drestored courage and strength\u201d and \u201dkept up the morale.\u201d In fact, U.

        "April 6 marks 100 years since the U. S. Congress voted to declare war on Germany, entering World War I. The war took the lives of 17 million people worldwide. What\u2019s not as is the role that animals played at a time when they were still critical to warfare. Horses, in particular, served alongside troops on both sides, and several million died during the war. The animals were so crucial to the war effort that they also became military targets.",
        "During World War I, some 223 members of the U. S. Army Signal Corps performed a highly specialized service which demanded great skill, nerve and tenacity: Over the vast network of telephone lines that had been hastily constructed across France, these soldiers worked the complicated switchboards connecting the front lines with vital supply depots and military command. At the height of the fighting, they connected over 150, 000 calls per day. They had been specifically recruited for this task.",
        "World War I sometimes seems like the war America forgot. The U. S. entered the fight a century ago, on April 6, 1917, nearly three years after it erupted in Europe during the summer of 1914.
