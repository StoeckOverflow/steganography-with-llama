        "Back in the 1980s, Salman Rushdie believed that the defining figure of the 20th century was the migrant. I think his argument may be even truer of the 21st century. These days, the whole country, including our politics, is being transformed by migration. Few people understand the nuances of this reality more skillfully than Valeria Luiselli, a strikingly gifted political writer who knows the migratory pattern. Born in Mexico City to an Italian family, Luiselli spends her childhood in South Africa, her teens in Mexico and now resides in New York with her family and their kids.",
        "In an elaborate speech, Thailand \u2019 s king has signed the country \u2019 s constitution. The Constitution paves the way for Thailand to hold elections in the coming weeks, but critics say it only solidifies the role of the military.
