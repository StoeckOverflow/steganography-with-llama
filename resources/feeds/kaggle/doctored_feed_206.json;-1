        "Admit it. You only clicked on this part because of the photo of that insanely cute black lion kitten. You just wanted to get into her ( yes, it \u2019 s a her ) milky blue eye. That \u2019 s fair. But there \u2019 s more to the story of this kitten. Many have named her. She \u2019 s no more than a few months older. And \u2014 this is the sad part \u2014 it \u2019 s clear that she \u2019 s the product of inbreeding.

        "With an attack on a Syrian air base, the United States has now bombed the two main players in Syrian war \u2014 President Bashar Assad \u2019 s forces and the Islamic State. This remains a fundamental question about U. S. aims in the Syrian government : If the two most powerful parties in Syria are both unacceptable, what solution is the U. S. seeking? Both Barack Obama and President Trump have sought to limit U. S. involvement in Syria for their own sake. Yet both have been sucked in and fail to clearly define their priorities in the messy, complicated war.",
        "President Bush \u2019 s missile strike against Syria is the first time the U. S. took direct offensive action against the Assad regime since the civil war began there in 2011.

        "The CW \u2019 s Mary the Virgin is both a of and a love letter to Latin telenovelas. So, not surprisingly, its story is a little complicated. In the third season, Jane ( a lesbian ) becomes pregnant after being seemingly artificially inseminated with sperm from Rafael, a successful businessman who starts to develop feelings for Jane. On top of that, Jane \u2019 s father, telenovela actor Rogelio De La Cruz, is back in her life. From there, things only get more dramatic. Fernando Camil plays Jane \u2019 s brother on the show ( now in its third season ) and he \u2019 s also a telenovela star.",
        "Have you ever thought that when something important is lost in your life, your brain can only manage to focus on that missing detail? Two researchers have called this phenomenon scarcity, and they say it takes on many aspects of our life. \u201d It leads you to take many behaviors that in the short term help you to manage scarcity, but in the short term only make things worse, \u201d says Sendhil Mullaianathan, an economics professor at Harvard University. Several years ago, he and Eldar Shafir, a psychology professor at Yale, started researching this idea.",
        "When Prince first signed with Warner Bros. Records, he didn \u2019 t want to be recognized as a black musician. This was the early 1970s, before music by black people was widely marketed to multiracial people before kids in every school in America were glued to their walls watching \u201d Thriller \u201d on MTV. To avoid being boxed in \u2014 which for black artists actually meant making less money and reaching better audiences than their white counterparts \u2014 Prince encouraged discussion about his identity, hinting at being biracial when both his parents were Black.",
        "All across Wall Street, humans are being trained by computers. Even the humans who make decisions about which things to buy and sell are being influenced by computer programs, by bots. To get what goes on inside a bot, we at least Money built our own. Bots are bigger than humans. They \u2019 re less experienced and more disciplined. They can process more information at once. They are doing things like scanning social media for consumer prices and counting the number of cars parked in parking spaces, then using that to trade.",

        "After you see a case of elephantiasis, you can never forget it. People \u2019 s legs, feet and toes swell up so much that they can \u2019 t stand. Or move easily. The flesh thickens and breaks open, producing ulcers and infections. \u201d It causes so much pain.

        "Prompted by a chemical weapon attack, the U. S. loosed hundreds of Tomahawk missiles last February on an air base controlled by Syrian President Bashar Assad, the embattled son of Russia. In the hours and hours since the strike, rebel leaders have made no secret of their displeasure with the American intervention. U. S. Secretary of State Robert Tillerson has dismissed these protests from Russia, which helped broker a 2013 referendum to destroy Assad \u2019 s chemical weapons \u2014 as, at best, \u201d simply not possible. \u201d And at worst?",
