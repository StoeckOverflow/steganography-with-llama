        "President Clinton wants America to spend more \u201d clean coal \u201d to provide electricity. He hasn \u2019 t elaborated on what kind of energy that might be. But there is, in fact, a strategy to capture and contain or reuse one of coal \u2019 s worst pollutants \u2014 carbon dioxide, which warms the atmosphere. Though \u201d carbon capture \u201d has been beginning to catch on among those who oppose power plants ( see billions spent on research ) entrepreneurs are now starting to adapt the technologies for natural gas \u2014 electricity \u2019 s biggest competitor.

        "To get you to open a bottle of champagne, M. Michael Chilton, the face who was always behind the counter of my neighborhood department store in Brooklyn, would send out emails with different descriptions : \u201d I taste like sunshine, and I tell of brighter days ahead. I will make you forget that three guys cheated on you last week. I will make you forget that you didn \u2019 t say anything to your 401 ( k ).",
        "Film studios had an unusual opportunity this month to see classic films the way they were originally intended : on nitrate film stock. Nitrate film stock has been praised for the strength of its images and for truly allowing cinematographers to paint with light \u2014 shadows pop off the screen, colors are deep and rich, and grey tones shimmer. It \u2019 s also mildly flammable. Casablanca was the first film Genevieve McGillicuddy saw movies on nitrate. McGillicuddy is director of the TCM Classic Movie Festival, which sponsored the screenings.",
        "Most potential new drugs fail when they \u2019 re tested in people. These failures are not only a great disappointment, they sharply drive up the cost of developing new drugs. A major reason for these failures is that most new drugs are first tested out in humans, rats or other animals. Even those animal studies showed great promise. But humans aren \u2019 t simply furry little mammals, so these studies often lead science astray. Some scientists are now rethinking animal studies to make them more relevant for human health.",
        "It \u2019 s daunting to think about the variety of products Apple has created that have transformed how most people use technology : the original Macintosh with the first mouse, the iMac, the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad. But to 2017, and it appears that a lot of investment is coming from other companies. Google has a hit with its Echo, a new device that responds to voice commands. Reviewers say Samsung \u2019 s Surface competes with the Mac. And now, Samsung \u2019 s Galaxy S8 smartphone is getting raves because of its battery life and capacity.",
        "Sinkane opened its Jazz Desk Concert with a song that has been a kind of an anthem for me lately. \u201d album \u2019 Huh \u201d contains the Egyptian phrase \u201d kulu shi tamaam, \u201d which translates to \u201d life \u2019 s great \u2014 it \u2019 s all going to be all right. \u201d Sinkane is the music of Ahmed Gallab \u2014 and such great music it is.

        "The Trump Administration has accused former president Barack Obama of \u201d violence and irresolution \u201d for drawing a red border in Syria then failing to find it. In the days before and after last month \u2019 s cruise missile attacks, though, Trump \u2019 s own policy has drawn sometimes blurry and jagged lines. The administration has produced mixed signals about when and why it will deploy military force, the election of Syrian President Bashar Assad, and the risk it sees for Russia. 1. Support of military force, Trump campaigned on a nationalistic platform that rivals U. S. military actions in other parts of the globe.",
        "White House officials say the U. S. intelligence community is furious that Syrian President Bashar Assad attacked his own people with chemical missiles on April 4 \u2014 and that an alternative strategy offered by Russia is an effort to deflect blame and \u201d confuse the world community. \u201d Senior administration staff \u201d suggested that the attack may have been motivated by rebel fighters in the surrounding area, as government forces approached a suspected Syrian air base, \u201d NPR \u2019 s Scott Horsley argues. \u201d They said there was no consensus on whether the Russians were involved in the attack or had foreknowledge of it, \u201d he adds.",
        "On Nov. 18, 1978, an itinerant writer, faith healer and civil rights activist called the Rev. Jim Jones led more than 900 of his followers to support themselves by drinking Flavor Aid at their Jonestown camp in the jungle of Guyana. Even 40 years later, thoughts still linger regarding the Jonestown massacre and the man who inspired it. Journalist James Guinn details how Jones captivated his audience in his new book, The Journey to Jonestown.",
        "Updated : 6 : 33 p. m. ET, White House spokesman Sean Spicer informed Russia today that its collaboration with Syria is putting it \u201d on the right side of history, in a particularly bad way, quite quickly. \u201d The press correspondent found himself in the same situation just a day later, while trying to underscore the severity of Syria \u2019 s alleged possession of chemical weapons. \u201d You had one as despicable as Hitler who didn \u2019 t even admit to using chemical weapons, \u201d he said, overlooking the men who were gassed to death in Nazi concentration camps.",
        "A special meeting in Kansas on Tuesday has Trump sounding worried about an increasing gap in the Trump presidency. Trump himself was apparently happy enough that he cut a robo button for Republican state State Treasurer Ron Estes. \u201d On Tuesday, Republican Ron Estes gets your vote \u2014 and needs it back, \u201d the president says in the conference call intended to place Estes in the race to replace John Pompeo, who is serving as Trump \u2019 s finance director. \u201d Ron is a community leader who \u2019 s going to work with me to make American citizenship again.",
        "The reaction from the public started with gasps of breath and built to cries for a miracle. Now, a day and a half later, United Airlines is saying it did something wrong. On Friday night, a passenger on a United Express flight from Chicago to Louisville, Ky. was told he had to pick up his ticket so a United Airlines member could take his seat. The man said : He \u2019 s a doctor and said he had something he had to see.",
        "The violent removal of a United Airlines passenger from his seat on an overbooked flight Sunday has been a PR and stock market disaster for the company and a viral video phenomenon as far away as China. George Hobica, founder and of airfarewatchdog. com, says involuntary bumps from flights aren\u2019t that common \u2014 out of \u201dmillions and millions\u201d of passengers on United last year, 3, 000 to 4, 000 were bumped from flights, versus many hundreds of thousands of passengers who voluntarily gave up their seats.",
        "The Trump Organization is shutting down its New modeling agency. A statement released by the company said it was \u201dchoosing to exit the modeling industry.\u201d \u201dWhile we enjoyed many years of success, we are focussed on our core business in the real estate and golf industries and the rapid expansion of our hospitality division,\u201d the statement said. Started in 1999, Trump Model Management was part of Trump\u2019s eclectic array of businesses, though it was never as visible as some of the others and didn\u2019t play a major role in the fashion business.",
        "President Trump is responding to another tough foreign policy crisis with gunboat diplomacy, but the second deployment is likely to look very different from the first. U. S. Pacific Command has ordered the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson and its strike group, which includes a cruiser and two destroyers, to \u201dreport on station in the Western Pacific Ocean,\u201d instead of sailing for Australia as planned. The Navy\u2019s official announcement about the decision did not mention North Korea, but leaders in Washington hope that leaders in its capital, Pyongyang, will get the picture.",
        "North Korea is threatening \u201dtough counteraction\u201d after a U. S. Navy strike group was routed toward the Korean Peninsula following the rogue nation\u2019s continued ballistic missile and nuclear testing. \u201dWe never beg for peace but we will take the toughest counteraction against the provocateurs in order to defend ourselves by powerful force of arms and keep to the road chosen by ourselves,\u201d the official Korean Central News Agency reported in English, quoting a Foreign Ministry official. \u201dWe will hold the U. S.",
        "U. S. presidents have a tradition of entering office and expressing hope for improved relations with Russia. With near perfect symmetry, this is matched by a tradition of presidents leaving office amid friction with Moscow. Sometimes it takes years for optimism to turn to disillusionment. In the case of President Trump, there are warning signs after just a few months. \u201dIf we could get along with Russia, that\u2019s a positive thing,\u201d Trump said shortly after his inauguration.",
        "As congressional and FBI investigators in Washington explore potential ties between President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and Russian intelligence services\u2019 meddling in the election, they\u2019re searching for one particular clue: money. Loans, payments, sweetheart deals or other transactions are a tried and tested way that Russia\u2019s spy agencies get access to or control over people who interest them. The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, told NPR that evidence of such entanglements are one thing his panel is looking for.",
        "Rex Tillerson has touched down in Moscow. But well before his plane landed on the runway, heated words were already flying between the U. S. secretary of state and Russian officials over the situation in Syria. \u201dI hope that what the Russian government concludes is that they have aligned themselves with an unreliable partner in Bashar \u201d Tillerson said Tuesday at a meeting of foreign ministers in Lucca, Italy, shortly before he left for Russia. Tillerson made plain that the chemical attack last week in Syria was unacceptable to the U. S. and that the U. S.",
        "The burn unit at the U. S. Army Institute of Surgical Research in San Antonio, Texas, is hot. Sometimes, it gets up to 102 degrees in there, among the patients. People with severe burns can\u2019t regulate their own body temperatures well, so the air has to keep them warm. \u201dWe see a lot of gruesome stuff,\u201d says physical therapist Melissa Boddington. At the height of the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, more than 1, 000 wounded service members were flown to the hospital.",
        "When you\u2019re facing a major life change, it helps to talk to someone who\u2019s already been through it. All Things Considered is connecting people on either side of a shared experience, and they\u2019re letting us eavesdrop on their conversations in our series Been There. Charles Johnson\u2019s new job is tough. The training is minimal and expectations are high. It doesn\u2019t pay much \u2014 in fact, he still works his old job at a chemical plant. And to top it off, he has to answer to thousands of bosses. They\u2019re called voters. The new gig?",
        "Leo Brouwer is considered one of the most important living figures of classical music in Latin America. His works are played regularly in concert halls around the world, and he\u2019s scored more than 50 films. But at the age of 78, Brouwer finds it hard to reflect on his legacy. He\u2019s just grateful that people are moved by his music. \u201dTo be useful is something incredible, because you\u2019re at the service of the world,\u201d Brouwer says in Spanish. \u201dHumans, when they communicate, when they teach, when they show, when they give . ..",
        "The state attorney for Orange and Osceola counties has sued Gov. Rick Scott, alleging that he acted unconstitutionally when he removed her from 23 homicide cases. Scott had reassigned Aramis Ayala\u2019s cases to another state attorney by executive order because Ayala had declared her refusal to pursue the death penalty. \u201dThe Governor did not take this drastic step because of any misconduct on Ayala\u2019s part, but simply because he disagreed with her reasoned prosecutorial determination not to seek the death penalty under current circumstances,\u201d Ayala\u2019s attorney, Roy Austin, writes in her filing.",
        "Updated at 6:00 p. m. ET, Three explosions went off near the bus of Germany\u2019s Borussia Dortmund soccer team on Tuesday evening in the city of Dortmund, local police say. The team said on Twitter that one of its players, defender Marc Bartra, suffered a broken wrist and is being treated in a hospital. The injury required surgery. Initial reports suggest that the blasts were caused by \u201dserious explosives,\u201d potentially hidden in a bush near a parking lot, Dortmund police said in a statement. Police and prosecutors have not identified who is behind the explosions.",
        "It\u2019s been 25 years since the National Academy of Sciences set its standards for appropriate scientific conduct, and the world of science has changed dramatically in that time. So now the academies of science, engineering and medicine have updated their standards. The report published Tuesday, \u201dFostering Integrity in Research,\u201d shines a spotlight on how the research enterprise as a whole creates incentives that can be detrimental to good research. Robert Nerem, a professor emeritus of bioengineering at Georgia Tech, was not expecting that outcome when he agreed to chair the academy committee five years ago.",
        "New York state has passed legislation that would create the largest experiment in the country to offer free tuition at and colleges. The Excelsior Scholarship, approved over the weekend as part of the state budget, would cover students in the State University of New York system, which totals 64 campuses and 1. 3 million students. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, appeared with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and state education leaders in an event hailing the new program, which would begin this fall and is estimated to cost $163 million per year.",
        "Since he first announced his presidential campaign, Bernie Sanders has stuck to one simple promise. One that has many young people, in particular, #feelingthebern: free college. As Sanders put it in his New Hampshire victory speech: \u201dWhen we need the workforce in the world, yes, we are going to make public colleges and universities .\u201d The Pitch, There\u2019s a reason this promise has such powerful appeal. Earning some sort of postsecondary degree or certificate is more and more considered a necessity if you want to earn a living.",
        "When 1, 700 specialists in global health descended upon Washington, D. C. this past weekend, they brought suitcases full of data and experience. The Consortium of Universities for Global Health conference offered marathon sessions that covered everything from noncommunicable diseases and to climate science and injury prevention. We edit a daily email newsletter, Global Health NOW. But we found out there\u2019s still a lot to learn about our field. Here are some of the facts and figures that made an impression on us.

        "It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 that happens to be true: Bears love honey. And in Maryland, lawmakers have passed a bill making it legal to shoot a black bear if it threatens a beekeeper\u2019s hive. In February, state Del. Mike McKay testified before the Environment and Transportation Committee on behalf of the bill. He wore a vest festooned with the image of Winnie the Pooh. Del. Herb McMillan noted McKay\u2019s attire didn\u2019t seem to square with his arguments."
