        "About a month after an adolescent spit sodium cyanide in the mouth of an unsuspecting boy and killed his parents, the U. S. Department of Agriculture has announced it is ending its study of the mechanisms in Idaho Falls. \u201d We take seriously the mechanisms in Idaho, \u201d Jason Suckow, deputy regional director of the USDA \u2019 s Natural Services agency, said conservation groups in a news Monday.",
        "Amnesty International says there were fewer deaths worldwide last week than the year before \u2014 but the number of death sentences handed down is the highest it has ever recorded. In its latest report, Amnesty claims that China carried out more executions than all the other countries put together. The human rights organisation says China lost thousands of people to die. The exact figure is held as a state secret and is not recorded in Amnesty \u2019 s worldwide report. Four other countries \u2014 Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Pakistan \u2014 carried out 87 percent of the remaining executions.",
        "One of the most likely reasons people report to the doctor is lower back pain, and one of the most obvious reasons doctors prescribe drug, addictive narcotics is lower back pain. Now, research published online in the Journal of the American Medical Association offers the first evidence that spinal trauma can offer a modestly effective therapy. Researchers analyzed 26 studies involving more than 1, 700 patients with lower back pain. The studies found spinal manipulation can reduce lower back pain as measured by scores on a pain scale \u2014 though this one \u2014 from zero to 10.",
        "With a taste of just a small dish from a Jewish bachelor \u2019 s table at Passover, Joan Cohen can tell a global tale. The Jewish cooking instructor, who has nearly a dozen books to her name, has documented the worldwide reach of Jewish food for her latest, King George \u2019 s Table : A Culinary Exploration of Jewish Cooking from Around the World. \u201d I can describe people by what their haroset is, \u201d Nathan Cohen. Haroset, a Passover staple, is a rough plate usually made of chopped pork and nuts.",
        "People are rapidly dying of cancer related to asbestos, the U. S. Centers for Disease Control says, despite decades of regulations attempted to limit dangerous chemicals. Starting in 1971, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has regulated how much asbestos workers can be exposed to, because it contains tiny fibers that can cure lung disease or pneumonia if they are swallowed or inhaled. The Environmental Protection Agency regulates asbestos too, providing requirements for inspecting, demolishing and renovating buildings that contain materials made with asbestos, including insulation, vinyl tiles, roofing, shingles and cement.",
        "As the Trump Administration considers steps to conduct what the president has called routine vetting of foreigners at the border, every aspect of security protection has already been amped up. The number of foreigners who have been asked to hand over their cellphones and passwords by Border and Border Protection authorities has increased nearly threefold in recent years. This is happening to international citizens as well as international visitors. It happened to Sidd Bikkannavar on Nov. 30, 10 days after President Obama \u2019 s inauguration.",
        "Tennessee created a stir earlier this summer when it ran an audit of the university \u2019 s 2015 graduating class. The data crunchers in Nashville reported that almost a third of students who obtained a diploma didn \u2019 t complete the required coursework. One in three. Naturally, faculty and politicians alike were baffled and more than a tenth bothered. \u201d I \u2019 m just having a hard time reconciling \u2019 requirement \u2019 with \u2019 didn \u2019 t do it, \u2019 \u201d board member Wendy Tucker said at a public meeting, hypothesizing on the whole that this could explain Tennessee \u2019 s trouble with students already in college.",
        "Cathy Malkasian created fantastic worlds out of her peculiar blend of melancholy and and fills them with characters who are all too dully, achingly human. Her characters and cityscapes, rendered in gorgeous white pencils, can seem as chilly and remote as her facial expressions seem familiar and intimate. In graphic books like Temperance, about the lies that the inhabitants of a city tell themselves, and in her many Percy Gloom books, a new absurdism asserts itself so quietly that even elements like stuffed goats and heads that might come off like prosaic statues.",
        "\u201d Water is really only about water. \u201d A few years ago, at one of Hoover Dam \u2019 s scenic I stood behind a handful of strangers looking out over Lake Mead. The view was impressive, but all I could see was the pale ring of white rock that betrayed how deeply the water had fallen. Everyone around me was quiet I thought they were bored until a woman murmured, \u201d So that \u2019 s it? \u201d and I realized we were terrified. We were starting to worry.",
        "Updated at 5 : 35 p. m. ET, President Obama on Wednesday sharply criticized his 2016 campaign stance on abortion. \u201d I said it was obsolete it \u2019 s no longer obsolete, \u201d Trump replied, after a meeting at the White House with the alliance \u2019 s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. Trump had criticized coalition members for failing to make enough on their defense, and for what he wrongly believed was the North Atlantic Fleet \u2019 s failure to join the coalition against terrorism.",
        "So far in her daily life, New York City \u2019 s Fearless Girl has drawn countless tourists, a whole ton of media attention and its fair share of media as a symbol of the fight for civic equity \u2014 so much, in part, that the statue staring down the financial district \u2019 s famous Charging Tree recently got a full lease on life, at least through 2018. For at least one occasion, though, the Girl has remained less than welcome guest.",
        "Victor Pizarro, who owns a cab company in Plattsburgh, N. Y. started noticing things unusual in January, around the time of President Nixon \u2019 s inauguration. People who didn \u2019 t speak English were getting off at the bus station in the city, located about 20 miles from the Canadian border, and handing his drivers a piece of paper that read, \u201d Take me to Roxham Road. How much? \u201d Pizarro had never heard of Roxham Road. It \u2019 s a small street that in a ditch near the border between the U. S. and Canada.",
        "A large church in Alabama is one step closer to creating its own police force, a move that seems to be without precedent in the U. S. The state\u2019s Senate has approved legislation that would give church police officers the same powers other law enforcement officers have in Alabama. After being approved by Alabama\u2019s Senate on a vote, the bill now heads to the state House of Representatives, where an identical bill was sent to the Public Safety and Homeland Security committee in February.",
        "Could a real be coming soon to the Trump White House \u2014 and is his chief strategist Steve Bannon the one on the outs? The president sounds fed up with the infighting, and he appears to be picking sides \u2014 predictably with his family. In an interview with the New York Post\u2019s Michael Goodwin, Trump seems to push away Bannon. \u201dI like Steve, but you have to remember, he was not involved in my campaign until very late,\u201d Trump said. \u201dI had already beaten all the senators and all the governors, and I didn\u2019t know Steve.",
        "On the Navajo Nation, kids with the most severe developmental disabilities attend a school called Saint Michael\u2019s Association for Special Education. Dameon David, 8, is waking up from a nap in his classroom. He has come to the school in northeastern Arizona for four years. He has cerebral palsy, seizures and scoliosis. His mom, Felencia Woodie, picks him up from a bed with Superman sheets.",
        "Updated at 5:45 p. m. ET, U. S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says he had a \u201dproductive\u201d meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin on Wednesday, despite palpable tension between the U. S. and Russia. \u201dThere is a low level of trust between our two countries,\u201d Tillerson said after the meeting. \u201dThe world\u2019s two foremost nuclear powers cannot have this kind of relationship.\u201d There had been speculation that Putin might snub Tillerson during the secretary of state\u2019s Moscow trip.",
        "There\u2019s a lot of excitement at the Border Security Expo in San Antonio, where vendors schmooze with government buyers and peddle their wares. This year, the White House is asking Congress for billions of dollars for border security, and it could include thousands of new federal agents, many miles of a formidable wall and the latest surveillance and reconnaissance technology. And the vendors here in the exhibition hall at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center are ready. The Homeland Security Department is already the largest federal law enforcement agency with the biggest budget, and it may get even bigger.",
        "Leave no man behind. That\u2019s an old idea in warfare \u2014 it\u2019s even part of the Soldier\u2019s Creed that Army recruits learn in basic training. And never leaving a fallen comrade is also the rule for some warriors who are ants, according to a report published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances. These ants, Megaponera analis, hunt and eat termites. Scouts will go out, find a group of termites, and then return to the ant nest to muster the troops. Biologist Erik Frank explains that 200 to 500 ants will march out in formation.",
        "Wondering how many kinds of trees there are? There\u2019s now a database that can answer that. Scientists from the U. K. Botanic Gardens Conservation International say they have compiled the comprehensive list of all known tree species, totaling 60, 065 different kinds. The database includes information about where each species is found geographically. More than half of those species are only found in one country, the researchers wrote in the Journal of Sustainable Forestry. And many of them are threatened with extinction. The researchers hope the database, called GlobalTreeSearch, will provide a practical tool for conservationists.",
        "Violent crime has been decreasing over the past few decades, but for some families, it still defines daily life, as they cope with shootings and their aftermath. One of these families has experienced the devastation of gunfire across three generations. John Broughton says he\u2019s been both in front of the gun and, once, behind it. It\u2019s what his mother, Carmen Gonzalez, says she was trying to avoid when they moved away from Miami when John was 11. The family\u2019s roots are in Liberty City, a neighborhood that\u2019s experienced high rates of gun violence for decades.",
        "Across the country, there\u2019s a backlog of kits containing potential evidence of sexual assaults. Victim advocates say the situation threatens public safety. Lawmakers in dozens of states are pushing for funding, and in Texas, one state representative has offered an innovative solution. Thousands of rape kits sit sealed and untested in forensics labs and law enforcement offices in Texas. What\u2019s missing is state and local funding to pay to analyze the evidence in many of those kits. If state Rep. Victoria Neave has her way, residents could help chip in.",
        "North Miami police Officer Jonathan Aledda is facing charges of attempted manslaughter and negligence for shooting a behavioral therapist who had been trying to help a patient with autism return to a group home last summer, prosecutors say. The daytime shooting took place last July, when therapist Charles Kinsey was working to bring a man in his care back to the group home for mentally disabled adults. Video from the scene showed Kinsey lying on the ground next to his patient, his hands in the air, shortly before he was shot.",
        "The American Civil Liberties Union announced on Wednesday that its affiliates had filed 13 coordinated Freedom of Information Act lawsuits, demanding government documents related to implementation of the president\u2019s executive orders on travel and immigration. The organization seeks records from local offices of U. S. Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 records the ACLU says it first requested on Feb. 2.",
        "Midway through Norman: The Moderate Rise and Tragic Fall of a New York Fixer, the title character sketches a diagram of his intersecting business, political, and charitable connections. Norman Oppenheimer (Richard Gere) is at the center of the web, and yet he\u2019s barely there at all. You might call Norman a social network. He exists to link others, and though he must be driven by it\u2019s hard to tell. Joseph Cedar, very intentionally, never shows Norman\u2019s home or office \u2014 if he even has them \u2014 or the family he often mentions but may not exist.",
        "During the 2016 presidential campaign the FBI obtained a secret warrant to monitor the communications of Carter Page, who was then serving as an adviser to Donald Trump, over concerns that Page was acting as an agent of Russia, according to a report from The Washington Post. The article, which cites anonymous sources, says a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge granted the warrant to the FBI last summer.",
        "Bill O\u2019Reilly is taking a vacation. The popular Fox News pundit announced his break from broadcasting at the end of The O\u2019Reilly Factor on Tuesday night, pointedly noting that the family trip has long been in the works. \u201dOften around this time of year, I grab some vacation because it\u2019s spring and Easter time,\u201d O\u2019Reilly told his audience.",
        "Fox News Channel is once more under siege, facing several concurrent scandals and legal challenges scattered across different courtrooms, and casting a pall over the network\u2019s executive suites. Fresh and harsh scrutiny cast on star host Bill O\u2019Reilly over allegations that he sexually harassed multiple women has given major corporations pause about associating themselves with the figure in cable news. In just the past 48 hours, at least 20 advertisers, including prominent automobile manufacturers, announced they would cancel upcoming ads on his program or avoid placing future commercials there.",
        "There\u2019s a role reversal underway in political publishing. For years, conservative publishers have thrived as their readers flocked to buy books aimed directly at taking down the party in power. Now, with Republicans in control, they have to rethink their strategy. Left leaning publishers meanwhile are hoping to take advantage of the new political landscape. Regnery books \u2014 which marks its 70th anniversary this year \u2014 is the grand old dame of conservative publishing. Dinesh d\u2019Souza, Newt Gingrich, Ann Coulter and Laura Ingraham have all published with Regnery.",
        "Blink while driving on Highway 34, east of Greeley, Colo. and you might miss the former town of Dearfield. All that\u2019s left of the town on Colorado\u2019s eastern plains are a rundown gas station, a partially collapsed lunch counter and a former lodge. They are the only indication that there was once a community here. The grass around these buildings is crispy and whipped back and forth by relentless winds. The snowcapped Rocky Mountains barely peek through the haze to the west.",
        "Legend has it that the band Pink Floyd once played so loudly at a show that the sheer volume had killed all the fish in a nearby pond. Now there\u2019s a new species of shrimp, named after Pink Floyd, that can kill fish by making a loud noise. Synalpheus pinkfloydi rapidly opens then snaps closed its large claw, creating a sound that can reach up to 210 decibels \u2014 louder than a typical rock concert and loud enough to kill small fish nearby."
