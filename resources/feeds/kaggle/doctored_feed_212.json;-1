And because of their numbers, they have far more success than the philanthropists of the past, argues John Callahan, author of a new study on philanthropy, The Givers : Wealth, Power and Philanthropy in a New Gilded Age.",

        "It \u2019 s easy enough for people who live in America to hail a ride, usually from a taxi or a service like Uber or Lyft. There \u2019 s plenty of demand, and hundreds of drivers. A startup is trying to offer a similar service to Central America, but it has required some deep thinking. The town of Van Wert sits on the western tip of Ohio. It \u2019 s a stretch of old farm country punctuated with gas silos and a stone castle that \u2019 s serving as the nation \u2019 s first modern public library.

But then there are the hard decisions \u2014 the ones we agonize over, the ones that lead to sleepless nights.
