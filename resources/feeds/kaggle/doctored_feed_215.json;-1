The building staff and mother has soured on the men in the city, finding them too weak, unrealistic or optimistic. Though she identifies as feminist, da Silva had also voted for the party, Broad Front. But after watching its leader and presidential candidate, Marine Le Pen, delivering a speech against globalization, the European environment and immigration to a packed club in Paris, da Silva said she found a world she can believe in.",
        "The French went to the polls Sunday to face ballots in the first week of a political race like no other in France \u2019 s recent history : Entrenched politicians have been swept away, with fringe candidates and untested newcomers filling the void. After Sunday, the total of 11 presidential candidates will be broken down to two contenders, who will face each other in a debate on May 7. The top ten candidates offer starkly realistic visions for the country. Yet they are so close in the polls that the future is impossible to predict.",
        "The Food and Drug Administration says children under 12 should not be given prescription medications that contain codeine or another narcotic, tramadol, and that such drugs can also be dangerous to infants between 12 and 18. On Thursday, the FDA announces it will require that prescription medications containing codeine or tramadol carry a prohibition on the label against using them in women under 12 or in women who are.

It \u2019 s the largest summary dismissal of convictions in U. S. history, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Thursday \u2019 s dismissals by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court had been expected after Massachusetts district attorneys on Boston submitted lists of 21, 587 suspects they said they would be reassigned or unable to prosecute, The Associated Press reports.",
        "The United States spends the most on health care per person \u2014 $ 9, 237 \u2014 according to two new estimates published in the journal The Lancet. France spends the least \u2014 just $ 33 per person. The data covering 184 countries was collected and analyzed by the Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network, a network of scientists from around the world with interests in various aspects of health care. In between those two extremes, the cost is quite literally all over the world. And the amount of spending doesn \u2019 t usually translate into better health care.",
        "The woman opposing the Justice Department \u2019 s allegations of foreign meddling into the 2016 election and past ties between the Trump administration and Russia has told family members she will leave the bench in May. Mary J. McCord has served at the highest levels in the national security force, either as its leader or chief deputy, for the past four years.

        "Updated at 6 : 00 p. m. ET, General Electric has stopped operations in February after its only plant there was illegally acquired by authorities, the automaker says in a statement. The details are murky : Multiple workers at the plant tell police that they believe auto manufacturers, not government officials, were responsible for the takeover. The seizure happened Wednesday, as the \u201d mother of all protests \u201d brought hundreds of millions of people into the streets to march against socialist President Jos\u00e9 Maduro.",
        "It was a trifecta of conservative debate in the White House last night. Ted Nugent, a longtime Trump supporter Kid Rock, who \u2019 s been known to be anything but marijuana and former Texas Gov. Sarah Palin all gathered in the Oval Office for a quick video shoot to go over some things and have a little dinner. All four jumped on the Trump banner early in the primary campaign and appeared at numerous times on Trump \u2019 s behalf in the week leading up to his election win last November.",
        "When Nermeen Ileiwat first attended college, she could not hope to get into a relationship \u2014 perhaps even get pregnant before graduation. But after one day, the rising sophomore thought she had no idea what she wanted out of college and was in no position to get into a relationship. That decision didn \u2019 t last long. Only a few months after, Ileiwat met someone at a party, and their friendship slowly turned into something more. Apparently, dating was not that simple for the now who are teenagers.

        "It used to be that young Muslims who wanted a halal wedding had to live in a major city and know a good life. Want to find an ideal spouse? Get your father involved. In the market for halal cosmetics? Good luck. Times are different though. Across the U. S. the Muslim population is booming. It \u2019 s expected to reach six billion in 15 years, more than double its current number.

When it comes to John Stetson \u2019 s music, joy is lost in the improbable and seemingly impossible feat. It \u2019 s often been said that Stetson \u2019 s signature sound \u2014 hallucinogenic rhythmic swells using just a saxophone, a pair of guitars and some microphones \u2014 is almost supernatural. It \u2019 s made even more incredible by the fact that Stetson prefers single tracks, with no looping or overdubbing.",
        "It began with a simple idea: provide a safe place in Boston where and former gang members can work out, find support and maybe even get a job. The result is InnerCity Weightlifting, a nonprofit also known as ICW that connects them with job training, workout clients and a chance at a new life. Just about all of the trainers have done significant time in jail. They\u2019ve shot people and been shot at. Dan Royal grew up in Boston and was 11 the first time he was arrested on a shooting charge. \u201dI got shot before that.",
        "Nearly 1. 5 million Americans were treated for addiction to prescription opioids or heroin in 2015, according to federal estimates, and when those people get seriously hurt or need surgery, it\u2019s often not clear, even to many doctors, how to safely manage their pain. For some former addicts, what begins as pain relief ends in tragedy. Max Baker is one such case. He started using prescription pain pills as a teenager in New England and quickly moved on to heroin. His father, Dr. James Baker, is a physician in the Worcester, Mass.",
        "Beans, beans, the magical fruit, Healthy, tasty, And useful, to boot! Save that canned water, And whip it to foam, It\u2019s an replacement, Made right at home! OK, so it\u2019s not the playground rhyme you grew up with. But with the avid following that canned bean water \u2014 more appetizingly known as \u201daquafaba\u201d \u2014 has gained in just a few short years, maybe it\u2019s time that rhyme got rewritten.

        "Last December The Ottoman Lieutenant, a love story set in Turkey during World War I, came and went in the blink of an eye. The movie was pretty terrible in its own right and, as critics pointed out, its Turkish funding guaranteed a memory hole about Turkey\u2019s 1915 massacre of over a million of its Armenian citizens, an act generally deemed by historians a genocide that Turkish authorities refuse to acknowledge to this day.",
        "Residents of the Canadian town of Ferryland, a small fishing village in Newfoundland, recently welcomed a new visitor: a huge iceberg that ran aground just offshore. Watching icebergs is a Newfoundland tradition, and Ferryland owner Maxine Dunne can see this iceberg outside her window. She tells NPR\u2019s David Greene that she and her husband, Charlie, have seen some pretty large icebergs over the years because they live along what is known as \u201diceberg alley,\u201d for the frequency with which icebergs float by after breaking off of glaciers on Greenland or in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.",

        "Note: NPR\u2019s First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the Spotify or Apple Music playlist at the bottom of the page. If Willie Nelson hadn\u2019t fashioned himself into the artist he is over the course of thousands of performances and some albums, who could\u2019ve dreamed him up? He\u2019s been the epitome of consistency, each of his shows an easygoing epic, each album loosely held together by a narrative or stylistic thread, each project expanding on country\u2019s troubadour tradition.",
        "When U. S. intelligence agencies spy on Americans, they\u2019re supposed to get a warrant. But what happens when they\u2019re spying on a foreigner and an American calls up? The way intelligence agencies handle what they call this \u201dincidental\u201d collection of information \u2014 and what political leaders eventually do with it \u2014 will be a big part of the next phase in Congress\u2019 investigations about the Russian interference in last year\u2019s presidential election.

        "A remark U. S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions made earlier this week about a judge in Hawaii isn\u2019t sitting well with the Aloha State. In an interview on the The Mark Levin Show, Sessions was asked about the status of President Trump\u2019s executive order on travel. \u201dI really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the president of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and constitutional power,\u201d Sessions replied.

        "What do you want to know about world hunger? One thing we do know is that more than 20 million people are now at risk of starvation and famine. The United Nations is calling it the biggest humanitarian crisis since the U. N. was founded in 1945. Conflict and drought are blamed for the looming crisis in four countries in Africa and the Middle East: Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia and northeast Nigeria. Our blog has been covering the story.
