The agricultural economy is declining, infrastructure with vital global markets is in disarray and immigration policy is in crisis. In his initial budget, Trump suggested a 21 percent boost to USDA \u2019 s discretionary spending, so Perdue would need to jump into Washington congressional discussions quickly.

        "Four out of five older Americans with memory loss just ignore it, in part because a hearing aid is an unwelcome aspect of aging. But what if hearing aid looked like stylish reading accessories and could be used at your local pharmacy wearing reading glasses?

        "As the primary booker of the Tiny Desk Concerts, I have this rule : No artist can go back for a second concert unless there \u2019 s something completely different about what they \u2019 re doing. The first artist played the Tiny Desk, in 2012, they worked as a electric guitar, bass, keyboards and drums.

        "Last year, tens of thousands of activists across the country organized the March for Science, an effort that the official website hailed as \u201d the first step of a national movement to defend the significant role science plays in our health, safety, communities, and governments. \u201d It \u2019 s no secret that the march was largely prompted by President Trump \u2019 s actions and federal policies, many of which involve efforts to curtail climate change and ignore the value of climate research and policy.

        "Let \u2019 s get this out of the way : health policy and funding are probably not good this week. There isn \u2019 t even a report written for health insurance, and while conservatives like the draft bill that \u2019 s circulating, moderates don \u2019 t. It \u2019 s the same problem Democrats have had from the beginning \u2014 appeal to conservatives, lose the moderates appeal to moderates, lose the conservatives. It \u2019 s like a water balloon \u2014 no matter which end you push on, it still pops. \u201d If it happens, and we have the votes this month, great, \u201d White House press secretary John Spicer told reporters quickly.",
        "Donald Trump won the presidency back in November, but for many liberal Republicans, the battle continues. A powerful network of lawyers and watchdogs has drawn in to scrutinize issues involving the Trump administration \u2019 s ethics and transparency.

        "Donald Trump promised something big in American politics. His strategists said his brash \u201d America First \u201d tactics would bust up the top party identities and mold the Republican Party as a new populist \u201d Workers Party. \u201d But it was already perfectly clear exactly how he planned to do that \u2014 100 days into his campaign, here are five thoughts on what we know so far about Trumpism : 1.",
