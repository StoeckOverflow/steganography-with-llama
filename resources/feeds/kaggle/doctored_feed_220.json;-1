        "The president said on a tweetstorm Thursday hyping the idea of a legislative shutdown and blaming Democrats on a variety of factors : But Congress isn \u2019 t likely waiting for a shutdown. It is likely to vote on a proposed measure Thursday or tomorrow that would keep the system open for another day. And negotiators are working on a plan to leave the government for the rest of the decade. So what \u2019 s going on?",
        "The Pentagon is questioning whether Michael Flynn broke the law by obtaining money from a foreign country after retiring from the service, referring to a letter written by the Secretary of Defense \u2019 s acting inspector general to House Oversight director Jason Chaffetz. News of the letter, which was released by House Oversight committee member Elijah James Thursday, comes as Chaffetz is telling the Pentagon to consider making Flynn forfeit hundreds of millions of dollars to make up for debt from entities linked to the interests of Russia and Turkey.",
        "Updated at 12 : 30 p. m. ET The Republican chairmen of the House and Senate Appropriations committees have mentioned the idea of a spending bill to keep the government alive while budget negotiations begin. The spending measure, proposed by House Appropriations Chairman Nancy Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, would put off the deadline to November 5. \u201d I am optimistic that a final budget package will be completed today, \u201d Frelinghuysen said.",

What makes a movie personal? Obviously, stories are often confessional, but only some go public enough to expose truth. They \u2019 re as likely to mine secrets from distant sources : photographs, overheard conversations, someone else \u2019 s memories. A book can make anything personal, anyway, so maybe the problem \u2019 s moot. If a soda commercial is done while you fall in love, it \u2019 s your choice.",
        "Looking back at the 1992 Los Angeles riots, people often encounter tensions between white law enforcement officers and black small business people. That story gets even more complicated when you step into \u2014 a neighborhood that was, and still is, predominantly racist. In the wake of the Rodney King verdict, riots broke out around the city. The first day, they erupted in Grand Central by the second, they had marched north to.",
        "Be honest : You \u2019 re staring at this story thinking what value is there to add to reports on the 1992 strike that rocked LA, OK? NPR has done several retrospectives before, including a huge on the 20th. But in the past five years, the nature of policing \u2014 how it \u2019 s done, whether it \u2019 s equitable, what happens when deadly confrontations become \u2014 has become more urgent than needed. And what happened in Los Angeles that April night 25 years ago is a critical aspect of the current national perspective on policing and race. For the LAPD, there have been big changes.",

ET, United Airlines and lawyers for the passenger passengers on video being dragged from a jet airliner in Chicago say the airline has reached \u201d an amicable settlement \u201d with the passengers. The terms of the agreement were not changed. A statement released by the US law firm of Corboy and Demetrio said \u201d Dr.",
        "United Airlines is increasing the amount it will allow passengers who get bumped from overbooked flights to as much as $ 10, 000. That announcement comes after its CEO, Luis Munoz, called a video wherein police violently knocked a seated passenger off a passenger flight earlier this afternoon \u201d horrifying. \u201d \u201d When we read that story, our answer was, \u2019 Dang, I wish we \u2019 d been on that flight, \u2019 \u201d says Fay Fishman, a veteran traveler with a history of getting bumped off overbooked planes.",
        "It was a standard feature on Instagram back in May 2016 : Four women, all smiling in their Marine Corps uniforms. Then Garner copied it and posted it to a small group. \u201d And I watched in real time as hundreds of people commented on this photo and said things like they want to rape us, \u201d Mrs. Janine Garner told Judge Ari Shapiro on NPR \u2019 s All Things Considered. Garner sought permission from each of her fellow volunteers to post the picture to her Facebook Instagram account. They all agreed. What they didn \u2019 t react to was the harassment that came first.",
        "Even President President Trump calls the measure \u201d ridiculous, \u201d the White House is still touting what little press release called the president \u2019 s \u201d historic legacy \u201d \u2014 including 28 laws he has drafted since taking office. But when it comes to legislation, social scientists say it is easier to measure significance than to even add up the number of states. It is better, they argue, to predict whether a law removes the status quo or introduces a national policy idea. By that stage, there is not as much to show for law \u2019 s first 100 days.",
        "Nearly 100 days into his administration, President Reagan has drastically reduced the rate of immigration, both legal and illegal, to the U. S. He \u2019 s been able to accomplish that without any new law \u201d and without many of his political ideas solidly in place, without executive orders that have been placed on hold by the courts and a tough wall on the Mexican government. In a matter of months, the new administration has made it easier to get into the U. S for all types of people.",
        "President Trump has said over and over that creating jobs is at the top of his agenda. It may seem unfair to waste his progress on this goal in his next 100 days, but Trump has opened the door to scrutiny by supporting his own assertions on job creation. During a White House meeting with CEOs on September 11, Trump claimed his administration had already created over 600, 000 jobs. \u201d You see what \u2019 s going on. You see the numbers, \u201d he said.",
        "Don\u2019t be distracted by the title of Netflix\u2019s latest, TV series, Dear White People. Because, one look at this insightful, irreverent examination of race and society at an Ivy League college reveals it really doesn\u2019t focus much on white folks at all. Indeed, the title Dear White People is a bit of a head fake. This slyly assembled series is really about how a wide range of black and brown students at the fictional, predominantly white Winchester University deal with race, sexual orientation and other identity stuff in the modern age.",
        "As Republicans in Congress debate changes to the Affordable Care Act, insurance executives across the country are trying to make plans for next year. Companies that sell policies on the exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, face deadlines to inform states about what plans they want to sell, and what they intend to charge. \u201dInsurance companies need to file rates in 2 months,\u201d says Tom Policelli, CEO of Minuteman Health, which sells Obamacare policies in Massachusetts and New Hampshire.",
        "Not my avocados! President Trump\u2019s tough talk on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada has raised many questions \u2014 including how such a move might negatively affect the flow of beloved produce to the U. S. Like the avocado. Americans ate 2 billion pounds of avocados last year, of which were imported \u2014 mostly from Mexico. That\u2019s because avocados grow in Mexico\u2019s climate \u2014 but not in California\u2019s. But researchers in the Golden State \u2014 America\u2019s biggest producer of the green fruit \u2014 are working to change that.",
        "Arkansas is scheduled to execute convicted murderer Kenneth William tonight, who has been on death row since 2000. Williams is set to be the fourth and final inmate executed there this month, after the state initially scheduled eight condemned inmates to die over 11 days \u2014 the fastest pace of executions in decades. The state justifies its aggressive schedule by saying that one of the drugs used in lethal injections, midazolam, expires at the end of April. It says it will have trouble finding a new supply. But critics have characterized the packed schedule as reckless and .",
        "Arkansas, which has been in a race to execute inmates before a key lethal drug expires, plans to hold its final execution in the series Thursday night. Attorneys for the condemned men have put forth arguments about their innocence, intellectual abilities, mental states and about the execution procedure. But what happens to those debates after an execution? Ledell Lee was the first inmate executed this month in Arkansas. There was scant physical evidence tying him to the murder he was convicted of, and he was never given a DNA test before his execution.",
        "Ohio Gov. John Kasich says the discourse that came out during the 2016 presidential campaign was beyond what he could have imagined, and he still doesn\u2019t understand how politicians got away with it. He was shocked by \u201dthe kind of rhetoric and the negativity and the and the kind of acid that was being spilled out there in the public dialogue,\u201d Kasich tells NPR\u2019s David Greene. \u201dIn my job, you make one of those statements and you\u2019re dead, you know? But it seemed like none of this ever mattered.",
        "NASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft is giving earthlings their views of Saturn\u2019s swirled atmosphere and its massive hurricane, beaming a trove of images and data back to Earth after the craft made its first dive between Saturn and its rings Wednesday. Cassini is \u201dshowing us new wonders and demonstrating where our curiosity can take us if we dare,\u201d said Jim Green, director of NASA\u2019s Planetary Science Division. The raw images are being fed into a photo stream on NASA\u2019s website, and while they lack detailed captions and annotations, they provide entrancing views of the planet\u2019s complex atmosphere.",
        "Accessing the Internet in Cuba isn\u2019t easy. Home Internet connections are rare, and public access hotspots costs $1. 50 an hour \u2014 very expensive for most Cubans. But in the nation that has been called \u201done of the most restrictive media environments in the world,\u201d watching YouTube got faster this week. Google says that its servers just went live on the island \u2014 meaning that for the first time, its services like YouTube videos are cached locally, instead of in a neighboring country.",
        "New York City is set to begin giving body cameras to its police officers on Thursday. Under the police department\u2019s pilot program, 1, 200 officers in 20 precincts will receive the cameras. The officers will also be studied by scientists to see what effect the cameras have on policing. As police don body cameras across the country, scientists are increasingly working with departments to figure out how the cameras change behavior \u2014 of officers and the public. \u201dIs the camera having an impact on the way officers use force? Is it reducing the number of citizens\u2019 complaints?",
        "In 1888, the match girls of London went on strike. Their reason was a particularly horrifying working condition: ingesting phosphorus. A girl with \u201dphossy jaw\u201d would literally glow in the dark as her jawbone slowly disintegrated. This strike was a fight for their lives. Against expectations, they won \u2014 a watershed for Victorian industrial workers. Later strikers invoked the match girls as inspiration girls who\u2019d come together so something so dangerous couldn\u2019t happen again.",
        "Unlike my fellow Americans, the news of a Detroit doctor being arrested for performing female genital ( ) did not shock me. I grew up in the same religious sect (Dawoodi Bohra) as the doctor, and years earlier, in 1990, before U. S. federal legislation criminalizing existed, I too was cut. I only recall small bits of what happened to me. My family was in India visiting relatives. My mother and aunt took me to a stranger\u2019s apartment. The door opened. In front of us stood elderly women in sarees. They laughed, the atmosphere felt relaxed.",
        "From the front door of the gift shop at the Alnwick Garden in the far northeast of England, the scene looks innocent enough. A sapphire green English lawn slopes gently downward, toward traditional, ornamental gardens of rose and bamboo. Across the small valley, water cascades down a terraced fountain. But a hundred or so plantings kept behind bars in this castle\u2019s garden are more menacing \u2014 and have much to tell visitors about poison and the evolutionary roots of medicine.",
        "Amelia Meath and Nick Sanborn each spent time in bands that never made it big. But when the two of them joined up to create Sylvan Esso, everything changed. They started filling up music venues, became famous internationally and almost immediately started to feel pressure to make magic a second time. Now, three years after the band\u2019s debut, Sylvan Esso has a sophomore album, out Friday. The name of the record, What Now, offers some insight into how Meath and Sanborn felt making it.",
        "Peter Ssali makes his living on Lake Victoria. Most days he fishes on Africa\u2019s largest lake. Sometimes he ferries cargo to the lake\u2019s islands or gives tours to sightseers on the small boat he leases for around $5 a day. The Ugandan with a scruffy beard and shaved head has been on the lake pretty much every day for the last 12 years. But he can\u2019t swim. He\u2019s also distrustful of the life jacket in the corner of his small wooden boat. He calls it \u201dfake\u201d and \u201dcheap\u201d and says it wouldn\u2019t help if he capsized.",
        "A few weeks ago, my husband brought home a bottle of chilled beverage that wasn\u2019t on the grocery list I had sent him out with. It was a bottle of sugarcane juice \u2014 a novelty in a market flooded with bottled soda and mango drinks. But one sip of the drink and I was transported back to my childhood summers. I grew up in the southern city of Chennai, where summers are scorching. And sugarcane juice was a popular seasonal cooler. I would stop for a tall glass of freshly pressed juice from a street vendor on hot afternoons.",
        "As the 50th anniversary of the greatest rock album of all time rapidly nears, Capitol Records is sharing a previously unreleased outtake from the Sgt. Pepper\u2019s recording sessions. The clip, premiered at The Guardian, is a version of the album\u2019s opening title cut and includes some fantastic chatter between John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison. It\u2019s an unadorned and intimate version of the song that offers a glimpse into how The Beatles first imagined the track. It\u2019s also disorienting to hear it without any of the horns or sound effects (there\u2019s no cheering crowd or laughter).",

        "The Circle, the film based on the novel by Dave Eggers, presents a dystopian view of the direction Silicon Valley is taking the world. And, as a longtime Silicon Valley correspondent, I have to say there is a lot that this comic and spooky film gets right. Let\u2019s start with the main character, Mae, a recent college grad played by Emma Watson. Mae is eager, idealistic and versed in the kind of marketing verbiage that rolls off the tongues of way too many young people in Silicon Valley."
