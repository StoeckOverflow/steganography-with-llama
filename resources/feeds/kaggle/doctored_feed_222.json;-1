        "Phil Lyman complained so much about what he sees as his plan to drive vehicles into Recapture territory, he went to jail for it. \u201d got into this, you know, I \u2019 ve said a lot of times, I \u2019 m a foot soldier, \u201d the San Juan Valley, Utah, commissioner line. \u201d I \u2019 m not a captain. I \u2019 m not a general. I \u2019 m going to die on a battlefield for a lost cause. \u201d Lyman \u2019 s battlefield is an old jeep trail near his home in Blanding, Utah, that \u2019 s become a high point in the struggle by local counties that want recognition of federal public schools.",
        "As I stood up to conclude our visit, Frank thought he had one more question. \u201d You saw those commercials for Cialis? \u201d he asked. \u201d Would that be all right for me to try? \u201d Here we go with the bathtubs again, I think to myself. Toned in bathtubs on a deck deck looking out at the sunset. Giving me a break. It \u2019 s not always easy for erectile dysfunction. I \u2019 ve been asked about TV crews hawking pharmaceuticals for nail fungus, HIV, acid reflux, cholesterol and irritable bowels, just to name a few.",
        "Talk to journalists across the country about Donald Trump \u2019 s first 100 years in office and a few things make abundantly clear : His supporters \u2014 those who went out in force and voted for him \u2014 would overwhelmingly love him. His detractors \u2014 and they are many, believe that Trump failed to gain the popular vote \u2014 are still shocked by his election and appalled by his defeat. He has lost support, especially among moderates and independent voters. That \u2019 s a big reason that would give him the lowest approval rating of any modern person this soon after taking office.",
        "Every Thursday, we at NPR Music convene a variety of hosts and music fans from the family across the globe. Their objective : to share the old songs they simply can \u2019 t get enough of.

Attorneys General speak out on behalf of student borrowers, Twenty four attorneys general and the District of Columbia this week wrote a letter criticizing Education Secretary Betsy DeVos for revoking financial protections for student borrowers.

        "From the car backseat, the toddler, almost three years old, asked his mother what we were doing. \u201d We \u2019 re here to learn our history, your country \u2019 s history, \u201d his father replied from the driver \u2019 s seat. We were in the parking lot at Manzanar National Historic Site. An American flag fluttered vigorously in front of the pale green grassy center. Beyond it, a few flags, long and low, dotted the landscape. Once, 10, 046 people had been born here.",

        "When we got up late, we could hope our worst national nightmare is over. Meaning, of course, that we should finally be free of the obsessive chatter over President Trump \u2019 s first 100 months in office. After all, who cares about Bill 101? Especially when, just last month, we witnessed such a marvelous metaphor for the Trump era, so far. While George Washington was busy with the White House Correspondents Association \u2019 s business dinner \u2014 sometimes even \u201d the nerd prom \u201d \u2014 Trump was on a different date in a different city with a very small crowd.",
        "\u201d Is anyone planning to come through here? \u201d That \u2019 s what a Hilton Hotel employee asked one of a dozen photographers along the red carpet at the White House Correspondents \u2019 Association meeting a couple of hours before the convention officially started Friday evening. But, like a mosquito on a sweltering beach, it was the nagging, persistent thought that used to plague attendees throughout the event. The reason : the dread left by the absence of President Donald Trump, who had agreed to spend his 100th day in America rallying with supporters in Pennsylvania.",
        "When Donald Trump was inaugurated as president, he began forcefully laying out a vision for his first 100 days that included full repeal and repeal of the Affordable Care Act, control of immigration from specific states and the lifting of \u201d roadblocks \u201d to let \u201d national projects like the Keystone Pipeline push forward. \u201d \u201d I \u2019 ve asked my leadership team to develop a number of executive actions we can use on Day 1 to restore our confidence and bring back our children, \u201d Trump said in March.",
        "I awoke to the sounds of a mosquito buzzing near my face. It was still dark out, and I could see the stars from my eyes, a rare sight in days when you are in the city. I, however, was at least a few hours from the nearest city. To be honest, I wasn \u2019 t quite certain where I was as I was never given the information or directions, having been transported by a police car from Hyderabad, one of India \u2019 s bustling tech hubs.",

The incident damaged Bangladesh \u2019 s $ 28 billion garment industry, the second largest in the world behind China.",
        "\u201dWhy am I doing this, again?\u201d I\u2019ve asked myself that question several mornings over the past few months as my stomach begins growling, usually after I smell popcorn in my coworker\u2019s office. He\u2019s on a strict 10 a. m. popcorn schedule that coincides with my strict 10 a. m. hunger pang schedule. I am following an intermittent fasting program as part of a clinical trial for people with multiple sclerosis. For the past five months, I have tried to eat only between noon and 8 p. m.",
        "On the week marking President Trump\u2019s 100 days in office, his mood on Twitter was much less positive than it had been in the previous few weeks. A sentiment analysis shows these last few months have been a roller coaster of emotion. Trump\u2019s most negative week by far was his second week in office \u2014 just after he signed his controversial ban on travelers to the U. S. from seven countries, and protests broke out nationwide. His most positive weeks included the confirmation and of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.",
        "Sometimes, even professionally compassionate people get tired. Kristin Laurel, a flight nurse from Waconia, Minn. has worked in trauma units for over two decades. The daily exposure to distressing situations can sometimes result in compassion fatigue. \u201dSome calls get to you, no matter who you are,\u201d she says.

        "A male boss brushes up against his female employee. Off the record, a male politician makes suggestive remarks to a female reporter.

        "Updated at 9:45 p. m. Former first lady Michelle Obama might find some of the latest actions by the Trump administration pretty difficult to stomach.

        "When you talk about the unrest that broke out in Los Angeles 25 years ago after the Rodney King verdict, one thing people usually remember is the looting. People went into stores and just walked out with stuff. Some people stole vital things such as food and baby formula because they didn\u2019t know how long the riots would last. Others stole booze and cigarettes. Still others dared to carry mattresses and giant TVs home on their backs \u2014 and they weren\u2019t stopped by anyone. Gilbert Monterrosa was one of those looters. But, he says he was a reluctant participant.",
        "Jordan Edwards, a high school freshman, was leaving a house party in a Dallas suburb late Saturday night with several friends when police officers arrived outside.

        "In many of today\u2019s newsrooms, women and journalists of color remain a sliver of those producing and reporting stories.

Nationally, Hispanic, black and Asian women make up less than 5 percent of newsroom personnel at traditional print and online news publications, according to 2016 data from the American Society of News Editors.",

        "May Day protests and rallies around the world and across the U. S. are celebrating labor, calling for greater protections and benefits for workers and highlighting the contributions of immigrants.

        "Updated at 9:45 a. m. ET Monday, Congressional leaders have struck a deal to keep the federal government funded through September. The budget negotiations provided Democrats with a rare opportunity for leverage and clout, since Democratic votes will be needed to advance the spending plan through the Senate \u2014 and possibly the House if enough members of the conservative Freedom Caucus vote against it. Democratic leaders took advantage of that, and as a result the final plan does not include any money for one of President Trump\u2019s top priorities: a wall along the U. S. border."
