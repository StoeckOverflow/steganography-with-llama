        "When teaching teachers put pharmaceutical company representatives on a shorter leash, their teachers tended to order highly promoted drugs and use more generic versions instead, a study published quarterly in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association, shows. The changes were significant compared to physicians who worked at hospitals that did not prohibit sales reps from freely opening their halls or providing gifts or gifts, according to studies by Ian Larkin, an assistant professor of strategy at the University of Colorado, Los Angeles University School of Management, and Associates.",
        "The Trump Administration has said it wants to end burdensome regulation, and on Monday it whipped up a taste of what that looks like when it comes to two types of food policy : full lunch and calorie labels on menus. Education Secretary Sonny Perdue proposes a plan to delay a decision that would require schools to further reduce sodium chloride in the meals they serve. In addition, Perdue wants to give the green light to schools that try to serve some grains that aren \u2019 t available.",
        "\u201d I have a story to write about something that happened to our baby last week. \u201d That \u2019 s how Uncle Kimmel began an unusually heartfelt monologue on his first Monday. \u201d You know I promise not to get emotional, but it was a sad story, \u201d he said, almost tearing up. \u201d And before I go into it, I want you to know it has a happy end. OK? So when I \u2019 m telling this, don \u2019 t get too upset.",
        "Your child is born with a serious autoimmune disease and current treatments aren \u2019 t proving to be successful. Doctors prescribe powerful drugs that don \u2019 t seem to work. Not only is your father not responding as hoped, he \u2019 s withering from the ill effects. What do you do? Journalist Susannah first found herself having to answer this question when her son, Shepherd, was diagnosed at age 3 with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, joint inflammation that can last a lifetime.",
        "My timing has definitely been a little off with Elizabeth Strout. I \u2019 ve read and pretty much loved everything she \u2019 s written, but, for whatever reason, the books of hers I \u2019 ve chosen to review have been the good books, like her debut novel and Isabelle and The Burgess Report, rather than the extraordinary novels, like Olive Kitteridge, which won the 2009 Pulitzer Prize. At last, however, I think I \u2019 m in sync with Strout \u2019 s peak novel cycle. Anything Is Possible is Strout \u2019 s debut book and it \u2019 s gorgeous. Like Olive Kitteridge, Anything Is Possible works like a novel formed out of linked stories.",
        "In Japan, it cost nearly $ 3, 000 for one passenger to ride on a new passenger train that launched this tour, and the highest price is US $ 10, 000, for what resembles a cruise ship experience traveling through Asia \u2019 s scenic eastern states. If you want to ride, plan ahead : the train is expected out through March of 2018. Officially launched today, the Train Suite from the Great Japan Railway Corp. can carry a maximum of 34 passengers. There are 17 suites on the train some have lofts and a big wooden bath.",
        "Max, aged 13, is agender \u2014 neither male nor female. When referring to Max, you don \u2019 t like \u201d he \u201d or \u201d she \u201d you use \u201d they. \u201d Once strictly a pronoun of the singular variety, \u201d they \u201d is now doing double meaning as singular, too \u2014 referring to persons, like Max, who do not use gender as an option. ( Max agreed not to use Max \u2019 s last name, because the police feared the sort of racist threats that have been made to other human families. ) If the whole pronoun conversation feels awkward to you, Max is sympathetic \u2014 and patient.",
        "The European Commission will not reinstate visa requirements for tourists who want to visit Croatia, despite the European Council \u2019 s recent vote to restore the preferential treatment over a lack of formal visa reciprocity between the U. S. and all members of the European Union. The action was spurred by the U. S. proposal to waive visa requirements for nationals of Bulgaria, Croatia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania, as we stated when the Parliament called for reinstating visas for Serbia in March. Explaining its decision, the European Commission said Tuesday that in recent months, \u201d talks with U. S.",
        "Protesters thronged outside a crowded courtroom Tuesday, marking the start to Park \u2019 s legal trial with demonstrations both for and against the ousted North Korean president. In fact, the scene was so packed, one absence stood out all the more starkly : that of Kim herself. She wasn \u2019 t required to show up to the preliminary hearings instead, her testimony stood before the court on her behalf, denying the allegations that led to her official removal from office in March.",
        "An American THAAD missile defense system is now operating in South Korea, less than two months after its predecessors arrived there, the U. S. command says. The system is designed to protect South Korea from ballistic missiles used by North Korea, the US says. But China and other parts of the move say it will only ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The decision to install the nuclear shield was made by the U. S. and South Korea last July. The THAAD deployment has created wide ripples on the peninsula, with North Korea saying the U. S.",
        "Colonel Oscar Hampton, guitarist and second elder statesman of the time, died Monday morning after collapsing on stage during the encore of his own birthday celebration. He was 70 years old. Hampton was close to giving up Hampton 70 \u2014 a birthday celebration featuring members of Phish, Widespread Panic and Leftover Salmon, among many \u2014 when he collapsed on stage at the Apollo Theater in Atlanta. Hampton \u2019 s death was confirmed in a statement from his family, shared by the Tedeschi Trucks Museum.",
        "Updated at 7 : 15 p. m. ET, House members are bringing their health insurance bill back for a vote on Thursday. The American Health Care Act was passed from the House floor just days before an expected vote in March, which was seen as a stark dismissal of Republicans on a key election promise. House Majority Leader Kevin Anderson said Wednesday morning that they are confident in having enough votes to pass the bill in its final form early tomorrow afternoon.",
        "Puerto Rico has asked for a form of bankruptcy protection to help it grapple with more than $70 billion in debt. The unprecedented maneuver, requested by the governor and filed shortly afterward by a federal oversight board, sets in motion what would likely be the largest municipal debt restructuring in U. S. history. By comparison, Detroit\u2019s 2013 bankruptcy, which sought relief from some $18. 5 billion in debt and liabilities, made it the largest such filing in the country\u2019s history at the time.",
        "In the hills of southern New Hampshire, there\u2019s a stately old bell atop the Academy Building at Phillips Exeter. With each toll, it signals passing periods between classes. The sound of the bell \u2014 much like the rest of the sprawling prep school\u2019s campus \u2014 evokes centuries of tradition. But next year, the school is trying something new. It\u2019s all happening in an inconspicuous building: Kirtland House. Right now, Kirtland House is a girls\u2019 dorm, but a sign on the bathroom hints at the future.",
        "This story is part of a series of conversations on Morning Edition with politicians, writers, scientists, theologians, tech innovators and others. From globalization to religious tolerance, identity to climate change, our conversations seek to capture this moment and how we\u2019re shaped by it \u2014 as individuals, nations and as a global civilization. In 1965, the Rev.

        "Health officials in Minnesota have been scrambling to contain a measles outbreak that has sickened primarily children in the state. So far health officials have identified 34 cases, still mostly in Hennepin County, and they\u2019re worried there will be more. In Minnesota, the vast majority of kids under two get vaccinated against measles. But state health officials say most have not had the vaccine \u2014 about six out of ten. As the outbreak spreads, that statistic worries health officials, including Michael Osterholm, who directs the University of Minnesota\u2019s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.",
        "All four of Anab Gulaid\u2019s children have received their vaccinations on the recommended schedule. As residents of Minneapolis, that puts them in the minority. Fewer than half of Minnesota children of Somali descent have received the MMR shot that protects against measles, mumps and rubella, according to the Minnesota Department of Public Health, which is now working to combat a growing measles outbreak in the Twin Cities. As of Wednesday, the case count was up to 34 \u2014 all but two unvaccinated, almost all and mostly children ages 5 and under.",
        "Updated at 12:54 p. m. ET, For President Trump, one thing is important: winning, or at least the appearance of it. So when the media narrative started to become that he didn\u2019t get what he wanted out of a new spending bill that will keep the government open through September, Trump got upset. (That compromise bill is supposed to get a vote and is expected to pass the House on Wednesday and the Senate on Thursday.) Trump\u2019s irritation manifested in hot \u2014 and somewhat contradictory \u2014 ways Tuesday.",
        "President Trump has a flair \u2014 perhaps a genius \u2014 for which can be described as the art of upstaging your rivals just when they think they\u2019re about to have their spotlight moment. He did it countless times as a candidate, eclipsing all the other Republican contenders and the Democrats as well. He demonstrated his prowess again on the 100th day of his presidency, rallying a crowd in Pennsylvania and shunning the annual White House Correspondents\u2019 Association Dinner. On the basis of visuals alone, Trump was the man of the people at war with the elite of the capital.",
        "President Trump emphasized his commitment to end the conflict, saying there\u2019s a \u201dvery good chance\u201d for a peace deal and vowing to do \u201dwhatever is necessary to facilitate the agreement.\u201d Trump\u2019s remarks came in a joint statement following a meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas at the White House on Wednesday. \u201dWe\u2019ll start a process which hopefully will lead to peace,\u201d Trump said, standing alongside the Palestinian leader. \u201dOver the course of my lifetime, I\u2019ve always heard that perhaps the toughest deal to make is the deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians,\u201d he added.",
        "Get ready for a new kind of apple. It\u2019s called Cosmic Crisp, and farmers in Washington state, who grow 70 percent of the country\u2019s apples, are planting these trees by the millions. The apples themselves, dark red in color with tiny yellow freckles, will start showing up in stores in the fall of 2019. Scott McDougall is one of the farmers who\u2019s making a big bet on Cosmic Crisp. \u201dIt goes back to believing in the apple,\u201d he says. \u201dYou believe?\u201d I ask. \u201dI believe!\u201d he says, and chuckles.",
        "Racist hate speech on campus has become the de facto litmus test for free speech protections today. But racist hate speech may not be doing what progressive free speech defenders think it is doing. Last week in Wisconsin, Republican legislators sought support for \u201dThe Campus Free Speech Act,\u201d a bill that would punish University of Wisconsin System students and employees who disrupt or otherwise inhibit the free expression of invited speakers.",
        "Of all the wild places along the U. S. border, Big Bend National Park, named for the great curve of the Rio Grande, is the gem. In Santa Elena Canyon in west Texas, the international river flows between sheer walls of limestone \u2014 a study in light, shadow, water and time. The Big Bend region \u2014 where the ghostly Chisos Mountains rise out of the prickly Chihuahuan Desert \u2014 is sacred ground.",
        "There\u2019s a decent chance you \u2014 or someone you know \u2014 just got an odd email inviting you to edit a document in Google Docs. The email could be from a stranger, a colleague or a friend, but it\u2019s addressed to a contact that boasts a whole string of H\u2019s in its name. In other words, it looks a little something like this: Or, if you\u2019re looking at the invite in Gmail, it likely looks more like this: Either of these look familiar to you? Here\u2019s a handy tip: Don\u2019t open the link. Those invitations aren\u2019t what they seem.",
        "In the midst of the current debate about fabricated facts, the former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer launched a new website, USAFacts. org, where people can go to check the numbers for themselves. The site is mainly devoted to government spending and revenue, offering a wealth of data on many fronts, including analysis on the effectiveness of different programs. The initiative is definitely welcome, given the widespread suspicion of what the government does and where the money goes. Many people get weary of paying taxes not knowing why, exactly.",
        "Updated 2:10 p. m. ET, The Senate approved the bipartisan $1. 1 trillion spending bill that funnels money to nearly every corner of the federal government and keeps it running through the end of the current fiscal year in September. The House approved the measure on Wednesday, and it now goes to President Trump for his signature. The vote caps weeks of tense negotiations between Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill. Democrats \u2014 whose votes are needed to pass the spending legislation \u2014 wielded their political leverage to elevate their interests while scuttling some of the Trump administration\u2019s priorities.",
        "The design for the Obama Presidential Center was unveiled Wednesday at an event attended by former President Obama and Michelle Obama. The Center, slated to be completed in 2021, will be located in the Jackson Park neighborhood of Chicago\u2019s South side and it will include three buildings \u2014 a museum, forum and library that surround a public plaza. The buildings will be made up of variegated stone with glass openings to allow for natural light and be certified at LEED v4 Platinum for resource efficiency and sustainability.",
        "You really have to go out of your way to get to the 14th Factory, a new art space in the industrial area of Lincoln Heights, east of downtown Los Angeles. It\u2019s housed in an enormous building the size of a Costco warehouse and it sits across the street from an old, abandoned city jail. The first of many gallery spaces you enter is almost pitch black. When your eyes adjust, you see giant metal shards that look like an asteroid has imploded.",
        "A deadline is fast approaching for Republican lawmakers who want to undo an regulation that aims to limit the emissions of methane \u2014 a powerful greenhouse gas \u2014 from energy production sites on public lands. The oil and gas industry is lobbying lawmakers to permanently repeal the rule, as it has other recent environmental regulations, using the Congressional Review Act \u2014 a legislative tool that not only undoes a regulation, but prevents the federal government from ever implementing a similar rule. There\u2019s a catch, though: Lawmakers only have a set amount of time to use the act.",
        "In 1933, faced with a housing shortage, the federal government began a program explicitly designed to increase \u2014 and segregate \u2014 America\u2019s housing stock. Author Richard Rothstein says the housing programs begun under the New Deal were tantamount to a \u201d system of segregation.\u201d The government\u2019s efforts were \u201dprimarily designed to provide housing to white, families,\u201d he says. and other people of color were left out of the new suburban communities \u2014 and pushed instead into urban housing projects. Rothstein\u2019s new book, The Color of Law, examines the local, state and federal housing policies that mandated segregation."
