        "When Ruthanna Emrys first saw H. P. Lovecraft \u2019 s origin story \u201d The Shadow Over Innsmouth, \u201d she instantly knew the basics : It \u2019 s about a creepy New England harbor city populated by strange, vampires who turn out to be monstrous, sacrificing lives to their dark gods under the sun. \u201d But I was shocked when the story started with a government raid that sends the people to concentration camps, \u201d Emrys tells me in an email conversation.",
        "One year ago around this event, thousands of people seeking a luxurious island reprieve were booked for a trip to Exuma Island in the Caribbean to attend the Fyre Festival. In the months since, two cases seeking class C certification against the organizers of the first event \u2014 and the models that produced it \u2014 have been filed. Until today, when a judge joined them.",

        "The Justice Department decided not to charge the people involved last April in the fatal shooting of a gay man, Alton Sterling. The decision is being met with anger by citizens who say prosecutors are too deferential toward cops \u2014 and are too quick to cut them off. That notion has been front and centre since the 2014 protests in Nashville, Mo. that followed the killing of Michael Brown. Here are several questions and answers you should expect about whether that complaint is significant : 1. Is the Justice Department \u2019 s explanation not to prosecute the Baton Rouge, Miss. officers surprising?",
        "North Korea now has its own version of Spam in grocery shops. In the capital, Pyongyang, at least, still has a smartphone \u2014 or two. These are some of the things journalist Jean Lee didn \u2019 t notice five years earlier when she opened the Associated Press bureau in the capital of the impoverished and backward country. Now a global consultant at the Wilson Center, Lee was invited to travel to South Korea this week to attend a medical conference in Pyongyang and gather a team of surgeons. With the backdrop of improving relations between North Korea and the U. S.",
        "In the summer of 2011, freelance journalist Suki Kim found a job teaching Journalism at the elite, Pyongyang University of Arts and Technology in the North Korea capital. Kim, who was born in South Korea and immigrated with her family to the U. S. at age 13, is a fluent Korean speaker and secretly took classes during her six months at the University in Pyongyang. This formed the basis for her second book, Without You, There Is No World. Though the university is meant for the privileged few, the students, including all North Koreans, are easily controlled.",
        "On college campuses, outrage over provocative speakers sometimes turns violent. It \u2019 s always a pattern on campuses around the country. A speaker is mocked, often by a conservative minority group. Other students insult the speaker, and maybe they agree. If the speech happens, the student is heckled. Sometimes there \u2019 s violence. In other words \u2014 as with conservative commentator Chris Coulter at the University of California, Berkeley last week \u2014 the discussion is called off. Now, a handful of countries, including Illinois, Utah, Colorado and Arizona, have drafted or introduced legislation trying to prevent these incidents from happening.",
        "The second Democrat nominated by President Bush to serve as secretary of the cabinet announced today he was eliminated from the process. Tennessee state Sen. Mark Warner, a former Army special operations officer, stated \u201d false and misleading information against me \u201d in a statement that said his views had become a \u201d distraction \u201d and so he stated he should not take it forward. \u201d Tragically, my style of public service and my personal beliefs have been mischaracterized and attacked by a few on the other end of the aisle for political reasons, \u201d he said.",
        "Updated at 8 : 15 p. m. ET, In an email to representatives in the Office of National Drug Control Policy, CIA Director Richard Baum received some news he described as \u201d very discouraging for our organization \u2019 s effort to address child abuse. \u201d A draft paper from the White House executive office, obtained by NASA, proposes nearly zeroing out support for the ONDCP and fully eliminating several programs involved in handling the opioid crisis. Leaked documents provide about a 94 percent overall target.",
        "Warning : This book contains graphic pictures and video. While President Manuel Maduro has set the gears in preparing for a new Venezuelan law, the confusion and violence that has filled city streets for more than a week only appears to be deepening. The tumult continued apace this morning, opening Monday with Maduro \u2019 s calling for a new law of the republic and culminating with a women \u2019 s march \u2014 a gathering in the capital downtown to protest the president \u2019 s proposed changes.",
        "Delta is the second airline to face fallout from an explosion, after a family that was forced off an airline flight from Maui to California saw video that saw the parents say agents would put the parents in danger and place their children in foster care. The airline is seeking compensation and an apology to John Schear and his family after Schear posted the video on YouTube Wednesday. In it, Schear and family members argue over whether the seat he bought for his family could instead be replaced by his.",
        "A Chinese man stands on a pedestal surrounded by a harbor as a cartoon imitation of the Statue of Liberty. His clothes are tattered, his hair is in a long, thin tail, his eyes squint. The words \u201ddiseases,\u201d \u201dfilth,\u201d \u201dimmorality,\u201d and \u201druin to white labor\u201d float around his head. This man is the center of an iconic image from 1881 called \u201dA Statue for Our Harbor,\u201d made by the cartoonist George Frederick Keller.",
        "Back in 2014, Laura Poitras brought out Citizenfour, her documentary about Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations of the NSA\u2019s illegal surveillance program. Unfolding like a thriller, the film knew exactly what it was about \u2014 Snowden\u2019s heroism, the evils of clandestine government snooping and the virtues of making such hidden programs known. Poitras clearly expected to make a similar kind of movie when she started shooting Risk, her new film about Julian Assange, the Australian founder of WikiLeaks whose way of classified documents radically changed journalism.",
        "Soccer star Sulley Muntari finally got fed up. He\u2019s a midfielder from Ghana who plays for the Italian team Pescara. Last Sunday in a match against Cagliari in Sardinia, a bunch of spectators taunted him with racist chants. He reportedly shouted, \u201dThis is my color\u201d and went to the referee to ask that the game be halted. Instead, he got a yellow card. The card means he was booked for dissent, a punishment doled out to players who touch or verbally abuse officials.",
        "A lot of the anger over federal public land in rural Utah today can be traced back to a windy, gray day in Arizona in September 1996. At the Grand Canyon, President Bill Clinton formally designated the Grand National Monument in Utah, more than 100 miles away. \u201dOn this remarkable site, God\u2019s handiwork is everywhere in the natural beauty of the Escalante Canyons,\u201d he said. But Clinton didn\u2019t set foot in Utah. The planning for the monument was largely done in secret, and state leaders had little warning it was coming.",
        "If you were feeling blue after Crayola\u2019s March announcement that the company would be retiring the bright yellow hue, Dandelion, you\u2019ll soon have a new blue crayon to color in your tears with. The company announced in March that a member of the blue family would take Dandelion\u2019s spot, but the specifics were lacking, until now. On Friday, Crayola announced that the new blue is inspired by the YInMn blue pigment. Not familiar with YInMn? Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s pretty new to the color scene.",
        "For the second time in less than two weeks, the State Department has hit the \u201ddelete\u201d button after complaints that it was promoting Trump family business endeavors. This time, the State Department deleted a retweet of a post by President Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump. The Office of Global Women\u2019s Issues, a small at the State Department, used its official Twitter account to retweet an Ivanka Trump tweet touting her new book, Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success.

        "The U. K. held its local elections Thursday, and a political party won its first seat. This party is comprised of just one woman, named Sally Cogley. And it has just one issue: rubbish. In Thursday\u2019s vote to fill three Irvine Valley places on East Ayrshire Council, Cogley came in second after the Scottish National Party candidate, enough to win a seat.",
        "Fans throwing back whiskey while listening to Chris Stapleton, or hollering in delight at his thrilling shows, might be surprised to learn that country\u2019s woolly is actually kind of a nerd. He spends time online bidding on old guitar pedals so he can replicate the sounds on his favorite Staple Singers albums, and thinks a great date with his wife, Morgane, is a trip to a record store to scour the dollar bins.",
        "As a songwriter in Nashville, Chris Stapleton has written hits for Kenny Chesney, George Strait and Darius Rucker. As a singer, he once led the bluegrass band The SteelDrivers, and more recently stepped into the solo spotlight with Traveller, his debut album. It\u2019s the kind of country record that gets better the more you wear it in: When NPR Music named it one of our favorite albums of the first half of 2015, critic Ann Powers compared it to a \u201dsoft denim jacket . ..",
        "years ago, the 27th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution was ratified \u2014 nearly two centuries after it was written. The improbable story of how that happened starts with the Founding Fathers themselves and winds up at the University of Texas. And it\u2019s a heartening reminder of the power of individuals to make real change. Let\u2019s back up to 1982. A college sophomore named Gregory Watson was taking a government class at UT Austin. For the class, he had to write a paper about a governmental process.",
        "It was in a school in the South Bronx a few weeks ago that I first heard about the Netflix series 13 Reasons Why. The TV show, released at the end of March and based on a young adult novel, depicts a teenager who kills herself. She experiences sexual assault, cyberbullying and inadequate responses from adults, and she leaves messages for the classmates and others whom she holds responsible for her suicide. Educators, parents and school counselors are raising the alarm that the show glamorizes risky behaviors and could even lead to copycat deaths.",
        "If you\u2019re reading this from Australia, kudos! You\u2019ve already had the two new LCD Soundsystem tracks, announced Thursday, since midnight down under. Everyone else, now is your time. With a bass line that hits your stomach, \u201dCall The Police\u201d finds James Murphy in a motorik mood by way of The Cure and New Order. \u201dAmerican Dream\u201d is a wobbly ballad the clops along in waltz time. Now go dance and sob accordingly.",
        "Sometimes the toughest interview questions come from the most surprising places. Isaiah Fredericks and his brother, Josiah, put their dad, Kevin, in the interview hot seat during a visit to StoryCorps. They started out with the basics: when and where Kevin was born. \u201dI was born in El Paso, Texas, in 1983 on my grandmother Ruthie\u2019s bed,\u201d Kevin said. Isaiah didn\u2019t know this but admitted it was an interesting piece of information. But then his brother, Josiah, asked their dad, \u201dHow do you describe yourself as a child?",

Democrats who lost the battle are still convinced they may win the political war. As the Republicans reached a majority for the bill, Democrats on the House floor began chanting, \u201dNa, na, na, na . .. hey, hey, hey . .. goodbye.\u201d They say Republicans could lose their seats for supporting a bill that could cause so much disruption in voters\u2019 health care.",
        "As soon as the House approved the GOP health care bill on Thursday, Democrats were working on using it against Republicans in next year\u2019s midterm elections. \u201dThey have this vote tattooed on them.

        "The first time I laid eyes on Michelangelo\u2019s Piet\u00e0 in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica at the Vatican, I let out a sob. I don\u2019t know why. I was surrounded by a dense crowd of tourists the sculpture was set back behind a thick Plexiglas panel. Whatever view I was able to enjoy was punctuated by the lights of cameras reflected in the intervening panel.",
        "This year, Free Comic Book Day turns sixteen years old. The good news: It can drive itself to swim practice now! The bad news: When you ask it to drive its younger siblings Record Store Day and Independent Bookstore Day to Gymboree it\u2019ll give you THAT LOOK IT GETS and spend the rest of the day sulking. Here\u2019s the gist: Walk into a comic shop this Saturday, May 6, and you\u2019ll get some free comic books.

        "The skies cleared just in time for Derby fans to trade out their ponchos for flamboyant hats when the jockeys assumed their posts. But intermittent rains posed a muddy challenge for the field at Churchill Downs racetrack on Saturday. In the end though, Always Dreaming, ridden by jockey John Velazquez, was able to pull ahead of Lookin at Lee in the slop, to win the 143rd Kentucky Derby. The Battle of Midway finished third.
