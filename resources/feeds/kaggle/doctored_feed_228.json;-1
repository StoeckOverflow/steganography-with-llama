        "There \u2019 s more grim reporting about inequality in America. New research documents huge disparities in the life spans of people depending on where they live. And those differences appear to be widening, according to the research. Data is by country, includes both sexes, and is by ethnicity. \u201d It \u2019 s dramatic, \u201d says Richard Murray, who heads the Center for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. He helped lead the analysis, published widely in JAMA Internal Medicine. Health experts have long insisted that Americans living in different parts of the country tended to have different life histories.",
        ", A man called Eddie threads through the night in Cambridge, Mass. He \u2019 s asking for a sandwich shop, the last stop on a tour of Massachusetts bathrooms. \u201d I know all the bathrooms that I can and can \u2019 t get comfortable in, \u201d says Eddie, 39, sitting in front of the shop \u2019 s large glass windows, through which we can find a bathroom door. Eddie, whose last bathroom we \u2019 re not including because he uses illegal drugs, knows which restrooms along busy Massachusetts places he can enter, at what hours and for how long.",
        "Updated at 7 p. m. ET, A panel of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit heard arguments on appeals over President Trump \u2019 s Iraq travel ban, with prosecutors repeatedly questioning the judge \u2019 s lawyer in the case about Trump \u2019 s campaign call \u201d for a temporary and total shutdown \u201d of Muslims across the country. The president \u2019 s controversial executive order restricting immigration from a handful of countries sparked chaos at airports across the country in January. Many judges stepped in to oppose the order, partly because it allowed legal permanent aliens, who have rights under the U. S. constitution.",
        "South Africa was filled with drama in 1993. Politics raged as the white president, J. W. de Klerk, met with black leader Nelson Mandela to end apartheid. Amid this tragedy, de Klerk appeared on CNN one night and delivered a startling announcement : South Africa secretly owned six nuclear submarines, but had dismantled them and shut down the last, he said.",
        "Sinclair Broadcast Group, based outside Baltimore, announced Monday it had struck a $ 3. 9 billion deal to obtain dozens of existing television stations by purchasing Tribune Media. The transaction, seen as likely to gain approval of federal regulators with only modest concessions, would further propel competition in the industry. It would also offer a greater price for one of the nation \u2019 s most famous media companies. Although little known in traditional media centers, Sinclair \u2019 s holdings are vast.",
        "In 1995, NPR \u2019 s All Things Considered invited tech entrepreneur Walt Mossberg on to the show to take on an increasingly popular theme : the World Wide Web. Mossberg shared a tool that wanted to make sense of a disorganized and slow Internet, a website called Yahoo. At the time, Yahoo was a directory service for individuals online, he explained.

        "Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari has headed to London for \u201d personal consultation with his doctors \u201d \u2014 claims his administration has not elaborated on what, precisely, his appointment will be addressing. The visit begins as concerns simmer over the president \u2019 s administration, which has attracted speculation as he misses cabinet meetings and made infrequent public appearances. \u201d The direction of the President \u2019 s stay in London will be determined by the doctors, \u201d Femi Adesina, the president \u2019 s special adviser on finance and publicity, announced on Friday on Sunday.",

It \u2019 s called Sea Grant \u2014 part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \u2014 and President Donald Trump \u201d s proposed program for next year would eliminate it. Sea conservation funds support more than 800 universities around the country.

There \u2019 s a white fence sticking up from the ground. The ubiquitous scent of suburbia \u2014 the septic tank \u2014 lies nearby.",
        "Another case, another study undercutting the mysteries surrounding the Italian violin maker Antonio Stradivari. Since the early 20th century, composers and instrument experts have been attempting to figure out what, if anything, made the violins he made sound better. Dedicated NPR listeners and violin enthusiasts may begin a few years ago when a group led by the French acoustics specialist Claudia Fritz made a study showing that blindfolded American violinists could not tell the difference between a Old Italian instrument ( they tested instruments made by both Stradivari and Guarneri ) and a new violin.",
        "Updated at 5 : 10 p. m. ET, Syria \u2019 s interior minister said also that the government supports a similar deal to create \u201d countries, \u201d though it does not support the ability of international forces to protect them. But it remains to be seen whether this latest international effort will be any different than numerous other moves that have thus far worked to end the conflict. Later Monday, U. N. mediator Staffan de Mistura said he is convening a new round of talks in Madrid between the Syrian government and Libya on May 16.",
        "James Patterson has a long history of fiction. Of his dozens of books, the blockbuster American writer has written at least 50 \u2014 yes, \u2014 with the name of a emblazoned on the spine. Still, it \u2019 s fair to say none of them has the resume of the real novice he \u2019 s teaming up with now : former President Bill Clinton. \u201d Working with Bill Clinton has been the highlight of my work, and having access to his experience has also informed the writing of this novel, \u201d Patterson said in a book released by publisher Penguin Random House.",

        "This is part of a series of conversations on Morning Edition with politicians, writers, scientists, theologians, tech innovators and others. We\u2019re asking, \u201dHow did we get here \u2014 and where are we headed?\u201d Out of those answers, we\u2019ll help capture this moment and how we\u2019re shaped by it, as individuals, nations and as a global civilization. Condoleezza Rice\u2019s new book, Democracy: Stories from the Long Road to Freedom, is a endorsement of overseas engagement and democracy building. It comes at a time of widespread distrust of government and institutions.",
        "Growing up in Brooklyn with a mother from the South and father from Senegal, Gabourey Sidibe spent much of her youth feeling anxious. She was mocked for being and for being overweight, and she worried she would never find her true calling. As a young woman, Sidibe struggled to find work and ultimately took a job as a phone sex operator where the rule of business was to sound \u201d100 percent white.\u201d Then, when she was 24, she auditioned for the role that would change her life.",
        "The Air Force\u2019s experimental space plane announced the end of its nearly mission by creating a sonic boom on Sunday that surprised residents along Florida\u2019s Space Coast.

        "\u201dThis song is called \u2019You Never Loved Me\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s another cheery, optimistic number,\u201d says Aimee Mann, introducing the second of four songs in this Tiny Desk Concert. She has been writing songs on the human condition \u2014 more often than not with a strong sense of humor to underpin the inevitable melancholy \u2014 as far back as the \u201980s, when she was the singer and bassist in Boston\u2019s The Young Snakes.

        "Updated at 9:22 p. m. ET, The president has fired FBI Director James Comey, who was overseeing an investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 elections and possible ties to the Trump campaign and top aides. The White House pointed to Comey\u2019s handling of the probe into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server while secretary of state as the reason for his dismissal.",
        "Updated at 11:00 p. m. ET, For months, Democrats in Congress have criticized and questioned FBI Director James Comey about his handling of last year\u2019s investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server. Still, they\u2019ve met President Trump\u2019s surprising Tuesday evening decision to fire Comey with outrage. The White House and the Justice Department cited Comey\u2019s ineffective leadership, but the general gist of Democratic reaction: Trump\u2019s decision should be viewed not in light of Comey\u2019s past missteps but instead in the context of the FBI\u2019s ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the U. S.",
        "On the south side of Dallas, Nena Eldridge lives in a sparse but spotless bungalow on a dusty lot. At $550 each month, her rent is just about the cheapest she could find in the city. After an injury left her unable to work, the only income she receives is a $780 monthly disability check. So she has to make tough financial choices, like living without running water. Every day, she fills bottles with water from a neighbor\u2019s house and takes them home. She washes her hands with water heated in an electric slow cooker.",
        "Do black and white children who live in assisted or subsidized housing experience different life outcomes? That question was at the center of a new study by Sandra Newman and C. Scott Holupka, two researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. They combed through federal data on households in public housing or those that received housing vouchers from the 1970s through the first decade of the 2000s. What the pair found was neither straightforward nor surprising.",
        "In an effort to retake ISIS\u2019 last major stronghold, President Trump has approved arming Kurdish forces in Syria despite opposition from Turkey. The U. S. will supply the Kurdish elements of the Syrian Democratic Forces \u201das necessary,\u201d Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said in a statement Tuesday.

        "The bones of a humanlike creature have puzzled scientists ever since they were found in a South African cave in 2013. Homo naledi is primitive in some ways, with a small brain and other physical features reminiscent of our early ancestors. But it also walked upright, and had hands that may have been capable of making tools. This perplexing combination of features raised questions about when the animal walked the Earth. But in new research published Tuesday in eLife, scientists have come to the conclusion that it lived between 335, 000 and 236, 000 years ago.",
        "On Tuesday, paleoanthropologists led by Paul Dirks at James Cook University revealed in the journal eLife that Homo naledi, a hominin found in South Africa, lived \u2014 and may have cared for their dead in careful, intentional ways \u2014 as recently as 236, 000 years ago. This was, to put it mildly, a surprise. Homo naledi shows an intriguing mix of characteristics \u2014 a small brain, curved fingers (apparently an adaptation related to ) and certain joints but more teeth, hands (except for the finger curvature) legs, and feet.",
        "Town hall meetings got loud for some Republican members of Congress this week, as they defended the passage of the American Health Care Act by the House of Representatives.

        "Lawmakers in the House of Representatives are back in their home districts for a recess this week. After seeing the reception some of their colleagues got in previous town meetings following the election of Donald Trump, most House Republicans are skipping them. But a handful are diving in headfirst. On Monday night, a few days after voting in favor of the House bill to repeal and replace major parts of the Affordable Care Act, Rep. Elise Stefanik, 32, from Northern New York, held a town hall at a public television station.",
        "Companies that provide cell phone service are constantly racing to provide the most reliable signal. In Wisconsin, one of the providers has turned to a surprising option to get the job done: draft horses. The horses are helping U. S. Cellular upgrade equipment on about 200 cell towers in Wisconsin, some of which are served by access roads. \u201dWe call them roads.

        "On April 28, the magazine LensCulture posted a photo of what appeared to be a man raping a girl who looks like a young teenager. The magazine \u2014 which has nearly a million Facebook followers \u2014 was using the photo to promote a competition in partnership with Magnum Photos, which cost $60 to enter 10 photos. \u201dDon\u2019t miss out!\u201d the post said, a few sentences above the photo.

        "It was like two different hearings in one. Democrats quizzed former Obama administration officials on Russia, how former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn had been \u201dcompromised\u201d and how the White House officials conducted themselves when confronted with the information. Republicans wanted to know how the information got out in the first place. It was striking watching the two distinct focuses on a topic \u2014 national security \u2014 that shouldn\u2019t be so hotly partisan. And the data bear out the different approaches.",
        "The Federal Communications Commission\u2019s public commenting system experienced delays Sunday night. That was the same night comedian John Oliver did a segment about net neutrality on his HBO show, Last Week Tonight and encouraged viewers to file comments on the FCC\u2019s website. On Monday, the FCC said in a statement that the delay of service was not related to an overwhelming number of people filing comments.

        "Meet Beibeilong sinensis, the most recently identified dinosaur species. The name means \u201dbaby dragon from China.\u201d The dinosaur had massive feathered wings and a birdlike skull. It probably looked most like a cassowary, flightless birds slightly smaller than an ostrich. But the Beibeilong was much bigger than any currently living bird, according to a study published in Nature Communications. Based on comparisons with close relatives, the birdlike dinosaur probably weighed about 3 tons and could grow up to 26 feet long. In 1993, farmers in China found a Beibeilong embryo and eggs in Henan province."
