        "Old specimens found in the Australian Outback have some weighty questions, scientists say : They hint at the environment in which life on Earth originated and suggest a way to search for life on earth. Scientists in Australia believe they have found biological evidence of life in rocks that would show the presence of a warm spring, lending weight to a theory that the earliest life on Earth might have existed in freshwater hot springs on land rather than in hydrothermal vents.",

But in reality, the President may well have just thrown the can down the road until September, when both sides may be spoiling for a fight amid the specter of a government shutdown. The spending cuts didn \u2019 t give President Clinton or congressional Republicans and Democrats everything they wanted.

        "Firearms safety is key for people who use weapons at work or for recreational shooting. But one risk has been little acknowledged: Lead dust exposure. In a standard bullet, a solid lead core wrapped in a copper jacket sits atop a stack of gunpowder and lead primer. When the gun fires, the primer ignites, the gunpowder lights, and some of the lead on the bullet boils. When the casing snaps out of the ejection port, lead particles trail behind it. As the bullet hurtles down the barrel of the gun, a shower of lead particles follows.",
