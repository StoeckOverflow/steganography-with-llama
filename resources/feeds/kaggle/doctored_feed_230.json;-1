        "This was not exactly the end VG Media had hoped for. The consortium of German publishers had attacked Google, arguing that the software giant has infringed on copyright protections by using snippets of the publishers \u2019 articles in search results. Those snippets, according to VG Media, hurt the publishers \u2019 product line by sating potential customers \u2019 curiosity and violated a 2013 copyright law that requires registration for those snippets of text. Yet on Tuesday a Berlin court addressed some concerns with the law itself often known in English as the Ancillary Case for Press Publishers.",
        "Updated at 1 : 45 p. m. ET, Betsy DeVos fought through waves of boos and shouted things during her commencement speech at Harvard on Wednesday, delivering a celebratory toast with what seemed at times to be laughter. In the week and a half since the historically black university announced DeVos would be attending the address, protest petitions collecting thousands of signatures and protests for the school president \u2019 s office have cropped up \u2014 as NPR \u2019 s Anya Kamenetz finds out here. The reaction to the speech itself \u2014 which you can find below \u2014 was often no different.",
        "Fifty thousand signatures on protest petitions. Calls on the leadership of the university to resign. Voices on Twitter saying they \u2019 re mailing back their degrees. It \u2019 s probably not what the Head of University was expecting when they met their speaker for today \u2019 s commencement ceremony. But Education Commissioner Betsy DeVos seems to find a unique level of confidence almost everywhere she goes. And that \u2019 s especially true when it comes to historically black people like.",
        "In a rare occurrence for environmentalists under President Trump, the administration rejected efforts to roll back an rule regarding methane emissions from energy extraction sites on federal land.

        "The idea of shelters isn \u2019 t new. But today Amazon announced that a new facility it plans to construct in Seattle will feature a decidedly uncommon location : its own offices, and a homeless center with space for 65 families. The organization said it will donate more than 47, 000 square feet of space, or about half of the new building, to Mary \u2019 s Place, which operates four family shelters. Last year, Amazon bought Mary \u2019 s Place to put up a shelter inside a nearby Travelodge it owns.",
        "The city of Milwaukee and the family of a black man with schizophrenia who was shot dead by a white officer have reached a new $ 2. 3 million settlement settlement, three years after his arrest. \u201d Officer Christopher Manney previously faced criminal charges, but was fired from the police force for failing to follow instructions, \u201d LaToya Dennis of member station WUWM tells our Newscast unit. She added that the settlement still requires the approval of the Milwaukee Common Council.

        "Rakesh Satyal \u2019 s new book checks off a lot of stereotypes, but its charm lies in the way that it wears all of it various characteristics so lightly. This is an immigration study, a story and something of an eerie story about a timid woman starting to roar. Yet, there \u2019 s nothing preachy or predictable about Satyal \u2019 s novel however, the most cumbersome thing about it is its title, which I \u2019 ve delayed saying for as long as possible. It \u2019 s called No One Can Pronounce My name, which sounds aggrieved when, instead, this is one that invites readers to be curious.",
        "Growing up, Susan Soloway had a hard time talking to women as they were portrayed on television. Soloway would watch The Love Boat or Fantasy Island and feel uncomfortable with the sense of femininity the shows put forward. \u201d In fact, all the way up through filming Sex and the City, I would feel incredibly repulsed by what I thought was an expectation of me, \u201d Soloway says.",
        "A reporter in West Virginia was arrested and charged with a crime Tuesday after he allegedly attempted to question Health and Human Services commissioner Tom Price. Price was walking through a hallway in the US Capitol, which he was visiting with senior adviser Kellyanne Conway as part of a \u201d listening tour \u201d on the opioid epidemic.

A cuckoo statue and a stand of bamboo sit in front of the school hall \u2019 s orange facade \u2014 and Astro Boy, a cartoon figure, hangs down from a window. From its exterior, there \u2019 s no obvious sign that the school is at the center of a scandal on which the leader of Tokyo has staked his political future.",
        "Chelsea Manning, the former Army agent who leaked a trove of classified material to WikiLeaks, will be released from prison on April 17, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.

        "If you are going to call The Lost City of Mars expecting some sort of Indiana Jones sequel, don \u2019 t worry. Based on the nonfiction book by Michael Grann, the movie moves at a stately pace, with very few scenes. Perhaps the most famous scene happens during a meeting of the Royal Geographical Society, when the protagonist, the British explorer John Fawcett, is trying to convince his friends and skeptical peers that there is indeed an advanced civilization somewhere in the middle of the Amazon rainforest, somewhere between Bolivia and Peru.",
        "At a town hall meeting in Willingboro, N. J. on Wednesday, U. S. Rep.

Tom MacArthur\u2019s town hall didn\u2019t make it clear \u2014 or the group of people singing health protest songs or the Affordable Care Act cemetery or even the plane circling overhead trailing an message \u2014 an early moment in the Republican\u2019s constituent town hall provided a sign this was going to be a long, contentious night. That\u2019s when several people in the Willingboro, N. J. crowd started to boo and jeer when MacArthur talked about his daughter, Grace, who died at age 11. \u201dShame!\u201d yelled one person.",
        "Updated at 7:45 p. m. ET, Undermining the prior rationale laid out by the White House, President Trump said he decided to fire James Comey as FBI director without regard to the Justice Department\u2019s recommendation. \u201dIt was set up a while ago,\u201d Trump admitted to NBC\u2019s Lester Holt in his remarks about his firing of Comey. \u201dAnd frankly, I could have waited, but what difference does it make?\u201d He added, \u201dRegardless of recommendation, I was going to fire Comey.\u201d So why did he make the decision? \u201dHe\u2019s a showboat.

S. intelligence leaders, but his temporary replacement, acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, assured lawmakers he would not bend to pressure from the White House. \u201dYou cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing, protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution,\u201d McCabe said.",
        "In response to President Trump\u2019s surprising firing Tuesday night of FBI Director James Comey, congressional Republicans largely maintained a united front and resisted calls for a special prosecutor to helm the ongoing investigation into Russia and the election. However, cracks in that unity began to emerge in the day that followed, with key senators and some vulnerable House members voicing concern over how the White House handled Comey\u2019s dismissal. \u201dI\u2019ve spent the last several hours trying to find an acceptable rationale for the timing of Comey\u2019s firing.

Now the Office of Government Ethics wants to know if they kept their word. OGE is requiring the Cabinet secretaries and other officials to fill out a new Certification of Ethics Agreement Compliance. NPR obtained a copy of the form before its release Thursday.",
        "The tar baby story in which Bre\u2019r Rabbit outwits Bre\u2019r Fox is a classic trickster folk tale. But like all fables, it is a affair, with entertainment firing in tandem with a serious message. The question the story addresses is a fundamental one: Who controls access to food and water? Or, more crucially, who controls access to food and water when the rules have been turned upside down by giant forces like colonialism, slavery, global trade and the loss of the commons to enclosures?",

        "A few blocks east of the Brandenburg Gate, Cityhostel Berlin offers cheap rooms and spotty in a large, gated 1970s building. But it turns out the hostel is more interesting than its exterior suggests: The building is owned and leased out by North Korea. Located in what was once Communist East Berlin, the hostel is next door to North Korea\u2019s embassy, and was formerly its diplomatic quarters. \u201dParts of the embassy were vacated as relations between Germany and North Korea soured following Germany\u2019s reunification in 1990,\u201d according to The Washington Post.",

        "About 450 million years, animals made one of the most important decisions in Earth\u2019s history: They left the wet, nourishing seas and started living on the dry, desolate land. At that moment, humanity\u2019s problems with superbugs probably began. Scientists at the Broad Institute have found evidence that an important group of bacteria are as old as terrestrial animals themselves. \u201dThese bugs likely lived in the very first creatures that sort of crawled out of the sea and came onto land,\u201d says Ashlee Earl, a geneticist at the Broad Institute, who the study.",

They lose so much fluid that their internal organs shut down. The waterborne disease has been around for centuries, and it remains a global health risk. According to the World Health Organization, there are roughly 3 million cases a year and 90, 000 deaths. The worst outbreak right now is in Haiti, linked to cholera brought by U.

        "The battle over alcohol stores in tiny Whiteclay, Neb. has been going on for decades. Home to roughly about a dozen people, the town has been called a \u201drural skid row.\u201d Images of Lakota people openly drinking in town or staggering drunk on its streets are commonplace. But now, that easy access to alcohol is gone. The state liquor board has shut down Whiteclay\u2019s four controversial liquor stores.
