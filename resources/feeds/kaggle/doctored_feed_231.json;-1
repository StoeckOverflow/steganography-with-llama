Some have been eroded by as much as 85 percent over the last 50 years, while the average total is 39 percent, according to a recent study from the U. S. Geological Survey and Portland State University. The researchers look at historic trends for 39 glaciers, 37 of which are found in the park. The other six are on U. S. Forest Service land. The stark topography actually calls into question whether all of these formations are former glaciers.",

        "A few years later, my son, who was 11, showed me a small captioned photo that he had found online he referred to it as a meme. I explained that he was misusing the term \u201d meme. \u201d The concept of a meme was introduced by Richard Dawkins and then developed by Daniel Dennett and John Blackmore. A meme, according to these scholars, is the chemical analog of a gene like genes, memes spread and, in their evolution, they take on a life of their own.

        "Smell, the thinking principle, is not our strongest sense. Our lowly noses are eclipsed by our inability to see the world around us, hear the notes of music and feel the heat of a caress. Even humans, we \u2019 re taught, have a far more primitive sense of smell than we do. But every scientist argues the concept of an inferior sense of smell stems from a myth. When neuroscientist Robert McGann at Rutgers started applying the sense of smell in rodents to what was natural about the human sense of smell, he had an epiphany.",

        "When discussions about religion and religion turn into debates about science versus science, Buddhism mostly scores a pass. Thanks to the teachings of the Dalai Lama and others, Buddhism can seem far friendlier to secular, scientifically minded sensibilities than the Abrahamic religions.
