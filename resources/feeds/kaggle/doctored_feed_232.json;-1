        "Oh man : it \u2019 s been one of those weeks again. The attack on immigration continues, as the Government promises to punish American cities and cities that have elected not to do ICE \u2019 s work for it by detaining undocumented immigrants until that department can collect them for deportation. A lot of police departments, like the LAPD, have indicated widespread acceptance of deportation in immigrant centers has had deleterious effects on how the police do their jobs. Stories like this usually just increase the anxiety. In addition, reports from victims of recent assaults are down 25 percent from this one last year.",

        "Donald Trump wasn \u2019 t the first president to learn the mainstream media was \u201d fake news \u201d \u2014 and determined to do something about it. In 1939, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was charged with reporting on a leaked document between himself and senators that portrayed his stance toward the emerging Reich of Germany as \u201d the American heart is on the Rhine. \u201d In other words, FDR claimed to be pledging \u2014 in private \u2014 not to allow war to get far outside its borders, thereby making it likely he would commit America to war.",

        "Sean Spicer is back. And so, too, is Melissa McCarthy\u2019s impression of him as the bullying, obfuscating \u201dSpicey.\u201d Chances are, SNL was going to center on the the character whether or not the real Spicer returned to the lectern this week. But the fact that the press secretary made some comical headlines upon his return left no doubt about it \u2014 which only heightened hype for Saturday\u2019s show.

        "My daughter is a perfectionist. In my family, the trait is matrilineal, so I know from firsthand experience that it has a few advantages. My daughter is likely to pay her bills on time and use semicolons correctly. She will not be intimidated by details.

        "Until now, all the controversy over President Trump, his associates and their various connections with various Russians has been billows of smoke without a visible fire. Even last week\u2019s dismissal of FBI Director James Comey must be seen, strictly speaking, as more smoke. It is \u201dtroubling,\u201d as several uneasy Republican senators have said, but, in itself, not real proof of anything. To be sure, Comey\u2019s FBI was conducting an investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.",
        "Marianne Karth and Lois Durso are two mothers on a mission to prevent truck underride collisions. Underride crashes \u2014 when a car collides with a truck and gets lodged underneath \u2014 are among the most fatal types of accidents on the road.
