        "You don \u2019 t need me to ask you how much more television there is than there seems to be, or how many more places you can see it. You don \u2019 t need me to tell you that its audience of creatively ambitious and idiosyncratic shows has risen enormously, as has its population of cheaply made UCSs \u2014 Undiscovered Cable Shows, where you learn that a show is entering its third season and only then do you realise that ( 1 ) it exists and ( 2 ) your byzantine cable TV actually does get that rating ( although perhaps not in Canada ).",
        "Two years ago, when my children were 1 and 4, I \u201d found \u201d the following poem with the assistance of Google \u2019 s autocomplete search system : Today, with children now aged 3 and 6, I decided to repeat the sentiment : What I take away : first, motherhood is hard. That \u2019 s just what the data says. Second, the experience of motherhood isn \u2019 t difficult. An individual mother \u2019 s circumstances change as her children age, as her circumstances are altered, and as her own behavior evolves. Alongside the changing trajectories of different mothers are changing values for parenting and women.",
        "Most of the news from Puerto Rico lately has been lost. The island \u2019 s government just admitted that it cannot repay its bondholders and will carry out drastic cuts in housing and social services. On Saturday, thousands of students at the University of Puerto Rico gather to continue a protest campaign. Food, though, is still a modest ray of hope. That hope will be on display most notably this weekend, at a conference named Agrohack, which celebrates the island \u2019 s newest band of young global entrepreneurs, from chefs to coffee companies. Last year, Agrohack boasted 650 people.",
        "Chicano art never really went out of fashion in California it was born during the art foment of the 1960s and \u2019 70s, and it \u2019 s bubbled along since then for generations. Now there \u2019 s a new wave of the genre, one that \u2019 s taken on a fiercer artistic edge since November. In LA, for example, there \u2019 s a major show opening entitled \u201d Art As Resistance : Paintings in Protest to a Republican Presidency. \u201d It \u2019 s the brainchild of Eric Almanza, a figurative painter and high school art teacher.",
        "The performance by Jos\u00e9 Sobral, this year \u2019 s winner of the Eurovision Song Contest, was better than the others. Most of the performances are noted for a lot of glitz and being pretty cheesy. competitors carried on that tradition this season \u2014 performing on a wide stage backed by flashing lights, bursts of flames and other instruments. Sobral took a different route in his performance on Saturday \u2014 performed from a small elevated podium in the middle of the crowd.

There are about 20 of them, nearly all Palestinians, varying in age from their late 20s to 60s, carrying backpacks and hats, some carrying trekking bags and large cameras.

        "In rural Alaska, providing health coverage means overcoming a lot of obstacles. Fickle weather that can leave people stranded, for one. Wilderness : complicated geography. Native Alaskan villages have no roads connecting them with hospitals or specialists, so many depend on local teachers and a cadre of devoted primary school doctors. I followed one young family physician, Dr. Adam McMahan, on his long weekly visit to the country in the village of Klukwan. It \u2019 s a speck of a town along the Chilkat River in Southeast Alaska, framed by snowy mountains that loom in the mountains.",

The attorney was released next week, after having been swept up in a crackdown that has put most of the country \u2019 s rights lawyers and legal activists out of detention.

        "Investigators looking into the Trump campaign \u2019 s ties to corruption will be able to pursue evidence by tapping into a huge amount of suspicious financial information maintained by the federal government. Under the Bank Secrecy Act, financial institutions operating in the U. S. are supposed to inform the Justice Department \u2019 s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, when they see documents that indicate possible money laundering, such as purchases of expensive real estate.

        "How do you know you are not now dreaming? Any test you might perform, you might be merely dreaming that you are performing. How can you get outside experience to verify that things are, at least once and for all, the way they seem to be? This is philosophical skepticism in the potent and daring form that comes down to us from Ren\u00e9 Descartes. But there are other equally challenging styles of skeptical argument. Take the whole question of other minds. Each of us knows his or her own mind. We experience. We judge. We perceive. We want."
