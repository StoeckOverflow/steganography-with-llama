        "President Obama \u2019 s latest lesson in being chief in chief is a vital message : Intelligence is a team system. For all of America \u2019 s immense military power, global expertise and technical capabilities, we cannot rely on our allies for intelligence.

        "Can you rely on what White House officials think on behalf of the U. S. Government to be true? The answer, supported by the account of President Trump himself, is no. Of all the crises and controversies consuming this White House, perhaps none is more serious than the collapse of its credibility. And a close look at some of the administration \u2019 s decisions, statements and controversies suggests chief responsibility of that collapse can be placed at the feet of the man who died in the Oval Office. Probably one of the latest plays to play out in Washington, D.",

        "In his first foreign trip as president, Donald Trump will be traveling to a Muslim country on Friday. Not just any Muslim state, but the one with the holiest shrines in Islam. Saudi Arabia is a place that candidate Trump loved to bash during his campaign. \u201dUntil the oil went down, Saudi Arabia was making a billion dollars a day. We protect them. We protect them.

The authors of the study didn\u2019t take a position on whether this is an appropriate allocation. But they\u2019ve heard opinions from lots of people. We wanted to know what our audience thinks.",
        "Texas is seeking permission from the federal government for the return of federal family planning money it lost four years ago. It lost those Medicaid funds after it excluded Planned Parenthood and other clinics affiliated with abortion providers from the state\u2019s women\u2019s health program. If President Trump\u2019s administration agrees, Texas could serve as an example to other states wishing to defund Planned Parenthood clinics.

That left some Obamacare customers scratching their heads \u2014 figuratively \u2014 on Twitter. Doktor Zoom, for example, wondered why he\u2019s still paying a premium. In fact, we do have health care in this country \u2014 quite a lot of it. The U. S. spent about $3.",

That day would influence his entire run leading the agency. Mueller oversaw arguably the most significant changes the FBI had gone through, and he received praise from lawmakers from both parties on Wednesday for his commitment to justice. \u201dI had been a prosecutor before, so I anticipated spending time on public corruption cases and narcotics cases and bank robberies and the like,\u201d he told NPR in 2013.",

        "Of course it\u2019s a story about death and Seattle music. I woke up this morning after bad dreams last night, only to find the real nightmare \u2014 that Chris Cornell of Soundgarden was dead. As with all these losses it seems surreal, untrue, unimaginable.
