        "The fight against violence is a \u201d battle between good and bad, \u201d not a fight between \u201d different faiths, different sects, or different civilizations, \u201d President Carter said Sunday in a speech in Saudi Arabia. This is Sunday \u2019 s first foreign address as president, and he delivered the address to leaders of dozens of communities and nations. The Saudis said at least 37 leaders are present, NBC \u2019 s Jane Arraf reported from Riyadh. The presidency focused on pushing the public to do their \u201d fair share \u201d and also \u201d their part of the burden \u201d in the battle against extremists. It did not emphasize human rights.",
        "President Trump \u2019 s first day in Saudi Arabia began with a friendly reception and ended with an ostentatious performance, but not before Trump and the Saudi government signed several deals spanning diplomatic, commercial and commercial ventures, including an arms deal worth $ 110 billion.",
        "It took an inch and 13 pounds of iron to usher in the modern era of neuroscience. In 1848, a railroad engineer named Phineas Gage was pulling up rocks to clear the area for a new rail track in Cavendish, Vt. He would dig a hole, place an electrical charge, then pack in oil using a metal bar known as a tamping iron. But in this instance, the metal bar triggered a spark that touched off the tracks.",
        "Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will donate a combined $ 100 million to a World Bank project for women entrepreneurs that was the brainchild of Ivanka Trump. The announcement by World Bank President Jim Yong Kim came during a visit to Saudi Arabia by President Trump, who was accompanied by his wife, Melania, daughter Ivanka and Jared Kushner. \u201d We thought it was a fantastic idea, \u201d Kim said. \u201d But we had no idea how much this would build. This is certainly a stunning achievement.",
        "Dr. Dilantha Ellegala, a head surgeon, trained doctor who isn \u2019 t a doctor to do brain damage. That is the story featured in the new book A Surgeon in the Village by writer Tony Bartelme. This unlikely version of events had its origins in 2006, when Ellegala was volunteering for a surgical stint at Haydom Hospital in neighboring Tanzania.",
        "On a recent Wednesday afternoon, dozens of lawyers crammed into a small Jon Ossoff for Congress field office in Chamblee, Ga. They were there to canvass for the new newcomer, but they also wanted a treat : a speech from Ossoff himself. He only lasted for about four minutes, but he said almost a minute of it to someone in particular. \u201d It \u2019 s got nothing to do with me, \u201d he said.",
        "A special congressional election in the Atlanta suburbs won \u2019 t be decided until June 20, but there \u2019 s still a clear winner : three TV stations. Senator Karen Handel and Democrat Jon Ossoff face each other in a fight that \u2019 s become a referendum on Donald Trump, and with a month to build, the House race is easily the most expensive in U. S. history. So far, the candidates and campaign groups are on track to raise at least $ 30 million just on online ads.",
        "Dwayne \u201d The Rock \u201d also hosted Saturday Night Live for the fifth season, joining the Club and taking the traditional jacket. He also ended speculation about his latest project, Johnson saying that he would be running for president of the United States. Adam Baldwin, who plays Donald Trump during the show \u2019 s final sketches, came on Twitter to welcome Johnson to the club, and then tried to get Johnson to pick him as a running partner.",
        "When Feld Entertainment, parent of Ringling Bros. announced it \u2019 s canceling the show after nearly 150 years, it was one of the biggest victories ever for animal welfare groups. How the circus treats it people \u2014 especially elephants and even cats \u2014 has long been a focus for groups like the Humane Society of the U. S and People for the Ethical Care of Animals. They see it as part of a larger change coming on in this country \u2014 about how Americans view animals and the way we treat them.",
        "A new Twitter network has grown dramatically in recent months. It \u2019 s named Gab, and its users are invited to # SpeakFreely \u2014 an activity attractive to many users of the far right and others who feel their views are stifled by conservative sites like Google and Facebook. Gab.",
        "Education Director Betsy DeVos has been a passionate supporter of expanding school programs, including private student vouchers and charter schools, and she has the strong backing of President Trump. But does the research justify her advocacy? Experts say one important, overarching issue bedevils their efforts to understand the impact of school improvement programs. That is : It \u2019 s hard to disentangle the status of a school from the selection of its students. Students are never specifically assigned to a school. A city \u2019 s population is always weighted by local demographics.",
        "When Vince Staples releases his sophomore album Dirty Fish Theory last month, he won \u2019 t be the only lanky rapper from Laguna Beach, Calif. with new talent in the marketplace. Big Daddy Snoop Dogg, whose solo project Doggystyle dropped the same year Staples was released, released his 15th studio album this week. And like the term Neva Left suggests, his ubiquitous DJ presence over the last half century is unprecedented in. Snoop \u2019 s ancillary hustle is harder to bark at. The chronic drug upstart is a cannabis startup funder now, with a Hollywood resum\u00e9 instead of starring roles and cameos.",

The cottage society has outgrown its cottage and is on its way to buying up a castle. What \u2019 s a determined mother to do? Alison Weir \u2019 s strategy is to forge new approaches to situations by focusing on the history of the period.

        "They \u2019 re seemingly unavoidable on Instagram these days : photos of bright yellow egg yolks nestled in a fluffy cluster of egg whites, like the sun framed by billowy clouds. They \u2019 re called cloud cakes, and they \u2019 re pretty enough to look like a taste of heaven... which is probably why people are obsessively picking them up and sharing their pictures on social media. Yet the French food fad du jour is like a modern spin on a traditional recipe. \u201d They are basically a very, very special dish.",
        "Updated at 4:30 a. m. ET, Police in Manchester, England, confirm 22 people dead at Manchester Arena following an explosion after a concert by Ariana Grande.

The newspaper had earlier published a detailed account of lobbyists turned appointees who were granted waivers and now oversee regulations they previously had lobbied against.",
        "Picture a kaleidoscope of color and a medley of vivid African print cloth surging forward amid screams and weeping \u2014 for joy.

Tears were streaming down their faces and gave way to broad smiles of happiness and relief after years of torment and trauma and missing their families.",
        "This year marks the 200th anniversary of the birth of the man who invented recorded sound \u2014 Scott de Martinville. He beat the more inventor Thomas Edison by 20 years, though his accomplishments were only recognized over the last decade. While the uses of recorded sound seem obvious now \u2014 music, news, voice messages \u2014 none of it was obvious to Scott or Edison when they made the first recordings. It\u2019s a story that has some lessons for today\u2019s aspiring inventors.",

        "A Mississippi lawmaker apologized Monday for saying the Louisiana leaders who supported the recent removal of four Confederate monuments \u201dshould be LYNCHED!\u201d Karl Oliver, a GOP state representative, had made the comment in a Facebook post this weekend. Here is the original statement: \u201dThe destruction of these monuments, erected in the loving memory of our family and fellow Southern Americans, is both heinous and horrific. If the, and I use this term extremely loosely, \u2019leadership\u2019 of Louisiana wishes to, in a fashion, burn books or destroy historical monuments of OUR HISTORY, they should be LYNCHED!",
        "Attorney General Jeff Sessions is narrowing the scope of an executive order on sanctuary cities. A federal judge in California last month blocked a key part of that order, reasoning that the Trump administration had overstepped by threatening to yank federal money from those places. In the new memo, the attorney general defines the cities narrowly \u201d as places that \u201dwillfully refuse to comply\u201d with federal law. Sessions also made clear the threats apply only to a modest pool of grants administered by the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security, not the entire stream of U. S.",

        "One in eight Americans \u2014 42 million people \u2014 still struggles to get enough to eat. And while that number has been going down recently, hunger appears to be getting worse in some economically distressed areas, especially in rural communities. Food banks that serve these areas are also feeling the squeeze, as surplus food supplies dwindle but the lines of people seeking help remain long. As a result, food banks such as Feeding America Southwest Virginia are trying to shorten those lines by doing more to address the root causes of hunger, such as poverty, unemployment and bad health.",
        "In November 1969, Richard Oakes and dozens of his fellow Native American activists came ashore at Alcatraz. The little island in San Francisco Bay had lain dormant since 1963, when its infamous federal prison had been shut down, and the group Oakes led set out to claim the land as its own. The Indians of All Tribes had a legal basis: the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty between the U. S. and the Sioux and Lakota, which they said returned defunct federal lands to native people.",
        "Refugees make headlines. Internally displaced people don\u2019t. Maybe their plight eludes the limelight because, unlike refugees, they don\u2019t cross international borders . .. or seek to enter the United States or Western Europe, where people debate how many of them to let in . .. or undertake harrowing voyages across the Mediterranean. And maybe it\u2019s because of their official label. \u201dInternally displaced persons\u201d (also known as IDPs) sounds vague and a bit confusing, as if they were lost inside themselves.",
        "A South African professional hunter died Friday after being crushed by an elephant after the animal was fatally shot on a game reserve in Zimbabwe. Theunis Botha, 51, was leading a hunting group when they stumbled upon a breeding herd of elephants at the Good Luck Farm near Hwange National Park, Zimparks spokesman Simukai Nyasha tells The Telegraph.
