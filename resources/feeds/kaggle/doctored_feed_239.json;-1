( I \u2019 m no longer 26 but still female. ) The change made me anxious about whether students would take me seriously as an authority on the subjects I was trying to teach.

        "Whales are the largest animal on the planet, but they haven \u2019 t always been abundant. Fossil records show that smaller whales were much bigger than the currently living behemoths. So when did animals get so big, and how? A new study suggests it could be due to changes in diet that affected the food that some whales eat : krill and small whale. Instead of being spread around the ocean, lots of krill started being packed into a small pool. Bigger whales were simply more effective at eating the dense parts of krill, and they beat out their smaller competitors.",

        "As a TV critic who keeps an eye on social issues, I\u2019ve long been critical of ABC\u2019s The Bachelor and The Bachelorette franchises. They urge viewers to believe completely contrived events are somehow spontaneous. They also support an unhealthy princess fantasy in which romance is conflated with an class wonderland filled with reality TV fame and luxury resort getaways. So why do I find it so important that The Bachelorette is welcoming its first black woman as a star this season?",
