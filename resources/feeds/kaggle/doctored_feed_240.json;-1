        "Public support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has generally peaked in the U. S. Europe and Russia, according to a newly published poll from the Pew Research Center. The uptick in support comes in the wake of the turbulent U. S. leadership race where Donald Trump called NATO \u201d obsolete, \u201d prompting European officials to express alarm. Then, after an unsuccessful meeting with NATO \u2019 s Jens Stoltenberg, Putin declared : \u201d I said it was important.",
        "Twenty percent of children who were in a car crash where someone died were not buckled in seats or were not wearing a seat belt at all, a study finds, as were 43 percent of children who died themselves. And driving fatality rates in deadly car crashes vary dramatically by state. The results give evidence to the argument that state regulations and public transport tactics can affect driving vehicle safety for many.",
        "\u201d Peace is a goal we must make each year, \u201d President Trump stated during a visit to the West Bank city of Bethlehem, where he reiterated his wish to help mediate a peace settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians and sounded upbeat about its development. \u201d The United States is here to truly make that dream true for young Jewish, Christian and Muslim children throughout the region, \u201d Trump announced Tuesday as he stood beside Palestinian Authority spokesman Mahmoud Abbas.",
        "Mistrust and alienation between black people and the police have become so entrenched that we need radical, sweeping reform. The collective experience of white men in the criminal justice system is sobering. African Americans are 2. 5 times more likely to be arrested than whites, and numerous studies have shown that black people are disproportionately targeted, stopped, frisked, and incarcerated through the practice of racial profiling.",
        "In the first of six matches with the world \u2019 s No. 1 ranked player, a Google artificial intelligence program conceded victory Tuesday. It won the tournament by just a fraction of a point in Wuzhen, China, but the win was enough to keep its grandmaster opponent impressed and less confounded by the result. Last day, after Google \u2019 s AlphaGo dispatched Japanese grandmaster Lee Sedol in the notoriously complex card game for the first time, Ke Jie expressed surprise that he wouldn \u2019 t share the same fate, according to The New York Times. After all, Ke had defeated Lee several times himself.",
        "Updated at 12 : 50 p. m. ET, In 1983, an explosive story appeared in an Indian paper, The Patriot : the AIDS Project was the result of American nuclear weapons research. Four years later a British newspaper picked up the story : The U. S. Army had identified AIDS as a bioweapon at Fort Detrick, Md. Other papers followed suit and by 1986, an unnamed German biology student was publishing \u201d research \u201d in which he concluded that the virus had been tested on community members used as wild guinea pigs \u2014 who then began hiding it among vulnerable humans.",
        "Harry Smith has run a consultancy training retail workers in customer services and other basics for 35 years. But in all his years, he has not retrained retail workers for new employment. \u201d Nope we do none of it, \u201d he admits. \u201d I don \u2019 t know that anybody does any of it. \u201d US retail workers are suffering what economists call \u201d job displacement, \u201d meaning they are leaving their jobs largely because of recent technological shifts. Layoffs in retail retail have accelerated significantly this year, with hundreds of store closings and nine U. S. firms filing for bankruptcy so late in 2017.",
        "Would the current Republican health insurance bill impact insurance provided by employers? And why don \u2019 t everyone without insurance just move to an emergency room for emergency care? Here are answers to those and other relevant questions from readers. Will medical care be affected by the proposed Republican plan? The Massachusetts Health Care Act, which recently passed the legislature, would fundamentally change the healthcare insurance market, and it would significantly alter healthcare for people who get sick through their employers, too.",
        "The revised federal bill to repeal and reform the Affordable Care Act will leave 23 million more people uninsured in 2026 than if that Act, also known as Obamacare, were to stay in place. The GOP bill could also reduce the deficit by $ 119 billion over 10 years. That \u2019 s what the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says Wednesday in its latest review of the American Health Reform Act. The CBO \u2019 s assessment suggested that the deficit would rise and premiums would fall for some reason, but the report also stated potential concerns about the cost.",
        "The year was 1945, and Lindy Johnson had been given a few weeks to recover. She suffered from diarrhea and projectile vomiting, and she was so thin and weak, she could no longer speak. Her parents had taken her from physician to doctor. Finally, Dr. Douglas Arnold in Raleigh, N. Y. offered a most difficult prescription : She was to eat bananas. \u201d At least seven bananas a day, \u201d writes the patient, who now goes by her real name, Lindy Redmond. \u201d To whom it may go, \u201d the doctor wrote on a medical pad that Lindy still has as a keepsake.",

        "President Trump had an audience with Pope Francis at the Vatican\u2019s Apostolic Palace on Wednesday, receiving messages about peace, the environment and immigrants from the religious leader. The meeting came a year after the pope suggested that Trump \u201dis not Christian\u201d because of his plan for a U. border wall. Their encounter was smooth and brief, lasting about 30 minutes.

        "During papal audiences with heads of state, the exchange of gifts comes after the private encounter and at the end of the event.

For example, Pope Francis gave President Trump a large medallion depicting an olive branch as a symbol of peace.",
        "There were few fireworks Wednesday as Education Secretary Betsy DeVos testified before a House appropriations subcommittee on the Trump administration\u2019s 2018 budget proposal. DeVos deflected much of the skepticism she received and continued to push the administration\u2019s support of school choice. President Trump\u2019s proposal, which has drawn sharp criticism from educators and lawmakers alike, calls for $1. 4 billion to expand school choice \u2014 namely vouchers and charter schools \u2014 but slashes $10. 6 billion from programs, teacher training and federal student loans and grants.",

        "Oil producers across the country are watching to see what OPEC does at its meeting in Vienna this week, since the cartel of countries has recently played a big role in turning around a U. S. slump. There are more than twice as many U. S. rigs drilling for oil as a year ago, a turnaround that\u2019s felt keenly in places like the Bakken oil patch in North Dakota.

        "After making the need for a wall along the U. S. border a central campaign theme, President Trump has asked Congress for just $1. 6 billion to start building 74 miles of barriers. Texas alone shares more than 1, 200 miles of border with Mexico.

What do House of Cards, Girls, I Love Dick, Orphan Black, Transparent and The Magicians have in common? Every one of them has featured unconventional romantic or sexual relationships involving more than two people. Exhibit A: the arrangement between the fictional president of the United States and First Lady on one of Netflix\u2019s most popular shows, House of Cards.

        "The NBA has announced that Charlotte, N. C. will host the 2019 Game, after the state partially repealed its controversial law that limited civil rights protections for LGBT people. The professional basketball league moved last year\u2019s game from Charlotte, where it was originally scheduled, to protest the state\u2019s HB2 law. \u201dWhile we understand the concerns of those who say the repeal of HB2 did not go far enough, we believe the recent legislation eliminates the most egregious aspects of the prior law,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement.",

And most of those cases originated in the Caribbean. The study, published Wednesday in Nature, examined more than 250 cases of local Zika transmission in three Miami neighborhoods. Researchers analyzed 39 Zika virus genomes isolated from 32 people who had been infected and seven Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the species that carries Zika.",
        "There\u2019s a rich body of evidence that links chocolate to heart health. Now comes a new study that finds people who consume small amounts of chocolate each week have a lower risk of developing atrial fibrillation, a heart condition characterized by a rapid or irregular heartbeat. \u201dThe rate of atrial fibrillation was 20 percent lower for people consuming two to six servings [of chocolate] per week\u201d compared with people who ate chocolate less than once per month, explains study author Elizabeth Mostofsky, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.

        "It was in May 1986 that Top Gun brought the need for speed \u2014 and beach volleyball \u2014 to American movie theaters. In the 31 years since, we\u2019ve seen Tom Cruise sprint his way from playing Maverick to Ron Kovic and Jerry Maguire to the guy in Mission Impossible five times and Jack Reacher twice (and some other stuff). But these are complicated times. And we might be forgiven our nostalgia for a simpler era when we knew less about Tom Cruise. When yes, he was an action star, but an action star who cried when Goose died.",
        "Two thieves. Thirteen pieces of art. years of mystery. And now, a $10 million reward \u2014 for anyone who can bring those missing masterpieces back to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.

        "I often get asked what an \u201dexpanding universe\u201d really means. It\u2019s confusing, and for very good reasons. So, if you are perplexed by this, don\u2019t feel bad. We all are, although cosmologists \u2014 physicists that work on the properties of the universe \u2014 have figured out ways to make sense of it. In what follows, I\u2019ll try to explain how to picture this. In the next few weeks, we will address other bizarre cosmic questions, such as the meaning of the Big Bang and the future and material composition of the universe.",
        "Sleek, wristbands are extremely popular these days, promising to measure heart rate, steps taken during the day, sleep, calories burned and even stress. And, increasingly, patients are heading to the doctor armed with reams of data gathered from their devices. \u201dThey\u2019re essentially asking us to digest the data and offer advice about how to avoid cardiovascular disease,\u201d says cardiologist Euan Ashley, associate professor of medicine at the Stanford University Medical Center and Stanford Hospital and Clinics in northern California. And, being somewhat near Silicon Valley, he says he gets a lot of patients bringing data to appointments."
