        "In the Montana State congressional election on March, President Trump is the president hanging over a race that neither candidate can fully defeat \u2014 even though they \u2019 re candidate. The contest to replace Montana \u2019 s Interior secretary, State GOP Rep. Ryan Zinke, has gotten uncomfortably close in a race the president carried by 20 votes.",
        "The Fox News Channel has retracted a story based on a groundless conspiracy theory concerning the death of a staffer for the Democratic National Committee, conceding it did not meet the party \u2019 s standards. The retracted May 16 TV story reported as stating that the late Seth Brown, a Democratic National Committee staffer, was actually the person who passed tens of thousands of letters from the DNC to WikiLeaks and that his murder was tied to that letter.",
        "George Foreman at 25 years old was a fearsome champion : 6 feet 4, biceps thick and gnarled as oak, a constant scowl on his face and a massive hand that flattened every opponent he faced. So when Muhammad Ali challenged him in 1974 for a televised fight dubbed the Rumble in the Congo in Zaire ( now the Democratic Republic of the Congo ) most bets were on Foreman. Ali was seven years older and past his prime. He \u2019 d had his title stripped after escaping the Vietnam draft in 1967 and was looking to become a contender again.",
        "Updated at 5 : 40 p. m. ET, The 4th U. S. District Court of Appeals has ordered that President Trump \u2019 s annual travel ban should be put on hold, maintaining a final preliminary injunction that prohibited key elements of the executive order from being enforced. A portion of the court heard appeals over the ban earlier this evening. In Thursday \u2019 s decision, the federal judge writes that the travel ban \u201d drips with religious intolerance, animus, and racism. \u201d Trump has signed four executive orders restricting refugees from a handful of countries and placing a temporary moratorium on refugees.",
        "Updated at 10 p. m. ET, Polls have closed in the much watched Montana presidential election. The race was upended in the following hours following an altercation between the Democratic congressional candidate, Anthony Gianforte, and a reporter, adding yet more uncertainty to an unusually heated contest. Gianforte was charged one evening with misdemeanor assault against Susan Jacobs, a reporter for The Nation. The incident has drawn public attention to the race to keep Interior Secretary David Zinke, considered a bellwether, in its final years.",
        "In one of his most controversial since leaving the White House, former president Obama warned hundreds of thousands of young Americans in Berlin that \u201d the international landscape is at a crossroads. \u201d President Trump was disappointed in Europe, chiding NATO troops while in Belgium for not living up to levels. Obama delivered an implicit rebuke to NATO \u2019 s \u201d America First \u201d program, saying in the modern, interconnected world, \u201d we can \u2019 t isolate ourselves.",
        "At a NATO meeting in Brussels, President Thursday marked the unveiling of memorials of the Berlin Wall and the Sept. 11 attacks with a note that, among other things, told gathered NATO leaders their levels of defense policy are \u201d not fair \u201d to U. S. taxpayers. Wednesday also omitted any official statement of support for Article 5, the NATO pledge \u2014 many other leaders had been hoping to deliver. The Associated Press describes Thursday \u2019 s speech as an \u201d political punch \u201d that \u201d further rattled \u201d an increasingly anxious Europe.",
        "A Manchester Guardian \u2019 s impromptu rendition of \u201d Don \u2019 t Look Back in Anger, \u201d by hometown rivals Oasis, emerged as an uplifting emblem of resilience after Bush \u2019 s deadly bombing there. The final singing followed a whole minute of silence to honour the 22 people killed as they played a concert at Manchester Airport. It started with a lone song. The Guardian says people began to sing the group \u2019 s 1996 hit. Soon others joined in and the song carried through the crowd in St. Peter \u2019 s Square. \u201d It really broke my heart.",
        "Updated at 4 : 46 p. m. ET, Police in Bristol, England, decided to consider sharing some intelligence with the U. S. after details from their ongoing international investigation were apparently leaked to the American press, the town \u2019 s mayor told police. President Trump stated that the source of the leaks will be identified.",
        "The sudden departure of an Obama appointee who oversaw federal aid at the U. S. Department of Education has brought forth competing explanations. James Runcie managed the Federal Academic Aid office, which administers $ 150 billion in grants, loans and loans that help 13 million people pay for college each year. The announcement of his resignation occurred a day after the Trump administration called for large cuts to these aid programs and on the same morning that Runcie \u2019 s boss, Education Director Betsy DeVos, was testifying about those cuts on Capitol Hill.",
        "NASA \u2019 s Juno spacecraft has spotted large cyclones swirling at Jupiter \u2019 s north and south poles. That \u2019 s just one of the unexpected and puzzling findings being announced by the Juno science group. Juno arrived at Jupiter last summer. It \u2019 s the third spacecraft to get a cyclone at the planet \u2019 s poles. It \u2019 s in an arc that takes it skimming close to the extreme tops of the gas giant once every 53 days. After each new pass, the spacecraft carried a trove of data back to Jupiter. Scientists weren \u2019 t expecting to find cyclones at the poles.",
        "Skirting California \u2019 s topography, Highway 1 offers a long and dramatic drive through the Big Sur region. On a clear day, a drive along the winding road turns one \u2019 s heart fill with fears of plunging down the hillside. But a large landslide has reshaped the coastline and destroyed part of the route, as a third of a mile of highway is now covered with dirt and rocks at an inlet called Mud Creek. As you can see in the graphic below, where the coast begins to form roughly a straight line, it \u2019 s now a rocky bulge into the ocean.",
        "Four decades ago Friday, The Dallas Morning News committed an error so grave, so egregious, that it long remained shrouded in silence \u2014 out of a deep sense of shame and that one can only imagine.",
        "This week, the latest installment in the Star Wars film saga is posting record numbers around the world. In 1981, NPR hoped the interstellar fable would do the same for its audience numbers. That\u2019s right: Some of you may have forgotten (and some might not even know) that the network created three radio dramas based on George Lucas\u2019 original three movies. NPR figured it could maybe get more listeners by reviving the radio drama, which had been out of fashion for some 30 years.",
        "How is this for a first day on the job: Maurice Murphy, the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO)\u2019s late principal trumpet player, spent his very first day with the orchestra recording Star Wars\u2019 iconic opening theme, with its incredible brass fanfare \u2014 and Murphy leading the trumpets. \u201dIt was an amazing moment, that blast of brass that opens the film. It was the first sound I heard from Maurice, really,\u201d the film\u2019s composer, John Williams, told the London Symphony Orchestra in a 2007 podcast celebrating Murphy, who was then retiring from the orchestra. \u201dIt was electrifying . ..",
        "By night, they play gigs. By day, they sample ramen in cities across America. They\u2019re the three women of Shonen Knife, a legendary rock band from Japan. For over 35 years, the band has been serving up infectious punk songs with a delicious twist: Many of them are about food. Think song titles like \u201dWasabi,\u201d \u201dHot Chocolate\u201d and \u201dSushi Bar.\u201d But don\u2019t dismiss them as bubblegum pop: Over the years, some of their biggest fans have included giants of music. This spring, Shonen Knife embarked on its latest adventure \u2014 a ramen rock tour of the U. S.",
        "When Ahmed Badr was 8 years old, his family\u2019s home in Baghdad was bombed in the midst of the Iraq War. The family was uninjured. They moved to Syria, which was peaceful then, and in 2008, they came to the U. S. as refugees. Writing helps Badr deal with what he\u2019s been through, and he wants to give other young people the same outlet. Now a student at Wesleyan University, Badr founded the website Narratio to empower others to tell their stories. Badr used writing to figure out what it meant to be an kid.",
        "May 25 is Red Nose Day in the United States. And millions of people are probably going, \u201dhuh, what?\u201d The short explanation: It\u2019s a campaign to raise money to fight child poverty. But how does buying a red foam nose at a drugstore for a buck help the cause? And does this charity with the silly name really do good work? We did some reporting, and here\u2019s what we learned. The British charity Comic Relief started Red Nose Day in England in 1985 as a way to raise money to fight child poverty.",
        "Singer and Krystle Warren has been compared to artists like Tracy Chapman and Nina Simone. The latter comparison is particularly intriguing: Not only does Warren share that icon\u2019s talent for evocative storytelling, but she also lives in France, as Simone once did. It\u2019s a long way from her native Kansas City, Mo. which Warren left in her early 20s to pursue her music career. On her forthcoming album Three The Hard Way, Warren pays tribute to her roots. Warren tells NPR\u2019s Audie Cornish that she has been feeling the pull of home more than ever.",
        "Most anyone who has encountered a flamingo has probably been impressed by its signature ability to balance on a single long, spindly leg for remarkably long periods of time. But actually, scientists have now shown that what appears to be a feat requires almost no muscle activity from the bird. In fact, they found even a dead flamingo\u2019s body will naturally fall into a stable balance if positioned vertically. That research was recently published in Biology Letters.",
        "Health care groups that represent doctors and patients are warning members of Congress that the House Republicans\u2019 plan to overhaul the Affordable Care Act would hurt people who need insurance most. The groups are responding to the latest assessment by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which concluded that the proposed American Health Care Act would leave 23 million more people without health insurance than under current law and would cut the deficit by $119 billion over 10 years.",
        "The title of Cate Shortland\u2019s new film, Berlin Syndrome, is a sly riff on \u201dStockholm syndrome,\u201d that condition in which a hostage begins to feel sympathy for her captor. It\u2019s never clear what sets the Berlin version apart, and in some ways Shortland and the screenwriter, Shaun Grant, seem to be figuring it out as they go along. That\u2019s not a knock. Berlin Syndrome might look on the surface like a polished a crafty and violent tale of a woman in captivity but it\u2019s also the rare psychological thriller that feels not just taut and gripping, but genuinely exploratory.",
        "Updated at 2 p. m. ET, U. S. personnel \u201dcould not have predicted\u201d that dozens of Mosul residents would be in a building where ISIS snipers were firing when they authorized a strike on it in March, the Pentagon says in a newly released report. That airstrike in Iraq killed at least 105 civilians. The report also says the building collapsed after the strike triggered explosives that had been planted by ISIS. \u201dOur condolences go out to all those that were affected,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Joe Martin, commanding general of the ground force fighting ISIS.",
        "U. S. aid for international family planning would be eliminated. Programs to combat in the world\u2019s poorest countries would be slashed by 17 percent. Efforts to fight malaria would be chopped by 11 percent. Those are just some of the cuts to global health spending called for by President Trump in the proposed budget he unveiled this week. On one level the reductions did not come as a surprise. Trump had already made clear in his \u201dskinny budget\u201d proposal, released in March, that he wanted to lower spending on foreign assistance by more than a third.",
        "One of President Trump\u2019s boldest, most ambitious proposals on the campaign trail was to build a wall along the Southern border and get Mexico to pay for it. Amid the tumult of Trump\u2019s first few months in office, the border wall hasn\u2019t gotten as much attention as some other things. But new legislation has been introduced in Congress to help fund it. It\u2019s called the Border Wall Funding Act of 2017, introduced on March 30 by Rep. Mike Rogers, .",
        "The Fox News Channel has struck back at a lawyer representing former host Andrea Tantaros in her sexual harassment allegations against the network, belittling his claims Fox used online accounts to intimidate her and asking that he be punished by the court. The network\u2019s volleys responded mockingly to a lawsuit filed by attorney Judd Burstein late last month alleging that Fox News executives arranged for Tantaros\u2019 private exchanges to be spied on as part of a campaign of intimidation relying on online sock puppets.",
        "If you fly into Haines, Alaska, you\u2019ll be on a prop plane so small that your pilot will call the roll. \u201dMelissa.\u201d Yup. \u201dMary.\u201d Yes. \u201dJoseph?\u201d Right here. Just 2, 500 people live in Haines \u2014 a small town in southeast Alaska surrounded by water. The scenery is incredible, with snowy mountains and lush green forest beyond. The city center is just a few blocks, with several bars, a few restaurants and a beautiful, library. But lately, this idyllic place has been roiled by a bitter political battle.",
        "Model Dani Mathers, whose haughty posting of a photo of a naked woman at her gym sparked outrage last summer, will be punished by spending a month removing graffiti in Los Angeles. Mathers pleaded no contest to a charge of invading the woman\u2019s privacy. \u201dThe issues that surround body shaming can be devastating,\u201d Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer said, \u201dnot only to daughters and mothers, but also to sons and fathers, members of the LGBTQ community, to a trans kid who might be struggling with identity, to people who are disabled.",
        "In the early 1950s, Clarence White was a rookie policeman with the Indianapolis Police Department, and being there were rules he needed to follow. He says the department had a gentleman\u2019s agreement where black cops could not arrest white people. White is the patriarch of three generations of police officers in the Indianapolis Police Department. It was a career he initially did not want. \u201dI was sort of forced into this,\u201d says White.",
        "When it comes to poor Americans, the Trump administration has a message: Government aid is holding many of them back. Without it, many more of them would be working. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Mick Mulvaney said as much when presenting the administration\u2019s budget plan this week to cut safety net programs by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years. The administration also wants to tighten work requirements for those getting aid, such as food stamps, or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits."
