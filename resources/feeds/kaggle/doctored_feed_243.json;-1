        "What a week it \u2019 s been for breaking news. Let \u2019 s give NPR Ed \u2019 s blog roundup as the week began, on Sunday... DeVos talks choice in Indiana, It was expected to be an important occasion, perhaps the unveiling of President Bush \u2019 s $ 20 billion plan to improve school choice nationwide. But that didn \u2019 t happen. Instead, when State Secretary Betsy DeVos took the stage in Indianapolis at the National Federation For Children \u2019 s National Policy Summit, she embraced philosophy. \u201d It \u2019 s fitting that we \u2019 re in Georgia, one of the states that is making real choices for teachers and students, \u201d DeVos told the press.",
        "There \u2019 s a narrative about the methamphetamine epidemic in Montana that says the military tackled it in the 2000s, yet now it \u2019 s back with a boom because of super labs and drug cartels in Mexico. But here on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation, it never quite went away. \u201d sit high in your car in back of the store that ain \u2019 t a big thing, \u201d says Miranda Carlson. Kirk works on the ranch, which is about 40 miles south of the Kansas border. She says no one even bothers to hide their drug use.",
        "On a Saturday afternoon, 10 students gather at Genspace, a research lab in Brooklyn, to discuss how to edit genes. There \u2019 s a recent graduate with a master \u2019 s in evolutionary biology, a high school student who started a college biology club, a college student, an eighth grader, and one who works in pharmaceutical research. \u201d This is so cool to learn about I hadn \u2019 t seen biology since like ninth grade, \u201d says Ruthie Nachmany, one of the class girls. She had studied anthropology, media arts, and environmental sciences in college, but is now a software engineer.",
        "Here \u2019 s a quick roundup of some of the you would have missed on this week \u2019 s New Edition. What a world, actually, the life of a. It \u2019 s usually pretty great and carefree. You still have to get to school at 6, but at that point life is fresh, new and good. Looking back, you \u2019 re definitely feeling a bit nostalgic, but maybe you \u2019 re also asking yourself what you had seen by the time you \u2019 d been on Earth for many years. Chances are it \u2019 s not nearly as amazing as what DJ Itsuki Morita has done.",
        "When Roger Bond died last summer at the age of 89, many tributes recalled him as the actor who \u2019 d played James Bond the longest. That isn \u2019 t entirely wrong, but it isn \u2019 t exactly wrong. The span between his first 007, Live and Let Die, and his latest, A View to a Kill, was 12 years, during which he played the famous character in seven movies. But Sean Connery, who \u2019 d quit the role with one film remaining on his watch only to be lured back twice, actually got to seven, too.",
        "Known for his collaborations with Weather Report, Joni Mitchell and Pat Metheny, Jaco Pastorius was one of the most inventive bass players in music history. He is the only electric bassist in DownBeat FM \u2019 s Jazz Hall of Fame. But like with many electric geniuses, alcohol and drugs took a toll \u2014 as did his bipolar disorder \u2014 and Pastorius grew up living on the streets. He left in 1987, after a violent encounter with a bouncer in a Sydney nightclub. But new musicians still discover his potential.",
        "Back when Stefani Taylor was 17, she felt isolated and lost. Her mother was raising her daughter while her father battled heroin addiction. One night, she decided she was done with going to school. \u201d No one would talk me out of it, \u201d says Ashley, who soon ended up jumping out of her car. Eleven weeks later, she \u2019 s in the Peace Clinic, trying to help dropouts in school in a similar situation.",
        "Judith Leiber \u2019 s handbags are intended for wowing \u2014 not schlepping. They \u2019 re shaped like penguins, spiders, zebras, streetcars and firecrackers. First ladies and rising stars have carried them, and now they \u2019 re the object of an exhibition at the Museum of Art and Design in Manhattan. \u201d I wanted to make something that was more interesting and more special than what other people bought, \u201d explains Leiber, now 96. But that also means they weren \u2019 t cheap. \u201d I wanted to buy the most expensive bags that anybody could make, \u201d she admits.",
        "It \u2019 s planting season in America. Farmers are spending long days on their tractors, pushing massive planters across thousands of acres of farmland, blowing corn and soybean seeds into the air. Most of those seeds have been coated with pesticides known as neonicotinoids, or neonics for short. And despite attempts by pesticide makers to reduce this, some of that stuff is getting rubbed off the soil and blown into the air. That fungus is settling on the ground, on leaves, and on vegetation nearby.",
        "Nearly every weekend since Inauguration day, President Trump has traveled from Washington to one of his homes outside the capital. Most days he has stayed at his private hotel in Palm Beach, Fla. In March, he hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping there for a summit session, and in February he invited Chinese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe down for a round of golf. Trump has also overnighted at his golf resort in Bedminster, N. J. All the time means a lot of information for the U. S. Secret Service, the legendary agency that interviews presidents and their families.",
        "Sherpas are extraordinary spiritual beings. In the high plains of the Himalayas, members of the Nepalese ethnic groups are famous for their records, ascents of heights that no one has ascended before, animal guiding and other skills. What makes Sherpas so good at climbing into the wispy clouds of the world \u2019 s tallest peak? They may be better at harnessing gravity than the rest of us, adding a new study, which still offers insights that could eventually help young people whose bodies become deprived of oxygen because of medical conditions.",
        "Lim lives in a tiny apartment in a bustling student neighborhood of South Korea\u2019s capital, Seoul. The apartment is just 30 sq. ft. \u2014 basically a closet with a toilet, shower and shared kitchen \u2014 for $400 a month. \u201dIt\u2019s uncomfortable, because when I lay down my legs hit the back wall,\u201d explains Lim, 25. She has to be quiet because the walls are thin. Lim\u2019s neighbors are all young people like her, studying 15 hours a day for job entrance exams. Lim graduated at the top of her high school class. She wants to be an accountant.",

        "This week\u2019s physical assault by Montana\u2019s new GOP Congressman, Greg Gianforte against The Guardian reporter, Ben Jacobs \u2014 who was asking a question about the budget \u2014 is the latest example of hostility toward journalists. But, unlike those others, which only caused tiny blips on the radar of average media consumers, the Jacobs body slam appears to have hurled the American public into a new realm of incivility. The violent incident \u2014 that went viral instantly \u2014 has people wondering if an invisible line has been crossed. Reaction in the social media world, from all sides, raised three questions.",
        "Fifty years ago, The Beatles released Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band. It\u2019s acknowledged nearly universally as one of the most and influential rock albums of all time \u2014 and critic Colin Fleming argues that the artwork on the cover is just as important as the music. The Sgt. Pepper\u2019s cover art, by pop artist Peter Blake, is iconic.

        "When artist Nora Litz first talked with her students about immigration \u2014 she was shocked to hear how scared they were. \u201dI felt I had to do something,\u201d she says.

The class is called Illustrated Stories of Immigration \u2014 a free, comics workshop led by artists and writers every Saturday.",
        "For many people, New Orleans is practically synonymous with jazz it\u2019s the birthplace of both the music and many of its leading lights, from Louis Armstrong to Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah. But now, one organization is working to draw attention to the city\u2019s history of opera music. OperaCr\u00e9ole, an opera company founded in New Orleans, is resurrecting music written by local composers of color and others who\u2019ve been left out of the overwhelmingly white, male canon. The company\u2019s latest production, La Flamenca, is by the Creole composer Guillaume Lambert, whose father was born in New Orleans.",
        "By the end of the state legislative session in Texas on Monday, the Capitol had devolved into scuffles and grave accusations. A Democratic lawmaker had accused his GOP colleague of threatening to \u201dput a bullet\u201d in another lawmaker\u2019s head. That GOP state representative, meanwhile, accused a counterpart of threatening his life, saying he was prepared to use his gun in . To understand how the day ended this way, one must first rewind to its start.",
        "Updated at 4:11 p. m. ET, Through nearly four decades, at least five presidential administrations and seemingly countless Super Bowls and World Series, NPR listeners could depend on at least one thing in the world of athletics: Frank Deford. A mainstay on Morning Edition, the Hall of Fame sportswriter was public radio\u2019s scholar of sports for some 37 years before hanging up his cleats earlier this year. Deford died Sunday at the age of 78 at his home in Key West, Fla. his wife confirmed to NPR. He leaves behind an astonishing 1, 656 commentaries for NPR.",
        "Frank Deford, NPR\u2019s sports commentator, announced Wednesday that he\u2019s retiring after 37 years on Morning Edition \u2014 37 years of entertaining, educating and yes, annoying some listeners, like any good commentator should. The warnings from Frank Deford arrived via email, days before our scheduled interview. When I get to his third floor apartment in Key West, Fla. Deford cautioned, I\u2019ll be greeted by a screeching dog. He was right, although Miss Snickers, Deford\u2019s yorkiepoo rescue, sounded more ferocious than she actually was.",
        "For families spread out across the country, videos and video chats have become a meaningful way to share a baby\u2019s first steps, a birthday party or a loved one blowing a kiss. But for people in prison, rules limiting access to the Internet and cameras can make sharing these moments difficult. In Colorado Springs, an artist came up with a creative solution. Like many proud parents, Nicole Garrens captured her son Zander\u2019s first steps on her cellphone. She wanted to share the video with her husband, Roy, but he recently went to prison in Texas.",
        "Updated at 12:15 p. m. ET, Newly elected French President Emmanuel Macron and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, had a whole lot of ground to cover Monday: Between the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the civil war in Syria and their own countries\u2019 tattered ties, the Russian president\u2019s stop at the Palace of Versailles promised plenty of difficult topics for conversation. It\u2019s little wonder, then, that talks between the two leaders at the Palace of Versailles outside Paris ran a little longer than expected.",
        "On the heels of last week\u2019s summit, German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a call for European Union nations on Sunday. At a Munich stop on the campaign trail, Merkel told supporters that Europe can no longer count on the U. S. and the U. K. as reliable allies. The days that Europe could completely rely on others are \u201dover to a certain extent,\u201d Merkel warned at a rally in a packed Bavarian beer tent, Reuters reports.",
        "Donald Trump made his first Memorial Day remarks as president, paying tribute Monday to fallen U. S. service members, and thanking their families for their sacrifice. \u201dWords cannot measure the depth of their devotion, the purity of their love, or the totality of their courage. We only hope that every day we can prove worthy, not only of their sacrifice and service, but of the sacrifice made by the families and loved ones they left behind,\u201d Trump said. \u201dSpecial, special people,\u201d he added.",
        "A towering oak tree draped with Spanish moss offers little relief from the Florida sun as Andrew Lumish scrubs grime from the headstone of a World War I veteran. \u201dIt\u2019s pretty messy, pretty dirty,\u201d he says. \u201dWe\u2019re pulling out dirt and biological material that\u2019s been here since 1921. So, a lot of elbow grease here.\u201d Lumish, who has so far cleaned about 600 veterans\u2019 headstones, says he restores them out of respect for those who died and to learn about how they lived.",
        "\u201dI hope you\u2019re having a meaningful day.\u201d That might be one of the better things to say to a veteran this Monday. You should probably avoid the common refrain, \u201dThank you for your service,\u201d according to someone who should know. \u201dOn Memorial Day, the veteran you\u2019re talking to may be going through a bit of melancholy remembering people who died over the years,\u201d says Navy veteran Luke Visconti, who also the website DiversityInc, which wrote about the subject recently. As most people are aware (or should be) Memorial Day and Veterans Day serve different purposes.",
        "Diagnosing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can be difficult. The symptoms of the disorder, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, or DSM, have changed multiple times. Even if you know what to look for, many of the symptoms are pretty general, including things like trouble focusing and a tendency to interrupt people. Discerning the difference between people who have a problem and those who are just distracted requires real expertise.",
        "Tomas Villegas was looking for information about a product on YouTube, but couldn\u2019t find it. \u201dSo I thought, well, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s other people looking for it. So I made a video.\u201d Four years later, Villegas, who works at a technical college, has a side business doing product reviews on his YouTube channel. He found that adding a little music really improved his videos. \u201dIt just adds that third dimension that is missing sometimes,\u201d he says. Of these two music excerpts, one is composed by Vivaldi and the other is a computer imitation of his style.",
        "Computers are part of the everyday sounds of our times \u2014 for a while. But as each new digital device slips into inevitable obsolescence, so do their signature sounds. Composer Matt Parker thought that meant losing touch with some of our history \u2014 so, he\u2019s has created an archive of 126 sound recordings from the historic computers of Bletchley Park, the site where British mathematicians, scientists and spies broke German\u2019s military codes during World War II. And he\u2019s worked those sounds into a new series of musical compositions on an album called The Imitation Archive."
