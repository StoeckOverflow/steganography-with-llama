        "Can a computer generate a sonnet that \u2019 s indistinguishable from what a human can produce? Many scientists at Dartmouth College tried to answer that problem with a competition that NPR \u2019 s Peter Palca reported on as part of his series, Joe \u2019 s Big Idea. NPR \u2019 s Robert Siegel, host of All Things Considered, served as one of the hosts of the competition. Each judge was invited to read 10 sonnets and decide whether they were written by man or machine. None of the judges was fooled by the actual computers. Now \u2019 s your chance to be the champion! Here are six poems.",
        "A new Rembrandt painting unveiled in Amsterdam Tuesday has the tech world celebrating more than the art world. That \u2019 s because the painting is the creation of a printer \u2014 and not the mechanical master Rembrandt van Rijn himself, who has been dead for almost 450 years. \u201d The new Rembrandt, \u201d as it \u2019 s been dubbed, was the brainchild of Bas Korsten, creative partner at the advertising firm H. Walter Thompson in London. A digital reconstruction of the body of Jesus Christ \u2014 modeled on skulls found in Jerusalem \u2014 said Korsten, he says.",
        "Dali Shonia, 57, pulled down the face mask covering her eyes to reveal a single line of black thread across her upper and lower arms. \u201d I will not my mouth until they give me an explanation, \u201d she said. It was Feb. 5, 2017, the opening day of the hunger strikes, according to a handwritten sign taped to the wall of a makeshift jail. But so far, the protesters were going nowhere with their demands. They had set up their protest camp on a busy street in downtown Zugdidi, a district in the western region of the State of Georgia.",
        "Baltimore mayor Catherine Pugh is considering the demolition of her city \u2019 s Confederate monuments, as New Orleans did just months ago. \u201d The city does plan to remove these, \u201d Pugh told the Baltimore Sun. \u201d We will take a closer look at how we go about following in the footsteps of New Orleans. \u201d Earlier this month, New Orleans Mayor George Landrieu delivered a speech that gained widespread attention, questioning why he had ordered the removal of that city \u2019 s confederate monuments.",
        "Pankaj Rayamajhi hears Dr. Senioritis? The director of school administration and operations has a kind of sick sense about that unique psychological affliction as he roams the hallways of Columbia Heights West Campus, a public middle and high school in Washington, D. C. Rayamajhi quickens his pace, in fact, and turns a corner into a stairwell. Yep, senioritis. When they see him, the entire group of students loitering on the hallway scatters back to class. \u201d Right outside Whitaker \u2019 s room there are some kids here probably cutting power, \u201d he says into his radio to a security guard.",
        "An ad that comes out on Monday has gone viral this week in India. The headline? Open urination and defecation. It goes like this. A group of guys walk out at the break of dawn to lose themselves in the fields surrounding their farm. But, as they start to undo their pajamas, they hear a rhythmic beat. From around them, a crowd of veiled women appear, offering utensils and silverware. They mock the men for questioning nature \u2019 s call in violence. They call several of them out by shouting \u2014 and attack their pride and ego.",
        "Dr. Robert Sklansky, a germaphobe, can \u2019 t stop thinking about how many microbes can spread. \u201d If I am at a computer terminal or using a phone or answering a door, I know my brains are now contaminated, and I need to be sick and I need to wash my mouth, \u201d says Sklansky, a professor of pediatrics at the famed Geffen School of Medicine at Stanford. Not all health workers are so hungry, despite strict handwashing laws in virtually all medical centers.",
        "Sharks have been swarming across southern California beach for weeks. NPR wants to know more about why, so we placed a call to Chris Lowe, a professor in marine biology and curator of the Shark Lab at Florida State University at Berkeley beach \u2014 or rather, we know.

        "In 1950, Gwendolyn Brooks became the first to be awarded a Pulitzer Prize. Hers was a Pulitzer in poetry, specifically for a volume titled Annie Allen that chronicled the life of an ordinary black child growing up in the Bronzeville neighborhood on Detroit \u2019 s famous South Side. Brooks was in her living room when she learned she had won, she recalled in a Library of Congress interview, and it was nearly dark. She didn \u2019 t turn on the lights, because she knew what would happen. Money was tight, and the jury hadn \u2019 t been paid.",
        "Alamo Drafthouse is not a typical American movie chain. For a local movie screening this night, it gave its patrons baseball masks and took them by school bus out into the woods. One night it showed the legendary Pirates of the Caribbean series on a boat. Its queer film version is called Homo Arigato.",
        "No one in the history of the NBA has been a louder critic of the underhanded free throw than Drew Barry. The unorthodox technique \u2014 better known as the \u201d granny \u201d \u2014 earned the Hall of Famer the title of one of the greatest free throw shooters of all time. Barry swears by its accuracy, but players hardly ever mistakes it. \u201d I really truly can \u2019 t understand the aversion people have to trying something that could be very effective for them, \u201d Rick says. He holds a minimum free throw rate of 90 percent.",
        "Doctors can save thousands of lives a day if they act promptly to stop sepsis, an often lethal alternative to infection. Sometimes termed blood poisoning, sepsis is the primary cause of death in hospitals. A regulation in New York state compels doctors and nurses to follow a certain procedure, involving a big dose of antibiotics and intravenous fluids. It \u2019 s far from safe \u2014 about a quarter of patients would die from sepsis. But early intervention is helping. \u201d Intervention has to be quick, \u201d said Dr. Howard Zucker, head of the New York State Health Department.",
        "The U. S. military invaded Panama in hot pursuit of the country\u2019s dictator, Manuel Noriega, in December 1989. As he rapidly ran out of options, Noriega took refuge at the Vatican Embassy in Panama City. In deference to diplomatic protocol, U. S. forces did not enter the embassy. But they did concoct a plan to smoke out Noriega, who died Monday at the age of 83. The plan involved music, mostly heavy metal and rock, with a few ballads thrown in. It was blasted on loud speakers, at deafening volumes, around the clock.",
        "Military commander, drug trafficker, CIA informant, dictator, convicted murderer: The strongman Gen. Manuel Noriega wore many labels during his tortuous path to \u2014 and fall from \u2014 the heights of power in Panama. Announcing Noriega\u2019s death at age 83 Tuesday, Panama\u2019s president said it \u201dcloses a chapter in our history.\u201d Panama\u2019s President Juan Carlos Varela announced Noriega\u2019s death via Twitter.

        "At the summit last week, Donald Trump and posed for photo ops with leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Tuesday, however, he had some harsh words for Merkel\u2019s Germany. \u201dWe have a MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany, plus they pay FAR LESS than they should on NATO military. Very bad for U. S. This will change,\u201d he tweeted on Tuesday morning. That \u201dMASSIVE\u201d trade deficit is what we\u2019re going to focus on here. Trump often brings up trade deficits with other countries, but economists say that this is the wrong way to think about trade deficits.",
        "For a few hours Monday, the bitter between a bull and a girl in New York City got a curious, interloper: a tiny pug, with one of those legs suggestively raised beside the girl\u2019s leg. There was no urine, no caustic caption, but it was clear where the dog\u2019s disdain was directed. The statue\u2019s placement by sculptor Alex Gardega marks an odd, if brief, digression in a contentious chapter that\u2019s been unfolding off Wall Street for months.",
        "Renowned sports writer and commentator Frank Deford, 78, died on Sunday, just a few weeks after his last piece aired on Morning Edition. He had recorded 1, 656 commentaries for NPR over nearly 40 years. Deford left everything on the field when choosing topics for his commentaries. One of his early 1980 pieces argued that losing teams didn\u2019t deserve support, and later that year he opined that the Heisman Trophy was \u201dthe second stupidest award given in sports.\u201d In 1992, he told us \u201dtelevision coverage of football is abysmal.",

        "When Ebola erupted in West Africa a few years ago, it was catastrophic. But one good thing emerged from the outbreak: The development of an Ebola vaccine \u2014 a powerful vaccine.

        "has risen to music stardom while playfully disregarding many rules of popular music.

But the music video is also being criticized for portraying a famous young victim of airstrikes in Syria alongside survivors of ISIS bomb attacks. Released at the start of the Ramadan holiday, the video portrays a suicide bomber as he moves toward an attack, and the Arab community that tries to dissuade him.
