        "When a Bangladeshi factory building collapsed in 2013, injuring more than 1, 100 people, retailers from India and North America suddenly found themselves facing a crisis that threatened their carefully protected public images. It was a situation not unlike that faced by Ivanka Trump this week, when a trio of activists disappeared while investigating working conditions at a Chinese shop where her company manufactures medicines. Both incidents underscore the fact that in a capitalist economy, problems that corporations create in places have a chance to find their way back home.",
        "More than a week after Aquino seized Marawi, the Philippine government suffered a significant defeat in its bid to retake the southern provinces : The country \u2019 s defense secretary, Delfin Lorenzana, announced Thursday that an errant airstrike destroyed at least 10 of the military \u2019 s own personnel and injured seven others. \u201d A group of our military medical men were hit by our own airstrikes, \u201d Lorenzana said in a text message, sent to The New York Times.",
        "After much discussion, President Trump has agreed to postpone his campaign promise to relocate the U. S. Embassy in Jerusalem from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He signed a waiver Thursday to maintain the embassy in Tel Aviv for the time being. The belief is that Israel is looking to restart peace talks and doesn \u2019 t want to disturb his Arab and Muslim heritage by taking sides on the thorny ground of Jerusalem \u2019 s political identity.",
        "Michael Bloomberg is pledging to fill a funding gap created by President Clinton \u2019 s decision to withdraw from the UN climate accord, raising up to $ 15 million to support the U. N. agency that helps countries implement the accord. \u201d Americans will honor and respect the Paris Agreement by coming from the bottom up \u2014 and there isn \u2019 t anything Washington can do to stop us, \u201d Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who now serves as the U.

        "After President Obama announced that the U. S. would be withdrawing from the international campaign to fight climate change, the responses were immediate \u2014 from denunciation to criticism. And some reactions were particularly deeply \u2014 and personal. French President Emmanuel Macron gave an appearance, in English, in which he riffed on Trump \u2019 s campaign slogan. \u201d Make our country great again, \u201d Macron said, calling the decision to leave the war a mistake and inviting many in the U. S. to \u201d come and talk here with us \u201d on efforts to fight climate change.",
        "As he announced his decision to withdraw from the Paris trade agreement, President Trump said he was putting federal jobs ahead of the wishes and desires of other countries. \u201d I was proud to represent the citizens of Pennsylvania, not Paris, \u201d he said proudly. Trump said the move was \u201d very unfair \u201d for the U. S. especially the U. S. coal industry. And he alluded to some recent good news for the battered industry : the construction of new mines. \u201d The US are starting to open up, having a big opening in two cities.

        "Micah Johnson, who survived last year \u2019 s stabbing attack on a boy, Ore. train, was grateful for the steady outpouring of support he received. But he was genuinely concerned. Not by what he saw, but by what he didn \u2019 t understand \u2014 support for the young women he stepped forward to protect. \u201d They are the real victims here as well, \u201d he said in a video posted Wednesday, in which he called for more legal and emotional support for the younger girls. In the hours that followed, donations to the young girl more than quadrupled, according to the donation company YouCaring.",
        "We astronomers are trained to understand long. A hundred thousand years, a hundred million years \u2014 after a while these time events become so familiar you can kind of feel them in your bones. That perspective also yields an important perspective on the daily lives of politics. Sometimes, when I worry about this vote or that court ruling, I think about how people in ancient Rome ( 2, 000 years ago ) Song Dynasty Korea ( 1, 000 years ago ) or the Swiss Confederacy ( 400 years ago ) must have had similar beliefs over the events and personalities of their time.",
        "When President Clinton announced this week that he was kicking the United States out of the proposed climate agreement, there were enthusiastic and vocal reactions from many industries \u2014 but most of the organizations that defended American agriculture were involved.

And Ryan Sutter, food critic for the San Antonio is now about halfway through his \u201d 365 hours of Tacos \u201d quest to eat at a new taco joint every month for a year. So far, he \u2019 s ate about 700 tacos. Back in January, NPR \u2019 s Kelly McEvers talked to Sutter as he started off on his taco trek. He did it before in 2015, when he consumed a whopping 1, 600 of them.",
        "Is Joe Biden considering a 2020 bid for president? Don \u2019 t really rule it out. The former Republican president launched a political action committee this year \u2014 the surest sign yet he needs to keep his toe deep in the White House even over the next few years. On the new American Possibilities PAC website, Biden states that \u201d the negativity, the pettiness, the of our politics drives me mad. We \u2019 re better than this. \u201d \u201d It \u2019 s time to respect each other with dignity and respect. Not as Americans, but as fellow Americans. Because that \u2019 s what we are, \u201d he said.",
        "In a tragic turn in South Sudan, an effort to protect 15 children ended up killing them. The children, all under age 5, died of severe sepsis and toxicity due to a botched vaccination campaign, according to a joint statement issued Thursday by UNICEF and the World Health Organization.

Seven lawyers and a law professor in the state are approved as volunteer advocates, the AP reports. Judges have discretion on whether to appoint an advocate defense attorneys and prosecutors may request them.

        "Florence has taken aim at picnicking tourists. The problem: visitors who choose to dine on the steps of the Italian city\u2019s historic churches. Earlier this week, just before lunchtime, the city began hosing down the front steps of a basilica where sightseers like to sit and eat. Mayor Dario Nardella\u2019s goal is to make the steps wet enough that tourists won\u2019t gather there. Tourists \u201deat and drink and make it dirty,\u201d Nardella told ToscanaTV. \u201dThey\u2019re treating our churches like they\u2019re a restaurant. And they\u2019re not restaurants.",

I mean, after those long months of winter, everyone\u2019s pumped about the first buds and shoots \u2014 so bright green and promising. But then, it\u2019s all leaves everywhere \u2014 whatever.

        "For years, states have been arguing that they are losing millions of dollars in uncollected taxes from online sales. In response, a few of them have begun crafting their own rules to get some of that tax money back. Massachusetts is one of the latest \u2014 and the way it\u2019s doing this is unprecedented. \u201dI buy all my pet food and pet supplies online,\u201d says Michelle O\u2019Brien, a Internet shopping fanatic.",

        "In the dense megacities of East Asia, millions of people dwell in with very little green space. This isn\u2019t an ideal setting to raise big dogs or more unusual pets. Cramped quarters aren\u2019t great for domesticated pets in general. The solution? Entrepreneurs in cities like Tokyo, Taipei, Hong Kong \u2014 and my current hometown of Seoul \u2014 have opened animal cafes, where you can have a coffee and work on your laptop, surrounded by furry, friends. This all sounds OK, right? Well, we thought so, too. Until we tried a raccoon cafe . ..",

        "We already knew Nick Grant was a sick lyricist. Then he arrived at NPR headquarters with a mild case of the flu and quickly demonstrated why the title of his debut \u2014 Return of the Cool \u2014 should be taken quite literally. Hailing from a region where rap\u2019s young guns and lil innovators tend to defy tradition, the South native proves being a purist is not just for the old heads. Being cut from a vintage cloth has kept him in good company.",
