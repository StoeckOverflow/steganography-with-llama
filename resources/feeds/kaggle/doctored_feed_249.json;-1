        "President Trump said Sunday afternoon that the violence in London over the year was a \u201d horrific terrorist act. \u201d Trump made the statement at a fundraising gala at Ford \u2019 s Headquarters in Washington, D. C. Four people died Saturday night and dozens more were wounded when a van crossed Westminster Bridge and veered into pedestrians. Three men exited the vehicle and led a stabbing rampage. Police charged and killed the three protesters.",
        "People from New Jersey are used to discovering their state. But, in fact, New Jersey has a history to brag about. Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, the phonograph and the movie set there. Many decades later, Bell Labs developed the transistor in the state. Geography borders New Jersey. On one end, it borders New York City, and on the other end is Philadelphia. That means full access to Wall Street financing, transportation and police headquarters.",
        "It \u2019 s a public health problem that spans the globe. It kills close to 6 billion people a year. Teenagers are at war. It \u2019 s not the latest epidemic or recent disease. It \u2019 s the cigarette. A new report from the Centers for Disease Control looks at prevalence of smoking among to ( most smokers beginning in adolescence ) and how they feel about it, with a nod to the lack of measures that work to raise rates of teen pregnancy.",
        "In the past years, countries including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen and the Maldives have cut ties with Qatar, citing terrorism support. The severance in relations affects maritime transport, trade and \u2014 more crucially for the U. S. \u2014 efforts to unify Arab countries. Qatar is host to the U. S. Central Command \u2019 s world headquarters, and hosts a vital air base for the U. S. coalition against the Islamic State. It remains unclear how or if family members that have severed relations with Qatar will continue to assist in the operations out of that base.",
        "Saudi Arabia and at least four other foreign nations are cutting all ties with Qatar, citing tensions over terrorism and regional conflicts and igniting debate over the rift \u2019 s size among key U. S. allies in the Middle East. Qatar \u2019 s government \u201d expressed deep regret over the Syrian \u201d and said it was the victim of \u201d an instigation campaign \u201d that is meant to hurt the nation. \u201d Such measures are unjustified and are based on baseless and unfounded fears, \u201d the government \u2019 s foreign minister said in a statement.",
        "The hamlet of Sevnica, approximately 5, 000, sits right in the middle of the small, alpine centre of Slovenia, in a green field along the Sava River, bordered by hills. \u201d It \u2019 s really an amazing climate, \u201d chirps Lidija Ogorevc, a tour guide here. \u201d You should try our wine, our salami. \u201d She pauses in front of a building \u2014 not unattractive, but quite closed. \u201d A cultural monument, \u201d she declares. This used to be the place where Amalija Knavs, the mother of Melania Trump, wore children \u2019 s clothes long ago, when Slovenia was still part of Yugoslavia.",
        "Scientists have described a shockingly hot, massive, star that has a tail like a dog. \u201d It is so hot that it is hotter than most objects that we know of out there, \u201d says Frank Gaudi of Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, whose team describes the scorching hot called in the journal Mars. The planet, which is around eight times more massive than Earth, orbits a blue disc about 650 away from Earth. This planet is nearly twice as powerful as our own sun, and this planet whips toward it once every one and a half Earth days.",
        "The Trump Administration is taking steps to approve five energy plants to use seismic air currents for oil and gas production off the U. S. Atlantic coast even though they would incidentally harass marine mammals. Several groups and some coastal groups object. \u201d The testing may take place over a vast area ranging from the Tampa Bay, south to Port Canaveral in Florida, \u201d NPR \u2019 s Jim Brady reports.",
        "Here \u2019 s a classic scene from a telenovela. It \u2019 s the funeral of a very rich businessman whose heirs are taking over his fortune. An indignant woman said to a female guest : \u201d You are disrupting the party. Who else would you be occupying this seat for other than Richard Juma \u2019 s third wife? \u201d Death, marital feuds, mayhem over money \u2014 they \u2019 re part of the plot in one of Kenya \u2019 s most notorious telenovelas, Lies That Bind ( see video in video below ).

        "Babies get little sleep at night and last for shorter stretches when they sleep in their parents \u2019 room after 4 months old, a new patient finds. Parents are much more likely to engage in unsafe sleeping practices, such as bringing their infants into their bed or leaving clothes, blankets or stuffed foods with the baby when the infant enters their room. The findings appear to contradict recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics for safe infant sleep, creating more confusion for mothers trying to choose the safest, yet most practical and realistic, places for their babies to sleep.",
        "Nancy and Frank Gapinski of Glendale, Wis. remember a time when they couldn \u2019 t properly communicate with their own son. \u201d He seems to not really have any kinds of communication with us. He did a lot of echoing things that we said, and scripting from home, \u201d Nancy Gapinski says as she and her children wait for their son Matthew \u2019 s school bus to arrive. \u201d A lot of times people didn \u2019 t know how to respond to him then, and didn \u2019 t know what he was trying to say and conversations wouldn \u2019 t really go away. \u201d But that \u2019 s all changed.",
        "President Trump announced Monday a plan to privatize the nation\u2019s air traffic control system \u2014 a move that would remove the job of tracking and guiding airplanes from the purview of the Federal Aviation Administration. \u201dToday we\u2019re proposing to take American air travel into the future, finally,\u201d Trump said. The nation\u2019s air traffic control system was designed when far fewer people flew, Trump said, calling it \u201dstuck, painfully, in the past.\u201d He also called the system \u201dancient, broken, antiquated\u201d and \u201dhorrible\u201d and said his reforms would make it safer and more reliable.",
        "Updated at 2:20 pm ET President Trump is mounting a vigorous defense of his controversial travel ban, continuing an argument he started over the weekend in response to a terrorist attack in London. That message launched a series of tweets. His uncompromising language could complicate matters for administration lawyers charged with defending the travel ban in court. The tweets also threaten to overshadow a series of White House policy announcements on infrastructure this week. This is not the first time that a carefully choreographed by the administration has been upended by the president\u2019s itchy thumbs.",
        "And then there were three. Apple has finally unveiled its answer to Amazon\u2019s and Google\u2019s smart speakers slash digital assistants \u2014 and it\u2019s called HomePod. This has been one major area in consumer electronics lacking Apple\u2019s footprint. Amazon has heavily dominated the field with its home speaker called Echo, which uses the digital assistant Alexa. Google Home followed in October and Microsoft\u2019s assistant, Cortana, is also finding a home in home speakers.

        "Two months and change after he accepted his Nobel Prize for Literature in a small ceremony in Stockholm, Bob Dylan has delivered his Nobel Lecture, required of all laureates in order to finalize the award. \u201dNow that the lecture has been delivered and made public, the Dylan adventure is coming to a close,\u201d writes Sara Danius, permanent secretary for the Swedish Academy, in a blog post. The lecture, minutes long, finds Dylan contemplating the literary roots of his work and the nature of it, and of song, more elementally.",
        "As horrific as mass shootings are, they are outliers. The vast majority of gun deaths in America are either suicides or shootings. Mass shootings represent a small fraction of deaths by firearm. Still, the premeditated shooting of multiple people is the kind of crime that preys on people\u2019s sense of security, so it makes sense to drill down and take a closer look at those events. The advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety has inventoried all mass shootings between 2009 and 2016, and its data are revealing.",
        "A \u201ddisgruntled employee\u201d who was recently fired from a business near Orlando, Fla. fatally shot five of his former before killing himself on Monday morning, according to local law enforcement.

        "CRISPR, which stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, is the basis for a revolutionary technology that allows researchers to make very precise modifications to DNA. The implications are enormous \u2014 not only for the treatment of disease, but also for genetic engineering and scientific research more broadly. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that CRISPR has been making the news, especially over the last few years, as its applications have become increasingly appreciated and developed.",
        "Wonder Woman was a box office smash on its opening weekend, raking in more than $100 million domestically \u2014 a new record for a movie directed by a woman. Deadline reported Monday that the final tally for the film was $103. 1 million, even higher than the initial Sunday estimates. That handily defeats the previous record for a movie directed by a woman \u2014 $85. 1 million for Sam \u2019s Fifty Shades of Grey. And it compares well to similar movies \u2014 that is, superhero flicks that aren\u2019t sequels or ensemble films.",
        "For more than a decade, the number of women choosing bilateral mastectomy to treat breast cancer has been on the rise. That\u2019s the case even for women with early stage breast cancer, cancer in only one breast or breast cancer, which has raised concerns that women are getting more surgery than they need. Now a study suggests that trend may be turning around. Repeat surgeries including mastectomies declined by 16 percent from 2013 to 2015, after medical groups recommended a smaller margin around tumors removed by lumpectomy. The results were published Monday in JAMA Oncology.",
        "As farmer Jon McConaughy wades through his flock of 400 sheep, lambs bleat, seemingly saying \u201dmaaaaa\u201d as they look for their mothers in the huge pasture. \u201dBetween seven and 10 lambs a week is what we use,\u201d McConaughy says, looking across the field. \u201dThat\u2019s what goes through the slaughterhouse.\u201d McConaughy\u2019s Double Brook Farm in Hopewell, N.

        "The last time we saw singer Monica Martin at the Tiny Desk she was singing with Phox, her folky, poppy band based in Madison, Wisconsin. But, while that band is on hiatus, Martin took time to walk into the world of Violents, the project of pianist, string arranger and songwriter Jeremy Larson.

        "Southeast Alaska is known as the Panhandle: It\u2019s a long, narrow strip of mainland coastline, plus 1, 000 islands and the braided waterways that surround them. In most places, there are no roads connecting the communities there, so Alaskans depend heavily on ferries: the Alaska Marine Highway System. The ferries connect 35 communities in all, and not just in the southeast: The routes stretch for 3, 500 miles, from Bellingham, Wash. in the south, all the way to Dutch Harbor, Alaska in the west, far out on the Aleutian Island chain.",
        "America\u2019s sprawling elections infrastructure has been called \u201da hairball\u201d \u2014 but as people in Silicon Valley might ask, is that a feature or a bug? Director James Comey touted it as a good thing \u2014 \u201dthe beauty of our system,\u201d he told Congress, is that the \u201dhairball\u201d is too vast, unconnected and woolly to be hacked from the outside.
