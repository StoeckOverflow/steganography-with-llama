Reuters estimates that May will win 314 seats, short of the 326 needed for a majority in the Parliament, according to opinion polls released after polls ended Thursday.

        "Zika is a scary disease because of the terrible birth defects it can cause. Now scientists have a stronger sense of the size of that virus. The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention examined 2, 549 pregnant women with the Zika syndrome in Puerto Rico and other U. S. territories between Jan. 1, 2016 and June 25, 2017.

        "At almost 72, onetime husband Lee Hayden feels the afflictions of age : loneliness, a demanding career, dwindling sexual magnetism, and the belief that his relationship with his daughter is unsalvageable. Also, he might be dying. It \u2019 s a painful diagnosis that compels the lackadaisical Lee ( James Elliott ) to focus on the important issues in The Hero, a ruefully sad drama that observes a few moments of his existence. But it \u2019 s a younger woman, unsurprisingly, who reenergizes him.",
        "Law Enforcement agencies announced on Thursday a litany of charges against 33 people \u2014 including 27 who were allegedly associated with a Russian crime syndicate. Authorities said the indictment represents one of the biggest federal racketeering charges ever brought against a vor v zakonei \u2014 a Russian phrase that translates roughly as \u201d. \u201d That vor is identified as Razhden Shulaya, 40, living in Edgewater, N.

        "Manal \u2019 s path to activism began simply writing : In 2011, the Saudi woman shot herself driving a car, then posted the video to YouTube. Ordinarily such a behavior might not get much notice, but because it \u2019 s not socially appropriate for women to drive in Saudi Arabia, where there is a de facto ban, Sharif \u2019 s videos went viral. Sharif describes driving as an act of civil disobedience : \u201d For me, driving \u2014 or the need to drive \u2014 is not only about moving from A to Q it \u2019 s a way to emancipate women, \u201d she added. \u201d It gives them so much power.",
        "John Major of Manhattan Beach, Calif. epitomized the Southern Californian. The retired psychologist was a mountain runner, a cyclist and an accomplished outdoorsman, says his daughter, Julie Minor. \u201d He and my mom were both friends of the Sierra Club, \u201d Minor says. \u201d They went on sort of backpacking trips, you know \u2014 climbing mountains and trekking through the desert. He was just a very ordinary person. \u201d But in the autumn of 2014, he fell ill with terminal lung fibrosis, a lung disease that his son says slowly destroys his quality of life.",
        "Provocative new evidence suggests that fetuses have the ability to discern faces when they \u2019 re still in the womb. A study examining fetuses found they were more likely to appear on a pattern of lights that resemble a human face than on the same pattern configured to look nothing like a face. While the results seem to be confirmed by experiments, some scientists who were not involved in the experiment felt the findings are a significant advance in understanding early eye sight development.",
        "Updated at 9 : 30 p. m. on June 20, Former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Wei testifies in front of the House Judiciary Committee Wednesday afternoon. It \u2019 s the first time in a while that the Intelligence committee, and not its Senate predecessor, will be in the headlines. The Senate Intelligence Committee dominated news headlines \u2014 and TV coverage \u2014 over the past few weeks as it opened hearings featuring Major General Jeff Sessions, former FBI agent James Comey, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, amongst others. But during that period, the Senate Intelligence Committee has dominated its work, too.",
        "As a group of research scientists prepared to fly a plane in Hawaii that would take them back safely to China, U. S. special agents found edible seeds in their luggage. Those seeds are likely to land at least one scientist in Chinese prison. Agriculture generally is a business, but as that technology has expanded, so has the temptation to take shortcuts and share trade secrets that might unlock huge numbers. The FBI calls agricultural economic espionage \u201d a major threat \u201d and some are worried that biotech piracy can cause big trouble for a large and growing U. S. economy.",
        "In the West African country of Burkina Faso, nearly 50 percent of children do not attend school. The reported cost of getting them there would be close to $182 million, and yet the small, francophone country received only $17 million in education aid in 2012. This comes from a new policy paper released this week by UNESCO\u2019s Global Education Monitoring Report, which found that the countries most in need of education funds aren\u2019t getting them.",
        "During Ramadan, refraining from even a bite to eat is a challenge, but what about a month of daylight hours without anything to drink? \u201dAfter a long day \u2014 especially in summer \u2014 of fasting, one becomes more thirsty than hungry,\u201d says food blogger Amira Ibrahim. \u201dSo when it is time to break your fasting day, everybody rushes to the drinks.\u201d \u201dThe basis for [fasting from] drinking and food is the same,\u201d explains Imam Adeel Zeb, interfaith scholar and Muslim chaplain at The Claremont Colleges.",
        "It\u2019s tricky to nail down exactly what makes someone feel like a \u201dracial impostor.\u201d For one Code Switch follower, it\u2019s the feeling she gets from whipping out \u201dbroken but strangely colloquial Arabic\u201d in front of other Middle Easterners. For another \u2014 a Native American woman \u2014 it\u2019s being treated like \u201djust another tourist\u201d when she shows up at powwows.",
        "Updated at 12:30 p. m. ET Thursday, A is trying to put a story about a newspaper reporter behind him. Greg Gianforte has apologized in a letter to The Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs, saying Jacobs was just \u201ddoing his job\u201d in asking a legitimate question when Gianforte knocked him down. The apology is part of a deal that the future congressman struck with Jacobs. \u201dJacobs agreed not to pursue a civil claim in exchange for Gianforte donating $50, 000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists,\u201d Montana Public Radio\u2019s Eric Whitney reports.",
        "The Cleveland Cavaliers came into the third game of the NBA Finals in a dispiriting but familiar position after two Golden State blowouts. Last year, that led to one of the most stunning comebacks in NBA history, That remained a possibility the entire game Wednesday night \u2014 until the closing minutes, when the Warriors ripped the Cavaliers\u2019 hearts out. Now Cleveland, which last year became the first team to recover from a Finals deficit, faces historically long odds again.",
        "This week, the podcast and show Invisibilia examines the nature of reality, with a Silicon Valley techie who created apps to randomize his life, a psychologist who trains herself to experience the world like dogs do and a wildlife biologist who thinks bears aren\u2019t dangerous. In San Francisco, the life Max Hawkins lived was arguably perfect. He was employed by Google, surrounded by friends and had his routine nailed down.",

Noses are the unsung feature of the face, sunscreened or surgically fixed, but rarely exalted. And the sense they enable, smelling, is likewise uncelebrated. Regularly voted the \u201dsense I\u2019d be most willing to lose\u201d olfaction is largely ignored \u2014 unless it brings word of something savory or foul nearby. But we are born smellers.",

When you live in northern Minnesota, wildlife is usually no big deal. A giant bull moose casually strolled through our neighborhood in Duluth a couple summers ago, past screaming and kids at a nearby park. Wolves also have ventured into town, occasionally killing dogs that strayed too far from their owners.",

        "Steve Earle has always kept at least a foothold in his outlaw country roots, but he\u2019s seldom embraced them as explicitly as he does on So You Wannabe an Outlaw. Over the past couple of years, Earle\u2019s been enmeshed in specialized projects \u2014 the 2015 bluesman\u2019s holiday Terraplane Blues and 2016\u2019s duo album with Shawn Colvin.",
        "The Trump White House had been considering Robert Mueller as a top candidate to lead the FBI before the deputy U. S. attorney general changed course and tapped Mueller to serve as special counsel investigating Russian interference in last year\u2019s election, two sources familiar with the process told NPR. Mueller had gone so far as to meet with Justice Department leaders and White House officials about the FBI job, which opened after President Trump fired Director James Comey on May 9.",
        "A confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill this week raised eyebrows when the questioning turned to theology \u2014 specifically, damnation. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont pressed Russell Vought, nominated by President Trump to be deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, about his beliefs. \u201dDo you think that people who are not Christians are condemned?\u201d Sanders repeatedly asked, challenging that belief as Islamophobic. Christian organizations have denounced Sanders\u2019 questioning as amounting to a religious test for public office \u2014 one that would disqualify millions of people. Polls show about half of all Christians in the U. S.",
        "NPR journalists David Gilkey and Zabihullah Tamanna died a year ago this week, ambushed on a remote road in southern Afghanistan while on a reporting assignment traveling with the Afghan National Army. Since their deaths, NPR has been investigating what happened, and today we are sharing new information about what we learned. It\u2019s a very different story from what we originally understood. The two men were not the random victims of bad timing in a dangerous place, as initial reports indicated.",
        "President Trump said Friday he would be willing to testify under oath about his interactions with former FBI Director James Comey, whom he fired in May. The president said Comey\u2019s testimony on Thursday before the Senate Intelligence Committee mostly vindicated his previous claims about their interactions. \u201dFrankly, James Comey confirmed a lot of what I said \u2014 and some of the things that he said just weren\u2019t true,\u201d Trump said in his first remarks following Comey\u2019s testimony.",
        "President Trump has broken the silence he maintained during former FBI Director James Comey\u2019s testimony Thursday, saying on Twitter that he was vindicated in the hearing that explored Russian meddling in the U. S. election, its ties to Trump\u2019s security adviser, and Trump\u2019s dealings with Comey. \u201dDespite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication. ..and WOW, Comey is a leaker!\u201d the president tweeted early Friday morning. In referring to Comey, Trump was citing the former FBI director\u2019s acknowledgment that he had asked a friend to leak his memos about his conversations with the president.",
        "Updated at 11:05 a. m. ET, Ordinary people often get into legal trouble in response to desperate circumstances. Politicians, however, seem to make the worst trouble for themselves when they are riding high and carrying all before them. Thus the most famous political scandals of U. S. history have happened not when presidents or members of Congress had their backs to the wall but when their sails were filled with a favorable wind.",
        "Updated at 7:28 p. m. ET, Former FBI director James Comey may have done more damage to Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday than even President Trump, whom Comey publicly accused of waving him off part of the Russia investigation. Comey said he expected Sessions to recuse himself from the Russia investigation weeks before he did because of reasons that are classified. That does not comport with Sessions rationale when he announced his recusal in early March. Sessions has been the subject of scrutiny over his failure to disclose meetings with Russian ambassador to the U. S.",

So far five bald men have been killed, all in central Mozambique: two in May in Milange district close to the border with Malawi and three this month in the district of Morrumbala. Bald men across the country are afraid of exposing their scalps. Some stay indoors. Others hide their baldness with caps.
