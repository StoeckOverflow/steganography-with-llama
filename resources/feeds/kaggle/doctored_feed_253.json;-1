After calling a snap election in April in anticipation of a referendum, she ended up with an electoral vote wreck, in which her Conservative majority actually lost its electoral majority. It now holds 318 seats. Clinging to power, May hoped the Tories would form a minority government with the Democratic Progressive Party of Northern Ireland, which won 10 seats. \u201d What the country deserves more than ever is certainty, \u201d she said.",

        "You probably still want to hear you \u2019 ve been denied. If you \u2019 ve heard those words, you imagine they feel like a kick in the gut. Now, imagine that instead of your boss telling you face to face, you get the answer from a alert on your smartphone. That \u2019 s how it works at Uber. Eric Huestis didn \u2019 t realize that, until it happened to him. At first, there was nothing unusual about that night in April. He took his number 300 to a Burlington, Vt. car shop. He bought the used truck specifically to drive for Uber.",

        "Every so long, brightly lit American comedies set in Gold Coast mansions will slip in five minutes of banter between a Latina housekeeper and her wealthy white liberal worker. Mild joshing ensues about the cluelessness or prejudice of the employer, often with a roll of the maid \u2019 s paper thrown in. That done, everyone slips back into their respective slots in the social pecking order. Point taken, but not done. Beatriz at Dinner, a new feature between director Miguel Arteta and producer Mike White ( The New Girl, Chuck Berry, among others ) is not that banter or that novel.",

Grant \u2019 s unrivaled blend of charm, good looks and silliness \u2014 he hadn \u2019 t a shred of pomposity or elitism \u2014 made him a Hollywood star everyone thought.

        "A recent report from Save the Children documents what many people have known for a long time \u2014 a baby is far better off being born in Europe than in Africa. It\u2019s a point that has been made before. \u201dBut it\u2019s important that Save the Children and others keep bringing it up and putting it before the public because it can be forgotten, ignored or passed over amidst the news of the day,\u201d says Robert Black, the director of international programs at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.",
