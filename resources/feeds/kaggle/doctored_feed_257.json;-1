        "Three months before the Dallas Street Chorus leaves for New York, its traveling members are listening and listening intently to music director Jonathan Palant. He delivers an announcement about yet another more phase of preparation : haircuts at 12 : 45 for anyone who wants one. When you \u2019 re seeing singers who are homeless for a week at Carnegie Hall, arrangements have to be particularly thorough. Unfortunately, a glance around the neighborhood at the Dallas Stew Pot \u2014 the city \u2019 s animal shelter and the choir \u2019 s performance spot \u2014 quickly see that no one in the Street choir appears offended.",
        "When it comes to work, Late Night creator Seth Meyers is clear about what interested him in : \u201d I got into it because it looked like the most fun job in the world, \u201d he says. \u201d And it has not led me astray. \u201d though, Meyers \u2019 resume is packed with questions. Before taking over the reins at Saturday Night, he spent 13 months at Saturday Night Live, first as a performer, then as chief writer and the alongside Amy Poehler, of the show \u2019 s \u201d Weekend Update \u201d segment.",
        "In the fall of 1974, George Foreman and Muhammad Ali reunited in the country of Zaire, now called the Democratic Republic of Congo, for the legendary boxing match known as \u201d The Rumble in the Jungle. \u201d Although the Rumble had to be postponed until later that autumn, a huge promotional event came on as scheduled and turned out to be particularly momentous : Zaire 74, a music festival where some of Africa \u2019 s greatest black athletes played alongside Congo \u2019 s leading talent to an attendance of tens of thousands.",
        "The director of Flint \u2019 s Department of Health and Human Services, Nick Wells, has been charged with involuntary manslaughter and misconduct in control over the Flint water disaster. Both are felonies in Michigan. The state \u2019 s chief medical executive, Dr. Eden Wells, will be charged with obstruction of justice. Four other employees, including the former hospital emergency manager and deputy director of public health, were also charged with involuntary manslaughter. Williams and Wells are the state legislators to be charged in the crisis. The charges stem from an investigation launched by Michigan \u2019 s attorney general. \u201d Mr.",
        "The gray seal population in New Hampshire has bounced back, and reliable data points to how high seal numbers are doing. White seal numbers had been decimated for more than a century when the Marine Mammal Protection Act was passed in 1972. The animals were located in New England, and as research has reported, Massachusetts even paid a bounty of $ 5 each. Although it has been clear that the population has dropped in number, it has been difficult to pinpoint just how much.",
        "It \u2019 s morning service time at Our Place Family Services, a day hospital for adults with disabilities, housed in a small concrete and glass building on Lovers Street in Slinger, Wis. About 30 people are gathered here, around a long table, reciting the oath of allegiance. One woman paces alongside the table, others sits in a wheelchair a few yards away. There \u2019 s a woman holding a baby in her lap and a hot dog \u2014 a goldendoodle \u2014 wandering around greeting people with a sniff and a kiss.",
        "Worries about whether her parents can still get the medical care they need are still far from Dawn Johnson \u2019 s mind. It \u2019 s a constant, pressing concern. Much of her money is a direct result of education in Texas. To qualify for Medicaid in the USA, most children must come from families with incomes at or below 138 percent of the national poverty level. In 2017, that \u2019 s $ 33, 948 for a family of four.",
        "Listening to SZA \u2019 s new solo album, Ctrl, is like slipping into a dream. Filled with her silvery hair, electronic production and an unabashed openness about her experiences in life \u2014 she \u2019 s woman trying to balance relationships and life with herself \u2014 SZA \u2019 s songs feature interviews with Kendrick Lamar, Travis Barker and Isaiah Rashad. ( There \u2019 s also the sound of phone calls with her father and grandmother, used as interludes throughout the album. ) As many have reported, there was a ( very recent ) time when SZA chose to leave music.",
        "Jeff Sessions did exactly what he needed to do Tuesday \u2014 help himself in the eyes of his ally, President Trump, and, in part, help Trump. The attorneys general, an early Trump supporter, revealed nothing in the congressional hearing about the Trump Russia saga or Trump \u2019 s role in possibly failing to quash the investigation looking into it. Following vague legal guidance, Sessions shut down certain important lines of public questioning \u2014 and that may be exactly how the White House handles it.",
        "Attorney General Jeff Sessions went before the Senate Intelligence Subcommittee Tuesday, fiercely denying he did nothing wrong in speaking twice with the Russian ambassador to the U. S. during President Obama \u2019 s 2016 campaign and also infuriating Russia by refusing to detail any conversation he has had with the president. The hearing lasted about 2 hours and included a series of testy exchanges. Here are the highlights : 1. \u201d An appalling and detestable indictment \u201d Similar to former CIA Director James Comey, who testified before the same committee last Thursday, Sessions came out late to defend himself.",
        "Updated at 8 p. m. ET on Wednesday. Search and rescue crews are fighting a blaze and searching for victims who may have been trapped in a Victorian building in London that was caught in fire overnight. At least 12 people have died from the blaze, twice the original estimate, and that number is expected to increase further, The Associated Press reports. The fire burned uncontrolled for weeks. By 11 a. m. ET, the fire had been controlled but the building continued to smolder.",
        "More than 190 Democrats in Maryland joined together to advise President Trump on trial in the U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia. They say Trump is violating the U. S. Constitution by profiting from business transactions involving foreign arms \u2014 and doing so without congressional approval. And they want the court to make it stop. Trump has \u201d severely and flagrantly violated \u201d the Constitution \u2019 s Emoluments Clause, Dr. Richard Blumenthal,. told reporters on a conference call.",
        "When Leo Varadkar assumed power in Ireland on independence, he blazed a trail of firsts : At 38 years old, the biracial son of an Indian peasant father and Irish mother became the country \u2019 s taoiseach, or prime minister. He also became the first openly religious man elected to govern the Republic of Ireland, where homosexuality was illegal until just 24 years ago. Now, as newly elected leader of the ruling Fine Gael party, Varadkar has delivered his first speech to Parliament and received his oath of office from the country \u2019 s President, Michael D. Higgins.",
        "When it comes to seafood, we\u2019re awash in labels. There are labels to identify sustainable wild, farmed or Fair Trade fish. We\u2019re able to scout the canned tuna section for lingo like \u201dpole and line caught.\u201d And plenty of us use Seafood Watch\u2019s green, yellow or red system to help us avoid a side serving of guilt with our fish supper. But there\u2019s another designation many consumers look for in proteins like beef, poultry and pork that is largely missing from the conversation about seafood: humane treatment.",
        "If it seems like there\u2019s an explosion of TV coming at you this summer, that\u2019s because there is. And it\u2019s a trend that\u2019s been building for quite a while. Back in the day \u2014 say five or 10 years ago \u2014 summer was a time of experimentation and slowing down. Network TV aired shows that would keep the lights on while reserving its best stuff for the fall, and cable TV took advantage by debuting more new shows as an alternative. These days, that playbook has blown up \u2014 at least a little bit.",
        "The Australian government has agreed to a $53 million settlement with 1, 905 people who were held at a refugee detention camp on Manus Island, Papua New Guinea. It\u2019s one of the largest human rights settlements in Australian history. The Manus Island camp, an facility, has for years been blasted by rights groups for its conditions. The detainees party to the lawsuit were held there at various times between November 2012 and May 2016, and say they suffered from negligence and false imprisonment.",
        "From Cara Cara oranges to clementines, California\u2019s farmers deliver novel navels, mandarins and tangelos. But the state\u2019s growers have watched with worry as the devastating disease known as citrus greening has crippled Florida\u2019s citrus industry. It\u2019s a threat not just to California\u2019s orange industry, but to the collection of rare, wild and heirloom varieties used to breed new crops that the U. S. Department of Agriculture currently \u201dstores\u201d in the state. This collection of varieties is grown in plots and greenhouses in places like Riverside or the Coachella and Central valleys.",
        "Tracy K. Smith knows many readers are intimidated by line breaks. She knows people don\u2019t like identifying consonance, assonance or alliteration. But Smith \u2014 the newly announced 22nd Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry of the United States \u2014 wants to help America push past that anxiety. \u201dWhat do you hear? What do you feel? What does this remind you of?\u201d she asks NPR. \u201dThese are all real and valid reactions to a poem.\u201d The poet laureate is appointed by the librarian of Congress and fills the role for a year.",
        "Updated at 1 a. m. Friday ET, The sun danced and dipped through a bright blue sky over Nationals Park Thursday night, leaving a warm still evening in its wake. \u201dWhat a beautiful day for baseball,\u201d blared a voice over the loudspeakers, after Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u201dGlory Days\u201d faded out, and John Fogerty\u2019s \u201dCenterfield\u201d finished, too. Even so, a poignant and immovable shadow cast itself over Thursday\u2019s annual congressional baseball game. Rep.",
        "The Wednesday shooting at a Virginia baseball field that critically wounded Louisiana GOP Rep. Steve Scalise and at least four others shook Washington. Members of Congress were breaking into tears talking about the event. But the violent outburst, while shocking and distressing, was not a complete surprise threats and aggression toward members of Congress have gotten a lot of press in recent months, notably at town events. And especially related to the health care debate. There was a lot of talk in the immediate aftermath of the shooting about political polarization, specifically the vitriol aimed at politicians.",
        "Uber is a mess \u2014 the \u201dbad boy\u201d ethos shattered, a nervous breakdown in its place. This week, the CEO announced he is taking a sudden leave of absence. A former U. S. attorney general released a brutal audit of the startup\u2019s culture. It\u2019s a terrifying moment for many investors who want that $70 billion unicorn to make them rich or richer \u2014 not implode. But there is one Uber investor who stands out for how she decided to speak up.",
        "After surgery to treat her epilepsy severed the connection between the two halves of her brain, Karen\u2019s left hand took on a mind of its own, acting against her will to undress or even to slap her. Amazing, to be sure. But what may be even more amazing is that most people who have surgery don\u2019t notice anything different at all. But there\u2019s more to the story than that. In the 1960s, a young neuroscientist named Michael Gazzaniga began a series of experiments with patients that would change our understanding of the human brain forever.",
        "Updated at 6:37 p. m. ET, Less than a month after President Trump hired an outside lawyer to deal with inquiries related to the Russia investigations, Vice President Pence has followed suit. Pence\u2019s office confirms he has hired Richard Cullen, who served as U. S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia during the term of George H. W. Bush and later worked on George W.

        "Esraa Yousria Saleh was walking down El Hussein, a busy street in downtown Cairo famous for its souvenirs and tchotchkes, when a man in his early 20s made eye contact with her. He followed her, circled her, then suddenly \u2014 she felt a hot breath in her ear: \u201dI would like to put it all inside.\u201d Saleh, 28, a feminist and activist based in Egypt, was furious. Why did that man feel like he could look at her? Follow her? Say those lewd words to her? A May study from Promundo, an international research group, and U. N.",
        "About 20 percent of baby food samples tested over a period had detectable levels of lead, according to a new report from Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit group. The group evaluated data collected by the Food and Drug Administration from 2003 to 2013. This included 2, 164 baby food samples. They found 89 percent of grape juice samples, 86 percent of sweet potatoes samples and 47 percent of teething biscuits samples contained detectable levels of lead. \u201dThe levels we found were relatively low, but when you add them up \u2014 with all the foods children eat . ..",
        "At the United States Penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pa. prisoners with serious mental illness are handed crossword and sudoku puzzles instead of counseling, according to a lawsuit that says prisoners at one of the most violent federal prisons are denied routine mental health care. The lawsuit also alleges that prisoners at Lewisburg are cut off from the medications they were given at other prisons and housed in small cells, where they often spend up to 24 hours a day with other prisoners, who also often have serious mental illnesses. Filed on June 9, McCreary v.",
        "The success of Pixar\u2019s Cars series can be chalked up to a great many things, but don\u2019t discount the little frowns the cars make with their dashboard eyes when they want to go fast. When Lightning McQueen, the Owen stock car with the bright flames decal, guns for pole position, he squints so much that any human who might be driving him wouldn\u2019t be able to see the road.",
        "Kate McKinnon plays an Australian in Rough Night, a shrewd of bro comedies like Bachelor Party, Very Bad Things, and The Hangover. There\u2019s no particular reason for her to play an Australian, beyond a thin running joke about cultural insensitivity of failing to distinguish between Aussies and Kiwis. And yet it\u2019s funny. McKinnon merrily swishes her dialogue around the accent and makes her character\u2019s jet lag and misunderstanding to keep her a beat behind the action, like the caboose of the comedy train.",
        "Partisans on either side of Northern Ireland\u2019s \u201dTroubles\u201d will naturally gravitate to one of The Journey\u2019s two principals: Republican Martin McGuinness or Unionist Ian Paisley. But for those watching at a certain distance \u2014 from across the Atlantic, say \u2014 the movie is as much a clash of acting styles as a political debate. Playing McGuinness, Colm Meaney emphasizes warmth, humor, and naturalness. As the older and chillier Paisley, Timothy Spall is more mannered, relying on such gear as false teeth that make his occasional grin even more menacing than his frequent scowl."
