Monterey Pop set the pattern for all the huge rock festivals that would follow \u2014 Beatles, Coachella, Bonnaroo and all the rest \u2014 and its influence eventually spread even further via a documentary, Monterey Pop, that was helmed by D. A. Pennebaker and would set a gold standard for concert storytelling.",

        "The title of Maile Meloy \u2019 s last novel is misleading : Do Not Become Alarmed sounds like a suspense story. Granted, I did read it in two nights but, while I \u2019 m a unapologetic fan of thrillers, Meloy \u2019 s novel is something darker, something trickier to characterize. I \u2019 d call it a very powerful work of literary criticism that exposes how very thin the layer of bad luck is that keeps most of mankind from falling into the abyss.",

        "Some conservatives have seized on Wednesday\u2019s shooting of Republican Rep.

To put this in perspective, there were only 172, 000 cases reported globally to the World Health Organization for all of 2015.
