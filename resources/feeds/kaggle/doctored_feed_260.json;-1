The latest segment in the Public Theater \u2019 s Walk in the Park series is Black Sunday \u2014 presumably bringing an end to demonstrations outside of the Delacorte Theater but unlikely to quell the long debates over exactly whom is opposed to free speech, under what rules and over the limits of artistic expression. Those debates are not likely to subside, even as the appetite for creative artists tackling an array of political topics continues to grow.",
        "Donkeys have been loyal beasts of burden for 5, 000 years, although they still don \u2019 t get a lot of respect. In the wild, burro herds are a nuisance. In captivity, they can be mistreated. But in recent years, donkey sanctuaries have popped up across the country. The best among them is Peaceful Valley Donkey Sanctuary, outside of San Angelo, Texas, where the air pollution erupts with the unpeaceable sounds of donkey braying. Just like its so everything about the donkey is species specific. Their temperament \u2014 wise, cautious and playful \u2014 is unique in the equine world.",

Yet Ethiopia has the world \u2019 s largest collection of donkeys. It has 7 million of the animals \u2014 outstripping the No. 2 donkey nation, China, by about a million. And life can be pretty tough for a European donkey. On a recent trip to China, I saw one donkey scratching mightily while pulling a cart.

District Court has agreed to take up an appeal over electoral rights in Wisconsin after a lower court ruled that the state \u2019 s law constitutes an \u201d unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. \u201d It \u2019 s the first time in more than a decade that the nation \u2019 s highest courts will take up the issue of unlawful gerrymandering, or drawing voting districts with the aim of strengthening one political party. And it gives the court an opportunity to first determine a metric on what constituted unlawful gerrymandering, which could have potential implications for the way congressional districts are drawn in other states.",

Worldwide, there are nearly 1. 7 billion cases of diarrhea each year. The disease caused an estimated 1. 5 million deaths in 2012, according to the latest data from the World Health Organization. But it\u2019s both preventable and treatable \u2014 if more people understood the underlying causes. What is diarrhea? Three or more loose or watery bowel movements within a day.",
