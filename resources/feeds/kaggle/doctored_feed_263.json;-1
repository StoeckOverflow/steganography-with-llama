        "Updated at 2 : 32 p. m. ET, Senate leaders unveiled their health insurance overhaul proposal on Thursday. The Senate bill, titled the \u201d Better Care Reconciliation Act, \u201d would repeal various parts of the Affordable Care Program, also known as Obamacare. The legal outlines of it look a bit like the House measure, the American Health Reform Act, which was passed in May. It rolls back the ACA \u2019 s Medicaid Act \u2014 making for deep budget cuts to that program, inconsistent with current law.",

Dean Heller on Congress became the latest GOP lawmaker to raise concerns about the Senate aged care bill \u2014 a bill that further complicates Republican efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Bill. \u201d I cannot support a version of legislation that takes disability insurance from tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Nevadans, \u201d Heller said at a news conference back in Nevada.",

The Federal Communications Commission has issued a $ 120 million fine for a Seattle resident said to be responsible for almost 97 million robocalls over just the last three months of 2016. Officials made Adrian Abramovich hundreds of thousands of phone calls to landlines and cellphones in the U. S. and Canada and at one time even overwhelmed an emergency medical paging service.

        "Renee Rabinowitz, a Holocaust survivor in her 80s, was flying from Newark, N. J. to Tel Aviv in 2015, when a flight attendant on Israel \u2019 s El Arab airline asked if she might be willing to change back. An Jewish man had said he did he not feel comfortable sleeping next to her. Rabinowitz agreed to comply. But afterward, she said she faced \u201d deep humiliation \u201d \u2014 and sued the airline in Israeli soil.

        "A federal district court has upheld a unanimous court ruling that the confession of Brendan Dassey, whose confession was part of the Netflix animated series Making a Murderer, was involuntary. Dassey was found guilty of helping his son kill a young girl in 2005, and has been held in a Wisconsin court. The case against Dassey was constructed largely on that confession, in which he stated that he intends to rape and kill a victim named Teresa Halbach, as The has happened. A panel from the 7th U.

        "Throngs of mourners paid their final respects to Otto Warmbier Thursday at a public funeral at the elementary school he attended near Cincinnati. Just four weeks ago, Warmbier graduated from the university as the salutatorian. The University of Virginia employee was detained in North Carolina for 17 months and died on Monday, shortly after he returned to the United States in a coma. \u201d It doesn \u2019 t quite feel real good, \u201d his former soccer player Grady Beerck said, according to The Associated Press. \u201d He \u2019 s so beautiful, and he \u2019 s been gone for so long.",
        "For the first time in more than four decades, the Yellowstone grizzly bear is set to lose its ecological protections under the Endangered Species Act.

        "Women in their 40s at low risk for breast cancer should talk to their health care provider about the risks and outcomes of mammography before starting regular screening at that age, according to statements released Thursday by the Boston College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The group had earlier recommended annual mammograms starting at age 40. But the advice has failed to better incorporate input from the woman being screened, citing physician Christopher Zahn, former president of practice development at ACOG. \u201d A patient \u2019 s preferences and interests need to be an important aspect \u201d of the decision, he says.",
        "A naturalized U. S. citizen should not have been stripped of her citizenship for the obvious reason that she lied to U. S. officials, the Supreme Court ruled Thursday, vacating a unanimous court \u2019 s decision. The judge, an ethnic Serb who entered the U. S. as a refugee, had decided that false answers she made to immigration officials were immaterial to procuring citizenship. \u201d We have never read a decision to strip citizenship from people who met the legal requirement for acquiring it, \u201d Justice Michael Kagan wrote in the court \u2019 s decision.",
        "Bad Boy Records and its founder, Sean \u201d Diddy \u201d Combs, helped shape much of what we take for granted in music culture : Bigger is better, working for money and power is nothing to be ashamed of, everybody wants to be a millionaire. The new documentary Can \u2019 t Wait Won \u2019 t Stop, available on Universal Music June 25, relates the label \u2019 s story around a concert that reunited some of its stars last year. We love Combs for grandiosity \u2014 we know him by his stage names, P. Diddy and Puff Daddy. Nobody \u2019 s heard Bad Boy \u2019 s records.",

        "Tim Mueller has grown corn and soybeans on 530 acres around Columbus, Neb. for decades, but now he is starting to take a huge gamble. The new Costco is building a new factory in Fremont, Neb. about an hour away from Mueller \u2019 s property. The company plans to sell 2 million birds every week.

        "One of Earth \u2019 s most efficient systems is the eggs. Eggs evolved over 300 million years ago as vertebrate animals adapted to living on land. And since then, they \u2019 ve taken on numerous forms, especially among reptiles. Biologists have long wondered why there are so many shapes, and what determines each shape. Hummingbirds, for example, have eggs called Tic Tacs. Birds called murres produce eggs shaped like big teardrops. Some eggs are more like pingpong balls. Now, an international coalition of scientists believes it has solved the mystery of the eggs. Biologist James Caswell Stoddard of Princeton University leads the team.",

The first you have to find shade to touch your phone is the way the light reflects off the screen. The shade reduces contrast, blocking out images. And so \u201d the lower the light reflection, the better, \u201d Professor Wu, a professor of optics and photonics at the University of Central Florida.

        "Note: NPR\u2019s First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the Spotify or Apple Music playlist at the bottom of the page. Beach House has spent 13 years and six albums perfecting a hazy sound that\u2019s as versatile as it is enduringly, endearingly simple. Victoria Legrand and Alex Scally make brooding, deliberately paced music that still sparkles and sweetens in surprising ways \u2014 a contradiction summed up by the title of one of Beach House\u2019s best records, Depression Cherry.",
        "Thanks to Sigmund Freud, we all know what it means to dream about swords, sticks and umbrellas. Or maybe we don\u2019t. \u201dFor 100 years, we got stuck into that Freudian perspective on dreams, which turned out to be not scientifically very accurate,\u201d says Robert Stickgold, a sleep researcher and associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. \u201dSo it\u2019s only been in the last 15 to 20 years that we\u2019ve really started making progress.\u201d Today, most brain scientists reject Freud\u2019s idea that dreams are highly symbolic representations of unconscious (and usually sexual) desire.",

Alexandria, Va. and San Francisco during the first two weeks of June \u2014 two of them on the same day \u2014 have once again put America\u2019s complicated relationship with guns in the spotlight.

        "The United States is still a home for everyone the proof is that a Muslim living in suburban Illinois can make a prayer rug joke and have it feel fully, unmistakably American. In The Big Sick, when aspiring comedian Kumail Nanjiani leaves the Chicago stage, he often dines with his Pakistani parents in their where they expect him to do his full five minutes of prostrating before they can all dig into their biryani. But Kumail, like many a disaffected member of his generation, has soured on the concept of religion.",
        "The premiere of John Cage\u2019s composition \u201d4\u201933\u201d\u201d in Woodstock, New York in 1952 stirred some measure of the outrage that greeted Stravinsky\u2019s \u201dThe Rite of Spring,\u201d only here the audience was upset by the notes they didn\u2019t hear, instead of the ones they did.

        "While Clint Eastwood was busy playing a wounded Union soldier held at the pleasure of a bevy of Southern belles in Don Siegel\u2019s 1971 Civil War drama The Beguiled, the actor also found time to direct his first film, Play Misty for Me, in which he also starred as a disc jockey stalked by an unhinged female fan. Both films were visceral articulations of male paranoia about the sinister potential of repressed or oversexed women. Imagine such fighting talk in the hands of a woman filmmaker whose aesthetic draws heavily on the world of fashion.",
        "One of Mali\u2019s most celebrated singers, Oumou Sangar\u00e9 began her career as an outspoken champion for the rights of women. On her 1989 debut, Moussolou, she offered sharp critiques of practices such as arranged marriages and polygamy, drawing on her own experiences growing up in a polygamous household. Sangar\u00e9\u2019s irresistible voice enhances her music\u2019s power to disarm critics and make defenders of outmoded traditions think twice. She is often referred to as the Songbird of Wassoulou \u2014 the name of a region in Mali\u2019s forested south and also the name of a musical style Sangar\u00e9 has helped define.",
        "When faced with allegations of sex abuse against one of its bishops, the Church of England \u201dcolluded and concealed rather than seeking to help those who were brave enough to come forward,\u201d the church\u2019s leader acknowledged Thursday. \u201dFor the survivors who were brave enough to share their story and bring Peter Ball to justice, I once again offer an unreserved apology,\u201d Justin Welby, archbishop of Canterbury, said in a statement.",

They had spent weeks, if not months, preparing themselves.",
        "Planet Earth is a vast place, with humans scattered all over it. But how we\u2019re distributed is far from even.

This year\u2019s count means the world added roughly 1 billion people over the last dozen years. It will take 13 years to add the next billion, according to the report.

        "Oh sure, you could argue there are other, more important things happening in the world. And frankly, you\u2019d be right. (For those things, by the way \u2014 which some people, in somber tones, might call news \u2014 please see here.) But sometimes, you just need to watch a big gorilla dance in a small pool.
