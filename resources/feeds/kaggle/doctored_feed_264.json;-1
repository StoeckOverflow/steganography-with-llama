Now, Canadian neuroscientists with the University of Toronto are challenging that concept. In a paper published monthly in the journal Neuron, they review the scientific research into the neurobiology of forgetting and hypothesize that our patients purposefully work to forget information in order to help people live our lives. I agreed with Blake Richards, editor of the of the paper, who applies artificial intelligence theories to his study of how the brain learns.",

And, in addition to activities around the election, special counsel Robert Mueller is reportedly now also looking into possible obstruction of justice by the president.
