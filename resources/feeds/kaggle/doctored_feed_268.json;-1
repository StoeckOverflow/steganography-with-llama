        "What we eat and how we make our food tells a lot about who we are, where we \u2019 ve come from and what we care about. Our culture also connects us to other people \u2014 family and friends with whom we share our meals. That \u2019 s why our dinner dishes often build up strong memories of people we love. Over the next month, NPR \u2019 s The Salt and Goats and Soda Foundation are teaming up to present six live cooking videos.

        "A hundred years ago this month, President Woodrow Wilson enacted the Espionage Act to deal with charges against the U. S. in World War I. Historically, the most notorious U. S. spy cases have been filed under the act, like the trial against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were convicted in 1951 of giving war secrets to the Soviet Union and executed two years later. But prosecutions have been relatively slow and limited almost solely to spies \u2014 until recently.",

        "Is music an anchor from the world or the key to it? Over and over, when we started considering the best days of the first half of 2017, time seemed to intrude, whether in pieces that echoed headlines or lyrics that spoke individual truths too far drowned out by that other, noisier machine.

        "Climate scientists agree that this century is getting much warmer and that such warming will likely bring economic pain to the U. S. but economists aren\u2019t sure how much. Now, a team of scientists and economists, writing in the upcoming issue of the journal Science, says it can at least tell which parts of the country are likely to suffer the most.

        "Big as a Buick and with a buck like a bronco, the giant gray pig named Okja is a force to be reckoned with. She was born in a lab \u2014 well, two labs. In the context of Bong \u2019s new film Okja, the pig belongs to a nightmarish food conglomerate, an obvious Monsanto which ships her to a small family farm in South Korea as part of a calculated effort to make genetically modified food less scary to the public. If people empathize with their mutant pigs, the company reasons, they\u2019ll eat them without questioning their origins.",

That company, Bayer, states on its website that \u201dno adverse effects to bee colonies were ever observed in field studies at exposure conditions.\u201d Bayer will have a harder time making that argument after today.
