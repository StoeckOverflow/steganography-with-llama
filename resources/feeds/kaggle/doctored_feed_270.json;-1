        "Editor \u2019 s Notes : This story was first printed in December 2014. The first time I ever got tipsy was during a champagne toast at a cousin \u2019 s wedding reception. All was good, until the room started spinning \u2014 and the thought of my cousin \u2019 s bride lying in her wedding dress was just a whirl of energy. Of course, if you \u2019 re an uninitiated teenager, any trace of alcohol can go straight to your head. But, decades later, bubbly wine still starts to hit me faster than, say, beer. It turns out there \u2019 s a way.",
        "In 2015, the selfie rage did not taper. And we learned something interesting about the \u201d body form, \u201d as some might say it. It appears to be dominated, and driven, by women. The five most famous people on Instagram are women. Kim Kardashian ( ranked No. 2 after Taylor Swift ) came out with the first page dedicated to selfies ( hers ). And a debate brewed over what the selfie says about females.",
        "Elephants \u2019 ability to perceive what is called infrasound \u2014 sound waves with frequencies too low for birds to hear \u2014 has been known about for decades. But recently, a new feature in elephants \u2019 infrasound detection was reported \u2014 and now it has been caught on film. In a report published in October 2014, biologist Michael Garstang and colleagues showed that African elephants equipped with GPS devices were unable to move toward thunderstorms 150 kilometers away. Garstang, et al.",
        "The natural habitat is abuzz with the sound of animals communicating \u2014 crickets, birds, even grunting insects. But scientists learning to decode these noises say the secret calls of African elephants \u2014 their strange rumblings \u2014 are among the most intriguing discoveries any animal makes. William Payne, the same biologist who introduced song in the calls of humpback whales in the 1960s, went on to help run the Elephant Listening Project in the Central African Republic in the 1980s. At the time, Payne \u2019 s team was hiding in shacks in a dense jungle guarded by hundreds of rare black elephants.",
        "At the outset, biographer Jane Purnell didn \u2019 t know much about Clementine Churchill. \u201d I confess, like much of others, I had absolutely no idea who Winston Churchill \u2019 s mother was, \u201d Purnell tells NPR \u2019 s Peter Inskeep. But then Purnell stumbled onto a note from 1940, when Churchill had just become prime minister. It was the middle of World War II, and Churchill was in a very bad state. \u201d She concluded that he was in danger of losing one of the very people he needed most, \u201d Purnell argues. \u201d He was being brusque and rude and rather overbearing. So, she wrote him this letter.",
        "Health insurers in many big cities will draw some pain out of doctor visits in 2016. The plans will offer medical visits to primary care doctors in their networks. You got that right. Doctor visits without copays. Or coinsurance. And no expensive deductible to pull off first either. In Chicago, Chicago, Dallas, Miami and more than a dozen other markets, doctors seeking coverage through the news exchanges can choose medical plans providing free doctor visits, a situation once considered unthinkable.",
        "How does a film conjure the unfathomable vastness of reality? How can it make moviegoers feel the harshness of a desolate wilderness? These are some of the challenges director Gabriel Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu ( Birdman ) faced in creating The Revenant, a revenge thriller that features Leonardo DiCaprio as a fur trapper who \u2019 s been left for dead. After a little while, maybe maybe 10 seconds into the movie, you realize that there \u2019 s only so much a director can do to capture the scope of the forbidding American West in winter. The shots all look alike.",
        "An director, a big star, a survival drama that makes Heart of Gold look like a fishing cruise... and all anyone needs to talk about is the bear trap. And in fact, it \u2019 s hard not to sit there. It comes about comes 24 hours in. Hugh Glass, portrayed by a hirsute, Leonardo DiCaprio, has helped his Indian trappers escape a harrowing Arikara massacre. In most movies that would be the scene everybody \u2019 s talking about \u2014 arrows piercing vocal cords in death raining down from Mt.",
        "It may be some kind of cosmic sign \u2014 or even just cruel irony \u2014 that only a few seconds after a video clip of Aretha King performing a rousing rendition of Carole King \u2019 s \u201d ( You Make Me Feel ) Like a Natural Woman \u201d on CBS \u2019 The Kennedy Center Honors broadcast goes viral, Aretha \u2019 s closest love rival in the Natalie Theater, has left this mortal place. And on New Year \u2019 s Eve, no less.",
        "This was a year for American solar power. It \u2019 s booming across the country. But as more homeowners make their own energy, electric utilities are losing less money, and that \u2019 s moving up their business model. Utilities in two states \u2014 California and Oregon \u2014 are handling the growth of power in dramatically different ways. Matt Brown also got solar panels on his Oakland, Calif. home, but it \u2019 s falling out right now \u2014 his panels aren \u2019 t connected. So Brown \u2019 s appliances are built on electricity he \u2019 s buying from his business, Pacific Gas Station.",
        "Washington state has released an estimated 3, 200 new felons early \u2014 but not due to sentencing regulations. State officials believe the early releases have been made by accident for more than 12 years because of a computer glitch. \u201d Approximately 3 percent of all jail inmates since 2002 were released earlier than allowed by law, \u201d said Nick Smith, the governor \u2019 s general aide, talking about a flaw in the software Washington state uses to calculate prison sentences.",
        "When a poor person is hit with a sudden catastrophe \u2014 maybe, an earthquake or a tsunami \u2014 the government is quick to send assistance. But a disaster, the kind that unfolds over weeks or even months, is another story. There are no immediate, immediate TV images, no bad headlines. And that means it \u2019 s extremely tough for aid agencies to raise the money yet. Just ask John Ford. He \u2019 s the head of the aid organization Save the Children, and he \u2019 s watching a disaster unfold in Ethiopia as the country remains largely intact.",
        "Michael Oxley, a former Republican congressman from Ohio, died this morning at 71. His family says his death was the result of lung cancer \u2014 though they add that he was not a smoker. Rep. Oxley\u2019s name is plenty familiar to anybody who works in finance. The Act of 2002 governs almost every aspect of a company\u2019s financial reporting and accounting practices, and people in the industry often complain about the cost of complying with all the reporting rules. Some say SOX \u2014 as the act Oxley with Sen. Paul Sarbanes, .",
        "Last year, snowpack across the Sierra Nevada was just 5 percent of average. Up and down the West Coast in fact, the season was marked by late openings, early closings and some resorts not opening at all. This year\u2019s strong start will be good news for farms and cities down the mountain later, but it\u2019s especially promising right now for people like Andy Wirth, the resort\u2019s CEO. He took over in 2011, a record snowfall year, only to be followed by three dry years and then last year, the driest in 1, 200 years.",
        "The wastewater treatment plant in Grand Junction, Colo. takes in 8 million gallons of raw sewage \u2014 what\u2019s flushed down the toilet and sinks. Processing this sewage produces a lot of methane, which the plant used to just burn off into the air. The process was \u201dnot good for the environment and a waste of a wonderful resource,\u201d says Dan Tonello, manager of the Persigo Wastewater Treatment Plant. Now, using more infrastructure, the facility refines the methane further to produce natural gas chemically identical to what\u2019s drilled from underground.",
        "A shooter has opened fire in downtown Tel Aviv, killing two Israelis and wounding others, hospital officials said. Daniel Estrin told our Newscast unit that police are searching for the gunman. Here\u2019s more: \u201dHospital officials say two Israelis died of their wounds, 2 are in serious condition and one is in light to moderate condition. The shooting took place at what is being described as a bar or restaurant in central Tel Aviv on a busy weekend afternoon. Israeli media are broadcasting footage of shattered windows and a pool of blood on the pavement.",
        "popcorn oil is in high demand at Oasis Foods, a manufacturer of cooking oils, mayonnaise and other products that restaurants and distributors often purchase by the ton. \u201dWe get a rush this time of year with all the at the holidays,\u201d says Duke Gillingham, president of Oasis, at his factory in Hillside, N. J. just west of Newark Liberty Airport. The company\u2019s health insurance coverage is not as popular as its popcorn oil. Oasis offered health insurance to all employees for 2015, to comply with a new Affordable Care Act mandate.",

        "Oklahoma City residents woke early New Year\u2019s Day to a magnitude 4. 2 quake. Earlier this week, a magnitude 4. 3 quake struck the same area. The state isn\u2019t historically known for earthquakes, but NPR\u2019s Nell Greenfieldboyce told our Newscast unit that Oklahoma \u201dhas recently seen a dramatic rise in seismic activity.\u201d Here\u2019s more: \u201dIf you think of a U. S. state associated with earthquakes, it\u2019s probably California. But really, you should think Oklahoma. In 2015, Oklahoma hit an high, with more than 800 quakes of magnitude 3 or greater.",
        "What\u2019s the universe made of? It\u2019s a question that\u2019s been bothering scientists and philosophers for millennia, and has become even more vexing in recent decades, as physicists have become convinced that most of the universe is made of something we can\u2019t see or touch or measure. At least not yet. Richard Gaitskell hopes to change that. He\u2019s a physicist at Brown University, and the leader of a team that aims to be the first to describe this mysterious dark matter. So, if they can\u2019t see or touch or measure dark matter, why are they so sure it exists?",

        "Iran appears to be racing toward a major milestone in the nuclear agreement reached this summer with six world powers: \u201dimplementation day.\u201d It\u2019s a term with no fixed date, but it will be a big deal when it arrives. It\u2019s the day when the United Nations Security Council lifts the financial and banking sanctions against Iran, and more than $100 billion in frozen assets will be freed up. But the day can only happen when international inspectors confirm that Iran has taken a number of steps to shrink and open up its nuclear program.",
        "In 2014, Charlotte Wheelock and her husband, Nick Hodges, were hoping to find a new start. Struggling to raise their two young children, they left their home in Albuquerque, N. M. and struck out for Seattle to find better jobs. But before they could get established there, Nick was hospitalized with spinal stenosis \u2014 a condition that left him temporarily paralyzed below the waist. Soon, they found themselves without a place to live. \u201dI remember sleeping in the car while you\u2019re in the emergency room,\u201d Wheelock tells Hodges, on a recent visit with StoryCorps.",
        "We get so many books in the mail \u2014 hundreds every week \u2014 that we can\u2019t read them all, and sometimes all we can do with a book is say hey, that looks interesting, and file it away on the shelf. That\u2019s what happened to Anita Anand\u2019s book Sophia: Princess, Suffragette, Revolutionary, which was definitely the One That Got Away from me this year. I put it aside with vague good intentions, and then I forgot about it \u2014 until Princess Sophia ended up in the news.",

        "One thing we\u2019ve learned here at Goats and Soda is that the world of global health and development is swimming in acronyms. We try not to use them in the blog because let\u2019s face it, dear readers, if you saw a story about NGOs (nongovernmental organizations) trying to improve BHS (basic health services) you\u2019d probably click over to a video of RCC (really cute cats). Global health and development acronyms do have their defenders. They are a convenient shorthand for people who work in the field. Although not everyone is a fan.",
        "With the New Year comes a long list of new laws taking effect across the country. In some cases, those laws show states moving in starkly different directions on polarizing issues \u2014 especially voting and gun rights. Here are four examples of controversial laws taking effect now that 2016 has arrived: Starting this week, North Carolinians are required to show photo ID at the polls. It\u2019s the most controversial part of a set of changes to the state\u2019s voter registration laws that were passed more than two years ago. Republican Gov.",

Martin in a lengthy blog post published in the wee hours Saturday. The author had hoped to publish the sixth installment of his massively popular fantasy book series, A Song of Ice and Fire, early in 2016 \u2014 which meant finishing and submitting the manuscript to his publishers before the end of 2015.

        "It\u2019s getting harder and harder to find quality special education teachers, which is why 49 out of 50 states report shortages. Why? It\u2019s a tough sell. Even if you\u2019re up for the low pay and noisy classrooms, special education adds another challenge: crushing paperwork. This is something I understand first hand. You see, I was a special education teacher and I just couldn\u2019t hack it. Though I\u2019m somewhat ashamed to admit it, I only lasted a year in the classroom. I chose special education for what felt like the right reason."
