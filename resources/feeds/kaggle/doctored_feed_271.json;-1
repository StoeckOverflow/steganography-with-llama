        "Russians remained enthusiastic travelers after the Soviet Union broke up, and two of their most cherished winter getaways were the sunny regions of Egypt and Turkey. But those things are now and Russia \u2019 s sagging economy and lost currency are also making many at home. Just a year ago, ads for luxury travel packages were broadcast on Russian television. Antalya, on Turkey \u2019 s Mediterranean coast, was a perfect spot for Russian travel, with warm, sandy beaches of a kind that are hard to miss in Russia.",
        "Former Gov. Bill Bumpers, a veteran of the U. S. Senate who rose to national prominence in part because of his passionate admiration of President Bill Clinton, has died. The Democrat from Maine was 90 years old. Bumpers died Friday night in Castle Rock, according to a staff statement published by the Democrats.",
        "# NPRreads is a weekly story on Twitter and on The. The premise is simple : Correspondents, editors and producers from our newsroom discuss the pieces that have kept them together, using the # NPRreads hashtag. Each weekend, we share some of the best stories. I was still in Denver when I saw this whole feature story in The Denver Post. There have been so many stories about football players and concussions stories, but this one drew me in because it was not about concussions \u2014 but was mostly about the other effects of that kind of concussion sport.",
        "I \u2019 m often asked for medical advice by patients, family members, even new acquaintances : What about this diet? What should I do about this symptom? What about this medication? People are usually skeptical when I don \u2019 t share their enthusiasm about the current health fads. Members of my community, in particular, are often underwhelmed by my medical advice. I \u2019 ll be the first to learn that I don \u2019 t always do a great deal of conveying why I \u2019 m skeptical about the newest information technology, reports of the latest health news and fashions and even people \u2019 s symptoms.",
        "Early Thursday morning last month, Amrik Singh Bal, 68, was standing along a stretch of highway in Fresno, Calif. waiting for a ride to Fresno. Two white buses pulled up beside him, hollering obscenities out their windows. The Fresno Bee said that Bal, who is Sikh, has a white face and was wearing a blue turban, tried crossing the street to walk away when the men in the vehicle pulled a and drove into him, sending him to the ground. They got out, threw punches into Bal \u2019 s face and throat, then sped off into the morning air.",
        "Famous people can be hard to live up to. Those who see them are born with expectations, as well as advantages, and the sons and daughters of famous people have to admit their mistakes and learn their craft under a lot of watchful eyes. When we talked with Natalie Cole in August of 2013 ( you can listen to the entire story below ) she had just recorded an album of Hawaiian language music, as her grandmother had, in the 1950s. Natalie Cole reminds us that when she started out on a musical career, she avoided any harm to her father.",
        "Talking about grief and the loss of a loved ones isn \u2019 t typically dinner time. Many people, including those struggling to cope with death, will avoid talking about such diverse topics, especially over lunch. But a fledgling nonprofit designs dinners designed for young adults to sit together and talk about their relationship with loss. In cities across the country, the group The Conservative Party advises and on how to arrange these meals. Some say it \u2019 s one of the biggest ways that young adults, often skeptical of traditional religion, are connecting to greater meaning in their lives.",
        "When East Harlem \u2019 s emergency medical center gets called to rescue a man with a severe nosebleed, it \u2019 s a serious case. The patient rides woozily out to the ambulance from a tan van on a street. Anthony Savoy, the head medic, calls Savoy to University Hospitals, which has the closest operating room. Savoy tries to make sure the ambulance has space for the patient. The doctor gets in that day, but it was by no means guaranteed. For years, it \u2019 s been common practice for University Hospitals to restore its status to diversion.",
        "The question of assimilation has been on my mind a lot lately. Even in this great country where individuality is inevitable, our current obsession with assimilation for those seeing the U. S. as their new generation seems like a huge paradox. Consider the Russian composer, pianist and conductor Sergei Rachmaninoff. When he moved to America in 1918 he would not let go of returning to his mother country. Together with the house he bought six years later in New York, he tried to recapture the glory of a beloved country club owned by his relatives.",
        "You \u2019 re probably still digesting the best music of 2015, but now that the company has officially turned over, it \u2019 s important to look ahead. To gain a glimpse at some of the highlights 2016 will have to offer, NPR Music \u2019 s Mark Thompson recently commissioned NPR \u2019 s Michel Martin to survey a few forthcoming recordings.",
        "Washington State has released an estimated 3, 200 state felons early \u2014 but not due to sentencing rules. State officials say the early releases have been held by accident for more than 12 years because of a computer glitch. \u201d Approximately 3 percent of all prison inmates since 2002 were released earlier than allowed by statute, \u201d said Nick Johnson, the governor \u2019 s general secretary, talking about a flaw in the software Washington state uses to reduce prison sentences.",
        "Harlan Ellison is America \u2019 s weird guy. He \u2019 s the angry, elderly person at the table \u2014 the one who, for days before dinner, everyone talked about. Is he coming this year? Is Harlan gonna be there? They ask because they \u2019 re afraid Harlan is always missing something. But they \u2019 d also be angry if he wasn \u2019 t there. Ellison is old now, but Harlan hasn \u2019 t dimmed his anger or taken the edge off his humor. He \u2019 s our curmudgeon. He \u2019 s family.",
        "President Obama reading mean tweets about himself. The man who surprised his wife by turning their home into a giant fire pit. The \u201d nae nae \u201d dance. These are the videos that made Americans smile, gawk and shake a leg in 2015. And what about the rest of the world? It \u2019 s much of the same \u2014 but with a new twist. Thanks to Video Rewind, an official list of the world \u2019 s most popular videos on YouTube, we know that in 2015, the Senegalese had their own dance craze : the \u201d na goore. \u201d In Indonesia, Korean dance was all the rage.",
        "A militia in eastern Oregon grabbed national headlines Saturday when members broke into the headquarters of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. There the armed group remains Sunday, occupying the federal building in protest of what it sees as government overreach on rangelands throughout the western United States. \u201dWe stand in defense,\u201d Ammon Bundy, the group\u2019s apparent leader and spokesperson, told Oregon Public Broadcasting. \u201dAnd when the time is right we will begin to defend the people of Harney County, [Ore.",
        "A small group of armed occupied the headquarters of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Burns, Ore. on Saturday. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports that the men were apparently led by Ammon Bundy.

Militia members marched in support of Dwight Hammond Jr. and his son, Steven Hammond, two ranchers who were convicted of setting federal lands on fire.",
        "DNA from a genetically modified goat, a spritz of perfume, sculptures so small you need a microscope to see them. They\u2019re all headed for the moon. The MoonArk is a sort of portrait of humanity, with more than 200 artists and designers contributing to it. There\u2019s space reserved for it on one of the Moon missions competing for the Google Lunar Xprize. Lowry Burgess, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and the MoonArk project lead, holds up one of his contributions, a vial full of red liquid. A drop will go in the Ark.",
        "Updated 6:20 a. m. ET Sunday, Angry over the execution of Shiite cleric Sheik Nimr by Saudi Arabia, protesters stormed parts of the Saudi embassy in Tehran Saturday night before being cleared out by security forces, NPR\u2019s Peter Kenyon reports. Videos posted online appeared to show a Molotov cocktail being hurled through a window at the embassy and flames flaring up, Kenyon says.

        "Back in 2012, President Obama took executive action to create a program for unauthorized immigrants who entered the U. S. as children before June of 2007, and who are currently younger than 34. That program has come to be known as DACA \u2014 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \u2014 and since it was instituted, it has temporarily protected almost 700, 000 people from deportation. How long the original DACA program lasts, though, will depend on who wins the 2016 presidential race.",
        "As part of a series called My Big Break, All Things Considered is collecting stories of triumph, big and small. These are the moments when everything seems to click, and people leap forward into their careers. Normally, Alex Honnold tries to avoid breaks of all kinds. As a professional rock climber, Honnold has made his name climbing some of the tallest, most difficult rock faces in the world, many of them without the safety of a rope \u2014 and entirely alone.

        "The beginning of a new year is a busy time for new singles. According to the websites Match. com and PlentyOfFish, Jan. 3 is the busiest day of the year for new signups to their sites. But those are just two in the plethora of dating apps and websites. There are big names like Tinder, OkCupid and Hinge. But there are lots of niche apps that target specific groups.

        "About a decade ago, food writer Michael Pollan issued a call to action: Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. As 2016 opens, it looks like many American cooks and diners are heeding that call. Vegetables have moved from the side to the center of the plate. And as another year begins, it appears that plants are the new meat. Bon Appetit magazine named AL\u2019s Place in San Francisco the best new restaurant of 2015.",
        "Rabbi Reuven Birmajer finished teaching his Talmud class at a religious seminary in Jerusalem last week, and then told his students he had to rush home. Deliverymen were bringing a new bed. \u201dHe was afraid a Palestinian guy was going to deliver the bed, and his wife was going to be all alone,\u201d explains student Chaim Zbar. But it was the rabbi who was killed in a Palestinian stabbing on his way home. Now Zbar avoids going out in the streets.",
        "Food coloring, water, a preservative and a pound of morphine powder. These are the ingredients in Dr. Anne Merriman\u2019s recipe for liquid morphine. \u201dIt\u2019s easier than making a cake,\u201d says Merriman, a British palliative care specialist who founded Hospice Africa in Uganda in 1993 and helped design the formula that hospice workers in Uganda have used for 22 years to craft liquid morphine. The lightest dose, dyed green to indicate the strength and to make sure people don\u2019t confuse it with water, costs about $2 per bottle to make. Stronger doses are dyed pink and blue.",
        "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is dismissing a terrorist propaganda video that uses part of one his stump speeches. \u201dThey use other people,\u201d he told CBS\u2019 Face the Nation in an interview aired today. \u201dWhat am I going to do? I have to say what I have to say. And you know what I have to say, there\u2019s a problem.\u201d Of course, this comes after the Islamist group released a recruitment video aimed at American Muslims.",
        "A year ago, NPR\u2019s Weekend Edition met four Howard University seniors. Ariel Alford, Taylor Davis, Kevin Peterman and Leighton Watson gave us a peek into life on the precipice of adulthood. Now they\u2019ve arrived. Alford has spent the past few months as a student teacher in Washington, D. C. finishing her final requirement before getting her degree. Davis stayed in Washington too.

        "challenge: Each of the following sentences has two blanks. The first word has the letter O somewhere in it. Double the O to get the second word, which completes the sentence.

        "In Spring Hill, Tenn. people often lurk outside the library on their laptops \u2014 before it opens and after it closes. Librarian Jennifer Urban says it\u2019s not that they\u2019re just mooching the free . The cost may be one aspect, but this town of about 30, 000 people is also growing fast, she says, so fast that Internet providers can\u2019t keep up with home construction. \u201dThere are subdivisions here that no one in the subdivision has Internet access, for one reason or another,\u201d she says. So the city decided to start offering something new: mobile hot spots, for lease.",
        "These are dark times our feeds are filled with news of shootings as well as the hateful speech that always results. Every year, writing this preview, I think of how poetry is one of our surest consolations. It can\u2019t do much about the fear and violence running rampant in America right now, but in the books to be published in 2016 especially, poets are taking responsibility, speaking out, identifying themselves, speaking the truth.",
        "President Obama is announcing a series of executive actions intended to combat gun violence, including a regulatory change designed to make it harder for gun buyers to avoid background checks. Obama plans to detail the moves on Tuesday with a statement in the White House East Room.",
        "The Paris agreement to curb climate change calls for a dramatic shift away from fossil fuels and the greenhouse gasses they emit, especially carbon dioxide. Switching to renewable energy helps, but that won\u2019t happen fast enough to keep temperatures from rising to dangerous levels. That\u2019s why scientists and researchers all over the world also are working on new ways of keeping carbon out of the atmosphere. NPR\u2019s Jeff Brady, KQED\u2019s Lauren Sommer, Wyoming Public Radio\u2019s Stephanie Joyce and Inside Energy\u2019s Leigh Paterson tracked down a few examples of this in North America."
