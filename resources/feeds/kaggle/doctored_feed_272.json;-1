        "One of the many success stories of the past couple of decades can be seen in your cereal bowl. Since 1998, the Food and Drug Administration has required that breakfast cereals, breads, cookies, pasta and other grain products topped with enriched flour come naturally with folic acid. When consumed by mothers before and during early pregnancy, this extra vitamin plays a vital role in preventing minor brain and spinal fluid defects. Thanks to protein fortification, the number of babies born in the U. S.",
        "In a Middle East already aflame, a fresh conflict between Saudi Arabia and Syria threatens to complicate almost every major issue from the Russian nuclear deal to the Libyan civil war to international oil markets. These are all U. S. priorities, and the Obama administration finds itself staring at another Middle Eastern conundrum. White House spokesman Michael Earnest on Monday called on Trump and Saudi Arabia to take restraint and offered sharp criticism of both. His language adds to the difficult position facing the administration. If the U. S.",
        "Saudi Arabia \u2019 s execution of leading Shiite cleric Nimr on Friday sparked a violent uprising at the Saudi Embassy in Iran \u2019 s capital, Tehran. Saudi Arabia then quickly cut ties with its longtime Persian rival. As the broader Middle East reacts to the dramatic deterioration in relations between the two countries, which have long been strained, here \u2019 s a look at who Nimr was. The cleric was an active critic of the Saudi state, calling for more rights for the country \u2019 s marginalized Shiite community.",
        "One month after Saudi Arabia \u2019 s flag was set on fire in Bahrain by protesters, Saudi Arabia Bahrain has cut relations with Iran and given Saudi diplomats 48 hours to leave the country.

        "militants move to hold the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge near Columbus, Ore. as law enforcement troops keep their distance. But they say they \u2019 re willing to leave if local residents ask them to, says Public Broadcasting Stations. For three days, this new armed group has stormed the federal building to find Dwight and Steven Hammond, who had been convicted of arson on federal property and served short sentences. Those sentences were extended by a Judge who said they were too brief. The state sheriff says the Hammonds have turned themselves in to serve the extended term.",

Service dogs are often trained to handle veterans with physical disability. Now, a growing number are being trained to meet the demand from vets with developmental disorder and other mental health issues. Those dogs need extra tricks \u2014 how to find a house for intruders, for example, so a man feels safe.",
        "Several GOP presidential candidates are starting to read out their closing messages in a fresh round of campaign broadcasts airing in Iowa and New Hampshire this week. The ads come ahead of the early February primaries in those states. They show a dark and fearful mood, with footage and news stories highlighting the recent terror attacks in San Diego, Calif. and Paris. Donald Trump \u2019 s campaign, in its first ever ad, begins with praise of President Obama and Bill Clinton, followed by footage of the San Bernardino police laid over police cars.",
        "Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is trying to screw up his foreign policy ambitions by ripping into some of his Republican supporters. He did not blast any of his opponents online by name, but in a speech in Hooksett, H. H. Monday morning, Rubio took some veiled shots at Sens. Ron Paul and Ted Cruz. Rubio questioned their national security qualifications, and he specifically gave aim at Cruz for defeating Syrian President Bashar Assad.",
        "When she first announced that California \u2019 s new gun law was signed, Ms. Carin van Zyl was relieved to discover that assisted death might be an option for her if she ever faced it herself. But as a palliative care doctor at the University Of Southern California Keck School Of Medicine, she \u2019 s worried the experience might lead people to consider lethal death over other options that may help accommodate their wishes. \u201d Patients die as though their choices are between untreated abortion or suicide, \u201d she told NBC \u2019 s Renee Montagne.",
        "Namala Mkopi always wants to be a pediatrician. He doesn \u2019 t know exactly who or what employed him. He just wanted \u201d to treat everyone. \u201d And nothing would get in his way, not even death. \u201d It wasn \u2019 t my thing, \u201d he admits. \u201d I always really liked biology. \u201d Today, at age 38, he is a pediatrician and an advocate for child health in his native Tanzania.

        "Volkswagen \u2019 s implementation of a \u201d defeat device \u201d to fool U. S. regulators has resulted in a criminal lawsuit against the company. Volkswagen has acknowledged that millions of its passenger cars worldwide depend on a ruse to skirt emissions controls. The civil complaint was heard in federal court in Detroit, with the Department of Justice filing on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency \u2014 which says it hasn \u2019 t quite reached an acceptable compromise with Volkswagen over how to handle a lawsuit. The carmakers \u2019 vehicles were actually driving up to 40 times more pollution into the atmosphere than is allowable under U.",
        "When you hear about government abuses on the Korean peninsula, the conversation usually focuses on North Korea. But also, the North \u2019 s democratic neighbor, South Korea, is constantly drawing international criticism for how its government is dealing with dissent. In November, 60, 000 people showed up in South Seoul for a mass protest against President Park raising \u201d a gamut of ongoing concerns about freedom of expression, freedom of information, freedom of peaceful, free protest, \u201d says Ian Robertson, deputy deputy director of Human Rights Watch.",
        "Diagnoses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are up around 30 percent compared with 20 years ago. These days, if a won\u2019t sit still for circle time in preschool, she\u2019s liable to be referred for evaluation, which can put her on track for early intervention and potentially a lifetime of medication.

        "If you hail a ride using the app Lyft, that car could one day be . On Monday, Lyft announced a new partnership with General Motors, which is pumping half a billion dollars into the software startup and joining the board. One of the things they\u2019re doing is planning to build an autonomous fleet. They haven\u2019t released a specific timeline on when, though in the future, when you call the car service, the vehicle likely won\u2019t have a human driver. But it will have options, like or TV.",
        "For now, they\u2019re known by working names, like ununseptium and ununtrium \u2014 two of the four new chemical elements whose discovery has been officially verified. The elements with atomic numbers 113, 115, 117 and 118 will get permanent names soon, according to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. With the discoveries now confirmed, \u201dThe 7th period of the periodic table of elements is complete,\u201d according to the IUPAC. The additions come nearly five years after elements 114 (flerovium, or Fl) and element 116 (livermorium or Lv) were added to the table.",
        "Losing your ability to think and remember is pretty scary. We know the risk of dementia increases with age. But if you have memory lapses, you probably needn\u2019t worry. There are pretty clear differences between signs of dementia and memory loss. After age 50, it\u2019s quite common to have trouble remembering the names of people, places and things quickly, says Dr. Kirk Daffner, chief of the division of cognitive and behavioral neurology at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. The brain ages just like the rest of the body.",
        "There\u2019s growing evidence that a lack of sleep can leave the brain vulnerable to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u201dChanges in sleep habits may actually be setting the stage\u201d for dementia, says Jeffrey Iliff, a brain scientist at Oregon Health Science University in Portland. The brain appears to clear out toxins linked to Alzheimer\u2019s during sleep, Iliff explains. And, at least among research animals that don\u2019t get enough solid those toxins can build up and damage the brain.",
        "This weekend, Facebook\u2019s \u201dMemories\u201d reminded me of a post from Jan. 2, 2009: \u201dTania Lombrozo is generating New Year\u2019s resolutions. ..that look a lot like last year\u2019s.\u201d I could, unfortunately, post the same again today. In fact, one of my resolutions for 2015 \u2014 to be smart about my smartphone \u2014 was shared here last year on 13. 7, and I can report pretty imperfect success. I\u2019m surely not alone in failing to achieve my resolutions: How many people resolve to eat healthier diets and to exercise more regularly, year after year?",

        "North Korea announced on state television that it tested its first hydrogen bomb. The announcement followed a magnitude 5. 1 earthquake that shook near the rogue nation\u2019s nuclear test site, at 10 a. m. local time. The hydrogen bomb test was \u201dan act of self defense\u201d against foreign threats, the announcement from the North said. \u201dWe\u2019ve joined the rank of nations with nuclear weapons. We won\u2019t use the nuclear weapon as long as there\u2019s no invasion of our autonomy.\u201d If verified, this would be North Korea\u2019s first nuclear test since 2013. It has staged two previous tests before that.",
        "There\u2019s something of a tactical vibe at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, where a group of armed men have taken over buildings to protest federal control over public land in the West. The men who have blocked the driveway address each other on their radios with code names such as \u201dInfidel\u201d and \u201dRogue,\u201d and talk about maintaining \u201dOPSEC\u201d \u2014 or \u201doperational security.\u201d One of the men, who won\u2019t give his name, says if law enforcement shows up, it\u2019ll show up big. \u201dYou\u2019ll know when it happens because you\u2019ll hear the helicopters,\u201d he says.",
        "Over the past few days, you\u2019ve probably heard a lot about Cliven Bundy. His son is presently occupying a federal building with other armed individuals in Oregon. But Bundy first made national news in 2014 during a standoff with federal authorities at his ranch in Nevada. Bundy\u2019s clash with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) dates back to the \u201990s, when he stopped paying required fees for his cattle to graze on federal lands. In 1998, a court ordered him to remove his cattle from federal lands, but he has continued to let his cattle graze.",
        "A small group of men armed with rifles and pistols continues to occupy a federal wildlife refuge in remote southeast Oregon. In the nearby town of Burns, opinion over the situation is divided: Some people have welcomed the occupation and the attention it has brought to local frustration over the management of federal lands, while others reject the militants as outsiders.

        "It was never going to be easy to work out a truce in Syria. And the latest escalation of tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia is likely to spill over into the Syria talks, making prospects for a ceasefire even more remote, according to analysts who follow the region. Another potential loser in the feud is Iran\u2019s President Hassan Rouhani, who\u2019s been trying to open up his country to the world and is looking to gain additional allies in elections set for next month. But the latest events have played into the hands of his hardline opponents.",
        "The notion of a gun smart enough to tell who\u2019s holding it isn\u2019t new. Since the 1990s, inventors have been developing firearms geared with technologies that can authenticate their users \u2014 for instance by recognizing the fingerprint, the grip or an RFID chip \u2014 and stop working if held by the wrong hands. Several manufacturers have tried to introduce Americans to the concept, but the market here has been less than friendly over concerns that they are unreliable and would lead to more gun control. Supporters now hope that President Obama\u2019s new executive actions could turn things around.",
        "Saying that America faces a \u201dgun violence epidemic,\u201d President Obama is taking \u201da series of executive actions\u201d to reduce gun violence Tuesday, the White House says. First among the measures: tighter rules on background checks for gun buyers. President Obama made his case during a live address from the East Room of the White House Tuesday. We\u2019ve updated this post with news from the president\u2019s speech. \u201dWe are the only advanced country on Earth that sees this kind of mass violence erupt with this kind of frequency,\u201d Obama said. \u201dIt doesn\u2019t happen in other advanced countries.",
        "President Obama wept this afternoon as he remembered the children who were killed by a mass shooter in Newtown, Conn. Bill has the news on the executive actions Obama was detailing. But we wanted to call out the moment of the speech where the president became emotional. It came as he remembered the victims of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. \u201dEvery time I think about those kids, it gets me mad,\u201d the president said, wiping away tears.",
        "On the first day of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, it was the car companies that got the spotlight. The convergence of the auto industry and tech world began decades ago. There are millions of lines of code in the average car on the road. A recent study shows that tech (Bluetooth, lane assistance, backup cameras) are the deciding factors in new car purchases. The reality is that our cars are the biggest, most important and most expensive gadget we own. While consumers love gadgets, they love cars even more.",
        "Federal immigration agents have initiated a controversial roundup of Central American families who were part of the border surge that began in 2014. They are mainly young mothers with children whose asylum claims have been rejected. The Homeland Security Department says 121 have been picked up out of more than 100, 000 immigrants who crossed the border illegally. At a shelter home in East Austin, the raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, have terrified immigrants here who lost their cases and await deportation.",
        "The small eastern European nation of Slovakia has not exactly welcomed migrants. The prime minister, Robert Fico, opposes refugees under a European relocation plan and has even linked migration to terrorism. In one town, Gabcikovo, 97 percent of residents voted against accepting refugees. But a tiny migrant community has quietly lived and worked in Slovakia for decades, largely by staying under the radar. \u201dWe keep to ourselves,\u201d says Nguyen Kien Trung, 32, who was born in Vietnam and now lives in Bratislava. \u201dWe don\u2019t talk about our businesses."
