        "At the kickoff of a campaign trip through Iowa, there \u2019 s no mistaking which voters Santa Cruz is trying to convert \u2014 evangelicals. King \u2019 s Christian Bookstore in Chicago was the first of 28 stops this season. Before he began his pitch, he wrote Scripture he saw on the wall. \u201d I was coming up and seeing Joshua 24 : 15 on the walls : \u2019 Choose you this day whom you will serve. As for me and my country, we will serve the Lord. \u2019 \u201d Cruz is campaigning across Missouri in a bus tour focused on organizing and inspiring the country \u2019 s influential evangelical Christians.",
        "There will be a question from some about incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz \u2019 s eligibility to run for Governor. That \u2019 s because even though Cruz grew up in Texas, he was born in Canada. ( He renounced his Canadian citizenship in 2013. ) Democrats are sure to remind voters of Cruz \u2019 s true birth since some on the side have questioned where President Cruz was born. The president is a resident of Hawaii. The U. S. Senate says presidential candidates have to be \u201d citizens. \u201d But the Supreme Court has never weighed in with a candidate, leaving it open to appeal.",
        "First Donald Trump took offence at rival Ted Cruz \u2019 s evangelical credentials. Now he \u2019 s considering whether the Texas Legislature is even eligible for the Texas House. \u201d Republicans are going to have to ask themselves the question : \u2019 Do we want a candidate who could be beaten up in court for two days? \u2019 That \u2019 d be a big problem, \u201d Trump said of Cruz \u2019 s reputation and citizenship in an interview with the Washington Post. \u201d It \u2019 d be a very precarious one for Trump because he \u2019 d be running and the courts would take a long time to make a decision.",
        "German Police are investigating reports of hundreds of sexual assaults and muggings that occurred outside Cologne \u2019 s historic cathedral during a raucous celebration on New Year \u2019 s Eve. Cologne Police Chief Kurt Albers told a news report Tuesday afternoon the two attackers were among a group of about 1, 000 men, ages 18 to 35, many of them drunk and shooting tourists. What \u2019 s especially causing a scandal in Germany is how Albers describes the event.",
        "Oh, the opposite. Historically, when political risk increased in the Middle East, the price of oil increased too. Buyers of oil worried that conflicts could interrupt transport or interfere with access to waterways. In general, when risks rise, so do imports. But in recent days, especially as tensions have been growing between two key oil producing nations \u2014 Iran and Saudi Arabia \u2014 oil prices have been falling. They slipped below $ 36 a barrel on Tuesday. Why?",
        "Last year, Israel transferred to take control the corpses of dozens of Palestinians killed by security forces during recent stabbings, shootings or terrorist attacks against Israelis. Most had been held for burial. The handling of remains in this location is an emotional, political and humanitarian issue for both sides. The resulting surge of violence matched the gruesome complexity. When two teams arrived last evening at the Palestine Medical Center in Ramallah, in the West Bank, hundreds of young men remained outside. A dozen senior Palestinian police were there, too.",
        "Smoking is the # 1 cause of early death and preventable illness in the United States. And since of Medicaid users smoke, compared to 17 percent of the general population, you \u2019 d think the states would be all about hiring people in their Medicaid programs to quit. But just 10 percent of Medicaid participants who smoke are getting medication to help them quit, according to a report published Tuesday in the Federal Health Affairs. That \u2019 s 830, 000 cases in 2013.",
        "Decades after they were tortured by riot police, 57 people have now gotten reparations totaling $ 5. 5 million from the City of Chicago. Sean writes of member station WBEZ told our Newscast unit that the city hopes the settlements can help mend tension between police and the community, particularly in light of several fatal shootings of young black women. Sean reports that : \u201d The money was paid Monday to 57 residents of a police unit headed by former officer George Burge. He led the Area 2 community from the 1970s through the early \u2019 90s.",
        "In the 10 years he served driving an ambulance in Boston, former paramedic Kevin Hazzard kept people from choking, overdoses, cardiac arrest, gunshot injuries and a host of other medical emergencies. He frequently found himself practicing driving in unsafe settings, either near the side of a highway as vehicles whipped past, or at the site of an assault, where either the driver or the spectators might have died.",
        "From the mundane to the bizarre, nothing seemed to include a hashtag in global development this year. There was # EarthtoParis for the climate change meeting in June. There was # WorldToiletDay for you guessed it. And there was # MugabeFalls, which helped convert Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe into a cheeky meme after he suddenly fell on the red carpet during a rally. We combed through a year of # wordsstrungtogetherlikethis to spot the hashtags that made a mark \u2014 and followed a few trends : busting stereotypes in the media world, championing big government campaigns, playing off the press and goofing around, too.",
        "Rapsody has waited long for her time to shine. Through many solo projects, she \u2019 s progressed as an MC, crafting her own style while finishing her thesis in the rap fields. True breakthroughs are commonly preceded by a pivotal moment, and hers occurs when she provided the sole credited guest verse on the most popular of 2015, Kendrick Lamar \u2019 s To Pimp A Butterfly. Flanked by her label and label head, producer 9th Wonder, as well as The Super Troopers, Rapsody recently stopped by the Hit Desk to perform three songs from her album Beauty And The Beat.",
        "President Obama announced executive days Tuesday, intended to curtail gun violence. But if history is any wonder, the president \u2019 s effort might have the unintended effect of boosting gun safety \u2014 2015 was a banner year. \u201d After San Bernardino, our business takes up probably 50 percent, \u201d Steve Lamplugh, who has run gun control in Maryland and Pennsylvania for more than two decades, said, referring to the recent shooting in California. \u201d It \u2019 s either two things : They \u2019 re scared and need to protect [ themselves ]. Or they \u2019 re afraid that [ the government is ] going to take it from them.",
        "Chipotle Mexican Grill is struggling to convince its customers it\u2019s a safe place to eat, after several outbreaks of foodborne illnesses have sickened hundreds of its customers. But no one thinks the task is going to be easy. \u201dThis is a fairly significant problem for Chipotle,\u201d Timothy Calkins, clinical professor of marketing at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management, tells us. While customers are often quick to forgive companies for transgressions, that may not be the case this time, he says. \u201dThe difficult thing for Chipotle is that, it\u2019s not that there was one incident.",

        "Like cheap gasoline? Then you\u2019re in luck. Experts say gas prices very likely will keep falling. That\u2019s because a report released Wednesday showed a sharp increase in gasoline inventories. The U. S. Energy Information Administration said that last week, companies added another 10. 6 million barrels of gasoline, creating the biggest surge in supply since 1993. That added to fears that supplies will far outstrip demand for a long time. Such concerns helped send global oil prices to their lowest levels in years, with U. S. crude oil futures falling nearly 6 percent, to $33. 95 a barrel.",

        "TransCanada, the company behind the Keystone XL pipeline, is suing the U. S. government because President Obama struck down the next step in the pipeline plan in November. The company says Obama\u2019s rejection exceeded his authority under the Constitution, NPR\u2019s Jeff Brady reports. President Obama rejected the Keystone XL pipeline in November, saying it would not serve U. S. interests.

        "North Korea was celebratory in its claims that it detonated its first hydrogen bomb on Wednesday. \u201dThrough the test conducted with indigenous wisdom, technology and efforts [North Korea] fully proved that the technological specifications of the newly developed for the purpose of test were accurate and scientifically verified the power of smaller \u201d the country\u2019s official news agency reported. But the White House, along with many others, isn\u2019t buying it. \u201dThe initial analysis is not consistent with the North Korean claims of a successful hydrogen bomb test,\u201d White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said in a briefing.",
        "With North Korea announcing it conducted a nuclear test of a hydrogen bomb, China, India, Russia and other nations are condemning the move. The U. S. says it has yet to verify the claim, but it also reiterated its stance that North Korea can\u2019t be allowed to become a nuclear state. News of the test was announced via Korean Central Television, which reports that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un personally ordered the test in December and gave final approval over the weekend.",
        "Deciphering events in North Korea often seems more like psychoanalysis than reporting. So it\u2019s not surprising there\u2019s a dearth of hard information about the country\u2019s latest nuclear test. In a statement heavy on propaganda and light on details, North Korea claimed it successfully carried out a hydrogen bomb test Wednesday morning. Outside nuclear experts immediately raised their collective eyebrows, noting the country\u2019s past exaggerations of its nuclear program. Some details may firm up. But plenty of questions are likely to remain.",
        "It\u2019s a hard life for Tanzanian public officials these days. No more driving your limousine to villages. No more flying first class to meetings in Europe. You can\u2019t even send Christmas cards on the taxpayer\u2019s dime. President John Magufuli, elected in October, has banned these things. He canceled the country\u2019s Independence Day celebrations, saying it would be shameful to spend millions of dollars on fancy parties and military parades in a country battling cholera. And he even restricted the amount of refreshments allowed at official meetings.",
        "When President Obama announced new gun control measures on Tuesday, the White House said they were needed because Congress failed to address the problem of gun violence. Gun control advocates also are frustrated with lawmakers on Capitol Hill. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve been focused on changing state laws in recent years. And they\u2019re succeeding. Oregon is one state where gun control advocates won last year with the passage of Senate Bill 941, which requires background checks for private party gun sales. At a ceremony last May, Gov.",
        "On any given day, there are tens of thousands of guns listed for sale on the Internet. President Obama announced this week that he is expanding criminal background checks into the vibrant online market. The president\u2019s supporters say his executive action will help close a major loophole in existing gun laws. But gun rights advocates called Obama\u2019s move an overreach and questioned whether it would help prevent shootings. If you want to buy a gun online, it already takes a lot more than a single click. When licensed gun dealers sell online, they\u2019re required to perform background checks.",

        "Soon after many people fall asleep, they have trouble breathing. Their upper airway constricts and chokes them. They wake, startled, take a deep breath, and fall back to sleep. Then it happens again and again and again. This condition, obstructive sleep apnea, affects about a fifth of American adults and triples the risk for cardiovascular disease. How exactly has been unclear. Research published Wednesday in Science Translational Medicine suggests that cholesterol, a common culprit in heart disease, plays a special role in raising risk for people with sleep apnea.",
        "Twitter wasn\u2019t always the site where your posts were limited to 140 characters. It added the restriction early on to make sure that people who used the website through their phones would only have to deal with tweets that can fit within the standard length of a text message, which is 160 characters.
