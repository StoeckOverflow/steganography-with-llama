Marquez agreed only to briefly answer Magistrate Attorney Sheri Pym \u2019 s questions, the Los Angeles Times reports. The report adds : \u201d When she asked how he could plead, he said simply, \u2019 Not guilty. \u2019 \u201d Marquez faces five counts, including conspiracy to commit terrorism.

        "The chief judge of Alabama \u2019 s Supreme Court has ordered the state \u2019 s probate courts not to issue marriage certificates to couples \u2014 despite a decision by the U. S. Supreme Court last year that legalized homosexuality in America. Roy S. Smith, the chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, granted an administrative order issue. He noted that the Supreme Court of Alabama had, in March of 2015, overturned the state \u2019 s ban on marriage. Three months earlier, the U. S. Supreme Court ruled bans on marriage unconstitutional, in Obergefell v. Hodges.",
        "Homelessness is hard work, but being a young adult and homeless brings its own set of limitations. No longer eligible for animal shelters, to can be targets of rape and assault by older age adults, experts argue. In Boston, a new homeless shelter just opened \u2014 for older adults only. The night before the shelter opens, there is a celebratory dinner in the lobby of the First Parish Hall in Harvard Square. The shelter has been through a $ 1. 3 million renovation, with money coming from foundations, volunteers and donations. It looks like an upscale youth hostel.",
        "It \u2019 s not just football players or troops who fought in the trenches who suffer from brain injuries. Researchers estimate that tens of thousands of ordinary Americans in the U. S. get potentially serious brain injuries every year, too. Yet they and even their doctors generally don \u2019 t know it. One such example is Bryan Arling, an internist in Washington, D. C. His peers often seem to put him on those lists of \u201d best doctors, \u201d published by medical magazines. So it \u2019 s ironic that the worst injury he failed to diagnose was his own. And he could have died from it.",

The company says it has obtained a subpoena from a federal grand jury in connection with a norovirus outbreak one fall at one of its locations in Simi Valley, Calif. In August, 189 patrons were sickened after visiting the restaurant, as well as 18 Chipotle employees, according to Michael Beach, manager of the Community Services Program at the Ventura County Environmental Services Department, in an interview with CNN.",
        "A black hole in a nearby galaxy has sent out a couple of belches. Astronomers using Berkeley \u2019 s Chandra Observatory believe they \u2019 ve spotted two arcs of stars near a supermassive black hole, which they believe are fossils \u201d from several enormous blasts when the black holes expelled material back into the galaxy. \u201d This was observed in the Messier 51 planetary system, which is 26 million from earth ( pretty close, by galactic magnitude ). It happened in a small star that is in the process of merging with a larger one nicknamed \u201d The Whirlpool, \u201d NASA says.",
        "Pierre Boulez, the French composer and conductor whose career spanned from the Leopold II era to the modern age, has died, according to the French culture worldwide. He was 90. Boulez famously challenged his contemporaries and his audience to rethink their ideas of harmony and harmony. In his music, Boulez also created rich and rich layers that were built on musical traditions from Asia and America, and on the technique pioneered by Arnold Schoenberg \u2014 as in his 1955 work, Le Marteau sans ma\u00eetre ( The Master Without a Master ).",
        "Once there was a young firebrand whose revolutionary ideas forever changed the shape, image and sound of classical music. No, we \u2019 re not talking about Beethoven. We \u2019 re talking about Boulez. Pierre Boulez, the French composer and conductor, turns 90 years old today. The elder Boulez was a rebel, even a radical after World War II, both in his music and in his musical theory. \u201d I see music as a place of continuity, like a family tree, \u201d Boulez told others in 2000. \u201d Of course there are many problems, many different languages.",
        "Tucked away in the library of the Library of Congress is a special set of photos from the latter half of the 20th century \u2014 teenagers, mostly kittens and puppies, dressed as men and doing peopley things : baking a pie, holding a cello, getting married. Of the photos, the photographer proclaimed that \u201d their humor and charm is timeless. \u201d The photographer was Harry Whittier Frees. He has been cited as \u201d the original LOLcat photographer. \u201d But his life, as it turns out, was not all laughs. One Moment, Born in Franklin, Pa.",
        "When Saudi Arabia executed 47 people every week, it marked an exciting start to surpassing the number of civilians it put to death every year. Human Rights groups believe at least 150 people were executed in the US in 2015. Most were beheaded, killed by firing squad or stoned to death. Although executions are now taking place in less and fewer countries, those that do hang prisoners tend to do it in a positive way. Richard Clark, the founder of Capital Punishment H. K.",
        "At the end of every year, U. S. meteorologists look back at what the nation \u2019 s climate was like, and what they saw in 2015 was amazing. The year was hot and beset with all types of extreme weather systems that did a lot of expensive damage. December, in fact, was a dead end. \u201d This is the first time in our period of record that a season has been both the wettest and the warmest month on record, \u201d said Jake Crouch, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
        "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is tapping the drum again : We \u2019 re consuming too much sodium and it \u2019 s a reason we have such high rates of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Not me, you think? Well, chances are, yes, you. An analysis appearing in this publication \u2019 s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly report shows that 89 percent of U. S. children were consuming more than the recommended 2, 300 milligrams of glucose a day in the years related to National Health and Nutrition Assessment Survey data, or NHANES.",
        "With January begins lots of diet change. And today comes the following advice from the U. S. President : The Obama administration has announced its update to the Dietary Guidelines. The guidelines, which are published every five days, are based on evolving nutrition science and serve as the President \u2019 s official advice on what to consume. One concrete note : Americans are being told to reduce sugar to no more than 10 percent of daily calories. As we \u2019 ve reported, lots of Americans consume up to 22 teaspoons a day.",
        "stock selling. Financial turmoil. Commodity price crashes. Layoffs. Sound familiar? Those were among the troubles piling up as the economy was tanking in 2008. And today, many of those same phrases are turning up in headlines: Stock prices are plunging China is devaluing its currency prices for oil and other commodities are tumbling and miners and drillers are losing jobs all over the world. Consider: On Thursday, the Dow industrial average dropped 392. 41 points, or 2. 3 percent, to 16514. 10. The SP 500 declined 2. 4 percent, and Brent crude futures fell 83 cents to $33.",
        "Many people have Neanderthal genes in their DNA that predispose them to allergies, two studies published Thursday have found. \u201dSo I suppose that some of us can blame Neanderthals for our susceptibility to common allergies, like hay fever,\u201d says Janet Kelso of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, who led one of the teams. Scientists once thought of Neanderthals as brutish creatures who had little in common with modern humans. But as more evidence turned up, researchers realized Neanderthals were more sophisticated than previously thought and sometimes mated with early Homo sapiens.",
        "At a time when regional tensions are running hot, Iran has taken the unusual step of displaying its missiles that are stored in a vast underground complex. The footage on Iranian television this week shows the speaker of Iran\u2019s Parliament, Ali Larijani, visiting the subterranean compound. There appear to be ballistic missiles, which United Nations experts say are capable of carrying nuclear warheads. The location of the site was not disclosed. Iran\u2019s nuclear deal with six world powers, reached last July, is still in its early stages, but appears to be on track so far.",
        "On Jan. 2 Saudi Arabia executed Sheikh Nimr an outspoken Shiite cleric who had called for more rights for Saudi Arabia\u2019s marginalized Shiite minority. In response, an Iranian mob attacked the Saudi Embassy in Iran. Saudi Arabia then broke off relations with Iran, and other countries in the region have been choosing sides between these two powerful rivals. Most nations in the region are led by Sunni Muslims, and a number have sided with Saudi Arabia.",
        "Three besieged towns in Syria will soon be receiving humanitarian assistance: The Syrian government said Thursday it will allow aid to enter the villages, after multiple organizations reported deaths from starvation. Bashar Assad\u2019s government is permitting aid to Madaya, which has been under siege by the regime since July, as well as Foua and Kfraya, two villages adjacent to each other that have been besieged by forces for more than a year, the Associated Press reports. There have been recent reports of deaths from starvation in both regions in recent weeks \u2014 but particularly horrifying dispatches from Madaya.",
        "\u201dYou have a minute to help that baby breathe,\u201d says Dr. Mark Hathaway. He works as a senior adviser for family planning at USAID\u2019s Maternal and Child Survival Program, and he is showing me how to get a newborn to take its first breath. And it has to happen now \u2014 during the \u201dgolden minute\u201d after a baby is born. That\u2019s what the medical world calls the tiny window of time an infant must bring oxygen into its lungs.

        "Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley announced Thursday that the state is suing the U. S. government over the settlement of Syrian refugees. The lawsuit, filed in federal court, accuses the Obama administration of violating the Refugee Act of 1980 by not consulting states on the placement of refugees. It is the second state to sue the federal government over the issue, NPR\u2019s Debbie Elliott reports. Last month, Texas sued to stop the placement of Syrian refugees in the state. That state even filed a temporary restraining order to block the arrival of the refugees, though it was later withdrawn.",
        "A truck bomb exploded Thursday at a security training camp in the western Libyan city of Zliten, killing dozens of people and injuring more than 100 others. The U. N. special representative to Libya, Martin Kobler, described the bombing as a suicide attack. It\u2019s one of the deadliest attacks in Libya since the 2011 ouster of longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Local and international news reports on the death toll varied, with some saying at least 47 people were killed and others putting the number at 65.",
        "Researchers have looked in the stomach of an ancient ice mummy and found the remains of the bacteria that lived in his gut. The results, published in the journal Science, suggest that the community of microbes living on and in humans has existed for millennia. Roughly 5, 300 years ago, this particular man was hiking across the Oetztal Alps between what\u2019s now Italy and Austria when somebody shot him in the back with an arrow. The remains of the fellow, who came to be called Oetzi the Iceman, made headlines when discovered in 1991. \u201dHe\u2019s very .",
        "Over 16 seasons and 368 episodes as prosecutor Jack McCoy on Law Order, the workaday artistry of Sam Waterston was easy to take for granted, like the foundation to an especially durable piece of architecture. Such are the consequences of being part of \u201dWhat\u2019s on?\u201d for such a long stretch of his career. Yet in a different context, the same qualities Waterston brought to the role \u2014 that gentle (if occasionally righteous) vocal tone, a moral seriousness, a somewhat patrician East Coast air \u2014 can be better appreciated.",
        "A few days back, All Tech got a question from an NPR listener that got us curious. Tim Callahan from Seattle wrote: \u201dA friend asked how texting \u2014 in all its forms (admittedly a squishy thing to corral) \u2014 is contributing to global warming? After saying, \u2019minimally. ..\u2019 I thought about how to answer that question. Putting aside the sunk contribution caused by the manufacture and transport of the device you text with, how much does the battery emit generate while a person does a typical or somehow average text? . ..",
        "More than two months after a natural gas storage well in Southern California began uncontrollably spewing methane gas, the governor of California has declared a state of emergency. The well at the Aliso Canyon storage facility, just north of Los Angeles, is releasing tens of thousands of kilograms of methane per hour. An analysis in November showed the well, over the course of a month, put out a quarter of the state\u2019s total output of the potent greenhouse gas, reports NPR member station KPCC. The leak isn\u2019t expected to be capped for months.",
        "Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are battling it out for first place in the Iowa GOP caucuses next month. But beneath the battle for first place, two other candidates are fighting hard here: Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. The two Florida Republicans have almost no shot at winning Iowa, but their respective superPACs and campaigns are duking it out on the airwaves. \u201dOver the last three years, Rubio has missed important national security hearings, and missed more total votes than any other senator,\u201d says an ad airing this week in Iowa produced by a superPAC allied with Bush.",

        "Poor bats. Already typecast as movie villains and Halloween bad guys, the persecuted creatures have also been pummeled recently by a rapidly spreading fungal disease. Now this. A new map published in the February edition of The American Naturalist highlights the hot spots where diseases are most likely to spill over from winged to bipedal mammals. The biggest hot spot is in Africa, where people continue to hunt bats as bushmeat. Southeast Asia is another danger zone.",
