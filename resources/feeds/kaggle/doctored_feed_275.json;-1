        "West Indian manatees and some colonies of green sea turtles have been in danger of disappearing for decades. But scientists have some excellent news about the sea turtles, which both have their largest U. S. populations in Florida. The U. S Fish and Wildlife Service thinks the West Indian manatee should be reclassified from \u201d endangered \u201d to the improved status of \u201d turtles. \u201d The agency says challenges to manatees are being addressed \u2014 and they are responding with increasing population growth. Government officials say they counted only 1, 267 manatees in Florida when aerial photography began in 1991.",

The government wants the major Internet brands to root out ISIS recruitment online, and even help run global campaigns against ISIS. The meeting ended as the Obama administration ordered the creation of a task force of federal agencies to stop violent extremism. Media were not favorable to the Silicon Valley conference.

        "Tucked inside the U. S. government \u2019 s latest statement to its official eating rules is this recommendation : \u201d Drink water instead of sugary drinks \u201d \u2014 aka sugar. The bluntness of this statement is remarkable, in part, because the Dietary Guidelines released Thursday are, in other ways, anything but direct. For instance, as we \u2019 ve reported, instead of directly telling Americans to increase their intake of red and orange meats, as an advisory panel of diet experts had recommended, the current guidelines hint at meat reduction in subtle terms. That change in messaging may have been attributed to pressure from the meat market.",
        "After a week of gloomy discussions about China, the U. S. government came shining through on Tuesday, offering a surprisingly favorable jobs outlook for 2016. The U. S. economy is on track for \u201d high productivity, good productivity gains \u2014 and the supply of qualified workers expanding fast enough \u201d to allow employment to grow in 2016, IHS Global Insight reported in its analysis.",

The number of new jobs was higher than many economists had anticipated Labor \u2019 s John Ydstie says experts had expected about 200, 000 new jobs. In November, the BLS initially claimed the economy added 211, 000 jobs \u2014 a \u201d healthy pace, \u201d as Forbes \u2019 s Marilyn Geewax put it.

        "After news emerged that a commonly used cruise missile wound up in Germany following a training program in Europe, a U. S. diplomat said the Hellfire missile is inert, including key components. The missiles arrived in Cuba in 2014 Since then, U. S. requests for its use have gone unheeded. It \u2019 s still a question as to how the missile reached market, reports The Wall Street Journal, saying the crisis has \u201d confounded investigators and experts who work in a regulatory system trying to prevent precisely such devices from falling into the wrong hands. \u201d A U.

        "A reprint of Adolf Hitler \u2019 s notorious autobiography, Mein Kampf, or \u201d My Struggle, \u201d is for purchase in German bookstores today for the first time in 70 years. The annotated text is being published by the Institute for Social History, and its editors believe the new version leaves out Hitler \u2019 s lies and corruption and includes critical reflections on how the original version, written in the 1920s, influenced Nazi history. Given its muted unveiling in Germany, it \u2019 s hard to imagine the first edition becoming a hit as it was during the Nazi era, when there were 12 million copies in print.",
        "It \u2019 s been more than 70 years since the end of the Holocaust, but by a fluke of regional \u2014 and international copyright law \u2014 two stark reminders of the Holocaust may be entering the public domain in Europe on Thursday. Mein Kampf, Adolf Hitler \u2019 s manifesto, must its European copyright expire after c. 31 so too for Anne Frank \u2019 s Story of a Young Girl, due to several French publications.

        "Promising workers lower health insurance premiums for body weight did nothing to make them take off the pounds, a similar study found. At the start of a year, obese workers had spent less than 1. 5 pounds on average, statistically no different than the minute average gain of a tenth of a year for workers who weren \u2019 t offered a financial incentive to lose weight. \u201d Our study highlights some of the best \u201d of workplace wellness programs, wrote Dr. Mitesh Patel, assistant professor at the University of Michigan \u2019 s Perelman School of Medicine and the report \u2019 s lead author.",

        "A statue of Mao Zedong mysteriously cropped up in a remote field in China\u2019s central Henan province, as we reported this week. But it seems the homage to the founder of Communist China didn\u2019t have much time in the sun. The golden statue grabbed international headlines, sparking criticism and ridicule.

        "In an early scene in the deeply unsettling Lamb, protagonist Daniel Lamb phones a he\u2019s been having an affair with. \u201dMy wife is downstairs,\u201d he whispers. Not true \u2014 he\u2019s calling from a motel, where his wife has presumably banished him. \u201dI\u2019m lying here naked,\u201d he then purrs. Not true, either.

To watch Pressley on TV, you\u2019d never know this is her first time defending a celebrity this big against charges of this magnitude. In broadcast and cable TV interviews, she is unflappable.",
        "The armed militants occupying Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Eastern Oregon come from as far away as Texas and Montana. But they are hardly the refuge\u2019s first visitors. Malheur Lake is a regional hub for hundreds of thousands of migrating waterfowl. By some measures, it boasts the greatest diversity of bird species in the entire state.

His new book, Steve McCurry: India highlights the extraordinary moments of ordinary, everyday life across the subcontinent.

Stephen Coates, the leader of a British band called The Real Tuesday Weld, happened on this secret history by accident. Several years ago on a tour stop in St.",
        "As New Year\u2019s resolutions go, cutting back on food and drink are right at the top of the list. And while those vowing to change their eating habits may cut the carbohydrates or say a sweet goodbye to sugar, for regular drinkers, the tradition may involve what\u2019s known as a \u201ddry January\u201d: giving up booze for a month.

        "Joaquin \u201dEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n had seen his name in headlines. He knew it graced the world\u2019s Most Wanted lists.

Guzm\u00e1n was recaptured by the Mexican government on Friday, and has been returned to the same prison he broke out of in July.

        "When I met up with Palmer Luckey this week at CES, the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas, the founder of virtual reality company Oculus VR had some explaining to do. Oculus had just announced the price of its highly anticipated consumer model of the virtual reality headset Rift: $599. It sparked outrage from many fans who thought Luckey had promised them virtual reality for the masses, and at that price, the masses would have to skip car payments to afford it.",

They refer to themselves as a militia. They say they want states, not the federal government, to manage lands such as the Malheur refuge. They were among a larger group that showed up in Burns, Ore. to protest the convictions and jailing of an Oregon father and son who set fires that spread on to federal land."
