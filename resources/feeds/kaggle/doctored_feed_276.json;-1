        "Here \u2019 s one topic Americans can bank on writing about in next week \u2019 s State of the Union address : Gun control. The reaction to President Obama \u2019 s announced move this week was swift and reported as expected. advocates and House Democrats applauded his efforts groups and many Republicans openly denounced the orders as unconstitutional overreach. Expanded background checks are opposed to the president \u2019 s proposals. His legislation doesn \u2019 t rewrite existing laws, but it would broaden the scope of who is in the business. It would require more gun sellers abroad and at gun shows to be certified ( and perform checks ) among other things.",
        "# NPRreads is a weekly article on Twitter and on The. The premise is simple : Correspondents, editors and producers from our newsroom publish the pieces that have kept them hidden, using the # NPRreads hashtag. Each weekend, we discuss some of the best stories. Which ones are you in : Fearful of the coming robot apocalypse, or looking forward to the coming human nirvana? Being human, I \u2019 m mostly on the flip side of this question. So I received with interest a Quartz post the other night that made clear a robot apocalypse for some is a robot nirvana for others.",
        "Maine Gov. Joseph LePage is responsible for this week \u2019 s meme. During a lecture hall in Bridgton, Maine, last night, he spoke about Maine \u2019 s drug problem, positing a view on how some of the narcotics in the state make it in. He stated the following : \u201d The traffickers \u2014 these aren \u2019 t people who sell drugs. These are guys by the name Smoothie, Shifty. These type of guys that came from Connecticut and New England. They come up here, they sell their stuff, then they go back home. Incidentally, half the time they impregnate a small, white girl before they go.",
        "In 1982, when I washed up on Mom \u2019 s doorstep looking for a job, I grabbed a pickup basketball court. It endures to this day. That \u2019 s right, we are in our 33rd year, which makes me too old to actually be playing... and yet, ultimately, I still am. Every Sunday night over the decades, a bunch of guys \u2014 including an abundance of NPR staffers \u2014 has come along to run full hours in a rented gym. We \u2019 ve had architects, carpenters, doctors, locksmiths, IT guys, maintenance guys, lawyers, and at least one top White House staffer...",
        "The fight over genetically modified food, or GMOs, has largely resembled battles on the Eastern Front in World War I. and forces have aimed bursts of heavy artillery at each other, but neither side has given firm ground. This week, though, for perhaps the first time, a major combatant switched hands on one hotly contested topic : whether the government should use labels on genetically modified ingredients in food. The American Soup Co.",
        "Vermont resident Jamie Masefield has been improvising on the jazz stage for decades. He \u2019 s recorded ten albums, including six with Blue Note Orchestra, and brings everything from jazz and funk to the literature of Leo Tolstoy to the stage. But some years ago, his eclectic creativity brings him to an unexpected second phase. When I meet Masefield at work, he \u2019 s chipping away at some pinkish stone with a small hammer. \u201d In the industry we call it \u2019 white stone, \u2019 \u201d he offers. \u201d It \u2019 s very easy to work with. \u201d When he \u2019 s not making money, Masefield is a professional dry cleaning mason.",
        "\u201d Green Light did not last long in the Scorched. \u201d With familiar yet foreboding lines like this, Megan E. O \u2019 Keefe drew a vivid portrait of a bleak, bitter world in her second novel Steal the Sky. It takes place in the city of Aransa, a major town on the Scorched Continent, a land whose ancient abundance centuries ago gave way to arid desolation.

        "After seeing almost 662 bands in each 2013 and 2014, my concert schedule plummeted in 2015. This past year I saw only 506 bands take the spot, but I have an excuse. I wrote a lot. So more than 100 times this year I get to sit on my couch and talk instead of running out to one of my fave D. C. concert opening spots. I love the participatory aspect of concerts. There \u2019 s something about receiving approval at a show that makes it an active and communal sort of entertainment.",
        "Germany has begun 2016 with a deep and bitter debate : How should the country respond to the New Year \u2019 s Eve festivities in Cologne, in which mobs of men violently robbed and sexually abuse women on the streets? Concrete information about the night is sparse, and alternative narratives abound. \u201d A lot exists on New Year \u2019 s Eve in Cologne, much of it contradictory, little of it real, much of it surreal, \u201d wrote the staff of Der Spiegel, who obtained an internal draft document about the night \u2019 s festivities.",
        "On New Year \u2019 s Eve, a mob of gay men assaulted and harassed hundreds of women outside a busy train station in the German city of Cologne. Authorities and eyewitnesses differ on what motivated these attacks, but most people agree that many of those involved appeared to be North Caucasian or Arab. In the course of the inquiry so far, 31 suspects have been called in for questioning, more than half of whom were. That has sparked off a national debate in Cologne, which has taken the form of large demonstrations and protests on radio and traditional media.",
        "Time to put together the transcripts, the test materials and put the final score on those personal essays. It \u2019 s late application season, again. To a crowd of students, the process seems wrapped in a shroud of mystery. What really happens when you send your way out into the unknown only to... wait? Anyway, here \u2019 s a glimpse behind the veil at one school : Inside a tiny conference room at the College of the Holy Trinity in Worcester, Massachusetts, the steering committee is preparing to process 23 applications.",
        "On Tuesday afternoon, President Obama will deliver his final State of the Union address. It \u2019 s the last great speech many people will watch him deliver, and he deserves to leave a good impression. Here are five things to answer for. 1. How different will this speech be from his previous State of the Union address? White House aides are confident that this speech will be different. Instead of the usual laundry list of legislative proposals, the speech will be thematic and.",
        "The Mexican government shocked the world Friday, revealing that it had caught drug kingpin Joaquin \u201dEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n nearly six months after his second escape from prison.

        "In 10 months, Americans will go to the polls to pick the next U. S. president. When they cast their ballots, those votes will likely hinge on how they feel about the issues most important to them. But what are those issues? As a way of finding out, NPR\u2019s Rachel Martin centered her focus on one community going through a lot of change: Mecklenburg County, N. C. The whole county \u2014 including its biggest city, Charlotte \u2014 has been enjoying an economic boom.",
        "More than a week has passed since armed men took over the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. The militiamen are demanding that the federal government give up that land for people to use for ranching, mining and logging. But there\u2019s another group with roots on that land: Native Americans, especially the Burns Paiute tribe. The wildlife refuge is part of the tribe\u2019s ancestral lands. \u201dThe tribe is very offended,\u201d says Charlotte Rodrique, the chairperson of the Burns Paiute Tribal Council, in an interview with NPR\u2019s Michel Martin.",
        "When Eric Weiner sat down to write his new book he had to tackle a big question first: How do you define genius? \u201dThat\u2019s not as easy as it sounds,\u201d he tells NPR\u2019s Rachel Martin. \u201dI have a slightly unusual definition . .. that a genius is someone we all agree on is a genius.

        "Hundreds of people were lined up when the gun show opened at the fairgrounds in Miami. It was mostly men, but there were quite a few women and even some kids. Winter is a busy time for gun sales in Florida. But this gun show was busier than usual. Even before President Obama announced actions aimed at tightening controls on gun purchases, sales were up \u2014 partly in reaction to terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernadino. Gun dealers say the president\u2019s initiatives have also spurred sales.",
        "The Authors Guild has started the new year with a bang. First, the group, which represents the interests of writers, asked the Supreme Court to review an October appeals court ruling, which upheld Google\u2019s right to digitize books without an author\u2019s permission. A few days later, the guild addressed a separate issue when it released a letter to publishers demanding better contract terms for authors. Both moves come as many writers find it harder and harder to make a living from their writing.",

        "The West Bank city of Hebron is where Palestinians and Israeli settlers live within yards of each other \u2014 separated by Israeli barricades and soldiers. It\u2019s long been a place filled with friction, and over the past three months, nearly one out of three Palestinian attacks have taken place here, according to the Israeli military.

        "When President Obama first took the oath of office seven years ago this month, the U. S. economy was so battered that many economists were pondering the possibility of another Great Depression. The fears were real: Employers were cutting 796, 000 jobs the auto industry was facing bankruptcy private foreclosures and public debts were soaring. So the new president\u2019s rhetoric was somber. For millions of Americans, \u201dthe state of our economy is a concern that rises above all others, and rightly so,\u201d Obama said in his first address to a joint session of Congress.",
        "I am a Bowie girl. Not literally: I\u2019m a little too young to have swiped my face with glitter and run out in platforms to see David Bowie storming through America in 1972 and 1973 with the Spiders from Mars, when he sent queer and alien dispatches across a heartland primed for them by Stonewall and women\u2019s lib and the sexual revolution but also feeling the slap of the Silent Majority as the Nixon era lumbered on.",

        "David Bowie, who died Sunday at the age of 69, is for his music \u2014 but he was also an actor of considerable gifts. When he fell to Earth in 1976, an extraterrestrial seeking water for a dying planet, Bowie was persuasively otherworldly. One eye blue, the other green, hair a flaming auburn, his alien was the first glimpse movie audiences got of a rock star who had already been a \u201dSpace Oddity,\u201d sung about a Starman, and become internationally recognized as the Ziggy Stardust.",
        "It could\u2019ve gone so terribly wrong. According to Tony Visconti, David Bowie\u2019s longtime producer and mouthpiece for the final few years of his life, the English expat wanted to embrace manifold styles for his 25th album, \u2605 aka Blackstar, released last Friday.

        "The mammography debate heated up once again in April 2015, when the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force issued a draft of its latest breast cancer screening recommendations. Now, after the public had a chance to comment, the influential task force has finalized the advice, reiterating that women ages ought to receive a screening mammogram every two years. The USPSTF says that women between 40 and 49 don\u2019t get as much benefit from screening as do older women, so they should make an individual decision on when to start based on how they view the benefits and harms."
