        "If you \u2019 re confused about when to begin getting mammograms and how often you should be seeing them, you \u2019 re not alone. The very organizations that are responsible for telling us when and how far to get those screenings don \u2019 t agree. More than half of women 40 and older feel they should be getting a mammogram every year, according to a recent Health Analytics poll. That \u2019 s despite the fact that the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends getting screened only every other year \u2014 and only after women turn 50. On Tuesday, the National Cancer Society gave its own guidelines.",
        "The bananas you find in the big U. S. grocery stores are pretty much the same : They \u2019 re the white variety known as potato. In the market in Mayag\u00fcez, Puerto Rico, though, you have choices. Professor Irish, a scientist who has been employed at the U. S. Department of Agriculture \u2019 s Tropical Agriculture Experiment Station in Mayag\u00fcez, points out our problem. There are Cavendish bananas, to be sure, but two varieties, miniature ones and others that seem rather plump. Shop owners are around here, buying their bananas from farms on the border.",
        "Melioidosis is a disease that produces fear in those who \u2019 ve heard of it. Doctors in Southeast Asia and northern Australia know it as a deadly, potentially deadly disease that causes pneumonia, abscesses and, in the most extreme cases, organ damage. Without treatment, it can spread within 48 hours. Government officials worry it might be converted into an agent of radiation. But for decades, melioidosis seems to have lurked under the radar of global public health organizations. \u201d For everybody, it was a plague of southeastern Asia and Africa, \u201d says Dr. Jean Bertherat of the World Health Organization.",
        "Our cars are getting smarter and smarter : They may help you select or switch lanes, dictate lanes if you need them, link up with your GPS to play your calls and text or make sure you drive before it \u2019 s too late. As NPR \u2019 s Sonari Glinton has noted, an average car user has millions of lines of customers, and some recent research has demonstrated that the technological offerings are the contributing factors in new vehicle purchases. A new poll by Autotrader found that 70 percent of shoppers purchased vehicles with autonomous technologies like park reservations, collision avoidance and automatic braking.",
        "To deliver a Presidential address to a joint member of Congress is surely a rare privilege, but to do so at the start of one \u2019 s eighth and final year in that office is a rare thing indeed. The U. S. had 43 senators before Barack Obama, but only four of them stood before the Congress as Obama will this Tuesday night \u2014 as incumbents began their final year with a referendum on the State of the Union.",
        "Editor \u2019 s Note : With news that Donald Trump has selected Nikki Haley as U. S. ambassador to the United Nations, we are reprising this story, which was last posted in January. North Carolina Gov. Nikki White has a lot of qualities her son needs : She \u2019 s a rising Republican who is young, female and the product of Indian immigrants. That certainly could make her an easy vice presidential nominee for a Republican Party that seeks to diversify.",
        "What do the United Kingdom, Suriname, Papua New Guinea and Tonga have in common? These nations are among the few worldwide that don \u2019 t offer paid maternity leave at the highest level for new immigrants. Note that the United Kingdom is the only advanced economy to top the list most others spend at least 15 weeks. In a brand new talk presented at Ted. com, author Jessica Shortall makes the choice for paid family Leave \u2014 not only as a moral issue but as an educational one.",
        "Michigan citizens are stepping up their efforts to reduce elevated lead concentrations in Flint \u2019 s water after people accused them of responding too well to the crisis. Local residents are handing out water filters and jugs in the streets of Flint and have set up five new call centers for filters and recovery kits. And as Michigan Police reports, the coordinator of the regional response to the crisis says \u201d social workers will take visits to make sure homes have water pumps correctly installed, and people are getting the services they want. \u201d On Monday, Michigan Gov.",
        "Just because a toy \u2019 s doctor says it \u2019 s educational doesn \u2019 t make it so. That \u2019 s the finding from a new report in JAMA Pediatrics that found some toys being sold as language promoters got in the way of learning. Research indicates that for kids to understand, speak and eventually read or speak a language, they need to learn it \u2014 lots of it. And it \u2019 s never too late for parents and caregivers to get involved. That explains the booming industry in developing electronic toys that tries to help kids learn language.",
        "People who avoid certain popular treatments for heartburn, indigestion and acid reflux may expect to proceed more cautiously, researchers reported Monday. The medications, known as inhibitors ( PPIs ) appear to significantly elevate the chances of developing advanced kidney disease, according to a study involving more than 250, 000 patients. An estimated 15 million people use PPIs, which are sold by prescription and under a variety of brand names, including Nexium, Prilosec and Prevacid.",
        "The most prestigious prizes in American children \u2019 s literature were given out this morning : the first Newbery Medal for literature and the annual Caldecott Medal for illustration. Robert de la Tour becomes the first American author to win the Newbery, for his novel Last Stop on Broad Street, illustrated by Ray Robinson. It \u2019 s the story of a neighborhood boy riding the town bus with his grandmother, and wonder why their family doesn \u2019 t have a car. \u201d The intersection of diverse literature is so foreign to me, \u201d he tells NPR \u2019 s John Neary.",
        "When Sean Penn revealed in Rolling Stone that he\u2019d secretly met with Joaquin \u201dEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n \u2014 deep in the jungle in October, while the drug kingpin was still a fugitive \u2014 the news came as a shock to many. But it wasn\u2019t long before the actor\u2019s article drew criticism from observers \u2014 including Sen. Marco Rubio, who told ABC on Sunday, \u201dI find it grotesque.\u201d Perhaps the most vocal of Sean Penn\u2019s critics, though, were those people who are also most familiar with his article\u2019s subject: the Mexican and journalists who regularly report on Guzm\u00e1n.",
        "Right after Mexican authorities announced the third capture of Joaquin \u201dEl Chapo\u201d Guzman, we heard the real shocker: Just months before, Sean Penn had ventured into the Mexican jungle and secretly met with the kingpin. The Academy actor wrote an article for Rolling Stone about the encounter and he made it clear that it wouldn\u2019t have happened without the help of a Mexican actress. Kate del Castillo, he wrote, \u201dwas our ticket to El Chapo\u2019s trust.\u201d On screen, del Castillo was already playing the kinds of characters who may have had a relationship with El Chapo.",
        "The extradition of Mexican drug lord Joaquin \u201dEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n to the U. S. will likely take at least a year, according to the head of Mexico\u2019s extradition office, Miguel Merino. Speaking Monday on a Radio Formula program called Ciro G\u00f3mez Leyva por la Ma\u00f1ana, Merino said Mexico has begun processing two extradition requests from the U. S. but warned that Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers could pursue a number of possible legal appeals that could delay the drug kingpin\u2019s extradition for four to six years. NPR\u2019s Carrie Kahn reports that Interpol officers presented Guzm\u00e1n with two U. S.",
        "The obvious candidates for word of the year are the labels of the year\u2019s big stories \u2014 new words like \u201dmicroaggression\u201d or resurgent ones like \u201drefugees.\u201d But sometimes a big theme is captured in more subtle ways. So for my word of the year, I offer you the revival of \u201dgig\u201d as the name for a new economic order. It\u2019s the last chapter in the life of a little word that has tracked the rise and fall of the great American job. \u201dGig\u201d goes back more than a century as musicians\u2019 slang for a date or engagement.",

        "pain is very democratic in the people it strikes. \u201dIt\u2019s a universal experience. You\u2019d be a really uncommon person never to have had an episode of back pain,\u201d says Chris Maher, a physical therapist turned health researcher at the University of Sydney in Australia. \u201dIt\u2019s a common problem across the whole of the globe,\u201d he says, whether it\u2019s North America, Africa or rural India.

        "When Jack O\u2019Connor was 19, he was so desperate to beat his addictions to alcohol and opioids that he took a really rash step. He joined the Marines. \u201dThis will fix me,\u201d O\u2019Connor thought as he went to boot camp. \u201dIt better fix me or I\u2019m screwed.\u201d After 13 weeks of sobriety and exercise and discipline, O\u2019Connor completed basic training, but he started using again immediately. \u201dSame thing,\u201d he says. \u201dPercocet, like, off the street.

        "Keeping honeybees healthy has become a challenge for beekeepers. One main reason is a threat that has been wiping out bees since the late 1980s: the varroa mite. \u201dIt\u2019s a parasitic mite that feeds on the blood of adult bees and on the brood. It also transmits virus, and it suppresses the immune system of the bees,\u201d explains Penn State honeybee expert Maryann Frazier. It\u2019s basically like having a house cat attached to your side, sucking the life out of you. These mites wiped out colonies across the world. And treatments were, and still are, pretty limited.",

Residents can only drive their cars on either odd or even days, based on the last digit of their license plate numbers \u2014 though everyone gets a pass before 8 a. m. after 8 p. m. and on weekends.",
        "On any given episode of East Los High, the highly addictive teen soap on Hulu that just got a fourth season, you\u2019ll see love triangles and heartbreak, mean girls and bad boys, and some seriously skillful dancing. Think a Latino Degrassi meets Gossip Girl meets Glee. Clocking in at 20 minutes an episode with lots of online extras, the show is calibrated to get fans in their tweens, teens and 20s to inhale and then tweet things like \u201dFinished all 3 seasons of #EastLosHigh in a week and now I have no reason to live anymore,\u201d and, \u201dOMFG!",
        "Updated 5:20 a. m. ET Wednesday: Iranian state TV announced that all 10 U. S. sailors held since Tuesday in Iran have been freed. The Pentagon has confirmed the report, and says there are no indications that the sailors were harmed during their detention. Original Post: Ten sailors were detained by Iranian authorities on Tuesday as they sailed from Kuwait to Bahrain aboard two small riverine patrol boats. We still don\u2019t know the reason why the boats were stopped, but Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook says the U. S. has been in touch with the Iranians.",
        "Every year some 2 million Americans get infections from bacteria, and 23, 000 of them die from these superbugs. Superbugs are mostly a hospital problem: They\u2019re where these pathogens are often born and spread, and where the infected come for help. But hospitals are not where the majority of antibiotics sold in the U. S. are used. Food and Drug Administration data show that 62 percent of antibiotics important for human health are sold to food animal producers and used on farms.",
        "How close was notorious Mexican drug lord Joaquin \u201dEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n from pulling off another escape, right under the noses of Mexican authorities? According to a Tuesday interview with one of the marines involved in the raid that resulted in the kingpin\u2019s recapture four days ago, Guzm\u00e1n nearly slipped away again. In the interview with Mexican channel Televisa, the marine described how they swarmed Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s safe house in Los Mochis, Mexico, in an operation dubbed \u201dBlack Swan.\u201d He details how the world\u2019s drug kingpin almost wriggled out of reach yet again using a secret tunnel.",
        "There was a time when actor Ray Liotta would never have considered taking a role on television. \u201dWhen I first started, television was kind of like the wasteland,\u201d Liotta tells Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross. \u201dIt [was] like, \u2019Well, things are over now.

        "The California Air Resources Board has rejected Volkswagen\u2019s plan to recall cars with diesel engines that trick emissions tests, saying the company\u2019s plan is incomplete. The Environmental Protection Agency says it concurs. The move comes one week after the EPA filed a civil complaint against VW in federal court over the carmaker\u2019s use of a defeat device to mislead customers and fool inspectors into thinking the vehicles complied with U. S. rules \u2014 when in fact the vehicles were putting out up to 40 times more pollution than is allowed under federal standards.",
        "Here are a few safe bets for Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union: There will be dozens of applause breaks, endless moments and a laundry list of proposals (not to mention lots of reporters using the phrase \u201dlaundry list\u201d for the first \u2014 and maybe only \u2014 time this year). One more bet: Most of those proposals won\u2019t be successful. Since 1965, 39. 4 percent of all State of the Union policy requests have been successful in some way (that is, Congress has passed legislation fulfilling some part of those requests).",

She was supposed to play here at my desk the day after that evening\u2019s performance. Instead, she fell ill, wound up in a D. C. hospital, and canceled her upcoming dates. Now, Merchant has rerecorded her first solo album Tigerlily, complete with strings and different instrumentation. That album is called Paradise Is There: The New Tigerlily Recordings, and she recently came back to town to make a documentary film about that record."
