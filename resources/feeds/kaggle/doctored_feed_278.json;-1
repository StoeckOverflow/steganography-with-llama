That \u2019 s the situation in Taiz, Yemen \u2019 s third largest city, because of a blockade that resulted in a tactic in the civil unrest that began in September 2014 and greatly accelerated last December, when neighboring Saudi Arabia began a campaign of coordinated air strikes in many of the country \u2019 s recognized targets.

        "Veteran Dave Manning provided medical help during two combat deployments in Iraq. He \u2019 s also been the sole healthcare provider on a Navy deployment with more than 100 people. And yet, after 20 years of service, he says, \u201d Nothing I \u2019 ve done really crossed over [ into civilian jobs ] including basic EMT. \u201d But that is about to change.

        "David Foster \u2019 s death has a lot of national mourning. Though his first success was in music, he was cited as a trailblazer in fashion, film, social politics and, as it turns out, cinema. Here are just a few of his early forays into digital music. In 1996, he released his single \u201d Telling Truth \u201d online and got 300, 000 streams at a time when most of the world suddenly understood what the Internet was.",
        "Spain \u2019 s hilltop Imperial Palace towers over high class barrios across the Manzanares Bay, on the west side of town. The area is home to Juan and Margarita Rodriguez Prado, two girls in their late 60s, who huddled under a desk on Monday in their local fruit and churros shop, glued to photos of Princess Cristina \u2019 s flowers. Infanta Cristina de Borb\u00f3n, 50, is one of King Felipe III \u2019 s two older children. She went on trial Monday accused of tax fraud. \u201d I think she \u2019 s a good woman, but my God!

        "The U. S. Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that Florida \u2019 s process of permitting judges, not juries, to decide whether to impose the death penalty is unconstitutional. The vote \u2014 Justice Samuel Alito was the lone dissenter \u2014 reverses a 2014 judgment by the Florida Supreme Court. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote the court \u2019 s opinion, stating : \u201d The Sixth Amendment requires a jury, not a judge, to find each fact necessary to impose a sentence of death. A judge \u2019 s mere recommendation is not binding. \u201d Florida has nearly 400 prisoners on death row, the highest number of any state outside California.",
        "Nearly three weeks after members of a group occupied the remote Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in an armed protest over how the U. S. military treats cattle ranchers in southeast Oregon, it appears things are no closer to a resolution. So far, there has been only one brief conversation between Harney County Sheriff James Ward and the armed conflict \u2019 s de facto leader, Ammon Bundy. That meeting last summer led to little. And law enforcement still isn \u2019 t certain what, if any, action it might be wise to take against the militants, said Amanda Peacher of Oregon State Broadcasting.",
        "Here \u2019 s something that probably used to happen in Saudi Arabia : In the wake of the war with Iran, Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom \u2019 s deputy Crown prince and defense minister, as well as King Salman \u2019 s younger son, gave a statement to a reporter from The Economist, and the British Time magazine published the following transcript. This is a land where senior officers have rarely given notice. So it was striking that he had so much time to spend with a Western diplomat at such a tense moment. Saudi Arabia executed a young Shiite cleric on Jan. 2.",
        "From 2009 to 2014, more than 73, 000 guns that were captured in Mexico were traced to the U. S. according to a new focus on the effort to fight drug trafficking along the U. S. border. The figure, based on data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, represents about 70 percent of the 104, 850 firearms seized by Mexican soldiers that were also submitted to U. S. authorities for tracing. The report was analyzed by the Government Accountability Board, which notes in its report that U. S.",
        "In the middle of the month in Kenya, there \u2019 s a place with a city the size of Minneapolis, called Dadaab. It \u2019 s no ordinary city. This is the largest refugee camp in the country, home to nearly half a million people. Most come from Somalia, escaping the civil war that began in the late 1990s.

        "Joe Moore stood near a sign reading: \u201dAuthorized Personnel Only.\u201d \u201dI used to be authorized,\u201d he said. Moore is a coal miner. The sign was at the entrance to the mine that had laid him off the previous day. The Alliance Coal facility had closed \u2014 a symptom of the coal industry\u2019s rapid decline. The industry is fading even as the rest of the economy grows. The Energy Information Administration estimates that nationwide coal production dropped by as much as 10 percent in 2015.

Winnowing those 84 down to the 15 you see here wasn\u2019t easy, but we settled on an impressive array of highlights, from a band to a lone guitarist to a massive, virtually indescribable dance party.

        "Some offices have sandwich carts. We have live music. Almost every week here at NPR\u2019s offices in Washington, D. C. someone performs in the NPR Music department \u2014 specifically, at the desk of Bob Boilen, host of All Songs Considered. He\u2019s had big bands behind his desk that seem too big to possibly fit into an office cubicle. Big personalities like Adele and have performed there, too. It\u2019s a series we call Tiny Desk Concerts. Late last year, NPR Music launched a contest to give an undiscovered band a chance to play behind the Tiny Desk.",
        "Politics and science are two very different beasts. Science, at its best, tries to extract some measure of truth about the world from a combination of observation and theory. Politics, even at its best, may be more concerned with perception than truth, using the former as a means to advance policy goals. So, what happens when the two collide in addressing a possibly existential threat to global civilization? This is the question lying like a shadow over broader discussions about last month\u2019s Paris climate conference and the agreement it produced.",
        "On Nov. 30, 1999, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in downtown Seattle to protest the World Trade Organization conference being held at the city\u2019s convention center. It didn\u2019t take long for the situation to deteriorate after some protesters started smashing windows and occupying intersections, police officers began to use tear gas and pepper spray in an effort to disperse the crowd.

It turns out, secretively purchasing luxury real estate is a popular way for the world\u2019s to clean their dirty money. \u201dYou can spend a lot of money to buy a house, and then you can sell that house a year later,\u201d says Heather Lowe, a lawyer with Global Financial Integrity. \u201dAnd all of a sudden, all of that money is completely clean money.\u201d Her group tracks the transfer of illicit money out of developing countries.",
        "Talk about belated recognition. At its meeting in Washington, D. C. on Jan. 7, the American Dialect Society voted to make the pronoun \u201dthey\u201d their word of the year for 2015. Or more precisely, a particular use of that pronoun that grammarians call the singular \u201dthey.\u201d This is the \u201dthey\u201d that doesn\u2019t care whether it\u2019s referring to a male or female.",
        "The singer David Bowie, one of the most creative performers in rock \u2019n\u2019 roll history, died of cancer at age 69 on Sunday \u2014 two days after releasing a new album. I remember going to a few of his concerts when I was a graduate student in London in the \u201980s. One performance, at the satellite city of Milton Keynes, was particularly striking. There he was, incredibly elegant in a white linen suit, his androgynous face an enigma. He didn\u2019t look quite human, then and always. If you don\u2019t believe me, watch the video of Ashes to Ashes.",
        "Hillary Clinton wants you to know she has a new tax proposal. She also wants you to know that Bernie Sanders does not. Late Tuesday, Clinton released a plan aimed squarely at a specific subset of Americans: that is, the very rich. She also went on the attack against Sanders, who has yet to release his tax plan (and who has also spent his political career taking aim at the richest Americans). The Sanders camp says its plan is coming before the Iowa caucuses on Feb.",
        "In the kitchen of a small eatery in Reyhanli, Turkey, Abu Mohammed took a break from deboning the flank of a freshly slaughtered lamb to opine on grave matters happening just across the border in Syria. \u201dThis is what should be done to the Islamic State,\u201d he says, jabbing and swiping the air with his knife as if he were eviscerating one of the extremist fighters. Having illustrated his disdain for ISIS, Mohammed laid down the knife on his butcher\u2019s block and resumed tearing each rib away from the meat.",
        "Customers crowd into a bustling Budapest restaurant for dinner. They open their menus, expecting to read about stuffed paprikas and Hungarian goulash. But instead they find . .. Eritrean sourdough pancake bread. Afghan pie. Syrian sweets. \u201dIt\u2019s a little bit difficult, because not all the ingredients are available in Hungary. So a few of them are coming from Austria or other countries.

        "Hall of Fame center fielder Willie Mays was once quoted as saying, \u201dI think I was the best baseball player I ever saw.\u201d But when it came to life off the field, the legendary player credits his former teammate and fellow Hall of Famer Monte Irvin with being his teacher. Irvin died Monday at his home in Houston at the age of 96.

        "So . .. have you bought a Powerball ticket? The jackpot is now at $1. 5 billion \u2014 the largest jackpot in world history. (Full disclosure: NPR is playing the odds. Our CEO bought every regular employee a ticket.) And yes, $1. 5 billion is a lot of money. It\u2019s a lot even if you take the smaller cash payout \u2014 $930 million \u2014 instead of the lifetime annual payments. It\u2019s a lot even after you account for taxes: If you live in a state that doesn\u2019t tax lottery winnings, once you pay Uncle Sam, you\u2019ve got $561.",
        "The Powerball bonanza, which has touched an unprecedented $1. 5 billion, may be the largest jackpot in human history, but the frenzied ticket buying and wild hopes attending it are hardly new.
