        "The litigants in the U. S. Supreme Court Wednesday were a large bunch : On one hand, the Central Bank of Iran. On the other, the victims of terrorist acts going back many decades. The constitutional questions : Whether Congress \u2014 in accord with both \u2014 had infringed on the independence of the judiciary.

        "\u201d Messieurs, c \u2019 est les microbes qui auront le dernier mot. \u201d \u201d say, it is the microbes who will have the last word. \u201d That report from 19th century disease specialist Louis Pasteur is not what you \u2019 d expect to see at the start of a report from some of the world \u2019 s top public health officials. But the report itself has a strong message : We \u2019 re not prepared for the next coming plague or pandemic \u2014 or vaccine 2. 0.

        "When Ryan Brown \u2019 s son Joel was 1 year old he was diagnosed with an advanced brain cancer. Over the following few years, he underwent months of chemotherapy and radiation, only to have the cancer overcome. Feeling helpless, Ryan turned to what he knew as a computer game developer. He started working on a game as a way to understand and confront his father \u2019 s deteriorating health.

        "The U. S. Department of Agriculture \u2019 s first attempts at offering nutrition advice came in 1894, when W. O. Atwater, a founder and pioneering nutrition expert for the agency, published this recommendation in a Farmer \u2019 s Bulletin : \u201d though care is exercised in providing food, a diet shall result which is or badly deserved.... The evils of overeating may not be felt at once, but sooner or later they are sure to pass... \u201d Thus began the USDA \u2019 s long struggle to craft scientific advice based on the available scientific evidence.",
        "The first time I told a guy I \u2019 d found online that I didn \u2019 t want to see him again, my hands were actually trembling. I paced the room. I spoke sentences only to erase them and retype them again. You \u2019 d think I was telling the guy I was sorry, not passing on his offer to make homemade linguine. Somehow, I \u2019 d made it to my mid 30s without the ability to tell another human soul I wasn \u2019 t interested in dating him. I wondered how to lie : I \u2019 m very busy right now. I \u2019 m sick with the flu.",

Nikki Haley said she had Donald Trump in favor when she criticized the \u201d angriest voices \u201d within the GOP in her State of the Union speech. \u201d Mr. Trump has never contributed to what I think is just irresponsible politics, \u201d as have others in the media, in her district and across the country, Haley said on NBC \u2019 s game show Wednesday morning.

His prestige projects include the headquarters of a pharmaceutical corporation in China and a dormitory at St. Edward \u2019 s University in Austin, Texas. But Aravena is known for creating conscious, sustainable architecture, often executed at staggering costs and on minuscule budgets. He pays careful tribute to residents of the places where he lives.

        "A stellar explosion is baffling astronomers, who say this cosmic beast is so immensely powerful that no one\u2019s sure exactly what made it go boom. The recently discovered inferno is about 200 times more powerful than a typical exploding star, or supernova, and 570 billion times brighter than our sun. It was first spotted in June by the Automated Survey for Supernovae, nicknamed the \u201dAssassin\u201d project, so it\u2019s called .

        "The secretive sale late last year of the Las Vegas Nevada\u2019s largest news organization, to the family of one of the wealthiest men in the country set off shock waves in that newsroom. The vast financial and political interests of the billionaire casino magnate and major Republican donor Sheldon Adelson raise nettlesome questions about how the paper can cover him. Yet some journalists say there is a more pointed problem: his sensitivity to what reporters actually do. His lawyers have filed three libel suits against journalists on his behalf, one of which is still ongoing.",

        "Eating healthfully in America is hard. We have to contend with constant sugary and oily temptations, while pervasive ads coax us to eat these items day in and out. The public health community generally agrees that regulations and taxes could help remind us of the potential health toll of the unhealthiest items \u2014 like beverages high in sugar \u2014 and keep us from consuming too much of them. Lately, the idea of affixing a health warning label to sugary beverages also has been getting traction. So far, no city or state has been able to pass such a measure.",

The reason: growing concern among researchers that the virus could be causing babies in Brazil to be born with brain damage. The Zika virus is named after the Zika forest in Uganda, where it was first identified in the 1940s. For decades it was a rare disease, primarily popping up in Africa and occasionally in Southeast Asia. In 2007, there was a major Zika outbreak in Micronesia. Then in May of 2015 the virus turned up in Brazil.",

That was the beginning of a large ongoing outbreak that quickly spread north and has now reached more than 20 countries. And a virus once thought to be not too serious has taken an alarming turn.",
        "The Episcopal Church has been disciplined by the Anglican Communion, the international faith fellowship of which the church is a part, over deep disagreements about homosexuality and marriage. The church has not been removed from the communion. However, it will be barred from Anglican for three years and will no longer represent the community in ecumenical or interfaith bodies, the Anglican organization has decided. The Episcopal Church consecrated its first openly gay bishop in 2003. In 2012, the church voted to allow blessings over unions, while not calling them identical to marriage.",
        "Instead of the Summer Games, you might as well call these the gloomy games. Back when Rio de Janeiro was awarded the 2016 Summer Olympics, seven years ago, the country was on a high. The economy was growing, the middle class was expanding and the country seemed finally to be realizing its potential.

        "One of the problems with river blindness is that it doesn\u2019t kill you. It\u2019s a nasty disease that causes agonizing itching, disfigured skin and, in the worst cases, blindness. River blindness is a parasitic infection transmitted by black flies that breed in rapidly flowing bodies of water. The worms burrow under your skin and eventually wiggle across your pupils, destroying your vision. But because the disease usually isn\u2019t fatal, health officials in tropical countries have slotted it lower on their lists than malaria, TB, cholera, AIDS and other diseases.",
        "In Fort Morgan, Colo. 150 Muslim workers were fired in late 2015 after a dispute over prayer breaks at a Cargill beef processing plant.

        "The Ebola outbreak in West Africa may be officially over \u2014 the World Health Organization made that momentous announcement Thursday, but more cases are likely to crop up and crucial questions about the disease remain unanswered. We asked Dr. Daniel Bausch, an expert on Ebola who is now working with the World Health Organization, to list the top five mysteries researchers still need to clear up. How did the virus reach West Africa? For decades, Ebola disease was confined to remote regions of Central Africa \u2014 thousands of miles from Africa\u2019s populous Western coast.",
        "The World Health Organization announced Thursday that the Ebola epidemic in West Africa is over \u2014 for now.

That\u2019s equal to two full incubation cycles of the virus. The most recent outbreak was in Liberia, which had previously been declared in May and in September last year. Each time, at least one new case was later discovered."
