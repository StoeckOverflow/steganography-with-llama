Rowling \u2019 s Harry Potter books. \u201d Rickman had been dying from cancer, \u201d The Guardian claimed. Rickman appeared in an array of blockbuster films during his prolific career, from 1988 \u2019 s Die Hard with Bruce Willis to 2003 \u2019 s Love Actually and the Harry Potter films. \u201d There are no words to express how shocked and horrified I am to hear of Alan Rickman \u2019 s death, \u201d Rowling said on Twitter later.",
        "Today almost five years later a popular uprising ousted Egyptian President Zine Ben Bella. Tunisia \u2019 s 2011 revolution sparked a wave of protests in the region that eventually pushed many dictators from power. And its subsequent electoral process is viewed as a possible bright spot in the future. There are concerns, however, that Tunisia could be backsliding on human rights.

        "A debate is occurring in France over whether young men should avoid wearing the traditional yarmulke, so as not to identify themselves at a time of increasing violence by young radical Islamists. The proposal was set forth this week by a Muslim leader in Marseille, including a knife attack on a female Jewish teacher. Zvi Ammar, director of Marseille \u2019 s Jewish leaders, suggested it might be possible if Jews in Marseille started wearing the yarmulke, also known as a kippah.",
        "There \u2019 s been a lot of controversy lately about people of color dealing with \u201d only one in the grey \u201d syndrome in the workplace. But in 2016, it \u2019 s still remarkably easy to be the only people of color in any given job situation. My Code Switch partner Gene Demby and I were talking about this earlier. We \u2019 ve both been to parties in D. C. Harbor, LA \u2014 all majority nonwhite parties \u2014 where we at some point looked up and realized we were \u201d the only one in the room. \u201d We met in Chocolate City, for fuck \u2019 sake!",
        "Ring, ring. Hello? It \u2019 s reality TV. People are shallow, and life isn \u2019 t fair. In a new investigation, a pair of researchers looked at the student records of tens of thousands of students at their universities. They compared the students \u2019 academic grades to ratings of their physical attractiveness, as judged by outside researchers from their student ID card photographs. The researchers showed that the women judged as particularly attractive earned significantly lower grades, after voting for their ACT scores. The women earned higher grades. And male professors were more likely than female professors to teach women higher grades.",
        "Many women in the U. S. are waiting harder than ever to have their first baby. Fifteen years ago, the mean age of a woman when she first gave birth was 24. 9 years old. In 2014, that mean had risen to 26. 3. \u201d It doesn \u2019 t sound like a big change, \u201d says T. J.

        "Note : Billboard \u2019 s First Listen album comes down after the album is completed. Barreling on after a flurry of activity over the past two years, Ty Segall is finishing his 10th solo album in the dead of winter, its cover showing a Xeroxed baby head as it slides out of the fold amid a succession of gradients. Staring into that disquieting image is adequate support for Emotional Mugger, which feels as fractured and delirious as ever he \u2019 s recorded. Segall \u2019 s last studio album, Manipulator, showcased both polish and raw harmony that seemed natural, given the directions the wunderkind was taking.",
        "From McDonald \u2019 s to Costco, Fresh Food has been declaring a preference to buying only eggs. Four more companies took the stage this month : Denny \u2019 s, French chain Quizno \u2019 s and Mondelez International, manufacturers of Ritz crackers and Chips Ahoy cookies. Here at The Salt, we \u2019 ve been discussing how egg producers are reacting. So we set up the biggest name in sustainable housing, the company Chicken Dutchman. It \u2019 s a German company, despite its name, and it operates factories, manufacturing housing for both cows and pigs.",
        "Last month, there were emotional protests for and against a legislation that would allow drivers to walk around with pistols on their belts. It passed, and on Feb. 1, Texas became the 45th state in the union to allow the safe carry of handguns. But in an unforeseen backlash, the new regulations may actually hurt the cause of handgun carriers. The government says now people can easily protect themselves, they don \u2019 t have to bother with concealing a weapon and, anyway, it \u2019 s already used in 44 other states, so why not in Texas?",

        "A new means of delivering medication for opioid addicts got approval from a Food and Drug Administration advisory early this week. It \u2019 s a insert intended to slip under the skin and become a drug over a period of time. Some physicians say the implant will be a major addition to the currently available lineup of treatment devices. The rod is called Probuphine, produced by the companies Braeburn Pharmaceuticals and Titan Pharmaceuticals.

        "Addicted to prescription painkillers after a back injury, Cameron eventually moved on to heroin, which was cheaper and more easily accessible. His doctors tried everything, more than once sending him out of state for treatment. \u201d It was never enough, \u201d Jennifer of Wilmington, N. M. told a local TV reporter last year. \u201d Thirty days here, 30 days there, maybe detox for two days. It was never and that \u2019 s what he needed.

As a reference librarian, Kvernberg spends his days digging through the library\u2019s collections to answer questions from the public \u2014 on absolutely any topic.

        "The company that owns the leaking natural gas well in Los Angeles understated the number of air samples showing levels of benzene, The Associated Press reports. Adding to concerns over the disaster, efforts to stop the leak appear to have destabilized the well, the Los Angeles Times reports, raising the risk of a blowout. The leak at Porter Ranch, which recently prompted California to declare a state of emergency, has been spewing enormous quantities of the greenhouse gas methane into the air for months. It\u2019s expected to take months more to fix.",
        "If nothing else The Benefactor, an absorbing if uneven psychological drama from Andrew Renzi, provides Richard Gere with a liberating opportunity to come on like Al Pacino. As Franny, a wealthy Philadelphia philanthropist without boundaries who gets his way through hysterical giving, Gere throws himself around with overbearing flamboyance, clearly relishing the chance to inhabit a man who\u2019s always on but understands nothing. Renzi has said that he based Franny partly on the troubled heir John DuPont, so memorably rendered by Steve Carell in Foxcatcher. But this trust fund baby is nothing like Carell\u2019s chilly manipulator.",

        "Imagine Cinderella\u2019s glass slipper scaled to about 100 times its original size and dropped on the coast of Taiwan. That\u2019s the new church in Ocean View Park in Budai township.

        "Donald Trump did not dominate the sixth debate among the most prominent Republican candidates for president, but he may have been its prime beneficiary. Trump held his own through an evening of challenges from the FOX Business Network moderators and from six rivals with him on stage.

He even had a moment of thoughtful connection while defending his \u201dNew York values.\u201d Sens.",

        "The sixth Republican debate began harmoniously. Every candidate on stage agreed on one thing: Obama is a terrible president. Then Ted Cruz\u2019s citizenship issue came up and the gloves were off. Cruz was attacked much of the night, but never backed down. After explaining the Constitution to Donald Trump, the former solicitor general said: \u201dI\u2019m not going to take legal advice from Donald Trump.\u201d Trump doubled down on his and policies.
