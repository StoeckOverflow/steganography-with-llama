Officially, Sea Plane And Oxbow is Shearwater \u2019 s ninth studio album, so it \u2019 s fair to expect a of sorts at some point, to assume that months of recording and touring might begin to drain the vitality from Jeff Meiburg \u2019 s grandiose and ambitious compositions.",

It \u2019 s marked as Implementation Day, the day when the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, says that Iran has curbed its nuclear program enough to consider receiving relief on Friday.

        "On Saturday, Germany released four people and the U. S. released or pardoned nine Iranians, and dropped extradition requests for 14 more, in a well choreographed prisoner uprising. Iran also successfully released a fifth former detainee. The news comes as Iran is poised to celebrate \u201d Implementation Day, \u201d marking the fulfillment of its obligations under the Tehran nuclear pact, and the end of sanctions against the country. The final list includes some surprise \u2014 and a few surprises. Jason Rezaian, Daily Post journalist Jason Rezaian is a native of California.

        "Water shortages in Flint, Mich, \u2014 where the city supplies water sources, resulting pipe corrosion and ultimately filling the city \u2019 s water infrastructure with high levels of sewage \u2014 has prompted President Obama to declare a state of emergency. The move, which was requested by incumbent Gov. Rick Snyder, said FEMA is authorized to provide programs and resources to the people statewide. Federal funding will help cover the cost of drinking water, water supply and other items. A state of emergency has been declared by Flint \u2019 s own citizens since. Pediatrician Dr.",
        "This year, time to have your awareness raised. And raised. And raised. And then raised some more. At first, that \u2019 s the goal of the United States \u2019 packed calendar of \u201d observances \u201d \u2014 days, weeks, years and periods \u2014 dedicated to subjects truly worthy of the world \u2019 s best. But what was once just a few dates has now ballooned into a list that \u2019 s pretty much impossible to digest. Which is kind of funny, given that we \u2019 ve just pulled off the U.

        "If you thought your 2016 was getting busy, just be glad you \u2019 re not the United Nations. The organization will be running 129 \u201d International Days \u201d \u2014 not to mention assorted weeks, decades and a half. Looking over the list is weird but also enlightening. It \u2019 s clear certain dates are more popular than years. The most extreme case is December 21, when five days hold a spot on the calendar. That \u2019 s pretty odd when you realize that there are huge gaps without any exceptions. January has only one : the World Day of Commemoration in Memory of the Victims of the Holocaust.",
        "Five months ago, Ted Williams became famous. The Pittsburgh Dispatch posted a video of Williams, panhandling on the side of the road, screaming off a announcer \u2019 s voice. The video went viral, and Williams \u2019 s striking baritone was echoed around the world. Here on the the news led one of our dog tags... \u201d Ted Williams, man with the golden teeth. \u201d Williams had once made a song out of his voice, but then alcohol and alcohol brought him down, he explained.

        "The FBI will now investigate animal abuse the moment it tracks arson or assault. This could help save more lives \u2014 and, perhaps, people : evidence has shown that animal violence is often a precursor to other forms of violence. And tracking evidence of violence against animals may help law enforcement intervene before that develops into crimes against people. John Thompson, deputy executive secretary of the National Sheriffs \u2019 Association, has been successful in moving this idea forward.",
        "Depending on whom you visit, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley \u2019 s State of the House response this week was either going to save the local Republican Party or political conservatism. This week, those differing sentiments evoked two different hashtags. Both, in some ways, were about Haley \u2019 s heritage, and they took to light the tricky way she \u2019 ll have to exit race should she take on a more active role in the 2016 election. # DeportNikkiHaley, After Haley gave the Republican endorsement to President Obama \u2019 s third and final State of the Union address this week, some conservatives were not disappointed.",

Visiting the church quarterly was \u201d the right thing to do, \u201d she told me, given the circumstances that she had both diabetes and high blood pressure. She always set the agenda at our visits. She compiled lists of questions and notes that followed the recommendations of her favorite churchgoers and the health materials she had submitted. It came as no surprise to me when she decided to undergo a colonoscopy at age 68, in order to be screened for colon cancer.",
        "New Democrat Republicans have a track record of picking presidential nominees who often go on to gain their party \u2019 s nomination. Generally, that means bolstering establishment Republicans. But this year, billionaire Donald Trump is polling way ahead of the rest of the state. That leaves his rivals competing amongst themselves in the hope that none of them can take down Trump in the seat that holds the first election. There \u2019 s not much time left for establishment Republicans to decide on a favorite.",

        "A quartet of siblings and assorted spouses, lovers and friends all spend a holiday in the English family summer house they\u2019ll have to sell. Do you think everything will go just swell for those three weeks? Or will tensions simmer, and secrets break out of storage as quarrels, tears and fatal attractions roil the old house in the summer heat? Tessa Hadley\u2019s novel The Past has already been praised in Britain, and now it\u2019s out in the U. S.

        "When the Nobel for Medicine goes to two scientists who discovered a drug used to fight a variety of neglected diseases, how do you tell the story? NPR\u2019s Jason Beaubien decided the best way was to go to one country where the drug \u2014 ivermectin \u2014 has made a major difference in people\u2019s lives. That\u2019s what took him to Ghana, where yearly doses of ivermectin have dramatically reduced the scourge of river blindness, a disease caused by parasitic worms that can rob people of their sight.

That means schools must often settle for people who are and inexperienced. Special ed is tough, and those who aren\u2019t ready for the challenge may not make it past the first year or two.

        "There\u2019s a familiar kind of book. A white man \u2014 specifically a Briton \u2014 in Asia. You can already sense him aloof, condescending, assured. The world is his playground and he\u2019s out to play. That kind of book has already been written. Lawrence Osborne\u2019s Hunters in the Dark is not that book. Its white man, Robert Grieve, is some of the things above. But mostly he\u2019s \u201dignorant and innocent,\u201d unaware of the world and its many cruelties.",

        "The Glory of the World is a new play that celebrates author and Catholic monk Thomas Merton \u2014 but it isn\u2019t really about Merton. \u201dEverybody is far more complicated than that one simple line about being a great mystic, a great Buddhist, a great activist, whatever,\u201d says playwright Charles Mee.

Arrests took place the first weekend of January DHS has confirmed that 121 people were detained in those operations.
