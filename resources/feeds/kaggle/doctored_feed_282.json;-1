        "The Sesame Street of your dreams has changed. Elmo has moved into a different apartment, Big Dad has a new nest and Jerry the Grouch is hanging out in recycling and compost bins, like his usual trash can. But the greatest change may be how you remember Sesame Street. The 46th season of the original children \u2019 s show premieres nationwide on HBO, the network that \u2019 s devoted to provocative shows like Game of Thrones and Girls.

He went to private schools and lived in a nice house, but it wasn \u2019 t big in Mr. Rogers \u2019 case. \u201d I grew up waiting for a carpool with hookers who knew me by name, drug lords knew me by name, \u201d Amos says. \u201d Across the road was an apartment complex that was home to a lot of kinda guys. \u201d Since then, he has worn a lot of hats in the music business : singer, songwriter, actor.",
        "If you think it \u2019 s fair that we pay homage to David Bowie on Alt. Rock this week, think again. Bowie has had a tremendous fan following throughout Latin America, and he \u2019 s been a strong musical influence. His talent was so great, and his songs so diverse, it left few musical genres untouched. Everything means different songs to different people. For Luis Contreras, growing up in the \u2019 70s in California, Bowie was always playing in the clubs. But he says really got a fan when the singer started experimenting with RB and AC.",

In the wake of the terrorist bombing, we are republishing it now. Belgian author Isma\u00ebl Sa\u00efdi says he didn \u2019 t choose the title of his latest work, Djihad ( the Turkish spelling of \u201d jihad \u201d ) just to provoke people.

        "At the end of April, as the world cleaned up wrapping paper and pine leaves and prepared to say to 2015, the Jewish community had its own bittersweet celebration : Kristan Williams released Anything For You, the fourth and final title in her second and wildly popular Mother Heron series. The first book, The Best Man, led us to Faith Johnson and her family, owners of the famous Heron vineyard in fictional Manningsport, New Hampshire. Faith was jilted at the altar, then transported to the West Coast.",
        "Eat more when you \u2019 re tired? You \u2019 re not alone. More than a third of the children in a national survey sponsored by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the UCLA School of Public Health said they change their diets during stressful periods. And many of us are going to turn to either sugary drinks or highly refined carbohydrates such as bagels or smoked pasta when the stress hits. \u201d There can be a sort of a vicious cycle, \u201d says David Ludwig, a professor of pediatrics and nutrition at Harvard University and a researcher at Boston Children \u2019 s Hospital.",
        "Turning 16 is considered a milestone. In many states, it means being able to work, pay taxes and live like an adult. In Washington, D. C. could even take on another dimension : the right to vote in a presidential election. Michelle Jackson is helping lead the campaign to enfranchise teenagers in the nation \u2019 s media. But she \u2019 s not your typical Washington politico. In D. C. the is better known as one of the top singers worldwide.",

Locals enjoy many things you can \u2019 t find including \u2014 campgrounds a quick drive from Aspen and gorgeous mountain peaks nearby. But in Butte, as in much of North America, advanced patient care is absent.

C. to Chicago and Miami workers called for a minimum wage increase to $15 an hour.

        "Hundreds of thousands of people drive for Uber in the U. S. The company has had fights in courts and city halls over the status of these drivers: Are they employees or contractors? Can they unionize? A fight that\u2019s gotten far less attention \u2014 one that may affect drivers far more \u2014 is the competition between Uber and its main rival, Lyft. Competition for drivers is so great that, about a year ago, Uber sent covert operatives into Lyft cars \u2014 to recruit. Isabella was one of these covert operatives. \u201dI don\u2019t really care Lyft versus Uber,\u201d she says.",

Each student delivered one line at a small lectern, and then the class sang songs from the civil rights era. This is the 14th year of the celebration. Listen to a clip here:",
        "It might seem unusual that a Taiwanese pop starlet could motivate legions of youth to troop to the polls and vote for the island\u2019s opposition party candidate. But she apparently did, and thereby helped Democratic Progressive Party leader Tsai become Taiwan\u2019s democratically first elected female leader. Chou popularly known as Tzuyu, is usually pictured prancing, bopping and singing in her South Korean girl band Twice\u2019s music videos. But in November, she made an apparently unpremeditated political statement by appearing on South Korean television, holding a Taiwanese national flag.",

        "After a torrent of criticism, Scholastic has decided to stop distributing A Birthday Cake for George Washington, a picture book about one of George Washington\u2019s slaves. The historical book tells the story of Hercules, a slave used by the president as his chef. It shows Hercules and his daughter Delia happy and taking pride in making Washington a birthday cake.

And essay in Kirkus noted that the book contained images of smiling slaves in almost every page.",
        "Hillary Clinton encountered rougher seas Sunday night in her latest meeting with her rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination. Both Sen. Bernard Sanders and former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley questioned her veracity and intensified their criticism of her policy positions and campaign financing. This was the last time these candidates will debate before the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1. But the mood of this meeting was more portentous than those of their previous three debates, if only because Iowa no longer looks like an easy win for Clinton. She has seen almost all her polling advantage vanish in that state.",
        "A feisty Bernie Sanders defended his positions on gun control and his newly released health care plan in Sunday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate. Just two weeks before the Iowa caucuses, the NBC News debate had a new urgency, with the Vermont senator closing the gap with Hillary Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire. The two had mostly held their punches in their previous meetings, but much of their differences were laid bare during the in Charleston, S. C.",
        "The fourth Democratic debate was as raucous an event as we\u2019ve seen from the Democrats. With Clinton\u2019s lead narrowing in the polls, Sanders had the spotlight. He was energetic and quick to the draw offering unapologetic defenses of his policies: Break up the banks, kill superPACs, enact universal health care. Clinton played the realist, promising gradual work on health care and a continuation of the Obama administration. Sanders played the idealist promising a political revolution. He also produced a when Clinton questioned his commitment to Obama. With little success, O\u2019Malley tried to stay in the debate.",
        "Plenty of politicos and pundits have rationalized Donald Trump\u2019s political ascent as the result of his enormous popularity among white voters. No doubt Trump is by many Republicans, but his real strength is among those without a bachelor\u2019s degree. In that demographic, most polls show the is trouncing his Republican rivals. In fact, the main reason Trump is leading national polls is because he dominates the white world. That got us thinking: How powerful are white voters who don\u2019t have college degrees? And what role do they play in the GOP of today versus the GOP of yesterday?",
        "When she was in fifth grade, Regina Mason received a school assignment that would change her life: to connect with her country of origin. That night, she went home and asked her mother where they were from. \u201dShe told me about her grandfather who was a former slave,\u201d Mason tells Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross. \u201dAnd that blew me away, because I\u2019m thinking, \u2019Slavery was like biblical times. It wasn\u2019t just a few generations removed.\u2019 \u201d But for Mason, slavery was a few generations removed.",
        "Biggest, fastest, highest, most \u2014 it\u2019s hard to talk about The Force Awakens without superlatives. No question the Force is strong with this one at the box office. But would it surprise you to learn that despite all the records it\u2019s been setting, The Force Awakens went into this holiday weekend as only the third biggest Star Wars movie in terms of attendance? Or as cute as that adorable soccer ball with personality is, just as many millions of people have gone \u201dawwwww\u201d at the puppies in 101 Dalmatians? The Force Awakens is big, make no mistake, but biggest?",
        "Space is hard. We were reminded of that yesterday when SpaceX tried to land a Falcon 9 rocket on a barge in the Pacific. If you remember, SpaceX made history when another Falcon 9 successfully launched a satellite into orbit and then navigated back down to Earth, landing safely on solid ground. SpaceX had tried once before to land a rocket on a platform in the ocean but that failed pretty spectacularly. On Sunday, the Falcon 9 delivered a satellite into orbit and it came super close to sticking the landing on water.",

I could not follow.\u201d Fields was worried she had suffered a stroke or was showing signs of early dementia. Instead she found out she had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.

        "When I kick back to watch a show, I tell myself I\u2019m just going to watch one episode. But 45 minutes later, I\u2019m watching another. And then another. For the rest of the day. There are a lot of things that TV and chilling can lead to, but among the less fun? Maybe more cognitive decline over time. Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco checked in with 3, 247 people for 25 years, starting when they were young adults. Every five years, they asked participants to estimate how much TV they watched daily.",
        "There\u2019s a new deli in rural Maine with a hotshot chef behind the counter. Foodies may know Matthew Secich\u2019s name from stints and stars earned at Charlie Trotter\u2019s, The Oval Room in Washington, D. C. and The Alpenhof Lodge in Jackson Hole, Wyo.

        "At one high school in Maryland, fears of deportation are playing out in the classroom. In Prince George\u2019s County, a suburb of Washington, D. C. about 70 percent of the students at High Point High School are Latino. It\u2019s a student population that\u2019s prompted the school\u2019s principal, Sandra Jimenez, to term it \u201dCentral American Ellis Island.\u201d Principal Jimenez says the fear of deportation raids is making many immigrant students scared to come to school, despite assurances from government officials that there are no raids happening at schools.
