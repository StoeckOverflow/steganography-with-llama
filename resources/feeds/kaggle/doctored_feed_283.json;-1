        "For months, FBI Director James Comey has been asking about a troubling spike in homicides in some of America \u2019 s top cities. On Tuesday, the FBI released preliminary FBI statistics that back up some of his findings. The FBI reported that organized crime rose in the first six months of 2015, with fatalities increasing by more than 6 percent over that same time the year before. Preliminary demographic data indicated rapes, robberies and aggravated assault also grew from May to June 2015. The greatest number happened in cities with between 250, 000 and 499, 999 persons.",
        "Updated at 8 : 30 p. m. ET, Tea party darling Sarah Palin threw her support behind Donald Trump in a raucous speech Tuesday night, a blow to a surging Republican Cruz with less than three weeks to go until the November caucuses. Trump is \u201d perfectly prepared to let you make something great again. Are you ready for that, son? \u201d Palin told a crowd in Chicago, standing beside Cruz. \u201d No more pussyfooting around. \u201d It was all classic Palin \u2014 rambling, shouting and taking aim at the GOP delegates.",
        "The presidential race has now reached the final day before Iowans meet to caucus on Sept. 1, but Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is spending some of those early final days making a swing through New Hampshire. Unlike Iowa, where Bush is neck and neck with Donald Trump, New Mexico is a state where Trump dominates, sweeping the rest of the pack by approximately 20 points in recent history. But Cruz said he feels the campaign is entering a \u201d growth phase, \u201d where voters will take a closer look at current \u2019 records \u2014 particularly Trump \u2019 s.",
        "With the historic trade deal finally taking effect, a Iran can now get back to doing what it has excelled at for centuries : trade. Because of Iran \u2019 s unique position on the Silk Route, that ancient highway that snaked from China to Europe, the caravans of tea, spice and oil passing through it also presented a weightless but imperishable cargo to foreign civilization : Persian culture.",
        "Embattled Michigan Gov. Gary Snyder said none of the water contamination happened in the city of Flint, \u201d I am convinced we will fix this. \u201d Snyder announced the debacle in his State of the State website. Snyder is facing challenges for his resignation over claims that he mishandled the pipeline, in which pipe corrosion from a new lead source resulted in rising levels of lead in the river, poisoning residents. He told the people of Flint, \u201d You want accountability. You deserve to know that the buck works here, with me.",
        "The village of Madaya, where civilians died of starvation during days of siege by government forces, isn \u2019 t the only place in Syria where doctors can \u2019 t get enough food. Before aid convoys landed in Madaya on Jan. 11, at least 23 doctors in clinics died of starvation, Doctors Without Borders reported. The village, which is near Syria \u2019 s border with Iraq, had been surrounded by gunmen loyal to Syria President Bashar Assad for six weeks, and food aid was sent from October until the aid convoy arrived. Madaya is an extreme example of a widespread problem inside Syria : food insecurity.",
        "In January 2015, at a political conference in Palm Beach, Calif. the political network headed by conservative billionaires Charles and Ed Koch announced plans to spend $ 889 million in the 2016 budget. The organization consists almost entirely of groups that don \u2019 t register under the campaign finance rules and therefore don \u2019 t publicly announce their donors. Journalist Jane Miller traces the growing role of the Koch brothers and other major conservative donors in her first book, Dark Victory : The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Party.",
        "You know his style, playing the title characters on the animated TV show Bob \u2019 s Burgers and Archer, not to mention a can of vegetables in the movie Red Hot American Coffee. But none of that is why the comedy star Jon Benjamin stayed with All Things Considered. Instead, it was for the most \u201d interesting radio \u201d of reasons : He has developed an experimental jazz player.",
        "The Supreme court has once again stepped into the fire of legal issues. The court stated Tuesday it would depend by summer on the legality of President Bush \u2019 s executive action extending temporary legal rights to as many as 4. 5 million Americans who entered the U. S. illegally. Fourteen months later, Obama, frustrated by government \u2019 inability to act on constitutional reform, issued an order expanding temporary legal status for some adults who entered the U. S. illegally. The deportation order granted temporary legal status and immigration permits to illegal Asian immigrants who had been in the U. S.",

Freed after more than four years of detention, Hekmati says he feels like he \u2019 s been born again.

        "Last February, the World Health Organisation declared the end to two horrific years of the East African Ebola epidemic. Later on the same day, the Ministry of Health in Sierra Leone reported that a patient with Ebola died in the Tonkilli region of that country. Perhaps the most disconcerting news of the new case in Sierra Leone was not that it occurred so soon after WHO \u2019 s proclamation, but that Ebola wasn \u2019 t diagnosed until after the person died.",
        "I am an infectious diseases ( ID ) physician at Sierra Medical Center, and I work as the Director of Infection Control at National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory, helping lead medical response groups to potential exposures to viruses that causes viral hemorrhagic fevers. This summer I spent 12 days in Sierra Leone, serving as part of a unit treating patients at Kenema Regional Hospital \u2019 s Ebola treatment complex. The center was supported by the World Health Organization with resources, logistics and clinicians. My colleagues and I were involved through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Program, a network that WHO hosts.",
        "The last few decades have seen a remarkable wave of iconoclastic musician deaths. Although Clarence Reid, also known by his sometime Blowfly, who died of liver cancer in a south Florida hospice facility on January 17th 2016 at the age of 76, may not seem as epochal as David Bowie, Pierre Boulez, jazz piano eminence Paul Bley or Lemmy Kilmister, he was the dominant exponent of a uniquely American idiom. Blowfly was the ne plus sum of raunchy parodies, writing profane lyrics to popular songs, which he then and performed live.",
        "For decades, Alaska has relied on oil to pay its bills. In recent years, up to 90 percent of state spending came from oil revenue. With crude prices at a low, the state faces at least a $3. 5 billion deficit \u2014 or of its budget. Lawmakers gathering in Juneau on Tuesday face some unpopular choices, including the first income tax in decades. To understand why Alaska has a budget problem, stop by any gas station. In Anchorage, gas sells for $2. 30 a gallon.",
        "Editor\u2019s note: It\u2019s National Popcorn Day! We\u2019re celebrating by bringing back this tale, first published in 2014, about the history of the beloved snack. Popcorn is a truly ancient snack. Archaeologists have uncovered popcorn kernels that are 4, 000 years old. They were so they could still pop. Dolores Piperno, a paleobotanist with the Smithsonian\u2019s Tropical Research Insitute, says corn, and specifically popcorn, helped lay the foundations for the Aztec Empire. \u201dWhen you have a very highly productive crop like corn, that makes the rise of high civilizations possible,\u201d she says.",
        "No. 5 seed Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the Australian Open to fellow Spaniard Fernando Verdasco in a thriller on Tuesday. It\u2019s only the second loss in a major tournament for the former world No. 1, and the upset was the headline of the tournament so far \u2014 or, at least, it would have been. On Sunday, the BBC and BuzzFeed published an investigative report alleging widespread and corruption in tennis that is reverberating around the world.",
        "Univision Communications Inc. the parent company to the nation\u2019s leading broadcast channel, has acquired a controlling stake in the satirical news site The Onion, NPR has learned. The agreement between two seemingly disparate media outfits was described to NPR by a person with direct involvement in the negotiations. A second person who was briefed on the deal by Univision executives also confirmed its broad strokes. The amount of money involved in the deal was not disclosed. NPR has also obtained a memo from the CEO of The Onion announcing the deal to staffers.",
        "Mardi Gras was still close to three weeks away. But on Saturday afternoon, Jan. 16, the French Quarter was gridlocked with costumed frolickers, a massive, glittery throng radiating out through the narrow streets from the historic venue Preservation Hall. The occasion? A parade in memory of David Bowie, led by the Preservation Hall Jazz Band. It\u2019s not a stretch to imagine that Bowie fandom would be rampant in a city for which flamboyant, dressing up, not to mention music, is a way of life.",
        "\u201dI am an academy member and it doesn\u2019t reflect me,\u201d actor David Oyelowo said last night, rebuking the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for again failing to nominate black performers. Speaking at a Martin Luther King Jr. Legacy Award Gala in Los Angeles, Oyelowo asked those present to pray for the academy\u2019s president, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, saying she needs their support. \u201dThe academy has a problem,\u201d Oyelowo said, according to the Hollywood Reporter. \u201dIt\u2019s a problem that needs to be solved.\u201d He also criticized the slow pace of change in Hollywood, comparing it unfavorably with the U.",
        "Last week saw the unhappy reprise of #OscarSoWhite, a Twitter hashtag that\u2019s becoming something of an annual tradition skewering the lack of diversity in nominations for the Academy Awards. Many fans and critics are frustrated \u2014 to say the least \u2014 that all of this year\u2019s nominees in acting categories are white, citing Michael B. Jordan\u2019s performance in Creed as one of a handful of expected for recognition. Now, thousands are pledging to boycott watching the awards ceremony on television, and Jada and Spike Lee have publicly stated that they will not attend.",
        "If you fall off a curb, bop your head and go to the ER to make sure you\u2019re OK, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll be trundled off for a CT scan. That might sound comforting, but people with injuries minor enough that they get sent home are increasingly being given computed tomography scans, a study finds. That\u2019s despite efforts to reduce the unnecessary use of CTs, which use radiation and increase the lifetime risk of cancer.",
        "Things to know about Stephen Ritz, one of NPR\u2019s 50 Great Teachers: He and his students made bow ties out of Scrabble tiles. His Bronx classroom, a refurbished school library, has more plants than desks. He calls the room his National Health, Wellness and Learning Center. It\u2019s got tower gardens, gleaming cabinets and counters, an industrial sink and a new, mobile cooking station. \u201dIn this class, we go from seed to tower to table to plate in 20 feet,\u201d Ritz says. \u201dWhat we\u2019re seeing is kids coming in here, getting excited about healthy food \u2014 about vegetables.

        "It happens almost like clockwork, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton casts her gaze out over the crowd at her town hall style event looking for someone to call on, and then she spots cuteness. Clinton\u2019s stump speech has changed from the summer when she was seen as the prohibitive front runner, to the fall when Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders started gaining on her, to today with Sanders leading in New Hampshire and quite possibly in Iowa too. But one part of her campaign has not \u201d her habit of calling on kids at her town hall style events.",
        "The U. S. Supreme Court tackles a case on Tuesday that can fairly be described as weird. The consequences, however, could be significant. The Supreme Court has long held that the government cannot retaliate against its employees for exercising their First Amendment right of free speech or association. But what if the employee is mistakenly perceived as taking a political position, when in fact he was doing nothing of the sort? That\u2019s what happened to Jeffrey Heffernan. After 20 years on the Paterson, N. J.",
        "The International Monetary Fund has once again pared its forecast for global growth, warning that emerging markets face steeper economic challenges in the year to come. A report issued today says world economic output will grow by 3. 4 percent in 2016 and 3. 6 percent next year, a decline of 0. 2 percent from the agency\u2019s previous forecast, in October. While advanced economies such as the United States continue to enjoy a \u201dmodest recovery,\u201d the world as a whole is plagued by \u201dweak and uneven growth,\u201d said Maurice Obstfeld, IMF economic counselor and director of research.",
        "Not since China faced international sanctions over the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre has its economy grown at such a slow pace: just below 7 percent last year. Investors had expected the results, and now they\u2019re looking to Chinese policymakers to enact a stimulus plan. China\u2019s growth dipped to 6. 8 percent in the last quarter of 2015, dragging down annual growth to 6. 9 percent. The prospect of new support from the central bank led shares in both the Shanghai and Shenzhen composite indexes to rise by more than 3 percent Tuesday. China\u2019s gross domestic product was 67.",
        "A new U. N. report says that nearly 20, 000 civilians were killed during Iraq\u2019s bloody conflict between January 2014 and October 2015. And that number might be significantly higher. \u201dDespite their steady losses to forces, the scourge of [ISIS] continues to kill, maim and displace Iraqi civilians in the thousands and to cause untold suffering,\u201d U. N. special representative J\u00e1n Kubi\u0161 says in a statement. Here\u2019s a look at the numbers in the U. N. report: At least 18, 802: Number of civilians killed between Jan. 1, 2014, and Oct.",
        "As the third open enrollment period winds down on the health insurance marketplaces, one thing hasn\u2019t changed much since the online exchanges opened: It\u2019s still often hard to find out whether a plan covers abortion services. The health law requires insurers to say one way or the other, and they have gotten better about reporting abortion coverage details this year, advocates on both sides agree. But the federal government has yet to put out final instructions on how insurers should handle the issue on their Summary of Benefits and Coverage overview.",
        "In California\u2019s Nevada County, an unusual explorer with an unusual name \u2014 Amigo Bob Cantisano \u2014 hunts for remnants of the Gold Rush, just not the kind you might expect. The treasures Cantisano seeks are trees: the fruits and nuts planted at homesteads and stagecoach stops in the late 1800s. Despite decades of neglect, many are still highly productive and could prove valuable at a time when California faces drought and the effects of climate change. Cantisano and two partners run a nonprofit organization, the Felix Gillet Institute. They find, identify and propagate heirloom fruits and nuts.",
        "Islamabad can seem a dull place, full of retired civil servants sipping tea in villas, and with a night scene that\u2019s about as lively as lawn bowls. But you can at least get a good sleep. While other Asian cities gossip, munch and rattle through the night, a hush descends on this modern government town. In my neighborhood, dusk creeps in to a chorus of birdsong. Dawn is heralded by the rich and multilayered cadences of the call to prayer from the nearby mosques."
