        "As the issue of immigrants \u2014 legal or otherwise \u2014 political traction in the 2016 presidential election, there \u2019 s more evidence that illegal immigration is not only declining, but it \u2019 s been on a downward slope. \u201d The undocumented population has essentially undergone zero growth, \u201d writes Robert Warren, the author of a new report issued by the New Center for Migration Studies. \u201d The population has stopped decreasing because slightly more people are immigrants than are coming in from Mexico. \u201d In addition, the number of unauthorized immigrants is about 10. 9 percent, the lowest since 2003, according to Warren.",
        "The astronomer whose work helped steer Pluto out of the pantheon of planets says he has good reason to believe there \u2019 s an undiscovered object bigger than Earth located in the distant reaches of our solar system. That \u2019 s quite a relief, because Mike Brown of Caltech is no exception to this part of our cosmic system. After all, he discovered Eris, an icy giant more massive than Pluto that proved our dear friend wasn \u2019 t special enough to be considered a planet.",
        "Today we receive news that scientists have uncovered that points to a way out beyond Neptune. If telescopes can verify its existence, it would become a big new planet in our star system. Scientists are, for now, referring to it as Planet Nine. We feel we \u2019 re getting ahead of ourselves, but we believe it deserves a better name. Should it be Plutoo? Or Plutwo? Yeah, we know you can do better. Gives us some suggestions \u2014 comes with an explanation if it \u2019 s super cerebral \u2014 in the comments.",
        "A few months later, Code Switch lead blogger Paul Demby turned to Twitter in an answer to a solution to a problem he \u2019 d been having. Gene had begun watching Premier League soccer but couldn \u2019 t agree on a rooting interest, so he asked the team \u2019 s fans to convince him to work for one team or another. In this episode of The Giant Foam Finger \u2014 our weekly offshoot of Pop Culture Rush Hour \u2014 I open by calling Gene for an update on his Major League search.",
        "Republican presidential candidate Ted Kennedy had a logistical dilemma in Iowa : how to house groups of volunteers from across the state for a month. The solution : a small business college campus in Des Moines that sleeps up to 100, also known as \u201d Camp City. \u201d The campaign is in the process of constructing a second dorm to house even more volunteers.",
        "For years, women cycled through one diet after another, each promising a sure time to lose weight. Along the way, Jenny Peterson, Weight Watchers and Lean Cuisine made millions off their diet programs and products. But it seems those days are over, according to industry analysts and nutritionists. \u201d Dieting is not a big word these days, \u201d said Susan Roberts, a professor of nutrition and psychiatry at Tufts University. \u201d [ Consumers ] equate the daily diet with deprivation, and they know deprivation doesn \u2019 t exist. \u201d According to Mintel, a market research firm, few people are eating diet products yet.",
        "It may look like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for Hillary Clinton \u2014 an insurgent candidate has erased her trail in Iowa just days before the Democratic caucuses. That \u2019 s what happened in 2008, when she finished a close third behind Barack Obama and John Kerry. Now, it \u2019 s Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has closed the race in the Hawkeye State. \u201d This feels like 2008 all over again, \u201d Iowa pollster J. Lynn Selzer said back in January after her survey showed Hillary up just 7 points back then. It \u2019 s getting closer now. And Sanders holds a lead in New York.",
        "Hillary Clinton walks a daily tightrope between leading Republicans and trumpeting her ability to negotiate with them. Republicans \u201d seem to be very power averse, \u201d she told me in an interview, soon after saying \u201d I \u2019 m interested in us solving problems right. \u201d I met the Democratic Party candidate in San Antonio, Texas, for a conversation before a banquet at a fancy hotel. We talked about immigration, the private party server she used as secretary of State, Iran, the upcoming Iowa caucuses, and many other issues. You can dig into the meat of our troubles here.",
        "Hillary finally dismissed a report that file she sent on her private data server contained a high level of classified information.",
        "Former Secretary of State and Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spoke with NPR \u2019 s Robert Shapiro in San Francisco. The transcript below has been edited for clarity. Bill Shapiro : I want to continue with the latest news about the secret email server that you installed as secretary of state, and a letter from the inspector general for the various agencies saying that there was something in some of these emails that exceeded top secret classification. Can you tell us any more details about how many emails there were, what they were about, whether they were read or received by you?",
        "A nearly unanimous Supreme Court review reinstated death penalty for three convicted mass murderers. The decision cast doubt on the impression that a majority of the justices would now be willing to strike down capital punishment in its entirety. Writing for the court, Justice Antonin Scalia revealed the gruesome details of the 2000 Wichita massacre, in which two brothers broke into a home at Christmastime, tortured eight young men and women, raped them repeatedly, caused them to commit sexual assaults on one another, then led them, naked, to a snowy field and shot them in the head.",
        "The U. S. Supreme Court struck down Florida \u2019 s death sentencing system as effective on Tuesday, casting limits on the status of all the state \u2019 s death sentences. Florida ranks second in the nation in the number of death row sentences, with 390 men and women already awaiting execution. Florida law allows juries in civil cases to recommend a sentence of death, or life in jail without parole \u2014 but it is the judge who is charged with finding death, and judges can and do frequently disregard the judge \u2019 s recommendation.",
        "As Iran wants to pump even more money into an already glutted market, that oversupply isn \u2019 t just making gas cheaper for your customers \u2014 it \u2019 s also causing Iranian fuel prices to fall down sharply. And that \u2019 s now pushing airfares down, too. \u201d We \u2019 re going about 14 to 15 percent lower this year than we have in the past, \u201d says Steve Surry of Hopper, a popular free smartphone app. Hopper, a startup in Boston, Mass.",
        "The turmoil on Wall Street showed no sign of letting up today, as complaints about the slowing global trend once again sent oil and steel prices tumbling. The Dow Jones industrial scale was down more than 500 points, a drop of 3. 5 points, at a little after noon ET, though it later rebounded sharply and ended the day down 249 points. Meanwhile, oil remained below $ 27 a barrel, a low. Both the public and the Standard Poor \u2019 s 500 businesses have now lost more than 10 percent of their value since the start of the recession.",
        "A 2014 report by the United Nations estimates that tens of millions of people in the world are currently enslaved. Most of them are in the developing world, where they work in mines, quarries or shrimp farms for no money and without hope of escape. \u201dSlavery is the complete control of one person by another, and violence is used to maintain that control in all forms of slavery,\u201d author Kevin Bales explains to Fresh Air\u2019s Dave Davies.",
        "At first blush, the FBI\u2019s national crime numbers for the first half of 2015 seem like bad news: Violent crime is up 1. 7 percent over the same period last year. With crime numbers, though, you have to look at the bigger context. Last year\u2019s increase was geographically uneven. The spikes have been higher in certain big cities, such as Los Angeles, but also, unexpectedly, in small towns and rural areas. In fact, murders were up 17 percent in communities with fewer than 10, 000 people. Violent crime went up in all regions, with the exception of the Northeast.",
        "The prime number has been discovered in Central Missouri \u2014 and oh, what a number it is. The record number, nicknamed M74207281, has more than 20 million digits. That\u2019s nearly 5 million digits longer than the previous record. If you printed each digit 1 mm wide, the number would stretch for more than a half marathon\u2019s 13. 2 miles. Or as standupmaths reports, we\u2019re talking about 2, 567 killer whales stretched out . So how can a number be \u201ddiscovered\u201d? It happens when a human notices.",
        "Among the 30 victims of Friday\u2019s attack on a hotel and restaurant in Burkina Faso was Leila Alaoui, a photographer known best for her powerful portraits of Moroccans and intimate, sensitive images of migrants and the displaced. She and her driver, Mahamadi Ouedraogo, were shot outside a restaurant in the capital, Ouagadougou. Alaoui, 33, was based in Marrakech, Morocco, and Beirut and had traveled to Burkina Faso, a country in West Africa, for an assignment covering women\u2019s rights for Amnesty International. She studied photography at the City University of New York and exhibited her work in Europe, the U.",
        "As the Democratic race in Iowa tightens, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is stepping up his political game \u2014 with a swanky campaign bus, a newfound eagerness to recite poll numbers, and an increasing tendency to throw political punches at Hillary Clinton. On Tuesday, he crisscrossed the roads of western Iowa in an intense bus tour.",
        "It\u2019s not rare for a year to break record temperatures. But it\u2019s now happened two years in a row \u2014 and 2015 was \u201dvery, very clearly the warmest year by a long chalk,\u201d says Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. NASA is presenting the annual review of global average temperatures in conjunction with NOAA, which says that not only did 2015 finish as the warmest year on record, but it did so by the widest margin ever \u2014 nearly a third of 1 degree Fahrenheit warmer than 2014\u2019s average.",
        "The Senate Agriculture Committee has voted in support of a compromise plan that will preserve key school nutrition standards enacted after the passage of the Healthy, Kids Act in 2010. Yep, that\u2019s the law that requires schools to serve up more fruits, vegetables and whole grains. It also paved the way for major reductions in salt. These stricter standards have led to more healthful meals. A study published in JAMA Pediatrics earlier this month concluded that the nutritional quality of school meals has increased by about 30 percent, as children consume more vitamins and fiber and slightly fewer calories.",
        "Some 700 American troops on a deployment could be in danger of an attack by extremists affiliated with the Islamic State, the Pentagon worries, but it may not be able to get them out anytime soon. U. S. military commanders fear the soldiers deployed in Egypt\u2019s Sinai Peninsula, and charged with keeping the peace between Egypt and Israel, are becoming an irresistible target for Islamist fighters concentrating nearby. The Wilayat Sinai group has pledged allegiance to ISIS, attacked Egyptian troops and planted roadside bombs.",
        "New satellite images of St. Elijah\u2019s Monastery, located in the city of Mosul, no longer show a neatly chiseled, square parcel of land, complete with walls and buildings built into a hill. All that can be seen of the Christian monastery, parts of which are 1, 400 years old, is a dusty field of rubble. It was apparently razed by ISIS in its quest to destroy religious or historical artifacts deemed heretical.",
        "It\u2019s our first show with new music in 2016! After nearly two months of \u2019s, holiday and Sweet 16 specials, we get back to doing what we do best and love most: playing great new music. On this week\u2019s All Songs Considered, we share a new song by Tiny Desk alum AURORA, one of Bob\u2019s favorite discoveries from CMJ 2014. In a departure from the soft, whispered folk sounds of her early recordings, we showcase a song from Laura Gibson\u2019s upcoming, electrified record Empire Builder.",
        "The publication of a new history of autism called In a Different Key, by John Donvan and Caren Zucker, has reopened an unsettling question about the pioneering Viennese pediatrician Hans Asperger: Was he a Nazi sympathizer, or a man who paid lip service to his bosses\u2019 murderous ideology in order to save the lives of as many of his young patients as possible? The implications of this question are because Asperger\u2019s work on autism at the University of Vienna in the 1930s was ignored for decades after the war.",
        "In their book published this month, In a Different Key: The Story of Autism, journalists John Donvan and Caren Zucker delve into the history of the good and bad intentions, sometimes wrongheaded science and shifting definitions that can cloud our understanding of what has come to be called the autism spectrum. In their Tuesday conversation with NPR\u2019s Robert Siegel, host of All Things Considered, Donvan and Zucker tell of a particularly dark period in the 1940s when psychiatrists blamed autistic behavior on \u201drefrigerator mothers\u201d \u2014 emotionally distant women who, supposedly, didn\u2019t love their children enough.",
        "Being in Kaikoura, New Zealand, for what is allegedly the first astrobiology workshop here, it\u2019s a good time to go back to the basics and reflect on what we know of the complicated question of the origin of life on Earth \u2014 and the possibility of life elsewhere. I will do this, here at 13. 7, in installments during the next few weeks. When it comes to life in the universe, we have only one undisputed sample point \u2014 Earth.",
        "High lead levels in Flint, Mich. \u2019s water has led President Obama to declare a state of emergency, as criticism mounts that the problem has not been handled promptly. \u201dThe people weren\u2019t put first, the health of the people was not put before profit and money,\u201d Flint Mayor Karen Weaver says in an interview with Ari Shapiro on All Things Considered. The problem started when Flint switched its water source to the Flint River in April 2014. The new supply was harder water, which corroded the city\u2019s pipes and leached lead into the tap water.",
        "Pedrito Martinez is a percussionist \u2014 a rumbero called upon by many jazz and pop stars when they need hand drumming, as well as a singing bandleader in his own right. He\u2019s also a Santer\u00eda priest. Those two aspects of Martinez\u2019s life are inextricably connected. In 2014, when we documented the new suite of music that Wynton Marsalis had written to feature Martinez and Cuban piano virtuoso Chucho Vald\u00e9s, we spoke with Martinez about his practice of the religion, and followed him to a private ceremony in The Bronx.",
        "Building on the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra\u2019s recent trip to Cuba, managing and artistic director Wynton Marsalis presents his newest work: Ochas, a suite for big band and percussion. He calls upon young superstar Pedrito Martinez, who brought along a trio of fellow hand percussionists, to execute the chants and rhythms of the bat\u00e1 drums specific to Santer\u00eda religious practice. And he called upon virtuoso Cuban pianist Chucho Vald\u00e9s to ignite the proceedings. The performance launches Jazz at Lincoln Center\u2019s calendar and highlights its theme \u201dJazz Across The Americas.\u201d All compositions by Wynton Marsalis."
