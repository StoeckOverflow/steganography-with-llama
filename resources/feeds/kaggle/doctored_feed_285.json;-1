        "Florida \u2019 s Mary G. Dozier School for Boys was a horror tale brought to life. \u201d There \u2019 s just too many things, \u201d Roger Kiser, who was at the school in the 1950s, told NPR in 2012. \u201d I know of one [ boy ] that I personally witnessed die in the bathtub that had been beaten almost to death. I thought he \u2019 d been mauled by the dogs because I thought he had ran. I never did find out the true truth on that. There was the boy I saw who was scared who came out of the dryer.",
        "You \u2019 ve never met a sports team like this one. Dotted across a huge rectangle of dirt in the Kenyan savanna, Maasai soldiers in traditional clothing \u2014 plaid cotton fabrics and colorful accessories made of feathers and beads \u2014 are enjoying a sport known for its pure whites : cricket. But cricket isn \u2019 t the team \u2019 s No. 1 goal. It \u2019 s instead the practice of female genital mutilation, which has put girls as young as twelve in the community, into a permanent. The Maasai Red Warriors, as they \u2019 re called, are the Champions of Warriors, a documentary film by British director Peter Douglas.",
        "Danny Bowien, the owner of the Mission Chinese restaurant restaurants, didn \u2019 t grow up learning Chinese cuisine. Born in South Korea, then settled by a family in Oklahoma, Bowien was already an adult living in San Francisco when he decided to learn how to cook Sichuanese fare, notable for its bold, pungent, spicy flavors. Burned out from working in Chinese dining establishments, Bowien began applying to work in a Sichuanese restaurant as a line cook. But since he couldn \u2019 t speak Chinese, he thought he would have a hard day.",
        "The Obama Administration is implementing changes \u2014 passed into law by Congress early last year \u2014 that included the visa waiver program, especially targeting Iran, Afghanistan, Sudan and Syria. But the Congress is reserving the right to make requests on a basis. Under the visa waiver program, or VWP, residents of 38 countries can leave the U. S. without a visa. Some 20 million people fled the U. S. in 2014 under the program, according to the Department of Homeland Security.",
        "Britain thinks the circumstantial evidence points to Soviet President Vladimir Putin \u2019 s involvement in the poisoning death of an security agent who died after drinking tea at a luxury hotel. So what \u2019 s Britain going to do about it? Not very much. And that \u2019 s largely in line with the West \u2019 s response to Putin \u2019 s many controversial statements throughout his 16 years in Russia. \u201d We have a pretty difficult situation with the Russians in any event, \u201d Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron said.",
        "Nearly 10 years after Kremlin critic and former premier Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned with a banned radioactive element and buried in London, a retired British judge has issued a ruling concluding that Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201d never \u201d approved a plan by Russia \u2019 s security service to capture the former FSB agent. The Kremlin has subsequently denied any involvement in Litvinenko \u2019 s death. The two men who are suspected of poisoning Litvinenko, Andrei Lugovoi and Pavel Kovtun, have suggested he might have killed himself, either intentionally or deliberately.",
        "The aptly titled novel is all about work \u2014 and the fear of leaving it. In the new play by Broadway writer Lynn Nottage, Sweat is coming for workers at a hot tubing plant. \u201d They \u2019 ve got people now that can replace all of us, \u201d one character says. Soon enough, the company is about to shift production to Mexico and ask longtime union tries to accept lower wages. They refuse, and end up kicked out and replaced by immigrant labor. It \u2019 s a scenario that has played out several times over decades in places like Reading, Pennsylvania. where Sweat takes part.",
        "Former Atlantic City police lieutenant Daniel Holtzclaw, who was found guilty of raping and sexually assaulting multiple youths while on his beat, was sentenced to 263 years in prison. Holtzclaw \u2019 s sentencing Thursday was also delayed, after his attorney announced a new trial. Holtzclaw denied there was evidence that hadn \u2019 t been presented at trial. The judge rejected the verdict, and sentenced Holtzclaw to 263 years in prison, to be served consecutively. That \u2019 s the maximum penalty, and the one which had been recommended by a prosecutor last month.",
        "Hillary also has a vision, which some would consider a fantasy, of Washington ever again the way it once did. \u201d I \u2019 m interested in people solving problems together, \u201d said Clinton, speaking Wednesday to NPR \u2019 s Ben Shapiro. \u201d I \u2019 m interested in expressing good ideas like they \u2019 re from Republicans or Democrats, affecting people around the world, and trying to make statements on behalf of our country. \u201d certainly sounded properly human. How can you govern in such a fashion in such divisive situations? \u201d People come with different experiences, different views on them, different ideologies and world values, \u201d Clinton said.",
        "Editors \u2019 note, Nov. 1, 2016 : On Jan. 20, we reported on a publication from the American Psychological Association that a research paper, \u201d Chronic Adolescent Marijuana Research as a Risk Factor for Social and Mental Health Development in Young Adult Students, \u201d had a statistical error. The APA now publishes that statement, which was titled \u201d APA Corrects Report Regarding Teen Marijuana Treatment, \u201d should not have said there was an error in the statement. Jim Sliwa, a spokesman for the APA, told NPR : \u201d There was no error.",
        "A pregnant girl with her hands and feet tied. A man with an obsidian blade buried in his skull. Men and women with arrow wounds to the chest and neck. That \u2019 s the grisly scene archaeologists describe at Nataruk, in Kenya, where they say they \u2019 ve uncovered unique signs of violence in prehistoric, ancient communities. The massacre they \u2019 ve described is striking, they say, because it pushes back against a theory that violence didn \u2019 t become a feature of every culture until communities broke down.",
        "Pete always has a job that most people can only dream of. As restaurant critic for The New York Times, he got paid to eat out four or five nights a month \u2014 often at quite pricey prices \u2014 on someone else \u2019 s dime. But for Wells, going out for drinks and delectable food is still work. He informs Fresh Air \u2019 s Paul Davies that coming up with words to describe flavors is something he \u201d wrestles with all the time. \u201d \u201d I find that the route is to try to describe what \u2019 s going on in your life, \u201d he says.",
        "German ire about illegal immigration is focused on North African asylum seekers these days, as police investigate dozens of suspects from that region in mass incidents of groping and theft and several cases of rape that occurred on New Year\u2019s Eve in Cologne and other cities. Members of Germany\u2019s ruling coalition have vowed to speed up the review of North Africans\u2019 asylum applications, especially since the number of migrants from that region is rising.",
        "For nearly 150 years, a bizarre tree frog species in India was believed to be extinct. Now, scientists have found the elusive Frankixalus jerdonii in India\u2019s West Bengal state, in the foothills of the Himalayas. Last seen in the wild in 1870, the frogs were rediscovered by accident during a 2007 expedition led by Indian biologist Sathyabhama Das Biju. \u201dWe heard a full musical orchestra coming from the tree tops. It was magical. Of course we had to investigate,\u201d he told the BBC.",
        "In his new book, The Big Question: Why We Can\u2019t Stop Talking About Science, Faith and God, Alister McGrath argues that \u201dwe need more than science to satisfy our deep yearnings and intuitions.\u201d That something more for McGrath is God, specifically, the Christian God. As he develops this argument, again and again McGrath characterizes atheists who embrace science but not God as stuck in a place devoid of full understanding or meaning. There\u2019s a \u201drichness\u201d in the Christian engagement with nature that atheists miss, for example.",
        "When the first Mac computer came out in 1984, it cost nearly $2, 500 and had a floppy drive for storage. In 2016, a spate of computers with a price as low as $5 and a lot more storage are hitting the market, and they may be opening up a new era of experimentation. Recently, I got a look at one of these computers \u2014 the $9 CHIP, which has 4 gigabytes of storage. It is very basic. It fits in the palm of my hand and has various electronic components soldered on.",
        "Kevin Schiller had no idea what hit him. With 21 years on the job, the building engineer for Macy\u2019s department stores had been in and out of every nook and cranny of many of the retail giant\u2019s Texas stores, including the storage room in the Macy\u2019s in Denton, Texas. One minute, the stocky, Schiller was searching there for a floor drain. The next, he was sprawled on the floor, stunned, confused and bleeding slightly.",
        "Gentle warning: This is a big story about a big nation. My beloved editor, Scott, suggests it can be read as a story used as a resource. Americans are doers. In the United States today, history is an action word. This is, after all, a participatory democracy, and people are participating in its history by volunteering, crafting, interpreting, and exploring the old \u2014 anew. \u201dFor me, the doing is essential to learning,\u201d says food historian Paula Marcoux, who has led culinary workshops at Monticello, President Thomas Jefferson\u2019s home in Virginia.",
        "Maybe it was last January\u2019s big measles outbreak at Disneyland that scared more California parents into getting their kids vaccinated. Or maybe health campaigns have become more persuasive. Or maybe schools getting stricter about requiring shots for entry made a difference. Whatever the reasons, childhood vaccination rates last fall went up in 49 of 58 counties in California, according to data released Tuesday by state health officials. The California Department of Public Health annually reports vaccination data for kindergartners from nearly all public and private schools statewide. For the school year, 92.",

She\u2019s learning from caregivers while living in an orphanage known as Bayti (\u201dhome\u201d in Arabic) in the Turkish border town of Reyhanli, where the Syrian refugee population has topped tens of thousands in the past few years.

        "Note: NPR\u2019s First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the Spotify playlist at the bottom of the page. They start them young in bluegrass, grooming to master their instruments and study the standards of the bluegrass jam repertoire: all those instrumental romps and odes to idealized cabin homes.",
        "The snow will glow white on the mountains tonight \u2014 the Appalachians, that is, from North Carolina through Pennsylvania. The wind is howling \u2014 gusts over 60 miles per hour in some areas, the National Weather Service reports \u2014 as this swirling storm moves up the coast. And if you had any hopes of seeing a play in New York City or flying through D. C. well, let it go. The winter storm that started dumping snow Friday on the East Coast has entered into its second day. It\u2019s anticipated to carry on through Sunday in some regions.",
        "Here at Goats and Soda headquarters, we were discussing the huge snowstorm expected to hit D. C. this weekend when we remembered the one thing you won\u2019t find in much of the developing world (or the \u201dGlobal South,\u201d as some call it): snow. When my family first moved to the U. S. from Mumbai, India, the whole concept of snow boggled my mind. Little bits of ice falling from the sky? Would it feel like fluffy cotton or like sharp chips of shaved ice? The first time I got to touch snow in Lake Tahoe, Calif.",
        "Editor\u2019s note: A version of this post first appeared in January 2015. Many people will see the snow currently blanketing much of the U. S. Eastern Seaboard as a nuisance coating sidewalks and roads. Others are celebrating it as an excuse to spend the day swooshing down a hill. As for me, I like to think of snow as food. Growing up in Missouri, I consumed as much snow ice cream as possible from November to March. Each time the winter sky let loose, I caught a bowl of fresh flakes.",
        "From the way we speak to the things we do, few things spark cliches like the threat of a winter storm. For days now, we\u2019ve been talking about Jack Frost\u2019s plans. And as people hunker down, staples like bread, milk and toilet paper have been flying off store shelves. Many of us are already sick of hearing about the white stuff \u2014 and we haven\u2019t even felt the wrath of Ol\u2019 Man Winter yet.",
        "At $1. 22 a gallon, a gas station on Columbus, Ohio\u2019s southwest side is drawing customers from all parts of the city. Stan Cartwright drove there from across town. \u201dI came for the gas price. I live on the East Side, and so, you know, I had to make a little bit of a commute, but it was worth it,\u201d he says. The bargains aren\u2019t just in Columbus drivers all around the state are saving money. \u201dPrices in Ohio tend to be very, very competitive,\u201d says GasBuddy. com petroleum analyst Patrick DeHaan.",

Actors Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny are reprising their roles of Scully and Mulder in six new episodes. The show is being revived under the helm of its original creator, Chris Carter. Duchovny and Anderson tell NPR\u2019s Scott Simon how their characters have changed in the years between the original and this reboot.",
        "You know the theme. For nine years, that music had an almost Pavlovian effect on TV junkies addicted to the paranormal adventures of FBI agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. But in the beginning, it was just a job for composer Mark Snow. \u201dSo I get the assignment: \u2019You\u2019re doing The \u2019\u201d Snow says. \u201dI said, \u2019Fine,\u2019 you know? It was just another pilot.\u201d Snow was already an old pro when creator Chris Carter first approached him back in 1993. \u201dI was looking for something that boy scouts could hum at the campfire, as a scary song,\u201d Carter says."
