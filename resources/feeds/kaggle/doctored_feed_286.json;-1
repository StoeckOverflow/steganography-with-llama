        "When The appeared on NBC in the 1990s, there really hadn \u2019 t been anything really like it on TV for a long time. The Twilight Zone, with its monsters and flying saucers and mentality, was an excellent inspiration and precursor. But instead of unusual or unearthly phenomena, dramatized in a TV series in ways that could be scary or funny, or both? As television shows go, that \u2019 s about as likely a sighting as Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster. The nearest thing to The before The was a TV film from the \u2019 70s called Kolchak : The Night Stalker.",
        "January is proving to be a slow month for ferry crossings. With rough waters whipped up by high wind, rubber rafts capsize, wooden bridges sink \u2014 and it \u2019 s cold. You never freeze in the water. But on Thursday morning last June, Vassilis Hantzopoulos has already seen 15 ships filled with asylum seekers on a long strip of sea separating Turkey from Greece and the rest of the European Union. Hantzopoulos, a specialist with the underfunded Hellenic Red Army, stands on a cliff and scans the horizon with binoculars.",
        "Something strange \u2014 and quite frightening \u2014 seemed to be happening with the Zika virus. For example Zika was a virus that turned up in Africa and occasionally in humans in Africa and Southeast Asia. Its symptoms were mild and the number of confirmed human cases was great. The first big outbreak was on the island of Yap in Micronesia. Three quarters of the island \u2019 s population were born \u2014 about 5, 000 people. But few of them reported any deaths. Things began to happen last year. The virus, which is spread by mosquitoes, turned up in Vietnam.",
        "UPDATE January 26, 11 : 52 a. m. : This time QA has ended. Watch a short version in the player above. In the recent year, Zika virus has risen as a serious health disease, linked to severe birth defects in Brazil. ABC \u2019 s South America Correspondent Lourdes and European Health Correspondent Jason Beaubien posted your questions on this disease in a new YouTube web chat on Tuesday, January 26, 11 a. m. p. Last week, look on one of the mothers who herself had Zika virus and whose baby was infected with microcephaly.",
        "Julia has a special \u2014 or is it? Ingrid Betancourt \u2019 s new film, The Blue Line, is about a girl in 1970s Argentina who can see the world through the eyes of others. However what she sees are terrible experiences, and that makes her different from the generation of Argentines who say they don \u2019 t know about the detentions, disappearances, tortures and actions by which Argentina \u2019 s military government ruled and quashed dissent in what is known as The Dirty War. Betancourt grew up in a liberal political family and was nominated for president when she was kidnapped by revolutionaries in 2002.",
        "When Sarah Palin endorsed Donald Trump for president this week, it was a surprise visit, but one that seemed remarkably logical. In fact, Donald Trump \u2019 s rise can be understood as a natural extension of the types of politics that Palin herself embraced after her unsuccessful run for vice president \u2014 combining populism, rage and power. Eight years later, Sarah Palin was still talking to the vast majority of Republicans outside of her home town.",
        "In just about every stump address he gives these days, Congressman turned presidential candidate Donald Trump can \u2019 t help using the phrase \u201d quiet majority. \u201d Sometimes he \u2019 ll ask the audience members if they \u2019 ve said it before and point out that it \u2019 s been around for a while. And then he \u2019 ll mention that the silent majority feels abused, or forgotten, or mistreated. And finally, toward the end of his speeches, Trump says that the silent majority is back.",
        "Anger continues to be the dominant emotion during this whole campaign. The angriest seem to be deeply \u2014 upset with everything from illegal immigration to ISIS to President Johnson. Donald Trump has stated he is proud to carry that mantle. But on the left, there \u2019 s a different mixture of frustration, disappointment and dissatisfaction with the political climate that is driving support to Vermont independent candidacy. Bernie Sanders. Staff at the Salem, N. C. field office for the Clinton campaign, volunteers busily working the phones, contacting registered voters and asking whom they intend to hire in next month \u2019 s elections.",
        "Following criticism over the lack of diversity in this year \u2019 s Oscar nominations, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has voted to support changes aimed at reducing the number of women and people of color in its membership by 2020. The board of governors unanimously supported a series of changes to \u201d make the Academy \u2019 s membership, its student bodies, and its voting systems significantly more diverse, \u201d the committee said in a statement. Salon \u2019 s Neda Ulaby reports that the academy convened an emergency meeting on Thursday night in response to reports of boycotts against this year \u2019 s awards show.",
        "Just say the title \u2014 his one name \u2014 and you know we \u2019 re talking about one of the most influential recording artists ever. Yanni \u2019 s resume includes more than 40 silver and gold albums since the 1980s and epic concerts from some of the world \u2019 s most historic sites, including The Forbidden City, the Taj Mahal, the Kremlin, and the Pyramids. Along the way, he may well have paid more money for PBS than Mickey the Grouch. Yanni \u2019 s new album, true to form, is called Sensuous Chill.",
        "The Larry rantings of @ berniethoughts would be the very incarnation of vacuum pennies. The mockery is all in awe and admiration, said John Spencer Madsen, who created the famous Twitter account chronicling the deep inner thoughts of the surging vice presidential candidate. It \u2019 s \u201d a very convincing portrayal of an imaginary Bernie Sanders in some parallel world where he has an obsession with food and beverages and a sort of childlike inability to discern thoughts from reality, \u201d explained Madsen.",
        "On the surface, Flint, Mich. and Kabwe, Zambia, don\u2019t seem to have a lot in common. They\u2019re half a world away from each other. One is a city of 99, 000 in one of the richest countries in the world. The other is a city of 203, 000 in a country. But there are a few threads of connection. Both were once bustling, industrial hubs, one dependent on the auto industry, the other on mining. Both were abandoned by the industry that once sustained them.",
        "Monkeys are clever and cute \u2014 or so the conventional wisdom in China has it. And therefore people see the Year of the Monkey, which begins on Feb. 8, as an auspicious time for making babies. The Year of the Goat, however, which is now coming to an end, has the opposite reputation. \u201dNine out of 10 babies born in the Year of the Goat are unlucky,\u201d goes an old Chinese saying. (While some translations have it as \u201dgoat,\u201d others render it as \u201dsheep\u201d or \u201dram.",
        "The shelves and desks at Teaching for Change in Washington, D. C. are full of picture books. For years, the nonprofit, which advocates for a more inclusive curriculum in public schools, has been keeping track of what it considers to be some of the best \u2014 and worst \u2014 multicultural children\u2019s books out there. Allyson Criner Brown, Teaching for Change\u2019s associate director, says they keep the bad ones because \u201dthere\u2019s so much to learn from them.\u201d A Birthday Cake for George Washington was just put on the bad shelf.",
        "As researchers have searched for ways to explain the childhood obesity epidemic in the U. S. many have posited that a child\u2019s race or ethnicity alone can put them at greater risk of becoming overweight or obese. Kim Eagle, a professor of internal medicine and health management and policy at the University of Michigan, was skeptical of this thinking. His hunch was that poverty was a much more important part of the equation.",
        "For many immigrants, coming to America is full of the unfamiliar \u2014 from the language to the food. In Philadelphia, a program aims to help these arrivals settle into their new country by folding English lessons into a cooking class. On a recent Wednesday afternoon, 20 recent immigrants and refugees to the United States streamed into a shiny kitchen on the fourth floor of the Free Library of Philadelphia\u2019s central branch. They were here to partake in the library\u2019s take on teaching English as a second language.",
        "Forgive us if you\u2019ve heard this (and heard it, and heard it) already: The East Coast is getting its fair share of snow this weekend. If you have, chances are you\u2019ve also heard another little anecdote. When folks get snowed in for a couple of days \u2014 the urban legend goes \u2014 the population in that area is likely to see a boost in births just nine months later. In other words: Blizzards might be prime time. Well, it turns out there\u2019s some truth to that \u2014 and the phenomenon may not be limited just to snow storms.",
        "The massive winter storm working its way up the East Coast has caused lots of headaches for humans \u2014 from impassable roadways to canceled flights to travel shutdowns. But it\u2019s brought nothing but delight to Tian Tian, the male giant panda at the National Zoo in Washington, D. C. The zoo posted a video on Saturday of Tian Tian making the most of his snow day. If you\u2019re concerned that he might be cold, zookeepers would like you to know that giant pandas have thick fur, and their native habitat in China features cold and snowy winters.",
        "A divorced New York businessman billionaire with a mixed political history and knack for controversy and grabbing the spotlight might run for president. Another one. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is again weighing a possible independent bid for the White House after seeing an opening in a chaotic and unpredictable 2016 race. The Democrat turned Republican turned independent is actively exploring a run, hiring consultants and commissioning a poll last month aimed at seeing whether there is an appetite for a candidate, a source familiar with Bloomberg\u2019s plans told NPR.",
        "With a little more than a week to go until the Iowa caucuses, the Des Moines Register endorsed Democratic former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio in the 2016 presidential race. The Hawkeye state\u2019s largest paper tweeted its choices Saturday night. The paper\u2019s editorial board focused on Clinton\u2019s resume in its endorsement, highlighting her experience, knowledge and skills as reasons why she is the \u201done outstanding candidate deserving of [Democrats\u2019] support. \u201dNo other candidate can match the depth or breadth of her knowledge and experience,\u201d it wrote.",
        "On campuses across the country, millions of students have an app called Yik Yak on their phones. It\u2019s like an anonymous version of Twitter. But because it\u2019s anonymous, it can get ugly and be a breeding ground for hate speech. Black student leaders across the country have held and protests asking college officials to block the app. Yik Yak, an social media app, has a presence on more than 2, 000 college campuses. Users of the app post comments anonymously, and anyone within a radius of a few miles can see, share and rate the comment.",
        "My patient grabbed my hand and told me that he was going to die. Just seconds before, the nurse had wheeled him into the resuscitation room. His blood pressure and heart rate were more than twice the normal levels. He was pale, clammy and gasping for breath. The nurses and doctors with me in the ER worked to stabilize him. We put an oxygen mask on his face. We inserted two IVs and began pumping fluids into his body. When his oxygen level dropped, we inserted a breathing tube.",
        "The Los Angeles Unified School District welcomed a new superintendent who represents a first for the nation\u2019s school district on Jan. 11. Michelle King is the first woman chosen for the job, heading more than 900 schools in the district. She is also an insider \u2014 she has worked in the system for three decades \u2014 unlike the string of outsiders who held the job before her. But she has largely stayed out of the spotlight, working behind the scenes from her various positions ranging from a classroom teacher to the in the district.",
        "It\u2019s easy to get cynical about the presidential campaign, especially so close to the first round of voting, when many candidates are on the attack. But see it up close and personal, and the process can feel a bit more charming. That\u2019s what a class from Indiana\u2019s Manchester University found as it traveled across Iowa last week, taking in the caucuses.",
        "While not everyone has seen Groucho Marx\u2019s films, many people would still recognize the comedian. His bushy black eyebrows, thick mustache and cigar have long been iconic. Marx was known for frequently taking aim at the rich and powerful in his comedies \u2014 but a new biography suggests a more sinister side to Julius \u201dGroucho\u201d Marx. \u201dThe conventional image of Groucho was that he was on the side of the little guy, and he spoke defiantly and insolently to powerful people and wealthy people,\u201d Lee Siegel, the author of Groucho Marx: The Comedy of Existence, tells NPR\u2019s Michel Martin.",
        "\u201d may be too young to die,\u201d muses Tim Sunblade, the narrator of Elliott Chaze\u2019s Black Wings Has My Angel. \u201dBut it isn\u2019t too young to die like a man.\u201d Tim has death on his mind frequently \u2014 he\u2019s an escaped prisoner determined to do whatever it takes to stay out of jail. He\u2019ll kill if he has to, and he\u2019d much rather wind up in a coffin than in a prison cell. This, of course, makes him very, very dangerous.",
        "Have you spent most of this election cycle trying to ignore it? We don\u2019t blame you. But with primary voting now well under way, it might be time. NPR\u2019s campaign reporters have spent months on the trail listening to and analyzing the candidates\u2019 movements, speeches and policy. But you don\u2019t need months, because three of those reporters \u2014 Tamara Keith, Don Gonyea and Sarah McCammon \u2014 have distilled what you need to know to just 100 words and 60 seconds.

        "Michael Oreskes joined NPR as its head of news at the end of April 2015. Since then, he has overseen extensive changes on air, as well as behind the scenes in the newsroom.

        "When John Peel died in October 2004 at age 65, the British radio host was known as one of the most voracious listeners in the world. But it was hard to know him well in the U. S. Tapes of his BBC broadcasts made their way to collectors hooked on his crisp, wry, delighted intros and outros and his boundless enthusiasm for all kinds of music.",
        "It was a tale of two defenses \u2014 and two very divergent outcomes \u2014 in the NFL\u2019s conference championship games Sunday. In the NFC, the Carolina Panthers stormed their way to a commanding victory over the Arizona Cardinals. Earlier in the day, in the AFC, the Denver Broncos narrowly survived a push from the New England Patriots to emerge with a win. The victories mean conference titles for the Panthers and the Broncos \u2014 and, more importantly, a trip to the Super Bowl for both teams."
