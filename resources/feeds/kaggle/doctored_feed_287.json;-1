        "Shovelful by shovelful, snowplow by snowplow, the East Glacier is digging its way out from behind an enormous winter snow that blanketed much of the region with up to 3 tons of snow. And as high wind and 36 hours of snow give way to clear sky and sunshine, some people are referring to the wintry landscape with glee. More and more streets are getting passable, as snow crews clear the roads \u2014 although officials in many regions still urge caution from driving.",
        "A massive snowstorm that destroyed most of the East Coast nearly ended Sunday afternoon, leaving in its wake dozens of snow over major cities, at least 18 casualties and heavy coastal flooding. While the wind has stopped, the weather might continue. High temperatures will create blowing and driving snow in some areas, the National Weather Service warned. And while New York officials lifted a travel ban on Sunday morning, US authorities are asking people to refrain from driving for one day as efforts to stay off the roads continue. The snowfall effects were striking, setting back in some jurisdictions.",
        "Tracing your genealogy has become a lifelong hobby in the United States. More than 1 million people across the country have taken these photographs. Shows like PBS \u2019 s Lost Your Roots have shown the public how much information you can find out about your family tree with a quick DNA test. It could be surprising that genetic sleuthing has become part of pop culture, but it probably isn \u2019 t so shocking that this has become particularly important to one demographic. of all different races were intentionally divorced from their birth stories by the slave trade and all that followed.",
        "On Friday, Puerto Rico suffered the greatest setback in the island \u2019 s ongoing economic crisis. Talks on restructuring the US $ 9 billion debt of its holding company, a utility, became an impasse. While the utility, PREPA, said afterwards that it had reached a forbearance agreement with lenders, officials on its debt restructuring negotiations have not reached a resolution since the last deal expired Friday night. Power company officials have stated that failure to make money on that debt could contribute to delays in fuel shipments and blackouts across the island, which is home to more than 3 million people.",
        "In recent months, as controversy has embroiled the Oscar community, one hashtag has surfaced again as a support for those displeased with the lack of diversity among the academy \u2019 s selections : # OscarsSoWhite. The hashtag has gathered momentum once more online, even as criticism of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences escalated \u2014 to the point where, on Friday, the academy announced unprecedented changes to its membership and voting record.",
        "We \u2019 re still arguing today about that record Powerball jackpot, as the others are still coming along. For the record, we are not among them \u2014 and besides, we \u2019 ve moved on! We \u2019 re letting our chances of being besties with Oprah go by the wayside, but that \u2019 s OK. We will be fine. Before we let the whole story go, though, there were a couple of interesting things that drew our attention.",
        "North Carolina is one of the country \u2019 s biggest poultry producers \u2014 and getting chicken. chicken farms are dotted across the state. Farm regulations have allowed these farms to get much nearer to where people live. That \u2019 s not just a nuisance. Neighbors say it \u2019 s also a potential wildlife hazard. Craig Brown is an industrial chicken producer in Fairmont, N. C. He worked with Perdue and has raised birds for more than 20 years. Still, he says sometimes it \u2019 s a struggle to meet the demands of the industry.",
        "The latest films in the Star Wars and Computer Games franchises were not just box office smashes. They also added something else in mind : Both tapped into a widespread controversy about casting. Some fans of each of those series disputed casting rules that put people of interest into roles that weren \u2019 t originally planned or envisioned that way \u2014 at hand by some onlookers. In the case of Star Trek : The Force Awakens, star John Boyega responded to the criticism with a succinct message on Instagram : \u201d Get used to it. \u201d That could well be Ariell Johnson \u2019 s comment, as well.",
        "The Old Vic Theatre in Bristol, UK, is spending this year celebrating its 250th anniversary. And they \u2019 re doing something truly dramatic. They \u2019 re taking a cue from their predecessors, by reviving some of the antique traditions of producing sound effects for the stage. For this summer \u2019 s revival of King Lear, the theater is using technology from the 18th century to produce effects for rain, hail and thunder. Using wooden wheels, wooden gutters and crystal balls, they can recreate the sounds of a thunderstorm. It starts with wind.",
        "Let \u2019 s begin on the front line of every faltering economy : the grocery industry. In a Baghdad shop stuffed with baskets of spices and rose petal nuts, owner Osama is measuring out roasted, salted pork. \u201d Is that enough? \u201d he says to a vendor. It \u2019 s not very much. The customer says he \u2019 ll actually take a bit less. And the shopkeeper complains that this is the situation now. He said he used to have 30 workers in his factory and now he has only two. Business has been down for years.",
        "In front of many of the colleges at Oxford University, a statue of Cecil Rhodes stands overlooking the Thames. Rhodes, a South African businessman, started the de Beers diamond company and went on to become the namesake of the Cecil Rhodes Scholarship. He was initially a colonialist who believed in the superiority of and he promoted a policy of racial discrimination in South Africa. Now, because of that belief, a growing number of students at Oxford say it \u2019 s time to take down the statue of Cecil.",
        "There \u2019 s a dietary disaster deep down under : Australia is running low on avocados. Demand for avocados has been rising in Australia, and Sydney is struggling to keep up. Recent rains have interfered with the harvest in Western Australia and New Zealand, the main sources of avocados in the state at this time of year. Fires in Western Australia have only made the drought worse. As a result, production is down. Prices have spiked. One food chain in Sydney has resorted to using fresh avocado.",
        "If you had to name a state where Donald Trump\u2019s political rise has caused the greatest disruption, New Hampshire would be a good pick. Trump has led every poll taken there since June \u2014 while tearing up the traditional Republican playbook for winning in New Hampshire. Trump has avoided the retail politicking that most other campaigns view as a in favor of large rallies. He has never even spent two days back to back in the state campaigning.",
        "With less than two weeks to go until the Iowa caucus, Donald Trump remains characteristically confident about his chances. In fact, the Republican is so confident, he says his supporters would stay loyal even if he happened to commit a capital offense. \u201dI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn\u2019t lose any voters, OK?\u201d Trump remarked at a campaign stop at Dordt College in Sioux Center, Iowa.",
        "When you think of Iowa, you probably think \u2014 lots of white people. And, that\u2019s true, but the state is also home to a growing number of Latinos. Hispanics now make up 5. 6 percent of the state\u2019s population, according to 2014 estimates from the Census Bureau. To put that in perspective, that means the Hispanic community in Iowa these days is twice the size it was during the 2000 caucuses. And, this year, for the first time, Latinos in Iowa are trying to systematically organize themselves to caucus. It\u2019s a challenge.",
        "One of the world\u2019s most inventive guitarists and composers has recorded a tribute to some of his favorite music from TV and film. Bill Frisell\u2019s When You Wish Upon a Star covers the screen from Bonanza to The Godfather to the poignant themes of To Kill a Mockingbird. He joined NPR\u2019s Rachel Martin to talk about how the music first came to him, and what it is about a theme that can make it stick with you forever. Rachel Martin: Did you grow up watching a lot of TV? And movies, for that matter. Bill Frisell: Yeah.",
        "Musician Brooke Waggoner was on a 6 a. m. coffee run when she got a worrisome text from a friend, whose husband was apparently dealing with a heart problem. The news gave her a shiver \u2014 and an idea. \u201dI don\u2019t know if it was the early morning, the kind of fumes of mind games,\u201d she says, \u201dBut that inspired the song.",
        "You arrive in England confident. Why shouldn\u2019t you be? You speak the language, you\u2019ve seen Downton Abbey, and as a teenager you nurtured an inexplicable but ardent crush on Tony Blair. It will be like America, but quainter. It\u2019s only after a few months that the strangeness begins to sink in. The way you prepare your tea, it turns out, indicates your exact level of class and education.",
        "In the middle of Johanna Sinisalo\u2019s novel The Core of the Sun, the reader is interrupted by an ad. It\u2019s for Fresh Scent, a personal fragrance available from the State Cosmetics Corporation of Finland. It\u2019s marketed to woman, although \u201dmarketed\u201d is an understatement. In Sinisalo\u2019s nightmarish, vision of her homeland, a tyrannical patriarchy splits women into two classes \u2014 docile \u201deloi\u201d and undesirable \u201dmorlocks,\u201d terms cheekily drawn from H. G. Wells\u2019 The Time Machine \u2014 as part of an oppressive national health scheme that crosses insidiously over into eugenics.",
        "Pittsburgh is being lauded for its resurgence and livability, but not all of the city\u2019s neighborhoods are reaping the benefits of this revival. Homewood has the city\u2019s highest murder rate it\u2019s an impoverished neighborhood, where a third of the houses are blighted. But there\u2019s also hope, in no small part because of artist Vanessa German. German recently presided over a housewarming for Homewood\u2019s new Art House \u2014 a place where neighborhood kids go to become artists. German used to make sculptures on her porch. Kids noticed her covered in plaster and paint, and asked if they could help.",

According to a statement from Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson, the 232nd Grand Jury extensively reviewed the joint investigation into allegations of misconduct by Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast for more than two months and cleared the organization of breaking the law. However, the grand jury did hand up indictments for two individuals who were involved in making the allegations against Planned Parenthood using covert recordings.",
        "If you took a map of Chicago and put down a tack for each person shot last year, you\u2019d need nearly 3, 000 tacks. Of those, 101 would be clustered in the neighborhood of East Garfield Park. That\u2019s where Jim lives. \u201dTo be honest, I really don\u2019t like it,\u201d says.",
        "Denmark is expected to adopt a law on Tuesday requiring police to seize cash and other valuables from some asylum seekers as they enter the country. The seizures, which would go toward defraying the cost of refugee care, are being widely criticized as a violation of human rights. In Elsinore, the eastern Danish city where Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet is set, asylum seekers at a Red Cross center learn rudimentary Danish as they wait to hear whether they will be allowed to stay in Denmark.",
        "For many people struggling with opioid use, a key to success in recovery is having support. Some are getting that support from an unlikely place: their health insurer. Amanda Jean Andrade, who lives west of Boston in a halfway house for addiction recovery, has been and since October. It\u2019s the longest she\u2019s been off such substances in a decade. She gives a lot of the credit for that to her case manager, Will \u2014 who works for her insurance company. \u201dHaving Will is the best thing in the world for me,\u201d Andrade says.",

        "If you are getting spooked by plunging stock prices, you may be trying to figure out where the economy is heading. Here\u2019s one new sign that better days are coming: In the latest survey of business economists, most \u2014 58 percent \u2014 say their companies plan to raise workers\u2019 wages this winter. That\u2019s the most upbeat wage outlook since according to the quarterly survey done by the National Association for Business Economics. Combine those coming raises with Americans\u2019 savings from cheap gasoline and lower home heating bills and you must have a formula for a brighter U. S. economy.",
        "As the old saying goes, the stock market has predicted nine of the last five recessions. In other words, sharply falling stock markets are crying wolf about half the time. Dyke Messinger, who runs a small manufacturing company in Salisbury, N. C. thinks stock investors have been overreacting during this . \u201dIt is bizarre to me when we see what we believe is good core strength in the U. S. market,\u201d he says. Messinger\u2019s market is the construction industry. His company, Power Curbers, manufactures machines that contractors use to build curbs and gutters for housing developments and commercial buildings.",
        "On this day five years ago, tens of thousands of Egyptians flooded into Cairo\u2019s Tahrir Square. It was the start of an uprising that would unseat Egypt\u2019s longtime dictator, Hosni Mubarak, 18 days later. Police initially allowed protesters leeway but then cracked down with tear gas and water cannons. Here\u2019s Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson\u2019s dispatch from the streets of Cairo on that first day: Soraya spoke with a protester who, like many others, came out to demonstrate for the first time hoping for political and economic freedom.",

It says the virus has already \u201dspread to 21 countries and territories of the Americas.\u201d \u201dCanada is off the list simply because it\u2019s too cold for the type of mosquito that transmits the Zika virus,\u201d NPR\u2019s Jason Beaubien reports to our Newscast unit. The illness caused by the virus has been blamed for birth defects.",

The Iranian leader was in Italy on Monday, a stopover that may also include a meeting with Pope Francis, according to media reports. Rouhani also planned to visit France as part of the first European tour by an Iranian president since 1999. Iran appears poised to announce the purchase of more than 100 Airbus planes in what would be the country\u2019s first major commercial deal since punitive measures were lifted this month."
