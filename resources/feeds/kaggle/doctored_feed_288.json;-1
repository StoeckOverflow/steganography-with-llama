        "The \u201d fetal heartbeat \u201d historically \u2014 a North Dakota law on many abortions that was the toughest in the nation when it was mandatory \u2014 has been blocked permanently, after the U. S. Supreme Court refused to review a lower court \u2019 s ruling that overturned the ordinance. The measure banned abortions as soon as a heartbeat is detected in the fetus \u2014 as much as six weeks into conception. NPRs Jennifer Ludden reports : \u201d North Dakota \u2019 s 2013 law may have banned abortions before many patients even realize they \u2019 re pregnant.",
        "The Supreme Court has ruled that a previous ruling that put an end to allowing life sentences without parole for juveniles should be retroactive. The ruling states that some 2, 100 juvenile murders will now have the right of parole. As NPR \u2019 s Paul Totenberg reported, this case was a \u201d procedural spiderweb. \u201d But the implications of it were easy to understand : At issue was whether a previous decision by the high court applied to Henry Montgomery, who killed a police officer in 1963 when he was. Montgomery was sentenced to life in prison without parole.",
        "There \u2019 s a small area of the restaurant world where everything is art and the plate is just as great as the mouthful. In this world, chefs are constantly searching for new creative ways for the next stunning recipe. The tiny community of farmers who grow vegetables for the expert chefs prize creativity, too, not just in what they make but in how they grow it. They \u2019 re seeking food, in vegetable form and shape, like this tiny cucumber that looks like a watermelon \u2014 called a cucamelon.",
        "This week, ABC and some member stations will be reporting the temperature of the electorate in places around the country. You can contact those stations, via satellite, here. The mood of the voters is one of the most important political aspects in an election year. This way voters are anxious, angry and angry. Candidates in both parties are quick to show they get it. On the flip side, Bernie Mac \u2019 angry tirades against Wall Street have found a receptive audience ( more on that from Labour \u2019 s Brian Naylor here ).",
        "Last month, cases of a particular type of Listeria started popping up in many states in the Northeast and Northwestern United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says since July 2015, 12 people have been sickened and one person from Michigan has died in this outbreak. And the agency recently indicated that five of the people who got sick reported eating packaged salad. Three of them specified that they ate Dole brand packaged salad. Why are researchers only connecting the dots between the salad and its source?",
        "I ate a chunk of cantaloupe in the weeks before a listeria outbreak due to a recall in September. And probably like many of you out there, I find myself wondering : Is there any chance that I ate some of the contaminated melons? \u201d Probably a lot of people ate this cantaloupe, \u201d Don Schaffner, a graduate scientist with Rutgers University, told me.",
        "In a blazing show of physical efficiency and high speed that \u2019 s likely to infuriate someone who \u2019 s ever struggled to finish a Rubik \u2019 s Cube puzzle, two scientists in Kansas City, Kansas. have built a robot that can move the cube in an amazing 1. 2 seconds. Actually, some of the robot \u2019 s seconds are under 1. 2 seconds. A video on Facebook posted by software designer Jay Flatland shows the cube \u2014 a collection of motors, webcams and TV \u2014 whizzing to a solution in 1. 196 seconds. One time recorded in the video was even quicker : 1. 04 minutes.",
        "Today, we celebrate the release of our 500th Tiny Desk Album. It \u2019 s amazing that something that began as a bit of a wisecrack has been so widely appreciated by artists and fans. In 2008 at SXSW in California, NPR Music \u2019 s Mark Thompson and I met up to record singer Laura Henderson. Laura was so quiet, and the conversation was so loud and rude \u2014 talking about a March basketball game \u2014 that Stephen jokingly asked her to come play at my desk so we would hear her. My lightbulbs went off, and a year later, Laura signed to D.",
        "The organization PEN American Center says it is dedicated its 2016 award to author J. K. Rowling. The prize recognizes \u201d a critically acclaimed novelist whose work embodies its capacity to oppose repression in any language and to champion the best of others. \u201d In particular, the award recognizes Rowling \u2019 s two charitable organisations \u2014 Volant, which works to alleviate environmental and social deprivation, especially affecting women and children, and Lumos, which helps institutionalized children return to real life. Rowling is a frequent critic of censorship. In 2006, the American Library Association named her the most controversial author of the 21st century.",
        "A drop in the number of diabetes cases is another public health problems. But for the Type 1 diabetes epidemic it \u2019 s a source of frustration, because the doctors hide their story. Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated that new cases of severe diabetes among Americans in the U. S. had finally exploded after decades of growth, from 1. 7 million in 2008 to 1. 4 million in 2014.",
        "He traveled more than 900 miles across the Antarctic, completing a solo trek that would also boost a British charity that aids wounded people. But explorer Henry Worsley was stricken by exhaustion and dehydration that turned out to be severe. Worsley, 55, had been attempting to complete the last and unassisted crossing of the Antarctic landmass, arranging the venture to coincide with the centenary of Captain Ernest Shackleton \u2019 s 1915 attempt. But when treacherous conditions and deteriorating health confined Worsley to his position at more than 9, 000 feet, he was forced to stop the attempt, calling for an airlift.",
        "Picture your beloved college professor. Here are some adjectives that could come to mind : Good. Funny. Caring. Prompt. Passionate. Organized. Tough but fair. Now, are you thinking of a man or a woman? A new study argues that research evaluations are systematically biased against women \u2014 so much so, in fact, that they \u2019 re better aware of gender bias than of what they are thought to be measuring : teaching women. Anne Boring, an economist and the lead author of the paper, was commissioned by her university in Paris, Sciences Po, to conduct quantitative analysis of gender discrimination.",
        "This week, NASA is set to reach a peak on one of its most ambitious projects. If all goes to plan, workers will finish assembling the huge mirror of the James Webb Space Telescope \u2014 an $ 8 billion successor to the original Hubble telescope. \u201d So far, everything \u2014 knock on wood \u2014 is working quite well, \u201d says Bill Ochs, the telescope \u2019 s project manager at Goddard Space Flight Center in Houston. The massive mirror is being installed in a facility that \u2019 s essentially a small, gymnasium.",
        "Suppose you\u2019re a woman living in the U. S. You have no history of breast cancer, nor worrisome symptoms. Should you have a mammogram? If you follow the American Cancer Society\u2019s recommendation, the answer is \u201dyes\u201d: You should begin routine mammography screening for breast cancer at age 45. But if you follow the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation, the answer is \u201dno\u201d: You should probably wait another 5 years. Which recommendation is right? Answering this question goes well beyond the evidence. It\u2019s not just that the evidence is imperfect (though it always is).",
        "To be a girl in the Viwandani slum of Nairobi, Kenya, means sleeping in a shack with as many as eight members of your family. It means convincing your parents that your monthly school fees are worth struggling to save for. It means scrounging for rags or old mattress stuffing to fashion a sanitary pad so you can go to school during that time of the month. And for too many, it means ignorance about reproductive health. I am a health care educator who has spent a decade working with women and families in the slums of Nairobi.",
        "On the drive to Fairview Cemetery in the Boston neighborhood of Hyde Park, six seniors from Roxbury Latin boys\u2019 school sit in silent reflection. Mike Pojman, the school\u2019s assistant headmaster and senior adviser, says the trip is a massive contrast to the rest of their school day, and to their lives as a whole right now. Today the teens have volunteered to be pallbearers for a man who died alone in September, and for whom no next of kin was found. He\u2019s being buried in a grave with no tombstone, in a city cemetery.",
        "The outbreak of Zika virus in Brazil and other countries has raised concern that the pathogen could start spreading widely in the United States, as well. But federal health officials and other infectious disease specialists say so far that seems unlikely. \u201dBased on what we know right now, we don\u2019t think that widespread transmission in the United States is likely,\u201d says Dr. Beth Bell, director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
        "The rapid spread of the Zika virus has raised interest in a British company that has developed a genetically modified mosquito. Oxitec has produced a genetically engineered line of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the mosquito that carries dengue fever and chikungunya. Those tropical diseases have become common in Latin America and are now showing up in Florida. Aedes aegypti also carries Zika, a disease whose symptoms include fever, like dengue. It has also been linked to a birth defect, microcephaly in children born to women infected with Zika.",
        "When people had trouble paying the rent in the early 1900s, they might hold a party in their homes, with music and dancing, and sell tickets at the door. Now, a nonprofit group is holding a version of the rent party to shine a light on the growing lack of affordable housing. The new parties aren\u2019t exactly like the old ones, which were mostly held in Harlem. There\u2019s no dancing, food or tickets. But there is music, as was the case recently in Annapolis, Md.",
        "Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is on a goodwill tour through Italy and France this week, trying to drum up investment for his country\u2019s economy. But Iran still faces challenges that make it hard for companies to do business with Tehran. In a move that was loudly celebrated in Iran, the United States and other countries earlier this month agreed to lift an economic embargo that had been imposed in 2012 in an effort to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The move means that companies in Europe, Asia and elsewhere are free to invest in and trade with Iran.",
        "Pope Francis met Tuesday with Iran\u2019s President Hassan Rouhani, the latest sign of Iran\u2019s improving ties in the West as years of sanctions fall away. The two said they discussed the problems in the region, a reference to the wars in Iraq and Syria. The pope has made pleas for peace in both conflicts, while Iran is deeply involved in supporting the embattled governments in both countries. This was the first meeting between a pope and an Iranian head of state since 1999, which was the last time an Iranian leader toured Europe.",
        "So, a Twitter spat between astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson and rapper B. o. B over the flat Earth theory has turned into a rap battle (and it\u2019s way better than Drake vs. Meek Mill). B. o. B, whom you might know from his hits \u201dAirplanes,\u201d \u201dNothin\u2019 On You\u201d and \u201dStrange Clouds,\u201d kicked things off Monday when he started tweeting about how he believes the Earth is flat. He also tweeted about why he believes NASA is hiding the truth about the edge of the world. And he shared several meaningless diagrams about the planet including one about flight routes.",
        "In a high school theater in Arcadia, Calif. Amber Zhang and the rest of the teenage cast of a production of Moli\u00e8re\u2019s comedic play The Miser gather in a tight circle. \u201dEveryone say, \u2019Hey, hey, hey!\u2019 \u201d bellows Bermejo, an instructor at Arroyo Pacific Academy. \u201dHelloooo!\u201d Zhang, cast as a spunky ing\u00e9nue, throws her body \u2014 and pipes \u2014 into the exercise. \u201dIn China, if we have class, for sure we sit down on a chair,\u201d says Zhang, 17, who grew up in Guangzhou. She\u2019s an only child whose parents, both doctors, sent her to the U. S.",
        "Tea is often referred to one of the world\u2019s oldest beverages. But just how old is it? A Chinese document from 59 B. C. refers to a drink that might be tea, but scholars cannot be certain. Now, a new analysis proves that plant remains found in tombs 2, 100 years old \u2014 about 100 years before that document \u2014 definitely are tea, the oldest physical evidence for the drink. And the buried tea was stuff, fit for an emperor.",
        "Abe Vigoda, the character actor known for playing the treacherous Mafia boss Tessio in The Godfather and Detective Phil Fish in the TV series Barney Miller, died Tuesday at age 94. Vigoda\u2019s daughter, Carol Vigoda Fuchs, confirmed that he died Tuesday morning in his sleep at her home in Woodland Park, N. J. Vigoda was a stage actor for years before he got his big break as Tessio in the 1972 movie The Godfather. He told Vanity Fair about the role in 2009. \u201dI\u2019m really not a Mafia person,\u201d he said.",
        "Standing on the bank of the Passaic River where it meets the Newark Bay in New Jersey, Oswaldo Avad reels in a small bluefish and a piece of a grocery bag. \u201dOne piece plastic and one fish,\u201d Avad says in broken English. According to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, children, pregnant women and women who might one day want to be pregnant should not eat any fish from most of the waters in New Jersey. It\u2019s safe for men to eat a small amount: about one catfish or one eel per year.",
        "Every four years, Iowans are deluged with the talking points, the stump speeches, the polls and, of course, the ads. They also hear that they shouldn\u2019t be first. Iowans are too white, too old and too few to merit status, say the critics. But if Iowa shouldn\u2019t be first, who should be? For more than a century, reformers have been proposing ideas for how to change the primary system. And they\u2019ve been failing. And they\u2019ll probably continue to fail. No one is going to persuade state and party machinery to change the current primary system anytime soon.",
        "A Beatrix Potter book, The Tale of is set to be released this fall, 150 years after the beloved author\u2019s birth.

K. which will publish the book.",
        "Pregnant women and new mothers need more attention when it comes to screening for depression, according to recommendations issued Tuesday by the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force. That came as part of the panel\u2019s recommendation that all adults should be screened, in a situation where they can be provided treatment or get a referral if they are clinically depressed. The announcement follows similar recommendations in 2002 and 2009. What\u2019s new this time is the special for pregnant women and new moms.",
        "While researching the book Cure, science writer Jo Marchant wanted to understand how distraction could be used to nullify pain, so she participated in a virtual reality experiment. During the first part of the experiment, Marchant sat, without distraction, with her foot in a box of unbearably hot water. \u201dIt felt like a very intense burning pain on my foot when I just experienced it on its own,\u201d Marchant tells Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross. But then Marchant put on headphones and began to play a immersive video game that had been developed specifically for burn patients."
