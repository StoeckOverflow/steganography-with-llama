        "Medical researchers don \u2019 t usually attract academic attention. They perform their regular duties evaluating submissions and producing articles that, on good advice, influence practice and science. But last Wednesday, the meeting of the leading medical societies around the world announced a proposal that could bring medical science journals. They said that researchers would have to publicly share the evidence gathered in their clinical investigations as a condition of publishing the papers in the journals. This idea is now out for private comment.",
        "As a master of the space metaphor, the great actor Vladimir Nabokov used food to fine effect in his films. There was, for instance, that one word he used to capture the light, tinge and luster of his watery green eyes \u2014 \u201d oysterous. \u201d And that icky dream in Lolita, of motel floors burnished with the \u201d glaze of neon, \u201d that somehow made those hotel floors complicit in the squalor of pedophilia. But when it came to sex, he really couldn \u2019 t be bothered.",
        "The state of New Jersey has been trying to make jurors better assess the quality of eyewitness testimony, but a recent investigation suggests that the effort may be having unintended consequences. That \u2019 s because a new set of instructions read to jurors by a citizen seems to make them ignorant of all eyewitness testimony \u2014 even testimony that should be considered reasonably reasonable. Back in 2012, New Jersey \u2019 s Supreme Court did another groundbreaking. It said that in trials that involve eyewitness testimony, courts must give jurors a revised set of instructions.",
        "Gary Snyder has holes in his garden wall. That \u2019 s not normally the kind of hole you \u2019 d find in a British mansion in a market town like Chipping Norton, 75 miles northeast of London. But the holes are there for a purpose : hedgehogs. Snyder \u2019 s backyard is now one small rest stop on what conservationists hope will be a network of hedgehog superhighways crisscrossing Europe. Snyder says at night he didn \u2019 t even know he had hedgehogs going through \u2014 they \u2019 re nocturnal, hibernating during the winter months. But last night he was in bed with his family.",
        "If you \u2019 ve been digging out of snowbanks already, as many people in the world have been after a blizzard, blame the oceans. Police have been doing some forensic work to find out what set this megastorm in motion. And they believe they \u2019 ve found a trail that agrees with the weather pattern called El Ni\u00f1o. El Ni\u00f1o originated in the tropical Pacific. Last few years, the ocean there got unusually warm. This island is one of the biggest El Ni\u00f1os ever. Heat and debris from it have been swept up into the tropical air stream and carried back.",
        "As researchers have attempted to understand how poverty and its implications influence children \u2019 s intellectual development, they \u2019 ve begun untangling how that can lead to increased behavior modification and learning difficulties for disadvantaged individuals. Rather than trying to solve those problems, NYU child development specialists Adriana Weisleder and Alan Mendelsohn decided to head them off. They say they \u2019 ve found a way : Working with kids when they bring babies and young children to the pediatrician. They \u2019 ve been able to solve key obstacles to attention like hyperactivity and difficulty getting attention, according to research published Wednesday in the magazine Pediatrics.",
        "The City of Ottawa, Mo. and the Justice Department have released a draft of the consent decree that they have negotiated. The draft agreement creates resources for training police officers on issues like when they should join force and how they can \u201d reorient Ferguson \u2019 s policies toward and avoiding corruption. \u201d The agreement also creates cameras and an overhaul of the police court system. Importantly, as with other changes in the past, it requires the selection and appointment of an independent judge.",
        "marriage or civil unions are legal throughout Western Europe, like many traditionally socialist countries. The last holdout is Monaco, where the Senate is about to take up a motion on Thursday that would legalize civil unions \u2014 though it would not authorize gay marriage. Tens of thousands of Italians took to the polls last weekend in some 100 places demanding legalization of civil unions, including those of gay and bisexual couples. \u201d Italy, it \u2019 s going to wake up, \u201d they shouted.",
        "In a sign the military occupation of a federal wildlife refuge may be slowed down, the FBI announced late Wednesday that eight officers had left the compound. Three were released and three detained. The FBI said in a report : \u201d All [ three ] were in contact with the enemy, and each chose to turn himself into [ FBI ] agents at a checkpoint outside the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. The missions were without incident. \u201d Each officer faces one federal felony count of conspiracy to impede members of the United States from discharging their official duties through the use of force, intimidation, or threats.",

        "Ray \u2019 s Sporting Goods in Dallas \u2019 Oak Creek is a neighborhood firearm dreamland. It \u2019 s stocked with the finest pistols, shotguns and rifles. Jim Payne, the store \u2019 s founder, says he has sold to a lot more women recently. \u201d A lot of married ladies with their wives, some without, but they \u2019 ve decided that their son \u2019 s not home, they need to be able to do something and they need a different gun than what their husband had, \u201d Payne says.

        "As the Islamic Church uses social networks and the Internet to recruit Muslims, a group of American Jewish millennials are also using the same way to clear up misconceptions. Tired of being called a terrorist, Ranny Badreddine, a youth from Evansville, Ind. joined other Islamic teens to create Game Changers, an initiative that uses the cyberspace to clear misconceptions about Islam. \u201d Kids have to be careful about... going outside and being told that someone is going to beat them up because they \u2019 re Muslim, \u201d Badreddine says.",

        "Ever since a tense, armed standoff near Cliven Bundy\u2019s Nevada ranch in 2014, a vast and sensitive piece of federal public land adjacent to the Grand Canyon has gone unmanaged and unpatrolled. It\u2019s safe to travel into the area called Gold Butte so long as you\u2019re not in a federal vehicle, according to Jaina Moan of Friends of Gold Butte, which wants to see the area federally protected. The last time there was any known federal presence was last summer, when scientists under contract with the Bureau of Land Management were camped here, gathering field research.",
        "Where a mainstream fashion magazine might do a special \u201dblack issue,\u201d like Italian Vogue back in 2008, or a black lifestyle magazine might run a queer feature, the perspective of queer black folks tends to occupy occasional outskirts in fashion and lifestyle glossies, never the mainstay. The Tenth, a new print magazine by and for queer black men, now on its third issue, wants to help change that, at least from the POV of its founders. Its name is inspired by two sources: W. E. B.",
        "For women who are pregnant, or hope to be, the news about the Zika virus can be terrifying. The pathogen is being linked to a significant increase in Brazil of a rare birth defect called microcephaly. The virus has already spread to 22 countries in the Americas. That\u2019s led four countries, Ecuador, El Salvador, Jamaica and Colombia, to recommend that women delay their pregnancies. It\u2019s a strategy that is being criticized by some.",

        "No country is free of public corruption, a scourge that has effects on the lives of billions of people. But in 2015, more countries saw drops in corruption than those that saw gains, according to the new Corruption Perceptions Index. The United States lost three points from its 2014 score, but the country kept its No. 16 ranking, tied with Austria and just ahead of Hong Kong. The top spot went to Denmark, followed by Finland.

        "On a typical day at the Capitoline Museum in Rome, a visitor might expect to see classical nude statues like this: But this was the scene before Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and visiting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani held a news conference this week at the museum: Out of apparent concern about offending Rouhani, white wooden boxes covered up many of the collection\u2019s ancient nudes.

        "A computer has bested humanity at one of the most complex strategy games ever devised. Researchers at Google have developed a program that can excel at the game of \u201dgo,\u201d which originated in China and is considered a tougher problem for a machine than other strategy games such as chess. The program has defeated the European champion of the game. Now its developers say the same technology may be used to conquer problems in everything from medicine to climate modelling.

They\u2019re not a minute too soon: Roughly a third of the wall\u2019s 12, 000 miles has crumbled to dust, and saving what\u2019s left of it may be the world\u2019s greatest challenge in cultural preservation.

        "Clay Hull has a stubborn sense of justice. After an improvised explosive device blast in Iraq ended his time in the military, he fought the Army and the Department of Veterans Affairs over the amount of compensation they awarded him for his injuries. \u201dIf I\u2019m in the wrong, I\u2019ll admit it.

        "On Sunday, Jan. 17, globalFEST, one of America\u2019s premiere showcases of musical talent from around the world, once again took over the three stages at Manhattan\u2019s Webster Hall. The festival has few American rivals in the way it simultaneously expands and condenses musical perspectives. The performances here move naturally between those that are heady and and those that are rhythmically sumptuous and . Sometimes the shift from, say, Eastern European folk theater to party music to Parisian to Bhangra drums creates deep, wonderful contexts about the world we live in at others, it is jarring.",

        "A principle of U. S. politics, that voters prefer candidates with strong faith beliefs, has been called into question in the 2016 presidential campaign. Recent opinion surveys suggest that voters don\u2019t see either Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders as very religious, but that perception does not seem to be damaging their political prospects. Two trends are evident from new surveys by the Pew Research Center and the Public Religion Research Institute: Trump scores lowest of the candidates on religiosity, Just 30 percent of U. S.",
        "If Donald Trump keeps his promise not to appear at Thursday night\u2019s Fox News debate, it will be the first time in recent history that a top candidate, let alone the will skip such a event so close to Election Day. But, if anyone can pull off such a stunt and still come out on top, it\u2019s probably Trump. He\u2019s been breaking all the usual political rules this cycle. \u201dIt\u2019s totally unprecedented.

        "Donald Trump said this week if he went out on Fifth Avenue in New York and shot someone, he probably wouldn\u2019t lose any votes. He chose a pretty big someone \u2014 Fox News (whose offices are one block over from Fifth). Tune in to Thursday night\u2019s Republican debate on Fox (9 p. m.
