        "Ancient Babylonian astronomers recorded the motion of Jupiter using a technique that historians had thought was invented some 1, 400 years ago, in Europe. That \u2019 s according to a review published Thursday in the magazine Science by Mathieu Ossendrijver of Humboldt College in Berlin. He has a Ph. D. in astrophysics, but instead of studying the stars, Ossendrijver spent his days poring over crumbling clay bricks, covered with the tiny scrawls of Babylonian astronomy. The Babylonians lived before the birth of Islam in what is now Iraq.",
        "Once again this week, an investigation into Planned Parenthood \u2019 s alleged sale of fetal body came up empty. A grand jury in Harris County, Texas, voted to indict in a new investigation of Planned Parenthood. But it didn \u2019 t indict the reproductive rights organization. In an unexpected way, the grand jury arrested two activists from the Association for Medical Progress. That is the organization that famously last month released videos that it showed depicted Planned Parenthood illegally continuing to sell fetal body tissues. The videos served as a key rallying point for Americans opposed to abortion.",
        "For the past six years, the Texas Government has done everything in its power to defund Planned Parenthood. But it \u2019 s not so easy to target that group without hurting baby planning clinics across the state generally. Of the 82 clinics that have closed, only a third were Planned Parenthood. Midland Community Healthcare Education Clinic in West Hollywood is open, and every year it \u2019 s three lines close as women file in for exams. The clinic \u2019 s 15 examination lines go full throttle all night but can \u2019 t come close to overwhelming demand. The numbers are good.",
        "A wave of atrocities in Burundi last December resulted in the deaths of scores of children. Now Amnesty International said satellite images and video footage indicate that thousands of people killed by genocide were buried in mass cemeteries. \u201d These images suggest a desperate effort by the authorities to clear up the extent of the killings by their military forces, \u201d Muthoni Wanyeki, Amnesty International \u2019 s Regional Director for West Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes, said, referring to an an Amnesty statement.",
        "Brittany Howard, the lead singer, bassist and guitarist with Alabama Shakes, said she still remembers the day she decided to start a band. She was 11 or 12 and attending a concert in her small gym put on by some musicians ( including future Alabama Shakes guitarist Heath Fogg ). \u201d said about 45, 50 kids showed up that year, and we watched them play and... it was like having a double life. It was like watching a James Bond film. I didn \u2019 t know these guys had these talents, \u201d Howard tells Fresh Air \u2019 s Scott Gross.",
        "A human transmission of Zika virus vaccine would begin as early as this day, U. S. health officials told reporters online. But the officials cautioned that it could be dangerous before the vaccine is available for medical use. The news varies as the Zika virus continues to spread through the Americas. Still, a vaccine outbreak is seen as likely in the U. S. \u201d There \u2019 s still a threat we don \u2019 t know, so we have to be very careful about making any absolute predictions, \u201d says Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.",
        "In her first international address on the Zika outbreak, the Head of the World Health Organization, Dr. Margaret Chan, said the virus has grown from being \u201d a mild threat to death of alarming proportions. \u201d Chan spent Thursday in Geneva.",
        "Flip through the pages of La Comida Latina and you may quickly fall under its spell. The pages of this cookbook beckon with vivid watercolor illustrations and recipes drawn in the kind of delicate white lettering that make us mourn penmanship as a lost art. The end product combines the charm of a chef \u2019 s book, the promise of a tasty food and the intimacy of a journal.",
        "Some octopuses intimidate their neighbors by turning black, standing straight and looming over them threateningly, like an owl. That \u2019 s according to a study published Thursday that helps suggest that octopuses aren \u2019 t loners, contrary to what scientists originally thought some of the invertebrates have an exciting home life. The study, in the book Current Biology, focuses on one species, identified as Octopus tetricus \u2014 the gloomy octopus \u2014 which gathers to munch on tasty scallops in the shallows of Jervis Bay, Australia.",
        "You know it in your soul. You might not keep your New Year \u2019 s resolutions. Your bad intentions might take on hard times. The universe might twist. You have no crystal ball. Emily also noted it \u2014 the inscrutability of what \u2019 s to come.",
        "Tickets to the most popular events and other live events are relatively hard to find because of poor practices by vendors who sometimes use computer hardware called bots to grab them up, according to a report released by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. In some cases, tickets to live events come out within minutes, only to stop right away at new markups on sites such as StubHub, according to the law, which calls for major improvements to the ticketing process. \u201d The problem is not always that demand for prime tickets exceeds supply, except for the most events.",
        "The Eagle Huntress, a drama film set in Kazakhstan directed by Otto Young and starring teenager Aisholpan Nurgaiv, opens Sunday at Sundance Film Festival in Park Valley, Utah. With its focus on a charismatic girl who has accomplished something other females have not in 2, 000 years \u2014 she hunts on horseback with the head of a golden eagle \u2014 the film has earned standing ovations.

        "In families where biological parents are of different origins and ethnicities, daughters are more likely to as \u201d multiracial \u201d than husbands, according to a new article in the February issue of the National Sociological Review. This is especially true in families with one black parent and one white parent. \u201d It would appear that, for biracial women, looking racially superior is tied to racial differences surrounding femininity and beauty, \u201d said Lauren Davenport, associate professor at Stanford University and author of the study.",
        "Just 1 percent of doctors are linked to nearly of all paid malpractice claims, an analysis by researchers at Stanford finds. And the physicians who account for an outsize share of the claims have a set of distinctive characteristics. The researchers said that the physicians were disproportionately male (82 percent) and were older, rather than younger. More than half the claims were by doctors in four areas: internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, general surgery and general medicine. But the biggest predictor of all for doctors was whether they\u2019d had a prior claim.",
        "Note: NPR\u2019s First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. KING excels at setting a mood. The group\u2019s music conjures an dreamy, Utopian vibe, rather than a mad dash to assemble a who\u2019 of writers and producers. From the KING\u2019s instant fan base embraced that approach, and that\u2019s where the demand for We Are KING took hold.

        "Since 1972, Iowa has held the first presidential nominating contests in the country. Over the years, the Iowa caucuses have grown in size, scope and importance, sometimes launching underdogs to the presidency or upsetting established political juggernauts. It\u2019s easy to accept Iowa\u2019s role in presidential elections for what it is. But in some ways, Iowa should be questioned. The caucus state is whiter and more rural than the rest of the country it doesn\u2019t really represent America in some fundamental ways. Knowing that, why is Iowa first? And is that fair?",
        "This year, just in time for the New Hampshire primary, NPR\u2019s political team has a gift for you: everything you need to know about the caucuses and this election season in one handy PDF.

        "Recent government sanctions against predatory colleges that preyed on veterans by using inflated job promises have opened the window on the wider challenges of helping veterans transition from service to higher education. This week, the Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against DeVry University claiming the deceived students with claims that its graduates make more money and that 90 percent of its graduates seeking work found jobs in their field within six months of graduation. In a statement DeVry vowed to \u201dvigorously contest\u201d the suit it calls baseless.",

        "Macklemore knows what you think of him. The Seattle rapper born Ben Haggerty told me that he spent the first few days following the release of his new song, \u201dWhite Privilege II,\u201d reading the thinkpieces that greeted \u2014 or bemoaned \u2014 its arrival. And then he had to take a break, take Twitter off his phone.",
        "So. Macklemore. I suppose we have to talk about Macklemore. By now you\u2019ve heard \u2014 or heard about \u2014 the white Seattle rapper\u2019s song \u201dWhite Privilege II,\u201d about his tricky relationship with and black protest movements.

        "Schizophrenia might be linked to a gene that tells the immune system to destroy too many connections in the brain, according to the results from a massive research effort. Scientists at Harvard University and the Broad Institute studied the genomes of 64, 785 people around the world and found that those with the debilitating psychiatric disease were much more likely to possess mutations of a common gene, according to the findings published this Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
        "Given the recent expression of anger about the lack of racial diversity in American cinema, it\u2019s nice to be able to tell you about Jay Dockendorf\u2019s very fine indie feature Naz Maalik, in which the title characters are teenage boys who also happen to be devout Muslims who also happen to be gay. That\u2019s three outsider perspectives, which is a lot even for an indie. But the point is not representation for its own sake. The triple layer of alienation from mainstream culture makes for an excitingly fresh slant.",
        "When Elizabeth Estes\u2019s dog, Ollie, started coughing last year, she didn\u2019t think he was seriously ill at first. But then the Jack mix got much worse. \u201dAll of a sudden, he couldn\u2019t breathe and he was coughing. It was so brutal,\u201d says Estes, who lives in Chicago. \u201dThe dog couldn\u2019t breathe. I mean, could not breathe \u2014 just kept coughing and coughing and coughing and gasping for air.\u201d Ollie, it turned out, had caught a strain of dog flu that\u2019s relatively new to the U.

        "Consider these facts, culled from writings here: And then, there\u2019s this tidbit, courtesy of Mark G. Thomas and his friends at University College London: It can be demonstrated that 5, 000 years ago everybody alive was either the common ancestor of everyone alive today, or the common ancestor of no one. Thomas captures the startling upshot of this fact: \u201dAt this point in history we all share exactly the same set of ancestors.\u201d What can we learn from this? This is a question I hope to explore with you in coming months. A couple of things seem reasonably clear.",
        "Every year, millions of kids and teenagers die around the world, often from preventable and treatable conditions. It is a troubling statistic. But if you look beneath the surface numbers, you\u2019ll find signs of hope, says Theo Vos, a professor of global health at the University of Washington in Seattle. Although progress is slow in some countries, he says, the data show rapid improvements in many others. \u201dI always fight with my public health colleagues because I have found they are eternal pessimists,\u201d Vos says. \u201dThey always like to talk about public health problems.",
        "In 1928, Alexander Fleming, a British bacteriologist, escaped the London smog to take a family vacation in Suffolk. When he got back to his lab, he discovered he had forgotten to sterilize his petri dishes. They were covered with bacteria. A few even had mold. As he was cleaning up, Fleming noticed that there was a ring around the mold colonies. He had just discovered penicillin, the makings of an antibiotic that would go on to save millions of lives. This is one of the most famous examples of serendipity in science \u2014 and we\u2019re looking for modern examples.",
        "The Obama administration is proposing a new rule to address unequal pay practices by requiring companies with more than 100 employees to submit salary data by race, gender and ethnicity. The announcement comes seven years after President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act \u2014 his first piece of legislation as president \u2014 which makes it easier for women to challenge discriminatory pay in court. But a stubborn, substantial pay gap between men and women persists, and it affects black and Latina women the most, Obama said Friday as he introduced the proposal."
