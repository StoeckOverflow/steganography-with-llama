        "Pop Culture Happy Hour worked this week juggling a couple of details. For one, a gigantic blizzard had just deposited roughly two inches of snow on the D. C. side, making transportation virtually impossible and, it turns out, stranding Bob Weldon in a Virginia cabin for much of the week. Getting the tapes together would be no easy task. Then there \u2019 s the matter of a long backlog we \u2019 d had lying around, in the form of two Linda Lee interviews \u2014 one morning with Fred Armisen at our live radio show, and one a few days later at D.",
        "Farm workers in two of the nation \u2019 s most important agricultural counties joined other food sector activists on Wednesday, demanding increased wages with a new Bill of Rights. The thrust of the initiative, which is aimed at workers in Fresno and Santa Barbara Valley in California, is to establish a \u201d community of law \u201d in the fields, critics say. \u201d There are rampant violations of agricultural workers rights in Tennessee, \u201d says Bruce Goldstein, executive director of Farmworker Justice, a national advocacy group promoting the effort.",
        "Defense Secretary Ash Carter says he \u2019 s hoping this year to force the Islamic State out of the two largest and most important towns in its caliphate, Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in Iraq. In an interview with NPR Morning Show host Steve Inskeep, Carter offered a broad critique of U. S. military involvement, saying the U. S. was pressing down in Afghanistan, while looking to kick up the tempo in Syria and Iraq. \u201d In Syria and Iraq, we \u2019 re eager to do more because we need to accelerate the spread of ISIL, \u201d Carter said in reference to the Islamic State.",
        "Andy Goodling meets his boyfriend, Bryan, at home in Pennsylvania. Six years ago, they started dating \u2014 but for years, they kept their love hidden. \u201d Bryan was my closest friend, but we were both very much in the middle, \u201d Goodling tells his father, Andrew, on a recent visit with StoryCorps. \u201d You know, we knew who we were. We just didn \u2019 t want to really say it. \u201d Indoors, at Goodling \u2019 s house, they were boyfriends.",
        "I \u2019 m comfortable to talk about anything, Bob Woodruff replied. I \u2019 m lucky to be alive. In October 2006, Woodruff stood on the precipice of stardom as the new correspondent with Elizabeth Vargas, of CBS \u2019 s World News Corporation, the heir in many ways to the legendary globetrotting anchor Jack Jennings, who had died of cancer the previous summer. Woodruff had given viewers stories from the \u201d hermit kingdom \u201d of North Korea and from war zones including the Taliban, Afghanistan and Iraq. In that first month as it made headlines for him to venture once more to Iraq.",
        "Nine days ago, the only way into Tikrit was to pass along dirt roads recently cleared of ISIS activity. You also had to avoid celebratory crowds as Iraqi security forces and their allies wildly celebrated their victory over the extremist group. The city, about 100 miles north of Baghdad, was deserted at the time. After weeks of ISIS occupation followed by intense fighting, houses were destroyed, public buildings were empty and there was no electricity or water.",
        "In the winter of 1987, music producer Todd Lockwood was on the lookout for a promising new project to benefit his label. Lockwood owned the Red Crow recording studios in Burlington, Vt. \u2014 and he didn \u2019 t have to look much to find his bold sound. That idea? Get Mike Sanders \u2014 then the longtime mayor of Burlington \u2014 into the studio to play a few of his favorite songs. \u201d We had this great mayor, a guy who was really on a mission with everything he did, \u201d Lockwood said. \u201d He was charismatic and had a powerful public opinion.",
        "Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump led narrowly just two hours before the Iowa caucuses in the final Des Moines poll, setting the \u201d gold standard \u201d of conservative polling. But Clinton \u2019 s win over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is within the margin of error. Trump trailed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz by 5 points, but pollster Dr. Ann Selzer noted that if evangelicals turn out in similar percentages to years past, Trump \u2019 s lead shrinks to 1, yet he still leads. What \u2019 s more, Trump appears to have very little hope for growth.",
        "At least 37 fishermen have drowned after a ship overturned in the Aegean Sea on the way to Greece, the Turkish Coast Guard says. The coast guard was able to save 75 children and continues to look for more bodies. At least 10 children were amongst the dead, including either toddlers or infants, The Associated Press reports.

The Peabody award winner first took over as host of the midday show for NPR member station WAMU in 1979 only though last year, Rehm announcing that she plans to retire shortly after the 2016 presidential election. That loss, in part, stems from her experience with the death of her husband, a event she chronicles in her new novel, On My Own.",

        "Great Teachers have two things in common : an exceptional level of care to their students, and the drive to lead each one to learn and work. At NPR Ed we \u2019 re just about halfway through our 50 Great Teachers list. We \u2019 ve profiled teachers at all levels, in all categories, from all over the country and overseas too. The book has taken us from Fort Drumright, Okla. to a mountaintop in Israel. From a jazz club in New Orleans to a Boy Scout troop in South Central LA to the spiritual world of ancient Egypt.",
        "Don\u2019t get bitten by mosquitoes. That\u2019s the advice offered to the public in virtually every article on the rapidly spreading, Zika virus. There\u2019s no arguing with the advice. Zika, once considered a relatively mild illness, has now been linked to a surge in severe birth defects in Brazil and possibly to cases of paralysis. But anyone who is a mosquito magnet must be asking: Can humans really keep the bloodsucking bugs at bay? To find out how people can best protect themselves. NPR talked with researchers, many of whom spend lots of time in jungles, marshes and tropical areas.",
        "The World Health Organization has described the advance of the Zika virus as \u201dexplosive.\u201d It was first detected in Brazil in 2015 and has spread to at least 22 countries since. The virus has been associated with severe birth defects in babies born to infected mothers. Officials have said an outbreak in the U. S. is unlikely, and might be contained in the more tropical regions. So far Puerto Rico has been the most affected, with 19 confirmed cases. Dr.",
        "There\u2019s football season, hunting season, and the holiday season. Overlapping all of these is something decidedly less fun and sexy: open enrollment season for health insurance. \u201dWe\u2019ve been busy this past month,\u201d says Iris Galvez, a health insurance navigator with the Houston social services agency Change Happens! Galvez helps people navigate the Healthcare. gov website and enroll in health plans offered through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. \u201dIt\u2019s the holidays, that makes it hard.

        "Ohio Gov. John Kasich is campaigning in New Hampshire today in advance of that state\u2019s presidential primary, which will be held one week from Tuesday. While most presidential candidates are spending this weekend in Iowa, Kasich is hoping to break out of the crowded Republican field in the Granite State, and said today if he doesn\u2019t, it may be the end of the road for his candidacy. \u201dIf I get snuffed out, I go home \u2014 end of story,\u201d Kasich said while urging voters to support him.

        "Readers have waited almost 15 years for a second novel from the acclaimed Alexander Chee, following the Edinburgh. The wait is over. The Queen Of The Night is sprawling, soaring, bawdy and plotted like a fine embroidery. Lilliet Berne is the most famous soprano in the French opera. She is offered the role of a lifetime: an original part written for her. But then she sees that the opera must be based on a part of her life she\u2019s kept under wraps. Who would so precisely, exquisitely and cruelly use her past against her?",
        "Every four years when the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary roll around, the critics and cynics question why such unrepresentative patches of America get to vote first in presidential nominating contests. Why is so much political power, they complain, given to states that are more white and more rural than the rest of the country? So, we attempted to quantitatively evaluate the critique \u2014 and try to come up with which states actually were the most representative of the average of the entire country, in what we\u2019re calling the Perfect State Index.",
        "With the Iowa caucuses just days away, the NPR Politics Podcast team is joined by special guest Clay Masters, the host of Morning Edition on Iowa Public Radio. Clay, who\u2019s covering the presidential campaign, talks about his experience knocking on doors with both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns. The team also looks at big moments from the latest,   Republican debate and gets into the latest evolution of social media in politics  \u2014   the negative Snapchat filter. Also, the results of our call for your best \u201d2 Corinthians walk into a bar. ..\u201d jokes. On the podcast:",
        "There are different ways to reach voters. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders delivers fiery speeches that fill concert halls and arenas. But generally speaking, people don\u2019t leave Hillary Clinton events ready to start a political revolution. Big speeches and soaring rhetoric really aren\u2019t her thing. Instead, the former secretary of state is trying to win voters over by being a wonk who delivers page after page of policy white papers. As Clinton makes her closing argument in Iowa, \u201din my plan\u201d has to be the most oft repeated phrase in her stump speech.",
        "#NPRreads is a weekly feature on Twitter and on The . The premise is simple: Correspondents, editors and producers from our newsroom share the pieces that have kept them reading, using the #NPRreads hashtag. Each weekend, we highlight some of the best stories. I have a soft spot in my heart for the New Hampshire primary. (I\u2019m writing this from my Manchester hotel room.) McCarthy\u2019s unexpected strong showing here in 1968 convinced President Lyndon Johnson not to run for .

        "Most of the time when we talk about homelessness, big cities come to mind. But about seven percent of homeless people live in rural areas, where access to help is much harder to come by. Flagstaff, Ariz. is one of those places. While city officials work to find solutions, one woman has taken an old motel and turned it into transitional housing. Route 66 runs through Flagstaff. And a lot of old rundown motels from its heyday still stand \u201d empty shells from a more prosperous time.",
        "Imagine if you could kill God. Literally just roll right up on him and shoot him in the face. Now imagine that it\u2019s gods, plural. And while putting them down isn\u2019t by any means easy, it is possible. You can kill them. All of them. And free the world from their dominion, their miracles, their slavery and oppression. Kill the gods and the world is sans divinity, sans magic. The playing field, once mountainous with privilege and lack, is now level. Just so long as those gods stay dead.",
        "For more than a decade, Anderson . Paak has been developing a kaleidoscopic mix of \u201960s funk, \u201970s soul, RB, electronic music, and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. When he appeared on Dr. Dre\u2019s surprise 2015 album Compton, . Paak\u2019s profile skyrocketed \u2014 and, some say, stole the show. Anderson .

        "Iowa\u2019s process of picking its choice for president is complicated. We try to demystify it in this space. Here are the basics: The word \u201dcaucus\u201d is thought to come from an Algonquin Indian word \u2014 cau\u00b4 \u00b4u, meaning \u201done who advises, urges, encourages\u201d and \u201dto talk to . .. give counsel, advise, encourage, and to urge, promote, incite to action.\u201d The short answer, It\u2019s essentially a neighborhood meeting of sorts \u2014 for politically active, people.",
        "Iowa and New Hampshire get a lot of attention, but their records in picking presidents, let alone nominees, is spotty (as you can see from the chart above). But that doesn\u2019t mean the states don\u2019t matter. They have been effective at weeding the field of candidates, and they\u2019re about momentum for those later states. Plus, in the last 40 years, just one person has gone on to win the presidency after losing both Iowa and New Hampshire \u2014 Bill Clinton.",
        "Donald Trump has not only caused deep divisions in the GOP establishment, but he\u2019s also exposed a stark divide within the evangelical community.

        "Ted Cruz has one of the most overtly religious stump speeches on the Iowa campaign trail. In Emmetsburg, Iowa, Friday the Texas senator quoted the Bible and exhorted his supporters to pray \u201deach and every day\u201d until Election Day. \u201dHe\u2019s real,\u201d said Bobbie Clark, a Cruz supporter from Algona. \u201dThere\u2019s something there.

        "Donald Trump said a final word to evangelical voters on Saturday by showing them the Word of God. In a Facebook video, the real estate mogul opens his Bible to thank \u201dthe evangelicals\u201d for the support they\u2019ve shown him in polls. \u201dMy mother gave me this Bible, this very Bible, many years ago,\u201d Trump says. \u201dIn fact, it\u2019s her writing, right here. She wrote the name, and my address, and it\u2019s just very special to me.\u201d He closes this way: \u201dI want to thank the evangelicals,\u201d he says."
