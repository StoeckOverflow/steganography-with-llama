        "Three attacks near a shrine owned by Shiite Muslims in Damascus have injured at least 45 people, according to reports from Syrian government and human rights advocates. NPR \u2019 s Alison Meuse, speaking from Beirut for our Newscast unit, said the Islamic State has gained responsibility through its media network. She continues : \u201d State officials say the first explosion was caused by a car crash at a local bus stop. Then, as people rushed to aid the wounded, two suicide bombers with explosive devices detonated themselves in the crowd.",
        "\u201d Full Moon \u201d is a phrase economists used to explain how the job offer recovers from a recession. We \u2019 ll be hearing this story a lot as the Labor Council releases the latest employment data on Friday. It \u2019 s meant to show that employers want even more workers in return. But the phrase doesn \u2019 t tell the real story for millions of workers either still out of job or who are looking for something less than work. What is full unemployment and what does it mean?",
        "One way down, two to go. For working adults in 22 states, that \u2019 s how often they can count on help with the food bills : Starting this job, they have three months to get a job or lose their employer assistance. SNAP benefits \u2014 commonly known as food subsidies \u2014 have been tied to employment for several decades. Unless they are available for children or unable to pay, adults need to have a family to receive more than three years of benefits.",
        "Over the past 25 years, there \u2019 s been no more prominent name in pop music than Kirk Franklin. In that time, the singer has been no party to controversy. By merging with King, he brought the stars and leaders of the club scene into the spotlight \u2014 and not everyone in the church has been associated with that. Franklin continues to gain audiences with his latest record, titled Losing My Religion. He met with NPR \u2019 s Michel Moore about pursuing faith without dogma, and why he wants to make God a cultural celebrity.",
        "Living on the road is tough enough in a city. But when you \u2019 re homeless in rural America, it \u2019 s even harder to bring yourself out of poverty. In the small city of Flagstaff, Ariz. one woman needed to make a difference, and converted an old motel into affordable housing. When former financial planner Lori Barlow came to Flagstaff, she volunteered at the emergency department. She was overwhelmed by the number of residents stuck in poverty. \u201d I was surprised we had people staying there that had help, \u201d Barlow says. \u201d And that just bothered me.",
        "As many say, parenting isn \u2019 t an easy job. It can be hugely frustrating and get lonely trying to find out what \u2019 s best for your kid. Should you be a taskmaster or a good friend? Is there a middle school? The pressures of work and relationships can make that question even more challenging to tackle. J. Leonard Sax has experience in challenging these relationships as a family psychologist and psychologist in Pennsylvania. His latest book, The Collapse Of Parenting : How We Hurt Our Parents When We Treat Them Like Grown Ups is informed Sax \u2019 s personal and professional observations.",
        "Monday \u2019 s political caucuses are being billed, as they are every subsequent season, as \u201d a fight for the dominance of the Party, \u201d both Democratic and Republicans. Yes, it \u2019 s a clich\u00e9, but especially on the Democratic side this year, it \u2019 s a political battle. For some insight into the politics and the state of the GOP, we \u2019 ve turned to some new Republicans : Chelsi Henry, 27, was the last elected woman in the city of Jacksonville, Fla. Will Estrada, 32, works as an ambassador for a nonprofit in Northern Florida.",
        "The armed standoff between terrorists and law enforcement in California has lasted more than four decades. After the arrest of 11 people last week, it was expected that the leadership of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge would come to an end, but the killing of the group \u2019 s commander in an encounter with police has begun. We have been here before. Back in the 1990s, there were several showdowns between Islamic extremists and the federal government. One of the longest standoffs involved the Freemen of Louisiana in 1996, who held out for 81 days before surrendering back to law enforcement.",
        "Hundreds of millions of refugees fleeing their countries by boat. That \u2019 s Syria today. It \u2019 s also Vietnam in 1979. V\u00f5 left Vietnam more than a decade after that, and under two different circumstances : She was never an musician, bound for Carnegie Hall. But the plight of her countrymen, and that of today \u2019 s Vietnamese, has inspired her to create a great concert piece that will be touring the country. V\u00f5 grew up in Hanoi, struggling with the legacy of the Vietnam war. Her family \u2019 s washbasin was an old glass shell.",
        "Can drone racing be the next NASCAR? That \u2019 s what Matt Horbaczewski is banking on. He is the CEO of the Drone Racing League, and he has lined up contacts in venture capital to add his vision to reality. Riding quadcopters with onboard cameras and virtual reality goggles, pilots race the drones through fast courses with hairpin turns, drops and precipitous drops. The perspective lets spectators watching the simulation videos online appears as if they are in the cockpit too, racing at dizzying speeds of 80 mph or more.",
        "There is a joke circulating in San Salvador these days: \u201dInstead of using a condom, use a mosquito net! That should at least keep the mosquitoes from biting your privates.\u201d The joke is a dig at the unusual suggestion made by the governments of El Salvador and various other Latin American countries. Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador (as well as Jamaica) have advised that women hold off on getting pregnant. El Salvador went as far as to urge women to hold back on having children until 2018.",
        "Before the Zika virus outbreak, which appears to be associated with serious birth defects in babies in Brazil, there was rubella, also known as German measles, which terrified the pregnant women of my mother\u2019s generation. In the rubella pandemic, an estimated 50, 000 pregnant women in the United States were exposed to rubella in pregnancy, resulting in miscarriages, stillbirths, and 20, 000 babies born with congenital rubella syndrome, which caused blindness, deafness, brain and heart damage. At the height of the pandemic, an estimated 1 of every 100 babies born in Philadelphia was afflicted.",

All of the animals you see come in three sexes. There is the usual male and female \u2014 and there\u2019s also a third sex called zplif. Male, female and zplif. That would pretty weird, right? You\u2019d have a lot of questions about zplifs. What are they like? How does, you know, it all work? And, most of all, how come you didn\u2019t know about this before?",
        "North Korea is a mysterious place \u2014 even to South Koreans. Curiosity about life in the north has sparked a slew of new South Korean TV shows. There is the Amazing program, in which North Korean women are paired up with South Korean men to take on various challenges, like trudging through mud carrying a bucket of water on their heads.

        "Was Andy Warhol a collector of beautiful and mundane things, or was he a hoarder? Did Abraham Lincoln suffer from melancholia, or was he clinically depressed? Did Albert Einstein have autism? These are the questions journalist Claudia Kalb seeks to answer in her new book, Andy Warhol Was A Hoarder: Inside The Minds Of History\u2019s Great Personalities. Kalb tells NPR\u2019s Rachel Martin how she went about diagnosing the historic figures she talks about in her book.

        "In Flint, Mich. families are using bottled water to do everything \u2014 from cooking to bathing. The tap water is still unsafe to drink after government officials allowed corroded lead pipes to poison the water. People in Flint have lots of questions for those officials. Perhaps the biggest is the one Hattie Collins has. \u201dWhen are you gonna fix it? And I mean fix it right,\u201d she says. On a recent day, Collins is distributing bottled water at Triumph Church in Flint. A massive is parked in front of the church. It\u2019s from Columbus, Ohio.",
        "Stephanie Hundley is an enthusiastic Bernie Sanders supporter. The from Waterloo is also enthusiastic about the fact that she\u2019s not going to vote for Hillary Clinton just because she\u2019s a woman. \u201dI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the woman to be representative of women,\u201d Hundley said. She ticked off a list of Clinton criticisms: the \u201ddamn emails,\u201d the \u201d\u201d her vote to go to war in Iraq. Citing Sanders\u2019 record of supporting women\u2019s rights, Hundley said his overall views embody hers more than Clinton\u2019s do.",
        "As presidential candidates crisscrossed Iowa just before caucus day, their campaign committees and friendly superPACs disclosed how much they raised and spent in 2015. The reports included the first disclosure of big money from Republican Donald Trump \u2014 $12. 6 million \u2014 and the precarious state of Jeb Bush\u2019s White House bid: his campaign finished the year with $7. 6 million in the bank, while the superPAC Right To Rise USA had raised $118. 3 million but burned through more than half of it.",
        "The Iowa caucuses are known for hoisting the hopeful to glory. But for each skyrocket that actually launched here, many more have fizzled on the pad. The slick talkers auditioning for media gigs. The household name whose prominence fails to translate. The ambitious seeking name recognition for the future. The nonpolitician who strikes a nerve the year before the election year. After Iowa, the bell tolls for these. For every Obama . .. When you think about Barack Obama breaking out in Iowa in 2008, think also of the candidates whose bids broke down: Sen. Joe Biden, . Gov.",
        "Finally, after more than 10 months of campaigning from more than a dozen presidential candidates, voters get to weigh in. Iowa Republicans and Democrats will caucus Monday night, and the results could at long last provide some clarity to the Republican and Democratic nominating contests \u2014 or not. Here are five things we\u2019re watching: How many voters show up Monday night makes a difference. Voting in a caucus is harder than voting in a primary. Iowans have to show up at their caucus site at a specific time and in some cases stay there for a couple of hours.",
        "The first real votes of the 2016 presidential election will be cast at the Iowa caucuses tonight, starting at 8 p. m. ET. And that means there are a lot of questions in the air. Will Donald Trump\u2019s lead in the polls translate to dominance in the caucus rooms? Will Iowa voters feel the Bern? What\u2019s the mood like on the ground? (You\u2019ll find answers at NPR Politics, with a wide range of reporting and analysis on the candidates, the voters and what it all means.) What\u2019s going on right now?",

        "Starting in 2016, the federal health law requires small employers to offer their workers health insurance. In anticipation of the change, some restaurants looked to get around the law by making more workers part time. Now some owners are rethinking that approach. At a Burger King off Highway 99 in California\u2019s Central Valley, a workers in black uniforms scurry around, grabbing packets of ketchup and stuffing paper bags with french fries. Tiana Mua has worked here part time for almost a year. She\u2019d like to be full time, but at this Burger King only the managers are full time.",
        "Farm subsidies don\u2019t lack for critics. conservatives and welfare liberals alike have called for deep cuts in these payments to farmers. After all, farmers, as a group, are wealthier than the average American. Why should they get tens of billions of dollars each year in federal aid? Two years ago, when the most recent Farm Bill emerged from Congress, the measure\u2019s authors proudly announced what sounded like bold cuts in these controversial programs. The Senate Agriculture Committee noted in a press release that the new law would eliminate one big subsidy altogether and save taxpayers a total of $23.",
        "Four U. S. senators are calling on the Army to stop kicking out soldiers who served in Iraq or Afghanistan and have been diagnosed with mental health problems or traumatic brain injuries \u2014 effective immediately.

        "When some Western musicians picture life in India, they seem to think you can\u2019t turn a corner without someone blasting you in the face with brightly colored powder. Like, you get a knock on the door, and it\u2019s the delivery guy, but he can\u2019t just hand you your bag of food and be done with it. First, it\u2019s two fistfuls of mustard yellow to the head and chest area, and then a little peacock green down your shirt \u2019cause you didn\u2019t tip.",
        "Back in the early 1960s, Philip Roth wrote a famous essay declaring that modern American life had gotten so delirious that it dwarfed fiction\u2019s ability to match it.
