        "Praying for rain? You \u2019 ll hear ( slightly ) less when the tide is very high, a new hypothesis finds. Scientists at the University of Washington say the sun \u2019 s position impacts the effect of rainfall on Earth. \u201d As far as I know, this is the first place to convincingly connect the tidal activity of the moon with rainfall, \u201d Professor Tsubasa Kohyama says in a press release from the university.",
        "If the advice to add more fiber seems easier to ignore, you \u2019 re not alone. Most women don \u2019 t get the 25 to 38 grams a month that \u2019 s recommended, depending on diet and gender. But if you \u2019 re skimping on fiber, the food stakes are high, even if you \u2019 re a teenage girl. A study published Monday in the American Pediatrics concludes that eating portions of foods during high school years may help reduce a woman \u2019 s chances of developing breast cancer. The findings are based on a survey of 44, 000 women who were surveyed about their eating habits in high school.",
        "When the NHL \u2019 s extravaganza ended, John Scott was nervous about whether his teammates would accept him, a journeyman enforcer who was voted in by the NHL and is now on an AHL team. When it came, he worried the NHL \u2019 s players might drop him when they pulled him onto their shoulders. \u201d I was worried, scared, \u201d Scott replied. \u201d I am not a very light guy \u2014 I \u2019 m almost 275 pounds, when I \u2019 m soaking wet I \u2019 m about 300 pounds. It was....",
        "Babies get a transplant from their mothers. But babies affected by cesarean section don \u2019 t pass through the birth canal and miss out on the chance from picking up Mom \u2019 s microbes on the way out. Researchers studying the viral microbiome have asked : Could there be a way to fix that? If so, it might help restore the microbes a baby mother gets that help ward off disease and foster future development. A small study published Monday in Molecular Medicine provides tantalizing proof that it may be possible. How?",
        "Egypt has an old law known as the \u201d seasonal marriage \u201d law, and the ministry says it \u2019 s aimed at assisting the many poor women who resort to selling their possessions into temporary or marriages with poor, older foreign men to support themselves. Egypt \u2019 s Justice Ministry says it will begin strictly enforcing that law, which requires foreign men \u2014 refugees from Gulf countries \u2014 to decide to marry women 25 years or more their junior. And it \u2019 s increasing the standards the men must take. All this, it says, is to protect poor women.",
        "About 40 years later, when she was 24, Consuelo Hermosillo had an emergency caesarean section at Los Angeles Medical Center. In the new documentary No M\u00e1s Beb\u00e9s, she recalls asking her doctor what type of birth control she should take going forward. \u201d He says, \u2019 You don \u2019 t need anything. We bought your tubes, \u2019 \u201d Hermosillo says in the interview. \u201d And I said, \u2019 Why? \u2019 And he said, \u2019 Well you signed for it. \u2019 And I said, \u2019 Me? \u2019 \u201d No M\u00e1s Beb\u00e9s ( No More Babies ) which debuted on PBS on Feb.",
        "Any day now, Pierre Lecomte will plunge into the Pacific Ocean off a deserted beach toward San Francisco. He wants to become the first person to swim across the Pacific. He \u2019 s also the first person to successfully swim across the Pacific Ocean, without a kickboard. No one knows how the physical activity of swimming 5, 500 miles will affect Lecomte \u2019 s heart, but cardiologists are anxious to find out. His swim offers a perfect opportunity to study whether extreme athletic competition has a harmful effect on the body.",
        "The question of who is good and who is left out is rocking the ship these days, from Hollywood to Hollywood. And, in Venice, Calif. representation is at the bottom 19 dramatic portraits, now on display at the L. A. Louver. The paintings are of many female artists, all working right now in Los Angeles. Campbell felt women artists are not getting noticed in museums and galleries, feeling invisible. \u201d I thought, yeah, what I can do is I make pictures, \u201d Campbell explains.",
        "How much harm can the Zika virus do? That \u2019 s the question that is bedeviling life in Brazil. It \u2019 s not just the matter of a potential link to brain tumors in babies born to children who contracted the virus during pregnancy. There have also been suspected cases of adult patients who receive temporary hearing problems. Researchers are trying to make sense of it all, and yet they share very basic information. Certainly the number of cases and the extent to which it has spread are unknown. That makes it hard to figure out the health impact of Zika.",
        "Health officials have confirmed that someone in Dallas County, Texas, spread the Zika virus through sexual intercourse. It \u2019 s the first U. S. virus related to the recent Eastern Hemisphere outbreak to be infected through sex. Until now, experts have disagreed on transmission of the virus through mosquito control. Dallas County Health and Human Services reported the patient, who remains pregnant, became infected after having sexual contact with someone who was female and had returned from a country where the Zika virus is present.",
        "The current Zika virus got its start in Brazil, and that country is still the epicenter of the plague. But could the situation in western Venezuela be nearly as dire? That \u2019 s the charge being made by some environmental \u2019 groups, who claim the Venezuelan government is vastly underestimating the number of cases. The government estimates that almost 3, 700 people have likely been infected with Zika since the outbreak started last year. These people believe the number is equivalent to 400, 000 \u2014 and that estimate only covers people who showed symptoms of HIV.",
        "It \u2019 s been a month since armed militants taking over the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon, and even though the leaders of that occupation have been released, the community of Harney County finds itself deeply divided. That dispute erupted on Monday in the midst of a huge shouting battle on the steps of the county courthouse in Burns, Ore. It \u2019 s a small crowd of about 2, 700 people, so it \u2019 s not every day that you see 400 or 500 people out on the square, screaming at each other.",
        "Emad, a Damascus merchant, says he is starting to feel at home in the northwestern Syrian city of Haarlem. The comes on hand to meet me at the city \u2019 s bus station, where I traveled from Amsterdam to meet him in November. \u201d It \u2019 s different, it reminds me a lot of Damascus, \u201d he says. \u201d Because it has the old buildings, then it goes modern and it changes to old buildings [ again ]. So it gives me a warm feeling to be here. \u201d Despite winter cold, hundreds of thousands of migrants start to arrive on the European continent.",
        "Last month\u2019s dramatic arrest of El Chapo, the world\u2019s most powerful drug trafficker, brought to mind one of the most gruesome stories in the history of smuggling \u2014 one that involved not cocaine, but a substance equally light and easy to transport: tea. In 18th century England, tea smuggling was a thriving enterprise. Steep taxes on tea made it unaffordable to the ordinary farm hand and factory worker, who craved a cuppa as much as an aristocrat did. A number of smuggling networks offered them a steady and cheap supply of tea.",
        "Hillary Clinton got lucky Monday night. Very lucky. But not for the reasons some are alleging. Some have attributed her squeaker of a victory over Bernie Sanders in the Iowa Democratic presidential caucuses to an improbable lucky streak of tiebreaking coin tosses. It\u2019s been reported that there were as many as six sites where ties were decided by the flip of a coin \u2014 and Clinton won every single one. The odds of that happening are 1 in 64, or less than 2 percent.",
        "Donald Trump thought he could upend Iowa caucus traditions. The gamble didn\u2019t pay off. Hillary Clinton hoped she could wipe away her campaign nightmares of eight years ago by posting a solid win over an insurgent Bernie Sanders. Instead, her margin of victory over Sanders was vanishingly small. Those were just some of the surprise twists from Monday night\u2019s results. Here\u2019s what the numbers and results tell us about how and why they happened, according to our analysis of the polling and the results. 1.",
        "Coin tosses, a squeaker of a win and, perhaps even more surprising, humility. That\u2019s what marked Monday night\u2019s Iowa caucuses, the first votes cast in the 2016 presidential election. The presidential candidates are now focused on New Hampshire, where polls put Bernie Sanders ahead of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ahead of Ted Cruz, the Union Leader reports. The New Hampshire primaries will be held next Tuesday, Feb. 9. Here\u2019s a roundup of headlines from the morning after the Iowa campaign.",
        "Scientists still can\u2019t predict an earthquake. The U. S. government, however, has a warning system in the works that it hopes could quickly send out a widespread alarm before most people feel a rumble \u2014 and save lives when seconds count. The recently upgraded network of seismometers and computers, known as ShakeAlert, is advancing through the stage, Sally Jewell, secretary of the U. S. Department of the Interior, said at a news conference Tuesday.",
        "Breaking the fourth wall is like putting gold leaf on a dessert: good for a quick jolt of surprise and superficial specialness, but the more common it becomes in the culture, the less impressive its deployment by any particular creator. We are in a moment, particularly in matters of elite corruption.",
        "On this week\u2019s All Songs Considered, we\u2019ve got several new favorites including Bob Boilen\u2019s No. 1 discovery of 2016 so far, Lucy Dacus. Robin Hilton shares songs by several artists he thinks are about to release their best albums yet, including Santigold and Ane Brun.",
        "Twenty years ago, when the O. J. Simpson verdict was delivered, actor Courtney B. Vance says he celebrated \u2014 but he wasn\u2019t exactly cheering for the former NFL player. \u201dI cheered for Emmett Till,\u201d \u2014 the teenager lynched in Mississippi in 1955 \u2014 he says. \u201dI cheered for all the strange fruit that hung on the trees for three centuries.\u201d For a long time, he says, black people had nowhere to go for justice. And that\u2019s why he cheered for Simpson\u2019s lawyer, Johnnie Cochran.",
        "In a recent Skype call with a Dutch friend, we discussed her kids and their college experience. Apparently, there had been protests on campus about costs and payments. \u201dHow much are they paying now?\u201d I asked, gritting my teeth in preparation for the answer. \u201dWell,\u201d she said, \u201dit\u2019s now about 1, 800 euro a year.\u201d Wow. My friend\u2019s kids are going to some of the best universities in the world and, in the end, that education will cost them less than $8, 000. Compare that to the U. S.",
        "A landmark deal 10 years in the making will protect 9. 1 millions acres of Canadian rain forest on the Pacific Coast of British Columbia. The protected area in the Great Bear Rainforest is about half the size of Ireland. The new order \u2014 reached between aboriginal groups known as First Nations, environmental groups and logging companies \u2014 designates 85 percent of the forest land as permanently protected from logging. The remaining 15 percent of the forest will be \u201davailable for logging, supporting local jobs,\u201d a press statement from the British Columbia government says.",
        "The Super Bowl is still five days away, but for advertisers the game is already in full swing. Once upon a time, companies that shelled out for a coveted Super Bowl ad jealously guarded their commercials until they aired during the big game. Nowadays, it works a little differently. Companies have realized the value of releasing teaser commercials or even full advertisements before Super Bowl Sunday, trading the element of surprise for the possibility of having their ad go viral.",
        "Saru Jayaraman may be restaurant obsessed, but don\u2019t call her a foodie. She\u2019s the founding director of the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, a national organization that advocates for better wages and working conditions for restaurant workers. She\u2019s also published several studies in legal and policy journals as director of the Food Labor Research Center at the University of . The combination of grassroots and ivory tower makes Jayaraman arguably one of the country\u2019s leading experts on what it\u2019s like to live as a restaurant worker in America.",
        "Writer Yann Martel is best known for his 2001 book Life of Pi, about a teenage boy adrift at sea with a Bengal tiger. Now Martel has a new novel called The High Mountains of Portugal. It\u2019s made up of three interlocking stories that cover almost a century. Like Life of Pi, The High Mountains of Portugal is about journeys and it also features an animal (this time a chimpanzee). Martel tells NPR\u2019s Ari Shapiro that his new novel continues an exploration of faith that began with Life of Pi.",
        "Tech companies and privacy advocates have been in a stalemate with government officials over how encrypted communication affects the ability of federal investigators to monitor terrorists and other criminals. A new study by Harvard\u2019s Berkman Center for Internet and Society convened experts from all sides to put the issue in context. The report concluded that information from some apps and devices like smartphones may be harder for government investigators to intercept because of stronger encryption.",
        "A memo from congressional investigators sheds new light on the inner workings of Martin Shkreli\u2019s Turing Pharmaceuticals after the company jacked up the prices of a drug used to treat AIDS patients. The House Committee on Oversight and Investigations is looking into Turing and other drug companies\u2019 price increases. This memo, released Tuesday, includes excerpts from the company\u2019s internal documents and emails. It paints a picture of the \u201dpharma bro\u201d Martin Shkreli giddily rubbing his palms together at the prospect of all the money Daraprim will generate for his fledgling company.",
        "Patients suffered no additional harm when doctors training to be surgeons were allowed to work longer shifts, a study published Tuesday concludes. The findings provide fresh evidence for medical educators looking to relax the strictest limits on resident hours. The study in the New England Journal of Medicine comes as the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education is reassessing requirements that prevent residents from working extremely long stretches or shifts. Those rules were enacted in 2003 and strengthened in 2011 amid concerns that residents were more likely to make serious errors.",
        "As recreational use of drones around the world continues to soar, authorities have been forced to get creative with how they deal with drones that fly into restricted airspace. In December, Tokyo police launched a drone designed to take out other drones with a net. In October, British tech companies unveiled a drone \u201ddeath ray\u201d that can disable drones in midflight. Now, police in the Netherlands are turning to nature for another possible solution: eagles. The birds of prey are a \u201d solution to a problem,\u201d a police spokesman told Reuters."
