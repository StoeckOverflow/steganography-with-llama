        "A few weeks earlier, I ate three layers of cake on a single night. All in the name of research, of celebration. You see, it was Jan. 6, popularly known as Epiphany or Kings Day \u2014 and in New Orleans, that marked the start of Carnival history. And that means we eat Christmas cake. Mardi Gras, or Fat Sunday, is, of course, a single celebration : Feb. 9 this year.
