        "Employers are pushing hard to get in shape and stay more fit through workplace wellness policies. But if employers use muscle mass index as a yardstick for benefits, then that could unfairly penalize millions of employees, a study finds. Researchers contend that BMI \u2019 s usefulness ends at a rough indication that a patient should be checked for symptoms like high blood pressure or cholesterol. \u201d It \u2019 s a preliminary diagnostic tool. Higher BMI is consistent with higher health status, but it \u2019 s not a health state, \u201d says Dr.",
        "Editor \u2019 s note : Some may find the brief descriptions in this post disturbing. When I walked into my first new reality experience next week at Sundance Film Festival, there was no movie studio or screening room to find. It consisted only of a single, metal desk chair and a virtual reality ( VR ) headset sitting on a tray. I settled into the chair and, with the support of Sharon Nunez and Jose Perez of the organization Animal Rescue, strapped on the headset.",
        "Jazz Ensemble In America \u2019 s regular writer, Christian McBride, used to be a bassist and composer, but he forbade musicians to feature him unless it was for something special. It so happens that he \u2019 s created a special work : Teaming with artistic director JD Steele, he \u2019 s written a bluesy and soulful oratorio for big band, gospel choir with soloists, and four composers who represent great ideals of the Civil Rights Movement. It \u2019 s called The Movement Revisited, and is inspired by the written words and poetry of Rosa Parks, Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali, Martin Luther King Jr. and President Barack Obama.",
        "For Carnival in August, lots of women don short feather headdresses and skimpy bikinis. But for a event, Ana Cuoto is dressed as a mosquito \u2014 complete with a red proboscis and gossamer wings. She is part of a crowd of health workers attracted by a metro station in a district of Rio \u2019 s north downtown. A few others are wearing mosquito nets as well. And they \u2019 re singing a catchy chorus : \u201d If Zika attacks, use this phone to report it,. Pay back! \u201d By putting the number to use, public health authorities hope it will stick in commuters \u2019 soon.",
        "In my house coming up, the walls of every bedroom \u2014 including the bathroom \u2014 were lined with several calendars. ( Is this a thing? An extended family thing? I \u2019 ve always wondered. ) Subject matter didn \u2019 t matter. My mom tacked up the glossy freebies mailed to us by various insurance agencies, featuring flowery landscapes and fancy muscle cars. These sat next to the calendars handed out to kids at the 99 Ranch grocery checkout counters, which featured the same image all day long : the Chinese Feng Fu \u2014 \u201d luck \u201d \u2014 carved in brush calligraphy and gold hearts on crimson card table.",
        "For the past 40 years, New Hampshire \u2019 s Republican status has been vigorously governed by one man : Secretary of State Bill Gardner. He is the nation \u2019 s secretary of State, taking office in 1976, one year before New Hampshire lawmakers mandated that the Granite State finish first in primary election. Gardner \u2019 s office in New Hampshire \u2019 s ( of course ) White House is like a maze through the state \u2019 s political history. It \u2019 s filled with stacks of policy forms, political paraphernalia \u2014 and dozens of photographs of presidential opponents on the stump.",
        "\u201d Squat! Squat! Squat! Higher! Faster! \u201d In the gymnasium of the Duane Physics and Astrophysics building at the University of Colorado Boulder, a little demonstration is going on, but it feels more like a vaudeville act. One by one, riders balance precariously on a rotating wheel. Then they are handed what looks like a spinning bicycle wheel, holding it by two gears that stick out from either end of what would be the hub of the bike. When you flip the wheel over, like a pizza, your body begins rotating in the opposite direction.",
        "Note : Heaven \u2019 s First Listen list comes down after the album is finished. However, you can still click with the Spotify playlist at the bottom of the page. Just before The Suffers \u2019 fully begin performing, you \u2019 ll hear 20 arms stretched in the air followed by 10 voices. The crowd counts off, 1 to 10, then shouts fast and hard at full band capacity. That \u2019 s just the warmup. What you get from this new band is soul, flowing from horn to heart. I \u2019 ve seen The Suffers \u2019 magnificence on a tiny stage in a D. P.",
        "Food producer Bee Wilson has a moment of hope for parents working to get their children to eat their veggies : \u201d As parents, we have a far bigger power than we think we have to improve children \u2019 s tastes, \u201d Wilson tells Fresh Digest \u2019 s Terry Gross. In her second book, First Bite, Wilson examines how genetics, genetics, memory and early feeding patterns contribute to our eating preferences. She says that a child \u2019 s palate can be formed even before birth. And this insight can be helpful for mothers who want their children to eat well and healthfully.",
        "The world of haute cuisine lost one of its brightest minds over the weekend. Benoit Violier, a French professional chef who many thought was the best in the world, died in his home in Switzerland in what seemed to have been a suicide. He was 44. Violier owned the Ch\u00e2teau de l \u2019 H\u00f4tel de Ville in Crissier, near Lille. It \u2019 s one of the few restaurants in the country to be awarded three Michelin stars. There has been some speculation that the pressure that comes with operating a restaurant at that restaurant may have had something to do with Violier \u2019 s suicide.",
        "Americans are obsessed with celebrity chefs. We talk about them, tweet about them and continue to eat like them. But could we learn something more from them than strategy and technique? According to Marketdata Institute, Americans spend nearly $ 10 billion a year on and behind organization products. The savings is huge, partly because most university and grad schools don \u2019 t teach basic organization. But culinary schools and private kitchens do. Perhaps the principles of culinary training can be extended to help serve those of us who aren \u2019 t top chefs.",
        "News services say at least 14 people, including a baby and a man, have been killed in an earthquake in Taiwan. A magnitude 6. 4 quake shook the southern city of Tainan just before 4 a. m. local time Saturday. The shallow quake caused severe damage to several large structures, including one residential building where authorities say hundreds live.

        "There aren\u2019t a lot of people who have dined on meat from the Pleistocene, prehistoric humans notwithstanding. That\u2019s why accounts of the 1951 Annual Dinner of the Explorers Club, a society of scientific adventurers, all agree that the organizer of the night, Wendell Phillips Dodge, threw the dinner party of the century. Legend has it that Dodge served the meat of a woolly mammoth. Or was it an extinct giant ground sloth? Reports were inconsistent as to which prehistoric animal Dodge procured for the reception.",
        "In a year where so many Republican voters are angry at Washington, it can be tough to have two former presidents in your family. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has struggled with that dynamic his entire campaign \u2014 sometimes embracing the Bush legacy, and sometimes holding it at arm\u2019s length. (The campaign logo is Jeb! not Bush!) Bush has now decided to fully lean into his family\u2019s 12 years in the White House. Former President George W. Bush just cut an ad for a superPAC. On Thursday night in Derry, N. H.",
        "There are plenty of political punches being thrown around the GOP field these days. Christie knocks Bush. Bush knocks Trump. Trump knocks Cruz . .. you get the point. But this past week, they\u2019ve homed in on one particular punching bag: Marco Rubio. It\u2019s one side effect of his finish in Iowa and subsequent growth spurt in New Hampshire. As NPR\u2019s Scott Detrow recently reported, there is in the Granite State \u2014 something a flurry of new polling data support. The punches are varied \u2014 some say the Florida senator is inexperienced. Some say he\u2019s inconsistent.",
        "With the Iowa caucuses in the books, the focus of the political world has shifted to the state, New Hampshire. New Hampshire voters, with their contrarian reputation, head to the polls Tuesday. Expect the unexpected. Here are five things to know about how it all works: 1. Voting is straightforward, Kudos to those of you who mastered the complex caucus system that Iowa uses to pick its presidential nominees. But now you can breathe a sigh of relief. In New Hampshire, it is much more straightforward. Anonymous ballots are cast at regular voting locations.",

        "When the Carolina Panthers play the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 50, Panthers coach Ron Rivera will become the second Latino head coach in Super Bowl history. And he\u2019s one reason why many in Charlotte\u2019s Latino community have become so enthusiastic about American football. Rivera says his interest in football started early. \u201dGrowing up, one of my role models was my uncle, who\u2019s half Mexican and half Filipino,\u201d he says. \u201dCulturally, to be accepted, my uncles all grew up playing football and baseball and basketball.\u201d His father is Puerto Rican and his mother is Mexican.",
        "On Friday\u2019s All Things Considered, I have a story about how a recent federal court ruling is restricting when police may use Tasers in the five Southeastern states covered by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. In a nutshell, police there may no longer shock a nonviolent, noncooperative suspect with a Taser stun gun \u2014 even if he is trying to escape custody. But the ruling isn\u2019t only about Tasers. It has deeper implications for police use of force, generally speaking. What surprised the experts are the reasons the judges gave in the ruling.",
        "The Jordanian movie Theeb has been nominated for a best foreign language film Oscar. It\u2019s a beautiful, sweeping story set in 1916 in an area of western Saudi Arabia then known as the Hejaz.

        "The Zika virus has gone from an obscure disease to an international public health emergency. Researchers have been able to trace the gradual spread of Zika \u2014 slowly for decades and then, in the words of World Health Organization head Dr. Margaret Chan, \u201dexplosively\u201d since 2015, when it was first detected in Brazil. Now the virus has reached more than 20 countries and territories in the Americas. In Brazil, there have been cases.

        "U. S. health experts cautioned Friday that the apparent discovery of the Zika virus in saliva and urine from people in Brazil does not necessarily mean the virus can be spread by more casual contact with infected people, such as through kissing. \u201dI think we need to be careful that don\u2019t we jump to any conclusions about transmissibility,\u201d Anthony Fauci, who leads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during an interview on NPR\u2019s Morning Edition.",
        "The new movie, Rams, has absolutely nothing to do with Peyton Manning. It\u2019s a story from Iceland that involves sheep, snow, a virus called scrapie and sufficient sibling rivalry to power a Greek tragedy. We\u2019re introduced to brothers Gummi and Kiddi Bodvarsson on their neighboring farms in a remote Icelandic valley. Their barns are less than 100 yards apart.

        "Take a look at this question: How do modern novels represent the characteristics of humanity? If you were tasked with answering it, what would your first step be? Would you scribble down your thoughts \u2014 or would you Google it? Terry Heick, a former English teacher in Kentucky, had a surprising revelation when his and students quickly turned to Google. \u201dWhat they would do is they would start Googling the question, \u2019How does a novel represent humanity?\u2019 \u201d Heick says.",
        "The cystic fibrosis drug Orkambi can help people with specific genetic mutations breathe better, but treatment with the pill comes with a hefty sticker price \u2014 $259, 000 a year.

        "The decision by Hillary Clinton to use a private email server as secretary of state has spawned an FBI investigation, multiple congressional inquiries and dozens of private lawsuits that demand copies of her messages. It\u2019s also become an issue in her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Republicans on the campaign trail have raised the prospect that Clinton could be charged with a crime \u2014 even as she downplays the FBI probe and asserts she wants voters to be able to see all of her messages from that time."
