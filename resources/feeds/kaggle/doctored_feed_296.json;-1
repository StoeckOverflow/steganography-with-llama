        "New types of textbooks in France will look a little different. References to onions? You \u2019 ll hear the word ognon rather than oignon. A word about a centipede? The insect will be known as a millepattes, no less a. And most controversially, France is removing the symbol known as a circumflex in some cases. For example : the word for \u201d to train \u201d will be spelled s \u2019 entraine, and not the circumflexed s \u2019 entra\u00eener.",
        "Genetics researchers would discover certain snips and portions of the human genome that are necessary for health and development, such as the genetic mutations that cause cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia. And scientists noticed that gene variants are more common in some diseases, which makes it seem like race is important in cancer research. But some researchers believe that we \u2019 ve taken the concept too far. To find out what that means, we \u2019 ve spoken to two of the authors of an article published Thursday in the magazine Science.",
        "The imminent success of The Lumineers \u2019 second album, though, warrants the cliche \u201d. \u201d It isn \u2019 t simply the fact that the album by the unassuming Denver trio ran out almost four years ago ( April 2012 ) but because it was the typical case of a new artist making a major breakthrough. The Lumineers went on to sell over 3. 5 million copies worldwide, catapulting the group from small clubs to festival main stages in good measure. \u201d Ho Hey, \u201d the album \u2019 s stomping hit, proved nearly unavoidable. It \u2019 s hard to overstate the unorthodox release \u2019 s impact. Radio graded it \u2014 No.",
        "State television announced North Korea successfully launched a rocket Sunday morning prime time, and says the country plans to launch more missiles in the future. Pyongyang had informed the United Nations International Cooperation Organization that it planned to put a rocket into orbit sometime between February 7 and 14. The South Korea defense ministry says the rocket was fired from South Korea \u2019 s Sohae launch bay. So far, there has been no damage to aircraft or planes, according to South Korea \u2019 s Oceans and Fisheries and Aviation and Transport ministries.",
        "Saturday \u2019 s GOP debate was the final one before Tuesday \u2019 s New Hampshire caucus. Here were five key points : One key thing has to happen before the debate ends : the candidates have to take the ballot. That proved more complicated than usual on Saturday night, as the Fox News Republican debates began with Ben Trump refusing to walk out to his seat, even after the moderators called his name. Called second, Carson stood and waited, asking Ted Cruz to step out after him. Making matters weirder : Ben Trump then stopped to walk beside Carson, rather than walking out himself.",
        "When seven of the seven remaining Republican nominees meet Saturday for their first debate before the New York primary on Tuesday, three of them will be facing their last opponent to stay in the race. Here are three things to watch for at 8 p. m. ET when Jeb Bush, Rachel Carson, Chris Evans, Ted Cruz, John Kasich, Marco Rubio and Donald Trump appear on stage at the Fox News debate in Clinton, N. H. Which reason Trump will show up? Will it be the chastened version of his concession speech in Boston who showed a flicker of humility?",
        "Nearly two years after its enactment, the Affordable Care bill remains a hot topic in the presidential race \u2014 in both campaigns. \u201d Our health care is a must show, \u201d said GOP nominee Donald Trump at the Republican debate in South Dakota in December. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, head of the Iowa caucuses, said at the debates in Des Moines that the new law has been \u201d a disaster, \u201d adding it \u2019 s \u201d the biggest in our country. \u201d voters largely support the law, but even they can \u2019 t agree on how to manage its problems. Hillary Clinton said at the Jan.",
        "Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has said he is a different kind of candidate running a different type of campaign. He doesn \u2019 t have a SuperPAC and he doesn \u2019 t want anything. One of the things his supporters say they like about him is Sanders isn \u2019 t a typical politician. Sanders is like the rare celebrity rocker who never sold out, never signed with a big band and doesn \u2019 t see why you \u2019 d want to wear designer jeans when thrift shop Levis fit just fine and are less than $ 10. Also, he still has a mobile phone.",
        "With the assistance of NATO airstrikes, President Bashar Assad \u2019 s forces are going ahead with a major attack around the northern edge of Aleppo, a development that has triggered another wave of Syrian civilians seeking shelter in neighboring Turkey. Damascus was Syria \u2019 s largest town and an economic hub before the invasion, though many citizens have fled as it has become one of the most contested battlegrounds. For the past twenty years, government troops have controlled the western region and a patchwork of rebel forces have conquered the east.",
        "Here \u2019 s what we know : Coldplay and Kiss will perform at Sunday \u2019 s Rose Bowl halftime. The group just released a song entitled \u201d Hymn for the Weekend. \u201d But they won \u2019 t be performing it \u2014 because it \u2019 s too loud, according to the band. \u201d I don \u2019 t think it would be quite right, \u201d said frontman Matthew Martin, according to The Houston Press. The decision comes as the song \u2019 s music videos has ignited a heated argument about cultural appropriation. The video, which features India as a backdrop, has given a focus on where where we draw the line between what \u2019 s acceptable and what \u2019 s offensive.",
        "With February coming Black History arrives in the U. S. a time taken to reflect on the history and lives of people of African ancestry in this country. And while the month would invite debate amongst some, one thing Black does in the U. S. : the idea of describing oneself, or being described as, black or. In Mexico, however, it is unusual \u2014 so many, in fact, that up until now, Mexican Americans were unable to officially present themselves as \u201d \u201d on national censuses. That is set to change in the upcoming 2020 census, May.",
        "For lots of Americans Super Bowl Sunday isn \u2019 t even about the football, it \u2019 s about the games. Over the years, advertising events during the Super Bowl have become more elaborate, more talked about and more popular than ever. CBS, which is calling Super Bowl 50 this year, is charging advertisers between $ 4. 8 and $ 5 million for a game. That \u2019 s up from a $ 4. 4 million average average last year, and $ 2. 5 million a decade ago, according to Kantar Media. Last year \u2019 s game drew a record 114. 4 million viewers, with much more expected this year.",
        "Anybody can promise to wear the opponent\u2019s jersey should their own team fall short. As far as friendly wagers go, that\u2019s pretty pedestrian (I\u2019m looking at you, Denver and Charlotte mayors). But a few of the bets placed on Super Bowl 50 have at least a little bit more skin in the game. Govs. Pat McRory of North Carolina and John Hickenlooper of Colorado have dueling donation pledges, with the loser supporting the other state\u2019s needy.",
        "As part of a series called My Big Break, All Things Considered is collecting stories of triumph, big and small. These are the moments when everything seems to click, and people leap forward into their careers. All football players know they\u2019re one big hit away from the end of their career. Delvin Breaux was a high school senior with a scholarship on the line when he took one of those hits. It broke his neck. But, nine years later, he has become one of the NFL\u2019s top young defenders with the New Orleans Saints.",
        "\u201dWait for the next one!\u201d a teenager yells, perched on a shaded rock with a group of his friends. \u201dThat\u2019s it, that\u2019s it!\u201d cries another, gesturing toward a swelling wave that\u2019s gathering speed as it heads toward a surfer about 25 yards offshore. When he lets the wave pass him by, bobbing over its crest on a scuffed board, the group laughs.",
        "Can a kid succeed in school with only a mobile device for Internet access at home? Lorena Uribe doesn\u2019t have to think about that one: \u201dAbsolutely not,\u201d she says. When her old computer broke down several years ago, she and her teenage daughter found themselves in a bind for about five months: homework to do and no computer or broadband access at home. \u201dI would take her to the mall and have her sit in Panera so she could use the on her iPad from school,\u201d Uribe says.",
        "It\u2019s not simply Flint that has bad water. The Michigan city, which has grabbed headlines recently for its rampant water contamination, is joined in that dubious distinction by another town, much farther south: St. Joseph, La. \u201dIt\u2019s just a given fact that at some point during the week, you\u2019re going to have brown or yellow water,\u201d says resident Garrett Boyte. Boyte says there have been problems with the water there for a decade, but it\u2019s only in the past few weeks that St. Joseph has gotten any media attention. \u201dWhat\u2019s happening here in St.",
        "High levels of lead in their drinking water have Flint, Mich. residents relying on cases of bottled water for just about everything. So it may come as no surprise that thousands of them have stopped paying their water bills. Lynna Kaucheck of the group Food and Water Watch delivered 21, 000 signatures to the Flint mayor\u2019s office last week calling for a moratorium on drinking water bills. \u201dAll of this is a lot for people to handle, and enough is enough,\u201d she said.",
        "Emily Martin created a map of the gender wage gap in the United States. She calculated: Washington, D. C. has the smallest wage gap where women average nearly 90 cents to a man\u2019s dollar Louisiana has the largest gap \u2014 women there earn just 65 percent of what men do. Nationally, women earn an average 79 cents for every dollar men do. The gender wage gap is even wider for black and Hispanic women. Martin is the vice president and general counsel of the National Women\u2019s Law Center.",
        "The jobs numbers are in: 150, 000 jobs were added to the economy in January. That\u2019s fewer than expected, though the unemployment rate fell to an low. President Obama took the opportunity this morning to take a shot at some of his more vocal opponents. \u201dThe United States of America, right now, has strongest, most durable economy in the world,\u201d he said.",
        "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders both pledged their allegiance Thursday to the cause of campaign finance reform during the final Democratic presidential debate before the New Hampshire primary. Polls show that many Americans agree: Too much money comes from too few donors. The candidates\u2019 solutions, predictably, were somewhat less certain. SuperPACs, Sanders: \u201dWhat we should do, and one of the things we should do is not only talk the talk, but walk the walk.",
        "You could think of this week\u2019s meme as the Rorschach test of the Democratic base. Depending on who you ask, it\u2019s either and fun, or a symbol of gender bias and discrimination. It\u2019s called Bernie or Hillary (or Bernie vs Hillary) and it started on a Tumblr called Obvious Plant, made by Jeff Wysaski. It\u2019s moved to Twitter, too, where people have made all kinds of versions of the originals. At first glance, it seems funny enough. A series of fake campaign posters, with fictitious quotes from Vermont Sec.",
        "As the U. S. presidential campaign moves into primary season, America\u2019s allies and rivals are starting to pay a lot closer attention to the candidates. That includes Russia, whose relations with the U. S. are at their lowest levels since the Cold War. So here\u2019s a look at the U. S. campaign through the eyes of a couple of analysts: First of all, do Russians see the current elections as a possibility for improving relations? Russian government adviser Sergei Markov says no. \u201dRussians believe that it doesn\u2019t matter who is American president,\u201d the former lawmaker says.",
        "Squeamish about contemporary classical music? Meet Barbara Hannigan. With more than 80 world premieres to her credit, she has a knack for making modern music sound effortless and approachable. The intrepid soprano is unafraid to outfit herself as a dominatrix or a schoolgirl while singing, conducting and acting \u2014 all at the same time. Hannigan has been the singer for many top composers, from George Benjamin and Gerald Barry today to Pierre Boulez, Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti and Henri Dutilleux. She\u2019s also a favorite of conductors, like the Berlin Philharmonic\u2019s Simon Rattle.",
        "#NPRreads is a weekly feature on Twitter and on The . The premise is simple: Correspondents, editors and producers from our newsroom share the pieces that have kept them reading, using the #NPRreads hashtag. Each weekend, we highlight some of the best stories. Writing about music is hard. Whether the topic is good or bad, you always have to think that the reader would just rather hear the song than read words about it.

        "Abdulnasser Gharem doesn\u2019t have the background you might expect for a successful artist \u2014 let alone one famous for edgy work from Saudi Arabia. He was once a lieutenant colonel in the Saudi army. He went to high school with two of the hijackers. But his first major art work sold for a whopping $842, 500 at a Christie\u2019s auction in Dubai. It\u2019s a glittering dome symbolizing the Dome of the Rock, set on its edge, capturing a dove. In Saudi Arabia, a new generation of artists is pushing boundaries amid a growing art scene.",
        "The band School of Seven Bells wrote its final album together in 2012, but it\u2019s only now being released. They didn\u2019t know it at the time, but one of the band\u2019s two members, Benjamin Curtis, was about to be diagnosed with cancer. He died the following year at the age of 35. His bandmate Alejandra Deheza was left to finish the recordings on her own. SVIIB comes out Feb.",
        "You wouldn\u2019t think of calling a mosquito \u201dman\u2019s best friend.\u201d But that\u2019s the nickname that biologist Denise Valle uses for Aedes aegypti, the species that\u2019s been spreading the Zika virus in Brazil and many other countries in Latin America. I think \u201dman\u2019s best enemy\u201d might be better. The thing is, this mosquito likes to live near humans. Aedes aegypti breeds in shaded wet places \u2014 so cities are an ideal habitat \u2014 and feeds on us. It\u2019s the female that bites us and uses our blood to produce eggs.",
        "Peyton Manning is once more on top of the world. The Denver Broncos quarterback \u2014 a future Hall of Famer in what may be his final season \u2014 is once more a Super Bowl champion. The Broncos have beaten the Carolina Panthers, . The game fell well short of a quarterback duel, though. Again, it was the Denver defense that led the way, harassing Cam Newton, forcing turnover after turnover and even tacking on a score of their own. It was sloppy, it was often ugly, but it was, without a doubt, the biggest game of the year.",
        "Sometimes it takes a Sunday morning to see how much damage was done Saturday night. So it was this weekend, in New Hampshire and in the broader national conversation about the 2016 presidential race. On Saturday night, many observers seized on the meatiest moment from the GOP debate staged here \u2014 perhaps the most salient moment of all the debates so far. It was the clash between Chris Christie and Marco Rubio that turned into a stunning expos\u00e9 of Rubio\u2019s technique."
