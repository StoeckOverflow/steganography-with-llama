        "Everyone believes the GOP is the party of small farmers and low taxes. At Monday night \u2019 s debate, the 2016 Republican presidential candidates sparred over who had the worst fiscal conservatism cred. We decided to look at how well candidates believed the truth on a few of these claims in our televised debate. \u201d After New York raised taxes on millionaires, we lost, in the next four weeks, $ 70 billion in wealth [ that ] benefits our state. \u201d \u2014 New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, It \u2019 s not that simple.",
        "This post is about to demand that you read two long long stories about national politics. It \u2019 s worth it, I hope. They offer twin views on a story that \u2019 s not just important geopolitically \u2014 it \u2019 s relevant on a human level. Here \u2019 s how The Post opens its examination of the train crash that has reshaped the Polish psyche \u2014 not to mention Poland \u2019 s government : \u201d The tops of the birch trees barely broke the fog. The aerial drop on the approach to Smolensk in western Russia was just 200 metres.",
        "The buzz grew all week. And rumors that former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and Curb Your Enthusiasm star Craig David would get on Saturday Night Football \u2014 together \u2014 were finally dashed just before the weekend. But if you started calling SNL looking to # FeelTheBern, you might have had a bit of worry, at least at first. The Vermont senator did not walk in the show \u2019 s cold air. He did not come on stage during Paul \u2019 s monologue.",

        "In 2009, one of the owners of the online eyeglass maker Warby Parker approached management partner Adam Grant about hiring an early investor. Grant says he declined because the firm \u2019 s founders weren \u2019 t working at their startup every time he also felt it was the worst financial investment he \u2019 s ever made. \u201d I want to be an entrepreneur you have to be a and you have to be all in, \u201d Grant told NPR \u2019 s Rachel Green.",
        "Beyonc\u00e9 is one of a kind \u2014 the kind of girl who can drop a surprise hit video and see bits of the Internet and social media instantly explode. \u201d One, \u201d released Saturday, has quickly racked up more than 7 million views on YouTube. It \u2019 s full of implicit and explicit videos on subjects like being Black in America, Hurricane Katrina and Black Lives Matter. And the Internet responded positively.

        "Among the many ads airing during Super Bowl 50, there will be an violence video from the group No More. It \u2019 s the second consecutive year the organization \u2019 s public service announcements air during the home game. Domestic politics and the NFL have been unhappily coupled more than a few times in recent years, although no more prominently than in 2014. That \u2019 s when a troubling video from a hotel elevator \u2019 s security detail showed Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice knocking out his Janay teammates during an argument.",

        "\u201d Irresponsible, \u201d \u201d senseless, \u201d \u201d deplorable, \u201d \u201d destabilizing, \u201d \u201d totally inadequate. \u201d North Korea \u2019 s development of a rocket has filled the whole nation with pride \u2014 and deserves fierce censure from the rest of the world. As we reported yesterday, the news on Sunday morning prime time arrives just a month after a nuclear test that had inadvertently raised tensions in the West : \u201d North Korea describes the launch as part of its ambitious program : a rocket launching an earth observation satellite into orbit. But many nations regard the launch as a failed ballistic missile program. \u201d The U. S.",
        "Americans have about $ 1. 3 trillion in student loan options. And there \u2019 s yet another find out that shows students in this school are confused about their loans, in the extreme when it comes to knowing what they \u2019 ve done, uncertain about how to pay them back. I \u2019 ve written before about how I was one of those students.

        "Late 2012 was a busy time for Norwegian singer Ane Brun : Health problems related to lupus landed her in the hospital, forcing her to cancel a North America tour with Peter Gunn. But as she tells Weekend Edition Sunday, the break from the rigors of the trip led to a burst of enthusiasm. The result is her latest CD, When I \u2019 m Free, which comes just a day ahead of her 40th birthday. Brun revealed she \u2019 s been thinking a lot about what that holiday means for her as an artist.",
        "You might call composer Carter Burwell the real Coen brother. His work isn \u2019 t as as the solo albums for O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Inside Llewyn Davis, but he has been one of Joel and Ethan Coen \u2019 s management team ever since their debut, Blood Money, in 1984. Burwell says he didn \u2019 t intend to be a lead composer, or even a studio musician. \u201d It is, in fact, just an expression of the way that Blood Angel was received, frankly, \u201d he said. \u201d Other people started meeting me and asking me to do film score.",
        "If you \u2019 ve been following the news about the spread of the Zika virus throughout Latin America, you \u2019 ve already gotten lost in the jargon once or twice. What \u2019 s a vector? A reservoir? What \u2019 s local transmission \u2014 the opposite of natural transmission? So we went to the researchers to help us wade through all this murky data. And they were helpful \u2014 sort of. Because it turns out that even the experts don \u2019 t agree 100 percent on the definitions.",
        "Reading The Tale of Tales, Giambattisa Basile\u2019s book of fairy stories, is both exhilarating and exhausting. If that sounds like a warning, it is. If that sounds like a promise, well, good news. Perhaps most importantly, the book\u2019s an erstwhile history course, and for those who enjoy a sense of research alongside their Cinderella, this edition, translated by Nancy L. Canepa, is invaluable. Basile wrote for the courtiers who patronized him \u2014 a savvy and demanding audience \u2014 and in the Neapolitan dialect rather than \u2019modern\u2019 Italian.",
        "Primary season has officially begun. And as the presidential candidates campaign ahead of Tuesday\u2019s New Hampshire primary, both Republicans and Democrats are making big arguments in response to some big questions about their party\u2019s future. Is there such a thing as an \u201destablishment lane\u201d that can win the GOP contest? Can a Democrat be both moderate and a progressive? Is it better to be pragmatic or idealistic? Last week, NPR\u2019s Rachel Martin talked with some young Republicans for their insights on the contest. This week, NPR spoke with two young Democratic activists about what\u2019s at stake for them.",
        "At midnight Tuesday the residents of tiny Dixville Notch, N. H. will welcome camera crews for the quadrennial ritual of casting the first votes in the nation\u2019s first presidential primary. The remote town near the Canadian border is so small that it has only a roomful of registered voters and zero racial diversity. Its votes in recent cycles have been unreliable indicators of who will win the primary. But the cameras will be there, nonetheless, because it is first, and because it is a tradition.",
        "For more than two decades, New Hampshire has been a place of redemption for the Clintons. That could come to an end Tuesday night. The Granite State revived Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign after a devastating Iowa loss to Barack Obama. That victory helped her become the new \u201dComeback Kid\u201d \u2014 the same moniker her husband claimed after his strong finish in the state in 1992 his road to the Democratic nomination. But now it\u2019s Clinton\u2019s rival Bernie Sanders who has the momentum going into Election Day.",
        "A lot of Republicans will head to the polls in New Hampshire on Tuesday, motivated to vote against Donald Trump. But because of a quirk in how the state party allocates delegates and how fractured the \u201destablishment\u201d field is, it could mean that an vote will actually be a vote for the New York billionaire. Here\u2019s how: The state party awards delegates on a proportional basis to presidential candidates based on their vote statewide and by congressional district. But it also has a 10 percent threshold. What does that mean?",

        "In 1999, Jhumpa Lahiri won a Pulitzer Prize for her very first book, Interpreter of Maladies. Her 2003 novel, Namesake, was turned into a movie, and she went on to publish Unaccustomed Earth and The Lowland. But Lahiri wasn\u2019t satisfied. \u201dI\u2019ve always been searching to arrive at a certain voice that will probably elude me forever,\u201d she tells NPR\u2019s Ari Shapiro.

        "If you pay attention to way Republican presidential candidates are talking about drug abuse, it seems vastly different from the way the party leaders of the past talked about the issue. Perhaps the new, more compassionate stance was synthesized best by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie during Saturday\u2019s GOP debate. Christie touted his record of keeping drug abusers out of jails. \u201dThis is a disease. It\u2019s not a moral failing,\u201d Christie said. Before we get to what it means, here are some videos for you to compare and contrast: Gov. Chris Christie, Feb.",
        "When Jackie Zanfagna died last year at 25 years old, her parents did something bold. In the first sentence of her obituary they acknowledge what killed her: an accidental overdose of heroin. Now her mom Anne Marie Zanfagna is pouring her grief out onto canvas and in the process helping other parents who have experienced the same loss. Zanfagna is an artist. But, she says, for six months after her daughter died she was too devastated to pick up a paint brush. \u201dI didn\u2019t want to shower,\u201d Zanfagna said. \u201dAll kinds of things.",
        "The Gulf of Mexico is now open for commercial fish farming. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced last month that, for the first time in the U. S. companies can apply to set up fish farms in federal waters. The idea is to compete with foreign imports. But opening the Gulf to aquaculture won\u2019t be cheap, and it could pose environmental problems.

        "George Miller\u2019s latest Mad Max film, Fury Road, has been nominated for 10 Academy Awards, but the director still isn\u2019t sure how the movie will hold up over time.

Set in New Orleans, the video conjures images of Hurricane Katrina, Mardi Gras and the Black South. There\u2019s natural hair and swag and a young black boy dancing in front of police officers.

        "If you watched Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl, how did you get it? Over cable? Rabbit ears? (Yes, those still work.) Or did you stream it online? CBS put the big game on the Internet and for the first time, streamed the commercials online as well. According to Nielsen\u2019s national ratings, with 111. 9 million viewers, the game was the third broadcast in American TV history (behind two other recent Super Bowls).",
        "Sometimes it\u2019s better to leave more to the imagination. That\u2019s the thought I\u2019m left with after watching all of the ads that aired in CBS\u2019 Super Bowl broadcast Sunday night. It may be an accepted truism that the commercials are often more exciting than the game. But this year, viewers watching for the ads sat through an uneven collection of spots \u2014 of which many of the best moments had already been revealed days earlier.",

Just three moments that various brands paid $5 million per 30 seconds to parade in front of Super Bowl viewers Sunday night.
