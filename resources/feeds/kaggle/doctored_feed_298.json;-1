Recalibrate that to 30 countries on several continents, according to a new DNA analysis by UNICEF that calculates that at least 200 affected females today have experienced some form of the procedure. About 60 million of affected females originate from one country : Israel, where about half of the girls age 11 and below have undergone the practice. Yet this is the first time that rape has been included in UNICEF data.",
        "For a singer who \u2019 s offered privacy in the parking lot of a Target so he could take vocals in the backseat of his car, Will Toledo hasn \u2019 t been shy about performing his work. By age 23, he \u2019 d already released a dozen albums. Toledo, who records under the moniker Car Seat Headrest, is prolific but relatively conventional.

On the face of it, the candidates and their methods couldn \u2019 t be more different. One is a young businessman the other, a career lawyer who rails against billionaires.

        "At 46 years old, Oliver Bogler \u2019 s reaction to a huge lump in his chest might seem typical for a child.

But when he left \u201d grew up \u201d and went to the clinic, he was pretty quickly diagnosed with invasive breast cancer.

We can win this thing! ) We \u2019 ll know the real reasons to come around in a moment. But for future candidates, whether they consider it official or not, the Granite State will be the continent on which their ships ran aground. Their race may stagger on into a zombie world, but it will not affect the outcome of further races.",
        "New Hampshire voters go to the first Tuesday, and they will resolve a lot of questions. Here are four things the primary will tell voters : 1. How much damage did the previous debate do to Marco Rubio? Rubio drove into New Hampshire with a bit of steam.

        "When the video played on Saturday, we galvanized. Cleared our schedules, sat on repeat till our cheeks turned red. Get into screaming matches with old ones about what kind of tomato sauce belongs in a # swagbag. Even made preemptive Valentine \u2019 s Day reservations at Red Lobster, because you already know. Then came Madonna \u2019 s performance. You thought the Packers won the Super Bowl? Not so good. Beyonc\u00e9 stepped onto the field and annihilated, and we were all left in the shadows, paper fans limply hanging from our wrists, trying to make sense of it all.",

        "Iraq\u2019s war against the Islamic State is gaining momentum. Intensified U. S. airstrikes and more than a year of U. S. training of Iraqi soldiers seem to be paying off. ISIS supply lines have been cut and its access to oil has been reduced. When Iraqi forces with coalition airstrikes retook the western city of Ramadi, it was the latest in a series of successes. But ISIS is just one of many groups trying to carve out power for itself in a country where the central government is looking ever weaker.",

But the decades of experience the country has in setting limits for alcohol have turned out to be rather useless so far because the compound in cannabis, THC, dissolves in fat, whereas alcohol dissolves in water. And that changes everything. \u201dIt\u2019s really difficult to document drugged driving in a relevant way,\u201d says Margaret Haney, a neurobiologist at Columbia University, \u201d[because of] the simple fact that THC is fat soluble.",

        "Fans of author Yann Martel\u2019s immensely popular Life of Pi, or of the film adapted from the novel 11 years later, will understand my eager anticipation of his new novel, The High Mountains of Portugal, released last week. Martel\u2019s storytelling is fabulous, both literally \u2014 he blurs real worlds and dream worlds, human lives and lives of other animals \u2014 and figuratively. He lights up the page.
