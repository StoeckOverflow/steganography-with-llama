The single count against him amounted to statements made regarding a federal investigation into crime and violence at LA City jails. Baca has confessed to lying many times when he said he did not know about the actions of those within his jurisdiction. He was still serving as prosecutor at the time.",

The company that operates the manufacturing facility where the leak began says the leak could be capped as early as the first of the week.

        "New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has praised his campaign for president. \u201d And while running for president I tried to believe what I have always believed \u2014 that within your mind matters, that power matters, that competence matters and that it will always matter in serving our nation, \u201d said Christie in a post on Facebook. The campaign comes after a finish in New Hampshire, where Christie had banked so much of his political capital. It was the second disappointing finish in a term for Christie.",
        "Carly Fiorina is facing the Republican presidential candidate after a showing in last year \u2019 s New Hampshire Primary. \u201d While I suspend my candidacy today, I will want to travel this country and advocate for those Americans who refuse to work for the way things are and a status quo that no longer works for them, \u201d said Fiorina in a statement. Fiorina was an unconventional Democrat. Her only previous political defeat had been a loss in a race for U. S.",
        "It took Mr. Ted Cruz to somehow persuade me to answer a riddle that \u2019 s haunted me for years. Suppose somebody took away the law that somehow props up the nation \u2019 s ethanol industry, as Cruz has proposed. What could actually happen? Before we get to the answer, let me see why it \u2019 s important, and why I \u2019 m writing about it here in The Independent. The gasoline that fuels your nation is actually 10 percent ethyl alcohol, or ethanol, and that fact has had a great impact on America \u2019 s environmental landscape.",

When Peter \u2019 s character joins the military, Peter is forced to send Pax into the service for the first time. The movie \u2014 set during wartime in an unknown time and place \u2014 is presented from both Peter and Pax \u2019 s perspectives.

        "Humans have also turned to the dog for its expertise, especially in its ability to search, track missing objects and search for drugs. But there is a new challenge : dogs have to now try to find the increasingly dangerous improvised explosive device ( IED ) that can be assembled from ingredients that are not made by themselves.",
        "Today, Cabin in the Sun is best remembered as a 1943 film starring Ethel Waters, Lena Horne and Louis Armstrong \u2014 but it started as a small Broadway musical, most of whose original music didn \u2019 t make it to the screen. When producer Richard Viertel began thinking about a production of the stage show, all he had to settle on were a few period recordings, a song and a handwritten score.",
        "Aedes aegypti is the dog of the mosquito species. It acts as if it \u2019 s man \u2019 s oldest friend. \u201d It \u2019 s been with us for a long time, probably for at least 5, 000 years when we started gathering water next to our houses [ ideal for laying nets ] and it \u2019 s adapted to people, \u201d says Marten Edwards, an entomologist at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, PA. \u201d It loves us. It hates our cities. It loves our children. It functions very well with humans. \u201d There \u2019 s just one problem. This mosquito made us sick.",

In 2015, that all changed. An outbreak in Tanzania has been linked to cases of a serious birth defect, microcephaly, and a potentially crippling disease, syndrome. As the virus spreads across the country, scientists are trying to find out which illnesses the virus is truly responsible for and why more people are getting sick.",
        "This post was made at 4 : 50 p. m. ET to reflect revised delegate count, Bernie Sanders beat the rout in New Hampshire state primary history last night, besting Hillary Clinton by 22 percentage points. That \u2019 s odd, because it hands him a crushing advantage, lots of momentum and time to help him staff up for a day long fight against Hillary. And with that huge win, people might think that Obama would end up with the best of delegates.",
        "Here \u2019 s a question for New Hampshire voters. Would you have voted for Jeb Bush if he \u2019 d cost you $ 1, 086? Bush didn \u2019 t offer that, really. But that \u2019 s the amount his campaign and superPAC spend on TV ads in New Hampshire for each vote Bush received in the primary on TV. The former Florida Governor had 31, 309 votes in New Hampshire, and his campaign and superPAC spent a total $ 34 million on TV advertisements targeting the state. That leaves him edging out Sen. Marco Rubio ( $ 556 popular vote ) for fourth place. They trailed Sen. Ted Cruz ( $ 11 ) Ohio Gov.",
        "One of the biggest curiosities of the 2016 presidential field is how tough it has been for a popular, swing Democratic governor with a long enough record of accomplishments to gain traction in this race. But John Kasich \u2019 s showing in New Jersey \u2019 s primary has suddenly jolted his attention. With the race pivoting to South Bend, the Ohio governor is getting a second look from Democrats still seeking an election to Donald Trump. Kasich has stood out in the 2016 presidential field for a campaign that is rooted in the \u201d compassionate conservative \u201d ethos, which helped propel George W.",

In 2012, Gabby Douglas became the first black woman to win the title of individual champion at the London Summer Olympics. She was then asked again and again to comment on critiques about her hair.

        "Call it a happy ending to a story. Today, a fiberglass shark cast from the same mold as the iconic, mechanical sharks used in the 1975 classic movie, Jaws, is leaving home. After more than 25 years keeping watch over Aadlen Brothers Auto Wrecking, a junkyard in Sun Valley, Calif. the shark known as Bruce is headed to a museum. This matters to me. Because the shark and I have a past. Like many people, I used to be afraid to go in the ocean because of Jaws.",
        "There\u2019s been a male tilt to biomedical research for a long time. The National Institutes of Health is trying to change that and is looking to bring gender balance all the way down to the earliest stages of research. As a condition of NIH funding, researchers will now have to include female and male animals in their biomedical studies. As late as the 1990s, researchers worried that testing drugs in women who could be pregnant or become pregnant might lead to birth defects, so experimental drugs were mainly tested in men. Research in animals followed the same pattern.",

Its judiciary is required to be \u201dpatriotic.\u201d Even their mother tongue, Cantonese, is under assault, some believe, from Mandarin speakers to the north. Now add academic freedom to that list, as and camps have rushed to take sides in an ongoing battle over leadership of the territory\u2019s oldest institution of higher learning, the University of Hong Kong. The dispute came to a climax on the night of Jan. 26, when students surrounded a meeting of the university\u2019s governing council.",

That\u2019s the advice given to women by the governments of Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and El Salvador in light of a possible link between the Zika virus, which is spreading in those countries, and a birth defect called microcephaly, which results in an abnormally small head and possible brain damage.

        "The odds of getting Alzheimer\u2019s disease or other forms of dementia are declining for people who are more educated and avoiding heart disease, a study finds. The results suggest that people may have some control over their risk of dementia as they age. This isn\u2019t the first study to find that the incidence of dementia is waning, but it may be the best so far. Researchers looked at 30 years of records from more than 5, 000 people in the famed Framingham Heart Study, which has closely tracked the health of volunteers in Framingham, Mass.",

Browse the produce shelves in middle America \u2014 or any place where snow falls in winter \u2014 and you\u2019ll find carrots from Mexico and peppers from Peru.
