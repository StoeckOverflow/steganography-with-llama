        "On Feb. 10, 2015, Amy Hamad remembers sitting in her dorm room in Raleigh, N. C. It was late, a sort of humdrum night when the phone rang. It was her oldest daughter. \u201d Yes, \u201d she said, her voice hoarse. \u201d Deah \u2019 s dead. \u201d Hamad \u2019 s face turned white. She had just seen Deah Barakat, a with an encouraging smile and calming accent, at a community fundraiser not too long before. She kept pointing at him, jokingly telling her daughter, Marjan, that he \u2019 s cute. \u201d He \u2019 s taken, Mama, \u201d she responded.",
        "Marvel \u2019 s first superhero movie Deadpool starred Ryan Reynolds, a fact that, up to now, would likely not have been considered much of a selling point. This is not, after all, Reynolds \u2019 first movie as a superhero. There was that catastrophic Green Lantern movie, his favorite supersnail in Turbo, and he played this character very briefly in what \u2019 s arguably the worst of the movies.",
        "Far from our planet, in the vast darkness of space, two massive dark holes merged into a single, larger hole. And now people say they have detected rumblings from that cataclysmic source as ripples in the very fabric of itself. The discovery began a century after Albert Einstein first predicted such ripples should arise. \u201d It \u2019 s a really big hole, \u201d says Saul Teukolsky, a senior astrophysicist at Cornell University.",
        "I wrote this with the promise that today, Thursday, Nov. 11, 2016, the biggest science discovery since the discovery of the Higgs sphere would be all over the news. With that in mind, please allow me to recount my own life history that led to this announcement : I think you get the point. All my professional life I have been engaged in scientific talks about detecting \u2014 particles \u201d seeing \u201d \u2014 the vibrations of space and something called gravitational radiation. At some point, after all those years, I began to think : \u201d Hey, obviously this isn \u2019 t going to work.",
        "A federal grand jury is said to have finished hearing evidence in the death of Eric Garner, an unidentified black man who escaped after he was placed in a chokehold by a white police officer, NPR \u2019 s David Rose reports, though two sources involved with the investigation. The grand jury is determining whether Judge Daniel Pantaleo violated Garner \u2019 s civil rights as he sought to arrest him for allegedly smoking loose cigarettes. If you wish, a New York grand jury declined to dismiss charges against Pantaleo back in court.",
        "In the summer of 2014, a pregnant woman entered the primary hospital at Bagram Air Field in Afghanistan with a cut on her left cheek. The wound had been stitched up somehow, but she still wasn \u2019 t quite healing. She said she \u2019 d been hit in the face by a ricochet back in her home base. What hit her exactly, she couldn \u2019 t say for sure. She was upset, however, because the vision was bad in her left eye, even though there had been no apparent trauma to it.",
        "After a victory in the Minnesota caucuses, and a loss to Bernie Sanders in the New Hampshire caucus, Hillary Clinton is headed to South Carolina for a clear win later this season. And she \u2019 s counting on strong popular support in that state to grant her a definitive victory. Most commentators suggest she \u2019 ll get that support by some estimates, she could garner 80 percent of South Carolina \u2019 s primary vote in the Feb. 27 elections. Previously, even George Sanders himself admitted as governor. But there may be a hitch. Increasingly, young, elderly voters are turning lukewarm on Obama.",
        "The morning after his New Hampshire primary win, Bernie Sanders paid a highly publicized visit to Connecticut to dine with Al Sharpton, one of Iowa \u2019 s most prominent civil rights activists and media personalities. The two dined at Sylvia \u2019 s, the same New York City cafe where Sharpton huddled with Barack Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign. Bernie \u2019 s meeting was a recognition of Sanders \u2019 pivot to South Carolina and Sanders \u2019 effort to broaden his appeal to the nation \u2019 s decisive voters.",
        "Multitasking is a myth, said Daniel Levitin. This was the premise underlying the first of the tasks suggested by WNYC \u2019 s Note to Self Defense. I had signed up for their set of tasks in hopes of decluttering my brain of the uselessly appealing Internet detritus to get a boost of creative energy. And now my main elimination target was multitasking. Levitin is a neuroscientist. He should work. But it \u2019 s 8 : 30 a. m. and I \u2019 ve got 16 Internet tabs on my phone, three more tabs on my phone, eight opened emails, a missed phone call and a scrolling text timeline.",
        "Sure, people fight about superhero movies and movies and who was the best James Bond. But if you want to break some deeply felt opinions, get in a fight about good comedies. Or, if you don \u2019 t care to, just ignore this Twitter debate I had a couple of weeks ago with author and comedian Kumail Nanjiani, who has almost as deep opinions about such things as I do. ( Almost.",
        "Tiny birds have started hatching this week at the San Diego Zoo, and kids there are celebrating the arrival of new tree lobsters. It \u2019 s all part of a fundraising effort for the Lord Byron Island stick show. The huge, black, muscular creature, also known as a tree lobster, is a superstar of the entomological world, because its life is such a strange saga of joy and commitment. \u201d It \u2019 s a very emotional thing about an animal that most people don \u2019 t feel emotional about, \u201d says David Howorth, the San Diego zoo \u2019 s curator of entomology.",
        "No, this isn \u2019 t a place. It \u2019 s real. They call it \u201d Ball \u2019 s Bluff. \u201d It \u2019 s what \u2019 s left of an old lighthouse that emerged from the sea about 7 thousand years ago. A British naval officer called Ball was the first man to see it in 1788. It sits off Hawaii, in the South Pacific. It is quite narrow, 1, 844 feet across, and it sits alone. What \u2019 s more, for centuries this place had a secret.",
        "The Justice Department slapped the city of Albany, Mo. with a civil action lawsuit this week after the city Council voted to drop a proposed settlement deal to reform the police and firefighters. When Attorney General Loretta Young announced the suit on Twitter, she said Ferguson police disproportionately targeted black activists for traffic stops, abuse of force and jail time. \u201d These violations were not only egregious, they were routine, \u201d Lynch said. \u201d They were encouraged by the police in the interest of raising awareness.",
        "As the Republican primary moves to South Carolina, political observers are predicting that the race could get nasty in the state that historically plays a major role in choosing the party\u2019s nominee. \u201dSouth Carolina is brutal. It\u2019s . It is the toughest of tough political environments to play in,\u201d says Hogan Gidley, a former director of the South Carolina Republican Party. South Carolina was put on the map as an important presidential primary by Lee Atwater, a famously ruthless GOP operative.",
        "Chances are you\u2019ve heard at least one song written by Diane Warren: \u201dRhythm of the Night,\u201d \u201dDon\u2019t Turn Around,\u201d \u201dUnbreak My Heart\u201d and \u201dIf I Could Turn Back Time\u201d are just a handful of her 70 or so Top 10 hits. Warren has penned hundreds of heartbreaking songs about intimacy and romance for Whitney Houston, Elton John, Rod Stewart, Gloria Estefan and many, many more. But she\u2019s long sworn that she does not do romance in real life.",
        "On Thursday, researchers announced the discovery of gravitational waves \u2014 wrinkles in the very fabric of . But behind the headlines and news conferences were decades of hard work, hundreds of scientists and more than a billion dollars in taxpayer funds. \u201dIt\u2019s profoundly satisfying that it came out the way that we intended, we\u2019d hoped, we\u2019d dreamed,\u201d says Kip Thorne, a gravitational theorist at Caltech who the project.",
        "I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s ever been a record release as confounding as the one for Kanye West\u2019s The Life Of Pablo. He\u2019s changed its title and track listing several times in as many weeks, and even up until the very moment I\u2019m writing this, it\u2019s not 100 percent certain what will be on that final album, whenever and wherever it comes out.",
        "Tell her how you really feel: Dr. Julie Holland is asking women to embrace their inner \u201dmoody bitches.\u201d Let me back up. The psychiatrist has noticed a shift in her female patients.",
        "Jim Gilmore\u2019s quixotic presidential campaign came to a surreptitious end Friday. His resume reads like someone who should have been a candidate \u2014 former governor of Virginia, a former Republican National Committee chairman, and the only military veteran in a primary campaign where national security is a top concern among voters. Instead, Gilmore got just 12 votes in Iowa. In New Hampshire \u2014 the state where he repeatedly said would really begin his campaign \u2014 he ended up with only 134 votes.",
        "On Sunday, John Oliver returns to HBO with the latest season of Last Week Tonight. The satirical current events show doesn\u2019t shy away from complex topics \u2014 drones, net neutrality, the NSA Oliver even landed an interview with Edward Snowden last year. Facts are always the backbone of the show, Oliver tells NPR\u2019s Kelly McEvers. After sorting through lots of pitches, stories are aggressively researched. \u201dYou can\u2019t build jokes on sand,\u201d Oliver says. \u201dYou can\u2019t be wrong about something \u2014 otherwise that joke just disintegrates. . ..",

        "One of the world\u2019s most famous and oldest spacecraft is revealing some of its past. Apollo 11 was the first mission to land humans on the moon. As Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the lunar surface, Michael Collins circled above in the command module called Columbia. Columbia is where the three astronauts lived during most of the mission in July 1969. It\u2019s the only part of the spacecraft that returned to Earth, and it\u2019s been at the Smithsonian since 1970 and at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D. C. since it opened in 1976.",
        "In India, Facebook has a program to give people free Internet access \u2014 just to use Facebook and a handful of other services.

        "A candlelit dinner, a bottle of bubbly Champagne and a beautiful date. You tear your gaze away for a second to glance at the check your waiter just gave you. Your heart skips a beat at the sight of the number. But never mind, the stunning smile across the table is worth it. Right? Relationships come with sweet romance and accelerating heartbeats, but money, unfortunately, is often a crucial ingredient in the mix as well. Think about it: Weekly date nights, vacations, wedding, honeymoon and even divorce ring up bills of all sorts.",
        "Like many romance readers, I have a list of authors whose new releases are always on my shopping list. But this winter I\u2019ve been looking for new (to me) novels that reflect the people I see around me. I wanted to read books by authors of color. I also looked for interracial relationships, protagonists from different cultures, and class differences without power imbalances (the Women of Color in Romance website was a great resource). Here are a few that I found. Hidden Impact (A Safeguard Novel) by Piper J. Drake is a suspense novel.",
        "If you follow the vast world of fermented grapes, you may have noticed an influx of natural wines. I fell under their spell a few years ago. Apparently, I\u2019m not alone. There\u2019s something of a natural wine cult blooming in shops, bars and restaurants around the U. S. Natural wines can be mystifying: The first time you drink them, they may be and . Some (especially the whites and roses) can be darker than usual, a little fizzy, cloudy or with clumps of yeast floating about. They\u2019re often rough, which some people find charming. Others think they\u2019re unsophisticated.",
        "On last year\u2019s Abyss, Chelsea Wolfe explicitly rendered the metallic tendencies that have always existed just below the surface of her music. Wolfe\u2019s soulful howl found its bite in gigantic riffs and devastating volume that suited some of her most significant songwriting yet. But at the Tiny Desk, Wolfe took her songs back to their primal form with just her voice, a muffled electric guitar and a loop pedal.",
