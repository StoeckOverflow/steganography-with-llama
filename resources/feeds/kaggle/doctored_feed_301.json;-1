        "It may not feel like a reward, being a volunteer chosen to fight as a peacekeeper in North or Central African Republic. But for soldiers from one of the poorest states in the world, Burundi, it \u2019 s seen as an honour of a lifetime. Soldiers tend to wear the blue ribbon \u2014 and to pull an international badge and other benefits, covered by the United Nations. But just how far will one go to obtain a peacekeeping unit? Some may be going to troubling extremes. The U. N.",

Two former police officers stand guilty of murder, kidnapping and hanging nearly a dozen Maya women as domestic slaves and sex slaves during the country \u2019 s civil war. The war resulted in 200, 000 deaths and 45, 000 disappearances. Most of the kidnapping and other crimes targeted Mayans.

But for Dave Mason, the past few decades have somehow felt like a blur \u2014 from his complex relationship with his bandmate Annie Lennox, to his recovery from child abuse, to crossing paths with rock royalty in his literal backyard.

        "Donald Trump wrote in his 1987 book, The Edge of the Deal, that his grandfather comes from Sweden. These days, the US presidential hopeful and real estate mogul embraces different German roots. The teetotaler \u2019 s grandfather probably comes from a medieval castle called Kallstadt, in the southwestern German state of Rhineland Germany. Like many people of German descent, the Trumps generally stopped referring to their family heritage during the World War. Trump brags about the grandfather he actually knew in a 2014 German documentary called Kings of Kallstadt.",

        "President Obama says he plans to pick a Supreme Court nominee following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, setting up a confrontation with Republicans who control the Senate. Shortly after Scalia\u2019s death on Saturday, many Senate Republicans vowed not to confirm any Obama nominee, which would leave the spot open for the next president of the U. S. to put forth a candidate. But even if the nomination gets stuck in the Senate, Obama\u2019s pick could send a strong political message. So who\u2019s on the shortlist? Here are a few possibilities: Sri Srinivasan: The D. C.",
        "Justice Antonin Scalia loved a good fight. So it\u2019s only fitting that news of his death at age 79 ignited an immediate and partisan battle over who might take his place on the U. S. Supreme Court. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, . said the vacancy should not be filled until the new president takes office. And Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads the Judiciary Committee, which would oversee any nomination, said it\u2019s \u201dstandard practice over the the last 80 years\u201d for lawmakers to not nominate and confirm such nominees during a presidential election year.",
        "The Appointment Clause of the Constitution (Article II, Section 2, Clause 2) states that the president \u201dshall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . .. Judges of the Supreme Court.\u201d That \u201dadvice and consent\u201d role has meant different things in U. S. history. In the early days of the republic, nominees to the court got a passing glance. The Senate acted speedily, within about a week, from the date of nomination to a vote.",
        "In terms of the ideological balance of the Supreme Court, the death of Justice Antonin Scalia is monumental. With Scalia, the court had four reliable conservative votes and, in Justice Kennedy, the court had a conservative swing vote. That led to many decisions that were decided by a razor thin    margin. To gauge Scalia\u2019s importance, we dug through the Supreme Court Database and found that during Obama\u2019s presidency, 53 cases have been decided by a   majority that included Scalia. Here are six cases that could have turned out vastly different without Scalia:",
        "One thing that is undeniable about Justice Antonin Scalia is that his opinions were always a good read. He was a reliable conservative, but every once in a while he broke rank. Most of all, however, Scalia, who died on Saturday, will be remembered for his scathing dissents. We\u2019ve sifted through many of his opinions. Here are five that are worth a read: Lawrence v. Texas: In 2003, the Supreme Court Struck down an law in Texas.",
        "Antonin Scalia was just one of six Roman Catholic justices on the Supreme Court, but in his devotion to the faith he was second to none. Neighbors saw him and his wife, Maureen, worshipping frequently at St. Catherine of Siena in Great Falls, Va. a church Scalia was said to favor because it was one of the few Catholic parishes in the Washington, D. C. area that still offered a Latin mass.",

This can be a problem when people need county services, especially emergency services \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re an ordinary citizen or a Supreme Court justice. When Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died Saturday in Presidio County, it wasn\u2019t easy to arrange the inquest, the judicial inquiry into the death. Jeanette Duer, the judge of neighboring Jeff Davis County, explains how it works. \u201dOur county has 2, 400 square miles. We have about 2, 400 people.",
