        "Genya Ravan \u2019 s name has often been a hurdle : Strangers tend to stress the first syllable, or reduce it to something more conventional. ( Jimmy Olsen once casually referred to her as \u201d girl. \u201d ) Ravan was actually born Genyusha Zelkowitz, to a family in Poland. By the time she left for America in 1947, she had lost two brothers to the Holocaust.

        "Just a few days earlier, major world organizations announced they would decide on a plan to stop ISIL in Syria within a year. The proposed agreement could be temporary, and would come short of a full. Nonetheless, the nations involved have continued \u201d to encourage their proxies to cease operations in a week with an eye to a more direction down the road, \u201d NPR \u2019 s Matthew Kelemen explained Friday.

        "The White House says the president will not attempt to appoint a Supreme Court replacement for Justice Antonin Scalia while the Senate is in recess this week. In an interview with Fox News, White House spokesman Eric Johnson said Obama still would wait to select his nominee until Congress recovered from its break later this month. In an email to NPR, Trump said the White House had ruled out a recess appointment \u201d this year. \u201d \u201d At that point, we expect the president to consider that nominee, along with their responsibilities laid out in the United States Constitution, \u201d Clinton told ABC.",
        "The U. S. Supreme Court next month is scheduled to hear its fourth abortion case in at least a decade, and the reach of that Court is likely to be impacted by the life of Justice Antonin Scalia, who died over the case. A Texas law mandated that doctors have local legal admitting privileges and that hospitals make costly health upgrades to operate local outpatient surgical centers. Two other states have passed similar laws, and Scalia was widely seen to provide a fifth amendment to uphold such restrictions. Without him, it could not change much for California.",

A painful bone infection that developed after surgery and a year of care landed him in the operating room five more days, kept him homebound for a year and left him with joint damage and a constant limp. \u201d It \u2019 s really difficult for me to trust what doctors think, \u201d Peace said, indicating that there was little care to use to control the infection.",

        "In the movie Bad Max : Fury Rising, a renegade, played by Charlize Theron, races home from a dictator through a hellish desert. It \u2019 s like a car chase. The film isn \u2019 t your typical Oscar favorite, yet it has 10 nominations. One of those is for editor Margaret Sixel. Her article began with hundreds of hours of footage. \u201d We figured that it might take three years just to watch footage before you could actually do any work, \u201d she tells NPR \u2019 s Ari Smith. \u201d It was a huge task, and I have to say, some days overwhelming.",
        "As the Democratic primary contest moves to Wisconsin for Saturday \u2019 s caucus, Hillary Clinton is playing. Her triumph over Bernie Sanders in the Iowa caucus was and her defeat in New Hampshire resounding. Her lack of backing from younger Democrats has been especially striking. In Iowa and New Hampshire, voters under 30 voted for Sanders over Clinton by nearly 70 points. Clinton, meanwhile, had the strong support of people over 45. Sanders \u2019 support is more visible among young Republicans especially.",

        "When Marcella Lafayette started having really bad heartburn, she went to her doctor to see if there was anything that might help. \u201d I was experiencing a lot of chest pains, back pain caused from heartburn, \u201d says Lafayette, 62, of Portland, Ore. Her doctor diagnosed her with gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, and prescribed a drug like a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI.

        "Of the 2. 5 million Syrians to whom Turkey has opened its borders, some are in camps and receive help from the government and major charity operations. But most are in cities and towns across the country, and a small army of ordinary Turks keeps some of them going, week by week, family by family. One such group of humanitarian volunteers met on a recent Sunday afternoon at a commercial warehouse that does weekend duty as an area. It\u2019s an eclectic mix of Turks and a few expats.",
        "President Obama wants kids to learn to code. So much so, he\u2019s pledged billions of dollars to teach them. \u201dNow we have to make sure all our kids are equipped for the jobs of the future \u2014 which means not just being able to work with computers, but developing the analytical and coding skills to power our innovation economy,\u201d he said in his radio address on Jan. 30.

The hospitals are about 75 miles apart one of them is supported by Doctors Without Borders \u2014 also known as MSF. \u201dThis appears to be a deliberate attack on a health structure, and we condemn this attack in the strongest possible terms,\u201d said Massimiliano Rebaudengo, MSF\u2019s head of mission in Syria.

        "There\u2019s no shortage of contemporary writing about New York. While that\u2019s not surprising \u2014 it\u2019s the largest city in the country, and has always had a special hold on the American imagination \u2014 it sometimes seems like it\u2019s hard to find new fiction not set in the five (but usually just two) boroughs. That\u2019s a problem for aspiring novelists who couldn\u2019t care less about the city, but it\u2019s also one for New York writers struggling to find something new to say about their hometown.",
        "As a physics major at Yale in the 1970s, Eileen Pollack learned about gravitation and quantum mechanics and ballistics. She also learned what it\u2019s like to be The Only Woman in the Room, the title of her new book, published by Beacon Press last September. Unfortunately, many women with interests in science, mathematics and engineering (among other subjects) will relate to Pollack\u2019s experience of being in a conspicuous minority. According to statistics provided by the American Physical Society, women today make up fewer than 25 percent of physics majors, with lower numbers at the doctoral and postdoctoral levels.",

        "The White House isn\u2019t offering any names of potential nominees to succeed Justice Antonin Scalia, but it is offering a few clues. \u201dI\u2019d urge you to take a look at the two Supreme Court justices that the president has already nominated and successfully got confirmed to the bench,\u201d White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters Monday.

        "Antonin Scalia\u2019s body wasn\u2019t cold before his seat on the U. S. Supreme Court became tangled up in partisan politics. Here are five ways Scalia\u2019s death is complicating the 2016 election. 1. Obama looms even larger: After two terms, this election was always going to be a referendum on the Obama presidency. The upcoming nomination battle (even if the Republicans refuse to hold hearings or votes on the nominee, there will still be a battle) will make that even more obvious. Hillary Clinton is a .

        "In homes across the United States, families sit down around their dining tables to share a meal together known as the Family Dinner. This can be a joyous occasion or a contentious one. Whether you feel warm and fuzzy or grit your teeth at the thought, the family dinner is an opportunity for familial communication that didn\u2019t always exist.

And with gas prices averaging just about $1. 70 a gallon nationwide, they are looking forward to affordable travel. But on the other side of the world, oil producers are trying to engineer a different kind of freeze \u2014 one that could heat up gas prices again. Leaders of some of the biggest nations in OPEC want to freeze their oil output at January levels rather than continue increasing output."
