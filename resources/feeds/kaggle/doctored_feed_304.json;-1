        "When Barack Obama won the presidency in 2008, there was a lot of confusion about \u201d The Obama Effect \u201d : how the country \u2019 s first black elections signaled a new kind of racial harmony and democracy. That didn \u2019 t happen. But what did? The Obama family \u2019 s tenure in the White House has overlapped a revolution in the way politicians deal with identity. From race to religion, from gender to sexual orientation and beyond, marginalized organizations that historically worked and competed for \u201d a seat at the table \u201d also demanded their share of political power.",
        "Opera singer Lawrence Brownlee is known for recording kings and princes. But lately he \u2019 s been thinking about real people : Trayvon Martin, Michael Moore and Freddie Gray, to name a few. He \u2019 s been thinking about the Black Lives Matter movement and an American spiritual called \u201d There \u2019 s a Way Going \u2019 Round Taking Names. \u201d Decades ago, people like Paul Robeson and Lead Belly recorded it. Brownlee, with jazz legend Jason Moran, revives the traditional song to tell a real story for the 21st century.",
        "When Congress comes from recess next week, it will be the first time since Justice Antonin Scalia \u2019 s death for Senate members to hash out exactly what they \u2019 re going to do about the current Supreme Court nomination. And rumblings from Republican senators dispersed across the country could now suggest next week could be the beginning of a long family conversation. To make it very clear, Mitch McConnell \u2014 as the party \u2019 s majority leader \u2014 will get the last word on whether any Supreme Court president receives a confirmation vote in the Senate.",
        "In a few days, Google will formulate its formal response to the Federal judge \u2019 s order requesting the company \u2019 s help for the investigation to get inside a telephone used by Syed Farook, one of the attackers in the San Francisco, Calif. shootings. ( Click here for our comprehensive explainer on what \u2019 s going on. A quick recap : The FBI is asking police to lift security restrictions that prevent investigators from entering unlimited PIN codes to tap into the phone.",
        "It \u2019 s hard to overstate the computer world \u2019 s fascination with the alleged standoff between the FBI and Apple. Laymen might look at the dispute and shrug after all, the FBI is just asking everyone to help hack into one file, and it \u2019 s not unusual for tech people to help the police. \u201d Apple does provide \u2019 reasonable time \u2019 to law enforcement all the time, \u201d says Jeff Fischbach, a professional technologist who specializes in retrieving data from websites for use in court. But he feels what the FBI is demanding from folks in the San Bernardino area is qualitatively different.",
        "\u201d Shedding. \u201d \u201d Chops. \u201d \u201d Rataricious. \u201d Sometimes it looked like jazz folks have their own language. Of course, several times those words might end up in other people \u2019 s ears : Terms like \u201d hipster, \u201d \u201d crib \u201d and \u201d the man \u201d all disappeared from the jazz world more than 70 years ago. You dig? Here, Another Night In America gives a brief look at where jazz slang came from, with words of colorful language leading the way.",
        "Valentina Vitoria was born in December. She has microcephaly, the birth defect that presents an abnormally small head and can cause brain damage as well. The baby \u2019 s mother is Fabiane Lopes. She \u2019 s searching for her daughter in a tiny, windowless house in Rio de Janeiro. A whirring fan is the only relief they have from the surgery. In Brazil, doctors are getting closer to untangling the possible connection of Zika to microcephaly. The country has seen millions of babies born with this birth defect since the doctors arrived last spring.",
        "A report last week has raised questions about a pesticide used to kill mosquito larvae, linking its use to the chemical in cases of microcephaly in Brazil. But scientists say that \u2019 s an unlikely claim. The insecticide, called pyriproxyfen, is added to plants to prevent mosquito larvae from hatching and developing properly. Doctors in connection with a group called \u201d Children Against Fumigated Towns \u201d came out with a statement last week that said Brazil had started using the chemical in drinking milk a few months before health scientists began noticing an infection in newborns with small heads.",
        "When Rachel Mollen strolls into the room at Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens in Pittsburgh with her son, she sees exactly the kind of thing they will eat. \u201d Will, he \u2019 s the youngest of five, and he wanted to do something fun today, \u201d Mollen says. \u201d I was trying to think of some place that we could go for lunch and have a light lunch and do something interesting. \u201d The boy sits around munching his vegan cheese pizza, chicken salad and white wine. He is a bit unhappy, Mollen notes, that it is not chocolate milk.",
        "When Karriem Saleem went to jail in 1971 for the murder of Baltimore grocer George Lermer during a robbery, he was an killer named William Collins. In 2013, left prison after serving 42 years, 3 months and 3 days. Currently, he is 60 years old, living in the city of his youth, converting to Islam, subdued by death and often baffled by the experience of violence. Little things, including dining in a restaurant, can be disorienting. \u201d I \u2019 m cooking, I \u2019 m enjoying the company of my guests.",
        "Limacina helicina looks like most any other sea snail \u2014 until it displays what look like folded wings and \u201d flies \u201d through the air. A newly published paper in the Journal of Experimental Biology says the tiny wings of sea snail flew through water using the same system of motion that an insect use to fly. Take a look at the \u201d sea butterfly \u201d in general : It \u2019 s \u201d a remarkable example of convergent evolution, \u201d the researchers write. They said the ancestors of zooplankton ( such as L. helicina ) and those of terrestrial insects diverged some 550 million years ago.",
        "Along with contemporary sensations like The Babadook and It Follows, James Eggers \u2019 debut feature The Witch immediately joins the pantheon of horror horror movies, with the caveat that it \u2019 s just barely a horror movie at all. The two films, all rich in humor, are effective for their common association with primal fears : of motherhood ( The Babadook ) of sex ( It Follows ) and of a vengeful or even nonpresent God ( The Witch ). But of the two, The Witch is the least difficult to play by the genre standards.",
        "The doctor told Sharlene Adams to get a blood pressure cuff, so she set out to buy one. For Adams, who lives in West Baltimore, that meant four bus rides, a stop for a doctor\u2019s signature, two visits to a downtown pharmacy for other medical supplies, a detour to borrow money for a copay, a delay when a bus broke down and, at last, a purchase at a pharmacy on the east side of town. The trip there took 5 hours. Then she had to get back home. She seemed unfazed.",
        "Note: NPR\u2019s First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the Spotify playlist at the bottom of the page. The cover of Santigold\u2019s 99\u00a2 shows Santi White as she\u2019s tight like a Barbie doll amid a clutter of lifestyle accessories. Smacked right onto the cheapo cellophane, a yellow price tag declares the album\u2019s title, as if found in a dollar bin \u2014 or, perhaps, taking a clever dig at the cost of a single song.",
        "In the battle for primary votes, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are locked in a tight battle. But you wouldn\u2019t know it to look at the superdelegates. In the unseen battle for these party insiders, Clinton has an overwhelming lead. Of the 712 Democratic superdelegates, 449 (or about 63 percent) currently support Clinton, according to the latest Associated Press survey of superdelegates. Only 19 support Sanders. (AP did not reach 62 superdelegates, and 182 remained uncommitted or undecided.) Taking superdelegates out, Sanders has a lead among delegates, based on the vote in Iowa and New Hampshire.",
        "A few months ago, when we were in Toledo, Ohio, we spotted a small item in the Toledo City Paper about a tattoo artist named Brian Finn. Finn has been tattooing for nearly 20 years. These days, he does it on his days off, too \u2014 but not for just anyone. On those days, he\u2019s creating tattoos for people with scars caused by trauma: domestic violence, human trafficking or . And he\u2019s offering these tattoos free. \u201dOtherwise, you know, they wouldn\u2019t be able to get that done. Maybe they don\u2019t have the money for it,\u201d Finn says.",
        "On a visit to Argentina, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi decided he would honor that country\u2019s great poet Jorge Luis Borges. So during his talk at the University of Buenos Aires, The Guardian reports, Renzi recited the text of \u201dA la Amistad,\u201d or \u201dTo Friendship\u201d \u2014 a poem that some on the Internet identify as the work of the Argentine master. There\u2019s just one problem. It\u2019s . .. not. Not even close. Borges, a master of both prose and poetry, was famous for his recurring references to mirrors, labyrinths, libraries and dreams.",
        "Growing up in South Africa with a white father and a black mother, Trevor Noah confronted prejudices on both sides. He tells Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross that both white people and black people would express fear and biases to him. Then, he says, \u201dI\u2019d have to explain to them, \u2019Hey, you can\u2019t think like that. You can\u2019t hold these views, because you\u2019re generalizing everybody.\u2019 \u201d His experience growing up enables him to see both sides of an issue \u2014 which helps when it comes to creating political satire on The Daily Show. \u201dI\u2019ve understood multiple experiences simultaneously,\u201d he says.",
        "About 7 percent of homeless people live in rural areas, but homeless advocates say services in those areas don\u2019t get as much federal funding as they deserve \u2014 partly because the number of homeless people might be underestimated. Official homelessness numbers come from the count: A tally of a community\u2019s homeless population on the streets or in shelters. But in rural areas such as Wyoming and South Dakota where shelter space is scarce, people often crash with friends or stay in cheap motels on cold nights.",
        "In comments aboard the papal plane, Pope Francis suggested to reporters that it might be acceptable for those fearing the Zika virus to use contraception. The pope did not explicitly approve the use of contraception as he spoke during the flight from Mexico to Rome. But he drew a distinction between the use of abortion to respond to the threat of Zika \u2014 which he categorically opposed \u2014 and the hypothetical use of contraception. There are concerns that the Zika virus, currently raging across Latin America, may be linked to cases of microcephaly, a severe birth defect.",
        "Donald Trump has feuded with other candidates, reporters and TV networks during his run for president. Now, the for the Republican nomination is feuding with Pope Francis. On Thursday, the pontiff criticized Trump for the proposal at the heart of his campaign: a pledge to keep people from crossing into the United States illegally by building a wall on the U. S. border. \u201dI\u2019d just say that this man is not Christian if he said it in this way,\u201d Francis told reporters in a midflight press conference after a trip to Mexico.",
        "Morgane Stapleton is not a secret. In Nashville, the woman who\u2019s stood strong as a slender birch beside her husband, Chris, in breakthrough performances at the CMA Awards and on Saturday Night Life is known for being more than just a pristine harmonizer. She\u2019s a songwriter who\u2019s collaborated with Guy Clark and written a number one hit for Carrie Underwood she\u2019s also a vocalist in her own right, once dubbed the best pure country singer in town.",
        "When Susan Cain wrote Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can\u2019t Stop Talking in 2012, it was a big success. The book made the cover of Time magazine, spent weeks on the New York Times list and was the subject of one of the TED Talks, with more than 13 million views. From that grew The Quiet Revolution, a company Cain that continues to produce and share content about, and for, introverts. The site offers an online training course for parents and stories submitted by readers about being introverted. There\u2019s even a podcast.",
        "The Department of Justice has filed a motion to compel Apple to cooperate with a government investigation and help access data on an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino assailants. The motion filed in the U. S. District Court for the Central District of California (read it in full below) lays out the government\u2019s legal case for why Apple should provide technical assistance.",
        "As Apple and Justice Department lawyers duke it out in court over the government\u2019s attempts to force the tech company to unlock the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino killers, there are calls for a legislative solution in the debate that pits privacy against national security concerns. But the chances of Congress coming up with what would almost certainly be a controversial solution to a highly complex issue in an election year seem remote. In part, that\u2019s because no one can figure out how to resolve the issue. Absent legislation, there will be hearings on the matter.",
        "Making farmers markets more accessible to Americans in food deserts can boost the number of customers who regularly shop there, and may even offer more promise for improving diets than bringing in traditional grocers. That\u2019s according to researchers who looked at what happened when the farmers market in Flint, Mich. \u2014 much of which qualifies as a food desert \u2014 moved downtown. Availability of nutritious foods is of particular relevance in Flint, where the city\u2019s water system is now infamously contaminated with lead and other toxins.",
        "Albert Woodfox, who has been held in solitary confinement for more than 40 years, walked out of a Louisiana prison early this afternoon. This comes after he pleaded no contest on Friday to manslaughter charges in the death of prison guard Brent Miller in 1972. Woodfox was the last behind bars of three prisoners known as the Angola Three because of their long confinement in Louisiana\u2019s Angola prison. Over the course of decades, Woodfox has consistently maintained his innocence. And his lawyer tells The that \u201dno contest\u201d does not imply guilt.",
        "Jack Garratt has been called the \u201dsound of the year\u201d for 2016. That accolade came from the BBC. In the United Kingdom, he has already won several awards for his music. His debut album, Phase, comes out today in the United States. From the start of his musical career, Garratt has been a band, playing the guitar, drums and keyboard all himself \u2014 often at the same time. Garratt grew up in Buckinghamshire, northwest of London, the son of a police officer and a teacher.",
        "Johann Castro Hernandez is an college kid who loves playing soccer. Only these days, he can barely lift his legs, let alone kick a ball. His body looks weirdly thin, with no muscle tone. His movements are slow and tentative. For the past month, he has been in the intensive care unit of a health facility called Clinica Norte in Cucuta, a city in northeast Colombia where doctors have diagnosed him with syndrome, a rare neurological condition that can leave people temporarily paralyzed for weeks.",
        "With the Zika virus in the daily headlines, public health authorities should be looking carefully at how they communicate about this latest emerging infectious disease. People need to be alerted, not alarmed. That balance can be hard to strike when the health sources people turn to range from acquaintances on social media to politicians, instead of physicians and other medical professionals. The Ebola outbreak in 2014 demonstrated that many of the old rules about public health communication no longer apply. Elected officials and media used to turn to professors or government public health officers."
