        "The world wasn \u2019 t willing for Zika to fly across Antarctica in the span of a few months. In 2015, when the virus began rapidly spread across the Americas, construction workers were surprised, and others were caught when it came time to provide information to benefit the public \u2019 s health. Doctors misjudged Zika virus as a minor and severe ailment when it was discovered in 1947, says Prof. Ken Stuart, the founder and director of the Center for Infectious Species Research in Seattle. That fact is one reason for the dearth of genetic knowledge around the world.",
        "For a while Race, a handsomely filmed drama about a pivotal moment in the life of track legend Jesse Owens, plays along as a crisp, if grim, account of a black American who triumphs over poverty and racism to capture the gold. An unprecedented five gold medals to be earned, at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. But that \u2019 s way ahead of ourselves. In Cleveland, there are athletes, bigots to get in the way, and the winning coach, serviceably rendered by Tom Sudeikis, to smooth the path to success.",
        "PCHH regular Bob Thompson had the week off from the festival, so I was joined by Glen Weldon as well as our pals Chris Klimek and Bob Mondello to talk about the Coen Brothers \u2019 Hail, Caesar!. Chris engagingly reviewed it for NPR, and Bob has covered the Coens plenty of time, so we \u2019 ve got lots to learn. Glen has a theory of what it \u2019 s about, I have your personal genealogy for the Channing Tatum dance number, and we \u2019 ve all mixed feelings about Chris \u2019 Michael Gambon impression ( specifically, chances are that it \u2019 s amazing ).",
        "Many elementary and high school mathematics teachers are getting climate change wrong. That \u2019 s similar to the results of a new, nationwide teacher survey developed by the National Center for Science Education and published in the magazine Science. Before we get to those statistics, a quick, climate related refresher is in order. NPR Washington correspondent Christopher Smith says the world \u2019 s leading scientific organizations are now working on global warming : \u201d They \u2019 ve all understood : It \u2019 s happening, and it \u2019 s being caused by volcanic activity.",
        "UPDATE : British Prime Minister David Cameron says he has negotiated a deal with European leaders to approve the terms of Britain \u2019 s membership in the European Union. Security Council President Donald Tusk said on Twitter that the UK had unanimously agreed to the new deal. Cameron had been negotiating concessions for his country so that he can persuade Britons to vote for continued EU membership in a referendum process in the coming months. He added on Twitter that he would appeal the new deal to the U. K. \u2019 s Cabinet Council.",
        "Ted Heath needs an awakening among his voter base for a strong candidate or a surprise win on horseback in South Carolina. In any other candidate in the GOP primary, the Texas Republican, who talks of his faith with Catholics and frequently reiterates that he will defend individual liberty, might have the region \u2019 s sizable evangelical vote sewn up. The liberal bloc was crucial to his win in Florida earlier this month, and conservative conservatives make up an even higher share of the South Carolina Republican electorate.",
        "Another follows caucus day and late night on Saturday, when Republicans go to their caucus sites in Nevada, and Republicans go to the polls in South Dakota. Here are five things we \u2019 ll get from the results : 1. Is insulting the Kennedy family \u2014 and getting into a relationship with the pope \u2014 a good idea or not? Donald Trump has cracking down on almost everything in South Carolina. He called George W. Bush a liar in the last debate, leaving the GOP establishment to gasp in excitement.",
        "The TV presidential campaign for Republican Jeb Bush is faltering in South Carolina, where GOP voters go to the polls today. A new report by the New Media Project reports that the superPAC, Right To Rise USA, aired an estimated 2, 664 ads in the state between Feb. 1 and Aug. 14. At the same time, Sen. Ted Cruz \u2019 s organization \u2014 his support and two superPACs \u2014 ran 4, 904 ads. Sen. Marco Rubio \u2019 s office and superPAC aired 3, 882 ads.

        "Of all of the arts, painting may be the discipline most resistant to the nudge of technology, and photographer and designer Stephen Wilkes strongly embraces the challenge. His latest project, \u201d Day to Night, \u201d expands on the idea of showcasing, in one long still image, the beauty of a place over the course of a night.

        "0. 4 percent. That \u2019 s the amount of global development funding that goes to mental illness prevention, care and rehabilitation, according to Daniel Vigo. It \u2019 s $ 1. 5 percent of the $ 372 billion total health assistance spending around the world over the last 15 years. Vigo, a psychologist and psychiatrist at Harvard, believes that more money is wasted. And he also believes that one reason the percentage is so low is that the world doesn \u2019 t do a good job of assessing the number of individuals who suffer from mental illness and the disability and the premature deaths that result.",
        "What is art? Why does it talk to us? What does it tell us about ourselves? It \u2019 s something of the rage these guys to turn to neuroscience for answers. Neuroscience, after all, it is sometimes believed, holds the key to our very nature as conscious humans. I \u2019 ve been skeptical of the neural process. ( See here, here and here this is also a core theme of my book Digital Tools : Art and Human Performance. ) It \u2019 s not that I deny that our ability to create and enjoy a painting, for example, depends on our brains. Of course it does!",
        "Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Saturday, lay in repose at the U. S. Supreme Court on Friday, as the court, the public and the Senate paid their respects. While the argument over Scalia \u2019 s replacement raged in the political atmosphere, the atmosphere at the court was somber. The casket was carried up the marble steps of the Supreme Court on Friday morning, between two long rows of former Scalia clerks, and into the Great Hall. Inside, the remaining three justices lined up in their new positions of seniority, as they will be on the bench on Monday.",

        "So far this campaign season, much of the political conversation involving millennials has centered around college debt. And, no doubt, as we\u2019ve reported previously, student debt and college affordability are major concerns for many young people. But a majority of young people do not have a bachelor\u2019s degree, according to U. S. Census data analyzed by CIRCLE, the Center for Research and Information on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University, for NPR.

        "Today was trash day on the International Space Station, and as you might expect, it\u2019s not as simple as rolling a can out to the curb. Instead, a used resupply capsule was stuffed with 1. 5 tons of trash and cut loose. All that trash will burn up over the Pacific Ocean when the Cygnus supply craft, the \u201dSS Deke Slayton II,\u201d Earth\u2019s orbit, which not only makes this the biggest incinerator in the world, but also reminds us that the world itself can also serve as an incinerator.",
        "Peering back across Harper Lee\u2019s life, it can seem impossible to distinguish the novelist from her masterpiece, To Kill a Mockingbird. Lee died at the age of 89 in her hometown of Monroeville, Ala. on Friday morning \u2014 yet it\u2019s clear that her legacy will live on much longer than that, through her characters and the readers who have embraced them for decades. \u201dAmerica and the world knew Harper Lee as one of the last century\u2019s most beloved authors,\u201d Hank Conner, Lee\u2019s nephew, announced in a statement.",
        "Harper Lee, the author of the classic novel To Kill a Mockingbird, has died in her hometown of Monroeville, Ala. The Pulitzer writer was 89. Monroeville city officials confirmed reports of Lee\u2019s death to Alabama Public Radio. Her publisher, HarperCollins, also confirmed the news to NPR. Her famous novel about a young girl\u2019s experience of racial tensions in a small Southern town has sold tens of millions of copies and been translated into dozens of languages. Lee\u2019s family issued a statement Friday morning saying that Lee \u201dpassed away in her sleep early this morning. Her passing was unexpected.",
        "We were sad today to learn that Harper Lee, the author of To Kill A Mockingbird (and, much more recently, Go Set A Watchman) had died at 89, so Barrie Hardymon of NPR\u2019s Weekend Edition sat down with me to talk about Lee\u2019s most famous book and how significant it feels in our respective orbits. We talk a little about its portrayal of its unusual    protagonist, its respect for the personhood of kids in general, its imperfect but earnest efforts to engage issues of race, and the smaller lessons about kindness that it treats with great seriousness.",
        "Fifty years ago, Harper Lee had the kind of success that most writers only dream about: Shortly after her novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, was published on July 11, 1960, it hit the lists. In 1961, it won a Pulitzer Prize, and in 1962, it was made into an Academy film. It has never gone out of print. Lee stepped out of the limelight and stopped doing interviews years ago \u2014 and she never wrote another book. Still, her influence has far outlasted most writers of her generation.",
        "Last year was a terrible season for the American pistachio industry. Warm temperatures and the lack of water resulted in a loss of almost half the crop, and profits were down by around $1. 4 billion from 2014. This year, the industry is hoping to recover, but growers across the country may face a different issue: competition stemming from the lifting of sanctions against Iran. Iran is historically known for its pistachios. They\u2019re one of the country\u2019s main exports, sold in large quantities to places like China.",
        "When people talk about Florida\u2019s Everglades, they often use superlatives: It\u2019s the largest protected wilderness east of the Mississippi River, and it\u2019s the biggest subtropical wetland in North America. But it is also the site of a joint plan that is the largest ecosystem restoration effort ever attempted \u2014 one that is beginning to pay off after decades of work. The delivery of fresh water to areas of Everglades National Park is considered a vital restoration.

        "In the Florida Everglades, the alligators are in trouble. The reptiles are scrawny, weighing 80 percent of what they should. The alligators grow more slowly, reproduce less and die younger. Researchers are trying to figure out why this iconic species is in decline \u2014 and what it means for the Everglades. \u201dWe\u2019ve seen some alligators in some years that have been basically skin and bones,\u201d says Laura Brandt, a wildlife biologist at the Arthur R.

        "Imagine, for a moment, that Congress is targeting a military base in your state with stiff budget cuts. Think about what makes you more upset: the fact that this base has long played an important, historic role in your community? Or the fact that the budget cuts could have a rippling negative effect on the local economy? If you\u2019re more agitated by the former, you may be what Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s campaign considers a \u201dtimid traditionalist.\u201d If, on the other hand, the budget cuts make you more worried, you could be a \u201dtemperamental\u201d voter.",
        "The photo op at the end of Marco Rubio\u2019s Greenville rally Thursday morning was the stuff GOP dreams are made of. The young Latino presidential candidate many top party leaders believe would be their best smiled and cheered, flanked by South Carolina\u2019s female governor, the state\u2019s young black Republican senator and the congressman who\u2019s led the investigation into the Benghazi attacks and Hillary Clinton\u2019s involvement. \u201dTake a picture of this, because this new group of conservatives taking over America looks like a Benetton commercial,\u201d Gov.
