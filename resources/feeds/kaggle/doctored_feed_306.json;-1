        "My husband knew. He wasn \u2019 t young any more and was sick and scared but we weren \u2019 t expecting his death to happen as quickly as it did, within a few weeks, almost overnight. He just passed away. Maybe there are worse things than a quick, easy death. Here \u2019 s what happened today. My brother and ( who live a couple of hours away ) Ben : We \u2019 ll be there tonight, and we \u2019 re staying until you let us leave. A friend : I have some lentil soup, may I hand it over?",
        "On the eve of the Democratic presidential primary caucuses, the Press Department released an entire 1, 116 pages of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \u2019 s emails. Portions of 64 documents were retroactively described as confidential, according to a State Department official. That \u2019 s the next level of classification. The second batch of emails did not contain any Secret or Top secret documents, according to the officials. Friday night \u2019 s announcement brings the total number of emails posted on the network \u2019 s website to nearly 47, 000 emails.",
        "It \u2019 s just before midnight on a Thursday night when the crew of the Responder gets word from the Greek coastal guard that a boat with people aboard is nearby. It \u2019 s in danger somewhere in Greek coast waters in the Aegean Sea. \u201d There \u2019 s a sound, a flash, \u201d says Eugenio Miuccio, a Brazilian doctor, pointing to a figure in the sea. He and an Italian surgeon, Roberto Pantaleo, pull on red life jackets as the crew heads toward the boat. Iain Brown, a young rescue diver from Crete, is also ready.

        "How many times can The Internet mock Jeb Wright? So many. So many questions. Here \u2019 s the latest. Since the last Republican presidential primary in New Hampshire, Jeb Marin has been making a push to run in South Carolina, the first state to hold a GOP nominating convention. He \u2019 s gained the endorsement of South Carolina Sen. John Graham. He \u2019 s trotted out his brother, Joe W. and his mother Mary, on the trail.",
        "# NPRreads is a weekly feature on Twitter and on The. The premise is simple : Correspondents, editors and producers from our newsroom review the pieces that have kept them moving, using the # NPRreads hashtag. Each weekend, we hear some of the best stories. Despite the immense amount of news coverage focusing on the Black Lives Matter movement, something that you seem to care very little about is the mental health of the activists on the front pages.",
        "Mosquitoes have a nasty history. The species Aedes aegypti, for example, is mainly responsible for spreading the Zika disease through the Americas and also infects populations with dengue fever, chikungunya and yellow fever. This raises the question : Should there be an opportunity to get rid of Aedes aegypti for good? There have, of course, been many examples of species that are indeed lost for good. And a U. C.",
        "Saturday afternoon was a great time for public speeches. The winners in Arkansas and South Carolina each received one. Some of the losers did, too. Two politicians who had been fading in the latest recession came back to stand \u2014 and crow about it. Several delegates who fell short of their seats still claimed to have low expectations. And on the Republican side, even the fifth and finishers tried to find encouragement to complete their quests.",
        "Donald Trump posted a decisive vote Saturday night in North Carolina, a conservative state that on its face should have been inhospitable to the New Jersey billionaire, but was anything but when polls went to the polls. And Bill Clinton pulled off a much needed win in Connecticut, besting Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders with an older, more progressive electorate in the state \u2019 s caucuses. As we tap into the entrance and exit election data, here \u2019 s four takeaways from the results. 1.",
        "Authorities in Kalamazoo, Mich. are piecing together clues from a weekend shooting spree. At least six people are arrested after multiple shootings in three different locations in the area on Sunday night. Police arrested Jason Dalton. He poses as an Uber driver \u2014 and may have logged some hours on Saturday, according to police reports. In addition to those two, two other people were injured : a woman standing outside her apartment building who is attempting to survive, and a girl believed to be in critical condition.",
        "At pretty much any Lady Gaga album, you can count on spectacle : whirling bodies, elaborate sets and even, many costume alterations. When she took the stage at the Grammy Awards this year, things were no different \u2014 except that she was deploying her pipe pipes in the service of another artist \u2019 s music. As she pinballed through David Bowie \u2019 s catalog in a tribute to the late icon, it was a revelation that the Gaga is as much a chameleonic overachiever as her brother.",
        "A decision to remove Canadian citizens from being guest contestants on TV \u2019 s Jeopardy quiz show is causing a range of reactions in Canada, particularly among those who note that show host Alex Trebek has dual nationality in the U. S. and Canada. Media outlets in Canada recently noted that their country is singled out in Jeopardy \u2019 s voting guidelines : \u201d At this time we are precluded from seeking registration information from American residents. We are currently pursuing this matter. \u201d That led the Toronto Star to note, \u201d Trebek might be one of the only Canadians on Jeopardy!",

        "One black man in Minnesota is on his own diplomatic mission to undermine ISIS. Mohamed still works as a gas station manager in Minneapolis. But he \u2019 s devote much of his time to produce cartoons that explain Islam \u2014 and why ISIS is wrong. He \u2019 s the creator and director of a cartoon character he calls Average Mohamed. For the past four years Mohamed has been producing these online cartoons to try to counter the ISIS threat. In Minnesota in particular, with its large Somali community, ISIS has had the most success in finding recruits.",
        "There are three statues in the United States honoring Dr. James Marion Sims, a physician dubbed the father of modern gynecology. Invisible in his shadow are the enslaved women whom he experimented on. Today, they are unknown and unnamed except for three: Anarcha, Lucy, and Betsey. This week, we talk with historian Vanessa Gamble and poet Bettina Judd as we grapple with the troubling history of medical experimentation on African Americans.

        "His body wasted from AIDS, Fred Muzaya sat up in his bed on a January morning at Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, and faintly smiled at a doctor he couldn\u2019t see. A former taxi driver, Muzaya, 26, may have been infected with HIV several years ago, perhaps more. But it was only months ago that he finally went to a doctor \u2014 when a pain in his head that had started several weeks earlier became too much to bear. The culprit: cryptococcal meningitis, a fungal disease of the brain and spinal cord.",
        "If all you had to go on were his songs, you might think Marlon Williams was some crooner from the bygone American West. In reality, he\u2019s a from New Zealand with a Maori dad, who happened to fall in love with the music of Gram Parsons and Bob Dylan. \u201dI\u2019d just started writing [songs] for the first time,\u201d he says, \u201dand country music just seemed like the most obvious way to communicate.\u201d Williams\u2019 new album is a blend of rock and American roots music.",
        "Some churches have become inclusive of gays and lesbians, but for transgender people, church can still feel extremely unwelcoming. A congregation in Phoenix is working to change that by focusing on the everyday needs of its members \u2014 many of whom are homeless trans youth. It starts with a free dinner every Sunday night with donated homemade and dishes. \u201dThere\u2019s no shame. There\u2019s no judgment. It\u2019s here to help. We\u2019re about health and wholeness,\u201d says the founding pastor, Jeffrey Dirrim, as he points to countless toilet paper rolls on the table for anyone to take.",

        "The former head of the National Security Agency, Gen. Michael Hayden, says U. S. intelligence agencies got it wrong when they concluded Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, and they should take the blame for that, rather than the White House. \u201dIt was our intelligence estimates\u201d that were incorrect, Hayden says in an interview with NPR\u2019s Robert Siegel. \u201dWe were wrong. It was a clean swing and a miss. It was our fault.\u201d Hayden, a retired Air Force general, ran the the National Security Agency in the to the Iraq War in 2003.",
        "Nevada is a complicated state. Especially if you\u2019re a Republican politician looking to appeal to the state\u2019s increasingly wide variety of conservative voters. There are sprawling, diverse urban centers like Las Vegas and there are places on the side of highways that you could miss altogether if you were busy changing the radio. Lovelock is one of those places. It\u2019s a rural town of about 2, 000 people in the northern part of the state. There are six churches, a few bars and one stoplight in town, surrounded by miles of desert and sage.",
        "Americans craving kung pao chicken or a good lo mein for dinner have plenty of options: The U. S. is home to more than 40, 000 Chinese restaurants. One could think of this proliferation as a promise fulfilled \u2014 America as the great melting pot and land of opportunity for immigrants. Ironically, the legal forces that made this Chinese culinary profusion possible, beginning in the early 20th century, were born of altogether different sentiments: racism and xenophobia.",
        "You might expect the middle of the Pacific Ocean to be a pretty quiet place, especially a thousand feet down. But it turns out that huge parts of the ocean are humming. Scientists have puzzled over the source of the sound for several years. Now, a marine biologist reporting Monday at a meeting of ocean scientists in New Orleans says she thinks her team may have figured it out. The discovery started with hydrophones. Marine scientists listen to the deep ocean by dropping these underwater microphones over the side of ships, or by putting them on buoys.",

        "After disappointing finishes in presidential nominating contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, Jeb Bush suspended his campaign for president Saturday night. It was the end of a run that had seemed doomed for months: countless gaffes, merciless attacks from the likes of Donald Trump, seemingly limitless spending from a superPAC he couldn\u2019t control with horrible returns from those investments and perhaps, above all, a candidate who seemed uncomfortable on the trail at best, and at worst, frustrated and unhappy. Already, the are almost writing themselves.",
        "When Jeb Bush suspended his bid for the GOP nomination, it brought to a close a chapter in American politics that has lasted nearly four decades. A period when the Bush family played a major role influencing the course of the country. The combined Bush family political stats just going back to 1980 are beyond impressive. Two presidents. One vice president. Two governors. Seven national campaigns. And there were lots of victories, but unfortunately for Jeb Bush, the most recent one won\u2019t be going in the win column.",

Michigan Radio\u2019s Rick Pluta reports from the Kalamazoo County courthouse that \u201dprosecutors say that Mr. Dalton admitted to the killings after he was read his rights and so it seems like they\u2019re ready to move along pretty quickly.\u201d Dalton, a Uber driver, appeared via video at the arraignment hearing.",
