        "In the weeks since the world was introduced to Star Wars : The Force Awakens, the enormous power of its diverse culture has been revealed. It has engaged anyone who might have ignored the game after the prequels disappeared into the sarlacc pit of public disdain. It \u2019 s brought a shine to the eyes of children who \u2019 d never caught their reflections in a story so complex and sweeping. And it \u2019 s led already addicted fans to talk and write differently about the franchise they loved.",
        "A newly funded study suggests inclusion in TV and film is so common, the hashtag # OscarsSoWhite should probably be changed to # HollywoodSoWhite. That \u2019 s because of an \u201d measure of invisibility \u201d cited by researchers at the University of Southern California, who study more than 21, 000 characters and workers on more than 400 films and TV shows published from September 2014 through August 2015. They tabulated problems of gender, race, sex and sexual status. \u201d We \u2019 re suggesting that there \u2019 s not just a diversity problem in California there \u2019 s actually an inclusion problem, \u201d Stacy L.",
        "A judge is able to decide whether a suit filed over the mass murders at Sandy Hook High School in 2012 can continue. Lawyers for weapon manufacturer Remington Arms are appealing a dismissal, saying the company is protected from such suits by federal law. The lawsuit was initially filed in state courts in Connecticut in December of 2014, eight years after 20 children and five adults were gunned down at the elementary schools in Newtown, Conn.",
        "The Aedes aegypti mosquitoes really mean \u2014 literally and figuratively. They \u2019 re really good at finding and sucking on human blood. Which especially helps, because their inescapable, insidious little bites can infect people with the Zika virus as well as dengue, chikungunya and rice fever. These buggers \u2014 like most mosquitoes \u2014 will reach where we \u2019 re least likely to get \u2014 at the ankles, behind the legs and at the back of our necks. No matter how much you cover up, one or another will home in on even the tiny cracks of exposed skin. How do they manage it?",
        "A team of U. S. government disease scientists launched an eagerly anticipated research project in Rio on Monday designed to assess whether the Zika virus is still causing a surge of chronic birth defects. A team of epidemiologists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began visiting dozens of Brazilian clinics in Joao Pessoa, Brazil, in preparation to start work on Tuesday. The researchers will gather data on mortality of Brazilian women and their families.",
        "Luxury Italian fashion house Roberto Cavalli has built a new store in Iran \u2019 s capital, Tehran. This makes it one of the first fashion brands to formally join the Iranian market since Iran curbed its nuclear programs enough to trigger tax relief last summer. The lifting of sanctions was a major part of the Iranian economic deal. Now, many French and U. S. companies are already eyeing the Iranian markets, despite uncertainty about what sorts of business dealings will be conducted in the absence of many alternatives.",
        "Days after Microsoft \u2019 s CEO wrote an angry letter to customers, the President of the FBI responded with his own letter, urging those involved to \u201d take a deep breath and begin saying the world is safe. \u201d FBI Director Kevin Comey made his case in a recent post on the Lawfare website that was updated Sunday night, the main exchange in a battle over the bureau \u2019 s attempts to get volunteers to help the bureau retrieve an iPhone used by San Bernardino, Calif. shooter Omar Rizwan Farook.",
        "The debate over whether Apple should defeat the murder on the iPhone of San Diego shooter Syed Rizwan Farook isn \u2019 t the first time the company has contact with law enforcement. The FBI also wanted to get into the iPhone of a drug dealer in Brooklyn. Jun Feng pleaded guilty to buying methamphetamine last year. As part of its investigation, the government issued a search warrant for Obama \u2019 s iPhone. But the phone was blocked by a passcode, so prosecutors asked a judge for an order compelling Google to bypass it.",
        "U. S. food regulators acknowledged they miscalculated the amount of formaldehyde sold from some of Lumber Liquidators \u2019 laminated floor products. Shares of the stock fell sharply behind on the news. The Centers for Disease Control And Prevention stated the risk of cancer is several times higher than it previously estimated, and it strongly urged Lumber Liquidators customers to take action to reduce exposure to the environment. The company no longer owns the laminate products. The agency sold its \u201d indoor air pollution used an incorrect calculation for ceiling height.",
        "Until last month, the architect of Donald Trump \u2019 s presidential campaign was an FBI political operative in New Hampshire. Now, campaign consultant Corey Lewandowski can claim to have gained victories in South Carolina and New Hampshire and a third in the Iowa caucuses, a winning combination that gives Trump a winning shot at the Republican primary.",
        "More women with breast cancer are choosing to have mastectomies over surgery. And nearly half of them don \u2019 t spend a single night in the house but go home the same way, according to a federal survey. It \u2019 s the latest study to indicate that treatment for breast cancer is shifting after years in which women, particularly those with breast cancer, were encouraged to have less invasive surgery \u2014 and patient groups opposed outpatient or \u201d \u201d mastectomies. The trend surprised some patient advocates, who account for many women, less invasive options such as lumpectomy are just as popular.",
        "Book chapters love stories about students. The narrative arc is simple : Exuberant idealism fades as the teacher battles entrenched bureaucracy, stale curriculum and disengaged colleagues or kids. The young educator then tries to overcome despair with creative grit and energy and struggles to make a difference. The books often teeter between and slams against the American education system. Some, however, actually shed light on the yawning gap between reformist rhetoric and modern reality.",
        "\u201dI am what I like to call \u2019new stroke\u2019,\u201d says Troy Hodge, a resident of Carroll County, Md. With a carefully trimmed beard and rectangular hipster glasses, Hodge looks spry. But two years ago, his brain stopped communicating for a time with the left half of his body. He was at home getting ready for work as a food service director at a nearby nursing home. Hodge remembers entering the downstairs bathroom to take his blood pressure medications. He sat down on the bathroom floor and couldn\u2019t get up.",
        "Any doubt that Senate Republicans would hold the line behind their leader\u2019s decision to block President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee has been erased. \u201dI can now confidently say the view shared by virtually everybody in my conference, is that the nomination should be made by the president the people elect in the election that\u2019s underway right now,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, . told reporters. Senate Republicans on Tuesday held their first meeting since the unexpected death of Justice Antonin Scalia to discuss the party\u2019s strategy going forward.",
        "At age 9, Nice Nailantei Leng\u2019ete ran away from home so she wouldn\u2019t have her genitalia cut as part of a coming age ceremony. For her defiance, she was shunned by family and community. That was 16 years ago. The ritual cutting away of part or all of the external female genitalia continues in force around the world. A new UNICEF report estimates that at least 200 million women alive today have undergone what\u2019s known as female genital mutilation (FGM).",
        "Iran\u2019s capital, Tehran, is in political overdrive this week. Candidates for parliament are battling the Tehran traffic, vying for support in Friday\u2019s elections. This is Iran\u2019s first ballot since a nuclear agreement last July that brought the lifting of international sanctions in January. Long before the nuclear deal was signed, Iranians were told by their leaders that the removal of sanctions would bring more opportunity and better living standards. But for the most part, ordinary Iranians aren\u2019t seeing improvements so far. Taxi driver Arif Turkoshvand talks politics while weaving through the always congested streets.",
        "If this were a Sherlock Holmes story, its title would surely be \u201dThe Case of the Disappearing Quasar.\u201d In this case, however, the mystery wasn\u2019t solved by an aging detective, but by a young American astronomer at Penn State University named Jessie Runnoe and her colleagues. They study quasars, some of the brightest objects in the universe. Quasars aren\u2019t stars. \u201dThey\u2019re the result of gas and material falling into a supermassive black hole,\u201d Runnoe says. The gas heats up as it falls in, causing the region to glow brightly. The case began early last year.",
        "The Zika outbreak is aggravating an already tense relationship between Venezuela and Colombia. In Colombia, more than 37, 000 people have fallen sick. Venezuela reports fewer than 5, 000 cases \u2014 a number that Colombian officials find suspiciously low. Juan Bitar heads the health department of a state in Colombia that shares a long border with Venezuela. \u201dA lot of people who are sick with Zika in Venezuela are coming [to Colombia] for medical attention,\u201d he says. A big part of the problem is that Venezuela is in the middle of an economic crisis.",
        "To help prevent the spread of the Zika virus in Puerto Rico, government officials on the island have declared condom illegal. In early February, during a media briefing at the governor\u2019s mansion, Puerto Rico\u2019s Secretary of the Department of Consumer Affairs Nery Adames Soto announced that his agency has added prophylactics to the list. Stores on the island also aren\u2019t allowed by DACO to raise the price on mosquito repellent, window screens, larvicides and other products. U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data showed that as of Feb.",
        "The Twitter hashtag \u201d#FreeKesha\u201d has gone viral. The pop singer is not actually imprisoned, but she is trapped in a recording contract with Sony. It\u2019s not an unheard of battle in the history of music. But the reason Kesha wants out is different: She says she was sexually abused by her producer for years. Kesha wants to record new music. Specifically, she wants to record it while the lawsuit against her producer, Dr. Luke, is going on. And, she wants to record it without the involvement of Dr. Luke or his label, Kemosabe, a Sony subsidiary. Dr.",
        "In a relatively rare victory for abused workers, Vail Run Resort in Colorado recently agreed to pay more than $1 million to settle a sexual harassment case. The case was brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on behalf of members of the hotel\u2019s housekeeping employees. The company failed to address attempted rapes of its housekeeping staff. As part of the settlement, the company will have a monitor for five years and will be required to do extensive training of its managers. There are no recent, reliable statistics about sexual violence at work.",
        "Thousands of bands have made strong debuts, and many of those have made good second and third records \u2014 it\u2019s harder, but not unusual. It\u2019s truly rare to make your 10th album exciting and relevant more than 20 years on. For all that, I\u2019d say Wilco is an American legend. Though Wilco is basically a conventional rock band in form \u2014 guitars, bass, drums, keyboards, one lead songwriter \u2014 it defies expectations in so many other ways.",
        "Finding bread alternatives may seem like a thoroughly modern obsession. (Can someone pass the rolls?) But the widespread search for substitutes to white flour, in particular, dates back at least a century, to World War I, when Allied forces aggressively urged consumers to change their starchy habits for nationalistic reasons. On one hand, bread was symbolically important: It conjured up ideas of comfort that were especially welcome during a time of fear and turmoil. The act of sharing a loaf \u2014 literally breaking bread together \u2014 carried psychological weight.",
        "It\u2019s never clear what the truth is when a campaign ends, but it gets ugly. Major fundraisers are among the people who are key in creating a campaign. And when campaigns fold, they talk sometimes \u2014 usually in blind quotes. But one of the funders, who helped raise millions of dollars for a superPAC supporting Jeb Bush, talked on the record with NPR\u2019s Morning Edition \u2014 and gave his version of what he felt went wrong. \u201dI think the campaign was winnable, and we lost,\u201d Jamie Wareham, a Washington, D. C. lawyer, told NPR\u2019s Steve Inskeep on Tuesday.",
        "In a study powered by the labor of medical students, my colleagues and I found that of clinical trials led by scientists at our finest academic institutions didn\u2019t share their results publicly within two years of the study\u2019s completion. Moreover, none of these research institutions has a good record of sharing results. Many are much worse than the average. For all the focus on the need to speed up science for cures, we have a bottleneck at our nation\u2019s bastions of research excellence.",
        "Five Hong Kong booksellers disappeared and later turned up in police custody on mainland China, and nearly two months later, Chinese authorities have yet to explain how they got there. Foreign governments and the United Nations have expressed concern about the disappearances. The British government went so far as to assert that one bookseller had been \u201dinvoluntarily removed\u201d \u2014 basically kidnapped \u2014 from Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, the chilling effect of the disappearance cases has been most clearly felt in the publishing industry, which normally enjoys freedom of the press not found on the mainland.",
        "U. S. operation of the Guantanamo Bay military detention center in Cuba is \u201dcontrary to our values\u201d and is seen as \u201da stain on our broader record\u201d of upholding the highest rules of law, President Obama said Tuesday as he announced plans to close the facility. The administration\u2019s proposal is \u201dnot expected to go very far,\u201d as the reported earlier today. Devised by the Pentagon, the plan outlines how a shutdown might work \u2014 something that was requested by Congress.",
        "Saying it had been asked to look for a teenager from Sweden who had been misled by a member of the Islamic militant group ISIS, a Kurdish security force says it recently rescued the girl, 16, from Mosul, Iraq. Announcing the rescue Tuesday, the Kurdistan Region Security Council said that an ISIS operative in Sweden had persuaded the girl to travel to Syria and then to Mosul. \u201dShe will be transferred to Swedish authorities to return home once necessary arrangements are put in place,\u201d the council says, according to Rudaw, an online news site based in Irbil.",
        "Hillary Clinton wants you to know that she was doing health care before health care was cool. \u201dYou know, before it was called Obamacare it was called Hillarycare,\u201d Clinton said recently at a rally in Elko, Nev. It\u2019s a stock line these days in her stump speeches and debates. The term Hillarycare was coined back in the 1990s, when Clinton tried and failed to restructure the U. S. health care system during her husband\u2019s first term as president. It was supposed to be an insult, but now she\u2019s embracing it.",
        "When Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders stumps for health care for everyone, it always gets huge applause. \u201dI believe that the U. S. should do what every other major country on Earth is doing,\u201d he told a crowd at Eastern Michigan University on Feb. 15. \u201dAnd that is, guarantee health care to all people as a right.\u201d The Democratic presidential hopeful basically wants to nationalize the U. S. health insurance industry, and have Uncle Sam foot the bill for medical bills, office visits and prescriptions. Get rid of copays. Get rid of deductibles. Get rid of lots of forms."
