        "Apple should comply with the FBI \u2019 s request to retrieve data from an iPhone as evidence of a terrorism case, company founder Bill Gates says, staking out a position that \u2019 s markedly different from many of his peers in the app industry, including Google founder Mark Zuckerberg. The iPhone titans aired their views on what \u2019 s become a public debate over whether Apple should be compelled to purchase an iPhone used by San Bernardino shooter Omar Rizwan Farook. \u201d This is a specific case where the government is asking for access to technology.",
        "When it comes to the dispute over San Bernardino, Calif. Senator Syed Rizwan Farook \u2019 s iPhone, new findings show that media support is on the side of the Defense Department. Data from the Pew Research Center show that the majority of Americans \u2014 51 percent \u2014 whether Apple should cooperate with a new court order. Others say Apple should not help 11 percent say they don \u2019 t cooperate. But before we go any further, take care of an important technicality : Pew asked Google whether Apple should sell the iPhone, which is not actually what the judge requested.",
        "A new theory suggests that sea levels are rising at an unprecedented pace and that the problem will continue well into this century. \u201d Sea level rise in the 20th century was deemed extraordinary by historical scholars, \u201d says Bob Kopp, an assistant professor of Earth and atmospheric sciences at Rutgers University, and who is lead author on the subject, which appears in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Sea levels rose by roughly 5\u00bd inches in the past hundred years, Kopp writes, noting, \u201d That \u2019 s faster than any time since at least 800 B. C.",
        "\u201d Some things are bad and some things are right. And some things are both, \u201d Apple CEO Steve Cook said during a Thursday night interview on CBS News \u2019 World Report Tonight with David Lynch. \u201d This is one of those things, \u201d he stated, doubling down on the company \u2019 s data to create a way for the FBI to access data on the shooting of one of the San Francisco shooters.",
        "Author Isaac Asimov once wrote, \u201d The most exciting news to hear in science, the music that heralds new discoveries, is not \u2019 fun! \u2019 but, \u2019 That \u2019 s funny... \u2019 \u201d Good researchers search for the significance of events, coincidences and mistakes. With a little time and perseverance, they can turn unexpected experiences into new insights. The Bob Mole Award, from NPR \u2019 s Skunk Hour, celebrates these moments of serendipity in Science. We asked for examples of unexpected accidents in the lab and in the media from the past few years... and 300 submissions come pouring in.",
        "Texas is one of 12 states voting on \u201d Election Tuesday \u201d next January, but Republicans there are a little uncertain about this year \u2019 s election. Less than two years later, Sen. John Cornyn, won 48 percent of the Hispanic vote during his. Recently, in an election season driven by calls from GOP presidential leaders such as Donald Trump and Ted Cruz to build a coalition with Mexico and deport every immigrant who \u2019 s in the country illegally, some liberal Republicans fear policy of outreach is being undone if either state becomes the party \u2019 s candidate.",
        "Across the U. S. more than 20 million people take drugs or alcohol or both. Only about 1 in 10 is seeking treatment. People requesting treatment often have to wait weeks or months for help. The delays can jeopardize the chances they \u2019 ll be able to recover from their addiction. In fact, Health Commissioner Leana Williams has been pushing for treatment on medications, so that the moment people say they \u2019 re ready for help, it \u2019 s effective. It \u2019 s something other health departments have sought to achieve, including success.",
        "As the death toll rises in the United States, communities are trying to build more treatment beds. But an acute labor shortage among drug treatment providers is slowing those efforts. Each week, roughly one of every four clinicians nationally tend to leave the job, according to recent research. And that \u2019 s not just turnover \u2014 leaving one woman for another in the same field. As an Institute of Medicine report posted in 2006, there \u2019 s been a shortage of addiction drugs for decades.",
        "Social networks have changed the world, but they make things very complicated for the public. Facebook, Twitter and other media give the spy almost enormous amounts of false information about people of color around the world, but they still open up huge internet vulnerabilities. For example, how should the CIA find details about a spy who has been selling information about herself online before joining the agency \u2014 perhaps since she was in middle school? And can it give a convincing enough lie about people who have to lie about who they really are?",
        "John Brennan is walking with a limp these days \u2014 a testament to the hazards of shoveling your own driveway. Perhaps the director of the CIA had to come out just like the rest of Congress, after last month \u2019 s blizzard tore down Washington, D. C. But this past weekend, once he settled into a small armchair at the head of the table where he kept daily staff meetings, Brennan held lectures on subjects ranging from security to cybersecurity to the state of ISIS. NPR interviewed Brennan on Saturday at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va.",
        "Keila Atuesta Jaimes, a petite is lying on an operating table next to an ultrasound technician. The doctor moves the wand toward her belly. It \u2019 s pretty strong. She \u2019 s only about three months pregnant. Then suddenly, there \u2019 s the heartbeat! Atuesta thought. Nervously. About three weeks ago she came down with the kind of rash and bleeding she figured could mean only one thing : Zika. She thinks she went straight to the hospital, concerned her baby might end up with the birth defects that have been linked to Zika : brain cells and an abnormally small head, a thing called microcephaly.",
        "A lot of tourists to Colorado figure they may give the state \u2019 s traditional ganja a try, but they might not be responsible for the effects. When it comes to drug weed trips, have been doing much worse than Colorado residents and are going to the ER more often since recreational sales of marijuana began in 2014. The number of residents who ended up in the emergency room for reasons nearly doubled from 2012 to 2014, according to an analysis of emergency department doctors in 100 Colorado hospitals.",
        "On the eve of South Korean President Park \u2019s third anniversary in office, protesters gathered in Seoul on Wednesday to condemn the administration\u2019s increasing crackdown on free speech. These protesters were unlike any others Seoul has seen. They were holograms. The hologram \u201dghosts\u201d marched across a transparent screen facing an old palace gate at Gwanghwamun Square, a historic center in Seoul. \u201dPromise us democracy! Promise us freedom of assembly!\u201d the holographic figures chanted for 30 minutes, as a real crowd of more than 100 \u2014 mostly journalists and organizers \u2014 watched.",
        "One of the most puzzling astronomical discoveries of the past decade has just gotten a little bit clearer. Astronomers still don\u2019t know what\u2019s producing the brief, powerful bursts of radio waves they\u2019ve been detecting, but for the first time, they\u2019ve been able to see where one of them is coming from. Astronomers first detected these fast radio bursts in 2007. Until now, all 16 FRBs that have been reported have been found by combing through archival data.",
        "Mohammed Sayed is not one of those people who particularly relish the prospect of hitting young men on the butt with a big stick. But he is certainly prepared to do so to defend the girls and women who frequent the neatly groomed, municipal park in the Pakistani city of Gujranwala where he works as a guard. The park was designed as a place for relaxation and family recreation (it even includes some ramshackle carnival rides). But it had turned into a prowling ground for young men.",
        "Last year, Ford asked people if they could imagine themselves buying or riding in a vehicle. Out of the eight countries surveyed, India and China had the highest positive answers at 84 percent and 78 percent, respectively, compared to the U. S. and U. K. at 40 percent and 30 percent, respectively, the study found. \u201dWe do have a theory about what explains the disparity between these markets, and I think it gets down to the joy of driving,\u201d says Sheryl Connelly, who tracks global trends for Ford.",
        "Once Mumbai\u2019s largest slum, Dharavi \u2014 made famous by the 2008 movie Slumdog Millionaire \u2014 is a teeming and multicultural settlement claiming almost a million migrants from across India. Dharavi houses hundreds of cottage and industries, run mostly by men, who make products like bags and belts, zari embroidery and pottery. It\u2019s also known for its huge recycling industry. Together, these enterprises generate more than $650 million a year, according to some reports.",
        "While the dispute over cracking into an iPhone used by the San Bernardino shooter is at the center of a legal case between Apple and the FBI, the company recently told a federal court that it has received \u2014 and resisted \u2014 similar orders to help unlock iPhones and an iPad in recent months. That\u2019s according to unsealed court documents in which Apple says that since early October, it has received orders to access data on 12 devices, from an iPhone 3 to two iPhone 6 Plus models.",
        "You might think of Barcelona as an enchanted, historic European city. This week, it\u2019s home to a massive tech gathering: the Mobile World Congress. Tens of thousands of people from every corner of the earth are there \u2014 many showcasing the novel ways they\u2019re connecting to the Internet. I took a tour of Innovation City and here are a few of my most memorable stops. A Bike, The smart car by Jaguar \u2014 it didn\u2019t really impress me.",
        "As if there\u2019s not enough controversy over the Oscars, there\u2019s also the matter of a curse. This Hollywood rumor is often said to have started back in 1993, when Marisa Tomei won best supporting actress for My Cousin Vinny. Rather than going on to star in huge movies, as one might expect of a comely and talented Oscar winner, Tomei\u2019s film career fizzled. She appeared in small roles, or small films. Even the legitimacy of her win became an urban legend. Thus the curse: Winning best supporting actress is a career killer.",
        "British costumer Sandy Powell already has three Oscars, and now she\u2019s been nominated for two more. This year she\u2019s up twice for best costume design: one for Cinderella \u2014 with its sweeping ball gowns \u2014 and another for her work in Carol \u2014 featuring impeccable 1950s dresses. Carol is a love story starring Cate Blanchett as a wealthy woman whose marriage is falling apart. Powell says Carol can afford the latest 1952 clothes \u2014 including a blonde mink coat.",
        "The legal world has a new blogger: former constitutional law professor and current President Barack Obama. The president took to SCOTUSblog, the leading online chronicle of the Supreme Court, on Wednesday to offer some \u201d insights\u201d into what he is seeking in a justice to replace the late Antonin Scalia.",
        "The French have gotten themselves into one of their recurrent linguistic lathers, this one over the changes in their spelling that will be taking effect in the fall. The changes were originally proposed more than 25 years ago. But nothing much came of them until the government recently announced that they\u2019d be incorporated in the new textbooks, at which point traditionalists took to the barricades. The government has made a point of calling the changes \u201drectifications\u201d rather than reforms, and on the whole they\u2019re pretty minor. A few words like \u201dle \u201d and \u201dle \u201d will lose their hyphens.",
        "As the presidential race shifted to Nevada with Democratic caucuses last week and Republican caucuses Tuesday night, more young voters had a chance to chime in to the political process. Nevada is a state with a huge young, diverse population. But there is the perennial question: Do young people matter in politics? In every recent election, you\u2019ve probably heard some iteration of the same generational critique: \u201dYoung people don\u2019t vote.\u201d Millennials (born between 1982 and 2000, according to the Census definition) are the largest generation in the country. With an estimated population of 83.",
        "The Nevada caucuses on the Republican side were a game, and The Donald once again drew the ace. The other \u201dface cards\u201d were Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, with Rubio once again edging his fellow senator by a narrow margin. But it scarcely mattered. Their shares combined fell shy of Donald Trump\u2019s 46 percent. And no one else had so much as a nickel\u2019s worth. This is the part of the casino movie where you see a guy at a big table, winning hand after hand, stacking up chips in piles and towers.",
        "After a court ordered Apple to help federal investigators get into an encrypted iPhone, the company responded with a court filing Thursday that describes the order as illegal, unconstitutional and dangerous. \u201dNo court has ever authorized what the government now seeks, no law supports such unlimited and sweeping use of the judicial process, and the Constitution forbids it,\u201d Apple\u2019s lawyers wrote in the company\u2019s motion to vacate the order.",
        "Apple and the FBI are facing off in court over an encrypted iPhone 5C that was used by San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook. The phone stopped backing up to the cloud, which the investigators have already searched, several weeks before the Dec. 2 attack. It\u2019s unclear what, if anything remains on the phone, but the Justice Department says it has \u201dreason to believe\u201d that Farook used that iPhone to communicate \u201dwith some of the very people\u201d he and his wife killed.",
        "When Taevin Lewis first arrived at State University in St. Louis \u2014 a long plane ride from her native Tennessee \u2014 she was a little lost. \u201dI didn\u2019t know where to go,\u201d remembers the sophomore biology major. \u201dI didn\u2019t know where a lot of the offices were.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t just the campus map. She didn\u2019t know some of the basics of college life: How to sign up for classes, how to sign up for a campus job, how to maintain a checkbook. \u201dHonestly, if I did not have . ..",
        "It\u2019s big. The five remaining candidates for the Republican presidential nomination meet tonight in Houston, Texas, the biggest city in the biggest state holding a primary on March 1, which is Super Tuesday, which is the biggest voting day so far in 2016 \u2014 and the biggest all year besides election day in November. Whoever prevails tonight gets a long leg up toward being the biggest on Tuesday. And whoever sits on top after Tuesday is going to be increasingly hard to deny.",
        "Given recent advances in teleportation, it\u2019s reassuring to know that the human brain\u2019s navigation system appears to work just fine when we\u2019re beamed from place to place. People who experienced virtual teleportation in a video game were able to mentally navigate to known destinations without relying on visual information or perceived motion, according to a study published Thursday by the journal Neuron. And during \u201dteleportation,\u201d their brains produced a distinctive electrical signal that\u2019s associated with navigation. So if teleporters do start showing up, don\u2019t worry."
