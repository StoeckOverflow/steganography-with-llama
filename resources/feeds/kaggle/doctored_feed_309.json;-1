        "The most prosperous cities of the U. S. have recovered economically from the 2008 financial crisis, but many other places remain mired in severe unemployment and poverty, according to a report measuring employment levels by ZIP codes. \u201d The United States is truly a land of opportunity for generations. But when it comes to life quality, geography is too often used, \u201d says a report from the National Innovation Group, a global organization. Despite the slow recovery, the report argues, life for those in the most distressed ZIP code looks \u201d much more like an ongoing downturn.",
        "You will never catch prominent attorney Charles Marler eating sprouts. Not on a heaping deli sandwich. Not on a tightly tossed salad. He puts them in the same category as raw tomato \u2014 a food item he said is not worth the risk it creates. Unfortunately, 13 people sickened across four states have populations that risk the hard way. On Monday, the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say they are investigating a multistate outbreak of Salmonella muenchen next to alfalfa sprouts produced by Sweetwater Farms in Inman, Kan.",
        "With the opioid epidemic coming into every corner of the U. S. more people are talking about depression as a chronic disease rather than a moral failing. For Dr A. Thomas McLellan, who has spent his whole career studying substance abuse, the shift is a recent one, though it has arrived frustratingly late. McLellan is of the Treatment Center Institute in Philadelphia and former deputy director of the White House Office of State Drug Control Administration.",
        "Note : If you \u2019 re on DVD, we strongly recommend putting this video in the YouTube, Littlstar or Facebook apps. Since we started making Tiny Desk Concerts exactly eight years ago, we \u2019 ve had more than 500 artists play the Tiny Desk, our own little makeshift concert venue right in the rear of NPR \u2019 s offices in Nashville. From huge stars like Adele to to like Black Seat Headrest and actual big bands like Mucca Pazza, all these musicians would play behind MY microphone \u2014 but I move out of the way when they break up.",
        "One of the best ways to understand Zika vaccine might be to deliberately inject it into someone. That idea may sound a little crazy, but it \u2019 s not impossible. And some researchers are hoping the vaccine could help speed up the search for an effective Zika virus. Right now, a bunch of researchers are pursuing different approaches of making a vaccine against Zika, primarily because of the concern that the virus may be linked to the birth defects called microcephaly.",
        "It \u2019 s the first hour in the morning at a crowded public health clinic in Joao Pessoa, Philippines, when a team of disease survivors from the United States and Mexico arrive. They are searching for pregnant mothers in the hope of becoming one of the world \u2019 s most devastating public health concerns : Is the Zika virus really causing microcephaly, a birth defect that creates babies with shrunken heads and seriously damaged brains? \u201d The preponderance of evidence points to Zika being the culprit, \u201d says Megumi Itoh, an executive intelligence officer with the U. S.",
        "Meat has a larger impact on the environment than pretty much any other food we consume. As The Salt has reported, billions of humans, pigs, sheep and poultry we share as livestock guzzle massive amounts of water and generate at least 10 percent of the total greenhouse gases attributed to animal activity. But scientists think we \u2019 ve been slow to acknowledge yet another side effect of our taste for meat : water pollution. Nitrogen is an essential nutrient and a significant component of the air we eat every day.",
        "Humans have an easier time remembering the earliest and last of things than we do the middles. The numbers bulge out in our minds, becoming signifiers of the change. So for someone raised in the United States, when you \u2019 re asked to see the men we \u2019 ve sent to the Philippines, your mind probably jumps first to the originals : Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. You \u2019 ll perhaps remember their names with the swelling up of joy the nation felt at seeing those boots hit the right turf for the first time.",
        "When he thinks about his family, Alfredo Trejo takes a deep breath. \u201d Many of the victims who have been rounded up and will be deported, they already know their future, \u201d he says. \u201d They \u2019 ll die of hunger or they \u2019 ll be eaten by bullets. \u201d Trejo came to the United States in 2014, one of dozens of unaccompanied minors from Central Africa who flooded the U. S. mainland. He applied for asylum and, unlike many of the others, he says he fled persecution from mob members in El Salvador.",
        "When Dr. Etheldreda graduated from medical school, her mom told her, \u201d OK, ok. But you know it \u2019 s not good to just be a patient. \u201d Umm, what? \u201d She, said, \u2019 There \u2019 s some doctors you talk to and they don \u2019 t make you better. I wanted you to be one of the doctors that actually makes people worse, \u2019 \u201d Mpungu recalls. \u201d And I thought, \u2019 oh, no. What does she mean now? \u2019 \u201d Mpungu went on to work in a surgical ward. And then with others. She was helping people \u2014 but couldn \u2019 t tell she was really living up to her father \u2019 s high expectations.",
        "You may have done something like this over the last few weeks, in the to this year \u2019 s hotly debated Academy Awards show : \u201d The fact that there is an absence of performers at the awards this year is something I \u2019 m less concerned about than how that goes on what \u2019 s happening within the industry, \u201d [ the film producer Jim Holmes told a friend ]. \u201d We need more opportunities for artists and crafts people. There ought to be more of an presence in the various trades and guilds. \u201d Thing is, Holmes, who is gay, said that way early in 1996.",
        "If you \u2019 re tired of overwhelming whiteness at the Academy Awards, you \u2019 re in big company. Famous people and normals alike have expressed indignation over the fact that for the second year in a row, zero people of color were nominated for any acting awards. BuzzFeed compiled a list of people, like Snoop Dogg and Will Smith, who will be boycotting this year \u2019 s Oscars over that fact. Turns out, there is plenty to do tomorrow night besides wait to see which white person will get a prize.",
        "On Sunday night, the 88th annual Academy Awards will once again gather together the movie industry in a lavish ceremony to acknowledge the year\u2019s most celebrated performances and films. For some, though, the Oscars represent just another instance of the cool kids gussied up for prom night, trying to ignore The Others gathered by the punch bowl. This and last year\u2019s Oscars brought a chorus of indignation about the lack of diversity in the nominations for the four acting categories: In two years combined, the 40 nominated performances featured not one person of color.",
        "When NPR reported Bob Ebeling\u2019s story on the 30th anniversary of the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, hundreds of listeners and readers expressed distress and sympathy in letters and emails. On Jan. 27, 1986, the former engineer for shuttle contractor Morton Thiokol had joined four colleagues in trying to keep Challenger grounded. They argued for hours that the launch the next morning would be the coldest ever. Freezing temperatures, their data showed, stiffened rubber that keep burning rocket fuel from leaking out of the joints in the shuttle\u2019s boosters.",
        "Publishing giant Simon Schuster is launching a new imprint, Salaam Reads, which will focus on children\u2019s and young adult books featuring Muslim kids and families. The company said in a statement that it believes Salaam Reads, launched Wednesday, is \u201dthe first imprint at a major publisher focused on Muslim characters and stories.\u201d (The five big publishing houses are home to several Christian imprints, while numerous small, independent publishers focus on a variety of religions.) Muslims make up about 1 percent of the U. S. population, according to Pew Research Center, and the population is projected to grow.",
        "It\u2019s increasingly likely that the next time you have an encounter with a police officer, he or she will be wearing a body camera. And depending on how things go, you may be left wondering: \u201dCan I get a copy of that video?\u201d There\u2019s no single answer to that, or other pressing questions, such as whether you can tell an officer you don\u2019t want to be recorded. In the year and a half since the Ferguson, Mo. protests, police departments have been rushing to adopt the cameras.",
        "You know what a pain it can be storing and organizing the millions of videos you\u2019ve shot on your smartphone. Now imagine you\u2019re a police officer, and you wear a body camera every day. Police cams have suddenly become a big business. In the months since Ferguson, share prices for the camera manufacturer Taser International have doubled. But in the long run, the real money is in selling police a way to store all that video.",
        "On the fourth of July in 2005, Sufjan Stevens released Illinois, a record that made him a household name, at least among a particular set of indie rock fans and music critics. More than 10 years on, Asthmatic Kitty Records is releasing Illinois (Special 10th Anniversary Blue Marvel Edition). The titling is typical of Stevens\u2019 coy of consumer tropes (think: \u201dChristmas Unicorn\u201d) but the benefits, as always, are very serious.",
        "Like many European countries, Germany wants to send more asylum seekers back home. The German parliament passed several laws on Thursday that make it easier to deport migrants. The day before, Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government sent a charter plane filled with Afghan migrants back to Kabul. Many asylum seekers say they\u2019ve gotten the message \u2014 and aren\u2019t waiting to be shown the door. They\u2019re going home voluntarily, rather than being forced back.",
        "Marley Dias is like a lot of : She loves getting lost in a book. But the books she was reading at school were starting to get on her nerves. She enjoyed Where The Red Fern Grows and the Shiloh series, but those classics, found in so many elementary school classrooms, were all about white boys or dogs . .. or white boys and their dogs, Marley says. Black girls, like Marley, were almost never the main character.",
        "Like other presidential candidates before him, Donald Trump is under pressure to release his tax returns. Former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney (who faced tax disclosure issues of his own) even suggested this week that Trump was refusing to do so because they contain a \u201dbombshell.\u201d At Thursday\u2019s Republican debate in Houston, Trump explained that he cannot release his returns because he is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service.",
        "Nyalion Gutyua fed her children water lilies. And some fruit. Because that\u2019s pretty much all there was. When the dry season came and the water lilies stopped flourishing, Nyalion Gutyua and her children joined a group of about a dozen women and children and walked to Bentiu, South Sudan\u2019s second largest city. It took them four days. \u201dWe came here because of hunger,\u201d she says. She\u2019d heard she could get food in Bentiu from the U. N. They arrived at a city that is now a wasteland.",
        "As Donald Trump might say, Republican turnout in this year\u2019s presidential primaries so far has been yuuuuuuuge. Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada all shattered previous records. Meanwhile, Democratic turnout has dropped since 2008, when the fight between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton set new benchmarks. Super Tuesday on March 1 could also see new turnout records set. In Tennessee, where 58 delegates are up for grabs, party officials are already touting historic early voting numbers for Republicans as evidence that it\u2019s the GOP that holds the momentum heading into November.",
        "In their tenth debate with Donald Trump, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz finally got real. The two senators, who have been chasing Trump in the polls and in February vote tallies, came at him on every issue their opposition research teams could muster. They came at him for playing rough with immigrant Polish workers and for playing nice with Hillary Clinton. They called him out for supporting universal health care and for his neutral position on the Middle East. They ripped his businesses that went bankrupt and his school (Trump University) that went belly up.",
        "I came home from a trip the other day with a small plastic bag filled with 4 ounces of brown powder that, truth be told, made me a little nervous. The powder had a strong odor that reminded me of badly burnt coffee, with perhaps a note of brown sugar. I didn\u2019t dare open that bag. It contained crude caffeine, about 90 percent pure. That small bag held as much caffeine as 1, 000 tall lattes from Starbucks, or 2, 000 cans of Coke or Pepsi. It was enough to kill several people.",
        "At an estate sale in Rochester, N. Y. in 2009, a rare book seller came upon a curious literary artifact. As it turned out, it was a memoir written in the 1850s by Austin Reed, a black man who spent most of his life in prison. It\u2019s the earliest known prison memoir by an writer, and it has now been published as The Life and the Adventures of a Haunted Convict. When Reed\u2019s memoir found its way to Yale University, librarians and scholars were eager to get a look at it.",
        "The Zika virus now has a foothold in a U. S. territory. Puerto Rico is reporting at least 117 Zika cases, including at least five pregnant women. That\u2019s of special concern because of Zika\u2019s possible link to birth defects. In Bayamon, a San Juan suburb, Monica Figueroa is waiting in line at a lunch truck. She\u2019s a nurse who works at a nearby clinic and she is pregnant \u2014 \u201dabout five months and a few weeks, something like that,\u201d she says in Spanish. Figueroa knows about Zika. She says she\u2019s wearing mosquito repellent but is not especially worried.",
        "In the wake of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons test last month and its missile test in early February, the U. S. and China have agreed on a draft U. N. resolution imposing new sanctions on Pyongyang. North Korea is already under a raft of international sanctions, but the new proposal would tighten them and impose new bans. U. S.",
        "The terrorist attack in San Bernardino on Dec. 2 sparked a battle between Apple and the FBI over the investigators\u2019 request for the company\u2019s help to unlock the iPhone used by one of the shooters, Syed Rizwan Farook. San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan spoke with NPR\u2019s Steve Inskeep about his opinion of the legal feud and its consequences. Below are some of the highlights. On the value of what\u2019s potentially on the iPhone, I\u2019ll be honest with you, I think that there is a reasonably good chance that there is nothing of any value on the phone.",
        "Apple CEO Tim Cook put himself and his company front and center in a national debate on digital privacy, when he decided Apple would not comply with a federal court order to help unlock an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino terrorists. The Department of Justice has accused the company of using the case as a marketing opportunity. But a look at Cook\u2019s record running Apple since 2011 makes his motivations appear more nuanced and his confrontation with the federal government inevitable."
