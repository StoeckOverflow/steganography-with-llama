        "It doesn \u2019 t taste like chicken and it \u2019 s definitely not a chicken, but some people in St. Augustine are eating beaver for Lent. Many Catholics abstain from eating meat on Fridays in observance of Lent, the day of penance between Ash Wednesday and Thursday. The church has made good \u2014 at times, in some places \u2014 for native mammals such as beavers, muskrats and capybara.

Spain \u2019 s Civil War, pitting Fascists against Republicans, had just begun. Half a million people had been killed. But the violence didn \u2019 t last.

        "All that glitters is not gold in the chintzy little adventure Gods of War, but most of it is \u2014 a CGI festooned with golden sands and towering spires, ancient spears and bracelets, and metallic armor that shimmer in the sun.

        "These days, it can be hard to ignore all the messages to eat less meat and more vegetables. Last year, the World Health Organization used its megaphone to publicize the link between cancer and excessive red meat consumption. Environmentalists push the message, too, by pointing to all the energy, water and land required for meat production. Some animal welfare advocates, like the Humane Society of the United States, are all for a diet. We also get cues from pop culture. Did you see this Vegans Gone Glam spread in The New York Times?",

        "Artists shine given restrictions and limitations. Subtlety and nuance are more easily found in minimalism than excess. That\u2019s the beauty of Brushy One String, whose sound is made by one big fat and a voice so rich and full, all it wants is a bit of rhythmic and melodic underpinning. Brushy One String is from Jamaica, and his \u201dChicken In The Corn\u201d video has been viewed nearly nine million times. I first came upon his music at globalFEST 2014.
