        "The presidential campaign moves South on Super Tuesday, March 1. The event is considered a firewall for Hillary Clinton because of her strong support among voters, a key bloc of progressive Democrats. Greensboro, Ala. is in the heart of the black belt \u2014 named for its thick black soil and described as a place where the right to live is sacred. \u201d I \u2019 m a foot man, \u201d said Theresa Burroughs.",

        "Spotlight won the coveted Oscar for best picture when the 88th Academy Awards were handed out Sunday mornings in Hollywood, upsetting The Revenant and Mad Max : Fury Road, which completed the night with 12 and 10 nominations, respectively. Mad Max : Fury Road just about swept the three categories, winning six Oscars, but The Revenant also took many of the top awards.

        "In 1988, when Eddie Edwards presented the nominees for Best Picture at the 60th Academy Awards, he told the audience that when he \u2019 d been scheduled to present the award, his immediate reaction was, \u201d I \u2019 m not going, because they haven \u2019 t recognized black people in the motion picture industry. \u201d almost 30 years later, the 88th Academy awards will be presented under a blue cloud. For the second year in a row, all the acting nominations are white. After public outcry, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences changed its admission rules to try to diversify its programs.",
        "If Marco Rubio showed up with the Republican presidential candidate, it could be because he played Quidditch better than Donald Trump or Ted Cruz. Stick with us for a second. Last night, a SuperPAC sent out a ( ) fundraising email comparing Rubio to fictional Harry Potter. As Politico first stated, the group \u2019 s argument came down to an analogy that Donald Trump was like the Potter villain Voldemort, and the other Republicans in the race were seen as horcruxes, objects that Voldemort uses to identify himself.",
        "More than a dozen counties vote Tuesday, and nearly 1, 500 delegates are at stake. It \u2019 s the opening day of the 2016 presidential cycle, and it could be pivotal. Eight Southern states are voted Tuesday \u2014 Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia, Oklahoma, California, Texas and Virginia. That means on the Democratic side, Southern voters will play a large role. ( Six of those states, except Oklahoma, have strong black populations in Democratic primaries. ) But for the GOP, those same Southern states support a more socially conservative, more conservative electorate. But there aren \u2019 t just Southern states.",
        "On the Sunday evening talk shows, Vice presidential Donald Trump refused to condemn endorsements from a prominent white supremacist and former KKK leader, and suggested he retweeted a Mussolini quote because \u201d it \u2019 s a very personal quote. \u201d The extended comment about white supremacists came on ESPN \u2019 s State of the Union, where Jim Tapper asked if Trump could distance himself from an endorsement by Bruce Duke, former military wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.",
        "The Pentagon has promised all jobs across the world to women, including positions in the infantry and special police forces. The announcement in particular came after a nearly year, and with the acknowledgement that women had fought and died in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Issue, That historic question has raised another controversial question : Are women now entering the draft? The Short Bill, No. Congress would need to change the law that governs Selective Service in order to require women to register, and that hasn \u2019 t happened.",
        "When you \u2019 re in a band with John Lennon and Paul McCartney, it \u2019 s got to be pretty easy to convince them that you should get to writing songs too. But some of The Beatles \u2019 most important tracks \u2014 \u201d Something, \u201d \u201d Here Comes the Sun, \u201d \u201d While My Guitar Gently Weeps, \u201d \u201d Taxman \u201d and several \u2014 were actually penned by \u201d the latter one. \u201d George Harrison died of cancer in 2001, and since then, his son, Dhani, has kept his family \u2019 s spirit alive in great ways.",

        "With apologies to Andy Williams, now is the most wonderful time of the month... for it is Girl Scout Christmas season. But after plowing through several packs of Thin Mints, fatigue can set in. So we wondered, when you \u2019 re starting to grow sick of Girl Scout cookies, is there a way to rekindle the fire? We turned to Dan Pashman, creator of The Sporkful podcast at WNYC studios, for news. His book, Eat More Coffee, tackles this pressing public interest matter.",
        "The Fillmore District of San Francisco was once known as the \u201d Village of the West \u201d for its rich blues and jazz roots. This night, the neighborhood \u2019 s beloved historic John Coltrane African American Church may be challenging to find a new home. \u201d The church is almost never going to Jerusalem or maybe to Mecca, so people pilgrim here from all over the world, \u201d says Archbishop Franzo Joseph King Sr. who the pastor of John Coltrane devotees in 1969.",
        "Once every three years, people arriving on Feb. 29 actually start to celebrate their birthday.

        "With every state that voted in February, the contours of the 2016 presidential election changed. Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada all transformed the landscape in both parties. On Saturday night, in South Carolina, the Earth moved once again. Hillary Clinton won, as expected, but the breadth and depth of her victory were breathtaking. She prevailed by more than 47 percentage points in the most populous state to vote thus far, winning by more than twice the margin of her loss to Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire on Feb. 9.",
        "It\u2019s not often that Hollywood loses one of its great icons \u2014 an icon whose career spans decades and runs a gamut of some of America\u2019s films. From Grease to Terminator 2, from Roadblock to Gone in 60 Seconds, the unlikely star never became a legend despite never really getting top billing. \u201dIt\u2019s not the lead character,\u201d says Dan Koeppel, a Los author who writes about transportation. \u201dIt plays a supporting role, and that\u2019s what it should be doing.\u201d The icon, of course, is not an actor at all.",
        "\u201dEver since I was a little boy, I\u2019ve been trying to reconcile constructivist aesthetics and fascist metaphysics. ..lucidity and violence. ..and the endless implications of that dichotomy.\u201d That\u2019s Mark Leyner, ladies and gentlemen. One of the best, the brightest, the weirdest and the most influential modern writers of, say, 1996.

        "Two composers and a songwriter walk into a bar. That\u2019s not the start of a joke it\u2019s the start of a band. Keefus Ciancia has composed for the TV shows True Detective and The Fall. David Holmes is a DJ, producer, and the man behind the score of the Ocean\u2019s 11 franchise. And Jade Vincent is a songwriter with a sultry voice, who sang at the saloon where the three musicians began their collaboration. Guilty of Love, the trio\u2019s debut album as Unloved, is out Friday. \u201dTo me, a lot of things are discovered in dark places,\u201d Vincent says.",
        "The biggest group of voters politicians will have to woo this November are the ones who often don\u2019t get a say in which candidates make it to the general election ballot. Turned off by the partisan wars in Washington, 39 percent of voters now identify themselves as independent rather than affiliated with one of the two major political parties, according to a 2014 analysis by the Pew Research Center. Democrats accounted for 32 percent of the electorate, Republicans 23 percent.",
        "Oh, you didn\u2019t hear? Turns out Friday was our birthday. On that day, precisely 46 years ago, this little organization of ours was incorporated under the name National Public Radio. Yes, we\u2019re aware already that your gift must be in the mail. (Right?) And yes, thank you, we are easing into our middle age with charm and aplomb. (Ahem \u2014 right?) At any rate, we were also blown away by the love you all showed us on Facebook and Twitter. So much so, in fact, that we wanted to do a little something for you in return.",
        "Washington was actually talking about someone other than Donald Trump on Monday, and that someone was not another presidential candidate. It was Supreme Court Associate Justice Clarence Thomas. People were talking about Thomas because Thomas was talking. In the Supreme Court chamber, during oral arguments, the Thomas asked multiple questions. There might seem to be nothing out of the ordinary in that, except that Thomas had gone since February 2006 hearing hundreds of oral arguments without asking a single question. Thomas has not been entirely silent all these years.",
        "Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas drew gasps on Monday when he asked several questions during oral arguments. Thomas, who hadn\u2019t asked a question since Feb. 22, 2006, broke 10 years of near silence during a case, Voisine v. U. S. involving a federal law preventing people convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence from owning firearms. The justices were hearing appeals from two Maine men who say their guilty pleas for hitting their partners should not disqualify them from gun ownership.",
        "For decades massive, coal mines have been feeding the country\u2019s appetite for energy. Once coal companies are done with the land, they\u2019re supposed to restore it. But as America\u2019s coal industry declines, it may not have the funding to keep its cleanup promises. Restoring a mine to its original state is an elaborate and expensive process, one that some say makes the land better than before.",
        "Researchers are working furiously to determine if the Zika virus now spreading in Latin America is responsible for a spike in cases in syndrome, a condition that can cause temporary paralysis. But a paper published today in The Lancet argues that a link can already be established. The paper looks at an outbreak of Zika in the islands of French Polynesia in 2013, when of the 270, 000 population was infected in a period of about six months. Most of them had no symptoms at all. Some experienced mild symptoms \u2014 fever, rash, muscle pain, conjunctivitis.",
        "Every morning since I arrived in Brazil to cover the Zika outbreak, the first thing I do is douse myself with insect repellent before venturing outside. I know the chances I\u2019ll catch Zika are pretty low, and the disease tends to be relatively mild for most healthy adult males. But with all the alarm about the virus, it\u2019s hard not to start to get a little paranoid about catching Zika from a mosquito.",
        "The phrase \u201dSuper Tuesday\u201d first emerged in 1980, when three Southern states \u2014 Alabama, Florida and Georgia \u2014 held their primaries on the same day. It grew to nine in 1984. But the Super Tuesday was born in 1988, when a dozen Southern states on the Democratic side, upset with the nomination of Walter Mondale four years earlier and frustrated with being out of power in the White House for 20 years save for one term of Jimmy Carter, banded together to try to nominate someone more moderate. It backfired.",
        "People in Texas are significantly more likely than adults nationwide to report that it has gotten harder to see a doctor in the past two years. The finding comes from polling done by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. Vera Brown has been stuck aboard the doctor for years now, trying to find an orthopedic surgeon who accepts her insurance. She doesn\u2019t find the seemingly endless calls, questions or repetition amusing. \u201dWhen they say I\u2019m not covered that means I have to put off having surgery,\u201d she says.",
        "A series of polls in key states by NPR and its partners finds that more than half of adults in the U. S. believe the Affordable Care Act has either helped the people of their state or has had no effect. Those sentiments are common despite all the political wrangling that continues over the law. About a third (35 percent) of adults say the law has directly helped the people of their state, while a quarter (27 percent) say it has directly hurt people. \u201dThe proportion of U. S.",

        "Host Chris Rock made sure Sunday\u2019s Oscars were about as black as they could be, given that no black people had been nominated in any categories. Of course, Rock brought the pain, as he always does, in a monologue skewering sensibilities on all sides of the #OscarsSoWhite debate. And his comedy bits throughout the show kept up a steady drumbeat, reminding audiences in the hall and at home just who had been left behind. That meant two Suge Knight jokes, featuring the actor who played him in Straight Outta Compton.",
        "You can say this for Sunday night\u2019s Oscars: It seemed like a lot of it was going to be about inclusion or lack thereof, and it was. Back in 2012, Chris Rock presented the Oscar for best animated feature, explaining that he loved animation because it makes anything possible. \u201dI love animation,\u201d he said, \u201dbecause in the world of animation, you can be anything you wanna be. If you\u2019re a fat woman, you can play a skinny princess. If you\u2019re a short, wimpy guy, you can play a tall gladiator."
