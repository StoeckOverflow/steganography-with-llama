A Girl In The Air : The Price Of Forgiveness is by Pakistani writer Sharmeen. The documentary tackles the main topic of honor murder in Pakistan, from a rare point of view : a survivor \u2019 s. Saba, an Indian, was shot and thrown in a boat by her own family for secretly eloping with her mother \u2014 and lived to tell the truth.",
        "Argentina has made an agreement with some of its creditors that should eventually end a long and acrimonious dispute that has blocked the country from the international bond markets. The deal, which must be approved by Argentina \u2019 s Congress, calls for the Treasury to pay $ 4. 653 billion to victims of the holdout U. S. hedge fund. That equals about 75 percent of what they claimed they were owed.",
        "Denmark is once again involved itself in the race against food stamps \u2014 this time, with a supermarket hawking item once destined for the trash cans. Those items might include treats for a holiday that began last week, a big box of cornflakes, plain wheat rice mislabeled as basmati, or anything nearing its expiration date. In other words, perfectly ordinary items that are nonetheless judged unfit for sale by the retailers and consumers who donate them. WeFood is not the first grocer in Denmark to sell surplus goods.",
        "The crux of Ted Cruz \u2019 s campaign has long been mobilizing the public right to his side, helping to galvanize enough evangelical Republicans to topple Donald Trump. The young senator even led his campaign at Liberty University, which claims to be the world \u2019 s first Christian college, arguing that \u201d God isn \u2019 t done with Jesus yet. \u201d Cruz spoke with the cadence of a megachurch pastor, and exhortations of his faith are a mainstay at every campaign rally. His efforts in targeting the most conservative American voters worked in Washington, but the wheels came off in North Carolina and Nevada.",
        "Politicians of all stripes have to always contend with attracting supporters that don \u2019 t fully fit the image they are trying to portray. Donald Trump has received support in recent days from governors and a U. S. senator, but also a white supremacist. It was late last summer when David Duke, a prominent Ku Klux Klan leader, urged his radio listeners to vote for Trump. \u201d Voting against Donald Trump at this point is really related to your heritage, \u201d he said. So anyway, CNN \u2019 s Jake Tapper asked the billionaire businessman if he would disavow that endorsement. Trump dodged.",
        "It \u2019 s now well past midnight in South Korea \u2014 which means that a filibuster that started last Tuesday is on its way to airing for a full week. Local legislators have now spoken for some 150 days straight, holding up a resolution that would give greater surveillance powers to South Korea \u2019 s spy service. The filibuster \u2019 s hours seem longer, however, with the Yonhap news outlet saying that leaders of the opposition opposition party have now decided to end the filibuster. They \u2019 re expected to start a news conference about the incident at 9 a. m. Tuesday, local news ( 7 p. m.",
        "\u201d Stronger Together \u201d is not the result of the latest fitness programs. It \u2019 s a grant proposed in President Obama \u2019 s new cabinet, reviving an idea that hasn \u2019 t gotten national policy attention in yet : diversity in public schools. If the request is approved, $ 120 million will go to school districts for programs intended to make their schools more diverse. As a recent pair of reports from the progressive Century Foundation showed, integration policies have enjoyed a resurgence : In 2007, 40 districts pursued consolidation. Today that number has more than grown, to 83, plus nine alternative schools or networks.",
        "For his part in an incident that rescued an American sailor who was being held hostage in Somalia, U. S. Navy SEAL Senior Chief Special Operations Operator Edward Byers was presented with the Medal of Honor at the White House on Monday. You can watch the ceremony via White House video. President Obama called the ceremony \u201d a good opportunity \u201d for Americans to catch a glimpse of the country \u2019 s military operators \u2014 Byers is a member of the Naval SEAL Team Six.",
        "Final gains are beginning to trickle in from Iran \u2019 s democratic elections, and these returns make major gains for the nation \u2019 s moderate camp. It \u2019 s a serious blow to Iran \u2019 s hardliners in the general election since last year \u2019 s historic economic deal with world peace. NPR \u2019 s Peter Kenyon supports reformist parliamentary candidates swept the seats in Iran \u2019 s capital, Tehran. \u201d All hardline incumbents in the capital lost their seats, \u201d Peter states, though he says conservatives fared worse in other provinces.",
        "To understand how John Sanders \u2019 presidential race is reacting to the candidate \u2019 s gigantic upset in South Carolina \u2019 s blanket primary, it \u2019 s important to understand how he reacted to another win just a few weeks ago, in Arkansas. The two results couldn \u2019 t be more comparable. Sanders \u2019 performance in Connecticut could be considered a major tie with Hillary Clinton, and he called it just that. Clinton won the Florida caucuses by less than half a percentage point.",
        "If you want to change Clinton \u2019 s Super Tuesday strategy all you need to do is glance at her travel schedule : Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee and even in Massachusetts and Virginia. In these weeks she \u2019 s delivering a relatively lighter, more positive message. There \u2019 s less drawing contrasts with her former opponent Vermont Rep. Bernie Sanders and more ways of \u201d breaking down barriers \u201d and \u201d compassion and kindness. \u201d \u201d I want America to break down the barriers that stand in the way of people being involved, that stand in the way of us fulfilling our potential, \u201d Bill told an enthusiastic reporter in Springfield, MA.",
        "Hillary Clinton goes into Super Tuesday with a lead ( ) over Vermont def. Bernie Sanders. She already has a lead ( ). In crunching some numbers, an alternative analysis finds one very rosy scenario for Sanders in which he comes out with the majority of pledged voters on Super Tuesday. This is highly unlikely, but it \u2019 s his best ever day. The analysis also shows close to Sanders \u2019 s best day, including winning Colorado, Kansas and Oklahoma \u2014 all places Sanders is targeting. It gives Sanders big wins in Wisconsin and Minnesota. That second day would give Sanders a win.",
        "Note: NPR\u2019s First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the Spotify playlist at the bottom of the page. \u201dWe grieve so deep in disguise The private lives of private eyes,\u201d Thao sings in \u201dHand To God.\u201d It\u2019s a simple yet striking line that illuminates the emotional backbone of her brilliant, jarring new album, A Man Alive. Throughout the record, Thao ruminates on how little we know of the turmoil people carry around inside \u2014 and opens up about her own lingering wounds.",
        "Every winter, a small fleet of commercial fishing boats sets gillnets in the San Francisco Bay. Their target: Pacific herring, which enter the estuary in huge numbers to spawn and are easily caught by the millions. The fishermen fill their holds with herring just yards from the waterfront of downtown San Francisco, where many restaurants serve fresh, locally caught seafood. But they rarely serve herring. Rather, nearly all the herring caught by commercial fishermen in the bay are ultimately fed to animals, including fish.",
        "Craig Windham, a voice familiar to many NPR listeners, died unexpectedly last night of a pulmonary embolism. He was 66. Windham was an journalist who covered presidential campaigns, hurricanes, earthquakes and the first Persian Gulf War. More recently, he focused on anchoring and reporting for NPR\u2019s Newscasts. In less than 40 seconds, Windham could explain the intricacies of a complicated bill or capture the glory of a space shuttle flying over the nation\u2019s capital. \u201dCraig touched so many lives,\u201d Robert Garcia, the executive producer of NPR\u2019s Newscasts, told the staff in an email.",
        "These four musicians made their first record together a decade ago, but for many of us, 2016 will be the year Lake Street Dive becomes a household name. The appeal of this band of New England Conservatory friends lies in their warmth in harmony and comfortably styled songs \u2014 sometimes tilting toward soul, often rocking danceably on a new collection of songs called Side Pony.",
        "The big day is finally here \u2014 after tonight\u2019s Super Tuesday results, there will be a much clearer picture of how both the Republican and Democratic races could shake out. Will Donald Trump continue his dominance? Can Marco Rubio catch up? Can Ted Cruz rebound? Will Hillary Clinton roll through the South? Can Bernie Sanders bounce back after a devastating South Carolina loss? More than a dozen states are voting today \u2014 some in primaries, some in caucuses whose results may not be known for quite a while.",
        "Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump notched big wins across the South on Super Tuesday as they extended their leads for their party\u2019s nomination. On the Republican side, Trump has won seven states: Virginia, Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, Vermont, Massachusetts and Georgia. Sen. Ted Cruz won his home state of Texas, eked out a surprise victory in Oklahoma and won the caucuses in Alaska. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio finally got his first outright win by taking the Minnesota caucuses. In the Democratic race, Clinton also captured seven states: Georgia, Virginia, Texas, Alabama, Tennessee, Massachusetts and her onetime home of Arkansas. Sen.",

        "FBI Director James Comey says encryption is making phones \u201dwarrantproof\u201d \u2014 and the agency\u2019s dispute with Apple over an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters shows the challenges encryption poses in criminal and counterterrorism investigations. Apple is challenging a federal court order obtained by the FBI that compels the tech giant to write special software that would lift some security restrictions and let the FBI crack the passcode on the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s win in the South Carolina Democratic primary was a blowout, and black voters in particular are being credited with handing her that victory. More than 8 in 10 black voters in that state voted for Clinton, according to exit polls. If that trend holds, she could have a great day on Super Tuesday, when several states in her Southern \u201dfirewall\u201d \u2014 several of which have substantial black populations \u2014 will vote. There are a lot of reasons for her strength with this demographic: her name recognition, her record and her politics, for example.",

        "Havana will meet the Rolling Stones later this month. The band has announced they\u2019ll play a free concert in the Cuban capital on March 25. That will make them \u201dthe most famous act to play Cuba since its 1959 revolution,\u201d the Associated Press reports. \u201dWe have performed in many special places during our long career but this show in Havana is going to be a landmark event for us, and, we hope, for all our friends in Cuba too,\u201d the Rolling Stones said in a statement.

        "Gov. Dennis Daugaard has vetoed a bill that would have required transgender students in South Dakota\u2019s public schools to use bathrooms, locker rooms and other facilities based on their gender at birth. Daugaard issued the veto Tuesday afternoon on a bill that would have become law at midnight if he had taken no action. Opponents of the measure, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Human Rights Campaign, had called on Daugaard to veto the bill. \u201dProponents of House Bill 1008 say it protects students\u2019 privacy,\u201d South Dakota Public Radio reports.",
        "Whether or not you\u2019re a citizen in New York state, you have a right to attend a public high school and earn a diploma until you\u2019re 21. That was Pawsansoe Bree\u2019s plan after she left a refugee camp in Thailand when she was almost 19. She resettled about four hours north of New York City \u2014 in the small, Rust Belt city of Utica, N. Y. which the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees once called \u201dThe Town That Loves Refugees.\u201d Bree says she knew she had a lot of work to do when she arrived.",
        "Less than four months after it started accepting Syrian refugees, Canada says it has reached its goal of bringing in 25, 000 people who have fled the raging civil war. The initiative was a campaign promise by newly elected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He personally welcomed the first group of refugees when they started arriving in December.",
        "Chances are, you\u2019ve never heard of flubendiamide. It\u2019s not among the most toxic insecticides, and it\u2019s not among the widely used chemicals, either. In recent years, it has been used on about a quarter of the nation\u2019s tobacco and 14 percent of almonds, peppers and watermelons. But flubendiamide is now at the center of a public dispute between the Environmental Protection Agency and the company that sells it, Bayer CropScience. That dispute is arousing fear in the pesticide industry \u2014 and hope among activists who are pushing for the EPA to regulate pesticides more tightly.",
        "It was a love of mystery novels that brought Gary Shulze and Pat Frovarp together \u2014 a love of God Is a Bullet by Boston Teran, to be specific. \u201dI was looking at books,\u201d Frovarp, who is 75, tells NPR\u2019s Ari Shapiro. \u201dGary and I had seen each other.

        "We all know ancestors give us our hair color, but the roots of gray hair have been less clear. Is it genetics, or stress? Marie Antoinette supposedly went completely white the night before they lopped off her head. And our presidents seem to go gray much faster than those of us with less weighty roles. It turns out you can blame Mom and Dad, at least a bit. Scientists say they\u2019ve identified the first gene for gray hair. The variant, dubbed IRF4, is also associated with blonde or hair.",
        "Finding success in science requires smarts, determination \u2014 and sometimes a bit of luck. NPR\u2019s Skunk Bear created the Golden Mole Award For Accidental Brilliance to celebrate that last part. You sent us hundreds of stories of mistakes, coincidences and surprises that recently led to new discoveries. Last week we shared the top nominees, and we now have a winner: Elizabeth Tibbetts, a biologist at the University of Michigan. In graduate school, Tibbetts spent hours watching footage of wasp colonies, trying to understand how the insects cooperate."
