        "A handwritten will by Osama bin Laden indicates he had a fortune of \u201d about 29 million US \u201d and that most of it should be spent \u201d on Jihad, \u201d according to notes released by the U. S. Senate on Tuesday. The will was among more than 100 copies made public by the Office of the Director of National Security. The materials were captured when Navy SEALs killed the leader in a November 1, 2011, raid on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. This is the second batch of material that has been made public. The document was released last day.",
        "Marriage is breaking ground in America. According to the U. S. Census, the percentage of married adults rose from 57 percent in 2000 to 52 percent in 2009. For the first time ever, married adult women outnumber unmarried adult women in the U. S. Rebecca Traister says the high marriage rates among adult women are less about the institution of marriage and more about the benefits available to women equally. \u201d The choice not to marry isn \u2019 t exactly a conscious rejection of love, \u201d Traister tells Fresh Air \u2019 s Terry Gross.",
        "\u201d I have taken a lot of pictures because I \u2019 ve been up here for a long time, \u201d NASA astronaut Bill Kelly said during a recent press conference from the International Space Station. \u201d I \u2019 ve always taken some good photos and some memorable ones. \u201d When he returns to Earth on Tuesday morning, Kelly will have spent 340 years aboard the ISS. While that \u2019 s not quite a year, it \u2019 s still a record for an Earth astronaut, and one of the spaceflights survived. Kelly is not the only member of his team to visit the station.",
        "American astronaut Scott Kelly is back on Earth, ending his short stay on the International Space Station. Kelly and cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko, who both spent most of the past decade in space, landed at 11 : 26 p. m. ET in Kazakhstan. Cosmonaut Dmitry Volkov, who arrived on the ISS last October, also returned with Kelly and Kornienko. Kelly was lifted from the Earth and placed in a seat to enable his body to readjust to the earth \u2019 s gravity.",
        "Here \u2019 s an exercise in deductive reasoning, with implications for our food security. Fact : Insects such as bees and butterflies are required, and sometimes essential, for keeping much of our food, plus a majority of our fruits, berries and nuts. Fact : Many of these pollinators, including wild ones such as bumblebees, are in extinction. In Europe, where the phenomenon has been observed most carefully, about a third of all bee and butterfly species are extinct, and 9 percent are threatened with extinction. The seemingly logical reason? Food production will run along with the pollinators.",
        "When Samuel Smith graduated with a master \u2019 s in accounting from Cornell, he thought the $ 190, 000 in debt he incurred would pay off. But it took him a while to land loans at a software firm in Austin, Texas. And now, after paying $ 1, 750 a week in loan payments, bills and food, he says he doesn \u2019 t have much left over. He doesn \u2019 t own a TV and says \u201d it \u2019 d be nice to go out for coffee once in a while. \u201d More people have more student loan debt than at any time in life.",
        "There \u2019 s lots of evidence that getting too little exercise is associated with overeating and an increased body weight. The question is, why? Part of the answer seems to be that skimping on sugar can disrupt our circadian rhythms. Lack of exercise can also alter eating and satiety hormones. Now, a new trial finds evidence that sleep deprivation ( getting less than six hours of sleep per night ) produces large peaks of a lipid in our bloodstream known as an endocannabinoid that may make eating more pleasurable. So, what \u2019 s an endocannabinoid?",
        "On Tuesday The Rolling Stones announced the album \u2019 s upcoming performance in Havana, hailing it as a landmark occasion. The performance is slated for March 25 at the Arena Deportiva de la Habana, a centrally situated \u201d sports city \u201d Cuba. While the announcement heralds the show as \u201d the largest concert in the country by a modern Rock Band, \u201d it \u2019 s one of a much larger audience of major musicians to perform in Havana as the governments of the U. S. and Cuba begin to mend their bonds.",
        "Aubrey McClendon, the former CEO of Chesapeake Power Corp. who was charged earlier with orchestrating a conspiracy, has died in a car crash. The fatal accident occurred Wednesday morning, the Oklahoma City Police Department said on Sunday. A police spokesman announced at a news conference stated that McClendon \u2019 s car was traveling at low speed when it crashed into an overpass wall and \u201d was engulfed in flames. \u201d Sgt. Paco Balderrama said no one else was in the SUV and that police were not even able to determine whether McClendon was wearing a seat belt.",
        "It \u2019 s only March, but Inner City Health Superintendent Leana Wen already has an embarrassingly early calendar. She \u2019 s put aside the city \u2019 s plan for children with the Zika virus, launched a lawsuit against soda and other sugary beverages and conducted an investigation into why so many residents in the city are overdosing on fentanyl. Trained in emergency surgery, Wen, 33, says serving the health department in Seattle is the job she \u2019 s had. She sees herself as the city \u2019 s doctor. Each overdose death rests on her. \u201d It \u2019 s so real for me every time, \u201d Wen says. These changes are preventable.",
        "I walk up to meet Allan Kingdom at the living room door of St Paul \u2019 s Golden \u2019 s Deli, but he speaks to me first. Kingdom is very good at being first : He asks me how I \u2019 m doing before I ask him he asks me what my name is before I say it. Maybe he \u2019 s just more polite and less anxious than me, maybe it \u2019 s a combination of youthful exuberance and masculine hubris. More accurately, it \u2019 s part of his smooth, elegant, Peanut Butter Prince charm. The kind of charm that implicitly requires anointing, including oneself.",
        "The Department of Health and Human Services announces it is expanding its Head Start program in Flint, Mich. with $ 3. 6 billion in funding. It \u2019 s an effort to alleviate the developmental effects on children from the city \u2019 s water. The consequences of lead exposure are chronic and can cause \u201d learning problems, behavioral problems and mental retardation, \u201d according to the World Health Organization.

        "A bright red tablecloth adds a pop of hope to Ashara Manns \u2019 kitchen at her home in Jerusalem, Mich. The substitute teacher is at the sink, where she pours two bottles of water into a stockpot before dumping in big bags of apple greens. \u201d Normally, I would rinse these with the mineral water, so hopefully they \u2019 re relatively safe, \u201d Manns says. Local residents have been told not to drink or cook with the city \u2019 s drinking water, so Manns and her husband, Bennie, rely on bottled water to prepare their meals.",
        "Lowering the price of fruits and vegetables by 30 percent can save nearly 200, 000 lives over 15 years \u2014 roughly the population of Des Moines, Iowa. That\u2019s the message being touted by researchers this week at the American Heart Association\u2019s Epidemiology meeting in Phoenix. We know eating more fruits and vegetables is good for your heart. Now computer models suggest that making that produce more affordable may actually translate into lower death rates from heart disease and stroke.",
        "A day after he failed to crack 11 percent in any of the Super Tuesday presidential contests, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson appears to be effectively ending his campaign for president. \u201dI do not see a political path forward in light of last evening\u2019s Super Tuesday primary results,\u201d Carson said in a statement Wednesday afternoon. While Carson did not explicitly say he was dropping out, he said he will not attend Thursday\u2019s Republican debate, and that he\u2019ll \u201ddiscuss more about the future of this movement\u201d on Friday during an appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland.",
        "If voter turnout is any indicator of enthusiasm, this year\u2019s GOP voters are way, way more pumped than 2012 voters were. Democrats, meanwhile? Their excitement seems to have dimmed since 2008. Last night, more than 8. 5 million Republicans turned out to vote in the 11 GOP Super Tuesday states that reported results. That suggests far more enthusiasm than the last time Republicans picked a nominee. In those same 11 states in 2012, turnout totaled only around 4. 7 million. That makes this year\u2019s turnout in those 11 states 81 percent higher than four years ago.",
        "The name of the game is delegates in presidential politics. The race for them is on in the 2016 primary elections. Here\u2019s how each candidate has done so far and what\u2019s at stake in each state. Delegate numbers shown are maintained by the AP and provided via an automatic feed. Because some counts are unofficial or, in the case of superdelegates, are based on surveys and public endorsements, numbers shown here may differ from what is reported elsewhere.",
        "The results of the biggest voting day in the presidential contest thus far may not have been everything that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton had hoped, but they were enough to set the course for the remainder of the nominating season. And they were surely enough to intensify the pressure on their respective rivals. For believers in Bernie Sanders\u2019 promise of a \u201dpolitical revolution,\u201d Super Tuesday may have seemed like the end of a dream. And for Republican and party officials anxious about having Donald Trump as their presidential nominee, Super Tuesday must have been a nightmare.",
        "I\u2019m a retinal specialist, an ophthalmologist who specializes in the back of the eye. I see a good number of patients with macular degeneration, or AMD, a disease that limits central vision. It affects at least 6 percent of the population, and the more severe form with significant vision loss will affect about 3 million people by the year 2020. People with AMD can have trouble recognizing faces, reading, driving and navigating their everyday lives. We are constantly searching for new treatments, different ways to battle the disease and the havoc it wreaks on vision.",
        "If you\u2019ve stopped for gas lately, you\u2019ve probably noticed a price jump. A week ago, the national average for a gallon of regular gas was around $1. 70. Now it\u2019s about $1. 80, according to GasBuddy. com, which tracks prices. So rising gas prices must reflect shrinking oil supplies, right? Nope. The U. S. Energy Information Administration issued its latest \u201dpetroleum status\u201d report on Wednesday and said U. S. commercial crude oil inventories are up by 10. 4 million barrels from the previous week. That\u2019s a lot \u2014 about quadruple what most analysts had predicted in a Platts poll.",
        "In central Cairo, Ali Sayed Ismail Hussein sits on a wooden chair in the street in front of his dead son\u2019s apartment building. A recording of the Quran plays in the background as neighbors and friends pass by to pay condolences. \u201dThe blood of my son, Mohammed Darbaka, is on the neck of the president of the republic,\u201d Hussein says, speaking of his son, Mohammed Ali, known to most by his nickname, Darbaka. \u201dI am asking for the rights of my son from the president. My demand is justice for my son.\u201d The shooting took place Feb. 18.",
        "When a whooping crane stands up, you notice. At 5 feet in height, it\u2019s America\u2019s tallest bird. Its wingspan is more than 7 feet, its body snowy white, its wingtips jet black. By the 1940s, the birds had nearly gone extinct. Biologists have worked hard to bring them back, by breeding whoopers in captivity and releasing them in the wild. There are now several small wild populations in the U. S. Perhaps the most remarkable is the eastern group.",
        "As Donald Trump delivered his Super Tuesday victory speech to reporters, his most prominent endorser, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, stood behind him, prompting a deluge of tweets comparing the former presidential candidate to a hostage. Christie\u2019s secretly conceived decision last week to endorse Trump has provoked shock, anger and disappointment from all corners. After Christie refused to take questions about Trump at a news conference at the statehouse in Trenton on Monday, six New Jersey newspapers from the Gannett company penned a joint editorial saying Christie should be recalled for ignoring the people of the state.",
        "The local media are calling it the \u201dRobin Hood\u201d budget. The government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, eager to win support among the urban and rural poor, is announcing programs to improve conditions for people and provide tax breaks for necessities and items that might improve their lives. Meanwhile, to bring in more funds for government spending, there are now higher taxes for luxury items. Farmers in particular are getting a helping hand \u2014 and that\u2019s a smart political calculus, because Modi needs their support to win in 2019.",
        "Comic Louie Anderson has had a hugely successful career for the past 30 years, but he admits he wasn\u2019t a very good actor early on. \u201dI didn\u2019t know who I was or how to do it,\u201d he tells Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross. Now, at 62, Anderson is delivering a standout performance on the FX comedy series Baskets. In it, he plays Christine Baskets, the mother of an embittered rodeo clown (played by Zach Galifianakis).

        "After hearing oral arguments on what could be one of the most important abortion cases decided by the U. S. Supreme Court in decades, NPR\u2019s Nina Totenberg says that the only thing that is certain is that Justice Anthony Kennedy will cast the deciding vote. As expected, Nina says, the three conservatives and four liberals on the court stuck to their positions for and against a Texas law that puts restrictions on abortions.",
        "The U. S. Supreme Court dealt a blow Tuesday to nascent efforts to track the quality and cost of health care, ruling that a 1974 law precludes states from requiring that every health care claim involving their residents be submitted to a massive database. The arguments were arcane, but the effect is clear: We\u2019re a long way off from having a true picture of the country\u2019s health care spending, especially differences in the way hospitals treat patients and doctors practice medicine.",
        "Removing any doubt about whether you\u2019re allowed to puff away on an electronic cigarette while airborne, the Department of Transportation has explicitly banned vaping on commercial flights. The department had previously said that it understood its \u201dban on smoking of tobacco to be sufficiently broad to include the use of electronic cigarettes.\u201d It\u2019s the word \u201dsmoking\u201d that was seen as a possible loophole. As most any user will emphatically tell you, they don\u2019t view it as smoking because there\u2019s no smoke \u2014 the device releases vapor instead. U. S.",
        "It\u2019s been only a year and a half since the social protest movement around police violence commonly referred to as Black Lives Matter emerged as a major political force.

        "Hear that change jingling in my pocket? Good. I have two little questions for you. I have a quarter, a dime and a nickel. How much money DO I have? I have three coins. How much money COULD I have? The first question is a basic arithmetic problem with one and only one right answer. You might find it on a test. The second is an question with a set of different possible correct answers. It would lend itself to a debate over the details: Are these all American coins? Are any of them counterfeit?"
