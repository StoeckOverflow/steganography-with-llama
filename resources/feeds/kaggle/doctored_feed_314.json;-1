        "There \u2019 s a first vote for everything. That \u2019 s certainly especially true in this campaign launched by Donald Trump. And Republicans opposed to Trump are beginning to abandon the idea that Marco Rubio ( or anyone else ) can receive a majority of delegates before the next round of balloting at this summer \u2019 s GOP convention in Cleveland, where the party will later pick its nominee.",
        "Conservative analysts and consultants are racing to fix what would be the worst strategic mistakes so far in the presidential election \u2014 the nearly total inability of other candidates and their allies to rival frontrunner Donald Trump. Opposing superPACs took just $ 1. 3 million attacking Obama in the seven months from May 2015, when he announced, to December, when he led the polls. In July, there was no opposition at all. Only when the Iowa caucuses loomed did the losses accelerate, to $ 4. 4 million in January and $ 9. 4 million in February. Meanwhile, the attacks concentrated on Iowa.",
        "Republican President Trump released a motion to change the country \u2019 s medical care system that uses several familiar GOP rivals and one that puts him in competition with, believe it or not, Democratic leader Bernie Sanders. Right off the bat, Trump voted for the elimination of the Affordable Care Act, ringing the repeal campaign that has been popular among a large swath of Republicans and that has fueled thousands of votes to overturn Obamacare in Congress, yet another failed campaign when lawmakers reconvened first thing in January.",
        "Flint, Mich. isn \u2019 t the only big city with a lead lab. Though the health concern in Flint has highlighted the dangers of lead in water treatment, author David Rosner tells Fresh Air \u2019 s Mark Gross that lead, which is a neurotoxin, can be present throughout the U. S. on soil, in soil and in the air. \u201d The issue with lead is that it \u2019 s now really safe, and we \u2019 ve created a terribly safe environment in all sorts of conditions, \u201d he says. Lead is especially dangerous to young children.",
        "Fulfilling the vision of her life, Esperanza Spalding played the music of her upcoming album Emily \u2019 s D + Evolution in concert at BRIC House in Rochester, N. Y. on Thursday, July 3. WFUV and NPR Music posted a live video webstream of the song as part of the First Love Live series. Emily \u2019 s D + Evolution marks a signature sound for Spalding. Here, she picks up the double bass ( and occasionally the guitar ) and surrounds herself with a power combination of electric guitar and sings \u2014 a louder, proggier, weirder direction for the performer and vocalist.",
        "A team of athletes will compete alongside teams representing their home nation at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, the International Olympic Committee has hosted. Previously, athletes who did not represent a country were not allowed to compete.",
        "Nearly of children on SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, still have to visit a food pantry to keep themselves busy, according to data released this week by the U. S. Department of Agriculture. In 2014, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program supported 23 million rural households. The same year, 32 percent of all households who received SNAP in the previous 30 days reported they had used a food pantry, the USDA says.",
        "Allegations of sexual abuse against Bill Cosby as well as intensified focus on campus crime have left many universities struggling to figure out legal ways to right old wrongs. Now, a growing number of states are changing their statutes of limitation to allow sexual assault cases to be prosecuted annually and even decades after the accident. \u201d We have to keep the door open for justice for survivors, \u201d says Rebecca O \u2019 Connor from the Rape, Abuse And Incest Watch Network. State statutes of limitations currently extend from 3 to 30 years.",
        "By now, you might have forgotten that NPR Music has selected a winner for the 2016 Tiny Desk Contest. The haunting violin tone and melody of Gaelynn Lea \u2019 s album \u201d Someday We \u2019 ll Linger In The Sun \u201d stood out as our readers viewed the roughly 6, 100 submitted submissions. Lea is used to making music in her hometown of Duluth, Minn. but every week, she \u2019 ll play at Dave Boilen \u2019 s desk here at NPR. She recently joined NPR \u2019 s Audie Cornish to discuss her unique style of playing and the inspiration behind the song she submitted to the judges.",
        "There were 6, 100 entries in this week \u2019 s Tiny Desk Contest, representing every state in the country. We asked you to send us a video of an original recording, behind a desk of your choice. We didn \u2019 t care much about the content of the video or even the title. We wanted something real, a song and a sound that sounded original and a performance that really inspired.",
        "The legal argument over whether Apple should be allowed to help the FBI hack into the database used by one of the officers in San Bernardino is making headlines in the U. S. But it \u2019 s just one skirmish in a broader global sense : American tech companies are feeling similar concerns from law enforcement officers around the world, and they believe the lack of international compliance standards is creating a crisis. Just this week, a similar raid in Brazil resulted in the double arrest of one of Facebook \u2019 s Latin America players.",
        "Elvis Presley is not part of any nonprofit or government agency. He \u2019 s just a guy with a beard and tattooed arms who started a GoFundMe project last spring so he could build tiny shelters for homeless people to live in. He got the idea after befriending a homeless woman in his neighborhood. \u201d It just happens to me, you know, I \u2019 m just like, you know, everybody in this neighborhood likes you, they like you, \u201d he says. \u201d Why does everyone give a crap that you \u2019 re lying in the dirt?",
        "First, it\u2019s not really black. It\u2019s not even a color or a pigment. \u201dVantablack\u201d is a \u201dmaterial,\u201d according to Surrey NanoSystems, the British company that created it. But this growling, rebellious material is causing quite a fuss now that renowned sculptor Anish Kapoor \u2014 who designed Chicago\u2019s Cloud Gate and the Orbit tower for the 2012 London Olympics \u2014 has bought the exclusive rights to use it in art. If you want the official explanation of what Vantablack is, check out the company\u2019s FAQ.",
        "In 1933, an effervescent comedy called Design for Living gave us two men and a woman living cozily together as roommates, no sex. But when that boundary starts to break down, the woman, played by Miriam Hopkins, points out an inequity: \u201dA man can meet two, three or even four women and fall in love with all of them and then by a process of interesting elimination, he\u2019s able to decide which one he prefers.",
        "Holy Ghost is a split record Modern Baseball shares with itself, meaning that Jake Ewald and Brendan Lukens each get a side (A and B, respectively) to do their respective thing. Okay, okay, but when OutKast split a record between songwriters, the pair only returned to do reunion shows \u2014 and we\u2019re all still bitter about it. But, hey, if that\u2019s what these Philly want to do, we can\u2019t stop them, just hope they keep on keepin\u2019 on.",
        "The most recent Republican presidential nominee is taking shots at Donald Trump\u2019s fitness to be president. And he\u2019s not mincing his words. Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, called the current GOP \u201da phony, a fraud\u201d in a speech Thursday morning in Salt Lake City. And he didn\u2019t stop there. Romney described Trump as \u201da con artist\u201d whose demeanor is \u201drecklessness in the extreme.\u201d As for Trump\u2019s record as a \u201dhuge business success\u201d? \u201dNo, he isn\u2019t.\u201d And when it comes to Trump\u2019s prescriptions to bring back jobs from China and Japan?",
        "House Speaker Paul Ryan said he \u201dlaughed out loud\u201d at Donald Trump\u2019s Super Tuesday comment that the Wisconsin Republican would \u201dpay a big price\u201d if he couldn\u2019t work with him. \u201dSometimes, reality is stranger than fiction around here these days,\u201d Ryan told reporters at his weekly press conference. The speaker said he watched Trump\u2019s comments from his office. Trump did not elaborate on his Ryan comment. Ryan has publicly rebuked Trump twice during this presidential nomination contest \u2014 first, for calling for a ban on Muslims entering the U. S.",
        "We know we should put the cigarettes away or make use of that gym membership, but in the moment, we just don\u2019t do it. There is a cluster of neurons in our brain critical for motivation, though. What if you could hack them to motivate yourself? These neurons are located in the middle of the brain, in a region called the ventral tegmental area. A paper published Thursday in the journal Neuron suggests that we can activate the region with a little bit of training.",
        "Berta C\u00e1ceres, a hugely influential Honduran indigenous rights activist, was killed in her hometown of La Esperenza, Intibuc\u00e1, on Thursday. She would have turned 46 tomorrow.

It\u2019s also the first debate since last week\u2019s raucous in Houston. Here are four big things we\u2019ll be watching for tonight: What Will Marco Rubio Do?

        "Over at the New York Times Magazine, Jay Caspian Kang recently had a really sharp essay on protests by over the conviction of Peter Liang, the New York City police officer who was involved in the 2014 fatal shooting of unarmed Akai Gurley, an unarmed black man. Protesters have called Liang a \u201dscapegoat,\u201d pointing out that many white officers involved in previous killings of unarmed black men have not faced similar consequences. In fact, as Kang notes, Liang is \u201dthe first N. Y. P. D.",
        "Oscar hopefuls strode down the red carpet on Sunday \u2014 walking advertisements for some of fashion\u2019s biggest names. But Chanel and Armani weren\u2019t the only winners that night. A brand that targets more modest, socially conscious consumers got attention, too. It started when Ghanaian actor Abraham Attah showed up on the red carpet. Many eyes went from his sharp tux right to his feet. Yes, the teenage star of Beasts of No Nation was wearing black velvet Toms. Many of you probably know Toms. Maybe you\u2019re wearing a pair right now.",
        "Note: NPR\u2019s First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the Spotify playlist at the bottom of the page. As one of the two guitarists and principal songwriters in the Denton, Texas, bands The Marked Men and Radioactivity, Mark Ryan indulges his gifts for melodic punk and respectively. But his band Mind Spiders seems to act as the warehouse in which Ryan stores his other obsessions: vaguely tightly wound, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, set off by dual drummers and the occasional synth.",
        "The Zika virus has sparked international alarm largely because of fears that the pathogen is causing microcephaly, a condition in which babies are born with unusually small heads and damaged brains. But the preliminary results of a study released Friday suggest Zika can also cause other potentially grave complications for fetuses carried by women who get infected while they are pregnant. \u201dThere seems to be a whole spectrum of conditions that are related to this \u2014 not only microcephaly,\u201d says Karin a professor of clinical pediatrics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA who led the study.",
        "It\u2019s nearly impossible to see some of the earliest movies by filmmakers. Many have been lost or destroyed. Those that have survived are often held by private collectors or stored away in old film archives. More than a dozen of those movies, though, are now part of a film restoration project \u2014 Pioneers of Cinema \u2014 by independent film distributor Kino Lorber. The project focuses on a genre called \u201drace films\u201d \u2014 movies made after World War I and through the 1940s by black filmmakers with mostly black casts for black audiences.",
        "Parenting can be an journey. And one bump along the road is that horrible feeling that comes over you when you see your baby break out in hives after eating a particular food \u2014 say, peanuts \u2014 for the first time. (One of my three kids gave me that kind of scare.) The concern is real. Between 1997 and 2008, the incidence of peanut and tree nut allergies nearly tripled, according to one published study. Now, there\u2019s a growing consensus about how to prevent peanut allergies in kids who are at high risk.",
        "Republican Ben Carson confirmed during his speech at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference that he is ending his bid for the White House. The famed neurosurgeon had implied he was dropping out on Wednesday after a disappointing Super Tuesday finish, and he skipped Thursday night\u2019s debate in his hometown of Detroit. But it took him more than 10 minutes into his meandering speech to a packed CPAC crowd to actually say the words \u2014 sort of.",

The results surprised scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Oregon State University, who conducted the experiment.",
        "When comedian Rachel Bloom won a best actress Golden Globe this year for Crazy the TV show she stars in and she told the crowd: \u201dWe almost didn\u2019t have a show. We made a pilot for another network and they rejected it. And we sent the pilot to every other network in Hollywood and we got six rejections in one day and we felt like crap. But we knew it was good.\u201d Eventually, Crazy found a home at the CW, which premiered the show\u2019s first season last fall. The follows a mess of a young woman named Rebecca Bunch."
