        "The GOP may be in the process of an identity crisis, but the Democratic Party is also experiencing a political crisis that may be made a lot worse if it doesn \u2019 t win the White House in November. Part of President Obama \u2019 s legacy is the history of his party. He \u2019 s had many failures in office \u2014 health care reform, climate change regulations, Wall Street reform \u2014 but his legacy will eventually include one notable failure : a diminished Democratic Party.",
        "Many would tell pollsters and politicians that they \u2019 re hopeful. Why? At least part of the information might be tucked within the February jobs book, released Friday by the Justice Department. Consider this : On the one hand, the report was brimming with bad economic news. It found employers added 242, 000 workers last month, topping most forecasts. It also showed major revisions for job growth in October and December. The unemployment rate held steady at 4. 9 percent and the labor force growth rate rose by 0. 2 percentage point to 62.",

        "Republican Rep. Marco Rubio says Donald Trump is a \u201d con man \u201d who ripped off ordinary skin and now wants to steal \u201d our territory. \u201d The Florida senator famously said, in a debate Friday night, along with all of his friends, that he will support Trump if the incumbent wins the Republican Primary. How could both statements actually be true? As an answer, we have Rubio \u2019 s somber face, and also an example from others. \u201d You \u2019 ve just described the quandary that we \u2019 re in, \u201d Rubio told me yesterday on Morning Edition. \u201d I know Hillary Clinton \u2019 s a danger to our country, too....",
        "Something is left in the Republican Party that has not survived in living memory. The power of unity, tradition, power and hierarchy is breaking even over one man who personifies the feeling of disruption. Donald Trump \u2019 s inexorable advance toward the Republican presidential nomination has split the party. This divide is not like the garden variety party fights of recent decades. It goes beyond the political squabbles of the party \u2019 s postwar generation ( center versus conservative, moderate versus conservative, eastern versus progressive ).",
        "Not even the best political forecasters could have expected that Donald Trump \u2019 s body and genitalia size would influence 2016 presidential campaign promises. But they have, and it \u2019 s thanks in large part to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Rubio insulted Trump on the election trail last Monday by claiming the business mogul has \u201d two hands \u201d \u2014 and by implying that it applied to other parts of Trump \u2019 s administration. And while many have criticized Rubio for letting down the tone of the nation \u2019 s abortion debate, he defended his speech Friday morning.",

        "Last day, a woman and NPR News reached out with an unusual person. She asked me to help find her sister, who \u2019 d vanished in the countryside of Yunnan province in northern China. \u201d My little sister has been missing since Dec. 23, 2013, \u201d the woman wrote in an interview. \u201d She married a farmer in a nearby village and was abused by her father shortly after her marriage.

        "Zootopia is both an animated charmer and a cartoon world that \u2019 s precisely what it sounds like : an anthropomorphic utopia where animals have overcome the divide to live in isolation, in ecologically distinct districts. Disney animators have conjured up in gratifyingly intricate detail a Tundra Square, Sahara Square, even a village for mice and moles. Our favorite is country rabbit Alice Hopps ( voice of Ginnifer Goodwin ) who dreams of joining the police department, though even her colleagues think she \u2019 s too small, too tough, too to deal with trouble in hell. And there is trouble in paradise.",
        "One month after congressional lawmakers grilled the FBI chief and Apple \u2019 s top team about government \u2019 s access to encrypted documents, another smaller, highly spotlighted panel convened on Capitol Hill \u2014 to tackle the issue of the government \u2019 s warrantless geolocation tracking. The arguments aren \u2019 t exactly similar. In Obama \u2019 s legal clash with the FCC, at stake is the scope of Congress \u2019 s power to compel the cooperation of an emerging tech company to gain access to encrypted information. Here, the question is how easy it should be for law enforcement to track someone \u2019 s location.",

        "Cancer dogma holds that most malignancies are caused by DNA mutations inside the nuclei of cells, mutations that ultimately lead to runaway cellular proliferation. Given the countless genetic blips that have been associated with various cancers, the illness has actually come to be seen as a complex of diseases for which personalized treatments might offer the best chances of success. But prevailing oncology orthodoxy has its detractors, and some cancer biologists feel that while mutations are nearly ubiquitous in cancer, they may not always be the driving force for disease.",
        "Last week it was all about the #OscarsSoWhite controversy. That was about racism. This week, social media erupted over something that has long been an issue within the black community. Colorism \u2014 the idea that your skin tone and not only your race determines your opportunities. Actress Zoe Saldana faced a firestorm over her portrayal of music and civil rights icon Nina Simone.
