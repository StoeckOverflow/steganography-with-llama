The teammate reported him to an agent who floated the notion of playing in China. \u201d I was wondering, \u2019 China?! \u2019 \u201d Martin said. \u201d Are we talking about the same place? \u201d At the time, the Chinese Super Kings barely registered as a blip on American soccer radar and no one had ever played overseas in the league.",

        "The first few rounds of the Democratic debate on Florida between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders were quite cordial. But that didn \u2019 t last long. Taking place in Flint, Mich. the town that has been thrust into the national spotlight following its water crisis, the winning candidates took questions from the audience about their plans to flood the heavily city county and restore clean water to all its residents. But as the debate went on, the two rivals had one of their testiest exchanges yet as politics moved to trade unions, the auto bailout, Michigan \u2019 s fragile economy and gun rights.",
        "The seventh floor debate stood in marked contrast to the GOP debate in Colorado : It focused heavily on the legal situation and it was civil. Clinton offered nuanced explanations, while Sanders offered declarative statements. An explanation : Clinton explained the five conditions she would bring to OK fracking. Sanders ended with one sentence : \u201d I don \u2019 t like fracking. \u201d Clinton had a moment when she equated gun manufacturers to Wall Street greed : \u201d The gun manufacturers want guns to make as much money as they can make. \u201d Sanders had his own when he challenged Clinton on using her Wall Street position.",

Powell spoke in an interview with NPR \u2019 s Michel Levin on All Things Considered. Referring to the \u201d civility \u201d and \u201d lack of any nastiness \u201d he brought in Ronald Reagan, Powell, who served as Reagan \u2019 s national security adviser, decried the effectiveness of the current Republican presidential campaign.",
        "Sen. Bernie Sanders has won the Democratic caucuses in Massachusetts, a victory that means he \u2019 ll be bringing home most of the state \u2019 s 25 seats at stake. With nearly all of the state \u2019 s precincts reporting, Sanders led rival Hillary Clinton by double digits, with more than 64 percent of the vote. \u201d I thank the voters of Maine for their strong efforts.

With all sources reporting, the Florida Senator took 71 percent of the votes, followed by Donald Trump at 13 percent, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at 9 percent and Ohio Gov. John Kasich with just 1 point.

        "On the surface, Houston \u2019 s election results remain divided. After all, on the GOP side Santa Cruz and Donald Trump each won two contests, while among Democrats it was Bernie Sanders who won two of the night \u2019 s debates as Hillary Clinton netted one victory. But in the march toward the nomination, delegates are the center of the game, and both the Texas governor and the former secretary of State emerged with more of them on Saturday, contributing to their margins of victory.",

        "If you \u2019 ve been following the Obama campaign, you have probably heard some talk about the power of the Democratic vote. Pastor Jim Lucado is a prominent evangelical minister and a prolific writer who nearly never writes about politics. And that \u2019 s one reason millions found a recent article of his so interesting. Lucado took to his reading to describe all the reasons he called Republican Donald Trump \u2019 s tone and decorum fail the decency level, in a blog post titled \u201d Decency for President. \u201d He cites Trump \u2019 s belittling of women and people with cancer, among other people, and his writing.",
        "Former first lady Nancy Reagan died Sunday at her residence in Los Angeles of congestive heart failure, according to the Ford Foundation. She was 94. Like most white ladies, Nancy Reagan was the target of both praise and criticism. She brought an elegance to the White House that some thought was long overdue.

Reagan was criticized for meddling in White House affairs, but she was also credited with her \u201d Just Say No \u201d campaign against drug abuse.",

The elegant, famously adoring wife off Ronald Reagan is being remembered by political figures and everyday Americans for her character, her advocacy work and her unflagging support for her husband \u2014 as well as, in some cases, for more controversial elements of her legacy. Here\u2019s a sample from the tributes released in the world of politics: Former president George W. Bush: \u201dMrs. Reagan was fiercely loyal to her beloved husband, and that devotion was matched only by her devotion to our country.",
        "This story is part of NPR\u2019s series, Break It Down. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will face off in the Michigan primary on Tuesday, at a time when the state\u2019s major cities have seen better days. Flint faces a crisis, while Detroit is still reeling from its bankruptcy. Sanders attacked Clinton on Twitter this week, connecting Clinton\u2019s support for free trade, specifically the North American Free Trade Agreement signed into law by her husband, to the kind of blight Detroit and other cities in the Upper Midwest are seeing. But is it that simple?",
        "How many Donald Trump jokes can be made in one night? Let the Gridiron Club count the ways. The D. C. journalism and political establishments gathered on Saturday night to make fun of themselves and an increasingly unpredictable presidential campaign at the Gridiron Club and Foundation\u2019s 131st Anniversary Spring Dinner.

        "There\u2019s a sales tax exemption for treating erectile dysfunction in Wisconsin. The same can\u2019t be said for feminine hygiene products. Sales tax isn\u2019t applied to Viagra in Wisconsin, but it is applied to tampons and pads. Birth control, medicated condoms and yeast infection medication are exempt because they are considered drugs. One lawmaker in that state says the taboo around menstruation that prevents women from openly talking about their periods may also explain why women are paying extra to manage those periods. \u201dWomen\u2019s health has been misunderstood and neglected throughout history,\u201d Rep.",

The story of his change of heart \u2014 brought to our attention by Bob Collins of Minnesota Public Radio \u2014 starts last August, when Ingraham reported on a USDA ranking of the \u201dnatural amenities\u201d of every community in the United States.

        "President Obama has been talking about closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, since he ran for president in 2008. Now, eight years later, his administration has put out a plan to make it happen. The plan is to transfer some of the remaining detainees to other countries and those who can\u2019t be transferred would be moved to a facility in the U. S. And that\u2019s the part of the plan many in Congress are railing against. It\u2019s not just lawmakers who don\u2019t like the president\u2019s plan.",

Manning is stepping away from the game after winning his second Super Bowl and after 18 seasons. \u201dWhen you look at everything Peyton has accomplished as a player and person, it\u2019s easy to see how fortunate we\u2019ve been to have him on our team,\u201d John Elway, Broncos Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager, said in a statement.",
        "Some of the best coffee beans in the world are grown in Africa, and while the number of coffee consumers there is growing, most Africans still don\u2019t drink it. That\u2019s something Rwanda\u2019s government would like to change. The country\u2019s coffee industry, which nearly collapsed after the genocide in 1994, has gradually become one of its largest and most profitable agricultural exports. Rwanda exports 99 percent of its coffee. Now, the government wants to increase the domestic market \u2014 mostly by tapping into the expendable cash of Rwanda\u2019s growing middle class.",
        "Forget all that stuff. If you\u2019re looking for evidence that the British have a big, beating heart underneath their reputation for reserve and restraint, look no further than Sunday\u2019s finale of their popular TV export, Downton Abbey. It\u2019s a sprawling, affair which wraps up six seasons worth of storylines.

        "If you\u2019ve ever watched the television show Downton Abbey, you\u2019ve probably deduced that dining was a very, very big deal in the lives of the landed gentry of Edwardian England. Much of the drama surrounding the aristocratic Crawley family and their servants unfolds against a tableau of the table. Beaus jostle for the attention of the earl\u2019s eldest daughter while eating elbow to elbow. An engagement is publicly renewed during the evening meal. The butler works himself into an exhausted tizzy trying to keep up appearances without enough footmen to serve dishes in \u201dproper\u201d style. And the food itself?",

        "Padma Lakshmi is probably best known as the host of the TV show Top Chef on Bravo, but she\u2019s also worked as a model and an actress. Lakshmi was born in India, and moved to America to be with her mother, who\u2019d moved to the States after the breakup of her arranged marriage. Raised between two countries, she developed a love of food and family. And then, in her 20s, she met and fell in love with the author Salman Rushdie. \u201dHe\u2019s an extremely brilliant and charming and layered and complicated man,\u201d she tells NPR\u2019s Rachel Martin.",
        "NPR\u2019s Rachel Martin spoke with Martin Molin, creator of the marble machine, on Weekend Edition Sunday. You can hear their conversation at the audio link. The \u201dMarble Machine\u201d is a musical instrument by way of a Rube Goldberg contraption, the love child of a barrel organ, a kick drum, a vibraphone and a bass \u2014 all powered by gears and 2, 000 steel marbles.

        "At Sunday night\u2019s Democratic debate in Flint, Mich. the candidates spent a considerable amount of time talking about that city\u2019s water crisis, as lead poisoning continues to affect Flint\u2019s majority black population. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders also spent a lot of time talking about race and disparities endemic to the black community. At one point toward the end of the debate, CNN\u2019s Don Lemon asked both candidates to talk about any \u201dracial blind spots\u201d they might have. Both seemed to give thoughtful answers, but one particular line from Sanders drew rebuke.",
        "In their seventh debate, this time in Flint, Mich. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders agreed on the root causes of that city\u2019s drinking water crisis. They both called for a massive federal intervention and investigation of the lead poisoning there and urged that the state\u2019s Republican governor, Rick Snyder, either resign or be recalled. But the two Democratic candidates also clashed over the role of trade deals in the deterioration of Michigan\u2019s economy, the usefulness of the Bank and the state of manufacturing in America generally.",
        "You\u2019ve probably heard of ugly fruits and veggies. They may not be pretty, but they\u2019re still perfectly tasty and nutritious. And there are lots of efforts to keep these cosmetically challenged foods (think gnarled carrots, or funky, misshapen apples) from landing in the landfill because they don\u2019t meet retailers\u2019 beauty standards. As awareness of massive food waste grows (we toss out enough food to fill 44 skyscrapers each year) two major retailers now say they\u2019re ready to experiment with sales of produce that may otherwise be wasted.",
        "Depression prompts people to make about 8 million doctors\u2019 appointments a year, and more than half are with primary care physicians. A study suggests those doctors often fall short in treating depression because of insurance issues, time constraints and other factors. More often than not, primary care doctors fail to teach patients how to manage their care and don\u2019t follow up to see how they\u2019re doing, according to the study, which was published Monday in Health Affairs. Those are considered effective tactics for treating chronic illnesses."
