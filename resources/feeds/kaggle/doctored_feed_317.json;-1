        "The standoff, where Apple is unable to write special documents that would help Apple crack into an iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters, is usually viewed as a battle between privacy and security. At the congressional hearing on encryption last June, FBI Director Bob Comey argued that increasingly complex encryption is making smartphones \u201d warrantproof. \u201d FCC \u2019 s General Counsel Jim Sewell testified that complying with the FBI \u2019 s requests would create a dangerous tool that the bad people could abuse.",
        "In 1927, the U. S. Supreme Court decided, by a majority of 8 to 1, to uphold a state \u2019 s right to genetically sterilize a person considered unfit to procreate. The decision, known as Buck v. Bell, centered on a pregnant woman named Marion Buck, whom the state of Georgia had deemed to be \u201d feebleminded. \u201d Author David Cohen tells Dead Air \u2019 s Terry Miller that Buck v. Bell was considered a victory for California \u2019 s eugenics movement, an early 20th Century school of thought that opposed biological determinism and actively trying to \u201d breed out \u201d traits that were deemed undesirable.",
        "\u201d The idiot is not our biggest problem. He is indeed loathsome.... Nonetheless, he lives his life and is happy. He does not continue the race with a handful of children like himself.... It is the moron thing that makes for us our greatest problem. \u201d Henry H. Goddard, 1912, A hundred years ago being called a moron would get you deported or admitted to an insane asylum. You would have thanked psychologist Henry H. Goddard for your advice. Goddard, a researcher, was gifted with intelligence. He introduced a model for it to the United States.",
        "The National Park Service wants you to reach out into nature. But the success of movies like the National Park Service \u2019 s Find Your Hero and others from state government offices has created a great demand. Last month, a record 305 million Americans visited national parks. As the Park Service wants to point out, that \u2019 s more people than tickets to every single amusement park, NFL, MLB and MLB game and auto race combined.",
        "I don \u2019 t know if you \u2019 d understand, but we at Rx Dose have been noticing that the world looks like an increasingly busy place, full of chaos and chaos but bearing onto an endless supply of leftfield players. Has this always been the case, and we would have more access to the information that spotlights our future state? ( Because Internet. ) Or is it just the end of the modern times?",
        "The U. S. District Court, without hearing oral argument, has also reversed an Alabama Supreme Court ruling that extended parental rights to a female adoptive mother who had split with her parents. The decision is a direct repudiation of an earlier Supreme Court decision that refused to recognize a single adoption. The two women in the case were together for 16 months, and they had three children adopted by assisted reproductive services \u2014 an older daughter, now 13, and boy and girl twins, now 11. The birth names of the parents have not been disclosed.",
        "Former Mayor of New York Governor Michael Bloomberg announced Monday he will not run for governor, after months of speculation that he might jump in as in independent during a campaign in which it seems anything could happen. In a column on his news site Bloomberg Today, he said looking at the polls made it \u201d clear to me that if I left the race, I could not run. \u201d He added that he feared his race could split wide enough to give either Trump or Ted Turner an advantage.",

        "A jury convicted Fox sportscaster Erin Andrews $ 55 million Monday in a successful lawsuit she filed against a renovated Marriott hotel after a stalker filmed her talking through her door \u2019 s peephole in 2008.

        "The Marshall Court is on an unlikely mission \u2014 perhaps to press India, France and the United Kingdom to stop their nuclear programs. The Hawaiian archipelago, which was the site of dozens of U. S. nuclear tests in the \u2019 40s and \u2019 50s, is suing the three countries in the U. N. \u2019 s International Court of Justice. The Marshall Plan says the three countries haven \u2019 t carried out in good faith their obligations to pursue policies leading to nuclear disarmament. It seems the U. K. is obligated to do so because it is a signatory to the Lisbon Treaty.",

        "Super Bowl winning quarterback Peyton Manning, 39, announced his retirement Monday at a news conference in Englewood, Colo. A visibly emotional Manning shared an anecdote from his first of 18 seasons in the NFL, when he had a chance to shake the hand of legendary quarterback Johnny Unitas after a tough loss to the Baltimore Ravens. Choking up as he remembered the exchange, Manning said: \u201dHe told me, \u2019Peyton, you stay at it, I\u2019m pulling for you.\u2019 \u201d \u201dI hope that old No.",
        "There are nine spare, simple songs on Julien Baker\u2019s debut album, Sprained Ankle, and every one of them is sad. In fact, she came to the Tiny Desk with an untitled new one \u2014 since given the name \u201dFuneral Pyre\u201d \u2014 and she appropriately introduced it as \u201dSad Song #11.\u201d But Baker\u2019s shimmering picking, the purity of her voice and the yearning way she sings make each of her songs lovely and memorable rather than merely somber.",

The weekend strikes hit an training camp about 120 miles north of the capital, Mogadishu, NPR\u2019s Tom Bowman reports. Here\u2019s more from Tom: \u201dA Pentagon spokesman, Capt.

        "Pick a farm trend in the past decade and urban agriculture is likely to top the list. But for all the timely appeal of having a little house on the urban prairie, the practice often raises a simple question: Can anyone earn a living doing it? The answer: Not by much, according to a new survey of 370 urban farmers across the U. S. published this month in the British Food Journal. But researchers suggest that the modest profit to be had might not be as big of a downside as you think.",
        "The presidential primaries are a great opportunity to test your skills in political prediction. Who will win which states, and by what margin? And if your predictions aren\u2019t all that good, how can you do better? Two weeks ago, I wrote about how to make better predictions in domains both big (world politics) and small (your breakfast) drawing on recent work in psychological science. Today, I\u2019m going to revisit this question from a new angle. Making good predictions isn\u2019t just about your accuracy it\u2019s also about your calibration. Accuracy refers to just what you probably expect.",

The radio interview above and the story below originally ran in 2009, when Tomlinson spoke with NPR\u2019s Guy Raz about selecting the @ sign to be part of digital communication, sending gibberish to test the system and not becoming an Internet billionaire.

        "Soon after its launch in 1986, the satirical magazine Spy picked Donald Trump as the brash embodiment of a crass age. Founded by Graydon Carter and Kurt Andersen, the magazine chronicled New York\u2019s obsessions with wealth and social status, zeroing in on Trump\u2019s questionable business dealings (of which there were many) and his outlandish personal traits (of which there were perhaps even more). Carter is now editor of Vanity Fair, and Kurt Andersen is a novelist and host of Public Radio International and WNYC\u2019s nationally syndicated show Studio 360.",
        "I can\u2019t say I ever expected to be writing about Donald Trump, Republican frontrunner, back when I was writing about Donald Trump, guy. It\u2019s one of the weirdest things about having someone who\u2019s so in one arena move into another: in most news organizations, the people who have followed Trump the most closely for the longest time cover television or maybe business, but not politics.",
        "The results from Tuesday\u2019s four primary and caucus states are in: three wins for Trump, one each for Clinton and Cruz, and one surprising, narrow victory for Sanders. Bernie Sanders\u2019 tight win over Hillary Clinton in Michigan is the biggest news out of Tuesday night\u2019s presidential nomination races. Though Clinton had led consistently in recent polls, Sanders won by less than 2 percentage points with 99 percent of precincts reporting. Clinton won easily in Mississippi earlier in the evening. On the Republican side, Donald Trump won in Hawaii, Michigan and Mississippi, and Ted Cruz won Idaho.",

        "For more than a century, mug shots have helped police catch criminals. Those photos of a person\u2019s face and profile trace their roots to Paris in the late 19th century. Now, some of the earliest mug shots ever taken are on display at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The photos were once on the cutting edge of how police identified suspects. They were taken by a French criminologist named Alphonse Bertillon, and his techniques set the template that police use today.",
        "For Barbara Radley, there is \u201dbefore\u201d and \u201dafter.\u201d Before was when she could work \u2014 moving furniture, and driving a truck. \u201dIt was nothing for me to throw a couch on my back and carry it up a flight of stairs,\u201d says the from Oshkosh, Wis. Then there\u2019s after. After she herniated five disks in her back. And after, she says, her blood pressure medicine destroyed her pancreas. Now Radley is disabled, suffering from diabetes, liver failure and scleroderma. And she is bankrupt. \u201dWell, the medical bills were just piling up,\u201d Radley tells Shots. \u201dWe couldn\u2019t handle it.",
        "When James Corden took over The Late Late Show one year ago, the question on everyone\u2019s mind was, \u201dJames who?\u201d He was big in the U. K. In the U. S. he had starred in the movie Into the Woods and won a Tony for the play One Man, Two Guvnors on Broadway. But beyond that, he was relatively unknown. So it\u2019s kind of unreal that after just one year in the chair, his show has broken records for people watching on YouTube.",
        "At a news conference Monday, authorities said Oregon State Police\u2019s fatal shooting of one of the occupiers of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, Robert \u201dLaVoy\u201d Finicum, was \u201djustified.\u201d But now the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General is investigating possible misconduct by members of the FBI team involved in the operation.

        "On Friday night, I finally got to see Hamilton, the critically acclaimed musical I\u2019ve been surprisingly obsessed with since Frannie Kelley\u2019s glowing of the cast album last fall. I say \u201dsurprising\u201d because I am not a fan of musical theater, the kind of who pointedly as such should musical theater come up in conversation. But there I was, gripping my seat, as Leslie Odom Jr. the virtuoso who plays Aaron Burr, stood onstage by his lonesome in \u201dWait For It,\u201d my favorite song in a show lousy with fantastic songs.",
        "The once routine practice of getting a glass of water before a restaurant meal in Flint, Mich. is now fraught with apprehension, since lead pipes started leaching into the drinking water after officials switched to the highly corrosive Flint River as the city\u2019s water supply. The crisis over water has touched every aspect of life in Flint, and for restaurants, it could not have come at a worse time. In the past few years, restaurants have been resurging, especially in downtown Flint. Now, they are trying to recoup lost business and convince leery customers that their water is safe."
