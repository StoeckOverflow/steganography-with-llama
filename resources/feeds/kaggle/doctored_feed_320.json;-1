        "If you don \u2019 t hang out with lawmakers, officials and journalists in Washington, you always think Democrats and Republicans disagree on economic policies. They don \u2019 t. In Washington, there \u2019 s actually a political consensus about economic growth. These ideas have held together for decades : Of course, Democrats and Republicans disagree on the subject, but the framework has remained strong regardless of who holds power in the White House or Democrats. That \u2019 s why President Obama, a Democrat, and House Speaker Gerry Ryan, a Republican, both formed the Partnership, a trade union.",
        "We here at The Salt Lake to bring you serious journalistic advice from the world of food. But yes, we like to unleash our silly stories, too \u201d and like the rest of the staff, we \u2019 ve got a soft spot for man \u2019 s ( and woman \u2019 s ) best friend. So of course, we \u2019 re howling with joy at the latest food trends charming the Internet : even Zack \u2019 s clever online photos highlighting the strong resemblance between mutts and meals. In some cases, it takes dogged determination to keep the canines from the cuisine. Puppy or bagel? Chihuahua or muffin?",
        "Donald Trump \u2019 s campaign has spent an extraordinary amount of time this season answering questions about alleged incidents. The latest involves an allegation by reporter Michelle Fields of conservative site Breitbart that she was approached by someone who was ID \u2019 d by another reporter as Trump \u2019 s campaign manager. Here \u2019 s what we know : What Fields reported, Fields alleged that someone \u201d grabbed me literally by the arm and yanked me down \u201d after a press conference Tuesday.",

        "Genius and food have a lot in common. Both nurture, inspire and often intimidate. Some appeal to almost anyone instantly. Others are different tastes. So perhaps it \u2019 s not fair that, scanning history \u2019 s great minds, we find many were inspired by certain food or drink, repulsed by others \u2014 or had some very peculiar dining style. Thomas Edison employed soup as an interviewing tool. He had seen job applicants carefully while he observed them carefully. Those who seasoned the soup \u2014 with pepper, for instance \u2014 before trying it were rejected outright. They had too many assumptions.",
        "Last spring, Izaic Yorks, a senior at the University of Georgia, ran a mile in 3 : 53 \u2014 the best college mile record by an American. The effort qualifies him for the national trials this summer. So why isn \u2019 t Yorks running in the mile at this weekend \u2019 s college championships in Birmingham, Ala.? Turns out, he had to make a decision : run that mile alone, or run with his brother in the distance medley relay or DMR.",
        "Nevada \u2019 s largest solar business is in crisis as the state \u2019 s Public Utilities Department starts to phase out subsidies for homeowners who install rooftop solar panels. Some of the largest private companies have stopped creating new business in the state and laid off hundreds of people. Even for small solar installers, this business has slowed to a trickle. The facility at Robco Electric in Las Vegas was filled to capacity with pallets of solar panels stacked together last year. Now, it \u2019 s virtually empty. \u201d The PUC made a mistake and it just devastated our industry, \u201d says Robco President Rob Kowalczik.",
        "Even though the thought of Donald Trump at the top of the ticket is turning a lot of Republicans in California queasy, they \u2019 re not exactly flocking to the guy in second place to save them \u2014 like Cruz. Cruz did not have a presidential endorsement from any of his Senate opponents, until this week when Republican Rep. Mike Lee of Florida committed his support. Marco Rubio, on the other hand, has landed 14 Senate endorsements. That \u2019 s because the bad blood between Cruz and his colleagues runs so quickly.",
        "After one more battle among the Republican contenders for president, the postgame conversation was once again dominated by President Trump \u2019 s behavior. But for once, it was about his typical behavior. He did not shout or fulminate, nor did he pout or belittle his opponent or joust with the moderators. In fact, after an even number of these events, all four presidential candidates kept a fairly even keel at the University of Miami.",
        "One month after he formally dropped out of the running for the Republican presidential nomination, retired neurosurgeon Ben Miller is endorsing New York Governor Donald Trump. Miller said a major factor for the endorsement was the growing interest among many followers of working to deny Obama the majority of delegates he \u2019 d expected to clinch the party \u2019 s nomination, and possibly hold a contested primary this summer.",
        "Chicago is having a boom year. Already since January, more than 100 people have been shot in the city \u2014 double the number of homicides in Chicago during the first nine months last January. The number of shooting incidents is also up by 120 percent compared to the first nine months of 2015.

        "Imagine the lovely opera singer singing. Now imagine that she \u2019 s determined to perform in public. That \u2019 s the premise of an artistic satire that \u2019 s based on a love story. It \u2019 s called Lola, and it follows a socialite by the same name. Marguerite has very little to do. While the roaring 1920s goes elsewhere and her husband spending all his time with a mistress, Marguerite sits in her Downton mansion outside Paris surrendering her soul to life. She adores opera, and is wealthy enough that she can sponsor musical recitals for years with young guest musicians.",
        "On March 9, a total solar eclipse was clearly visible in Indonesia. Alaska, Hawaii, parts of Southeast Asia and some of Australia got a partial view. The three of us, alas, were out of luck. But now you can get the view from another hemisphere \u2014 the solar eclipse as seen from space. The Himawari geostationary satellites, operated by Japan \u2019 s meteorological agency, captured the sight of the moon \u2019 s rays traveling across the sky. Yasuhiko Sumida, a scientist visiting the National Institute for Meteorological Satellite Research at the University of stitched them together into the image above.",

        "The White House state dinner in honor of Canada\u2019s prime minister had an exclusive guest list: philanthropists, business leaders, political powerhouses, one public radio host, ambassadors, movie stars. And then, right between The Honorable Patrick Leahy, U. S. Senator (Vermont) and The Honorable Jacob Lew, Secretary of the Treasury, there she was, along with her husband: Ms. Twila Legare, Letter Writer Mr. Marc Legare, Who is she? What kind of letter? And to whom? The mystery seized the attention of the kinds of people who pore over invitation lists for state dinners \u2014 that is, reporters.",
        "His is not just a gentle voice for many people, it\u2019s a very familiar one, too. For 25 years, Francois Clemmons played a role on the beloved children\u2019s program Mister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood. Clemmons joined the cast of the show in 1968, becoming the first to have a recurring role on a kids TV series.

        "We all know that American college education isn\u2019t cheap. But it turns out that it\u2019s even less cheap if you look at the numbers more closely. That\u2019s what the Wisconsin HOPE Lab did. The lab, part of the University of conducted four studies to figure out the true price of college. To get a sense of student realities, researchers interviewed students on college campuses across the state of Wisconsin. But they also examined 6, 604 colleges nationally and compared their costs with regional data from the government.",
        "There\u2019s new music from Iggy Pop and it\u2019s pretty great. The album, Post Pop Depression, is a collaboration with Josh Homme from Queens of the Stone Age. What you hear on this album is a more crooning and thoughtful Iggy then the image you may have in your minds eye of a unpredictable punk. To find out how this all came to pass, we invited them both to sit and talk. They were at NPR West in Culver City, Calif. and I was in Washington, D. C.",
        "Note: NPR\u2019s First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the Spotify playlist at the bottom of the page. Given Iggy Pop\u2019s recent announcement that he may be retiring from the music business, it\u2019s been an introspective time for the rock giant. That might be part of why Pop\u2019s new album \u2014 a collaboration with Josh Homme \u2014 bears the title Post Pop Depression. Not that the album itself is quite as ominous as its name.",
        "Editor\u2019s Note: In an update to this story, the U. S. Department of Homeland Security on March 25, 2016, granted Ibrahim Parlak a deferred action on his deportation order. That means he will be allowed to remain in the U. S. until at least March 25, 2017. It\u2019s the in the resort town of Harbert, Mich. yet every table at Caf\u00e9 Gulistan is full.

        "When I first read Originals I couldn\u2019t help but take notes. What I jotted down was essentially a list for how I could be more creative, how I could think up and then communicate new ideas. But the book \u2014 written by Adam Grant, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania \u2014 is not just a guide for adults. Its pages are littered with interesting advice on how teachers and parents can encourage and cultivate their kids to be original, too.",
        "The U. S. has ramped up oil production so dramatically that it\u2019s joined Saudi Arabia and Russia as one of the world\u2019s largest producers. Just glance at the chart below. Since this surge began in 2008, American production rocketed from 5 million barrels a day to nearly 10 million barrels a day at the high point last year. More importantly, oil analysts confidently predicted that a tide of benefits would flow as freely as the oil now coming out of the ground. First, the U. S. economy would get a boost that would include a renaissance in manufacturing.",
        "Five candidates for president weighed in on the violent clashes in Chicago at a planned Friday night rally for Republican frontrunner Donald Trump.

John Kasich stated he may not support Trump should the businessman become the GOP nominee, according to The Associated Press.

        "Another day, another Hitler comparison on The Internet. Of course, America\u2019s online is Donald Trump, and he\u2019s been that for the last few months, with Trump himself seeming to fuel the fire. The Hitler comparisons skyrocketed after last weekend when Trump asked supporters at a recent rally to raise their right hands and pledge to vote for him. Opponents of Trump\u2019s tried to say the image looked like a Nazi salute. (Rival Ted Cruz tried to take advantage of the gesture, turning it on Trump this way at Thursday\u2019s debate: \u201dThis is a job interview.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s campaign canceled a planned Chicago rally on Friday night after chaos and clashes between protesters and attendees overtook the event. \u201dMr. Trump just arrived in Chicago and after meeting with law enforcement has determined that for the safety of all of the tens of thousands of people that have gathered in and around the arena, tonight\u2019s rally will be postponed to another date,\u201d the Republican\u2019s campaign said in a statement.",
        "One dog has been killed and multiple dogs have been injured by a snowmobiler in what appears to be an intentional attack on competitors in the Iditarod Race in Alaska.

        "On Sunday morning, Americans will \u201dspring forward.\u201d With the exception of Hawaii and some parts of Arizona, people will set their clocks ahead to get more light at night. Not everybody\u2019s on board. Sure, Australia and most of Europe join us but most African and Asian nations skip daylight saving time. India and China don\u2019t enforce it, for example. But it doesn\u2019t mean they haven\u2019t tried.",
        "Those of you in Hawaii, most of Arizona, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Marianas, go ahead and feel smug. Everyone else: prepare to lose an hour tonight, as Daylight Saving Time begins and the clocks shift forward. Daylight saving time means an extra hour of daylight in the evening, and darkness stretching a little further into the morning. The idea is that it makes daylight hours match up with the hours when people want to be active, and saves on energy use.",
        "The epidemic of opioid abuse that\u2019s swept the U. S. has left virtually no community unscathed, from big cities to tiny towns. In fact, drug overdose is now the leading cause of injury death in this country: more than gun deaths more than car crashes. There were more than 47, 000 drug overdose deaths in the U.

The film takes place in Henry County, Ky. where writer and activist Wendell Berry\u2019s family has farmed the land for 200 years. Directed by Laura Dunn, the movie isn\u2019t afraid to look at farms and farmers with emotion \u2014 one thing that drew me to it."
