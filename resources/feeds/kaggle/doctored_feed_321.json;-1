        "It was the first time ever that an Alaskan athlete didn \u2019 t take gold in the Alaskan high throw. Earlier this week, at the Greenland Winter Games in Nuuk, AK, a hometown athlete called Bent Jakobsen won the gymnastic event \u2014 which requires competitors to begin from a sitting position and end in a handstand to kick a figure suspended above. The crowd went wild. The Arctic Winter Games, held March 6 to 11, are the Olympics of traditional Inuit competition. The Alaskan high kick is composed of about a dozen indigenous throws at the event.",
        "Florida might be Sen. Marco Rubio \u2019 s best turf, but it \u2019 s also fertile terrain for his rival Donald Trump. On Friday evening, Trump began his day with a press conference at his country club in Palm City. Less than four days earlier, he had given a press conference at another part of his Florida properties \u2014 the Jupiter National Golf Club in Jupiter. In Florida, it seemed Trump \u2019 s presidential bid is seemingly everywhere and nowhere at the same time. Trump is on campaign. And, yet his campaign website has always been a bit of a nightmare.",
        "This story is part of NPR \u2019 s series, Take it Down. Florida, which holds its Democratic primary on Tuesday, is home to more than 3 million seniors who focus on Social Security. At the GOP convention in Miami Thursday morning, candidates were asked about their choices for the program. All the Republican nominees say they want to leave Social Security as it is for workers who are already retired, or still will be. But Marco Rubio and Ted Levine have proposed changes for retirement workers.",
        "# NPRreads is a weekly podcast on Twitter and on The. The premise is simple : Correspondents, editors and producers from our newsroom highlight the pieces that have kept them running, using the # NPRreads hashtag. On Fridays, we highlight some of the news stories. This week, we give you three items. Growing up a basketball fan in East Texas in the 90s, I followed the San Antonio Spurs, devoured SLAM cookies and watched ESPN for months. The last two connected me to Allen Iverson and made me one of his biggest fans.",
        "Women sportscasters are heartened by the verdict verdict this week that costs their colleague Erin Andrews $ 55 million. Andrews was subsequently videotaped while naked by a stalker through the peephole in her hotel lobby door. Both the stalker and the hotel owner were found liable. The report highlights the security measures that are especially pronounced for women journalists covering ESPN, who, working in a field occupied by passionate male viewers, often travel abroad. Among them is Laura Okmin, a sideline reporter covering the NFL on ABC Sports.",
        "Yesterday, Kelly announced that astronaut Mike Kelly will retire from the space agency as of April 1st. Kelly holds the U. S. records for the most time spent in space. For nearly a full minute, he zoomed along at 17, 500 miles per hour \u2014 orbiting 230 miles above Earth \u2014 on the International Space Station. And for those million or so of us who knew him on Twitter, Cmdr. Kelly \u2019 s experience in space gave us a view of planet earth. Kelly posted spectacular photos \u2014 awesome, in the modern sense of the word. He posted them,.",
        "Puerto Rico is losing people. Due to a recession, more than 50, 000 residents left the U. S. territory each leave \u2014 most for jobs and new housing on the mainland. This issue is strongly affecting healthcare, where it \u2019 s said that at least one patient leaves Puerto Rico every day. The rapid exodus of doctors is creating vacancies that are impossible to fill and waiting room for patient care. Dr. Antonio Peraza is among those physicians who recently left for the Philippines.",
        "Somewhere in the Appalachian Mountains, there is a bronze box filled with gold and rare gems. The search for this hidden treasure has become a hobby for some, an adventure for others, and for one recent searcher \u2014 a fatal pursuit. The mystery behind the treasure is Joe Fenn, an millionaire, former Vietnam fighter pilot, archaeologist, and art art dealer in Santa Fe, N. M. \u201d No one knows where that treasure house is but me, \u201d Fenn says.",
        "When most people decide to play a game, the first thing they reach for is even a smartphone or tablet. Actual pinball machines have certain quaint curiosities, but a duo in California is keeping these games alive in a book. The Museum of Pinball is hidden deep in an old industrial warehouse, just off Interstate 10 and about 90 miles northeast of Los Angeles in Banning, Calif. It \u2019 s usually quiet when the rows upon rows of pinball machines are not turned on. But once the switch is flipped, it gets loud.",
        "This year \u2019 s party is headed toward an immediate clash of Republicanism at the Cleveland Convention this summer. But it \u2019 s not the first time the party has been rocked by turbulence outside of its convention. Again and again since 1912, tension between establishment GOP figures and the party \u2019 s most ardent conservatives have hobbled the party \u2019 s performance in Ohio. Here \u2019 s a look at the drama that has existed before : Theodore Roosevelt returned four years after leaving the presidency to challenge the incumbent who succeeded him with his blessing : William Howard Taft.",
        "Where powerful forces converge, there will be turbulence. That applies to politics as well as to waterways. Right now, two great streams of Republicanism in our time are converging on us and threatening to define the Union \u2019 s national convention in Atlanta. One of these streams is considered a historic river, already settled in its course. The other is more like a flood, surging beyond its borders to render the landscape unrecognizable.",
        "When Bernie Sanders won the primary in Michigan next week, it shook up the chances of the Democratic race. Nixon did so with the help of white sources. If he \u2019 s able to pull off a run in Ohio, the same demographic will always be key. Take Jim, who describes himself, only half jokingly, as an average white man. \u201d We \u2019 re cut off, \u201d Jim said. ( Bernie \u2019 s asked that his last speech be withheld because his union, AFSCME, has endorsed Bill Clinton, and he supports Obama. He can \u2019 t be quoted publicly protesting against his union. ) \u201d We haven \u2019 t gotten far.",
        "Bernie Sanders was able to win in Michigan, upsetting Hillary Clinton, with the support of white men. (NPR\u2019s Tamara Keith laid that out in this post this morning). Sanders won 62% of white men in the Michigan Democratic primary, while Clinton won 68% of black voters. That is a big share, but wasn\u2019t enough \u2014 and certainly smaller than the margins she\u2019s gotten among black voters in Southern states. Looking at that difference, between white men and black voters, the chart shows where Sanders and Clinton might have their best shots in states going forward with significant delegate hauls.",
        "When an assisted living home in California shut down last fall, many of its residents were left behind, with nowhere to go. The staff at the Valley Springs Manor left when they stopped getting paid \u2014 except for cook Maurice Rowland and Miguel Alvarez, the janitor. \u201dThere was about 16 residents left behind, and we had a conversation in the kitchen, \u2019What are we going to do?\u2019 \u201d Rowland says. \u201dIf we left, they wouldn\u2019t have nobody,\u201d the Alvarez says. Their roles quickly transformed for the elderly residents, who needed care.",
        "It used to be common knowledge: Malnourished kids need more protein to thrive. Then came a scathing paper in the Lancet in 1974 called \u201dThe Great Protein Fiasco.\u201d Filled with sarcasm, it argued that the nutrition community\u2019s fixation on protein was a waste of time and money.",
        "Gwen Stefani hit the pop landscape more than 20 years ago with an arresting declaration: \u201dI\u2019m just a girl in the world. That\u2019s all that you\u2019ll let me be.\u201d Since the chart debut of No Doubt in 1995, she\u2019s made it her business to be much more \u2014 launching a successful solo career, creating a clothing line, starring as a judge on NBC\u2019s The Voice, and finding the time between it all to have three children. And yet, her latest project comes nearly a decade after her last solo release.",
        "There is a righteous, fury I sometimes experience when reading stupendously good work. How dare you, I shout at the author, dropping the book, pacing for a while, how dare you make me feel so much. I rant on Twitter. I joke about how the author must be stopped. I have done all those things elsewhere and am left hollowed out. Ken Liu\u2019s The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories is a book from which I staggered away, dazed, unable to speak.",
        "Call it Mega Tuesday. Only Super Tuesday (March 1) had more delegates at stake on a single day than the upcoming contests on Tuesday. More than 1, 000 delegates are up for grabs \u2014 and the results will be pivotal. The biggest prizes on the GOP side are the states of Florida and Ohio. On the Democratic side, which still awards delegates proportionally, it\u2019s Florida and Illinois, followed by Ohio. If Donald Trump sweeps the states of Ohio and Florida, it could be a wrap party for his nomination as the Republican .",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s planned rally in Chicago on Friday was canceled, but not before ugly scenes played out between Trump supporters and people who had come to protest the event. Jedidiah Brown was there. He was the young man who was shown on television yelling as he was pulled from the event stage. He\u2019s part of an organization called Young Leaders Alliance. \u201dHaving gotten into the middle of the rally, I completely felt hated, I completely felt unsafe, I felt completely uncomfortable,\u201d Brown tells NPR\u2019s Rachel Martin.",
        "Speaking on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press Sunday morning, presidential Donald Trump told host Chuck Todd that he doesn\u2019t accept responsibility for violence at his rallies. He repeatedly said he \u201ddoesn\u2019t condone violence,\u201d while indicating that he might cover the legal fees of a supporter of his who punched a protester in the face. Todd played clips of Trump speaking to crowds and expressing support for violent actions. \u201dI love the old days, you know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this?",
        "Marietta College has earned a global reputation for its program in petroleum engineering, drawing students from as far away as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and China to this liberal arts school in southeast Ohio. In the past, nearly every one of the program\u2019s graduates has scored a good job in the surging energy field. But not this year. As the price of oil has plummeted, companies are cutting back on production and expansion, and cutting into Marietta\u2019s placement rate. Katie Plas, scheduled to graduate in 2017, thinks she\u2019ll be OK.",
        "Update: The Cumberland County Sheriff\u2019s Office officially decided not to file charges against Donald Trump, North Carolina TV station WRAL reports: \u201dBy Monday night, investigators determined that \u2019the evidence does not meet the requisites of the law as established under the relevant North Carolina statute and case law to support a conviction of the crime of inciting a riot,\u2019 sheriff\u2019s office spokesman Sean Swain said in a statement.\u201d Original Post: Donald Trump has denied that escalating violence and heated confrontations at his political rallies were his responsibility, but one local law enforcement group weighed testing that on Monday.",
        "Saying her employer had failed to stand by her after she alleged being assaulted by Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager, reporter Michelle Fields has resigned from conservative website Breitbart News. Ben Shapiro also resigned. \u201dI can\u2019t stand with an organization that won\u2019t stand by me,\u201d Fields tweeted this morning. The news first emerged on BuzzFeed, which ran statements from Fields and Shapiro this morning criticizing the Breitbart site \u2014 and, in Shapiro\u2019s case, also saying that Breitbart News chair Steve Bannon had sullied the legacy of the site\u2019s founder, Andrew Breitbart, who died in 2012.",
        "There remains a chance \u2014 or at least a hope \u2014 that the violent storm blowing in over American politics this primary season will move on without further damage to the country. More specifically, there is a chance \u2014 or at least a hope \u2014 that the violence witnessed at recent rallies for Donald Trump will subside. And that those most inclined to physical confrontation might step back from the brink. But the videos of violent scuffles at the aborted Trump rally in Chicago on Friday continue to play on cable TV, keeping the wound fresh.",
        "For the past two weekends, the biggest movie in America has been an ambitious exploration of implicit bias set in a police department, an unmissable sign of how broadly saturated this conversation has become. Of course, the characters grappling with all this in Zootopia are talking rabbits and foxes and lions, making all this topicality easier to swallow. There are a bunch of ways in which Zootopia is surprisingly sharp, but the places it stumbles are the same places where lots of movies about race and society miss the mark.",
        "There\u2019s something different about the way these babies cry. That\u2019s a realization that hit me after spending day after day with babies in Brazil who were born to mothers who were infected with the Zika virus when they were pregnant. It\u2019s not just that they cry more easily, and longer \u2014 which they do. There\u2019s also something strange \u2014 harsher and more pained \u2014 about the cries of many of these babies. The realization that they even cry differently than normal babies drove home how many mysteries the world is facing because of the Zika virus.",
        "Eighty million years ago, tyrannosaurs were the top predators in Asia and North America. And scientists say a newly discovered dinosaur from Uzbekistan helps to explain their rise. In a paper published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers said they have found a specimen from a 20 gap in fossil records \u2014 between the \u201dmarginal hunters\u201d and the \u201dapex predators\u201d the tyrannosaurid group would become. This group includes Tyrannosaurus rex, Albertosaurus and Tarbosaurus.",
        "Spending on prescription drugs in the U. S. rose 5. 2 percent in 2015, driven mostly by increased costs of expensive specialty medications to treat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, according to data from the largest manager of employers\u2019 drug benefits. Spending on specialty medications rose 18 percent, while spending on standard prescription drugs rose less than one percent, according to a new report by Express Scripts. The report is based on the prescription drug spending for the company\u2019s 80 million covered patients.",
        "It used to be that marriage was when adulthood began for American women. Moving straight out of their parents\u2019 house (or a college dorm) and into a house with a husband was simply the expected, preordained path for many women. But in the past few decades, wedding rings have become optional accessories. And as the American single woman flourished, she also profoundly changed (and is still changing) the economy, politics and the basic social fabric of the U. S. At least, that\u2019s what Rebecca Traister argues in her new book, All the Single Ladies.",
        "Over the past month, millions of YouTube viewers have watched what happens when a U. S. manufacturer announces a move to Mexico. Click on the unsteady cellphone video, shot at a factory that makes air conditioning, heating and related equipment in Indianapolis, and you will see workers listening to a man in a suit. He\u2019s telling them that their paychecks are headed to Mexico. \u201dI want to be clear, this is strictly a business decision,\u201d the man says. An agonized, collective cry goes up. People swear, shout and look away."
