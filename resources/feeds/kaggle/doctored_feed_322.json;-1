        "You can \u2019 t find a more complex relationship between humans, fish and nature than fishing, wrote Michele Mesmain, international CEO of Slow Fish, a seafood spinoff of the Slow Food movement. First of all the thousands of boats at home, catching wild salmon to haul back to shore and eat. \u201d It \u2019 s our last year of widely eaten, popular wild food, \u201d she said. Held every January in Genoa, Slow Fish attracts about 50, 000 chefs, fishers, scholars, experts and eaters to promote fishing, maintaining biodiversity, cooking and preserving neglected seafood species.

        "Russian President Vladimir Putin declares Monday he has ordered the withdrawal of the majority of Russian soldiers from Syria. The pullout, which he said was popular with Syrian President Bashar Assad, is set to begin Tuesday. Later in a meeting with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Defense minister Sergei Shoigu, Putin confirmed the objective of Russia \u2019 s operations \u2014 disrupting ISIS and other terror groups \u2014 had \u201d been established, \u201d and had laid the groundwork for more intense military talks.",
        "Editor \u2019 s Notes : Last fall, Today \u2019 s Maanvi Singh embarked on a search to find her ideal pumpkin pie recipe. As she discovered, there \u2019 s a touch of science involved in removing the crust and filling just the way you like it. To celebrate Christmas Day, we reprise this story, last published last September. It was the best of pies, it was the worst of pies. I have tasted many, many, many pies. And when I first began creating pumpkin pies this autumn, my results were at first inconsistent and, at worst, uncertain.",
        "Today is Business Day, a time to find the number that helps us calculate the ratio of a ball \u2019 s circumference to its diameter. Here in the U. S. Earth Day has officially become a \u201d thing \u201d \u2014 for example, today at Whole Foods, you can eat slices of pie for $ 3. 14, and if you can solve solving problems from a Princeton University, Pizza Hut will give you 3. 14 dollars \u2019 worth of free meals. The developing world, which we discuss in this blog, loves its pi, too.",
        "Britons will vote in parliament on whether to stay or join the European Union. Both sides are campaigning fiercely in what is seen as the Brexit, or British exit, debate. The town of Hastings on Sussex \u2019 s south coast is one of the closest points to the main continent. But local popularity polls show about whether the people here want us to leave the European Union. Paul Joy makes his way to his fishing lodge at the end of a pebble beach. He and his partner, Douglas, come from a tribe that has fished these waters for generations.",
        "When you really needed help, Siri might not really be there for you. And if you told the Google App or S Voice from Samsung that you were just sexually abused or beaten by your partner, they don \u2019 t have nothing to offer, a study means. A researcher who worked with Holocaust survivors and people with history of suicide began wondering if people could actually help by telling their smartphone they were suicide. So Dr. Adam Miner, a cognitive psychologist and postdoc at Stanford University, brought the idea up to one of his advisers, Dr.",
        "While I sat on the piano watching Graham Nash play The Hollies \u2019 1966 hit \u201d Non Stop, \u201d I caught a glimpse of the same transistor radio I had as a kid when that sound filled the AM radio airwaves. It was unique and beautiful. Nash has a voice that resonates and cuts to the core. When he released the title track from his fourth solo album This Morning Tonight, I was moved by the volume and quality of his tone. His lucid sound displays the deep introspection that increases with age he \u2019 s 74 and as insightful as ever.",
        "Glint in the grass? Man, it \u2019 s not even a nickel. But last week, Israeli David Rimon spotted a gleam while on a hike in northern Israel with several travelers. It turned out to be a gold coin so unusual, Israeli researchers say there is only one other one with the same symbols in the world. \u201d It \u2019 s incredibly exciting, \u201d said Prof. Donald Ariel, an expert with the Israel Antiquities Authority, in news released by the agency, which confirmed the coin was struck by Roman Emperor Trajan in the year 107.",
        "If you \u2019 ve ever tried buying a red sports car or quit your job to follow your muse, if you \u2019 ve ever talked to Lester Burnham in American Idol, there \u2019 s some good news. Midlife change is not inevitable, and reaching 45 is not the final step in a slow, agonizing decline. After interviewing more than 400 people, I found that midlife, while normal, is, for many if not most people, the highlight of their lives. Here are five reasons we misunderstand midlife. 1. It \u2019 s time for my midlife crisis. In Australia, midlife crisis is rare.",

A painless way to use cavities in adults is gaining weight. \u201d OK, Alice, we are going to put the fluoride varnish on your teeth, \u201d said Marion Manski, director of the dental hygiene program at the University of Washington School of Dentistry. Fluoride varnish is standard procedure for children \u2019 s teeth, but Manski \u2019 s sister, Alice Clash, is 91 years old.",
        "The GOP presidential race dropped by one percent on Tuesday night, but Republicans are still no closer to uniting without a nominee. Democrats, though, did get more clarity as Hillary Clinton racked up more wins over Bernie Sanders, extending her campaign lead and complicating the Vermont governor \u2019 s nomination calculation. In the November race, Donald Trump dealt a fatal blow to the campaign of Marco Rubio, the senator from Florida, who suspended his term shortly after losing his home state to Trump.",
        "Florida Sen. Marco Rubio announced Tuesday night that he was suspending his campaign for president after losing his home state in a landslide to Donald Trump. \u201dAfter tonight it is clear that while we are on the right side, we will not be on the winning side,\u201d Rubio told supporters in Miami. Rubio congratulated Donald Trump at the start of his speech, but later appeared to criticize the real estate mogul\u2019s tactics.",
        "Apple says the government \u201dattempts to rewrite history\u201d with its request for help unlocking an iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters by stretching the law far wider than the Constitution and the lawmakers have intended. \u201dThe Founders would be appalled,\u201d Apple wrote in its last court filing before it squares off against the government in federal court in California at a hearing on March 22. \u201dThe government . ..",
        "Faced with her own forgetfulness, former NPR correspondent and author Barbara Bradley Hagerty tried to do something about it. She\u2019s written about her efforts in her book on midlife, called Life Reimagined. To her surprise, she discovered that an older dog can learn new tricks. A confession: I loathe standardized tests, and one of the perks of reaching midlife is that I thought I\u2019d never have to take another. But lately I\u2019ve noticed that in my 50s, my memory isn\u2019t the same as it once was.",
        "Starting at midnight Tuesday, the D. C. Metro rail system will shut down for 29 hours while authorities investigate potential dangers related to a cable fire on Monday, Metro\u2019s General Manager Paul Wiedefeld said at a news conference Tuesday.

These ubiquitous, chain restaurants have been serving up not just waffles but all manner of Southern comfort foods \u2019round the clock for more than 60 years. And for the past 30 years or so, Waffle House has also been working on a side project: making music.

        "The Obama administration is reversing a plan to allow oil drilling in the Atlantic Ocean, after an uproar from local communities over environmental concerns. \u201dWe heard from many corners that now is not the time to offer oil and gas leasing off the Atlantic coast,\u201d Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said.

        "As a Youngstown native, I have come to expect this. Every presidential election year, candidates flock to Youngstown, Ohio, to use my hometown as a political backdrop. It\u2019s a great place to talk about job losses. Steel mills used to line the Mahoning River for miles, churning out tens of thousands of jobs. Those jobs drove the city\u2019s population from 33, 000 in 1890 to 170, 000 in 1930. My grandparents came from Poland and Hungary to join in that boom. In the century, Youngstown became known for its union jobs and high levels of home ownership.",

She remembers helping her mom keep track of the number of days she\u2019d stayed away from cigarettes by putting stickers in a journal. The experience made her want to help others stop smoking.",
        "Editor\u2019s note: Since we first published this post, the young woman who told her story has asked that her full name not be reported. It is NPR policy not to report the full names of rape survivors without their consent. We have edited this post to refer to her as Grace, her middle name. Grace has also clarified some key details. She says she misspoke when she said the rape occurred when she was 16. She says she was 13 years old then, and was 16 when she became pregnant after engaging in consensual sex.",
        "Ahead of President Obama\u2019s landmark trip to Cuba later this month, the U. S. is loosening sanctions regulations against Cuba. The changes make it easier for U. S. citizens to travel to the island and allow nonimmigrant Cubans who are in the U. S legally to earn salaries. \u201dNormalization means not just normalization between governments, it means normalization of our relationship with the Cuban people. And that is what this change really aims to advance,\u201d Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters as he announced the changes.",
        "Humans like to place things in categories and can struggle when things can\u2019t easily be categorized. That also applies to people, a study finds, and the brain\u2019s visual biases may play a role in perceptions of people. The study, published in Psychological Science on Monday, asked people to sort images of people as either white or black, but it included multiracial faces in the mix, too. There has been much less research into attitudes about people, even though they are the racial group in the United States.",
        "A mated pair of bald eagles that have nested in the U. S. National Arboretum since 2014 are now starting a family, taking turns incubating two eggs \u2014 and one of them could hatch sometime Tuesday.

        "A discussion on Capitol Hill about concussion research brought a startling moment Monday, as an NFL executive acknowledged for the first time that football has been linked to a degenerative brain disease. Jeff Miller, the NFL\u2019s executive vice president for health and safety, admitted the connection when he was asked about research by Boston University neuropathologist Dr. Ann McKee, who has reported finding signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy in the brains of 90 out of 94 former pro football players \u2014 and 45 out of 55 former college players.",
        "Russian President Vladimir Putin just made another shrewd and decisive move with his surprising decision to start withdrawing forces from Syria. Or, the Russian leader was overextended abroad and short of cash at home and was looking for a quick exit.",
        "By now, you probably know that Americans waste a lot of food. Each year, an estimated 133 billion pounds of food that farmers grow never makes it to our plates. That\u2019s enough to fill 44 skyscrapers. And tons of it ends up in landfills, where it emits methane, a greenhouse gas. The Obama administration has set a goal of reducing food waste by 50 percent by 2030.",
        "Encouraging doctors and nurses to wash their hands frequently has always been considered an effective way to curb the spread of infection in hospitals and other health facilities. But a research letter published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine points to another key group of people who aren\u2019t always keeping their hands so clean and probably should: patients. Researchers focused on Detroit and looked at patients who went from hospitals to care facilities \u2014 places like rehabilitation centers, facilities, hospice and care hospitals.",
        "For more than a generation, politicians have been on notice that political opponents would hold them accountable through deep dives into their records \u2014 a practice called oppo research. This election cycle, candidates for the White House also have found themselves trying to dodge a buzz saw: BuzzFeed. Andrew Kaczynski, 26, runs a political research unit for the news organization, scouring the historical record to unearth buried stances taken by leading candidates. A surprising number of the controversies and scoops that surface in televised debates and interviews started with Kaczynski\u2019s team, called the .",
        "Last summer, Jacky Alcin\u00e9 learned just how biased computers can be. Alcin\u00e9, who is took a bunch of pictures with friends at a concert. Later he loaded them into Google Photos, which stores and automatically organizes images. Google\u2019s software is able to group together pictures of a particular friend, or pictures of dogs, cats, etc. But when it labeled a picture of one of Alcin\u00e9\u2019s friends, who is also it left him speechless. \u201dIt labeled it as something else. It labeled her as a different species or creature,\u201d says a horrified Alcin\u00e9."
