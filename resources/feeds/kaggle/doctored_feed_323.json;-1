        "Like it or not, much of what we encounter online is produced by algorithms \u2014 complex formulas that would determine our Facebook pages, Netflix recommendations, Spotify playlists or mobile ads. But algorithms, like humans, can make predictions. Last month, Google found the site Flickr \u2019 s viral technology was labeling people as \u201d apes \u201d and survivors of Nazi concentration camps as \u201d jungle gym \u201d and \u201d agents. \u201d How does this happen?",
        "The fallout from Edward Snowden \u2019 s 2013 secret revelations is not over yet, according to Michael Ledgett, who ran the National Intelligence Agency \u2019 s investigation into Snowden \u2019 s leaks. It \u2019 s been nearly three years since Snowden, a former contractor for the CIA, told the world about the extraordinary collection of American criminal records. But in an interview at agency headquarters, Ledgett, the agency \u2019 s managing director, tells us that more classified documents about the real workings of the government surveillance network may yet come to light. \u201d There are still some other hints to drop, I think, \u201d said Ledgett.",
        "On Sunday, Lisa Macve played her first gig in the United States. Four nights later, behind the bustling Austin event space Palm Door on Friday, the songwriter from County Cork in Ireland sang us a lullaby. Her song \u201d Sycamore Tree \u201d ponders the day while longing for the past : \u201d every day when I \u2019 m old with my family behind me I want to sit down in the shade of the same old sycamore Tree, \u201d she sings.",
        "Psychologists disagree on whether expecting your marriage to be a financially fulfilling relationship make it more likely that the union will thrive, or that it will expose you to disappointment. So, psychologists, should we just go back and expect the worst after the worst?",
        "Prompted by a letter signed by more than 20 academy members of Chinese descent, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences apologized for offensive remarks about Asians during the awards ceremony. \u201d Thank you for taking the time to address your concerns about our 88th Oscar win, which are valid. We appreciate your support and take your points very seriously. It certainly was never the academy \u2019 s intent to offend anyone, \u201d the letter read, in part. For some, the irony was hollow.",
        "President Bush \u2019 s choice to serve as the US Supreme Court Justice is Merrick Garland, a moderate former appeals court judge and former prosecutor with a reputation for collegiality and meticulous legal reasoning. Garland, who has won past Republican championships, has \u201d more federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court justice in history, \u201d a White House official said. \u201d No judge is better suited to currently serve on the Supreme Court. \u201d Garland is the latest lawyer from the federal appeals courts in Washington to be promoted to the US Supreme Court.",
        "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell met again Wednesday to block Barack Obama \u2019 s Supreme Court nomination, saying the American people should have a \u201d voice \u201d in the election. \u201d It is a president \u2019 s constitutional right to nominate a Supreme Court justice, and it is the Senate \u2019 s constitutional right to act as a check on a president and withhold its consent, \u201d McConnell stated on the Senate floor opposing the president \u2019 s nomination of U. S. Court of Appeals judge Merrick Garland. In his remarks earlier in the day, President Obama had called for the Senate to push politics aside and remove Garland.",
        "President Kennedy \u2019 s nominee for the Supreme Court is already making telephone calls to senators, eager to win a confirmation hearing. Merrick Garland will start making visits to the Capitol on Sundays. That \u2019 s the normal order of business for a nominee. But with many liberal Republicans insisting they won \u2019 t recognize Garland \u2019 s nomination, the White House is also making its case to the American media. The PR campaign for Garland includes a dedicated campaign handle ( @ scotusnom ) a biographical essay and a litany of details designed to humanize the appellate community.",
        "This week the audience \u2019 s been treated to a commentary on land reform from a surprising author : William Shakespeare. 2016 being the 400th anniversary of the Bard \u2019 s death, many fans are doing celebrations of one type or another. The British Museum, in hosting a major celebration, has put online the only surviving scrap of a script in Shakespeare \u2019 s handwriting \u2014 a scene that holds eerily poignant echoes in today \u2019 s newspapers about refugees and immigration on both sides of the Atlantic. It \u2019 s a speech from a play, The Book of Sir Kenneth More, that was not by Shakespeare.",
        "Federal Reserve policymakers said Wednesday that the U. S. economy is chugging along at a good pace with an improving money market. Still, they recognize risks from \u201d global warming and financial developments. \u201d So knowing that balance of good markets and growing risks, the National Open Market Commission decided to take no stance on the target range for the sovereign funds rate at the conclusion of its meeting. At a press conference, Fed Chair Michael Yellen said that for now, holding investment rates steady was the \u201d prudent \u201d step.",
        "The Federal Trade Commission is proposing, for the first time, privacy legislation for Internet service providers. The goal is to let citizens weigh in on what information about them gets collected and how it \u2019 s used. As they bring us to the Internet, ISPs have come into our lives \u2014 websites we run, apps we download or products we visit \u2014 and may take that data for their own promotions or send it to data brokers to be used for marketing or other purposes.",

        "It \u2019 s been called \u201d perhaps the most contentious issue in the food business \u201d : Should food products be changed to indicate they contain genetically modified ingredients? Republican Republicans in the Senate tried to answer that question on purpose with a clear \u201d no, \u201d but failed. The Senate rejected a bill that could have prevented any state from imposing GMO labels on food. The measure, sponsored by Kansas House Sen.",
        "The shutdown of Washington, D. C. \u2019 s Metrorail system for an entire period \u2014 29 hours to be exact \u2014 for a subsequent inspection prompted a New York Times interviewee to say : \u201d It \u2019 s the capital of the United States and one of the biggest urban centers in the country. This is like a developing country. \u201d however, it \u2019 s not like a developing country, according to Aniruddha Dasgupta, global director of the World Resources Institute \u2019 s Ross Center for Sustainable Cities, who is based in D. C. It \u2019 s in a category all by itself. \u201d This is very unusual, \u201d said Dasgupta.",
        "The Washington, D. C. Metrorail system will be out of service for 29 hours due to potential faults in the electrical system. The subway is key for commuters, many of whom staff the federal government.",
        "The new movie Krisha is a family drama about addiction and chaos. In it, a recovering addict named Krisha comes home for Thanksgiving after being away from her family for years. If the family in the film seems tighter than most acting ensembles, it\u2019s because they have history: The director and writer, Trey Edward Shults, cast his aunt as the main character, his mother as the family matriarch and himself in the role of Krisha\u2019s estranged son.",
        "When it comes to turnout, the tables have. ..uh, turned. In 2008, Democrats had the historic turnout numbers. GOP voters, meanwhile, came out in modest numbers in 2008 and 2012. But this year, Democrats are seeing their turnout figures fall off since 2008. Republicans, meanwhile, are coming out in droves. Republicans continued to watch their turnout skyrocket in last night\u2019s five huge primary states. Turnout grew by 16 percent in North Carolina over 2012\u2019s total \u2014 and that was the most modest bump.",
        "Tuesday\u2019s big primary night helped both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump extend their delegate leads in their respective parties. And as each state votes, we\u2019re beginning to get a clearer glimpse at just who their supporters are. For Trump, his support continues to cross traditional demographic and socioeconomic lines, underscoring just how difficult it will continue to be for Republicans opposing his controversial candidacy to stop him. But some of his weaknesses with GOP voters could also be a problem for him in a general election.",
        "In the presidential nominating contests of recent decades, the middle of March has told the tale. By St. Patrick\u2019s Day, we expect to know one, if not both, of the major party nominees. Usually, the rest of the election season is just a operation. Of course, it\u2019s been hard to find such clarity in 2016, the year that defies nearly every expectation at every turn.",
        "An artificially intelligent computer system built by Google has just beaten the world\u2019s best human, Lee Sedol of South Korea, at an ancient strategy game called Go. Go originated in Asia about 2, 500 years ago and is considered many, many times more complex than chess, which fell to AI back in 1997. And here\u2019s what\u2019s really crazy. Google\u2019s programmers didn\u2019t explicitly teach AlphaGo to play the game. Instead, they built a sort of model brain called a neural network that learned how to play Go by itself.",
        "It\u2019s in the news everywhere, with hubris: Google\u2019s DeepMind machine beat the world champion of the game Go with a score of . Or, according to Britain\u2019s Independent newspaper: \u201dGoogle\u2019s computer has definitely beaten the best human in the world, finishing a pioneering match at .\u201d The \u201dbest human in the world,\u201d South Korean professional Go player Lee Sedol, is actually ranked No. 5 in the world. Clearly a stellar Go player \u2014 but not the world\u2019s best. Mind you, there are several kinds of rankings for Go and they don\u2019t always agree.",
        "Editor\u2019s Note: Hozaifa Almaleh made his name as a basketball player in Syria. The sport also provided an avenue out of the country as it suffers through a devastating civil war. As the country marks five years since the start of the uprising, the Almaleh reflects on the game \u2014 and the war \u2014 that has led him to Chicago. I played professional basketball for the Syrian national team from 2004 to 2013, traveling around the world for a decade representing my country.",
        "Google Street View allows people to virtually walk through places from the Aeon Mall in Okinawa, Japan, to historic sites like Petra in Jordan without leaving their homes. But type in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and you won\u2019t see anything. That\u2019s because the city is basically off the Google grid, as are many locations in developing countries. A joint effort between the World Bank\u2019s Dar Ramani Huria and Swedish startup Mapillary aims to change that. \u201dDar es Salaam has really poor map data,\u201d says Jan Erik Solem, CEO of Mapillary.",
        "Federal appeals court judge Merrick Garland headed to Capitol Hill Thursday afternoon to meet with senators, beginning the traditional ritual of any nominee to the Supreme Court. But for the former prosecutor, the exercise could be in vain. Senate Republicans are holding steadfast in their refusal to even consider Garland\u2019s nomination to succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who died unexpectedly last month. GOP leadership\u2019s insistence they won\u2019t hold confirmation hearings or a vote during an election year is something Democrats are framing as a failure for Republicans to do their job.",
        "Artist Robert Mapplethorpe was as controversial as he was celebrated. In 1989, his photographs depicting nude men and sexual fetishes helped ignite the culture wars. Now, an upcoming HBO documentary, Mapplethorpe: Look at the Pictures, examines the artist\u2019s life and work. He\u2019s also the subject of a major retrospective spanning two L. A. museums \u2014 the J. Paul Getty Museum and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. With his Hasselblad and Polaroid cameras, Mapplethorpe worked out of his East Village studio. He photographed lovers, friends, models and himself.",
        "Hillary Clinton was declared the winner of the Missouri Democratic primary by The Associated Press on Thursday evening, nearly two days after the state held its primary. She eked out a slim victory of just 1, 531 votes over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. That\u2019s a difference of just of a percent and was within the margin of a possible recount, but Sanders said earlier Thursday he wouldn\u2019t ask for that.",
        "After two years of research and more than 400 interviews about midlife, former NPR reporter Barb Bradley Hagerty received dozens of insights about how to live well in the middle years. We\u2019ve distilled them here, with a little context. And, by the way, these ideas work well for people on both sides of the midlife divide. 1. Aim for meaning rather than happiness, and you will likely find both.",
        "There\u2019s a funny thing about the future tense: It\u2019s all but impossible to deny. Take any verb, append the little word \u201dwill\u201d to the front of it, and suddenly, you\u2019ve got a proposition that\u2019s awfully tough to knock down. I will write, I will act, I will be \u2014 until the proposed moment comes along, until we find out, one way or the other, whether I have in fact done as promised, the possibility I will replenishes every time I speak it. It\u2019s as if, through sheer force of \u201dwill,\u201d we can achieve anything of our choosing.",
        "Syrian kids who passed through Milan\u2019s Central Station last year did something very Italian: create artwork. While they waited for trains to take them to northern Europe, Save the Children offered them a chance to draw. They could depict whatever they wanted, says psychologist Vittoria Ardino, president of the Italian Society for the Study of Traumatic Stress, who analyzed 500 of these images. There\u2019s a lot that can be learned from children\u2019s art. \u201dIt\u2019s one of the most effective tools to help them be understood by adults,\u201d Ardino says.",
        "If you\u2019re planning to hoist a pint of Irish dry stout for St. Patrick\u2019s Day, the folks at Guinness have a polite request: Don\u2019t slurp the foamy head off their beer. It\u2019s essentially a nitrogen cap, they say, that\u2019s protecting the flavors underneath from being oxidized. St. Patrick\u2019s is a huge day for the legendary brewer \u2014 of the 70 million people who are estimated to be celebrating today, around 13 million will also drink a glass of Guinness."
