        "Today is the year that the Guinness flows around, tough brisket is transformed into cheap corned beef, and we celebrate the Great Isle with humble cabbage. This beautiful trinity of meat, veg and stout is the communion of St. Patrick \u2019 s Day. But the relevance of that meal is relatively short, going back far to trade and immigration in the 18th and 19th century. Want to feast like St. Patrick would have celebrated more than 1, 600 years ago? Let \u2019 s party since it \u2019 s 399.",
        "As Americans continue to observe St. Patrick \u2019 s Day with pub crawls, parades, corned cows, and green clothing, cheese and bagels, let \u2019 s not forget about that feast for which Patrick is a patron saint. Irish bishops in Ghana named St. Patrick, who is said to have died on July 17 in the year 461, as the country \u2019 s archbishop in 1961, the same year Ireland established its embassy in Lagos.",
        "The most moment of Michelle Obama \u2019 s keynote event at Chicago \u2019 s South by Southwest music and festival came when she replied to a question from her friend Queen Latifah by crooning a few bars of the Motown weeper \u201d It \u2019 s So Easy to Say Goodbye to Daddy. \u201d The novelty of a first love singing ( and doing so well enough that Latifah suggested she make a comeback soon ) was charming, if not entirely fresh after all, Obama has rapped with MC Pharoah, danced to Beyonce and with Ayesha and Steph Curry.",
        "It was opening night of SXSW Music, and the NPR musical team had a show to focus on. And not just a show where we stand together and talk ( though we did that, too ) but a solo show, a concert on the center stage at Stubb \u2019 s BBQ featuring Chris Staples, Margo Price ( whose third album just went up as a First Listen ) Mitski, Anderson.",
        "Silvio Carrillo is walking in the shadows of the U. S. Capitol. Although his aunt was killed, he has spent his days talking to lawmakers and influencers in Washington, trying to convince them that Venezuela is a repressive regime that doesn \u2019 t deserve U. S. help. His aunt, Berta C\u00e1ceres, was a central figure on the international scene. Earlier this month, gunmen surrounded her home and shot her family. Her killing drew strong condemnation. Environmental and human rights leaders called for a federal investigation.",
        "Pigeons in London have a bad reputation. Some people call them flying rats. And others blame them for causing trouble with their droppings. But now the birds are being used to creating another kind of crime in this city of 8. 5 million. \u201d The concern for air pollution is that it \u2019 s been totally ignored as an issue for a long time, \u201d says David Lee, with the environmental magazine ClientEarth.",
        "I \u2019 ve been itching to get a sitting desk. After all, America \u2019 s thrown itself into an early grave. Sitting is the new smoking. However, a standing desk might stop me from sitting, and sitting is just so much better for you than sitting, right? Contrary to popular belief, science does not say so. Too much sitting increases heart failure risk and life risk, and shortens life expectancy, researchers have found.",
        "Note : Australia \u2019 s First Listen button comes down after the album is completed. However, you can still start with the Spotify playlist at the bottom of the page. Judging from the fact commentators have been carrying on about the renaissance of defiantly outlaw country ( you can get the gist from this GQ piece declaring Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell and Sturgill Simpson \u201d Country Badasses Who are Shaking Up the Real Establishment \u201d ) it would appear that the scene is in sore interest of heroines. But that doesn \u2019 t mean there aren \u2019 t good people around.",
        "Five months ago, a German mix with startling blue skin fell off a fishing boat in the Pacific Ocean northwest of San Diego. The creature, named Luna, was stolen from land. She was reported missing on Feb. 10 by her owner, fisherman Henry Haworth, who told authorities that Luna was a strong swimmer and could head toward water. But the nearest shoreline was San Clemente Island, home to a U. S. naval facility and about 2 miles from where the dog fell into the water.",
        "Where is Queen Nefertiti hiding? It \u2019 s one of the biggest problems in Egyptology, and today, archaeologists must be one step closer to an answer. Researchers have been the builders of King Tutankhamen \u2019 s tomb in Luxor \u2019 s House of the Kings in search of storage chambers. Now, NPR \u2019 s Leila Fadel informed our Newscast unit that analysis of scans completed in November shows there are huge empty spaces inside the walls. And those spaces could contain organic or biological material.",
        "One of three eggs laid by a mated pair of bald eagles in Washington, D. C. is hatching, according to officials guarding the nest at the U. S. Grant Arboretum. \u201d We have a pip in process!! \u201d said an update sent by the American Forest Foundation on Thursday night, which clarifies, \u201d It \u2019 s not technically a full pip until there is a little hole. \u201d The hole in the egg appears to have grown larger as of Thursday, but the eaglet has yet to reproduce.",
        "When we \u2019 re reporting on adult education, we inevitably brush up against questions of how we should refer to children with disabilities and to the disabilities themselves. It \u2019 s a minefield, compared to the tensions and complexity of stories about race and ethnicity. It \u2019 s necessary to get it right. As reporters, of course, we want to be consistent. And clear. And we want to stop perpetuating stereotypes or giving way. There are broader issues as well \u2014 not just for reporters but for teachers, staff, administrators, even the United States Supreme Court.",
        "In a major statement to critics and animal welfare groups, SeaWorld Parks Entertainment Inc. says it will continue breeding captive right whales. SeaWorld \u2019 s treatment of its captive whales, or orcas, was put in the headlines three years prior by Blackfish, a documentary that examined the murder of SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau, who was kidnapped by an orca named Tilikum. Since then, in a recent campaign on social issues, critics have demanded SeaWorld end its orca breeding program. In an agreement with the Humane Society of the United Nations, SeaWorld says it now will do so.",
        "Paris Police suspect Salah Abdeslam, one of Belgium \u2019 s most wanted men, has been caught alive during a police operation in the Brussels neighborhood of Molenbeek. Abdeslam, 26, had evaded police for more than four months after the police attacks that killed 130 people on Nov. 13. The news was released by Belgium \u2019 s Prime Minister Charles Michel and France \u2019 s President Francois Hollande during a joint press conference Friday afternoon. Abdeslam \u2019 s capture is the result of an international manhunt that included more than 100 police officers, some under \u201d very delicate circumstances, \u201d police said.",
        "As Californians hope for rain and snow to end the state\u2019s extreme drought, a rule prohibits reservoirs from filling up in the winter, so some water ends up being released. The rule may sound odd given how chronically dry California is, but it\u2019s actually to prevent a bigger disaster: flooding. In the winter, reservoirs are not allowed to fill up. That\u2019s so they can capture excessive amounts of water that flow out of the mountains during storms.",
        "Mitt Romney will cast his vote for Ted Cruz in Tuesday\u2019s Utah GOP caucuses, he announced on Facebook Friday afternoon. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the 2012 Republican presidential nominee is rooting for the Texas senator to win the nomination or that he\u2019s endorsing his bid. Instead, the choice is a continuation of Romney\u2019s broader strategy to deny Donald Trump the GOP nomination and force an open convention this summer in Cleveland. And perhaps most important, Romney is arguing that a vote for John Kasich, the only other remaining candidate in the race, could help boost Trump.",
        "Donald Trump is the GOP delegate leader and has the clearest path to the presidential nomination of any remaining candidate. But does he have an electoral path to 270 in November? There\u2019s a basic math problem for any Republican nominee. In every one of the past six presidential elections, Democrats have won states that add up to about 240 electoral votes \u2014 pretty close to the majority needed to win. Republicans have won about 103 electoral votes in each of the past six elections, so there\u2019s a big hill to climb.",
        "Someone yells a ! from the audience in the moment before Margo Price and her backing band, the Price Tags, launch into \u201dTennessee Song.\u201d The tune, from Price\u2019s debut album, Midwest Farmer\u2019s Daughter, stomps like a southern with heavy leads from the harmonica and electric guitar, and a psychedelic that takes the Volunteer State cosmic.

        "Medicare beneficiaries may get dinged with higher prescription drug bills this year because more than half of covered drugs in standalone plans require them to pay a percentage of the cost rather than a flat fee, an analysis from consulting group Avalere Health says. percent of covered drugs in Part D drug plans in 2016 are subject to this coinsurance, the Avalere analysis found. That means patients are on the hook for a percentage of the costs, which can be much higher than a traditional copay, which is flat.",
        "California\u2019s insurance exchange is threatening to cut hospitals from its networks for poor performance or high costs, a novel proposal that is drawing heavy fire from medical providers and insurers. The goal is to boost the overall quality of patient care and make coverage more affordable, said Peter Lee, executive director of the Covered California exchange. \u201dThe first few years were about getting people in the door for coverage,\u201d said Lee, a key figure in the rollout of the federal health law.",
        "The Clan is a mostly true, occasionally comic thriller about an Argentine family that made kidnapping its family business. For a surprisingly long time in the 1980s, the Puccios seemed sincerely convinced that the family that slays together stays together, although you\u2019d never guess that backstory when you meet Alejandro Puccio on screen, scoring a goal in a championship rugby match. He\u2019s the team\u2019s best player, popular, handsome, with a job in his family\u2019s sporting goods store. And also in the family\u2019s other business \u2014 one they don\u2019t talk about.",
        "When it comes to milk production, Gigi the cow is queen. \u201dShe\u2019s the diva of all divas,\u201d says Robert Behnke, a Brooklyn, Wis. dairy farmer and Gigi\u2019s owner. And she\u2019s earned that diva status: Earlier this year, she produced more milk in one year than any other cow had done before \u2014 just shy of 75, 000 pounds of milk, roughly equivalent to 8, 700 gallons. That\u2019s triple the national average for a dairy cow to produce in a year.",
        "John Koethe is not a hip new poet writing about hip new things, but, at 70, he\u2019s deeply worth reading. His tenth collection takes its title \u2014 and the title of one of its best poems \u2014 from the seminal John Cheever story about a suburban man who decides to get home one day by swimming through his neighborhood pools, which he imagines as a river. Koethe reads the story as \u201dA a life from the perspective of disillusionment and age,\u201d and that is essentially what Koethe\u2019s book is, too.",
        "In Brussels, the European Union and Turkey have reached a deal aimed at stemming the massive flow of people into Europe. It will likely impact tens of thousands of migrants and refugees. European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted that the sides unanimously agreed to terms.",
        "Just after President Obama and I concluded our interview \u2014 and after the microphones and cameras clicked off \u2014 he added a thought. Senate Republicans\u2019 vow not to consider the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to the U. S. Supreme Court, he said, could have profound consequences for the high court and the justices themselves. \u201dThe thing that could be lost,\u201d said Obama, is the \u201dcollegiality\u201d of the court, the ability to work together.",
        "President Obama spoke with NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg on Thursday about why he selected Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court, why he thinks the judge deserves a hearing from the Senate and the impact Obama sees for the U. S. judiciary if that doesn\u2019t happen. Nina writes about the conversation here a full transcript is below. NINA TOTENBERG: Mr. President, Judge Garland was twice before. So why now and not twice before? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I think Merrick Garland is one of the best judges, not just in the country, but of his generation.",
        "International pressure on North Korea has ratcheted up in recent days, as the U. S. imposed new unilateral sanctions and China began taking steps to implement a strict, new United Nations Security Council resolution. But while the U. S. has few economic ties with North Korea to cut, China has plenty of screws to tighten. And so whether international sanctions work or fail may depend to a large degree on how strictly China implements them. Beijing has begun instructing Chinese banks, ports and shipping and trading companies doing business with North Korea to implement the U. N.",
        "In a grainy, video, Jan. 1, 1:57 a. m. a shadowy figure in a hallway appears to pull a poster of some sort off a wall and place it on the floor. This, North Korea claims, is the New Year\u2019s Day theft that earned American Otto Warmbier, a University of Virginia student, a sentence of 15 years of hard labor. The footage was released after a brief trial Wednesday in North Korea, during which Warmbier admitted stealing the banner.",
        "It\u2019s standard practice for any talented American director with a flair for spectacle to be hailed as \u201dthe next Steven Spielberg,\u201d though the competition has become especially heated in recent years. J. J. Abrams paid tribute to his idol with Super 8, while Colin Trevorrow delivered a soulless nostalgia trip with last summer\u2019s Jurassic World. But few filmmakers have aligned themselves with Spielberg in such nervy fashion as Jeff Nichols, whose fourth feature, Midnight Special, means to take us back to such wondrous touchstones as E. T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind.",
        "After days of anticipation, a fuzzy wing flopped out of the remains of an egg shell Friday morning, signaling the hatching of a baby bald eagle who\u2019s been watched and fretted over, via an eagle cam set up at the National Arboretum in Washington, D. C. The bird then worked its way out of its shell over the next hour, emerging more fully around 8:20 a. m. ET. Throughout the process, its parent eagle alternated between peering attentively (to be honest, eagles don\u2019t seem capable of anything but) and nestling over the fledgling and a second, egg."
