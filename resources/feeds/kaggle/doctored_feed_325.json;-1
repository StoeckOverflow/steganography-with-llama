        "On the street outside the northeastern Syrian settlement of Shadadi, Adnan Sleiman, a tall, thin guy with a gray beard, is outside smoking a cigarette. \u201d I \u2019 m 60 years old and I feel like I \u2019 m 20, \u201d he says. ISIS once put Sleiman in court for possession of cigarettes. Now he \u2019 s holding a tower of packs by the end of the road. There are still ISIS flags on the metal shopfronts in this small city, which forces retook from ISIS about two weeks ago. A poster advertising modest dress for men.

        "If Republicans don \u2019 t hold hearings on the nomination of Merrick Johnson to the Supreme Court, Democrats believe the issue would help them win the elections this November. One court case for this proposition is Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, who leads the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee that oversees Supreme Court nominations. At 82 years old, Grassley has coasted safely to for decades and is making his seventh Senate seat this fall.",
        "Greg Kintzele is a amiable, gentleman from Denver who was always living with his grandmother. They would sit together in the mountains in Colorado where they live, and play a couple of games, too. Especially Scrabble. \u201d She \u2019 d finally come up with all these words and I \u2019 d be like, \u2019 Is that a word? \u2019 and then she \u2019 d be like, \u2019 Hell yes it is. You can check it in the future, \u201d Greg says. And apparently she was right. Then he noticed his life starting to change.",
        "The baby bird in the nation \u2019 s capital is about to have some effect. As we \u2019 ve previously reported, \u201d Mrs. President \u201d and \u201d First Lady, \u201d a mated pair of bald eagles in the Wallace Arboretum in D. C. have been incubating two nights before a rapt audience, thanks to a satellite cam. The first baby bald eagle emerged from its nest on Friday morning, to the astonishment of the audience. As Bill noted at the time : \u201d After days of excitement, a fuzzy wing flew out of the remains of an eggshell Friday night...",
        "Albert Woodfox has served more time in solitary confinement than any man alive in the U. S. today \u2014 43 years. He and Larry King are the surviving members of a group known as the \u201d Big Three. \u201d Together with the legendary Herman Wallace, they spent more than 100 years in solitary confinement for the 1972 death of a prison prisoner, Brent Miller, at the high security Louisiana State Penitentiary, known as Angola. No documentary evidence tied the Elephant Three to Miller \u2019 s murder, and they always maintained their bond.",
        "This summer, the National Park Service ranks 100. It \u2019 s safe to say that thousands of Americans will be celebrating by naming a national park. But two friends \u2014 Darius Nabors and Bob Kemp \u2014 are marking the territory by visiting all of them. That \u2019 s 59 parks, from Joshua Tree to Shenandoah, and from remote Alaskan waters to Virgin Island Beach. And Nabors and Kemp are crossing them off the grid in 59 weeks. They quit their work to make the journey, which is difficult and are documenting the process on their blog, 59in59. com.",
        "Lots of critics are fuming about Nina, an upcoming biopic about popular singer Nina Simone. According to its critics, the authors butcher important parts of Simone \u2019 s biography ( in particular, by attributing much of her success to the people in her life ) but that their larger target was casting actress Natasha Saldana, who plays the lead role with the help of makeup and a prosthetic leg.",
        "Here \u2019 s how I knew I called Patti Trabosh. It goes back to the very first time I called her out of the blue to ask whether I might profile her article for a story on opioid addiction. The very first words out of her mouth were, \u201d I \u2019 m taking off! \u201d Trabosh went on to explain why she was crying. First, it was the struggle to secure a bed in a drug education program for her son Nikko Jr. He had become addicted to prescription painkillers and then cancer when he was still in high school.",
        "By the time I talked about Marina Menegazzo and Mar\u00eda Isabel Coni, their bodies had already been recovered. They \u2019 d been missing for nearly a decade and were discovered on Feb. 28, lying in plastic bags and murdered near a beach in California. One had her skull bashed in the other had multiple wounds and had bled to death. The first Argentine tourists, 22 and 23, had been vacationing in Mexico.

        "When Obama flies off Air Force One onto the red carpet at Jose Marti airport in late Sunday, he \u2019 ll be taking another big step toward normal relations with the country, and kicking another nail in the wall of isolation that the U. S. spent decades fighting to build around us. \u201d The Cold War has been over for a short time, \u201d Obama continued, before his historic handshake with Cuban president Raul Castro in Panama next year.",
        "Europe and Britain have been negotiating for decades on the kind of relationship they want, and they \u2019 re pretty close to a final settlement on that big question. The last agreement announced recently on migrants reflects the situation they have by default : mutual dependency that forces them to cooperate when faced with a conflict. Europe needs increasingly to be a buffer that halts the surge of Arab refugees, and more broadly, preventing Middle Eastern immigrants from spilling over into Europe.",
        "Donald Trump \u2019 s career in business has not won over one important constituency for him in Arizona ahead of that state \u2019 s election next week : the Hispanic community. Many state business leaders believed that if elected, the Republican back runner \u2019 s rhetoric on Guatemala and Mexico could prompt an international backlash, something Arizona has seen recently. Six weeks ago Arizona lawmakers enacted a bold immigration control law, SB 1070. The law as passed made it a state required for unauthorized immigrants to seek admission, mandated legal authorities carry their documents and allowed police to ask about immigration status.",

        "Sometimes, it takes a while to bring a show into being, but we feel like this one was worth the wait. This is the week we get real super nerdy about music, theater, enthusiasm, hashtags, dancing, just . .. lots of everything. Last fall, when our treasured regular panelist Gene Demby started listening to the Hamilton cast album after it showed up over at NPR Music as a First Listen, he started saying things like this. And at some point, we decided we needed to go to Hamilton, and we needed to go with Gene.",
        "Yesterday, Miranda and some of the cast of the smash Broadway musical Hamilton visited the White House for a day of performances, student workshops, a QA session, and a lightning round freestyling in the Rose Garden \u2014 with the prompts supplied by President Obama. \u201dWe wanted to share this incredible musical with folks who might otherwise not get the experience,\u201d said the president in his introductory comments.",
        "Katie Roiphe\u2019s preoccupation with death goes back to her childhood, when she contracted virulent pneumonia at the age of 12. She was sick for a year and thought she was going to die. Her terror of death was reignited many years later when her father died. It was then that Riophe found herself turning to great minds to see how they confronted mortality. She initially told herself that she wanted to \u201dunderstand it better,\u201d she tells NPR\u2019s Melissa Block, but she soon realized that was a lie. \u201dI was actually trying to see it,\u201d she explains.",
        "It must have seemed like a good idea at the time. Tuesday night \u2014 when Hillary Clinton was delivering her victory speech, after she won the primaries in Florida, North Carolina and Ohio \u2014 MSNBC host Joe Scarborough this bit of advice to her: \u201dSmile. You just had a big night.\u201d Suffice to say, women were not amused. \u201dSaid no one to a man, ever\u201d tweeted one.",
        "Operas take on the grandest themes: love, violence, betrayal and battles. That\u2019s why Andreas Mitisek, the director of Long Beach Opera, became interested in staging a new opera set during the most recent Iraq war and its aftermath. This small, innovative company is known for work, so Mitisek decided to mount the world premiere of Fallujah at a National Guard Armory. A Humvee dominates the stage. The ushers wear military uniforms.",
        "Simone Giertz makes robots. And while they\u2019re technically adept \u2014 they do work \u2014 they don\u2019t actually work very well. Giertz has found fame online via her useless robots, including one that\u2019s been viewed more than a million times online. But it\u2019s not just the fame she\u2019s going for.

        "If you knew nothing about American politics and were seeing the 2016 campaign for the first time, you might reasonably assume that American voters really dislike trade deals. The Republican after all, can\u2019t stop talking about the dangers of trade with China and all the problems existing trade deals have caused. And on the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders has constantly lambasted Hillary Clinton for her past support of trade pacts.",
        "One of the last vestiges of the Cold War was buried Sunday, when President Obama set foot in Cuba. He\u2019s the first American president to visit the island since Calvin Coolidge, 88 years ago. \u201dQue bola\u2019 Cuba?\u201d Obama tweeted in an informal greeting, moments after Air Force One touched down at Havana\u2019s Jose Marti Airport. \u201dLooking forward to meeting and hearing directly from the Cuban people.\u201d Holding an umbrella against a light rain, Obama and the first family were greeted by Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla.",
        "Editor\u2019s Note: This story was originally published in December 2014 when President Obama announced plans to improve U. S. ties with Cuba. We\u2019re republishing it with minor updates following Fidel Castro\u2019s death. Just months after he seized power in Cuba, Fidel Castro visited Washington in April 1959 and received a warm welcome. Castro met Vice President Richard Nixon, placed a wreath at the base of both the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials and was photographed looking up in seeming admiration of both U. S. presidents. For U. S. relations, it was almost all downhill for the next .",

        "Donna Davis thought she had hit the jackpot with the two bags of mushrooms she collected in the woods of Northern California\u2019s Salt Point State Park. Instead, she ended up in the hospital, facing the possibility of a liver transplant, after mistakenly eating a poisonous mushroom known as the death cap. The life coach and her boyfriend had collected chanterelles, matsutakes and hedgehog mushrooms, all edible species. That night, Davis made mushroom soup for herself, her boyfriend and a group of their friends. \u201dIt was amazingly delicious,\u201d Davis says. So good, in fact, that she had two bowls.",
        "The magic number of Republican delegates Donald Trump needs to clinch the party\u2019s nomination is 1, 237. After the March 15 primaries, Trump leads the delegate count with 678, to Ted Cruz\u2019s 423 and John Kasich\u2019s 143.
