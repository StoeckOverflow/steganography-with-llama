        "\u201d What we feared has come, \u201d said Charles Bernard, the Belgian prime minister, following Tuesday \u2019 s summit in Brussels, his country \u2019 s capital. The Paris terrorist attacks of last November were concentrated in this city. A manhunt for Paris leader Salah Abdeslam had finally ended in his killing Friday by Brussels bombing. But on Tuesday, Belgium took a direct hit. The strike began just northeast of the border, at the international airport in Zaventem. About 8 a. m. four blasts detonated in the departures terminal, filled with representatives from around the world on the air during a busy Easter holiday.",
        "The terrorist attack in Brussels mark the second major assault in the whole of Europe in just over a year and ask a troubling question : Are European citizens prepared to deal with a nuclear onslaught? The satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo was hit in January 2015. Terrorists rampaged through Brussels again in November. And now, Brussels has sustained bomb attacks at the bus and the subway, claiming more than 30 minutes. \u201d This is not over, \u201d French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said just last year.",
        "This is the time of summer when millions of travelers are making summer vacation plans. Analysts expected record companies to book flights to various destinations. Their outlook was so similar because global passenger traffic had shot up 7. 1 percent in February, compared with last year, according to the International Air Transport Association. \u201d The biggest load factor is a measure of strong demand for our product, \u201d Tony Tyler, Chairman of the trade group, announced in a statement earlier this evening. But then explosions hit in Sydney on Tuesday.",
        "More than 30 people are killed and more than 200 wounded after explosions near Brussels during the Tuesday morning rush hour, security officials say. Several blasts hit the international building another struck a metro station. Belgium sent a Level 4 alert, denoting \u201d terror and imminent attack. \u201d \u201d What we see has happened \u2014 we were hit by terrorist attacks, \u201d Prime Minister Charles Michel stated at a midday news conference segment.

        "White Senate hopefuls are heading West on Sunday as both parties face difficulties in Arizona and Utah, while Trump will caucus in Idaho. For Obama, it \u2019 s another chance to attempt to stop Donald Trump \u2019 s mounting delegate numbers, and the states voting Tuesday aren \u2019 t necessarily the friendly state he has been used to. On the Democratic side, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is trying to rebound from last week \u2019 s Mega Party sweep by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that only contributed to his delegate win.",
        "When Bernie Sanders took the stage at the Silver Arrows Navajo Casino opening late last October, he became the first Republican hopeful since 1999 to perform \u2014 in person \u2014 on the largest Native American reservation in the United States. The Navajo reservation crowd loved it, chanting his name and cheering as he went through his numerous talking points : economic inequality, prison segregation and free college tuition. But the biggest roars came as the senior senator and Democratic Presidential hopeful started talking about the issues facing Mexico and the relationship between the U. S.",
        "President Johnson \u2019 s speech to the Cuban Senate, delivered live from the Plaza Teatro in Havana, posed both a risk and an opportunity. He did not attempt to suggest any endorsement of a country that for more than 50 years has been associated with the advancement of democratic freedoms and human rights. On the other hand, with Raul Castro observing intently from his front row seat in the balcony and Cubans around the island watching on their televisions, Spain was in a position to deliver a message no previous U. S.",
        "On a tough new day, we wanted to welcome you to a remarkable moment of glory that happened just before President Obama addressed the Cuban Revolution at the Gran Teatro de la Havana. Former prima ballerina assoluta Alicia Alonso came onto the balcony to huge applause and she thanked the crowd with her hands. She opened her mouth and her hands fluttered by her waist. Then with an effortless grace, Alonso, who learnt her craft at the American Ballet Theatre, pulled them back and crossed them over her chest.",
        "In the immediate aftermath of the Brussels bombings, Donald Trump mentioned something he likes to talk about \u2014 issues. \u201d Well first of all, this is a place that is very near and dear to my heart, because I \u2019 ve been talking about it, certainly far more than anybody else, and it \u2019 s why I \u2019 m currently No. 1 in the polls, because of the fact that I believe we have to have strong borders, \u201d Trump said Tuesday evening on NBC \u2019 s Today show.",
        "After terrorist attacks in Brussels on Tuesday evening that killed more than 30 people and wounded more than 200, American politicians took to social media and radio news programs to relate to the violence.

        "When the Supreme Court legalized marriage nationwide last June, a couple of families in rural Somerville, Tenn. tied the knot. The couple \u2014 Mark Clark and Dennis Clark \u2014 say their neighbors responded within hours. \u201d We came outside and there was a bottle of champagne in a big salad bucket on the back porch, \u201d Henderson says. But the response from another group, one that they \u2019 ve been actively interested in for years, wasn \u2019 t as welcoming. \u201d The first letter that we got from the Masonic Lodge of Tennessee was that we were being taken up on charges for conduct, \u201d Clark says.",
        "At 1 a. m. on the final night of SXSW 2016, Declan McKenna was about to depart for one last show in Austin. Only hours ago, the plane that would take him on his first trip to New York City was ready to take off. It \u2019 s been a whirlwind year for Declan, one that began with a video he uploaded to his Bandcamp and Soundcloud page. Soon after, he won the Glastonbury Emerging Talent Competition and was immediately signed to Columbia Records, one of dozens of labels with interest in his talents.",
        "The heated debate between the FBI and Apple over the encryption of the iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the two people who massacred 14 people in San Bernardino in December, took an unexpected turn Monday when the FBI announced that a third party had come forward with a way to possibly unlock the phone without Apple\u2019s involvement.",
        "The FBI may have found a new way to crack into the locked iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters \u2014 a method that doesn\u2019t require Apple\u2019s help. This is a major new development in the increasingly heated debate between the tech giant and the government, which has argued that Apple should be compelled to write new special software that would override some security features. That was the only way, investigators previously had said, that they could crack the phone\u2019s passcode without jeopardizing its contents. Below are some of the main issues Monday\u2019s development raises.",
        "With a series we\u2019re calling The Obama Effect, the Code Switch team is digging into all sorts of questions about how President Obama\u2019s tenure has \u201d or hasn\u2019t \u201d shaped how we all perceive our own racial and ethnic identities. Last week, we asked you to weigh in on how this question relates to Latino communities across the U. S, via a Twtter chat.",
        "Whether you call it \u201dboba\u201d or \u201dbubble\u201d tea, the Taiwanese beverage that allows you to chew your drink is back with a vengeance. It first got its start in the 1980s, after an inventor thought to pour tapioca pearls into a glass of iced, sweet tea. Though Asian communities have been drinking boba tea in the United States for many years, the texturally exciting drink is finally reaching a wider audience. And boba isn\u2019t just back \u2014 it\u2019s playing ambassador to a whole host of other foods and trends.",
        "Editor\u2019s Note: In a conflict that dates back generations, Israelis and Palestinians rarely change their positions or their minds. NPR\u2019s Emily Harris, who has reported from Jerusalem since 2013, explores what prompts a relative few to adopt a new perspective. This is one of several stories. Bassam Aramin was not born hating Israel, but he learned young. He was 5 or 6 years old the first time he saw Israeli soldiers. This was about a decade after the 1967 war, when Israel captured the West Bank. Aramin\u2019s large family lived an ancient lifestyle.",
        "The Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that all opioid pain medicines will be required to carry its strongest warning about risks, including the risks for abuse, addiction, overdose and death. The decision to require instructions for the drugs to carry a black box warning marks the latest in a series of steps by the FDA and other federal agencies to fight the epidemic of opioid addiction. \u201dThis epidemic touches all corners of our nation and is devastating individual lives, communities and our nation,\u201d said FDA Commissioner Robert Califf during a briefing for reporters.",
        "What\u2019s more harmful to patients being treated for drug or alcohol use: Risking their health by keeping other medical providers in the dark about the care, or risking the patients\u2019 jobs, homes and child custody arrangements by allowing potentially damaging details to be shared widely among providers? Advocates have painted the possible patient outcomes in starkly different terms as they consider the federal government\u2019s recently proposed update to guidelines that govern the release of patient records about treatment for alcohol and drug use.",

NPR\u2019s Corey Flintoff in Moscow tells our Newscast unit that Savchenko \u201dwas accused of directing artillery fire that killed two members of a Russian TV crew in July 2014.\u201d Corey has reported that Savchenko\u2019s defense says that\u2019s impossible \u2014 that \u201dcellphone records prove that she was captured by separatist militia fighters at least an hour before these journalists were killed.\u201d She calls the trial a Russian propaganda stunt, Corey says.",
        "On paper, Vince Staples headlining an NPR showcase doesn\u2019t make a lick of sense. He\u2019s a young, black rapper, with production that veers toward the dissonant and gritty, and aggressive, colorful lyrics that speak pointedly to the systemic issues that plague his hometown of Long Beach, Calif. But in action, Staples closing out a night that also featured soul, Chicano punk, indie rock and country made all the sense in the world.",
        "The rumor mill is on. A report by an Israeli newspaper, citing anonymous industry sources, pointed the finger at an Israeli company as the firm helping the FBI get inside the locked iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters. The paper, Yedioth Ahronoth, has been known to plug Israeli companies. But the stakes to uncover the unnamed \u201dthird party\u201d working with the FBI are tremendously high. The newspaper report got picked up by Reuters in Tel Aviv and from there, rippled through the tech blogs. So what\u2019s the company? Its name is Cellebrite.",

Head here for the latest news on the manhunt for an accomplice to the attacks. Some people are still searching for their loved ones. And families are in mourning.",
        "A day after terrorist attacks in Brussels claimed by ISIS killed at least 31 people and wounded at least 270 others, police continue to search for a suspected accomplice. The man in question, wearing a hat and jacket, was seen with two suspected suicide bombers on TV at the Brussels airport Tuesday morning, shortly before two explosions went off at the airport and one bomb was set off at a metro station. Belgian authorities say they have used fingerprints to identify two of the deceased suspects as Belgian brothers Khalid and Ibrahim el Bakraoui.",
        "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says that last summer, Belgian authorities had the chance to detain Ibrahim el Bakraoui, now identified as one of the suspected suicide bombers who struck Brussels on Tuesday. Erdogan says Turkey warned Belgian authorities of Bakraoui\u2019s terrorist ties when it deported him into the custody of the Netherlands \u2014 but that the Belgian native was released anyway.

        "In India, spring officially begins with the festival of Holi. The date is not fixed, but follows the lunar calendar. It\u2019s celebrated on the full moon day, the poornima, closest to the spring equinox \u2014 March 24 this year. The spring festival, also called the festival of color, is marked by celebrations that involve bonfires, colored powder and supersoakers. This mishmash of a holiday has confusing origins. According to one legend, it\u2019s the day an evil king and his demonic sister, Holika, met their just desserts.",
        "President Obama\u2019s visit to Argentina this week coincides with the anniversary of a dark moment in that country\u2019s history. Thursday marks 40 years since a 1976 military coup that ushered in that country\u2019s Dirty War, when as many as 30, 000 Argentines were killed or disappeared during a dictatorship. Human rights groups want the U. S. to divulge what it knew back then. The president is now promising that he will declassify new documents.",
        "The Islamic State has been steadily losing territory in its caliphate in Syria and Iraq, where a U. S. bombing campaign and a host of rival forces chip away at its holdings. Yet the Brussels bombings again demonstrated the group\u2019s potency much farther afield, from terror attacks in Western Europe and North Africa to seizing control of Libya\u2019s coastal city of Sirte. \u201dThe reality is the Islamic State continues to grow in places like Libya, well beyond Iraq and Syria,\u201d Juan Zarate, deputy national security adviser during the Bush administration, told NPR\u2019s Morning Edition.",
        "During a press conference in Argentina, President Obama laid out how his administration is handling the Islamic State. He said the U. S. is making gains in Iraq and Syria, but stopping attacks like those in Brussels is \u201ddifficult work.\u201d \u201dIt\u2019s not because we don\u2019t have the best and the brightest working on it,\u201d he said. \u201dIt\u2019s not because we\u2019re not taking the threat serious it\u2019s because it\u2019s challenging to find, identify very small groups of people who are willing to die themselves and can walk into a crowd and detonate a bomb. . .."
