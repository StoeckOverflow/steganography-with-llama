The American secretary of state commented, \u201d the threat we face from Iraq is real, it is urgent, and it crosses no boundaries. \u201d She outlined a solution to fighting ISIS : increased intervention in Iraq and Syria improved efforts around the globe and ramped up intelligence and security operations within the United Nations.",
        "Presidential candidate Donald Trump, after some interviews, has named a few of his foreign policy advisers. One says he feels that if Trump is elected, foreign heads will persuade him not to follow through on some of his promises. Walid Phares is a writer, CBS News commentator and onetime national security adviser to 2012 Democratic presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Although scores of GOP foreign policy specialists wrote an open letter denouncing various Trump views as \u201d unmoored in reality, \u201d \u201d a recipe for economic ruin, \u201d \u201d inexusable, \u201d or reflecting \u201d the sentiment of a racketeer, \u201d Phares believes he could help the situation.",
        "On the sixth anniversary of the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, the proposed health law was placed before a seemingly divided Federal Court Wednesday. At around this time is the controversial conclusion that most health insurance systems provide women with access to contraceptives at no additional cost. Specifically at issue is whether a certain accommodation the Obama administration has provided for religiously affiliated facilities ( such as universities or hospitals ) actually violates a federal law regarding the free exercise of religion.",
        "One of the blockbuster cases before the Supreme Court this day may very well end up in a tie. Wednesday, the federal judges heard a hearing about the Affordable Care Act \u2019 s lack of free birth control for women. The law specifically gives an automatic license to houses of worship, public churches \u2014 but not nonprofits like private schools and hospitals \u2014 that access to contraceptives. The government gave those nonprofits a workaround, but they argued that it still burdens their free understanding of religion.",
        "The Civil Rights Act bans sex discrimination, but does it cover sexual orientation? The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says it does \u2014 and it wants this issue validated by federal courts. This year, the EEOC filed its lawsuits charging employers with discrimination against gay and lesbian employees. \u201d The company takes the position that discrimination because of sexual orientation is intrinsically a result of sex discrimination, \u201d wrote David Lopez, the organization \u2019 s general counsel.",
        "This week Batman and Superman do battle on TV screens around the studio in the much ballyhooed Batman vs. Superman. Superman is exactly the same Superman he \u2019 s always been. An Old Boy \u2014 albeit from the old Krypton \u2014 fighting for Truth, Truth, you know the rest. Batman, on the other hand, is a little better every time he appears on the scene.

        "Batman has two identities : his costumed, persona and his dual identity as billionaire Bruce Wayne. Right? Or maybe it \u2019 s not quite that simple \u2014 as Chris Weldon compellingly puts forth in The Caped Dragon : Batman and the Rise of Nerd Culture. The to his 2013 book Superman : The Unauthorized World, this new superhero hero peeks under the iconic cowl to unveil the many faces of Batman \u2014 as well as the many faces of his millions of years \u2014 since the character \u2019 s creation 77 years ago.",

It \u2019 s just that your food is too real. Hollywood food stylists use all kinds of cheats to make their dishes look perfectly delectable on camera \u2014 without incorporating completely inedible parts. They garnish roasted meat with motor oils to make it glisten just so, redden fruit with butter and sub in glue for milk.

        "When California \u2019 s law takes effect this day, terminally ill patients who want to end their lives would be faced with a hefty bill for the expensive medication. It retails for more than $ 3, 000. Valeant Pharmaceuticals, the company that develops the drug most commonly used in suicide, doubled the product \u2019 s price last December, one month after local lawmakers proposed legalizing the practice. \u201d It \u2019 s just pure company greed, \u201d said Frank Grube, a family doctor in Colorado, where death has been legal for 20 years.

Many said they came in solidarity with Belgium, that the violence was in their thoughts and prayers. President Obama said America would do all it could to help bring the perpetrators to justice.

        "Theoretically speaking, there is widespread confusion about the word \u201dtheory.\u201d Right? Many people interpret the word as iffy knowledge, based mostly on speculative thinking. It is used indiscriminately to indicate things we know \u2014 that is, based on solid empirical evidence \u2014 and things we aren\u2019t sure about. Not a good mix at all, especially when certain theories speak directly to people\u2019s religious and sensitivities, such as the \u201dtheory of evolution\u201d or \u201dBig Bang theory.\u201d There is also the danger of falling for meaning traps set by groups with specific agendas.",

His family said in a statement that Phife died as a result of complications from diabetes. NPR\u2019s Andrew Limbong tells our Newscast unit that Phife, who was one of two main vocalists for A Tribe Called Quest, brought a lot of humor to the group. \u201dThere was a charm to Phife\u2019s lyrics \u2014 he was always making fun of his appearance,\u201d Andrew reports.",
        "North Korea watchers haven\u2019t been getting much sleep this year. The Kim Jong Un regime started the year with a literal bang \u2014 a nuclear test on Jan. 7, marking its fourth such test in the past decade. That was followed by a rocket launch in February, and claims that it had a miniaturized nuclear warhead.

        "Experiencing the world as a different gender than the one assigned to you at birth can take a toll. Nearly all research into transgender individuals\u2019 mental health shows poorer outcomes. A study looking specifically at transgender women, predominantly women of color, only further confirms that reality. What\u2019s less clear, however, is whether trans individuals experience more mental distress due to external factors, such as discrimination and lack of support, or internal factors, such as gender dysphoria, the tension resulting from having a gender identity that differs from the one assigned at birth.",
        "Vice President Biden said Thursday that President Obama, in an effort to win confirmation from a Republican Senate, had named a more moderate judge to the U. S. Supreme Court than he might otherwise have done. In a speech at the Georgetown University Law Center, Biden said the unwillingness of the Republican majority to reciprocate in any way threatens to move congressional dysfunction to the Supreme Court. The vice president said President Obama made a deliberate decision to consult with the Republican leadership and tailor his choice, in part, to allay GOP concerns. \u201dWe\u2019ve reached out,\u201d Biden said.",

        "The bombings in Brussels this week were the third major terrorist attack in Western Europe since the beginning of 2015 and raised the question of how well countries are gathering and sharing intelligence. Gen. Michael Hayden, who headed both the CIA and the National Security Agency, says some European intelligence agencies are good at the gathering part, but the Continent as a whole falls short when it comes to sharing. \u201dThe quickest path to get information around Europe was to tell the Americans,\u201d Hayden tells NPR\u2019s Morning Edition.

        "Two days after terrorist attacks in Brussels killed at least 31 people and injured hundreds more, Belgian authorities continue to search for a suspect seen on surveillance footage. And Belgium enters its second day of mourning, with an country grieving across divisions of language and politics.

        "Blink, and you\u2019d miss the little airstrip surrounded by farmland and tiny, villages in northeastern Syria. There are no checkpoints outside it. Nothing to stop people driving past \u2014 just two Syrian Kurdish guards out front, smoking cigarettes. The strip itself is just visible behind berms that earth movers are bolstering. The Pentagon denies it has \u201dtaken over\u201d this airstrip. But local people and officials say aircraft regularly fly in and out of it, and a U. S. spokesman concedes that a small number of U. S. military advisers inside Syria do need resupply from time to time.",
