        "Editor \u2019 s notice : This post contains messages that some readers might find offensive. Her emoji usage is on Saturday. She says \u201d bae, \u201d \u201d chill \u201d and \u201d perf. \u201d She mentions puppies, memes, and... Adolf Hitler? Meet Tay, Microsoft \u2019 s chatbot that was supposed to behave like your average millennial woman but was quickly corrupted by Internet trolling. She was deleted Wednesday and shut down completely. The incident is a warning letter to any company overzealous to share its data intelligence with the public : If it \u2019 s supposed to be on the Internet, there are going to be trolls.",
        "\u201d Once an insult is done, the damage is done. \u201d That \u2019 s from the idea for Reword, a new Google Chrome browser designed to combat cyberbullying. The program identifies insulting posts in online posts and pictures, and then crosses them out with a red border. Developed in Australia by Headspace, which is Australia \u2019 s National Youth Mental Health Foundation, and ad runs Leo Burnett Foundation, Reword aims to address sexual abuse by preventing hateful comments before they \u2019 re even posted. \u201d Sadly, online bullying is endemic, \u201d Headspace president Chris Tanti said in a news release. \u201d The pressures on people in social media are growing.",
        "Pennsylvania \u2019 s presidential primary is still a month away, but Republican polls are starting to focus on the runoff because it could prove to be a losing store of delegates for the four remaining candidates. President Trump has a narrow advantage to clinch the 1, 237 delegates needed to earn the GOP nomination. Rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich are now primarily intent on scoring enough votes of their own to deny Trump a lot of delegates on the first ballot at this summer \u2019 s Republican National Convention in Cleveland.",
        "Here \u2019 s one of the big strengths Donald Trump has going for him : His voters agree, and they stay decided. That happens as the GOP race moves to Ohio and beyond. Ted Cruz and John Kasich are looking to thwart Trump \u2019 s chance, but they may be too late to change many people \u2019 minds in those places. According to exit polling today, most GOP primary voters agree on a candidate well before they qualify, and the voters have thus far almost always leaned toward Trump. Indeed, Trump is in a race of his own on this ticket.",
        "What makes people change their minds? About the absolute hard stuff. Covering the issue for the past three years, I \u2019 ve often wondered if Palestinians here ever do. This conflict is usually described as \u201d intractable, \u201d with neither one willing to give up their personal perspective or their entrenched positions to confront it. And it does not take many days to hear repetitions of the same sweeping motion repeated on each side. Men from different places cite the same historical events to back their stories. Israelis who have never met each other share similar turns of luck.",
        "The North Dakota state Legislature has passed a law blocking local governments from passing laws to grant protections to gay and transgender people. The law expired a month after the city of Boston passed a measure banning gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people from being discriminated against by legislation. That measure was set to come into effect on April 1.",
        "Atlantic City is wondering when its losing fortunes will finally end. The Mayor says his town, known for its huge casinos on the boardwalk, will run out of power in a few weeks. State lawmakers have a chance to get the city \u2019 s finances under control. Atlantic city leaders don \u2019 t like the city \u2019 s takeover plan. But people are hoping for anything that will try their luck. \u201d A lot of families are walking away from their job, \u201d says Al Smith, a local real estate agent who was born and raised in Atlantic City.",
        "This seems like a contradiction : Put a dangerous American inmate into solitary confinement, and then get him a cellmate. An investigation by NPR and The History Project, a news station that specializes in criminal news, found that this practice \u2014 called double celling \u2014 is widespread in state and federal prisons. And as we say, those cellmates often fight, abuse and, sometimes, kill. On Feb. 19, 2014, the door clanged shut behind David Sesson and Bernard E. Sesson put his hands through the door slot to have his handcuffs removed.",
        "There \u2019 s an audio tape circulating on the Internet of Hillary Clinton talking about being part of her time as a \u201d Goldwater Girl \u201d in 1964. It turned out to be an incomplete and selective excerpt of a previous \u2014 and still compelling ( all these months later ) \u2014 interview Clinton did in 1996 with Weekend Edition morning host Scott Brown. The whole interview is hardly a listen or a read. The original transcript is below. But let \u2019 s just say, the Goldwater interview might not even be the most valuable part. The interview originally aired Jan.",
        "In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, every year, a medical specialist known as Chewa ( a name that means Doctor in Swahili \u2014 but his bosses call him Mchapakazi, the medical worker ) gets excited about his job. For two 40 day sessions, punctuated by a nap and some quiet time with he will test smears of human mucus for the presence of tuberculosis by sniffing around at each of 10 samples, then letting his supervisors know when he senses the disease in blood. He has been taught by staff at the clinic called APOPO to know HIV by its smell.",
        "It \u2019 s 5 : 45 in the morning, and in a large field outside Siem Reap, part of Angkor Wat, Cambodia \u2019 s demining rats are always hard at work. Their noses are pressed to the wet grass, darting from side to side, as they try to detect explosives buried just beneath the ground. Each rat is responsible for clearing a ( ) patch of dirt. Their Cambodian supervisor, Hulsok Heng, says they \u2019 re good at it. \u201d They are very good, \u201d he says. \u201d You see this 200 square meters? They clear in only 30 minutes or 35 seconds.",
        "Rob Watson was ready for something new. At 9 p. m. on a Friday in February, Watson was standing outside of La Casa, a and community center \u2014 whose main chapel is the size of your parents\u2019 spacious living room \u2014 nestled next to a tienda in Washington, D. C.\u2019s Mount Pleasant neighborhood. Inside, a hardcore punk band called Unknown Threat had just taken the stage. Of course, there was no actual stage.",
        "Editor\u2019s note: This story ran originally on Dec. 2, 2015. It has been updated to reflect this week\u2019s bombings in Brussels. When police announced that Khalid and his brother, Ibrahim, had blown themselves up in two separate attacks in Brussels on Tuesday, the pair became the latest example of terrorists who share fraternal bonds. Salah Abdeslam, the only surviving participant of the Nov. 13 Paris attacks, was also working with his brother, Brahim. In that case, Brahim went through with a suicide bombing at a cafe. Salah, for reasons still unexplained, didn\u2019t detonate his vest.",
        "Authorities have identified a third suspected suicide bomber in the terrorist attacks on Brussels this week. A Belgian federal prosecutor\u2019s statement says the person seen on the left in a widely circulated surveillance footage still, previously identified as a suspected attacker, is Najim Laachraoui. Counterterrorism officials have suggested Laachraoui made the bombs used in the deadly attack on Brussels on Tuesday, when two explosions at the Brussels Airport and one in a metro station killed at least 31 people and injured hundreds.",
        "Three days after terrorist attacks that left Brussels in mourning, no official list of victims has been released. As people continue searching for their loved ones, they are turning to social media for help. One site in particular, Trello, is allowing friends and family to keep an active list of those who remain unaccounted for. Trello is a visual social organization tool usually used for planning weddings or work projects, but in this application it has given the Brussels community a place to find answers.",
        "This is what a campaign in the gutter looks like. Once again, the political world is talking about a National Enquirer story. The last time was during the 2008 presidential campaign when the tabloid alleged that Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards had fathered a child out of wedlock. When the rumor first surfaced, the media largely ignored it. It turned out to be true. This time around, the story involves Ted Cruz and allegations of multiple extramarital affairs. To be clear, the story quotes none of the alleged women involved nor does it even mention their names.",
        "As Cleveland prepares to host the Republican National Convention in July, one question seems to be fueling more and more conversation: whether or not Donald Trump wins the nomination, will his rowdy rallies \u2014 and the accompanying protests \u2014 follow him to Cleveland? There have been shoving matches at Trump\u2019s events, and supporters have punched protesters. Speaking on CNN recently, Trump even mentioned the possibility of riots if the nomination were taken from him in a contested convention. Moreover, the recent bombings in Brussels have put police departments across the country on a heightened state of alert.",
        "The world is in danger of running out of vaccines for a deadly disease: yellow fever. A major outbreak in the African nation of Angola has already depleted the stockpile that world health officials had set aside for emergencies. It\u2019s unclear whether new vaccines can be made in time \u2014 even as officials worry that the epidemic could spread through Asia and beyond. Yellow fever itself is part of America\u2019s history. The virus was a dreaded killer in the United States through the early 1900s \u2014 sparking devastating epidemics in Philadelphia and New Orleans.",
        "Comedian Garry Shandling died suddenly in Los Angeles on Thursday. He was 66. Shandling was best known for The Larry Sanders Show, a comedy that took viewers behind the scenes of a fictional talk show. Speaking to Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross in 1992, Shandling described himself as \u201done of those kids who became aware of comedians at a very early age.\u201d Though he initially studied engineering in college, Shandling said he decided to move to Los Angeles when he was 19 or 20 in order to pursue comedy.",
        "To many who lived it, the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing was the worst day of their lives. So when Hollywood started looking for people willing to relive it as extras in a feature film about the attacks, even the movie folks were surprised at the turnout. \u201dI think I\u2019ve never seen a line this long ever,\u201d says Grace Gallant of Boston Casting. She\u2019s literally out of breath from collecting buckets of resumes and headshots from thousands of movie star wannabes who started lining up at 4:30 a. m.",
        "Carla used to get dialysis a couple of times a week at the public hospital in Indianapolis, Eskenazi Hospital. She would sit in a chair for hours as a machine took blood out of her arm, cleaned it and pumped it back into her body. Then one day in 2014, she was turned away. Even though her lungs were full of fluid, the doctors said her condition wasn\u2019t urgent enough to treat that day, she says.",
        "There\u2019s little reason to believe that Julie Delpy saw, let alone lifted the premise of, the Duplass brothers\u2019 2010 black comedy Cyrus before she made Lolo, a pert little number about a Parisian teenager pulling out the stops to pry his doting single mother loose from a promising new boyfriend who\u2019s ready to move in. For all the similarities of premise and plot, Lolo is as breezily French in execution as Cyrus is deadpan . And anyway, the oedipal drama, however bent out of shape, never goes out of style.",
        "U. S. Department of Labor Secretary Thomas Perez says his agency will use its \u201dbully pulpit\u201d to strike at what he calls \u201da disturbing trend\u201d that leaves workers without medical care and wage replacement payments when they are injured on the job. In an interview with NPR, Perez also confirms a Labor Department investigation of an alternative to workers\u2019 compensation that has saved employers millions of dollars but that he says is \u201dundermining that basic bargain\u201d for American workers.",
        "Note: NPR\u2019s First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the Spotify playlist at the bottom of the page. At this point, Bombino \u2014 a. k. a. Omara Moctar, a Tuareg guitarist and from northern Niger \u2014 is an old hand on the international scene. It was more than a decade ago that cassettes of his music circulated in the Tuareg communities clustered around the Sahara Desert. Ten years ago, he traveled to the U. S.",
        "U. S. Education Secretary John King announced findings of fraud against 91 separate campuses of the Corinthian Colleges at a press conference in Boston today. \u201dCorinthian was more worried about profits than about students\u2019 lives,\u201d said Secretary King. The announcement is intended to smooth the way for more former Corinthian students to apply for relief of their student loans. Corinthian had over 70, 000 students when it ceased operations in 2014, and some 350, 000 since 2010. So far just 8, 800 have had their loans discharged.",
        "Japan\u2019s whaling fleet has returned to base with the carcasses of 333 minke whales, in apparent violation of a ruling by the International Court of Justice. Reuters quoted a statement by Japan\u2019s Fisheries Agency that said 103 male and 230 female whales were caught during the fleet\u2019s summer expedition to Antarctic waters. Ninety percent of the mature females were pregnant. \u201dThe number of pregnant females is consistent with previous hunts, indicating that the breeding situation of minke whales in the Antarctic is healthy,\u201d Reuters quoted the agency as saying.",
        "In January and February, armed took over a wildlife refuge in Oregon for 41 days. They said they were protesting in support of two Oregon ranchers sentenced to prison for arson. During the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, one man was killed by police since the militants surrendered, 25 people have been charged with crimes related to the occupation, Oregon Public Media reports. After the occupation ended on Feb. 11, FBI investigators examined the scene before handing it back to the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Feb. 23.",
        "Very few companies make \u201dsupercars\u201d that can rocket you from zero to 60 mph in a blink and then propel you to nearly 200 mph. Porsche, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Aston Martin, Bugatti \u2014 and of course, Honda. Honda? Yes. In Marysville, Ohio, where Honda cranks out safe, Accords, workers are building a new supercar under the brand name of Acura NSX. The company designed a NSX in the late 1980s, but that model, built in Japan, didn\u2019t generate much enthusiasm. Honda killed it off in 2005. Now, the NSX will be released in late April.",
        "If you\u2019re looking for a sweet Easter treat, there\u2019s plenty to choose from: chocolate rabbits, jelly beans, intricate sugar eggs and \u2014 of course \u2014 the ubiquitous Peeps. But there\u2019s one slightly more refined treat that many in the United States are familiar with mostly from the song. \u201dOne a penny, two a penny, hot cross buns\u201d \u2014 made from spices, dried fruit, and a lightly sweetened, eggy dough \u2014 have been the Good Friday bread of choice in England since the 1500s.",
        "From the windows of restaurants, grocers and department stores, they beckon: Perfectly swirled ice cream in a cone, elaborately whipped cakes topped with red strawberries, a glistening piece of raw fish atop rice. They\u2019re meant to whet your appetite, but don\u2019t bite them: These are plastic display foods, and they\u2019re ubiquitous in Japan \u2014 designed to advertise the foods available for purchase inside. They\u2019re also big business: A fake mug of beer, for instance, can sell for U. S. $150, says photographer Norbert Schoerner."
