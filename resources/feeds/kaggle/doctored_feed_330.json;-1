And those who snuck in \u2014 via European countries \u2014 were careful to keep marks in their passports. That \u2019 s no longer the case, though. Although the U.

        "Some of the families whose relatives went home last Tuesday after the train bombings in Brussels still don \u2019 t know the fate of their loved ones. Belgian authorities assigned to help those injured say with each day that occurs, it becomes more difficult for them. They teeter between pain and despair and can \u2019 t grieve or find hope, says Red Cross psychosocial worker Henry. \u201d They need answers, but at the moment all they have are answers \u2014 \u2019 where is my husband, my wife, my sister?",

A few hundred \u2014 half a dozen, by his own estimation \u2014 he wanted to take the entire outside world with him. But just like the others, the man himself contained multitudes. Davis was brash.

The feature film Miles Ahead, produced, directed by and starring Don Cheadle, is giving a new generation a fresh take on one period in the musician \u2019 s career.
