        "SodaStream was at the heart of a campaign in the Middle East twenty years ago. The manufacturing company, which makes a simple gadget to turn plain bread into a flavored, carbonated drink at home, comes under pressure for being an Israeli corporation operating in the West Bank. groups argue that Jewish businesses located there give support to the Israeli occupation of the land Palestinians claim for their state.

        "Opioids are becoming the latest serious addiction drug in this country. Among these drugs manufactured from opium, heroin is the most toxic, dangerous, cheap and expensive everywhere. In April \u2019 s issue of Harper \u2019 s Magazine, Dan Baum has examined a new approach to this latest addiction problem : the legalization of drugs. NPR \u2019 s Adam Wertheimer asks Baum about how he began to delve into the cause of America \u2019 s war on drugs and why he calls attempts at legalization a bigger risk based on our approaches to solving the widespread problems.",
        "You \u2019 ll soon learn whether many of the snack foods you buy include ingredients derived from genetically modified plants, such as soybeans and honey. Over the past week or so, several companies including General Mills, Mars and Kellogg have announced plans to label such companies \u2014 even though they probably don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s a good thing. The reason, in a word, is money. The tiny state has boxed many food companies into a grid. Two years later, the state passed laws requiring mandatory labeling.",
        "John B. King Jr was also confirmed by the Senate as the fifth U. S. Secretary of Defense for the remainder of President Bush \u2019 s term, succeeding Arne Burns. With a slew of pressing issues from to personal debt, I wanted to figure out what King thinks he can get done in such a short space of time. Here \u2019 s our conversation. You \u2019 ve got just 10 months left in President Obama \u2019 s term to fully close the equity and debt gaps, promote jobs and opportunity, and implement the Texas Student Succeeds Act. Good luck with that!",
        "The public and personal dispute between the government and Apple is officially over after the FBI fail to unlock the iPhone stolen by one of the San Francisco terrorists without Obama \u2019 s help. The Justice Department says it has successfully extracted the data from the phone and is requesting the court to vacate its order for NSA \u2019 s assistance. \u201d Our decision to review the litigation was based mainly on the fact that, with the recent assistance of a third party, we are now going to unlock that iPhone without compromising any information on the phone, \u201d U.

        "On a dry December morning, I set out to catch the man who may even be Cambodia \u2019 s last remaining elephant catcher. Elephant catching is a tradition in parts of the country \u2014 or perhaps a hobby. They say that years ago, men would come out to lasso a baby elephant and drag the animal back to the ground, to live with them and carry their daily loads. I heard stories about elephant catchers while working as a businessman in Cambodia, covering heavy logging. Naturally, I was curious.",

The HTC Vive will be out next fall and Sony PlayStation VR will be coming in the fall. Since 2010, $ 4 million has gone into virtual reality, according to market analyst firm PitchBook, and tens of thousands of dollars are pouring into devices that make content for those headsets. Over the past couple of years, I \u2019 ve got every experience I could get my hands on \u2014 most recently in Austin at the South by Southwest conference.",
        "The consumer augmented reality headset, Oculus Rift, is finally dominating the market. The reviews have been positive. As The Wall Street Journal put it, \u201d the first truly immersive home virtual reality rig is a pricey, awkward, isolating \u2014 and occasionally brilliant \u2014 glimpse of the wonders of computing. \u201d But behind this naive child of virtual reality products is a man, Tom Luckey, who invented the device while still in his teens and founded the brand Oculus VR, which is now owned by Facebook.",
        "Organic farming has gone majorly mainstream, eh? has been driving down the price of anything with an organic line. General Foods has begun working with cheaper stores to back up. And the increase in sales of fresh food has dramatically outpaced that of fresh food. What \u2019 s more, 30 percent of shoppers express an interest in paying more for fresh food \u2014 and a significant interest even in neighborhoods. Given all that, it \u2019 s easy to assume that food has become just as common in downmarket groceries as in upscale businesses.",
        "U. S. Capitol Police shot a man at the Capitol Visitor Center on Friday afternoon after he drew a revolver during a routine security check, Chief of the U. S. Capitol Police Matthew Verderosa said at a news conference. Verderosa believed the man pulled \u201d what appeared to be a weapon \u201d and an officer charged him.

        "Anthony Hamilton \u2019 s soul sound was popular in the churches of Charlotte, N. C. Watching the prize winner perform, you get the hunch that it \u2019 s harder for him to keep the rage inside than it is to actually unleash it. What he and his backup singers, The Hamiltones, do would be widely classified as a musical purge, with a live show that can double as art therapy and church music. Their warm harmonies have the ability to fill theaters and stadiums, so we knew this church setting was perfect for them.",
        "How do you fix a problem if you don\u2019t know its size? Many states \u2014 including some that have been hardest hit by the opioid crisis \u2014 don\u2019t know how many of their youngest residents each year are born physically dependent on those drugs. They rely on estimates. Pennsylvania is one of those states. Ted Dallas, head of Pennsylvania\u2019s Department of Human Services, calls the information he\u2019s working with \u201dreasonably good.\u201d \u201dData is never pristine when you\u2019re dealing with 2. 7 million people,\u201d he says.",
        "Amanda Hensley started abusing prescription painkillers when she was just a teenager. For years, she managed to function and hold down jobs. She even quit opioids for a while when she was pregnant with her now son. But she relapsed. Hensley says she preferred drugs like Percocet and morphine, but opted for heroin when she was short on cash. By the time she discovered she was pregnant last year, she couldn\u2019t quit.",
        "Turn on the radio in Belgium and you get news of the terrorist attacks in French and in Dutch. Belgium is divided into Flanders and Wallonia. There\u2019s a area, too. To make things more complicated, Brussels, the capital, is subdivided into 19 municipalities, each with its own government. And there are six local police forces. It all adds up to a decentralized system, a dismantled federal state. And in light of last week\u2019s attacks, some have even gone so far as to suggest Belgium is a failed state.",
        "At the dilapidated morgue in the northern Brazilian city of Natal, Director Marcos Brandao walks over the floor to where the corpses are kept. He points out the labels attached to the bright metal doors, counting out loud. It has not been a particularly bad night, yet there are nine shooting victims in cold storage. Most were shot with guns that were not legally owned, he says. Almost 60, 000 people were murdered in Brazil in 2014, most with guns.",

        "Most people have a colleague or two who don\u2019t seem to do much work at work. They\u2019re in the break room watching March Madness, or they disappear for a coffee break. For Allison Lamb, that person is her cubicle mate. Lamb is a statistical clerk for a company in Fishers, Ind. who says she likes her job and has a good work ethic.

        "When it comes to babies, people don\u2019t always think clearly. I don\u2019t mean that they erupt into baby talk and make funny faces, though that can happen, too. It\u2019s more that babies elicit a strong set of cultural assumptions and values that can influence our thinking, for better and for worse. Take an example from last week, when Peretz Partensky, a San entrepreneur, wrote about the experiences of his Na\u2019ama Moran, fundraising in Silicon Valley while pregnant. The article sparked a heated discussion at Hacker News.",
        "Today, more than 11 million families spend over half of their incomes on rent, and for the poor, it can be as much as 80 percent.

        "I was feeling cheeky one afternoon when I posted to Facebook that the \u201990s hit \u201dBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s\u201d was the worst song of all time. It had been nearly two decades since the release of that single \u2014 about a bickering couple who reconcile thanks to an Audrey Hepburn film \u2014 but I heard the chorus in passing that day, and it got stuck on this loop in my brain.
