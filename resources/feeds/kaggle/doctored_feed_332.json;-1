        "Belgium even ran a simulation campaign at Brussels \u2019 Zaventem Airport to figure out if it can at least partially reopen using new security measures demanded by the government. It \u2019 s been a month since the March 22 Belgium bombings at the airport and on a street several miles offshore. Since then, no commercial flights have gone in or out of this European area and it \u2019 s unclear when air operations will resume. Parts of the Berlin subway have reopened, though soldiers wearing masks and armed with assault rifles conduct random traffic checks that include patdowns and car searches.",
        "Author Barbara Orenstein says that when it comes to girls, girls today are leaving mixed messages. People hear that \u201d they \u2019 re supposed to be performing, they \u2019 re supposed to perform better for boys, \u201d Orenstein tells Bel Air \u2019 s Terry Jones, \u201d but that their sexual pleasure is unspoken. \u201d While publishing her new book, Baby Sex, Orenstein spoke with more than 70 different women between the ages of 15 and 20 about their experiences and early experiences with the wide range of physical activity. She says that pop music and pornography sexualize young girls by creating undue pressure to look and act sexy.",
        "You never forget who you \u2019 re going to meet at a party. In the case of one gay man and woman, a mass celebration in New York City led not just to a large affair \u2014 it became part of the fabric of modern culture. I was going to Havana on a long trip to cover a Cuban music festival, and I saw a translator. Through a friend of a friend of a friend, I met Gabriela Burdsall. She \u2019 s a part of Cuba \u2019 s national classical dance troupe. As it turns out, Gabriela had her own, nearly unbelievable tale to tell.",
        "On July 8, 2011, the space shuttle Atlantis flew off its launch platform and sailed skyward, marking the last time we sent Americans into orbit using our own rockets fired from our own soil. Since then, our time to orbit ( and the Space Shuttle ) has come via cash bought on Russian investments in Russian crew capsules. If all went well, this reliance on NASA may end in 2017. That \u2019 s when many space companies, through collaboration with NASA, begin putting American astronauts into space with Russian technology once again.",
        "At the Caracas Paper Co. founded in 1953, printing presses and cutting equipment used to churn out 13, 000 tons of notebooks, manila folders and envelopes every year. Now, it produces less than half that amount. That \u2019 s linked to a paper shortage as well as frequent power outages. The blackouts can last up to three hours, says production manager Ricardo Lamarca. And they come just as the government is encouraging Venezuelan businesses to clean up production and help maintain the economy. \u201d The machinery shuts down. There \u2019 s no electricity, so the bathrooms don \u2019 t work.",

        "Just over a year ago, a coalition started a massive offensive in Yemen in favor of the country \u2019 s embattled President Mohamed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. The coalition airstrikes are aimed at pushing back the Shiite Houthi rebels, who struck down from northern Yemen in 2014 and took control of major portions of the country. But it \u2019 s not just two warring factions \u2014 southern separatists and powerful businessmen also have a stake in the economy. And an branch and a burgeoning ISIS affiliate have retreated from the violence. And Yemen \u2019 s allies have been caught in the middle with devastating consequences.",

        "On this week \u2019 s version of All Songs Considered, Bob lifts Robin Hilton out of his recent NCAA March Madness depression after his Jayhawks lose form again. Bob plays a piece from Explosions In The Sky. Robin brings us to new music from punk veterans Wire and a new song from Lost Cosmos but they all seem to simply taunt his memory. We also hear a beautiful new song from DJ Slant that features Felix Walworth, the bassist for Eskimeaux, Florist and Bellows.",
        "What \u2019 s the first rule of learning? Paying attention. Which may be hard for students to do when they \u2019 re still peeking at their phones. So, as the adage goes : If you can \u2019 t call \u2019 em, join \u2019 us. One app that teachers are embracing is Snapchat. That \u2019 s the one where you send a message or picture, and then it disappears 10 minutes after you open it. For some teachers, it makes sense. Their students are currently using it. Snapchat has around 100 million users worldwide and, according to one estimate, 77 percent of college students use it daily.",
        "Every Sunday for weeks, Meagen Limes made the same phone call : to a court in Washington, D. C. to see if that week was the day she \u2019 d be evicted from her home. Limes resisted eviction because she couldn \u2019 t pay rent on her home in Southeast Washington, where many of the city \u2019 s poorest residents lived. It can sometimes take time before the marshals actually show up at your house, and Limes fully expected to be charged any day. \u201d And it \u2019 s like real scary, \u201d the said. \u201d I tried so hard not to cry.",
        "Imagine Life and the City, but instead of New York City, the remake takes place in Accra, Ghana. This remix is called An African City, a Ghanaian series that started on YouTube two months ago. The girlfriends are five famous African women living abroad who have returned home to continue careers, search for love and have sex. Lots of sex. The very first episode opens with passengers deplaning at Ghana \u2019 s Kotoka International Airport at night. Among them is the show \u2019 s main character, Nana Yaa, who \u2019 s returning to \u201d the continent \u201d after growing up in New York since age 7.",
        "Donald Trump said women who undergo abortions should be punished if the procedure is made illegal. In an interview for a town hall meeting to air on MSNBC Wednesday night, Trump said \u201dthere has to be some form of punishment\u201d for women. While most Republican officeholders and candidates oppose abortion rights, few have publicly stated positions on whether there should be legal penalties for women who have abortions. Most believe it is the physicians who perform them who should be prosecuted.",
        "If someone tells you the same thing five times, you probably should believe he means it. Back in August, Donald Trump and all the other Republican candidates were given the chance to say they would pledge support to whomever the Republican nominee would be \u2014 and not wage an independent bid for the presidency if he or she didn\u2019t win. Trump raised his hand, the only one on stage to do so, to say he would not make that pledge.",
        "Scientists have discovered a 305 arachnid that is \u201dalmost a spider\u201d in France. In a new journal article, they say the fossil sheds some light on the origins of \u201dtrue\u201d spiders. The main point of distinction: This newly discovered arachnid very likely could produce silk but lacked the spinnerets used by true spiders to, well, spin it, the scientists say. The researchers say it belongs to a \u201dsister group\u201d to the spiders. The species, which they described in a new article in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, is named Idmonarachne brasieri.",
        "Body language can be a dead giveaway of where you\u2019re from. People can tell whether you\u2019re from Australia or the U. K. by the way you smile. They can tell whether you\u2019re from China or Egypt by the way you count using your fingers. And they know whether you\u2019re American or German depending on how you express sympathy. But when it comes to expressing negative emotions, our body language might be much more universal than we realize.",
        "Every election, there\u2019s that chorus of people who insist they are moving to Canada if candidate wins. Everyone knows these people. They\u2019re tweeting and Googling about it as you read this. One Nova Scotia island is even specifically appealing to the crowd. And, yeah, some people actually follow through with it. The Guardian dug up one such couple earlier this year. Another immigration lawyer tells NPR that he has definitely seen this happen on a wider scale.",
        "Last November, a couple from Washington, D. C. took a weeklong vacation. They visited Mexico, Guatemala and Belize. And got bitten by plenty of mosquitoes. Two days after they returned home, the woman \u2014 who was pregnant \u2014 fell ill. She had muscle pain, a fever and a rash. \u201dAt first she didn\u2019t think much about it,\u201d says Rita Driggers, who saw the woman at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \u201dBut then all the news started coming out about Zika, so the woman went and got tested.\u201d The test came back positive.",
        "Just how, exactly, could we wipe out a species of mosquito? That\u2019s the question some of our readers wanted to know after reading our story that pondered the fate of the mosquito that carries the Zika virus, the Aedes aegypti. Would attempting to eliminate them be a good thing, or would it somehow backfire the ways things often do when humans meddle with nature? Most scientists we interviewed, as it turns out, would be all right with saying goodbye to the species. Aedes aegypti carries other deadly diseases harmful to humans, like yellow fever and dengue.",

M. frontman Michael Stipe made a rare public appearance last night to perform a strangely airy version of David Bowie\u2019s \u201dThe Man Who Sold The World\u201d on The Tonight Show. The performance comes ahead of two David Bowie tribute concerts taking place in New York City later this week, one at Carnegie Hall on Thursday, March 31 and one at Radio City Music Hall on Friday.

        "Ben Guerdane is a dusty town in Tunisia\u2019s south, just 20 miles from the border with Libya, a roiling nation of militias and guns galore. It\u2019s a smuggling town, and it depends on the nearly border with Libya to survive. In more normal times, it\u2019s everyday products that get smuggled, but these days something more nefarious is coming across that border \u2014 weapons and militants. The spillover from the conflict in Libya is setting off alarm bells in Tunisia, threatening a fragile democracy in the one place that emerged from the 2011 Arab revolts as a bright spot.",
        "The FDA has updated the labeling for the drug Mifeprex, allowing it to be taken at a lower dose and with fewer visits to the doctor\u2019s office. The change brings the drug\u2019s label into alignment with common medical practice in 47 states \u2014 and will make the drug more accessible to women in three states, where lawmakers had required doctors to prescribe the drug according to the original label.

        "In the 1980s and \u201990s, many doctors told women going through menopause that they should take female hormones \u2014 estrogen and progestin \u2014 to alleviate symptoms like hot flashes and sleep problems. The hormone therapy was thought to have other benefits, too, like preventing broken bones, colon cancer and heart attacks. But in 2002, a bombshell hit.",
        "Terrell Walker lives in a apartment in Southeast Washington, D. C. with her and daughters. Walker stopped paying her rent last September because, she says, her apartment is in horrible condition \u2014 and she is fighting her landlord\u2019s eviction threat in court. But when tenants don\u2019t pay, landlords say they have less money to fix things up.

Now, in the HBO drama Vinyl, Romano plays the head of promotions at a record company in financial trouble.",
        "HBO\u2019s music industry drama Vinyl comes at you like a classic rock song you can\u2019t get out of your head. Powerful. Emotional. But also kind of predictable. It\u2019s obvious from one of the earliest moments in the first episode, when Bobby Cannavale\u2019s record company owner Richie Finestra stumbles into a smoky club circa 1971 and finds the New York Dolls. Martin Scorsese does an amazing job the anarchic spirit of the time, with fans and sexually available groupies littering the steps up to the main stage.",
        "For nine seasons, Ray Romano played Ray Barone on the CBS hit sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond. The show, loosely based on Romano\u2019s real life, earned the comedian millions of dollars and numerous accolades, including three Emmys and four People\u2019s Choice Awards.

Freezing will begin \u201dshortly\u201d and will be carried out in phases, according to the Tokyo Electric Power Co. or TEPCO, which owns the plant.

Then in October, the band released its debut album, The Things We Do To Find People Who Feel Like Us, which has meant nonstop touring.

His job was to open the hatch on top and drop a rope inside to measure the level of oil. But just after midnight, a found him dead, slumped next to the open hatch. Even though an autopsy showed Bergsing had hydrocarbons in his blood \u2014 things like benzene and butane \u2014 the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u2019s investigation found no safety violations.
