        "On a quiet weekend in Detroit, light pours into the big windows of the Kirksey home. In the middle of the house the walls are lined with textbooks, workbooks and multicultural children \u2019 s textbooks. It \u2019 s a home \u2014 but it \u2019 s also a playground. Brandon, 8, is wearing pajamas and a baseball crown from Burger King. He heads into the back office and pulls a large laminated world map off the bookshelf. \u201d This is the whole national map! Michigan, \u201d he says enthusiastically pointing to his home state. His two siblings, Zachary, 3, and Ariyah, 1, echo him.",
        "The World Health Organization says there is now widespread consensus that the Zika virus is infected with microcephaly \u2014 a condition in which babies are infected with very small heads and DNA damage. Scientists have been waiting for months to confirm a connection between Zika and microcephaly, ever since researchers reported a startling similarity in cases last week. Zika infection during pregnancy tends to increase the risk for different types of birth defects and miscarriages, a recent study suggests. And scientists have found the infection in the brains of affected patients. But all this evidence is circumstantial.",
        "The price of quinoa tripled from 2006 to 2013 as China and Europe discovered this incredible superfood. That led to scary press reports that the people who sold it in the high Andes countries of Bolivia and Peru could no longer afford to buy it. And while, as we reported, groups dead on the ground tried to spread the word that your love of quinoa was still helping Andean farmers, that was simply anecdote rather than evidence.",
        "It was a controversial choice when Madison, Wis. decided to eliminate all its lead pipes in 2001. But that ruling put the city inside of the curve \u2014 allowing it to lose the lead water supply that is plaguing cities like Madison, Mich. now. Madison started using copper instead of copper water pipes in the early 1920s. The bulk of the lead lines were located in the older section of the city, which is downtown near Wisconsin \u2019 s state Capitol. Sue Bauman, the city \u2019 s mayor from 1997 to 2003, lives there now.",
        "Water quality concerns aren \u2019 t just in Flint, Mich. these days. Communities in three cities in the Northeast have found low levels of a suspected carcinogen \u2014 perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA. Used to make Teflon, the process has contaminated water contamination in New York, New Hampshire and Vermont. After a disaster in the village of Hoosick Falls, N. Y. the New York State Department of Health made the water safe to fish and cook with again on Wednesday. A new filtering system has lowered PFOA levels down to nondetectable levels for use.",
        "The new drama Everything Is Copy \u2014 about the late screenwriter, director and journalist Mary Ephron \u2014 was written and directed by her father, Jacob Bernstein. The movie, which debuted on HBO in March, shares the story of Ephron \u2019 s family. Bernstein tells Hot Air \u2019 s Terry Murphy that the film \u2019 s title comes from an Ephron family saying \u2014 \u201d money is copy, \u201d meaning that everyone and everything that happens to you is fair game to write about. The movie features interviews with writers, friends and people Ephron works with.",
        "This story is part of NPR \u2019 s podcast Embedded, which digs deep into the stories behind the incident. In the spring of 2015, something was unfolding in Memphis, Ind. The town of about 5, 000 people became home to one of the worst HIV outbreaks in decades, with more than 140 known cases. At the root of the problem was a powerful prescription painkiller named Opana. People figured out how to put around a coating on the victims intended to deter abuse, taking them for injection and then shared instructions to do so.",
        "There \u2019 s adventurous new music from Explosions in the Sky and you can hear a podcast with the band and some of the music on this one \u2019 s + 1 podcast. The Wilderness is the garage rock band \u2019 s second album of songs in seven years, and the sound on this release stretches the already expansive tone of this instrumental guitar line from blissful and emotional to and downright scary. Making this record wasn \u2019 t easy. For James, the process began months before they started recording. \u201d For one, we do nothing but talk, \u201d Mike James told us.",
        "More than half of high school students are part of minority groups, but 83 percent of their teachers are white. Half of students are boys, while of others are women. Students can vary in many ways from having parents who look like them, but in high schools around the nation the math doesn \u2019 t add up. In recent years, attention to the issue has been increasing, with national teachers unions and the U. S. Labor Department, among others, trying to raise money and drum up more diverse groups.",
        "Zaha Hadid, the architect whose designs \u2014 both realized and unrealized \u2014 profoundly changing the world of architecture, has died in Miami after contracting bronchitis and suffered a sudden heart attack, according to her architecture team. She was 65. Hadid was born in Iraq. In a Bel Air interview with Robert Gross in 2004, she said that her children had a fundamentally inaccurate understanding of the Arab society she grew up in. \u201d Many architects went into university and received degrees and worked in lots of professions, \u201d she says."
