        "One of the approaches to providing good service in nursing homes is simply having enough staff. The US government says about a quarter of all nursing home complaints can be traced back to low staffing levels. And studies have connected low staff salaries to lousy treatment. The state of New Mexico connects it to prisons. The state \u2019 s Attorney General is suing a chain of nursing facilities, alleging that the facilities were so small they couldn \u2019 t possibly have provided the treatment they charged for. Now New Mexico wants its money back. Lino Lucero is \u201d confidential witness # 1 \u201d in the court.",
        "Myanmar became a major milestone this month, as civilian leaders, including Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, replaced the generals who have been fighting the Southeast Asian states, directly or indirectly, for more than a half century. The outgoing President, U Thein Sein, formally relinquished his inauguration Wednesday to his successor, General Htin Kyaw. Thein Sein, an has guided the country from military dictatorship to a fledgling democracy over the past five years. He now wishes to head to a Buddhist Monastery to be ordained as a monk, according to media reports.",
        "Ever stopped on the coastline, gazing out over the mountains, and wondered what \u2019 s on the other side? Pondered where you \u2019 d wind up if you could fly straight ahead until you hit shore? Turns out the answer might be GPS. And even if you pulled out an atlas \u2014 or, more realistically, your smartphone \u2014 you still have trouble figuring it out. Loss of latitude won \u2019 t help, and missing a path on most maps will lead you astray.",
        "Last week, a record number of migrants and refugees \u2014 more than 1 million \u2014 entry into Europe, sparking a crisis as refugees struggle to cope with the migration of more and more people. And one part of the crisis is health crisis. Migrants often have trouble finding medical care in the countries in which they resettle. Those who are in the country illegally have an even harder time.",
        "Five women players from the U. S. women \u2019 s national soccer teams have filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging that the U. S. Soccer Federation pays the reigning Federation Cup champions significantly less than their male counterparts. \u201d I think that we \u2019 ve proven our worth over the years, \u201d Carli Lloyd, the 2015 ACC women \u2019 s player of the year, said in an interview on CBS \u2019 s Today show.",
        "LaToya Fowlkes is standing outside rent court in Boston. A judge has just ruled that Fowlkes has to pay her landlord $ 4, 900 in rent and costs despite her complaints that the house has leaky water pipes, chipped bricks, rodents and a huge hole in the living room wall. But Fowlkes didn \u2019 t notify her landlord of the problems by certified authority \u2014 something the judge thinks she should have done to avoid eviction. \u201d It \u2019 s good for tenants, because tenants don \u2019 t break the law.",
        "According to Donald Trump, he \u2019 s got an exceptional relationship with women. \u201d I like women. I love women. I cherish women! \u201d Trump speaks at political conference last year, but it \u2019 s a version of a theme he repeats often on the campaign trail. His poll results and recent comments, however, tell a slightly different story. Trump \u2019 s favorability stories with female voters are good enough that they could become a problem for him should he be the candidate in the presidential election.",
        "It \u2019 s no easy thing to simultaneously achieve thousands of streams on Spotify and chart at the University of Nashville radio stations, especially with just an EP to your face. You \u2019 ve likely heard Maren Williams \u2019 songs performed by other musicians on country radio, but when her own \u201d My Heart \u201d hit, she knew her transition from Nashville songwriter to professional artist was complete. In Austin, NPR \u2019 s Audie Cornish settled down with Morris, who was performing at the SXSW rock festival for the first time ( and who also played Mountain Music a lullaby down by a creek ).",
        "This week, several lawmakers approved a bill titled the \u201d Protecting Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination Bill. \u201d Supporters describe it as a bill protecting religious freedom. Critics call it a sweeping bill giving state sanction to stop discrimination against LGBT persons. The legislation, now sitting on the Governor \u2019 s desk, allows government employees to refuse to obtain licenses and protects drug companies and religious groups from being punished for denying a series of services to LGBT individuals. And it \u2019 s clearly focused on the freedom of LGBT people \u2014 not on religious freedom writ large.",
        "You know the often \u2014 troubled teen becomes inspirational mentor, and it hardly matters whether we \u2019 re talking a delinquent battling a judge, or a chess club pitted against a street gang. But clearly the mentor is more troubled than the teen. That \u2019 s the story in The Dark Tower, a tale about a Maori champion who is pulled from a New Zealand psychiatric institution, alas, into the home of his son. From frying pan to fire, with many issues.",
        "When Kevin Smith first started abusing Opana IV, a potent prescription opioid painkiller, he takes pills \u2014 or fractions of pills \u2014 and mixed them into a fine powder, then swallow it. When Opana pills are swallowed, they release their painkilling ingredient over 12 hours. If the pill were crushed and snorted, however, the drug was released in a reduced dose. \u201d Just think about it, \u201d Polly says, \u201d 12 hours of pain, and, \u2019 BAM! \u2019 you \u2019 re getting it all at once. \u201d But the drug \u2019 s developer, Endo Pharmaceuticals, reformulated Opana in 2012.",
        "Ane Brun recently reached 40, and she \u2014 like many of us who \u2019 ve reached that milestone \u2014 has been taking stock of her life. It \u2019 s a period filled with music and dance, but there have also been a few rough patches. Like the time we took her to play a Tiny Desk concert in 2012 and she was forced to cancel an earlier North American date ( with Peter Gabriel ) due to a lupus flareup. Brun, a Norwegian native living in Sweden, was diagnosed with the autoimmune condition when she was 27.",
        "For workers who wanted a raise, this was an encouraging event, with legislation gaining traction and employers paying more towards the board. In fact, the Railway Employees International Union called this \u201d a historic week. \u201d Here \u2019 s what happens on the wage front in two days : The Labor Party said Friday that last month, employers created 215, 000 jobs and raised average hourly earnings by seven cents, to $ 25. 43. That might not sound like much of a change, but compared with one year ago, wages are up 2. 3 percent.",
        "The hall of mirrors that is April Fools\u2019 Day is upon us, and that means all news emerging until midnight tonight is suspect. The pranks range from outright hoaxes to jokes \u2014 some of which have already gone very badly. Suspicions are high: Some are wondering why Taylor Swift would release a video promoting Apple Music, a service she pointedly criticized when it first went live, on this day of all days. And we can be forgiven for wondering whether astronomers really found \u201dthe first star with an almost pure oxygen atmosphere\u201d \u2014 a white dwarf that\u2019s puzzling scientists.",
        "During the 1930s, as Adolf Hitler was rising to power in Germany, the man who would turn out to be his most implacable foe was drowning \u2014 in debt and champagne. In 1936, Winston Churchill owed his wine merchant the equivalent of $75, 000 in today\u2019s money. He was also in hock to his watchmaker and printer \u2014 but his sybaritic lifestyle, of a country aristocrat, continued apace. Stories of Churchill\u2019s special relationship with alcohol are legendary.",
        "It was a rare moment on the campaign trail with the normally calm and collected Hillary Clinton: At a rally at a college campus in New York, Clinton can be seen on video chewing out a Greenpeace activist who challenged her over \u201dfossil fuel money in your campaign.\u201d It\u2019s hardly the first time Clinton has heard this, with its implication that dirty energy has got her on a string. Campaign finance data suggest it wouldn\u2019t be much of a string. Still, the video was enough for the campaign of her rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, to pounce on Clinton.",
        "Don Cheadle has been playing Miles Davis for his entire career. To look back now on some of the actor\u2019s most exciting performances \u2014 as flashy porn star Buck Swope in Boogie Nights, con man Basher Tarr in the Ocean\u2019s trilogy, and deejay Petey Greene in Talk to Me \u2014 is to recognize those same elements from the persona of the jazz legend and Cheadle\u2019s personal hero. Maybe all that was missing was that Jheri curl and that brilliantly weaponized trumpet. In his feature directorial debut, Cheadle finally lets us in on the Miles in his mind.",
        "Beautifully lit, perfectly styled food photography is everywhere \u2014 in magazines, food blogs, and even Instagram, where your cousin is already expert at using natural light to make mom\u2019s cooking look delicious. These images are usually carefully curated to project an image of an idealized existence where the chicken never burns and everyone is always smiling, perfectly coiffed round the table. Dimly Lit Meals for One, a new book based off a popular Tumblr, serves up quite the opposite scenario.",
        "Bernie Sanders and his supporters don\u2019t consider moving Hillary Clinton to the left a goal or even really a victory of any kind. They want to change America, not the stated positions of another candidate. And while he may not be beating her in the delegate race at the moment, there\u2019s an argument that Sanders has already won by getting the issues he cares about into the political blood stream.",
        "This is dating me, but I know this to be true: In the 1970s, black guys who wanted to be considered culturally serious always had some Miles to throw on the turntable. They might jam to Sly Stone, James Brown or Earth, Wind Fire at a party. They often sang Stevie Wonder at the top of their voices while in the shower. But on quiet evenings, it always went back to Miles. Maybe they were alone after a long day. Often there was a girl they wanted to impress.",
        "Baseball\u2019s opening day is upon us. Sunday is the first official day of Major League Baseball\u2019s 2016 season. Starting things off will be two afternoon games as the Cardinals face the Pirates and the Blue Jays take on the Rays. The day will be capped off by a night match between the 2015 World Series contenders the Kansas City Royals and New York Mets. \u201dOpening day is always a special time in baseball,\u201d says Jesse Sanchez, a national reporter for MLB. com.",
        "There\u2019s a new tool for battling the opioid epidemic, compressed inside long, metal tanks at an emergency room in Paterson, N. J. It\u2019s laughing gas, also known as nitrous oxide. If you think this is a joke, spend a few hours with Alexis LaPietra, medical director of pain management at St. Joseph\u2019s Regional Medical Center\u2019s emergency department. She\u2019s developed an program that\u2019s trying out unusual ways to help patients through their pain without using prescription painkillers in the ER, where the road to addiction began for many patients.",
        "The boys and girls at the party are matched up by height. They dance together. Maybe they do a little grinding. They talk about love . .. and marriage. Then they eat birthday cake. That doesn\u2019t sound like a radical event. But in a predominantly conservative Muslim slum in the Indian city of Kolkata it was unheard of. And what made it happen? Lush, romantic Bollywood movies. That\u2019s what Kabita Chakraborty learned after she began doing research in Kolkata.",
        "Critics call them \u201dparachute researchers\u201d: Scientists from wealthy nations who swoop in when a puzzling disease breaks out in a developing country. They collect specimens, then head straight back home to analyze them. They don\u2019t coordinate with people fighting the epidemic on the ground \u2014 don\u2019t even share their discoveries for months, if ever. Sometimes it\u2019s because they want to publish their results \u2014 and medical journals prefer exclusives. And sometimes it\u2019s because they can make a lot of money by coming up with copyrighted treatments for the disease.",
        "In a hot, dusty courtyard in Goma, a city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, about 50 teenage boys begin their daily practice of capoeira, a martial art. As they wave their arms and shuffle their feet, they giggle and whisper to each other in Swahili. When the teacher, whom the kids call Ninja, yells out a command in Portuguese, the language of capoeira, they dutifully follow. Capoeira is best known in Brazil, where slaves from Africa brought it centuries ago. Now the art is making its way back to the continent.",
        "A week after Syrian government forces seized the ancient city of Palmyra from the Islamic State, soldiers, engineers and archaeologists are tallying up the damage done to the ancient city. Visiting the site on Friday, journalists from The Associated Press said the modern town of Palmyra is \u201dcompletely deserted,\u201d and the nearby archaeological site full of treasured monuments reduced to rubble. The SANA news agency said a mass grave had been found in a Palmyra neighborhood, with the bodies of approximately 40 people, according to multiple media reports.",
        "Welcome to the April Fools\u2019 edition of the Dose \u2014 no pranks, just serious bizness. O. K. maybe not so serious \u2014 maybe Team Dose just takes it seriously, because we care. And even as one side of the spectrum is experiencing a bursting of a bubble \u2014 retirements, bankruptcies, key events attracting smaller crowds \u2014 another one continues reinventing itself and its norms.",
        "The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra celebrated its 100th birthday earlier this year. In a performance of Ravel\u2019s Bol\u00e9ro, the orchestra presented a few members of a new generation of players eager to take the music into a new century. They were members of the BSO\u2019s OrchKids program, onstage at Meyerhoff Symphony Hall to play right alongside regular orchestra musicians. Marin Alsop is a regular commentator on NPR she\u2019s also the music director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and a founding director of OrchKids. The program was launched in 2008 with just 30 children from backgrounds.",
        "Bernie Sanders\u2019 appearance on New York City\u2019s Hot 97 Ebro In The Morning started as just another stop on his campaign\u2019s push to win over the state\u2019s voters before its primary later this month. On the show Friday, Sanders gave his usual stump, talking about income inequality, his tax plan and affordable education to listeners of one of the city\u2019s leading stations. Given the show\u2019s audience, Sanders\u2019 appearance was a clear attempt to reach out to young people, and especially young people of color.",
        "What would you consider \u201dthe best selfie ever\u201d? A shot of yourself alongside the pope, the president, Angela Merkel, Lin Manuel Miranda or Steph Curry? This week Ben Innes, a health and safety auditor from Leeds, Great Britain, used those words to send out a photo in which he posed with the man who hijacked his plane. The hijacker has what looks like a suicide vest of explosives strapped to his chest. Ben Innes is grinning. \u201dI\u2019m not sure why I did it,\u201d Mr. Innes told The Sun."
