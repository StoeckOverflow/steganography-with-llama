        "Ronnie Spector was champion of the heart and soul of the 1960 \u2019 s, and she has since stopped. You might recognize her as the leader of The Ronettes, the girl band that gave us \u201d Be My Baby \u201d and \u201d Baby, I Love You. \u201d She also helped turn rock \u2019 n \u2019 roll into a popular force. Her new project, English Heart, is representative of hits from British artists from the 1960s. It includes a take on \u201d Don \u2019 t Let Me Be Misunderstood, \u201d a hit for The Animals in 1965 \u2014 and a ballad to which Spector says she feels a special connection.",
        "Scott Walker never got the chance to officially face off with Donald Trump at the ballot box \u2014 but if the GOP loses on the Wisconsin Party \u2019 s home turf, it potentially could be a victory of sorts for the former presidential candidate. In fact, should Trump win, it could be in part because of one very big miscalculation : Walker becomes very popular among many Republicans, but the real race mogul continues to attack him. The well respected Marquette High School Poll this night put the governor \u2019 s approval rating at 80 percent among likely primary margins.",
        "Associates of President Vladimir Putin of Russia have channeled as much as $ 2 billion through government accounts, banks and foreign companies, according to a secret leak of documents from a Panamanian accounting firm. More than 11 million emails, dubbed the Panama Papers, show how dozens of important and powerful people across the world have used fraud and secret accounts to dodge taxes and sanctions and launder money.

        "The city of Reggio Calabria in Southern Italy is home of one of the most powerful criminal syndicates in the country. \u2019 Ndrangheta, as it \u2019 s known, is a brutal institution funded largely by drug trafficking and it \u2019 s been tied to corrupt local officials. For the last four years, Mayor Roberto Di Giorgio has taken a new position to try to deplete the ranks of the police. Judge Di Matteo presides over juvenile court and he \u2019 s is attempting to prevent the children of \u2019 Ngrangehta people from joining the family ranks.",
        "Like so many Americans approaching power, Virginia Republican Rep. Scott Rigell dreams about spending a little more time on the water. \u201d I have a little rowboat called Big Nelly. She \u2019 s 13 feet long, and there \u2019 s not a boat on it. There \u2019 s no radio on it. And I \u2019 m so looking forward to being on that rowboat, \u201d says Rigell. Rigell is retiring after just four years in Congress. He was one of the 87 Republicans who rode the Tea Party wave to a recent GOP takeover of the House.",
        "Class has just begun at a community center in the eastern Swedish town of Ronneby. This is the main stop for refugees in the region, once they \u2019 ve been granted asylum. They give 60 hours of instruction on how to work in Sweden. The courses teach such things as how to rent an apartment, get a job and become old here. \u201d It \u2019 s basically how to stay and survive in Sweden, \u201d says Henrik Lovgren, who runs the course. \u201d Rules, culture, people.",
        "If you \u2019 ve been following any of the local news stories on drug fraud lately, you \u2019 ll realize that it \u2019 s tough to know what exactly is in our food \u2014 and where it \u2019 s been before it makes it onto our dinner plates. Earlier this year, was sued for stocking tubs of Parmesan coffee that contained filler.",
        "As much as we might like to, we can \u2019 t lay claim to that headline. Credit Rik Stevens, instead, with the golden duck rhyme, which he tweeted to All Things Considered Magazine this week. It was an early precursor to what is already becoming a successful National Poetry Contest. The annual event, which runs on April each year, luxuriates in the spring, celebrating poetry in all its forms, sources and sizes. And we at least couldn \u2019 t help but toss our winners into the ring.",
        "Friday carried a pretty strong past jobs report. Labor force participation ( that is, the proportion of Americans working or applying for work ) picked up, and wages were solid \u2014 two things that haven \u2019 t always been confidence inspiring in past jobs reported. Jobseekers weren \u2019 t the only ones celebrating this report the Obama administration got the opportunity to brag, as well, tweeting about the short, uninterrupted stretch of job discrimination. They \u2019 ve been touting this streak for a long time now. So what \u2019 s behind the claim? We want to dig. The Claim ( and Chart ) : The headline : Is that true?",
        "For months, the two leading Republican leaders have tried to prove they \u2019 re tough on Muslims. Donald Trump famously introduced the policy of a temporary ban on illegal immigration, and then, last month, the said he believes \u201d God hates us. \u201d US Sen. Ted Cruz has often insisted President Obama should use the term \u201d radical Islamic communities \u201d and, last week, Obama issued a statement that calls for patrolling Muslim neighborhoods. This political rhetoric is horrifying many Muslims, but it \u2019 s also had unintended personal effects \u2014 encouraging them to go out to vote and work with other religious communities.",
        "Baseball in the U. S. has become an international sport. This season about a quarter of the players on Major League Baseball teams were born outside the United States. The nation with the biggest number is the Dominican Republic, which had 83 players on opening day rosters last year. The success of Dominican major leaguers has been a boon for the Caribbean nation \u2019 s prospects. But there \u2019 s also been controversy over the availability of young prospects who failed to make the cut. The sport has long been popular in the Dominican Republic.",

The files were leaked to the Austrian paper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, which shared the information trove with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalism.

        "In Chicago, one neighborhood\u2019s rat problem is about to get a lot worse. Crews are preparing to tear down an old hospital and when the wrecking ball starts swinging, the rodents living in and underneath the aging structure will scurry.

        "Saying they found \u201da darker link between religion and the evolution of modern hierarchical societies\u201d than has been previously suggested, a group of scientists say ritual human sacrifice promoted stratified social systems \u2014 and helped to sustain inherited class systems once they were established. After comparing dozens of societies, the researchers found that ritualized human sacrifice was far more common in highly stratified societies than it was in egalitarian societies.",
        "Ted Cruz and Donald Trump don\u2019t agree on much lately, but the two GOP presidential candidates are in accord on one thing \u2014 it\u2019s time for Ohio Gov. John Kasich to get out of the race. NBC News was the first to report a between the two men, who are typically at odds.

S. women\u2019s soccer team, Ronda Rousey, Holly Holm and Miesha Tate in the UFC and tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams as proof of the growing clout of women\u2019s sports, McMahon called for changing the \u201dDivas\u201d (women\u2019s) division of pro wrestling.

Ben Hopkins (in red, fingernails included) and Liv Bruce swap roles as singers, guitarists, drummers and storytellers, each trying to playfully the other.",
        "Editor\u2019s note: The following interview contains descriptions that some may find disturbing. Forget \u201denhanced interrogation techniques\u201d \u2014 Eric Fair says what he did as an interrogator in Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq was torture. \u201dThe idea that there\u2019s interrogation, and then enhanced interrogation, and then torture \u2014 there is no middle ground,\u201d he tells Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross. \u201dTorture is an enhanced interrogation.\u201d The techniques Fair used were considered legal by the U. S. government, but what he did still weighs on his conscience.",
        "Last week, Germany announced that it will introduce train cars for women and children only to provide a secure space for female passengers. That\u2019s an idea that other countries have tried. And it\u2019s not always a popular plan. An essay in Quartz published in 2014 argued that the women\u2019s car confines women to the \u201dperiphery of public spaces\u201d and reinforces gender roles. I\u2019m a regular passenger in a women\u2019s car. And I disagree. The Delhi metro rail is by far my favorite mode of transportation in the city, thanks in part to the ladies\u2019 car.",
        "When Architect Matthias Hollwich was approaching 40, he wondered what the next 40 years of his life might look like. He looked into the architecture that serves older adults, places like retirement communities and assisted living facilities, and didn\u2019t like what he saw. But what if we changed our habits earlier in life so we could stay in the communities we already live in? \u201dRetirement communities sounded great when they were created, but now when you retire, you may live there for 30 or even 40 years,\u201d he says.",
        "The U. S. Constitution says that \u201dWe the People\u201d are the source of political authority in America. But just who are \u201dthe people\u201d? That\u2019s a big and basic political question, and today the Supreme Court gave its answer \u2014 in a unanimous decision. The court ruled that the total population as defined by the Census Bureau should be used when counting people for political purposes. That means all persons residing in a particular state or district are to be counted, not just those who are eligible to vote.",
        "HBO\u2019s Vinyl offers plenty of incentive for pleasurable hate watching, from its macho take on gender relations to its murder subplot. For music mavens, the glee and groans are prompted by the show\u2019s haphazard treatment of the history of rock and roll \u2014 and hip hop and disco and Donny Osmond. The fake cameos from the likes of Alice Cooper and Gram Parsons are one source of fun then there are the show\u2019s amalgamated \u201doriginal\u201d characters, whose trajectories can be granted more license (they never happened, after all) but can still get remotes thrown at TV sets.",
        "Recently, we started a conversation about food and race. Specifically, we wondered out loud, who gets to cook \u2014 and become the face of \u2014 a culture\u2019s cuisine? Our question was prompted by a recent Sporkful interview with Rick Bayless, who has faced criticism over his long career. Although he is an Oklahoman with no Mexican ancestry, he has become one of the most prominent ambassadors for Mexican cuisine in America. To be clear, this isn\u2019t about Bayless.",
        "Tomorrow, Wisconsin\u2019s primary is poised to do something it has not done in more than 30 years. It is about to deal a blow to a presidential . Still more amazing is the fact the state\u2019s primary voters are expected to throw some shade on both the Democratic and Republican an unimaginable result in the long era since World War II. For six decades, Wisconsin has been anything but the field of dreams for long shots and outsiders. Wisconsinites have voted roughly halfway through the primary calendar, and they have almost always endorsed the candidates who were already winning.",
        "For a brief span Sunday, the \u201dC\u201d in CHP stood for Chihuahua. That\u2019s because a black dog led what police describe as a pursuit over the Bay Bridge between San Francisco and Oakland, before being placed in official custody. The dog\u2019s only identifying tag \u2014 black, with a silver human skull \u2014 served to cement his status as a hardcore animal who\u2019s not wowed by authority. His flight from the law was captured on a dashboard camera and posted to social media in what quickly became a video.",
        "The Department of Housing and Urban Development is making it easier for people with criminal records to find housing. In new guidance, released Monday, HUD tells landlords and home sellers that turning down tenants or buyers based on their criminal records may violate the Fair Housing Act. People with criminal records aren\u2019t a protected class under the Fair Housing Act, and the guidance from HUD\u2019s general counsel says that in some cases, turning down an individual tenant because of his or her record can be legally justified.",
        "Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders won the Wisconsin primaries Tuesday night, an important step for both candidates as they look to stop their leading rivals and close their delegate gaps. For the Republican Texas senator, he\u2019s on pace for a nearly win over Donald Trump, increasing the likelihood of a contested Republican convention this July in Cleveland. \u201dTonight is a turning point. It is a rallying cry,\u201d Cruz told supporters at his victory party in Milwaukee. \u201dIt is a call from the hardworking men and women of Wisconsin to the people of America. We have a choice.",
        "More than 700 million women worldwide today were married as children, and most of them are in developing countries. But there is a growing recognition that many young teens are marrying in the United States as well \u2014 and several states are now taking action to stop it. Advocates say the young marriages run the gamut: They include teens of every ethnicity and religion, teens who are and teens who are not being forced into arranged marriages."
