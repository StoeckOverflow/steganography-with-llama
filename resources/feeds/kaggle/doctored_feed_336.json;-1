        "Even as the death penalty grows out of power in the United States, the number of executions worldwide has returned to its highest level in 25 years, a new report on the death penalty from Amnesty International finds. The human rights group recorded 1, 634 executions in 2015, a number rivaled only by a period started in 1988. James Clark, Iran \u2019 s senior death penalty campaigner, says the numbers can seem a bit misleading because the process was driven mostly by Arab countries \u2014 Iran, Sudan and Saudi Arabia, which account for 89 percent of all executions.",
        "Live food begins at 8 p. m. Western Time. As our food policy has rapidly evolved over the last few decades, issues regarding where our food comes from and what it needs have become mainstream, albeit politicized, debates. However, when considering something like natural versus genetically engineered food, which communities are involved in the dialogue and who benefits when decisions are made? Can producers and consumers work together to make sure high end food is accessible to consumers?",
        "Ever read The Beverly Hillbillies and wonder why Joe Clampett moved to Beverly Hills and not Texas or some town that we more likely associate with oil? Even Angelenos forget sometimes that the Clampetts came first, then the swimming pool and movie stars. Especially J. Paul Getty or Thomas Doheny, men who made their fortune on oil and then made money. Los Angeles is a thriving center for transportation, manufacturing, manufacturing and \u2014 above all \u2014 entertainment. In the middle of this metropolis, oil is hidden in plain sight.",
        "For Erin Moore, keeping her son \u2019 s cystic fibrosis in place requires careful monitoring to prevent the thick, dark mucous his body produces from further penetrating his lungs and digestive system. Moore keeps tabs on Drew \u2019 s nutrition, appetite, exercise and stools every day to see if they originate from his healthy baseline. When he develops a tumor, she tracks that, too. It has been nearly a decade since Drew has been hospitalized as a child he was admitted up to four times annually.",

The outside of the house is painted buttercream yellow, contrasting with red and tan. Additionally, there \u2019 s an artistic stone inlay on the wall of the living room, a giant nightingale mural on one side, and ornate wooden carvings. They create a world long removed from much of the world that remains just outside.",
        "In the 1940s, an elite team of mathematicians and scientists started work on a project that would send the U. S. into space, then on to the Moon and Mars. They would later become NASA \u2019 s Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( or JPL ) but here \u2019 s what made them so influential : Many of the people who followed the course to space missions were women. Nathalia Holt relates their story in her new book, Rise of the Rocket System : The Women Who Propelled Us, from Missiles to the Road to Mars.",
        "Mississippi Gov. Tom Bryant has signed a law \u201d religious freedom \u201d laws into law. The legislation, HB 1523, says that the state government will not support people who refuse to offer services to people because of a legal opposition to marriage, extramarital affairs or transgender people. Supporters believe it protects the rights of women who are opposed to homosexuality but who now live in a country where marriage is a natural right. Opponents say the legislation amounts to a state sanction for racial discrimination.",
        "Americans take away about a third of our imported food. But what some see as cheap, others are seeing as a better opportunity. A new company known as the Heartland Biogas Project is removing wasted food from Canada \u2019 s most populous areas and converts it into electricity. Through a technology known as anaerobic digestion, spoiled milk, old pet food and vats of grease combined with helpful bacteria in large tanks to generate power. I went to check out the lab.",
        "\u201d [ T ] here was no difference between people, in intelligence or race, so much as the difference between the sick and the hungry. \u201d That fairly familiar thought, a mere fleeting perception from The Great Gatsby, is the bedrock wisdom of Charles Bock \u2019 s new and harrowing new novel, Alice Oliver. Alice is a young mother in her 20s who, one morning, out of the blue, coughs up bloody phlegm, collapses and is diagnosed with leukemia. Oliver is her husband.",
        "Editor \u2019 s note : This is an excerpt from the book The Informed Parent : A Resource for Your Daughter \u2019 s First Four Children. If you haven \u2019 t experienced it, no simple novel will capture the feeling of profound, dizzying fatigue that can accompany the next few weeks with a newborn. By the time child, Emily was working for an infant boarding house that could keep her company for those first few weeks of one night waking and holding him in a semiregulated state at about eight thirty. Well, not really, but the idea might have crossed her admittedly addled mind at 3 a.",
        "Renewable energy including solar and wind is booming around the country as the costs of energy have come down. But the sun doesn \u2019 t actually shine, and the wind doesn \u2019 t change when we need it to. This challenge has inspired a technology race to create energy \u2014 one that goes beyond your typical goal. Heat Storage : Molten Salt And A New Solar Farm, Batteries are often used to store solar power, but it can be a costly endeavor.",
        "An old country inn in the southern Swedish town of Karlshamn now shelters refugee families. Children play in the lobby, while a few adults watch news on a TV. More than 100 volunteers from the community want to help the refugees. But the newcomers\u2019 arrival also has brought out ugly sentiments on social media, says Magnus Arvidsson, who is coordinating the volunteers. He says some people were saying on Facebook, \u201dOh my God, there [are] a lot of refugees coming to our village and we have to lock our bikes. And hide our stuff.",
        "His career spanned the famous Bakersfield sound, the outlaw era, and 38 No. 1 hits on the country music charts. Now comes word that Merle Haggard has died Wednesday \u2014 his 79th birthday. Haggard gave voice to people living lives, and it was a voice he came by honestly.

The country musician died Wednesday morning in California. It was his 79th birthday. Haggard\u2019s music was drawn from a life that started in 1937 in a converted train boxcar, the family home in Bakersfield, Calif.

        "After he won a National Book Award, and one of the MacArthur Foundation\u2019s genius grants, no one anticipated Coates\u2019 next move. \u201dWhat\u2019s the good of getting a MacArthur genius grant if you can\u2019t go and write a comic book for Marvel?\u201d Coates tells NPR\u2019s Audie Cornish. \u201dI don\u2019t know.

        "Two laws were passed this week, on opposite sides of the U. S. In New York, the state became the fourth in the country to offer some form of paid parental leave to residents. When fully implemented, the state\u2019s program will compensate parents for up to 12 weeks of leave \u2014 twice what\u2019s currently covered in the most generous states. And in San Francisco, city supervisors voted to require employers to give workers six weeks of paid parental leave \u2014 not just partially paid, but fully paid. It\u2019s the first U.

        "Lance Mercier knows his job gets harder when a goes out on leave. But he recently also learned that raising a newborn involves, as he puts it, an \u201dinsurmountable\u201d amount of work. The bank manager from Silver Spring, Md. is currently on leave from work taking care of his newborn son with his wife, Luz. \u201dAs a manager who has had a lot of people go out on leave of absence, it absolutely sucks when they go out on leave,\u201d he said.",
        "Residents of Flint, Mich. may tell you lead is a serious menace, but for most of the last 5, 000 years, people saw lead as a miracle metal at the forefront of technology. \u201dYou can think about lead as kind of the plastic of the ancient world,\u201d says Joseph Heppert, a professor of chemistry at the University of Kansas. He says it was because lead is easy to melt \u2014 a campfire alone can do it. Unlike iron, lead is malleable.",
        "Every day at 2 p. m. Antonio Davila rolls the metal shutters down over the front of his computer repair shop in central Madrid.

Another black hole is currently listed in the Guinness World Records as the heaviest, because it may be as much as 21 billion solar masses.",
        "Brazil has been in the news a lot these days, but not for happy reasons. As it prepares to host the Olympics this August, the economy is tanking, the president is heading toward impeachment and the country has become ground zero for the Zika virus. All this is enough to make one recall Charles de Gaulle\u2019s famously dismissive remark, \u201dBrazil is not a serious country.\u201d He was, of course, wrong. Brazil is one of the world\u2019s greatest and most exciting cultures, one in which the drama of modernity plays out every single day.",

        "Donald Trump lost Wisconsin on Tuesday night by double digits (48 percent for Cruz, compared to 35 percent for Trump). By most accounts, it was a bad night for the who leads the current race for the GOP nomination. But by another measure \u2014 demographics \u2014 maybe it wasn\u2019t that surprising. Nate Cohn at The New York Times\u2019 Upshot makes the case that he never expected Trump to get more than 35 percent of the vote, and Trump performed exactly on the mark.",
        "Top officials with the Obama administration said Wednesday that they\u2019ll redirect $589 million toward the Zika virus response. Most of that money was to be used to deal with Ebola virus.

        "I looked at the sun with longing this morning, wondering when its rays would warm up the air. Monday, we had a snowstorm around Hanover, NH, of the kind that must have inspired T. S. Elliot\u2019s famous opening words from The Waste Land, \u201dApril is the cruelest month. ..\u201d Of course, the sun is doing its thing and it\u2019s really the weather patterns that are a bit wacky. But this is not about global warming or El Ni\u00f1o. It\u2019s about what happens when the sun doesn\u2019t do its thing as we hope it does.",
