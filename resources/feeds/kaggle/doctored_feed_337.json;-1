        "The revelations in the Panama Papers have generated anger and controversy. Politicians and leaders in countries from Germany to Iceland to the Gulf countries are implicated. The irony is that while the shady world of shell corporations and offshore accounts is still huge \u2014 costing governments thousands of billions of dollars a year \u2014 the international community has made large strides toward reining it in.

        "For the first time since 1984, the Wisconsin state primary has dealt a blow to the aspirations of a national. And just for small measure, this time the Badger party did it to the national in both major states. As a consequence, we can now expect both the Republican and Democratic nomination rounds to continue through the final primaries. And, in the GOP at heart, the issue seems destined to remain unresolved until the national elections in Cleveland in July.",
        "It must have seemed a straightforward way to address a U. S. Supreme Court justice who was famous for, amongst other things, prizing straightforwardness. But then people began to titter about the unintended acronym of the Antonin Scalia School of Business \u2014 and now George Mason University has tweaked the name. The new name for the institution in Arlington, Va. will be the Antonin Scalia Law School, says Law school dean James N. Butler, citing \u201d some acronym controversy on social media \u201d as the reason for the merger.",

S. drugmaker Pfizer and Irish competitor Allergan were scheduled to combine into the largest pharmaceutical giant in the world. But the merger worth at least $ 150 million has been terminated because of a recent change in U. S. tax returns. NPR \u2019 s Jim Zarroli reported the policy shift on the agenda yesterday : \u201d The Treasury Committee on Monday introduced laws aimed at reducing the opportunity for companies to carry out inversions.

        "\u201d Ya amar, Ya amar. \u201d When I was a teenager, I used to remember hearing those words \u2014 which meant something like \u201d young, gorgeous \u201d in Arabic \u2014 spoken and whispered at me by men on the beach in Cairo, where I spent my youth. I never got that sort of attention in suburban southern California, where I grew up. But at the Genena Hotel in Medinat Nasr on the outskirts of the city, clad in jeans and a shirt, I felt like the most beautiful girl in the world. That feeling didn \u2019 t last long.",

        "Most food, if we put it back far back, began as a seed. And the practice of supplying those seeds to companies has been transformed over the past. Farmers have given way to growth giants. A new phase of industry consolidation is now beginning. mergers are in progress, or under discussion, that would put more than half of American seed sales in the hands of three companies. If there \u2019 s anybody who can trace the course of this industry, and explain what drove it, it \u2019 s Jack Robinson. For most of his life, Robinson ran the family business : the J.",

        "Twenty years ago this week, in 1994, President Clinton signed a new bill. It was, in effect, a law in various ways to combat crime. The measure promised to put more cops on the scene, trained police and investigators to investigate domestic violence, imposed tougher prison sentences and provided money for new prisons. Clinton described his motivation to pass the 1994 Violent Crime Control Act in broad terms. \u201d Gangs and drugs have taken over our streets and undermined our schools, \u201d he said.",

The tall canopy tree dominates the island\u2019s forests, especially on the Big Island. \u2019\u014chi\u2019a makes up approximately 80 percent of Hawaii\u2019s native forests and more than half of \u2019\u014dhi\u2019a grows on Hawaii Island. Often the first plant to grow from a fresh lava flow, \u2019\u014chi\u2019a is known for its resilience. That\u2019s what makes a recent discovery all the more tragic: \u2019\u014dhi\u2019a is dying.

D. program at Columbia University, the 15 to 20 hours a week he spends teaching university undergraduates should mean he\u2019s an employee. He teaches in addition to conducting his own research.",
        "It has been a turbulent week for Mexico\u2019s diplomats in the U. S. The reason for the shakeup can be summed up in two words: Donald Trump. This week, the Republican presidential released details of one of his campaign promises \u2014 to make Mexico pay for construction of a border wall. The plan, which involves blocking billions of dollars that Mexicans working in the U. S. send back home, seemed to shake up Mexico\u2019s top officials and cause a break in their months of relative silence about Trump\u2019s comments.",
        "The Trump campaign will open a Washington, D. C. office next week, part of a larger move the campaign is making toward becoming a more traditional political operation.

C. office, it is \u201dconsolidating the functions related to the nomination process,\u201d which convention manager Paul Manafort will oversee.

        "Renewable energy and new technologies that are making power more reliable are growing rapidly in the U. S. Renewables are so cheap in some parts of the country that they\u2019re undercutting the price of older sources of electricity such as nuclear power. The impact has been significant on the nuclear industry, and a growing number of unprofitable reactors are shutting down. When the first nuclear power plants went online 60 years ago, nuclear energy seemed like the next big thing. In many ways, it lived up to that promise.",

But David Fleischer, the director of the Leadership LAB of the Los Angeles LGBT Center, thinks he\u2019s found a way to begin changing people\u2019s prejudices with just a short conversation. He and several collaborators struggled for years to get to this point. \u201dWe brainstormed every idea and tried every idea, overwhelmingly those ideas failed,\u201d he says.",
        "A new era for living in space may be about to start. A prototype habitat is headed to the International Space Station for a trial. What makes the module unique is it\u2019s launched folded up, and it\u2019s inflated to its full size once in orbit. The idea for inflatables began at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in the 1990s. The space agency was trying to figure out how to get astronauts to Mars, without the crew going crazy living in a tiny capsule for months on end. Kriss Kennedy was a NASA space architect working on the problem.",

        "Oh, American Idol. You were too good for this world. OK, maybe not too good. Maybe too rooted in people voting via telephone calls. When the show, which concludes its run Thursday night, started in June 2002, the first publicly available iPhone was almost five years away. Imagine starting a show today where you asked people interested in pop music to use a phone to dial a number. You might as well ask them to vote by waving a fountain pen at a dodo.",
        "I first met Tess Johnston in the late 1990s in a yellow, stucco apartment building where she lived in Shanghai\u2019s former French Concession. As was her habit, she dropped the key from her window and I let myself in. Her drafty apartment was crammed with books and street maps. Over tea, Johnston, then in her late 60s, regaled me with her latest adventures, rushing through the city\u2019s back alleys to photograph old villas before they succumbed to sledge hammers."
