        "He asked for $ 7 thousand to fight Zika. He got a few hundred thousand dollars. That \u2019 s the truth that Jailson Correia tells. He \u2019 s the health doctor for Recife, the city with the most cases of DNA damage in infants compared to Zika. The virus began spreading through Brazil last fall. In November, concerned about the cause of the outbreak, he asked the Brazilian government for help. What they received was a drop in the bucket. Why so stingy? Because Zika isn \u2019 t the only plague in Brazil. Two other species are spiking : dengue and chikungunya.",
        "A atheist law professor has been killed in Bangladesh. The article follows a string of incidents last year targeting outspoken advocates of secularism.

        "Philadelphia \u2019 s city mayor wants to do something few American cities have seen : pass a tax on sugar and other sugary drinks. So far, Reno, Calif. has been the only U. S. city to pass such a tax. That measure was targeted at reducing soda consumption ( and the negative health consequences that go along with eating too much of it ). But in Philly, the tax isn \u2019 t being viewed as a scheme to bring down the state \u2019 s high rates of obesity or cancer.",
        "On Friday, Pope Francis released a sermon called \u201d Amoris Laetitia, \u201d or \u201d The Joy of Peace. \u201d In it, he calls for the Catholic church to approach issues of faith, marriage, family planning and divorce with less emphasis on dogmatic law and more emphasis on social conscience.

        "Bill Clinton on Friday stopped short of saying he was sorry for a possible clash with Black Lives Matter protesters. However, the former president refused to make the squabble into a teachable moment. \u201d I did say yesterday in Philadelphia I would want to apologize for, but I hate to use it as an example of the injustice threatening our country, \u201d he addressed the crowd at a Hillary Clinton campaign event in Philadelphia, Pa.

Turns out, there \u2019 s a reason for those different titles. A physical failure in Demolition, which takes the demolishing of a marriage contract. Davis ( Jake Gyllenhaal ) is a wealthy financial exec who seems a bit distracted when we meet him.

        "Virtual reality enthusiasts are drawing ire when they learn about actual reality. On public transit, in cafes and on sidewalks people without VR headsets are getting judged, especially. With Facebook \u2019 s Oculus Rift and HTC Vive available for iOS and Sony PlayStation VR consoles in the fall, virtual reality is finding its way into the lives of tech enthusiasts with a little cash to spare. Think about it this way : Wearing a VR headset is like putting a paper bag over your shoulder. A really exciting, immersive, virtual paper bag. So it \u2019 s uncouth, stupid and possibly dangerous.",
        "To celebrate the start of the new baseball season, I offer you the poem The Pitcher, by Robert Francis ( ). The Pitcher, His art is eccentricity, his aim, How not to hit the mark he seems to aim at, His passion how to avoid the obvious, His technique how to vary the avoidance. The others throw to be comprehended. He, Throws to be a moment misunderstood. Yet not too much. Not errant, arrant, wild, But every seeming aberration willed. Not to, yet still, still to communicate, Making the batter understand too late.",

        "I hadn\u2019t been in Japan more than a few weeks before I was hooked on Japanese kar\u0113 raisu, or curry rice. It was the rich, unmistakable smell that seeped under doorways and filled the undercover shopping markets of Osaka that first caught my attention. I followed the scent down an alley and into a tiny eatery not large enough for more than a customers. Behind the wooden counter perched two large vats \u2014 the source of the seductive aromas.

        "If navigating your tax return has remained on the back burner until now, you can stretch the process out for three more days this year. That\u2019s right: This year\u2019s deadline is actually April 18. This is all because of a fortuitous overlap of federal and state holidays with the usual April 15 due date.

        "After a long, desolate winter devoid of bats and balls and more than a few questionable called strikes, baseball is finally once more upon us. And while the action on the diamond is the main attraction, it\u2019s by no means the only competition that rages in ballparks across the country.

        "The very mention of the Silk Roads creates an instant image: camel caravans trudging through the high plains and deserts of central Asia, carrying silks, spices and philosophies to Europe and the larger Mediterranean.
