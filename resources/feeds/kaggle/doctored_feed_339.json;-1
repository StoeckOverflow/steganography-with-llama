        "Maria Theresa is a widow, grandmother of eight and a legal permanent residence who has lived and worked in Sonoma County, Calif. for more than 40 years. But she has also come close to being deported. Thirty years ago, Sanchez was almost separated from her husband here in the U. S. for a crime she committed in the late 1990s. Hers is a story that sets up one of the most volatile problems in this election season \u2014 arrest, and by extension, deportation. President Obama has said he needs to prioritize the deportation of immigrants with poor records.",
        "To Bernie Mac supporters, the idea that certain superdelegates \u2014 elected officials and other electoral elites who can vote however they want at the convention \u2014 could change the nomination to Hillary Clinton seems terribly undemocratic. And so, they \u2019 re going to convince superdelegates, officially known as unpledged party leaders and public officials, to change their positions. There are several online petitions. One calls for the elimination of superdelegates first. Another asks superdelegates to align their signatures with regular voters, not party elites, and it has more than 200, 000 signatures.",
        "If there \u2019 s anything I \u2019 ve heard over the past few days, it \u2019 s that street harassment takes strange forms and happens quickly. And it makes women sound super icky \u2014 not flattered. After I shared my own experiences being catcalled by men when I spent years in Egypt as a teenager \u2014 and later being ambushed by a group of local boys just for wearing shirts \u2014 I wanted to know : How do women and boys treat girls in public in other parts of the country? Across NPR \u2019 s social media platforms, nobody told us their questions.",
        "Some accidents have negative consequences. And sometimes it \u2019 s the stuff you didn \u2019 t do \u2014 didn \u2019 t say, didn \u2019 t see \u2014 that left you with the most guilt. For 25 years, retired Army Col. William Taylor has carried feelings of guilt over the death of one of the soldiers in a maneuver he was investigating. In 1991, during one of the final stages of the Gulf War, Navy Spc. Andy Alaniz was killed by heavy fire in Iraq. A U. S. tank unit fired rounds at the group of tanks Alaniz was in, mistaking them for the enemy.",
        "The things they do for free. Politicians will eat almost any thing, adopt any colloquialism, endure any moment of awkward \u2014 just to seem \u201d happy. \u201d The latest example? Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, riding the New York subway through the streets, saying hi to everybody and taking selfies along the way. Depending on your point of view, the event \u2014 and it was an event \u2014 could be viewed as either a direct testament to Clinton \u2019 s New Deal bona fides, or just the latest example of how out of things she is. Here \u2019 s how it all happened.",
        "In an emergency, doctors, by law, must leave any patient in the U. S. until he or she is stabilized, regardless of the patient \u2019 s immigration status or ability to pay. Still, when it comes time for the state to discharge these patients, the same principle doesn \u2019 t apply. Though doctors are legally obligated to find legal places to discharge patients ( for example, to their homes, surgical facilities or nursing homes ) their insurance status makes all the difference. Several months ago I began working for a man who \u2019 d been in our hospital for more than seven months.",
        "Millions of Americans recharge their cars, screens and laptops before they go to bed at night, but do they recharge themselves? Arianna Huffington, and editor in chief of The Huffington Post, says we are in the middle of a crisis that creates stress, as well as exhaustion, confusion, a higher risk of fatal vehicle accidents \u2014 and increased stupidity. NPR \u2019 s Scott Miller talked with her about her new book, The Sleep Revolution : Transforming Your Nightmare, One Night at a Time. You had a kind of call on this topic, didn \u2019 t you? Yes, actually five years ago, April 2007.",
        "Last week, I found myself sitting across from my dad in a nice cafe in Georgetown, when he popped the news. \u201d Have you ever thought about law school? \u201d he asked. He \u2019 s still curious about my plans for when I started college. \u201d I think you \u2019 d make a great lawyer. And then you \u2019 d be able to make some money. \u201d This wasn \u2019 t the third ( or last ) time I \u2019 d been forced to drop journalism to make a career in something more important. My dad \u2019 s comment, I \u2019 m sorry, came from a place of both hope and fear.",
        "Residents in Altamonte Springs, just outside of Orlando, have a full public transportation provider \u2014 Uber. The city will be the first in the region to partially subsidize Uber fares. The city will pay 20 percent of any ride starting or ending in Altamonte Springs \u2014 25 percent for rides to or from the local commuter rail station. An original plan to build an alternate system fell through. The Uber partnership started March 21. Orlando \u2019 s Scott Simon wrote to City Manager Chris Martz about the new partnership. How is it possible? It \u2019 s working so far ahead.",
        "Seanan McGuire \u2019 s books and short stories have been outside the parameters of genre novels for years now, but always with a greater love of horror and romance. That hasn \u2019 t changed in her new publication, Every Heart a Doorway. Instead, she \u2019 s doubled down \u2014 and in half the thousands of pages. Tight and tautly told, Every Heart grabs one of speculative fiction \u2019 s most enduring tropes \u2014 the dark fantasy, where a person journeys from the real world into a different realm somewhere beyond \u2014 and wrings it for all the poignancy, dark humor, and excitement it can get.",
        "Some songwriters are quick to write songs about those people in life too painful to write about. When I met Merle Haggard aboard his tour bus in the early part of 2001, he no longer looked anything like the outlaw of his 20s, but a man who had been overwhelmed by the ups and downs of riches and bankruptcy, death, loss and time. He had run a long distance since his boyhood in a converted boxcar on the wrong side of the tracks, growing up just outside of Bakersfield, Calif.",
        "The Broadway hit that \u2019 s set during a revolution may have set off a revolution of its own, too. Right now, Hamilton is the hardest thing to get on Broadway. It \u2019 s been called a experience. But it \u2019 s safe to say the unconventional smash wasn \u2019 t always a sure thing. The play portrays the life of Alexander Hamilton, a founder of the United States who was once a poor, orphaned girl \u201d dropped in the middle of a hot spot of the Caribbean \u201d \u2014 and it does so in the rhymes and rhythms of and pop.",
        "FBI Director James Comey gave a speech this week about encryption and privacy, repeating his argument that \u201dabsolute privacy\u201d hampers law enforcement. But it was an offhand remark during the QA session at Kenyon College that caught the attention of privacy activists: The thought of the FBI chief taping over his webcam is an arresting one for many. His comment Wednesday (which is around the 1:34:45 mark in this video) was in response to a question about growing public awareness of the ways technology can spy on people, and he acknowledged sharing in the surveillance anxiety.",
        "After five decades of Graham Nash\u2019s voice is hard to mistake: It\u2019s that light, airy tenor you hear in his work with The Hollies and Crosby, Stills Nash. As a kid, he honed that voice singing along to The Everly Brothers in his bedroom, filling in the notes above the duo\u2019s signature close harmonies. Years later, on a 1992 tour stop in Ohio, his dream of being the third Everly suddenly came true. \u201dThe phone rings in my hotel room, and it was Phil Everly,\u201d Nash says.",
        "Hunting down that obscure Vietnamese place that serves up b\u00e1nh bao exactly like you\u2019d find in Hanoi, or an Indian joint with dal just like the one you had on that trip to New Delhi, is a not uncommon pursuit in these days. But our culinary hunt for \u201dauthentic ethnic\u201d food can be a sword, says Krishnendu Ray. Ray is the chair of the food studies program at New York University and author of the new book The Ethnic Restaurateur.",
        "On the way into the Colorado Republican Party\u2019s state convention in Colorado Springs Saturday morning, a Ted Cruz supporter waved a big broom with the letters \u201dCRUZ\u201d fastened to the top. The convention took place in a hockey arena, and the prop is probably familiar to most sports fans. The Cruz supporter was looking for a sweep, and a sweep was what he got. Cruz picked up all 34 Republican National Convention delegates that Colorado Republicans awarded this week.",
        "It\u2019s been a big week for supporters of paid family leave. The city of San Francisco and the state of New York took groundbreaking steps toward new and more generous leave policies. Advocates hope the moves will create momentum in other places that are considering similar measures. \u201dI do believe this will pave the way for other states,\u201d says Dina Bakst, the of A Better Balance, a nonprofit in New York that advocates for policies in the workplace.",
        "It takes a village to move a dog. In the past seven years, my family and I have moved to three continents: from Maryland to the Kenyan highlands in Nairobi then on to Kathmandu in Nepal\u2019s Himalayas and, most recently, to Ankara in Turkey\u2019s central Anatolian steppe. We\u2019ve repeatedly packed our worldly belongings in a container and then said goodbye for months as they\u2019ve traveled by sea via multiple ports and then overland by truck to our next destination.",
        "Many of the kids who left Central America for the U. S. two years ago are still waiting to see if they\u2019ll be granted asylum. Tens of thousands came on foot, escaping gang violence, hoping if they got here they would get to stay. The ones who made the journey without their parents have been called unaccompanied minors, child migrants or asylum seekers. A new play, Shelter, gives them names and tells their stories.",
        "When it comes to clothes these days, maybe you should ask: What\u2019s your waste size? You know you have those clothes sitting in your closet: That shirt you spent less than $10 on because it looked cool for a second, or that skirt you only wore once before it went out of fashion. Fashion cycles are moving faster than ever. A Quartz article in December revealed how fashion brands like Zara, Gap and Adidas are churning out new styles more frequently, a trend dubbed \u201dfast fashion\u201d by many in the industry.",
        "If you\u2019re a farmer who wants to stay small and independent, you\u2019re under an increasing amount of pressure these days. By the Department of Agriculture\u2019s count, a startling 97 percent of all the country\u2019s farms are \u2014 but that\u2019s because many small family farms turned into big family farms, or collections of farms, which turned into big businesses. Smaller family operations, like Vern Jantzen\u2019s farm in Nebraska, account for less than a quarter of everything produced on American farms.",
        "On a small Israeli military base at Nahal Oz, next to the Gaza border, there\u2019s a windowless room where soldiers peer 24 hours a day at video screens. They\u2019re watching live footage from cameras monitoring the Gaza Strip, controlled by the militant group Hamas. Soldiers see a lot \u2014 a damaged home getting slowly repaired after the 2014 war, donkeys guided by farmers, suspected Hamas militants on motorcycles. But they can\u2019t see underground, where tunnels beneath the border may pose the biggest threat to Israel here. In the observation room, the soldiers monitoring the screens are all female.",
        "In Brazil, one of the biggest challenges to dealing with the Zika crisis is logistics. The South American country has bad infrastructure, unequal access to health care \u2014 and it\u2019s huge. It\u2019s difficult for a mom with a microcephalic baby who lives in the countryside, hours away from specialists, to get the help she needs. But one doctor has developed a system that could revolutionize medicine in Brazil \u2014 and has already helped tens of thousands of babies. Dr. Sandra Mattos, a pediatric cardiologist, checks in with her tiny patients from her laptop.",
        "The headquarters for the U. S. military\u2019s longest war isn\u2019t at the Pentagon. It\u2019s here at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, a modest brick building in suburban Washington. Like most military campaigns, this one requires volunteers. Their mission is to place a bare arm atop a mug of mosquitoes and sit still while the parasites enjoy a feast. The volunteers will get malaria, and this allows the military to see how humans respond to treatment. \u201dIt\u2019s the Malaria Challenge model,\u201d said Debra Yourick, director of science education at the institute.",
        "The federal government is cleaning up a long legacy of uranium mining within the Navajo Nation \u2014 some 27, 000 square miles spread across Utah, New Mexico and Arizona that is home to more than 250, 000 people. Many Navajo people have died of kidney failure and cancer, conditions linked to uranium contamination. And new research from the CDC shows uranium in babies born now. Mining companies blasted 4 million tons of uranium out of Navajo land between 1944 and 1986. The federal government purchased the ore to make atomic weapons.",
        "Live in a place long enough and you\u2019ll see it start to change: new people in your neighborhood, new buildings reshaping an old skyline. Washington, D. C. is no exception. Tarica June is a lawyer in D. C. as well as a local emcee, who writes and produces her own music on the side. One of her songs has received a lot of attention both in and out of Washington.",
        "In 1913, the Ronald Tolkien should have been studying for his exams. He was halfway through his Classics degree \u2014 the subject all the best students did at Oxford in those days. Getting admitted to Oxford on a scholarship was a great opportunity for young Ronald, an orphan who had always struggled to stay out of poverty. A Classics degree would have set him up for almost any career he chose. But he wasn\u2019t studying. Instead, he was trying to teach himself Finnish.",
        "In 1964, two guys walked into a movie studio. One of them was Buster Keaton, a silent film master of physical comedy, and the other was Samuel Beckett, a master of cerebral literature. They were there to make a movie together, and now a new movie tells the story of their unlikely collaboration. Beckett and Keaton\u2019s project was called Film, and the new account of that project \u2014 created by former UCLA archivist Ross Lipman \u2014 is called Notfilm. Lipman was fascinated by the collaboration.",
        "Former Mexican President Vicente Fox is a fierce critic of presidential candidate Donald Trump, repeatedly denouncing what he says are his \u201dracist and ignorant ideas.\u201d Trump \u201dsays that he\u2019ll make America great again,\u201d Fox writes this week in The Guardian, \u201dbut I believe he\u2019s only making it worse.\u201d In his frequent tweets about Trump, Fox has called him \u201dcrazy,\u201d \u201dpathetic\u201d and a \u201dloser.\u201d Fox, who served as president of Mexico from 2000 to 2006, also says he views Trump as a \u201ddictator.\u201d He joins a growing number of prominent Mexicans who are speaking out more forcefully against the Republican candidate,",
        "About six years ago, Anthony Gonzalez left the small French coastal town where he\u2019d spent his first three decades and moved to Los Angeles in search of greater things. In at least one way, he found them: His band M83, already a hit in indie circles, had a breakthrough in 2011 with the album Hurry Up, We\u2019re Dreaming. Gonzalez says his latest album, Junk, developed as a way to reconnect with his past \u2014 and that it all starts with melody."
