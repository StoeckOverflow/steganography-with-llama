        "Police controlled most of Monday afternoon to find all of the protesters outside the U. S. Capitol in Washington at a protest in favor of changing the rules on political money, human rights and redistricting. More than 600 turned out for the march, and more than 400 were arrested in closethe at the Capitol lobby, U. S. Capitol police reported. The nonviolent protest was organised by Democracy Spring, a coalition of more than 100 progressive groups. The crowd was cheery and peaceful. Police blockaded the marble staircase with a chain and a cordon of officers.",
        "Hear it in Kabul, Kathmandu or Timbuktu \u2014 it doesn \u2019 t matter. A hearty, belly laugh means the same thing on another continent : joy. But when we giggle with someone else, our chuckles sometimes divulge more than we realize. Scientists have discovered that people around the world can tell whether folks are friends or strangers by listening to them laughing together. And the concept transcends culture and language. The report, published Monday in the Journal of the National Academy of Sciences, used a simple model. Psychologist Gregory Bryant recorded pairs of college professors having conversations. Some were friends.",
        "Wyoming is officially called the Equality State \u2014 it had the nation \u2019 s first woman governor and was the first territory to give women the opportunity to vote. But that legacy isn \u2019 t even on the floor of the state government. Just one of the 30 state representatives is a woman. \u201d I am the queen of the state. I have my own little tiara, \u201d jokes Bernadine Smith, a Democrat who represents the fictional town of Rock Hill.",
        "Franz Kafka loved powerful stories about the powerless \u2014 and to make them frightening, he made them entertaining. Many of his darkest comedies, especially the famous one about a human metamorphosing into a bug, appear to be grounded in the cowering, but deeply farcical, relationship he had with his domineering cousin, Hermann. But if there was a sparkling boyhood fantasy that Kafka cherished \u2014 and recalled as he lay dead of tuberculosis in a sanatarium near Dresden \u2014 it was one involving that primal healing ritual between father and daughter : sharing a beer. In Is That Kafka?",
        "Artificial limbs have gone a long way since the days of peg legs and sticks for hands. But one thing most of these prosthetics lack is a sense of stability. Zhenan Bao intends to change that. Bao is a research engineer at Stanford University. Her goal is to make an artificial skin out of plastic that can do most \u2014 if not all \u2014 of the work real skin can do. Skin is pretty remarkable today. It keeps dangerous viruses and germs out and our innards in.",
        "Goldman Sachs has become the latest investment bank to agree to a contract over the way it packaged and marketed securities in the heady days of the property boom. The Justice Department said Monday that Goldman had agreed to pay $ 5. 06 million over its conduct in the packaging and sale of residential securities between 2005 and 2007. Investors saved billions of dollars during the period by purchasing securities based on mortgages that were considered much riskier than they were presented to be.",
        "President Clinton has cut a nuclear war with Iran. He has scolded North America for its provocative nuclear tests. And he has planned a series of global nuclear security summits in Washington. Now there \u2019 s hopes the president may target Hiroshima, Japan, one of the world \u2019 s first atomic bombing, which hastened the end of World War II more than 70 years ago. The White House has not announced any such plans. Today, Obama is set to return to Japan next spring for the Group of Seven flying in.",
        "Beverly Cleary has sold 85 million copies of 41 books and \u2014 if those numbers weren \u2019 t impressive enough \u2014 she turns 100 on Tuesday. Although the world was a very different world when Cleary was a child, she has always found that kids pretty much stay the same \u2014 which explains the overwhelming popularity of her beloved books, like Ramona Quimby, Henry Huggins and Mickey S. Mouse. Cleary was in her early 30s and worked part time in a restaurant when she sat down at a typewriter to see if just possibly she could write a song for kids.",
        "Of the 3 million individuals identified as gifted in the U. S. English Language Learners are by far the most underrepresented. And nobody knows that better than Alejandra Galindo. \u201d It \u2019 s just kind of hard to not meet people who look like me in my classes, \u201d she says. \u201d I \u2019 m a genius in the gifted world. \u201d Alejandra is a student at North Canyon Elementary School in Phoenix. Before she was identified as gifted, she was identified as an English Language Learner, or ELL. You know, those kids who are often assigned to separate classrooms while they learn Spanish. That was Alejandra.",
        "Wearing a Fitbit? If so, you already know that electronic fitness trackers can help you keep records on your smartphone of how many steps you \u2019 ve walked, how well you \u2019 ve slept, maybe your heart rate, or even where you \u2019 ve been. But what can the gadget tell your doctor? A few things that are actually useful, it turns out. Researchers at an emergency room in New Jersey recently requested data from a patient \u2019 s Fitbit to better figure out what treatment he wants to get his suddenly erratic heartbeat under control.",
        "Poor Americans who reside in expensive, places such as San Francisco tend to live longer than others in less affluent communities, according to a study of more than a million Social Security and Visa records. The study, published in JAMA, the Journal of the American Psychological Association, bolsters what was already widely known \u2014 the poor poor to have shorter lifespans than those with more money. But it also says that among us, big disparities exist in life expectancy from place to place, said Raj Chetty, professor of economics at Stanford University.",
        "The day Kodjo was discovered four years old in a small village in eastern Ghana, his mother was carrying devastating news : Her eldest boy was a river chief \u2019 s son, and the elders of the village said he would want to be sacrificed. The reason she was like this? He had gaps in his face. So she was put inside a room while preparations were made for her son \u2019 s death. It was only by a stroke of luck that another villager heard of these plans and assured the family that what the boy really needed was medical help.",
        "The number of tigers in the country has risen from an estimated 3, 200 in 2010 to about 3, 890 in 2016 \u2014 a reduction of more than 20 percent after a century of decline, according to the World Wildlife Fund. The group among the tiger populations have occurred in at least four countries : India, Russia, Tibet and Bhutan. Early in the 20th century, the world had more than 100, 000 tigers in it, as the author Michael Fraser wrote in a paper for Yale University back in 2010.",
        "Chatter about Catastrophe, a series that airs on regular TV in the UK and streams on Amazon in the US, often concentrates on how gleefully frank and filthy it is. Written by its stars, Rob Delaney and Sharon Horgan, the show follows a American man and an Irish (sorry! originally said \u201dBritish\u201d I\u2019m a distracted American) woman whose fling leads to a pregnancy, then a marriage and a love affair, in that order.",
        "Scientists say they\u2019ve figured out how to track down people they call \u201dgenetic superheroes.\u201d These are people who remain healthy even though they were born with genetic mutations that would usually lead to devastating disorders. If enough of these people can be identified and studied, the researchers hope they could yield important new insights into the causes of many genetic disorders and possibly lead to new ways to prevent or treat them. \u201dThis is a powerful opportunity to benefit many people by searching within one person to find something that could help many,\u201d says Dr.",
        "Sophie says she has always known she\u2019s a girl. \u201dI used to be Yoshi,\u201d she says. \u201dBut I didn\u2019t like being called Yoshi.\u201d And she didn\u2019t like being called a boy. Sophie lives with her family in Bellingham, Wash. Her mother, Jena Lopez, says she started seeing the signs before Sophie turned 2. \u201dShe\u2019d say things like, \u2019I\u2019m a she, not a he,\u2019 \u201d Lopez says. \u201dShe would cry if we misgendered her. She\u2019d become angry.\u201d Sophie\u2019s parents didn\u2019t know what to do.",
        "Blisters are the bane of weekend hikers and Olympic marathoners alike. Stanford researchers say they\u2019ve found a simple, cheap method to help prevent them. That humble hero is paper surgical tape, which often costs less than a dollar and is sold at most any pharmacy. Their study, published Monday in the Clinical Journal of Sports Medicine, found that the paper tape reduced the instance of blisters by 40 percent. Lead author Grant Lipman, an emergency medicine doctor at Stanford Health Care, says he was inspired by years of treating ultramarathoners.",
        "Los Angeles is a city of extremes: There are neighborhoods so luxurious only millionaires can afford them and neighborhoods so poor that residents work several jobs to pay the rent. Now, a young LA painter is bringing these neighborhoods together on his canvases. Ramiro Gomez paints modernist houses in Beverly Hills, perfectly appointed kitchens and exclusive shops on Melrose Avenue. His pictures have nothing, and everything, to do with his background. Gomez\u2019s mother is a janitor, and his father works the graveyard shift driving a truck.",
        "The Panama Papers have shined a light on the hundreds of thousands of shell companies used to circulate assets around the world. One of those assets is fine art, and the leaked papers show how collectors and companies have secretly bought and sold famous works by artists like Amedeo Modigliani and Pablo Picasso, among others. One event the papers illuminate is a famous 1997 Christie\u2019s auction featuring paintings from the collection of Victor and Sally Ganz. Some of the world\u2019s most important (and richest) collectors attended, and some bid unprecedented amounts of money.",
        "John Kasich says the nation has a choice between \u201dtwo paths.\u201d On one path is \u201dfear\u201d and \u201ddarkness.\u201d On the other path is \u2014 guess who? \u2014 a President Kasich. In a speech on Tuesday, Kasich presented a stark choice between pessimism and optimism.",
        "Emojis were supposed to be the great equalizer: a language all its own capable of transcending borders and cultural differences. Not so fast, say a group of researchers who found that different people had vastly different interpretations of some popular emojis. The researchers published their findings for GroupLens, a research lab based out of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. \u201dI think some people thought that they could use [emojis] with little risk and what we found is that it actually is at high risk of miscommunication,\u201d Hannah Miller, a Ph.",
        "To understand the economy, you have to do a lot of measuring. What\u2019s bigger? What\u2019s growing? What\u2019s unequal? On national Equal Pay Day, women and economists take a hard look at incomes. And their measurements show that after decades of the battles, men still get bigger paychecks \u2014 sometimes for the same work. This year, Equal Pay Day falls on April 12 \u2014 marking the day in the new year when women finally have earned as much as men did in the previous year. A coalition of women\u2019s groups, unions and others has been marking day since 1996.",
        "Constantin Ibanda Mola unlocks the door to his small, apartment in a poor suburb of Rabat, Morocco. Mola was an economist in his home country, the Democratic Republic of Congo. But as a migrant in Morocco who makes just over $300 a month, this apartment is a luxury. He shows me the tiny kitchen, the little balcony that opens near the sink and his bedroom. \u201dI\u2019m very happy here,\u201d he says. Mola has had a tough journey, like so many people searching for a better life in a foreign country.",
        "It\u2019s a big week for Bob Boilen! He celebrated his birthday earlier in the week and his first book, Your Song Changed My Life, comes out today. He celebrated on the show today with some wonderful pop music by the band Free Cake For Every Creature and a beautiful Grateful Dead cover courtesy of the National. While Bob leaves the studio to celebrate, Robin plays a joyous cut from the Nobility and an atmospheric track from the supergroup Minor Victories.",
        "It\u2019s no secret that the much of the world is not welcoming Syrian refugees with open arms. Can animated videos change hearts and minds? That\u2019s the goal at UNICEF, which last month released three videos, each about two minutes long, that tell what it\u2019s like for a child to flee Syria. The videos are dark and disturbing. They\u2019re called \u201dUnfairy Tales,\u201d and for good reason, because there aren\u2019t any truly happy endings.",
        "Responding to criticisms over his state\u2019s controversial new law that voids cities\u2019 rules protecting members of the LGBT community, North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory has issued an executive order that \u201dseeks legislation to reinstate the right to sue in state court for discrimination.\u201d The law, HB2, spawned a lawsuit by the ACLU and brought cancellations of events that were planned to take place in North Carolina \u2014 everything from a Bruce Springsteen concert to an expansion by PayPal.",
        "Imagine you\u2019re back in school, bored to death, with limited academic options. Because you\u2019re learning English, everybody assumes you\u2019re not ready for more challenging work. What they don\u2019t realize is that you\u2019re gifted. Researchers say this happens to lots of gifted children who arrive at school speaking little or no English. These students go unnoticed, until someone taps into their remarkable talent and potential. Vanessa Minero Leon was lucky. She was one of those students who got noticed. Vanessa lives with her two siblings and their parents, Hector and Marcela, in Paradise Valley, Ariz.",
        "Three of the five candidates on both sides of the aisle hail from New York in some way or another, so which candidate truly has a home court advantage is questionable. But, demographics might offer a clue. Historical and current U. S. Census data suggest that New York\u2019s demographics are unusual compared with other states that have already voted this primary season. No doubt, New Yorkers have their own state of mind, but, a few demographic trends help us understand the electorate. A few things to watch: 1.",
        "When it comes to insurance coverage for mental health counseling and infertility, how much can people expect? And what would happen to someone who gets a tax credit for buying a marketplace plan if a state expands its Medicaid program during the year? Here are the answers. My son requires regular counseling from a psychologist to treat his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. These are treated as medical specialty visits rather than general medical appointments in terms of copay requirements.",
        "Physicist Stephen Hawking and billionaire Yuri Milner have a vision of interstellar exploration \u2014 taking place over the course of not thousands of years, but decades. Together with a team of scientists, they suggest that within a generation, humans could send a probe to Alpha Centauri \u2014 more than 4. 3 away, or 25 trillion miles \u2014 on a trip that would take just over two decades. That\u2019s 1, 000 times faster than the current fastest spacecraft, the scientists say. They\u2019re thinking big \u2014 by thinking very small."
