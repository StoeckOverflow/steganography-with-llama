        "There is a revolution coming on in America. Nearly 13 million Americans have permits to operate concealed handguns \u2014 triple the numbers just nine years ago \u2014 and that figure is low because not much state reports. It \u2019 s puzzling that so many Americans are choosing to protect themselves at a time when the FBI shows us violent crime and property crime have been rising dramatically for two decades. In search of handgun permit requests, I drove out to the Texas Firearms Center, an outdoor gun extravaganza based near Austin where firearms fanciers get to shoot anyone they see.",
        "A leading developer of home and garden care says it will stop funding a class of pesticides linked to the use of bees. Ortho, part of the coalition, says the decision to halt the use of the chemicals \u2014 include neonicotinoids, or neonics for short \u2014 comes after seeing the range of possible threats to bees and other pollinators. \u201d While agencies in the U. S. are still evaluating the health impact of neonics on pollinator populations, it \u2019 s time for Ortho to move on, \u201d says Jim Martin, the general owner of the Ortho Brand.",
        "After months of investigation, U. S. health officials now say that the Zika virus is primarily the cause of severe liver damage in the infants of some children who were infected with the virus during pregnancy. A CDC review published every Wednesday in the New York Journal of Medicine provided evidence of what U. S. medical officials now call a causal relationship between the virus and a severe lack of microcephaly and intracranial calcifications. The study marks a starting point in the current Zika epidemic, says Dr. Richard Frieden, chief of the CDC.",
        "Donald Trump is no typical politician \u2014 and his wife Melania is not a typical political wife. Melania Trump says she \u2019 s spent most of her time at home, caring for the couple \u2019 s son, Donald. But lately, the former husband and native of Slovenia has been more constantly on the campaign trail for the couple. At a campaign rally in Washington this month, Trump described his wife as \u201d an incredible woman... an incredible mother. \u201d In particular, she praised her husband as a \u201d party leader. \u201d \u201d He \u2019 s fair, \u201d Melania Trump said.",
        "In India, rape is illegal. And the definition of what makes \u201d rape \u201d was widened only slightly in response to a horrific fatal assault in New York in 2012. Forced penetration by any object in any orifice is now a law. Despite this law, some men in India can have sex with a man against her will. That \u2019 s because Parliament chose to force husbands. This decision \u2014 which makes India one of 49 countries that don \u2019 t criminalize marital rape \u2014 has come under fire from women \u2019 s rights advocates around the world. The U. N.",
        "The leaking of more than 11 million documents from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca earlier this month cast new light on the arcane origins of offshore shell companies, long a favorite meeting place for the very rich. But simply setting up a shell firm turns out to be something that any decent Joe can do. In fact, you can do it in just a bit more time than it takes to form an email account, with the aid of one of the army of PR firms and financial advisers that specialize in them.",
        "The Obama administration has shaken up U. S. diplomacy by reaching out to longtime foes like Cuba, Iran and Russia. This has spurred a debate about what impact, if any, the U. S. moves have on human rights in these countries. Some say that such engagement can encourage authoritarian nations to improve their human rights record, while others argue it makes no difference, or could even lead regimes to ensure they don \u2019 t have to worry about punitive measures for rights violations. The U. S. Justice Department issued its annual human rights advisory Wednesday, which covers issues around the globe.",
        "HBO \u2019 s documentary movie Confirmation chronicles the presidential confirmation battle for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas after Anita Lane, a former employee, admitted he sexually harassed her. NPR \u2019 s Karen Totenberg broke the story to the network in 1991, and she joins the NPR radio podcast team to comment on what happened, how it happened and why it still matters. \u201d I \u2019 d been hearing all day long that there were women who claimed they were harassed by Clarence Thomas when he was at the EEOC and when he was at the Justice Department, \u201d Totenberg said. \u201d But I would never really heard it.",
        "On a cold windy night, Kelly Nissen feeds the cows at the Iowa State Agricultural Beef Nutrition Farm. He weighs out specific rations and carefully delivers them to numbered feed bunks. \u201d When you \u2019 re feeding, you \u2019 re counting yourself to make sure it \u2019 s placed in the right lot, \u201d Nissen said. It \u2019 s important \u2014 because these cows munch on more than just the wrong mix of hay, dairy and distiller \u2019 s grain. They \u2019 re also obsessed with testing out different formulas created by the researchers in the animal research department at Iowa State.",
        "One might think we wouldn \u2019 t be needing to have this discussion right about now, but apparently we do. As you \u2019 ve usually heard by now, this time the peg comes courtesy of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose appearance in a presidential skit during a dinner over the weekend ended with a \u201d surprise \u201d onstage came from Hillary Clinton and Hizzoner \u2019 s use of the phrase \u201d C. P. Time. \u201d For people living with it, that \u2019 s Colored People \u2019 s Time \u2014 usually abbreviated, in the black town I \u2019 ve lived in, to C. F. T. \u2014 and it means.",
        "Some users of LSD believe one of the most profound aspects of the experience is a deep oneness with the drug. The hallucinogenic drug might be causing this by blurring boundaries in the brain, too. The knowledge that the boundaries between yourself and the world around you are erasing correlates to changes in brain structure while on LSD, according to a study published Wednesday in Current Science. Scientists gave 15 cents either a drop of water or a placebo and slid them into an MRI scanner to monitor brain activity.",
        "Ian Burkhart, now 24, was lost in 2010 after diving into a wave in open water. The accident left him with some arm movement but no control of his hands. Then, about two years ago, scientists in Switzerland equipped Burkhart with a system that enabled him to control his right arm and hand with his thoughts. \u201d The first time moving my hand \u2014 that was really just like that kind of hope, \u201d Burkhart told reporters during a media briefing Tuesday.",
        "Springtime is usually beautiful in Mexico City. As the weather warms, the purple jacaranda trees that line boulevards and dot neighborhoods are in full bloom. Everything is prettier, says Fernando Padilla, a driver taking a break in a park. \u201dIt\u2019s my favorite time of the year,\u201d he says. But this spring, his eyes are watering, his throat hurts and one day a week he\u2019s not allowed to use his car on the road, which means he\u2019s poorer too. Julieta Mejia Cabrera, 10, isn\u2019t happy either.",
        "Cody Pedersen and his wife, Inyan, know that in an emergency they will have to wait for help to arrive. Cody, 29, and his family live in Cherry Creek, a Native American settlement within the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation in north central South Dakota. The reservation is bigger than Delaware and Rhode Island combined. But Cherry Creek has no general store, no gas station and few jobs.",
        "It\u2019s a beer with a message \u2014 and its brewers say it\u2019s a simple one. Responding to North Carolina\u2019s HB2 law that voids cities\u2019 rules, two of the state\u2019s brewers are creating a new beer: the Don\u2019t Be Mean to People: A Golden Rule Saison. Three dozen breweries have signed up to sell the beer on their draft taps cans of it will also go to people who have donated to the project\u2019s fundraising campaign, which currently stands at nearly $18, 000 \u2014 far more than the original goal of $1, 150.",
        "If you don\u2019t live in Baltimore, but you know anything about the mayor\u2019s race, it\u2019s probably that an activist with Black Lives Matter is running. He\u2019s known as the guy in the blue vest, but he also goes by DeRay Mckesson. Mckesson is the city\u2019s mayoral candidate, but one of the lowest in the polls. The race for Baltimore\u2019s next mayor was shaken up a year ago, following the death of Freddie Gray, the young black man fatally injured in police custody. After violent protests, current Mayor Stephanie said she would not run again.",
        "No, this isn\u2019t news. If you haven\u2019t yet, you should definitely check out the latest on marriage in China, the coal industry, Bernie Sanders and Chicago policing. But once you\u2019re caught up, you should take five minutes to watch this marble race. And you don\u2019t have to take our word for it. ..

        "Are you ready for some more uncertainty about blood pressure treatment? Decisions about blood pressure have gotten more difficult over the past couple of years as experts in the U. S. have failed to reach consensus on recommendations about when drug therapy should be started. Now there\u2019s new evidence that could make the decisions even more challenging. Let\u2019s review first where there is agreement. Around the world, high blood pressure causes a lot of harm. Your risk of health problems \u2014 such as heart disease, stroke and kidney disease \u2014 increases with higher blood pressure.",
        "There has been a carefully guarded secret in medicine: Evidence is often inconclusive, and experts commonly disagree about what it means. Most medical decisions aren\u2019t cut and dried. Instead they\u2019re usually made with uncertainty about what is best for each person. This uncertainty secret has been revealed in a very public disagreement among experts about who should be treated for high blood pressure. The controversy hinges on the level of blood pressure that should serve as a trigger for treatment.",
        "Finding a new planet that orbits a distant star isn\u2019t such a big deal anymore \u2014 astronomers have discovered around 2, 000. But no one knows if any of these planets has a moon. That might change this year, if a project goes as planned. David Kipping, an astronomer at Columbia University, says his team will use some new techniques and one of the fastest supercomputers in the world to survey around 1, 000 planets. He expects the search to be detailed enough to catch even some pretty small moons, like the ones that orbit Jupiter.",
        "When 276 girls were forced at gunpoint from their dormitory beds at a school in Chibok, Nigeria, on April 14, 2014, it sparked the creation of #BringBackOurGirls. The campaign, originating in Nigeria, became a global sensation as it pressured the Nigerian government and world leaders to rescue the girls from their Boko Haram kidnappers. In the first hours after the kidnapping, a few dozen girls escaped, but 219 girls in their teens essentially disappeared. Two years later, the world\u2019s attention has waned.",
        "The trend has exploded recently. Across the country, menus proudly boast chicken raised by local farmers, pork from heritage breed pigs, vegetables grown from heirloom varieties. These restaurants are catering to diners who increasingly want to know where their food comes from \u2014 and that it is ethically, sustainably sourced. But are these eateries just serving up lies? Laura Reiley, the food critic for the Tampa Bay Times, wanted to find out. So she undertook a rigorous investigation of Tampa\u2019s restaurants, tracking down their sourcing claims. Many of them turned out to be bogus.",
        "Comic W. Kamau Bell finds humor in the parts of America that make him uncomfortable. Speaking to Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross, Bell likens his new CNN series, United Shades of America, to a travel show that takes him \u201dto all sorts of different places that I [am] either afraid to go, or you wouldn\u2019t expect me to go.\u201d \u201dI\u2019ve always been a fan of [Parts Unknown host Anthony] Bourdain,\u201d Bell says. \u201dI always thought if I had a show like that, you would replace food with racism.",
        "One thing I\u2019ve always loved about anthropology is its commitment to understanding humans by bringing to bear two divergent perspectives: evolutionary science, aimed at understanding the contribution of biology to our behavior, and field ethnography, a process whereby the anthropologist works to understand a social group\u2019s lived experience in the modern world from the inside out.",
        "Saying its customers \u201dhave a right to know when the government obtains a warrant to read their emails\u201d \u2014 and that Microsoft has a right to tell them about gag orders \u2014 the tech giant has filed a lawsuit against the U.

        "On Tuesday, theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking and Russian billionaire Yuri Milner announced a plan to send interstellar probes to the Alpha Centauri star system. The audacious project would use a giant laser on Earth to accelerate scores of spacecraft to nearly the speed of light. They would cross the void in just 20 years \u2014 virtually no time on the scale of interstellar travel. The plan for \u201dBreakthrough Starshot\u201d laid out at the news conference looks both ambitious and exciting. But if it\u2019s really going to work, there are several problems these star trekkers will have to overcome.",
        "Bloodletting to keep the \u201dhumors\u201d in balance was a leading medical treatment from ancient Greece to the late 19th century. That\u2019s hard to believe now, in the age of surgery, but \u201ddoctors\u201d trusted lancets and leeches for centuries. To Nobel laureate Carl Wieman, the college lecture is the educational equivalent of bloodletting, one long overdue for revision. \u201dIt\u2019s a very good analogy,\u201d the Stanford professor says. \u201dYou let some blood out and go away and they get well.",
        "Could swallowing the eggs of a parasitic worm help treat a disease? It might just work in some cases, according to the work of P\u2019ng Loke and Ken Cadwell, two researchers at New York University who study parasites and the immune system. Several years ago, Loke got an intriguing phone call from a man with inflammatory bowel disease. It\u2019s an extremely unpleasant illness. Symptoms include chronic painful abdominal cramps, diarrhea and fatigue. The man told Loke that he had become so desperate that he had undergone a risky treatment in Thailand.",
        "Being a trailblazer is tricky: Sure, you\u2019re recognized for doing something no one else had been able to pull off before. But you can also get stuck being \u201dthe one who first. ..\u201d and struggle to stick around as more people try what you\u2019re doing. Carlos Santana has had to deal with both scenarios in a career spanning more than half a century. As I note on Alt. Latino this week, he and the other members of Santana made music history between 1969 and 1972."
