        "It \u2019 s been more than a month since Bernie Sanders and Bill Clinton met on a neutral stage, and let \u2019 s just say they have a few things to work out. In that episode, ( to quote the MTV television classic The Real Thing ) the Democratic race started being polite and started getting real. From a distance, the Republicans have argued over qualifications, including finance, taxes and police transcripts. Thursday night, they can do it face to face. Here are four episodes we \u2019 re watching : 1.",
        "Bernie Sanders \u2019 campaign took to CNN on Thursday morning to denounce accusations made by one of his surrogates at Saturday night \u2019 s massive protest in Washington Square Park in New York City. It was more than an hour before Sanders left the stage, when Sanders supporter Dr. Paul Rosenberg said something that drew cheers from the crowd \u2014 and outrage from fans of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. \u201d Medicare for all will never happen if we continue to hire corporate Democratic whores, who are beholden to Dow Pharma and the industry instead of government, \u201d Song said.",
        "Just how far would Republicans go to secure Donald Trump the winner \u2019 s nomination? A delegate to this month \u2019 s convention in Cleveland suggested that the GOP gathering could do anything it wants. Curly Haugland, a GOP national committeeman from North Dakota, told First Edition on Thursday of his analysis of party rules. Not for the first time, Haugland declared that party rules do not bind any voters to vote for any particular candidate. He argues that even delegates who are \u201d pledged \u201d to Trump or other contenders going to state primary campaigns are, in reality, free to do as they choose.",
        "When Amanda Lipp applied to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital in 2010, her mom thought it might be easy to find a place. Instead, Pam Lipp wrote, \u201d It was a nightmare. \u201d Amanda had been admitted to a psychiatric crisis center during an episode of psychosis but she could live there for only 72 hours. Lipp asked the psychiatric center for help find her a bed and was told she was on her own. So Lipp plugged her phone into the wall in the waiting area and started calling another hospital after the next. They were all terrified.",
        "If ever a show had a theme song, it would be Julian Fellowes \u2014 and the theme music from his hit show Downton Abbey. But now that Downton has ended, Fellowes has turned his flair for family drama and romance to another story, set in modern era. His new neighborhood Belgravia is named for one of Manhattan \u2019 s poshest neighborhoods. It \u2019 s the story of a striving couple harboring a big secret.",
        "In January, a doctor returned home to England after a weeklong trip to Venezuela. Three days later he caught a fever, a rash on his upper arm and face, and pinkeye. He was fine within three days. But about a month later, his partner developed similar symptoms \u2014 a rash, pinkeye and some minor pain in his hands and neck. He went to the doctor \u2019 s room, and a clever physician even thought of Zika virus. The week before the traveler \u2019 s symptoms set in, he had had hot sex with his partner. They \u2019 d been dating for more than 10 years.",
        "This story is part of NPR \u2019 s podcast Embedded, which digs deeper into the stories behind the murders. Warning : Some of the images in the story are graphic. Gang violence is commonplace in El Salvador, one of the most violent countries in the world. But the capital city of San Salvador was brought close to a standstill when gang members started murdering bus drivers one by one in March 2015. It started when a bus attendant was shot and killed earlier one morning. Gangs issued a communique telling Salvadorans not to take bus transportation.",
        "Just more than 24 hours after previous earthquakes struck a small island in southwest Asia, an even stronger quake has hit the same area. The Associated Press quotes a Japanese reporter as saying 19 people were affected, bringing the total for the two big quakes to 29. On Thursday evening local time, magnitude 6. 2 and 6. 0 quakes shook the city of Kumamoto and the surrounding area. They were followed by more than 100 small temblors, according to NHK \u2014 including one registering 5. 0 or stronger, the U. S. Geological Survey says.",
        "When you ride on trains or trains in many areas of the United States, what you hear could be recorded. Go on a New Jersey Transit light rail system in Hoboken or Jersey City, for instance, and you might notice an inconspicuous sign that says \u201d video and information systems in use. \u201d A lot of riders are not happy about it. \u201d Yeah I don \u2019 t like that, \u201d says Ron Dolan of Bayonne, N. J. \u201d I don \u2019 t want conversations being picked up because it \u2019 s too Orwellian for me.",
        "It was a hospital \u2014 but to tell Inka Weissbecker it looked more like a clinic. She had come to South America to check out the country \u2019 s only modern facility for treating women with mental illness. \u201d There was a street leading past these beds with bars on them, \u201d she recalls. \u201d Behind one set of drawers I saw a mattress covered in plastic. And on it was urine and feces \u2014 and this lady lying with her face to the floor. I don \u2019 t know if she was dead or just dying.",
        "Step into New Moon \u2019 s Madison, Wis. coffee roasting plant and the aroma of beans \u2014 from Vietnam to Laos \u2014 immediately washes over you. Paul says he aims to maintain an efficient and safe process \u2014 and that starts the minute beans spill out of the roaster. He points to a garbage can that is \u201d designed to draw smoke from the room over the beans and exhausts that pour out of the facility. So it is really like a lot of all of the gases come off the coffee, \u201d he explains. Why are these people so worrisome?",
        "Welcome to Guest Dose. Every month, ABC Music \u2019 s Recommended Dose crew finds a knowledgeable and experienced to share with us their personal perspectives on culture and music, and make a listen from some new tracks they are creating. It is not hard to tell that Janette Pitruzzello is like music for life. The giveaway is confirmed there in one of the anecdotes the who as JNETT ( sometimes pronounced \u2019 Nett ) has been one of Melbourne, Australia \u2019 s club cornerstones for nearly five decades, inserts into the conversation every minutes of us sharing on Skype.",
        "Jordin has worked as a resident nurse at the emergency department at St. Francis Hospital in Hartford, Conn. for three years. She describes her workplace as lights going off, voices ringing, every room empty. \u201d You look around and the hallways are full of patients on stretchers you walk out to the emergency room and you can see on our monitors that there \u2019 s 15 people signing in, \u201d she says.",
        "Foods made with corn masa flour \u2014 like tortillas, tacos and tamales \u2014 could soon play a critical role in the health of babies born to Latina mothers in the U. S. That\u2019s because, as of today, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration is now allowing manufacturers to fortify their corn masa foods with folic acid. That\u2019s a synthetic form of folate, a B vitamin that helps prevent severe defects of the brain and spinal cord when consumed by women before and early in pregnancy.",
        "If you snip a bit of DNA from a vegetable, but add no new genes, does that vegetable qualify as a genetically modified organism, or GMO? It\u2019s a hot question for government regulators, and it\u2019s no longer theoretical. Yinong Yang, a researcher at Penn State University, used a popular gene editing tool called to snip out a tiny piece of DNA from one particular gene in a white button mushroom. This disables the gene, which in turn reduces the mushroom\u2019s production of an enzyme called polyphenol oxidase. As a result, the mushroom doesn\u2019t turn brown so quickly.",
        "Zika\u2019s arrival in the U. S. this summer seems almost inevitable, health officials keep saying. The virus has already touched down in northern Mexico and Puerto Rico. And just this week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the number of states with mosquitoes was larger than previously thought. So the looming question is: Once Zika is here, how big will the outbreak be? No one has a crystal ball, especially when it comes to infectious diseases.",
        "Sturgill Simpson\u2019s 2014 album, Metamodern Sounds In Country Music, took a lot of people by surprise. While the song forms were firmly rooted in Nashville traditions, the stories he told and observations he made were more like something from a metaphysical guide, with existential meditations on death and dying, religion and the search for a higher purpose. For his A Sailor\u2019s Guide To Earth, Simpson finds even more ways to surprise.",
        "On this week\u2019s show, Stephen Thompson takes the week off to tend to his house full of cats while both All Things Considered host Audie Cornish and superlibrarian and Two Bossy Dames Margaret H. \u201dHulahoop\u201d Willison join me and Glen Weldon to talk about romantic comedy. In our first segment, we concentrate on The Mindy Project, which both is a romantic comedy and comments on the tropes of romantic comedy, and which has just returned from a midseason break over on Hulu.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s Colorado supporters are gathering at the state capital Friday to make some noise about a political process they say has left them voiceless. The backlash from Trump\u2019s supporters has included thousands of voicemails and texts a day to the state Republican Party\u2019s chairman, some threatening, after his phone number was leaked online. The protest comes in response to last weekend\u2019s state assembly, where Texas Sen. Ted Cruz succeeded in locking up all of the state\u2019s 34 open Republican National Convention delegates, shutting Trump out of all but a handful of alternate slots.",
        "Seratones A. J. Haynes takes gospel into the garage, and what comes out is fiery rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. The Shreveport, La. band is a joy to see and hear, and this Tiny Desk concert provides an explosive peek at what you\u2019ll soon hear on the group\u2019s debut album, Get Gone. Haynes grew up singing in the Brownsville Baptist Church, learning to sing out to and hit that back wall without a microphone. At the same time, bassist Adam Davis heard a lot of American rock\u2019s greatest guitarist, Jimi Hendrix, as well as the amazing voice of Janis Joplin.",
        "Bonnie Rice was released from prison last year. After a prison sentence, she knew she couldn\u2019t go back to any of the people who led her into trouble. \u201dI didn\u2019t know where to go, how to go,\u201d Rice says with a quiver in her voice. \u201dIt was scary.\u201d She was completely alone. She managed to find a place to live in a halfway house. But even though she filled out lots and lots of job applications in the first few months out of prison, she didn\u2019t get many calls back. \u201dPeople look down on you,\u201d she says.",
        "In 1991, a political drama mesmerized the nation. A law professor named Anita Hill had made a stunning accusation \u2014 that Clarence Thomas, then a Supreme Court nominee, had sexually harassed her when she worked for him at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The events that ensued are now the subject of the HBO film Confirmation, which premieres Saturday at 8 p. m. ET. Kerry Washington, who you probably know best as Olivia Pope on Scandal, plays Hill, who was very reluctant to reveal this secret.",
        "The migrants on rafts began landing on the rocky shores of Lesbos a year ago. In a pretty village of colorful fishing boats, one of the first people they saw was Efstratia Mavrapidou, 89, who was born here. She\u2019s fragile, her eyes clouded by cataracts. But she made her way to shore by cane. She wanted to be there to embrace the migrants crowded onto those rafts, especially the young mothers who wept as they clasped tiny, babies. Many were war refugees from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.",
        "Three years ago, NPR visited the port of Suape outside the northern Brazilian city of Recife when it was an example of Brazil\u2019s booming economy. Brazil\u2019s state oil company, Petrobras, has a large refinery that was working full tilt. Today the scene is very different. That big Petrobras refinery still operates but it\u2019s had big layoffs. It\u2019s partially shuttered, weeds are growing on the side of the pavement. It\u2019s emblematic of what\u2019s happened here and in many parts of Brazil. Last year, this northeastern state of Pernanbuco lost 89, 500 jobs, the most in the country.",
        "Think about our planet for a second. Earth has an elliptical \u2014 \u2014 orbit. That means we\u2019re closer to the sun for one part of the year and farther away another part of the year. Does that fact explain why it\u2019s hotter in the summer and colder in the winter? Lots of kids think it does. Lots of adults think so too. And they\u2019re wrong.* Philip Sadler is both a professor of astronomy and the director of the science education department at Harvard University, and he is obsessed with wrong answers like these.",
        "Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Fern\u00e1ndez will probably never attend another Communist Party Congress. At 92, he\u2019s the oldest delegate to take part in the meeting of Cuba\u2019s top communist leaders that convenes on Saturday. With the island\u2019s closed economy slowly opening to the world and relations with the United States warming, you\u2019d think the \u2019s attendance at an elite gathering that could determine Cuba\u2019s future wouldn\u2019t be front page news. But that was one of the few peeks into this year\u2019s congress revealed in Cuba\u2019s official newspaper Granma.",
        "The scene: a wedding on a ship in New Zealand\u2019s Akaroa Harbour. The rings: known here as rigatoni, and made of pasta. The happy couple: Pastafarians Toby Ricketts and Marianna Fenn, in full pirate regalia. The officiant: Karyn Martyn, New Zealand\u2019s first \u201dministeroni.\u201d The wedding feast: pasta. Only pasta. (OK, there was some cake, too.) Welcome to the first official wedding of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, according to The Associated Press. The group was inspired by a 2005 satirical letter calling for greater separation of church and state.",
        "After their first child was born in 2014, Mohammed Salameh, 22, and his wife Khoulod Ahmad Suleiman, 21, planned to throw a small party for family and friends with walnuts and cups of hot cinnamon, as is customary in their hometown of Dara\u2019a in southwestern Syria. But when they learned that a cousin in Syria had been killed in fighting the same day, they cancelled the festivities. Two years later, the fighting continues. But so, too, does life in the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, where the young couple gave birth to their second child last month.",
        "The prospect of Donald Trump as the Republican nominee for president has been raising a lot of questions for the GOP. Not just about how the party will fare in November, but what exactly Trump and \u201dTrumpism\u201d means for future of the party. NPR asked four conservative thinkers to weigh in: April Ponnuru, Jonah Goldberg, Pete Wehner and Ben Domenech. All are \u201dreformicons\u201d \u2014 conservative reformers who\u2019ve been thinking and writing about how the GOP could modernize itself, update Reaganomics and reach out to young and minority voters.",
        "Donald Trump has based his presidential campaign on resentment toward the establishment, and some alarmed Republicans have called for national leaders to take Trump down. Of course, this has been tried before \u2014 on a fateful evening five years ago, when stars of politics and comedy made Donald Trump the butt of a national joke. The date: April 30, 2011. The setting: The cavernous Washington Hilton."
