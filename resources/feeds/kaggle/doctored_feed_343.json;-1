        "The Scandinavian singer My bubba started singing vocals after Bubba Tomasdott\u00edr answered an invitation to rent a room in My Larsdotter \u2019 s garage. The name of their band is taken from an anglicized pronunciation of the two brothers \u2019 first names. And while Larsdotter is from Iceland and Tomasdott\u00edr is from Iceland, their music has the feeling of something born in Iceland \u2014 a blend of old rock, blues and bluegrass. The duo \u2019 s debut album, Big Bad Good, combines crisscrossing rock with minimalist instrumentation, interspersed with moments of melody.",
        "When it comes to the trillions of microorganisms that surround our bodies, bacteria need almost all the attention. Plants in our resident microbiota and their collective product \u2014 called the microbiome \u2014 have been linked with a broad range of diseases, from various forms of arthritis to depression. At this stage scientists tend to concentrate on which bacterial species could hinder or maintain health. But our biota includes a menagerie of microbes.",

        "It \u2019 s essentially impossible to win the Democratic nomination without support from politicians. In primaries and caucuses across the country, women make up a solid majority of the Democratic electorate. In Virginia, according to exit poll data, there \u2019 s not a state that \u2019 s voted to date where women made up less than 54 percent of registered voters. And, in Mississippi, girls made up nearly ( 64 percent ) of Democratic primary voters. Women, of course, like any demographic, are not a monolith. Hillary Clinton consistently loses four women ( ages 18 to 29 ) to Bernie Sanders.",
        "During an exchange over how far to raise the minimum wage in Thursday night \u2019 s Democratic debate, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders combined to shout over each other, hands held, fingers pointed, both hoping to get a bit kicked in the face, while the audience cheered and booed in various parts. It was quite a fight. As NPR \u2019 s Ron Elving put it, \u201d Both Sanders and Clinton showed flashes of animosity bordering on shock. \u201d Moderator Wolf Blitzer of CNN attempted several times to break things down, saying, \u201d Please, Senator, please, \u201d over and over.",
        "In 1955, a block of four rare postage stamps was recovered from a display case at a warehouse. Over the years, two were lost, but there were no signs of the others \u2014 until now. Four decades after the heist, one of the \u201d remaining Jenny \u201d stamps has appeared at a New York auction house. \u201d It \u2019 s one of the most remarkable crimes in philatelic history, and there \u2019 s a part of the puzzle now that \u2019 s in place, \u201d says Scott English, the president of the American Philatelic Research Center, according to The Associated Press.",
        "This story is part of an project focused on how voters \u2019 needs of government are shaped by where they live. NPR will show parts of the country not on the official calendar and not crowded with officials following each twist of campaign season. First up : Missouri, the state that most broadly describes America in terms of size, income, age, population and education. The people of Midland, Ill. are not happy with the government.

        "One of the best stories of the election cycle is turnout ( as we \u2019 ve reported a few years now ) : Republican turnout has spiked dramatically beyond 2012 levels, and Democrat turnout has fallen off after the nation \u2019 s mammoth 2008. The tone and the turnout are vastly different between Republicans and Democrats this time, but oddly enough, both parties have something crucial in common : their voters are far less moderate than they were in their last primaries. Let \u2019 s start with the Republican party. The below chart shows the demographic difference between the Republican primary this year and in 2012.",
        "Chicago \u2019 s Jazz Record Mart attracted visitors from all over the world. At times, it used to : Last week, owner Bob Koester quit the store, saying he was just too tired to run it any more. Koester began selling used records when he was a kid in Wichita, Kansas. After moving to Chicago, he opened his own office, as well as his own jazz and funk label, Delmark. But after more than 60 years in business, he decided this spring that it was time to pack it in.",

        "As laptops become smaller and more ubiquitous, and with the advent of tablets, the idea of taking notes by hand just seems to many students today. Typing your notes is faster \u2014 which comes in handy when there\u2019s a lot of information to take down. But it turns out there are still advantages to doing things the way.

        "I confess. I\u2019m a notebook nut. I own dozens and dozens of them. Everything from cheap reporter\u2019s notebooks to Italian leather beauties. I wondered: Am I an analog dinosaur, or are there others out there like me? The first stop in my investigation was, frankly, discouraging. At first glance, a Starbucks on the campus of George Washington University points to the dinosaur conclusion. So plentiful are the laptops and tablets that they outnumber the .

        "Returning to a book you\u2019ve read multiple times can feel like drinks with an old friend. There\u2019s a welcome familiarity \u2014 but also sometimes a slight suspicion that time has changed you both, and thus the relationship. But books don\u2019t change, people do. And that\u2019s what makes the act of rereading so rich and transformative. If you\u2019ve been an avid reader for any amount of time, chances are you\u2019ve revisited a book you love.

        "Three million school children in the U. S. are identified as gifted. That\u2019s roughly the top 10 percent of the nation\u2019s highest achieving students. But Rene Islas, head of the National Association for Gifted Children, says tens of thousands of gifted English language learners are never identified. We sat down with Islas and asked him why. He started out by explaining that there are several different measures for identifying gifted children. The most common in schools is recognizing achievement, above grade level work.
