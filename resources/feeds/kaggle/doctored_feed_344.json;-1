But finding the right balance between tourism and wildlife can be tricky.",
        "In the 100th year of the Pulitzer Prize, The Associated Press \u2019 global reporting story \u201d Seafood from Slaves \u201d won the award for public service. The series of stories chronicled how the construction industry was using enslaved labor to put seafood in restaurant kitchens and restaurants.

        "When Newbery author Kate DiCamillo talks to kids about how she became a writer, she sometimes sends them a photo of her own family. \u201d I could put up this picture of my sister, my brother and me and I would talk to them, \u2019 Who \u2019 s missing? \u2019 \u201d she tells NPR \u2019 s Kelly McEvers. \u201d Clearly it \u2019 s my dad. \u201d And kids get that right away.

        "Boko Haram drew nationwide condemnation two years prior when the Nigerian extremist group killed more than 250 girls from a school in Chibok, in northwestern Nigeria. To this day, most of the boys are still missing. Last week, CNN broadcast a video purportedly showing five of them alive. A few of the girls manage to escape \u2014 including Sa \u2019 a, a pseudonym she uses to identify herself. Last week she joined with members of Congress, renewing calls for the United States to aid Nigeria in the fight against Boko Haram. Sa \u2019 a is pseudonym she uses for her son.",
        "When companies uproot, critics usually point to policies like lower fuel taxes or fewer regulations. But one gun manufacturer, Beretta, blames something entirely different \u2014 a law passed in Maryland to try to curb violent shootings. The company recently moved its factory to Nashville, Tenn. because it violated the law in Maryland affecting its business. The opening day was celebrated with shooting demonstrations and a warm welcome from county officials. The Italian gun maker says it \u2019 s being pulled out of its longtime U. S. location on the outskirts of Washington, D. C.",
        "The city of Hyderabad and the friends and family accused of the marathon bombing victims will never forget the incident when two explosions exploded through the crowd at the race, injuring three people and injuring more than 200. Neither will the family of Sunil Tripathi, but for very different reasons. Their story is covered in the documentary film Help Us Find Sunil Tripathi. Sunil was a medical student from a family. His older sister, Sangeeta, says that growing up, he always surpassed her academically. \u201d [ He ] did so effortlessly, in just an honest way, \u201d she says.",
        "Let \u2019 s come with a choice. Say there \u2019 s a gift in the mail. It \u2019 s meant to help you run your household. You can borrow it to keep the lights on, the water running and food on the tables. Would you rather that thing be for $ 9, 794 or $ 28, 639? It \u2019 s not a trick question. It \u2019 s the number of America \u2019 s schools in big numbers. That $ 9, 794 is how much revenue the Chicago Ridge School District in Illinois earned per child in 2013 ( the amount has been adjusted by Education Statistics to account for regional enrollment differences ).",
        "If you melt at the creaminess of yogurt, hold on. A new study suggested the dairy fats found in butter, yogurt and cheese may potentially protect against Type 2 disease. The research, published in the book Circulation, included 3, 333 adults. Starting in the late 1980s, researchers collected blood samples from the elderly and measured circulating concentrations of biomarkers of dairy fat in their brains. Then, over the next two years, the researchers tracked who amongst the participants developed disease.",

        "Editor \u2019 s notes : This week, to mark the 400th birthday of William Shakespeare \u2019 s birth, we will be running a series of events examining the links between Shakespeare and the Bard. Anyone who has ever celebrated Thanksgiving with family knows that the table is a great space for drama. We talk, we sing, we love, we fight \u2014 or sleep in silence and seethe. And we \u2019 re all stuck there, gnawing on our hind legs, playing out our different roles, unable to just step offstage. That is the very idea William Shakespeare exploited to fill part.",
        "A few years earlier, I received an early leadership award at the annual dinner of a professional society. Before the awards ceremony, the other recipients and I were herded onstage, placed in adjacent boxes, and told to wait for the presentation to begin. The five or seven of us had a lot in common. Though we worked in different areas of psychology, we were at early career stages and had shared interests. But we didn \u2019 t spend our time together talking about topics or ideas \u2014 the work that had won us the awards we were there to receive.",

        "Erika Stallings\u2019 mom was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 28. When it came back in her early 40s, her physicians started looking for clues. \u201dThat\u2019s when the doctors realized there may be something genetic going on, and that\u2019s when she was tested, and found out she was a carrier for BRCA2,\u201d says Stallings. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are genes. Carrying a mutated BRCA gene increases a person\u2019s risk for developing certain cancers, including breast and ovarian cancer. Because Erika Stallings\u2019 mom tested positive, Erika had a 50 percent chance of inheriting a mutated BRCA2 gene.",

        "Editor\u2019s note: This week, to mark the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare\u2019s death, we will be running a series of stories examining the links between food and the Bard. Oh, and in case the headline didn\u2019t clue you in, this post contains sexually explicit language. The eggplant and peach emoji are standard code for racy thoughts these days, but people have been using food as sexual innuendo for centuries. Shakespeare was a pro at the gastronomic double entendre [insert blushing face emoji here].",
        "The National Institutes of Health has suspended work in two facilities that manufacture products given to people who are enrolled in research studies, saying the facilities haven\u2019t complied with safety standards designed to protect people from inappropriate risks. \u201dThere is no evidence that any patients have been harmed, but a rigorous clinical review will be undertaken,\u201d the NIH said in a statement provided to NPR Tuesday.",
        "\u201dDon\u2019t touch that!\u201d \u201dDon\u2019t eat that!\u201d These phrases are well known to children of a certain age. Little kids don\u2019t quite get why eating ice cream for breakfast five days a week is not a good idea. They may be confused about why, exactly, potatoes are food while rocks are, well, not something to put in your mouth. I mean, take a moment to consider that both come from the ground, both are covered in dirt, and both have a shape that could rightly be described as \u201d .\u201d Can I Eat That?",
        "U. S. lawmakers Tuesday once again brought Apple, the FBI, security experts and law enforcement officials to testify on the ongoing debate over encryption and the ability of investigators to access data on electronic devices. A major theme that emerged from this latest hearing (though it\u2019s been discussed by some cybersecurity experts before) was the ability or the need of the FBI to improve its own technical prowess to crack encryption \u2014 something that wouldn\u2019t require the help of the tech companies or other third parties, like the case of the San Bernardino iPhone did.",
        "If you\u2019re like most people in North America, you probably spend most of your time indoors. Leave home in the morning, drive to work, stay in your cube all day, head home again. Ninety percent of our lives are spent inside a built environment of some kind \u2014 ones that we share with millions of invisible microbes. Scientists increasingly recognize that rooms and buildings have their own microbiomes, and that those microbial roommates may affect the health of human inhabitants. Those microbes vary depending on what city you\u2019re in, according to a study published Tuesday.",
        "Last week, I watched in awe as a river of crows made their way across the evening sky toward their roosts south of my house. Listening to the cacophony of their cries, I found myself with a simple question \u2014 is what I\u2019m seeing just instinct or do these crows have their own culture? In fact, do any animals have culture in the same sense we do? Being an astrophysicist, I didn\u2019t have the slightest clue about the answer.",
        "On this week\u2019s All Songs Considered, hosts Bob Boilen and Robin Hilton kick off the show with premieres from upcoming albums by beloved bands.

C. trudging with his mare somewhere in Central Asia, and pausing to quaff a refreshingly tart yogurt drink from his gourd. to the present day, and it seems all you need for your daily dose of friendly flora is to wander into the kitchen and pop a breakfast burrito in the microwave. The market for probiotics is growing so rapidly that probiotics are now showing up in dozens of packaged foods, from drinks to desserts, cold brew coffee and cheese bits.",
        "In Germany, obscene mockery of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan could potentially land you in court \u2014 as comedian Jan Boehmermann discovered last week. In the U. K. obscene mockery of Erdogan could land you \u00a31000. British journalist Douglas Murray was horrified by the recent news that German Chancellor Angela Merkel will be allowing a criminal investigation of comedian Jan Boehmermann, who read an obscene, satirical poem mocking Erdogan on German TV. As the reported last week, the poem included references to Erdogan watching child porn and committing bestiality, as well as kicking Kurds and smacking Christians.",
        "Denise Johnson works two jobs, but neither of them offers health insurance to like her. She signed up for a marketplace plan this year, but for routine medical care Johnson still goes to the free clinic near her home in Charlottesville, Va. The problem is her plan\u2019s deductible of at least $1, 000. She can\u2019t recall the precise figure, but it doesn\u2019t really matter. \u201dIt\u2019s absolutely high,\u201d said Johnson, 58. \u201dWho can afford that?\u201d She struggles to pay her $28 monthly premium.",
        "years ago, the nation was rocked by the largest domestic terrorism attack it had ever experienced. A bomb at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City killed 168 people, including 19 children in a day care center on the ground floor. Within days, Merrick Garland would arrive on the scene to supervise the investigation and prosecution. Most Americans would not hear his name again until last month, when President Obama nominated Garland, now a judge, to the U. S. Supreme Court.",
        "When Defense Secretary Ashton Carter landed in Iraq for a surprise visit this week, he came armed with this news: More than 200 additional U. S. troops are headed to that country. They\u2019ll join the fight to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul from the Islamic State. As that battle unfolds on the ground, a parallel war against ISIS is unfolding in cyberspace. U.

        "Public opinion on marijuana has risen dramatically over the last couple of decades. In the only around 25 percent of Americans thought pot should be legal, according to Gallup. Today, it\u2019s around 58 percent. That\u2019s a really fast change in opinion. In fact, it\u2019s about as fast as Americans\u2019 on marriage \u2014 a change of opinion that was itself remarkably fast. As of 1996, 27 percent of Americans thought marriages should be recognized the same as marriages. Today, it\u2019s 60 percent.",

        "It certainly looks suspicious that more than 125, 000 Democrats were dropped from Brooklyn\u2019s voter rolls between last November and Tuesday\u2019s primary. New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer said that the Board of Elections confirmed the voters were removed and that his office would conduct an audit to see if anything improper was done.",
        "Kanye West sometimes gets himself in trouble with what he says on Twitter. Now, one of his tweets may get used against him in court. Back in February, he tweeted that his new album, The Life Of Pablo, would only be available on Tidal, the streaming music service in which he owns a stake, and \u201dnever never never\u201d on Apple. Well, \u201dnever never never\u201d lasted about six weeks: You can now listen to The Life of Pablo on both Apple Music and Spotify."
