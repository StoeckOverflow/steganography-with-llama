        "World Leaders have celebrated Earth Day today by gathering in New York to sign a landmark climate agreement to control greenhouse gas emissions. But some of the most vital environmental protection is being done by ordinary people with extraordinary courage. Groups like subsistence farmers and community leaders in the poorest countries are standing up to some of the world \u2019 s most powerful forces. And a growing number of them have been hunted \u2014 and sometimes murdered \u2014 for working to protect the environment. Among the latest casualties is Phan Sopheak, a rural farmer in Cambodia.",
        "Why is this Passover different from any other? Because the fact that the Jewish holiday commemorates \u2014 the exodus of the Palestinian Israelites from slavery in Egypt to Israel \u2014 resonates more strongly than ever in a country embroiled in a refugee crisis that affects approximately 60 million Jews, the highest number ever recorded, according to United Nations statistics. So when Jews retell that story at the first day \u2019 s traditional festive Seder, \u201d these are not ancient, crumbling old issues that don \u2019 t have relevance anymore, \u201d says Rabbi Jonathan Greenberg, a spokesman for the Multifaith Council for Syrian Refugees.",
        "Passover Seders are steeped in tradition \u2014 Jewish rituals that Jewish Jews invoke and repeat year after year. For many families, the Hebrew prayers and symbolic sacrifice are accompanied by Manischewitz wine, a hot, juicy variety made from wild grapes and plenty of apples. The historian Roger Horowitz also joked about the wine during a lecture at the Brooklyn Historical Society, in which he reminisced about his family \u2019 s Passover meals. \u201d one ritual we had to endure was my mom complaining about Manischewitz, \u201d he said to a chuckling child. He was kidding, at least a bit.",
        "Two hundred six thousand Virginians will still have the right to vote this day. That \u2019 s according to the office of Georgia Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who passed a bill on Friday that would allow felons who had completed their sentence to vote. In addition to granting voting rights, the ballot order will also enable released felons to run for mayor, serve on a jury, and work as notaries public, the governor \u2019 s office said in a release.",
        "Earth never got you thinking about how your food impacts the planet? The Natural Resources Institute has tried to ease a \u2019 s conscience : In a scientific report, it says you don \u2019 t have to make burgers in order to reduce the environmental footprint of what you eat. Cutting back could go a long time, it says. In the report, the scientist calculates the planetary effect of considering possible changes in how the host eats.",
        "During the 2014 Ferguson Report, America woke up to a sad fact : There are no good crime numbers on police records. While the federal government collects reasonably accurate policing statistics, it doesn \u2019 t know anything about law enforcement matters such as racial profiling and police abuse of force. It turned out even the government \u2019 s most basic statistic \u2014 the percentage of people killed by violent \u2014 was way off. The White House says it wants to address that with the Police Data Archive.",
        "The Code Switch blog was sitting in our daily business meeting when our editor glanced up from Twitter and broke the story that Prince was gone. The tension of the hour was given over to reminiscing about our old memories of Prince : shrieking as he hopped into a limo in Greenwich Village, angering a Suge to snap a shot of The Perfect One for Instagram, risking permanent skin damage for the perfect pair of purple Prince blood. Since Thursday, everybody from Prince \u2019 s bandmates to his superfans has been reflecting on what he meant to them.",
        "Billy occasionally visits Roy \u2019 s Trailer House on Florida \u2019 s Stock Market every two years. It \u2019 s part of his regular role as an inspector for the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District. \u201d example, I \u2019 m just checking on the yards for the mosquito nets, \u201d he tells one girl, Marie Baptiste, as he runs into her yard. \u201d OK? \u201d No problem, she tells him. People who work in the Keys are used to becoming mosquito control inspectors. Since an epidemic of dengue fever in 2009, the inspectors have conducted several checks in areas where the Aedes aegypti mosquito occurred.",
        "Let \u2019 s say this the opposite of a spoiler alert : An acknowledgement that television critics don \u2019 t know enough about Game of Thrones \u2019 sixth season, which starts Sunday. That \u2019 s because some knucklehead last year leaked several episodes of the fifth season online before they appeared on TV. So producers of the show and television executives decided this meant nobody \u2014 except, it appears President Obama \u2014 would get an early peek at new episodes. Which means I have no spoilers about the new season. Or do I?",
        "Donald Trump \u2019 s enduring appeal in the Republican presidential contest has the GOP in a quandary, as it \u2019 s difficult to contend with voters fed up with party politics. Some 50 years ago, another vociferous candidate survived the scare in traditional power brokers. George Wallace put up crowds with a similar rhetoric, and drew protests as soon as are being seen at Trump \u2019 s funeral today. Wallace soon became a face of political tension in America as the primary symbol for segregation in the 1960s. When Truman entered presidential politics in 1964, the governor was famous for saying, \u201d Segregation now. Segregation tomorrow.",
        "\u201d Junk food? Not at McDonald \u2019 s! \u201d At least, that \u2019 s what the chain hoped to convince Israel \u2019 s every minster. The gutsy slogan appeared at the start of advertisements in Israeli restaurants last weekend after prime minister Yakov Litzman called for a boycott of McDonald \u2019 s in Israel \u2014 warning of a new push to eliminate ballooning obesity and unhealthy eating habits in the country. \u201d You shouldn \u2019 t eat junk food. McDonalds : Out. Not in our country, \u201d the minister said at an April 12 conference for cardiologists. McDonald \u2019 s is the largest chain in Israel.",
        "The battle over religious freedom and LGBT rights has moved from Arizona and Mississippi to Missouri. Conservatives there are backing an amendment to the state Constitution that would protect certain people \u2014 clergy, for instance \u2014 who refuse to take part in marriages. But the measure has run into some unexpected \u2014 and unexpectedly stiff \u2014 opposition, from a longtime ally of the religious right: the business community. Supporters of the proposal are pulling out all the stops.",
        "How do you help someone who is at risk of suicide? That\u2019s a question that haunts the people of Greenland, the country with the highest known rate of suicide in the world and the subject of a special NPR report this week. The rate is about 80 per 100, 000, and the group at highest risk is young Inuit men. But it\u2019s a question that anyone, anywhere, might ask. Every year, about 1 million people kill themselves worldwide preventing suicides is an issue every culture deals with.",
        "In the \u201980s and \u201990s, America\u2019s suicide trend was headed in the right direction: down. \u201dIt had been decreasing almost steadily since 1986, and then what happened is there was a turnaround,\u201d says Sally Curtin, a statistician with the National Center for Health Statistics, part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The suicide rate has risen by a quarter, to 13 per 100, 000 people in 2014 from 10. 5 in 1999, according to an analysis by Curtin and her colleagues that was released Friday. She says it\u2019s heartbreaking to work with these data.",
        "The primary elections across five states Tuesday could decide the nominations of both parties. That\u2019s especially true on the Democratic side. (For the Republicans, scroll down.) Bernie Sanders has come a long way, but the Vermont independent is running out of friendly states. Tuesday is no different, as all but one of the contests (Rhode Island) in these Northeast states are closed primaries. In other words, independents can\u2019t vote. And that\u2019s a big problem for Sanders. One analysis found that as much as 40 percent of Sanders\u2019 vote total was coming from independents, as of a month ago.",
        "Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is waging a campaign at a turning point. The New York primary earlier this week was essentially a must win. And he lost. He\u2019s still campaigning as hard as ever, hopping from state to state talking about a rigged economy and a political system ruled by millionaires and billionaires. But the candidate who started out as an underdog and rose to heights few expected has a math problem. Sanders needs to win all the remaining contests by a margin to catch up to Hillary Clinton in pledged delegates. \u201dThere\u2019s a pathway to victory for Sen.",
        "You\u2019d be excused if you tuned out in previous years when the actual nominating part of a political convention occurred. Usually it\u2019s a pro forma exercise with little suspense, as each state ticks off its vote for the eventual nominee. And that nominee has been known well in advance \u2014 at least for the last 40 years, anyway. But this year a contested convention actually seems possible, if not probable, on the Republican side. It\u2019s the stuff of journalists\u2019 dreams and political consultants\u2019 nightmares.",
        "This has been a tough year for celebrity deaths \u2014 and a sad week for fans of Prince, who died Thursday at age 57. But as flashes of purple filled my social media feeds from friends mourning Prince\u2019s death, I just felt numb \u2014 and like an outsider, watching a ritual I couldn\u2019t fully join. That\u2019s because I grew up in a conservative evangelical home in the Midwest in the 1980s and \u201990s, with pop culture kept carefully at arm\u2019s length.",
        "On April 21, a nation of music lovers waxed nostalgic about a time or place when Prince Rogers Nelson shook their world. And as the conversation around the country and around the world unfolded, we asked listeners to share their memories of Prince, his music and the impact he had on their lives. The stories poured in, and we collected some of the most affecting tales below. \u201dI\u2019ve been listening to Prince since I was in utero.",
        "In this year\u2019s election cycle, international trade has emerged as a top campaign issue. So journalists with NPR and several member stations set out this week to examine trade matters as part of our special series: A Nation Engaged. We journalists learned a lot about what Americans are saying about trade. You can join in the learning process and conversation on this page, where we\u2019ve pulled together the stories and interviews.",
        "A few \u201dshort\u201d years ago, during my sophomore year at The City College of New York, some fellow Caribbean classmates told me that the education department was offering a \u201dfree\u201d course, called Thinking Chess, for three credits. As an international student from Barbados, paying almost four times more in tuition than locals, the idea of getting \u201dfree\u201d credits in a system where we had to pay for everything was nothing short of a miracle.",
        "For hundreds of years, Timbuktu has had a place in the world\u2019s imagination. Located on the southern edge of the Sahara desert, the city flourished as a center of Islamic culture and scholarship in the 13th through 16th centuries. It was placed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1988, recognized for the University of Sankore, which had as many as 25, 000 students who studied the Quran, as well as the historic Djingareyber and Sidi Yahia mosques. Timbuktu was a center of the manuscript trade, with traders bringing Islamic texts from all over the Muslim world.",
        "When it comes to Shakespeare\u2019s legacy, it seems safe to conclude that \u201dwhat\u2019s past is prologue.\u201d Today marks 400 years since the day Shakespeare died, and people are celebrating his life and work around the world. April 23 is also believed to be the Bard\u2019s birthday. As you might expect, the biggest events honoring Shakespeare are taking place in the U. K. The Globe Theatre, a replica of the theater Shakespeare once partially owned, has organized an interactive event called \u201dThe Complete Walk.\u201d The 2.",
        "Editor\u2019s note: This week, to mark the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare\u2019s death, we will be running a series of stories examining the links between food and the Bard. In Shakespeare\u2019s time, England was a hungry and volatile nation. Cycles of endless, torrential rain repeatedly wiped out crops and drove up food prices. Both bread and ale demanded increasingly expensive wheat and barley. And some tried to make a quick shilling off the catastrophe by hoarding grain and holding it back from the open market \u2014 thus hiking up food bills even further. The result?",
        "April 23 is a big day in England: It\u2019s St. George\u2019s Day, a national holiday named for the country\u2019s patron saint, and it\u2019s also the day William Shakespeare is said to have been born and died. This April 23 marks the 400th anniversary of his death. According to the Royal Shakespeare Company\u2019s artistic director, Gregory Doran, the only account of Shakespeare\u2019s death was written 40 years after it happened, by the vicar of the church where he\u2019s buried.",
        "As a Latina who married into a Jewish family, I\u2019ve long lobbied my to include beans and rice on the Passover menu. The holiday is a time when Jews avoid leavened foods in commemoration of their biblical exodus from Egypt \u2014 when they had to flee so fast, they couldn\u2019t even let the bread rise. But beans and rice aren\u2019t leavened, I\u2019ve argued, so why not include them in the Seder meal? The answer I\u2019ve long gotten from my : tradition. You see, like many American Jews, my is of European ancestry, or Ashkenazi.",
        "Wearing a black coat and holding a cane in his right hand, Movses Haneshyan stands in front of a canvas. He stares at a winding road, a fir tree, distant mountains and a deep blue sky. He approaches the image slowly, and begins to cry, \u201dMy home. My Armenia.\u201d Haneshyan says he last saw his home a century ago. As a he was forced to flee during what Armenians call Medz Yeghern, the \u201dGreat Crime\u201d of 1915 \u2014 the systematic murder by Ottoman Turks of Armenian people in their historic homeland, which now lies in Turkey.",
        "Wine retailer David Trone is pouring $12. 4 million of his own money into his campaign for a Maryland congressional district \u2014 the most ever from a House candidate. Ahead of the Democratic primary on Tuesday for this suburban Washington, D. C. seat, his decision to entirely his race with such an exorbitant investment is fueling a debate over money in politics and whether bankrolling your campaign \u2014 much like a certain GOP presidential has done \u2014 is a positive or a negative. A Risky, Expensive Investment, Trone founded the Total Wine More superstores.",
        "The Hackensaw Boys are back. The   string band has made its own brand of music since 1999, after getting together in Charlottesville, Va.  \u2014   and though its lineup has changed and its sound mellowed, the group is still going strong.

        "Early morning light filters into the cavernous gymnasium as Neetu lunges, climbs and contorts her body into impossible positions. She shimmies up a thick rope that dangles from the ceiling, her heavily muscled arms propelling her upward. She races through calisthenics with 25 other young women in the boot camp atmosphere of Chhotu Ram Stadium and Wrestling Center, in the Indian state of Haryana, known for its wrestling tradition. The grueling practice \u2014 4 hours in the morning and 3 in the afternoon \u2014 is her ordinary routine."
