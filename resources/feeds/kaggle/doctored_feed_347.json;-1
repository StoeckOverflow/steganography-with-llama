        "Shortly before 6 p. m. on Monday, a bomb went off on a bus in Jerusalem, triggering bad memories for many Israelis. This type of attack had not happened in ten years. Blocks away from the bus, people paced the sidewalks, typing on cellphones or watching the small area for flashes of information about what occurred. They saw black lines twist into the sky and hear ongoing sirens as medics, police and firefighters raced to the scene. Three were injured in the explosion, including a Palestinian man, Abdel Hamid al Srour.",
        "If a financial disaster struck \u2014 say, a banking problem or a car that need repair \u2014 would you be able to come up with $ 400?

        "Shakespeare has always been there for me when I needed him. Acting really helped me survive depression. Writing about Shakespeare gets me through university. When I was in love, when I fell at love, when I lost a life I needed, Shakespeare was there with the last words, and still is.
