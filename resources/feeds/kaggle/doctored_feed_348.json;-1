        "While voters went to the polls in five states Tuesday, electoral problems in a different context were on the Supreme Court \u2019 s mind too. The Court has long held that the court cannot generally punish employees for exercising their constitutional right to free speech.

The skull found in Argentina is just the latest in a series of discoveries teaching scientists about how sauropods were once so successful as a group. If there ever was a \u201dnice\u201d dinosaur, it would be the sauropod. In dinosaur movies, they\u2019re the giants with impossibly long necks and big, cowlike eyes. There were legions of sauropod species. They were hardy survivors, outlasting numerous other dinosaurs that went extinct.",
