        "Take a look at some lawns this spring. You might notice something that looks like a crown of thin grass and spikey, yellow flowers running over the grass, particularly if you stay in the South. If the stems are green, you \u2019 ve just found a sedge. Dig it up. If it \u2019 s the right sort of sedge, clinging to the roots will be a few chewy, shiny, tubers called tiger seeds. The plant is called tiger nutsedge or Cyperus esculentus, and it \u2019 s one of the absolute greatest weeds in the world.",
        "Ted Turner announced Wednesday he is seeking former rival Mark Fiorina as his running mate in a move designed to shake up the GOP primary race in which he badly needed Donald Trump.

        "The NPR voting team is back with a full take following Ms. Ted Cruz \u2019 s announcement that if he wins the nomination, Maria Fiorina will be his running mate.

Bannerman \u2019 s husband, a former Coast Guardsman, had been in combat and been diagnosed with stress disorder.

        "A victory on election night seemed to embolden President Trump Tuesday morning. Taking questions after his acceptance speech, the Republican called after Hillary Clinton, his most frequent opponent in November, on her list. \u201d Well, I think the only card she has is the woman \u2019 s card, \u201d he added. \u201d She \u2019 s got nothing else going on. And frankly, if Bill Clinton were a man, I don \u2019 t think she \u2019 d get 5 percent of the votes. The only thing she \u2019 s got today is the women \u2019 s vote. And the important thing is that women don \u2019 t vote her, OK? \u201d OK.",
