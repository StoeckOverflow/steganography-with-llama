        "I could stop by Peter Frampton on the street and not hear him. His long blond hair, which shines like a halo on his album Frampton Comes Alive! may be dead, but as soon as he sat behind the Tiny Desk and began composing, 1976 came rushing back. I worked in a record store the year Frampton Comes Alive! came out, and it was one of those records that seemed to have universal importance.",
        "The hospital in Damascus, Syria, is the latest tertiary care facility to get blown apart. The building was tucked into the lower storey of a building in the Sukkari neighborhood of Aleppo. Sandbags blocked the windows and obscured the entrance. Concrete apartment blocks pressed on either side of it. Late Wednesday evening, witnesses say, a Russian jet unleashed a missile that smashed directly into the hospital. The airstrike injured at least 27 people, including Dr. Mohammed Wassim Moaz, a pediatrician who came to work in Aleppo even as the Syrian civil war raged around him.",
        "As summer progresses, anxiety about Zika is growing in Atlantic Coast states like Florida and Texas. The problem hasn \u2019 t spread to mosquitoes in the region, and it might not, but experts are preparing treatments. And because Zika can cause birth defects in newborns, many women \u2014 and their newborn \u2014 are nervous.

        "It \u2019 s been a good year for employees of Chobani. They learned that they could eventually own about 10 percent of the fast expanding Greek yogurt market. That could potentially make millionaires of some workers, if the privately owned company is sold or went public. It \u2019 s a grand decision, and reflects a rising growth in employee ownership. Chobani \u2019 s meteoric career began in a defunct American Kraft yogurt manufacturing plant in upstate New York. Founder Hamdi Ulukaya \u2019 s only achievement in the dairy business was that his father made delicious quality yogurt in his hometown in Turkey.",
        "With Monty Python as the exception that proves the rule, the big screen has been historically unkind to sketch comedy teams hoping their offbeat sensibility will survive the leap from bits to features \u2014 and from cult fervor to mainstream success. Some fail outright, like Mr. Show\u2019s Run Ronnie Run or The Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy, while others are embraced by fans after tanking, like The Lonely Island\u2019s Hot Rod or The State\u2019s Wet Hot American Summer.",

When he talks about encryption, he invokes the imagery of a whisper \u2014 this idea that you should be able to the most private means of physical communication in the digital world as well.",

        "Lately, it\u2019s been a political guessing game of which Donald Trump is going to show up. In the past 24 hours alone, the whiplash between what Ben Carson called the \u201dtwo different Donald Trumps\u201d was on bold display. From a serious foreign policy address in the morning, he returned just hours later to his regular slapstick mockery of his rivals.
