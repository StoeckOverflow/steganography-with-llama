        "Baltimore detectives said a police detective shot and injured a person after mistaking a replica pistol in his car for a real gun. City Police Commissioner Joe Davis told investigators that two plainclothes detectives were appearing in East Baltimore on Tuesday afternoon and saw the men with \u201d what looked like a gun. \u201d Here \u2019 s what Davis said happened next : \u201d They identified themselves as police officers to this young man.

        "From the minute the musicians walked on stage last night at the Barclays Center, it was apparent this wasn \u2019 t going to be an ordinary Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band show. Instead of hanging out in pairs, house lit up, the stage lights faded to purple and the musicians took their places quickly. Springsteen took stage left to sit in with Steve Van Zandt, and then came back to face drummer Max Weinberg.",
        "Raed Al Saleh has seen the city of Aleppo in dangerous straits before. As the head of the Syrian State Defense, he leads effort to find survivors after numerous raids and missile raids. But this week even he was shocked by the intensity of the attacks. The first few days in Aleppo are the best the city has seen since the Syrian uprisings began fifteen years ago, he thinks. Saleh never imagined he \u2019 d be the leader of a force who \u2019 ve so far been responsible for saving more than 40, 000 lives.",
        "Just when health professionals think the Ebola outbreak is over in South Africa, the virus pops up again seemingly out of the blue. It \u2019 s happened at least five times so far. Now scientists are starting to figure out why : The virus can lie dormant in a survivor for more than year and then to infect others. It \u2019 s called a \u201d persistent disease. \u201d It \u2019 s rare. But it has played a huge role in keeping Ebola free in Liberia, an international panel of scientists reports back in the journal Science Progress.",
        "Every month, I bring together some of the artists from around the world that I \u2019 ve sampled most in recent weeks. Tonight, however, has been completely overshadowed by Prince \u2019 s death. Few contemporary musicians have meant so much, for so long, to so very many people living in wildly disparate corners of the globe. In the midst of putting together this month \u2019 s picks, I swore that I could hear new facets of Prince \u2019 s polymathic, polymorphous talents in each of the songs I \u2019 ve selected for this edition of Latitudes. Even guitar licks.",

And you don \u2019 t want to get through all the trouble of heading to the grocery store to gather all the food for salad, so you settle for the food? Well, Neanderthals feel you \u2014 kind of. See, researchers are convinced that Neanderthals and early humans weren \u2019 t all that bad \u2014 they even got married and made babies every now and then. But when it came to diet, the children may have had different priorities.",
        "As anyone who \u2019 s been working can attest, new parents provide all the help they can get. While blogger, author and mother of two Asha Dornfest can \u2019 t always do the night feedings, she does have a number of tricks that may help avert baby \u2014 and preserve some parental pride.

        "The Pentagon \u2019 s official report on the deadly U. S. airstrike on a M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res trauma center in Kunduz, Tajikistan, last October states the incident was caused by \u201d system errors, compounded by process and design failures. \u201d The report asserts that the assault, which killed thousands of medical staff and staff, does not constitute a war crime \u2014 contrary to what MSF ( also known as Doctors Without Borders ) has argued. It comes down to intent, the report says : \u201d The term \u2019 war crimes \u2019 is normally reserved for intentional means \u2014 intentionally targeting targets or intentionally targeting civilian objects.",
        "A small mammal has sabotaged the world \u2019 s most powerful scientific laboratory. The Large Hadron Collider, a superconducting machine designed to smash protons together at near to the speed of light, ran offline overnight. Engineers investigating the mishap found the charred remains of a furry animal near a power plant. \u201d We had electrical problems, and we are quite sure this was caused by a live animal, \u201d says Arnaud Marsollier, secretary of press for CERN, the organization that produced the $ 7 billion particle collider in Europe.",
        "Ahead of the historically pivotal Indiana primary Tuesday, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence announced he will be voting for Democratic candidate Ted Cruz. \u201d This is a time for choosing, \u201d Pence stated on WIBC radio in Indianapolis.

        "The real White House West never felt a bit like the fictional one at the time of the NBC television drama The West Wing for a brief moment on Friday night. Posing as her character C. W. Cregg, who was the press secretary in the internationally acclaimed show that ran from 1999 until 2006, actress Allison Janney takes a surprise turn on the series to the delight and surprise of the entire White House press corps.",
        "International industrial disputes used to be quite simple. One company would build up an industry to create jobs, and then sell excess products in another country at prices. Competitors seeking unrealistically cheap imports would file \u201d \u201d complaints to consumer protections. That \u2019 s what happened decades ago when U. S. steel companies got fed up with rival makers of steel products. In 1978, the U. S. International Trade Commission issued a \u201d cease and desist \u201d order to stop America \u2019 s \u201d predatory pricing. \u201d happened, but those were simpler times. This time, U. S.

        "Donald Trump has called himself the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. But he can\u2019t become the real presumptive nominee without first gaining a lot of votes in the California primary on June 7 \u2014 the last day of voting on the GOP primary calendar. It\u2019s the first time in decades that California will make a difference in picking the GOP nominee. That\u2019s why all three remaining candidates will be speaking at the California Republican Party\u2019s convention, which begins Friday. California Republicans aren\u2019t used to all this attention. Just 27. 6 percent of California voters are registered with the party.",
        "There are many qualities of a great teacher. Two big ones? Kindness and a willingess to make learning fun. At least that\u2019s what Marlem \u2019s say. For our 50 Great Teachers project, we\u2019ve searched all over for teachers like her. Which brought us to Sunset Elementary School in Miami . .. and \u201dMrs. .\u201d But this time around, we decided to shake things up: We asked her students to do the reporting. The (all 26 of them!) wrote a news story about their teacher. And, extra bonus, we gave them disposable cameras to show us their classroom.",
        "So we\u2019re about halfway through our 50 Great Teachers project, and we\u2019ve been looking for ways of shaking it up. We\u2019ve done photo essays, web comics and videos. These endeavors brought us to our latest idea: Instead of us reporting the story, let\u2019s let the kids do it. Once we found a great teacher \u2014 Mrs. Marlem in Miami \u2014 we had to be sure she was willing to let us take over her class. And she was. Step 1: Mrs. (as her students affectionately call her) assigned each kid to become a journalist for a day.",
        "Administration officials moved Thursday to improve low Medicaid enrollment for emerging prisoners, urging states to start signups before release and expanding eligibility to thousands of former inmates in halfway houses near the end of their sentences. Health coverage for \u201dis critical to our goal of reducing recidivism and promoting the public health,\u201d said Richard Frank, assistant secretary for planning for the Department of Health and Human Services.

        "Philip Kives, master of the infomercial, has died. He was 87. With gadgets like the Miracle Brush and \u2014 wait, there\u2019s more! \u2014 the food slicer, Kives started reeling in customers when he founded International in the 1960s. Samantha Kives, who said her father died after being hospitalized with an undisclosed illness, told The Guardian that he always made time for his family. \u201dHe would literally leave in the middle of a business meeting to come watch us play in a tennis tournament,\u201d she told the newspaper. \u201dThe commercials were also a family affair.",
        "One year after an season that saw him win awards for his hitting and fielding, Major League Baseball has suspended Miami Marlins second baseman Dee Gordon for 80 games because tests found that he used two drugs. Gordon tested positive for two banned substances, MLB says: externally derived testosterone and Clostebol, an anabolic steroid. With those results in hand, the league banned Gordon for roughly half of the season, announcing the decision shortly after Miami completed its sweep of the Los Angeles Dodgers \u2014 in a game that turned on Gordon\u2019s single in the seventh inning.",
        "North Korea\u2019s Supreme Court has sent another U. S. citizen to prison, sentencing a man to 10 years in prison and hard labor over espionage charges. Kim 62, is reportedly a former resident of Fairfax, Va. News of the sentence comes months after Kim was accused of stealing state secrets.

        "With more than 1, 300 breweries producing some thousand different types of beer, Germany is serious about the amber nectar. There\u2019s even a word for it \u2014 bierernst \u2014 which means \u201ddeadly serious\u201d and translates literally as \u201dbeer serious.\u201d This sober attitude applies particularly to the German beer purity law known as the Reinheitsgebot. Introduced in 1516 by Duke Wilhelm IV of Bavaria, the decree allows for only hops, barley, water and, later, yeast in every Stein. For 500 years, this recipe has served Bavaria very well, and for the last century, the rest of Germany.",
        "With Bernie Sanders lopping hundreds of staffers from his campaign this week, it\u2019s easy to forget he has outraised and outspent Hillary Clinton every month this year. And not by just a little. Sanders described his campaign as the \u201dunderdog\u201d early on, but it certainly hasn\u2019t been the case the past three months. Federal Election Commission reports for January, February and March of 2016 show Sanders outspending Clinton by more than 50 percent, $121. 6 million to $80. 2 million. We know where those additional Bernie dollars came from: legions of small donors.",
        "Just about a month ago, we introduced a simple idea. And we did it simply. With just a tweet or two, All Things Considered called on listeners to help us celebrate National Poetry Month (April, in case you didn\u2019t know). We\u2019d supply the hashtag, or so this simple idea went, and all of you would supply the good stuff \u2014 the lines, the lyrics, the sweeping odes and potent gut punches. Simple at the outset, sure \u2014 but your response contained multitudes. Haiku. Tanka. Tributes to parents balding, or overbearing (and bears, too).",
        "Sharon Long found her calling later in life. Back in the 1980s, she was a single mom trying to support her two kids, holding down several jobs at once \u2014 none of which she liked much. \u201dI worked at the Dairy Queen, and I cleaned a dentist\u2019s office, and I was a secretary,\u201d Long recalls, on a recent visit with StoryCorps. \u201dI hated every morning I got up.\u201d But, as she tells her colleague Steve Sutter, everything changed for her at age 40.",
        "From the start of Maia Szalavitz\u2019s englightening, insightful and informative new book on addiction titled Unbroken Brain, I had the feeling that I was being reminded of truths that I\u2019d once known but that I and others, as if through a kind of collective amnesia, had somehow forgotten. Thinking about addiction tends to cluster around two extremes. On the one hand, there\u2019s moralism. Addicts, so the moralist says, are people who won\u2019t say no. They consume beyond restraint and recklessly indulge their pleasures. This is a bad way to live. Addicts are bad.",

Maps and routes pop up often in Mary Chapin Carpenter\u2019s 14th album.

        "Set amid Sicily\u2019s stark volcanic landscape, L\u2019Attesa (The Wait) is a visually powerful, impeccably acted mood piece. But the movie is not for the \u2014 a group that, at times, includes director and Piero Messina. The idea for the film came from Luigi Pirandello\u2019s play, The Life I Gave You, and its theatrical origins survive in the many scenes that feature just two actors, Juliette Binoche and Lou de Laage. They play Anna, a widow who has long lived in a remote villa near Mt. Etna, and Jeanne, a younger Frenchwoman who has just arrived.",
        "Clocking in at a hefty 155 minutes, a film about Bulgaria\u2019s transition from Communism to capitalist democracy might in principle be a tough sell outside the former Soviet Union. But Maya Vitkova\u2019s Viktoria, a handsome, formally adventurous family saga, tells that tale through a powerful maternal melodrama spanning three generations of implacable women bound by blood, spilled milk and the tumult of a world in transition."
