        "The premise and theme of The Family Fang feature a dynasty of twee eccentrics with maladjusted children, either the Tenenbaums, or the Bluths of Arrested Development. But though the Fangs portray the latter \u2019 s Jason Bateman, here directing as well as once more playing the role, this is a different failed plot, and they strike a different blow onscreen : one more principled and intimate than mannered or intelligent. They \u2019 re a clan of performance stars whose public spectacles puncture the very idea of how families are supposed to play, now reckoning with the consequences of such a craft.",
        "President Obama has slashed defense costs and will leave his successor with a smaller military force \u2014 or so two presidential candidates, led by Donald Trump, instead. THE CLAIM : \u201d Our military is depleted, \u201d Obama said in his address on defense, \u201d and we \u2019 re asking our generals and government leaders to worry about global warming. \u201d In the past, Romney has claimed the U. S. Navy under Obama has become \u201d a nightmare, \u201d and other Republicans have described it as \u201d gutted \u201d since Obama took power. THE SHORT ANSWER : It \u2019 s complicated.",
        "One photo of a pensive Congolese woman in her distinctive costume could be mistaken for a Chinese painting. Another, of a water plant sending fiery plumes over a town in China, appears like a still from a 1950s propaganda film. And another, of a teenage girl yawning during an Indonesian dinner, will just make you smile. The images from the ninth annual International World Photography Festival, the largest photo conference in the world, come in numerous styles and flavors. More than 230, 000 photos, taken from the past 12 months, were taken by photographers in 186 countries.",
        "\u201d It could have spelled the end for us. \u201d Greg Lifeson is on the phone, calling from his Toronto home, thinking back to the time between Rush \u2019 s third and fourth albums in the months of 1975 and 1976. It \u2019 s difficult to believe now, some four albums sold quickly, but the Canadian rock world was at a crossroads then. After a pair of decently received albums, 1974 \u2019 s Rush and 1975 \u2019 s Fly By Night, Caress of Steel floundered both commercially and commercially.",
        "This story is part of NPR \u2019 s podcast Embedded, which digs deeply into the stories behind the crimes. Inside a Newton Jackson, Ga. room, Shawn appears before a judge ready to make a guilty plea. A week earlier, police had arrested him with 4 ounces of marijuana, two food scales and plastic baggies at his mobile home near Boston. His lawyer negotiated the terms to avoid the sentence Shawn could face if his brother went to trial. During the 2012 trial, the judge fired off 47 rounds to Shawn in quick succession. No.",
        "We all love our family. But depending on how you show that picture, you may be doing more harm than good, according to one scientist. Dr. Stanley Coren, a professor emeritus in psychology at the University of British Columbia, found in a Psychology Today research post that hugging a dog actually increases the child \u2019 s stress level. For his research, Coren looked at a random collection of 250 pictures of people holding dogs from Google Product Search and Flickr.",
        "To burn or not to sell? That is the question facing African countries in their fight against the illegal ivory trade. Tanzania, which introduced the world to modern ivory in 1989, still think it \u2019 s a good idea. On Sunday morning, it hosted the most memorable burn event ever : The tusks of nearly 7, 000 elephants \u2014 105 million tons \u2019 worth \u2014 were set alight in 11 separate pyres in Nairobi \u2019 s Forest Park. The tusks, taken from elephants that were poached as well as from those that died immediately, were collected from Kenya \u2019 s territory and confiscated at its ports.",
        "After a victory on election night, Donald Trump took time during a QA with CNN to take a jab at Hillary Clinton. \u201d Well, I think the only card she has is the woman \u2019 s card, \u201d he added. \u201d She \u2019 s got nothing big going on. And frankly, if Bill Clinton were a man, I don \u2019 t think she \u2019 d get 5 percent of the votes. The only thing she \u2019 s got today is the women \u2019 s vote. And the important thing is that women don \u2019 t need her, OK? \u201d Those comments, not enough, caused some online speculation, a lot of jokes, and various think pieces.",
        "Donald Trump \u2019 s dominance over the Republican candidate field has come as a surprise to the political world. But followers of professional wrestling might be less surprised that Trump has managed to knock more than a dozen Republican candidates out of the races. Trump \u2019 s stint in the professional wrestling world dated back to 2007 when NBC listened to Trump \u2019 s show, The Apprentice, on its other network. He appeared on Wrestlemania XXIII in what was billed as the Hair vs. Hair bout and the Battle of the Billionaires against Vince McMahon, the CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment.",
        "When I meet the unnamed ISIS fighter, he doesn \u2019 t look quite like the bombastic murderers in the propaganda photos. Ahmed Darwish, 29, is slight, panting and shuffling in orange plastic sandals, wincing in pain as he walks into a police car in Rumeilan, northern Syria, guarded by the Kurdish fighters who found him running away after a struggle. His arms are bandaged and head is shaved : he was struck in a coalition airstrike in front of the forces. It can be hard to tell why young Muslims fear ISIS.",
        "It \u2019 s a ( if ) idea that somehow makes people more sophisticated. But a new report added a twist to this : the most educated students have grown increasingly affluent over the last couple of decades. A report from the Pew Research Center finds a wide achievement gap between highly qualified and Americans. Not only that, but the share of young grads and who are \u201d consistently liberal \u201d ( based on their answers to a series of scientific questions ) has grown substantially in the last 20 years.",
        "Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for teenagers in the United States, and alcohol is involved in 1 out of 4 of those crashes. The stronger a county \u2019 s restrictions on alcohol sales, the lower the teen death toll, a study found. Policies aimed at the general public were more effective than those targeting teenagers, the study found. They include regulations that limit the amount alcohol can be sold and the number of alcohol outlets in a certain area, as well as restrictions on alcohol sales.",
        "The nation\u2019s top law enforcement officer walked past a fence, through passages lined with walls, to meet with a special audience. But this was not a normal \u2014 a FBI security detail tracked her every move. Inside the visitation room in this federal correctional institution, five men in khaki uniforms and black Crocs slippers were waiting to give Attorney General Loretta Lynch a glimpse of their struggles. \u201dJust because we\u2019re locked up doesn\u2019t make us bad people,\u201d says Tony Moses, 47, a tall man who\u2019s locked up until January 2041 on armed robbery charges.",
        "In the field of addiction treatment, already brimming with intensely personal and emotional debates, there may be nothing more controversial than the role of programs, which are based on Alcoholics Anonymous. At least 80 percent of current American addiction treatment \u2014 for both alcohol and other drugs \u2014 is based on teaching patients the ideology of the steps and persuading them to become members and attend meetings for the rest of their lives. Without question, many people believe strongly that AA and similar programs have saved their lives.",
        "If the annual White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner is \u201dnerd prom,\u201d Mr. President is the class clown. In his final run as comedian in chief at the event on Saturday evening, President Obama closed his speech with \u201dObama out\u201d and a mic drop before receiving a standing ovation from Washington and Hollywood bigwigs. That\u2019s right, Obama pulled a Kobe Bryant in a nod to his own retirement from correspondents\u2019 dinners and, soon, the White House. In his roasting session, the president united celebrities, journalists, politicos and his potential successors by taking them down.",
        "The White House Correspondent\u2019s complex has grown exponentially over time. Besides the dinner itself, the most annual social event in Washington, D. C. there are days of \u201dnerd prom\u201d events planned throughout the District \u2014 before and after the main event. All the parties hosted the week of, by the likes of Tinder and Google. The brunches on Saturday. The on Saturday evening. The watch parties for those who can\u2019t get in. The after parties Saturday night all around the city. The \u201dhangover brunches\u201d on Sunday.",
        "The Kansas Supreme Court gave state lawmakers an ultimatum: Make school funding more equitable by June 30, or it will consider shutting down the state\u2019s public schools. Since then, things have gotten ugly. Lawmakers followed up with a plan \u2014 to make it easier to impeach Supreme Court judges who attempt to \u201dusurp the power\u201d of the Legislature or governor. Then came a plan to address the court\u2019s concerns over school funding: Send a little more money to roughly of the state\u2019s poorest districts without taking money away from other districts or raising taxes.",
        "The Rev. Daniel Berrigan, a Jesuit priest who became emblematic of the movement opposing U. S. involvement in Vietnam after an audacious act of civil disobedience, died on Saturday. The Jesuit magazine, America, reports that he died at age 94 at the Jesuit Community in the Bronx, New York. Berrigan was an acclaimed poet but he came to national prominence when he and eight others stole hundreds of draft records from the Selective Service Offices in Catonsville, Maryland. They walked outside and set the documents on fire using homemade napalm. Berrigan was taken to jail.",
        "Last week, NPR published a special report on suicide in Native Arctic communities. Reporter Rebecca Hersher spent 10 weeks in Greenland, the Arctic country with the highest known suicide rate in the world: 82. 8 suicides per 100, 000 people each year \u2014 six times higher than the U. S. suicide rate. She interviewed Inuit people in the Greenlandic capital, Nuuk, and in small towns on the country\u2019s remote east coast. She spoke with community leaders and mental health professionals who are trying to prevent suicide and come to terms with its underlying causes.",
        "The way Jimmy Santiago Baca tells it, poetry saved his life \u2014 but he\u2019s not speaking in hyperbole. Long before the poet won an American Book Award, Baca was in prison on a drug conviction, where he was facing down a fight with another inmate. Baca sought padding however he could get it.",
        "From Mexico City\u2019s Z\u00f3calo to Rome\u2019s Piazza Navona, public squares have always been a vibrant part of urban life. After visiting Italy a few years back, editor Catie Marron began thinking about the different roles these public spaces have played. She asked some writers to share their thoughts about famous squares around the world, and the resulting essays are gathered in a new book called City Squares. Michael Kimmelman, one of the participating writers, says what\u2019s important about a square is that it acts like a magnet, drawing people in.",
        "Ricky Gervais always seems to be working on something new. Whether it\u2019s producing a TV show, writing a movie, voicing a cartoon character, or hosting the Golden Globes, the comedian keeps busy. The is in the new film Special Correspondents, which he wrote and directed, now streaming on Netflix. The movie follows two radio journalists, played by Eric Bana and Gervais, who are assigned to Ecuador to report on a war. But Gervais\u2019 character throws away their passports and money by accident.",
        "Editor\u2019s note: This piece originally identified Beaulieu as the illustrator in fact, he\u2019s the colorist and Skottie Young both wrote and penciled. You don\u2019t have to know about Princess Syndrome to get a huge, howling kick out of I Hate Fairyland, Skottie Young\u2019s new comic. But then, you probably do know about Princess Syndrome. Ever since 2006, when New York Times writer Peggy Orenstein described her preschooler\u2019s bewitchment with tulle skirts and tiaras, people with similarly inclined daughters have been having a bit of a meltdown.",
        "Cyndi Lauper, that girl power icon of the eighties, has a new album. Her latest collection of songs takes a distinctly southern turn: It\u2019s an album of classic country covers. \u201dTo me it\u2019s like the roots of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll,\u201d Lauper says, \u201dbecause it\u2019s around the time period when rhythm and blues and country were very linked, just around the time Elvis kicked the doors down.\u201d The new record is called Detour, and Lauper joined NPR\u2019s Rachel Martin in the studio to explain why she took the turn.",
        "Maybe there really was a time when America was more innocent. Back when May Basket Day was a thing, perhaps. The curious custom \u2014 still practiced in discrete pockets of the country \u2014 went something like this: As the month of April rolled to an end, people would begin gathering flowers and candies and other goodies to put in May baskets to hang on the doors of friends, neighbors and loved ones on May 1. In some communities, hanging a May basket on someone\u2019s door was a chance to express romantic interest.",
        "33 lions have been rescued from circuses in South America and airlifted to a wildlife sanctuary in South Africa. The group that organized the operation, Animal Defenders International, is calling it the \u201dlargest airlift of lions in history,\u201d The Associated Press reports. The animals were rescued from circuses in Colombia and Peru after both countries passed new laws to ban the use of wild animals in circuses, according to ADI. The group says 24 of the lions were rescued during surprise raids on Peruvian circuses, while nine were \u201dvoluntarily surrendered\u201d by a Colombian circus.",
        "Populism is one of the most important forces in American politics today. Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump have both tapped into widespread frustrations against the elites and the establishment. It\u2019s not hard to see where the rage at a rigged system comes from. Washington is gridlocked, the economy isn\u2019t growing fast enough and what growth there is hasn\u2019t been shared equally. Too many people feel left behind.",
        "Ted Cruz has taken pictures with his vice presidential pick, their arms raised in the iconic V for victory pose. Bernie Sanders has talked about his platform, and John Kasich held a news conference to review plans for upcoming primaries and the convention in Cleveland. What\u2019s going on here? Don\u2019t these guys know they\u2019re losing? Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are nearing the numbers of delegates each needs for a victory at their respective conventions. Indiana\u2019s primary this week could make this all but inevitable.",
        "Philadelphia\u2019s historic Italian Market is known for its cheeses, meats, fresh pastas and chocolate. Running 10 city blocks through south Philadelphia, it\u2019s one of the oldest and largest markets in the country. But what would a tour through this vibrant neighborhood be like without the ability to see? That\u2019s where Philly Touch Tours comes in. The guide company specializes in offering tours of Philadelphia. On a recent Tuesday afternoon, tour guide Andy Maunder stops everyone at a street corner to set the scene for the group. Their first stop is Superior Pasta, which sells the freshly made stuff.",
        "In what\u2019s being hailed as a \u201dmiracle\u201d and the \u201dbest story in sports,\u201d Leicester City, a small club from central England that started the season at odds of winning the prestigious English Premier League title, has clinched the trophy. On Monday, with two games still left in the season, the Foxes secured their place in history when second place Tottenham failed to beat Chelsea. It\u2019s the first title for Leicester in the club\u2019s history. The club is only the sixth since 1992 to win the title."
