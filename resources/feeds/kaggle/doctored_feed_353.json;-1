        "At some hospitals, maps on the wall in the emergency department list the drugs that are in long supply or unavailable, along with recommended alternatives. The medical aid can save people with critically ill patients, allowing doctors to concentrate on caring for them rather than doing anything on the fly, said Prof. Jesse Pines, a professor of internal medicine and director of the Institute for Clinical Practice Innovation at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences. He has studied the risks created by shortages. The need for such workarounds probably won \u2019 t end anytime soon.",
        "The Zika virus has provoked a debate about abortion in both Latin America and the United Kingdom. The virus has been directly attributed to a birth defect that results in an abnormally small head and nerve damage. In Latin America, where many countries have implemented bans on abortion, some citizens and public officials are asking whether such bans should be reconsidered, at least in infected countries. And in the United States, a concern has been reignited : Should the country rethink its stance on new abortion initiatives abroad, put forth in what \u2019 s known as the Helms Amendment?",
        "Matt Coy used to tell people how he passed 47 years without success. Not once. Not even for high school class president. But there he was every Friday at an center at a city parks building in Jackson, Ind. excitedly preparing to file his ballot for Republican Donald Trump. \u201d I \u2019 ve lost seven factory jobs in the past 10 years, to go to Mexico or go to Mexico or maybe to somewhere out of the country. We \u2019 re leaving our jobs to everybody else. We need \u2019 em back. I think he can do it, \u201d Coy said.",
        "One of the biggest legacies President Obama intends to leave behind is an index of U. S. exports. To do that, he needs to complete one large deal with European governments, and another with Pacific Rim countries. But well into his final weeks in office, Obama is taking stiff headwinds on trade. The final deal, called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, became news on Monday... but still not the way the White House would have preferred. Greenpeace America, an environmental group, released 248 pages of classified data involving TTIP, the deal involving the U. S. and European governments.",
        "The food glitterati will celebrate in Chicago Monday night for the James Beard Wine and Restaurant Awards, named as the \u201d Oscars of the food world. \u201d Most of the categories sound like Broadway fare : Outstanding Set Design. Best restaurant : Great Lakes. Best New Restaurant. Five Star Chef of the year. There \u2019 s not much of interest for anything outside the foodies and food business orbit. Except, that is, for a sneakily subversive movie : America \u2019 s Classics.",
        "Intel was once known for its success in branding desktop computers with microprocessors, a technology that survived the digital revolution. But the Silicon Valley veteran says last month it may lay off 11 percent of its jobs \u2014 up to 12, 000 positions \u2014 and that it \u2019 s shifting away from personal computing. MIT \u2019 s Audie Cornish talks to Michael Isaacson, author of The Innovators, about Intel \u2019 s rise amid the waning popularity of PCs and what would be next for the Silicon Valley titan.

        "When it comes to the development of China \u2019 s economy, Lin Dengwen is yesterday \u2019 s man. He comes from the countryside and found work a few years ago at Beijing \u2019 s Baosteel, smoothing the edges off steel sheets. After his first year, the Chinese market began to shrink and the company cut Tang \u2019 s monthly salary from $ 780 to about $ 620. A couple of months ago, Cheng, 34, took a second shift, earning $ 2. 25 an hour buying food for KFC. He was so beat after a short steel shift that he gave up a food order.",
        "A somber procession happened on Sunday in the courtyard of the La Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tenn. where Martin Luther King Jr. was killed in 1968. Everyone in Memphis knows about that piece of work, but until recently, folks were unaware of a massacre that happened in the same area of town 100 years ago. On May 1, 1866, Memphis was subjected to a massacre that left dozens of black folks killed and countless others missing.",
        "Aside from the Senate House race, there \u2019 s one important battle this week that shouldn \u2019 t be overlooked \u2014 the fight for control of the U. S. Senate. Democrats won back the majority just five years ago after four years in the political spotlight. But they could just as easily use that newfound power, especially if a powerful GOP nominee like Donald Trump is at the top of the poll. Republicans believe that likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton could even damage some Democrats, however, with low approval ratings herself and the shadow of her email message still lingering.",
        "Donald Trump could solidify his position as the Democratic Party \u2019 s nominee with a vote in Indiana Tuesday. Ted Cruz is hoping an intervention from Indiana Gov.

        "A trio of recently discovered planets seem ideally suited to search for planets that these alien worlds might be able to support anyway. The planets orbit close to an unusually small, dark star that \u2019 s about the size of our Earth and is far cooler, researchers report in the journal entry. All three planets have one side that \u2019 s always facing the star, and one side that \u2019 s always facing us. That means one side is frigid and one side is scorching cold \u2014 but the regions in between might be downright cozy.",
        "If the entire, important 2016 GOP presidential primary could be captured in one day, this might be it. While campaigning for his personal life in Indiana just ahead of their critical primary on Tuesday, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was shaking hands alongside Indiana Gov. Mike Pence when a very vocal supporter of Donald Trump interrupted. Chants of \u201d Do the math! Do the math! \u201d began in the background, while supporters of his try to create their own chorus of \u201d Cruz!",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign raised $26. 4 million last month, beating the campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders financially for the first time in 2016. Sanders has routinely outpaced Clinton in fundraising this year thanks to a dedicated base of small donors. But these latest numbers indicate a political pivot Clinton\u2019s fundraising is accelerating while Sanders\u2019 is slowing. The Sanders campaign, which released its fundraising numbers Sunday, raised about $25. 8 million in April, down dramatically from the $46 million he raised the month before. In total, the former secretary of state has raised about $213. 5 million.",

        "Though it\u2019s the world\u2019s top infectious killer, tuberculosis is surprisingly tricky to diagnose. Scientists think that video gamers can help them create a better diagnostic test. An online puzzle released Monday will see whether the researchers are right. Players of a game called EteRNA will try to design a sensor molecule that could potentially make diagnosing TB as easy as taking a home pregnancy test. The TB puzzle marks the launch of \u201dEteRNA Medicine.\u201d The idea of rallying gamers to fight TB arose as two young Stanford University professors chatted over dinner at a conference last May.",

        "When writers try to describe the music of the metamorphic torch singer Anohni, they reach for words like \u201dliminal\u201d and \u201dethereal,\u201d recognizing that its effect is enchanting, opening up new worlds of identity and consciousness. In The New Yorker, Hua Hsu recently compared her voice to Boy George, Nina Simone and \u201dwhat I imagine a radiant, healing crystal sounds like\u201d \u2014 which, setting aside the phrase\u2019s whiff of Age snobbery, is actually quite accurate.",

When her son, Hunter, was born two months premature, he was 2 pounds, 10 ounces and fighting for his life. Hunter was in the neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU, for more than a month. The \u201ddiet\u201d comes in because Glynn, a waitress, couldn\u2019t afford to buy meals in the hospital cafeteria.",
