        "The pace of jobs creation slowed significantly last month, the Employment Department said recently. Employers added 160, 000 employees in March, downshifting from the monthly average of 192, 000 jobs so far this year. That was a trend for many job seekers. But the economy does have one group enjoying lots of opportunities : freshly minted college graduates. In fact, economists say this may be the best time to be employed in a decade. While the overall graduation rate held steady at 5 percent last year, the Labor Department estimates the rate is only about half that for college graduates.",

        "A new science journal is not merely a major venue for publishing articles, it can encourage new discoveries, create a new community of investigators and, to some degree, contribute to the establishing of new organizations. There are numerous examples of this in the history of science. For example, computer science was not born in 1978 when Stevan Harnad created Behavioral and Brain Sciences, but there can be no question that BBS helped make computer science the sort of robustly organized it has become.",

It\u2019s a peevish teen that smells of Speed Stick and Clearasil and a practiced, performative surliness. It demands that you drop it off a block away from school. For the past eight years, I\u2019ve written a preview of the comics on offer on Free Comic Book Day for NPR.
