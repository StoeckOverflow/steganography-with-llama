        "In her suburban Chelsea row house, Margit Friedman, 94, sits wrapped in cloth in her favorite recliner. She was a girl of 17 when she first came to Britain, arriving from her native Prague just before the Nazis invaded. She remembers the arrival date : June 5, 1939. \u201d When I returned, [ Czechoslovakia ] was still a democratic country, \u201d she recalls. \u201d But we later became occupied by the Nazis. \u201d In the late 1930s, as Nazi persecution of Jews intensified, the Czechoslovak government and Jewish charity groups arranged for the migration of nearly 10, 000 children to the U.

        "Every July 9, Russian television broadcast is dominated by one of the country \u2019 s most important holidays, which refers to both the past and the present. The battle consists of tanks and other military vehicles rolling through Times Square as President Vladimir Putin and other dignitaries watch.

        "After voters in Beaumont, Texas, rejected a request for loosened regulations on cars, both Uber and Lyft have announced they will be \u201d pausing \u201d driving in the city. In late 2015, Houston \u2019 s City Council passed an ordinance requiring areas like Uber and Lyft to be regulated like taxis. That meant, among other changes, drivers would have to be fingerprinted as part of a background check. Uber and Lyft, in response, pushed a ballot measure asking voters to choose between that city ordinance and a looser local law.",
        "For years now, The Good Wife has been the best comedy series on broadcast TV, but it deserves even more criticism than that. From the start, show writers Robert and Michelle Taylor have had to deal with restrictive network guidelines, inconsistent scheduling, intrusive tax breaks and a production rate of 22 episodes per month \u2014 almost twice that of its cable and streaming competition. Yet, from start to finish, The Good Wife has been rewarding, surprising and delightfully successful. It became one of my favourite TV series to ever \u2014 and stayed that way until the end.",
        "Updated 6 : 10 a. m. ET Tuesday : With 87 percent of precincts counting, Rodrigo Duterte, the mayor of downtown Davao City, appears to have lost the Philippine presidential primary.

        "Turn on the TV and you can barely escape the full TPP. The Partnership is a free trade deal between the U. S. and 11 other countries that \u2019 s currently being negotiated. Conservative candidates on both sides of the debate are deriding the TPP, saying it \u2019 s a bum deal that will hurt the U. S. economy and especially workers. But if you venture into the South and ask a farmer about the TPP, you \u2019 re likely to get a different story.",
        "When President Clinton announced the details of the negotiations on Thursday \u2014 and released them on Amazon. com \u2014 there was a lot of talking about labor, the environment and trade. But trade deals have a way of changing the way we operate, too. Consider NAFTA, which boosted the availability of summer avocados and winter tomatoes for Americans, while stored and processed food in China. So now that we know the details of this whole Pacific Rim trade deals, what might it mean for us \u2014 both in the U. S.",
        "Hillary Clinton snagged another endorsement over the weekend, but don \u2019 t expect her to trumpet it on the campaign trail. \u201d I have a little announcement to make... I \u2019 m voting for Clinton. I am endorsing Hillary, \u201d noted campaign author P. R. O \u2019 Rourke said on Let \u2019 s Wait Wait... Don \u2019 t Leave Me. The episode aired over the internet. If the Clinton campaign wanted to tout O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s support as it ought to woo moderate Republicans who supported Jeb Bush and George W. Bush, it might work to end the quote there.",
        "There was the panel discussions on energy and climate at the EU Commission in February. There was the panel on counterterrorism at the U. N. in March. And then there was the panel on infrastructure at the World Bank in April : 15 scientists and one lone man, in a red blazer, serving as the moderator. Why are scientists so woefully underrepresented? That \u2019 s the big question behind the hashtag # allmalepanels. Since 2013, it \u2019 s has been tacked onto thousands of panel discussions at events and blasted out on social networks.",
        "Bernie Sanders won the West Virginia blanket primary on Tuesday over Hillary Clinton. The Vermont incumbent \u2019 s victory bolsters his decision to continue in the race even though the delegate math is shifting in Clinton \u2019 s favor. Sanders won Indiana last October and could win six other states slated to fall this month. \u201d West Virginia is a state, and like many other states in this country \u2014 especially Oregon \u2014 working areas are hurting.",
        "Miami resort is one of the nation \u2019 s six most vulnerable to climate change \u2014 and its leaders are doing something about it. The resort, a national leader in improving climate, has begun to fund improvements aimed at protecting residents from rising water levels. In South Carolina, the rate of rise has tripled over the last decade, according to a recent study from the University of Miami.

        "Could gender be a decisive factor in a matchup between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton? \u201dYou know, she\u2019s playing the woman\u2019s card,\u201d Trump told supporters at a rally in Spokane, Wash. over the weekend, reiterating a critique he has used against Clinton since becoming the de facto presidential nominee for the Republican Party. \u201dIf she didn\u2019t play the woman\u2019s card she would have no chance, I mean zero, of winning.\u201d But some experts see Trump\u2019s comments about women as a veiled warning for men.",
        "Hillary Clinton would have a significant electoral advantage over Donald Trump in the general election, based on an NPR analysis. The Democratic former secretary of state would start out with already exactly enough electoral votes to win the presidency, based on states considered safe, likely and to lean toward either candidate. The ratings, which will be updated at least monthly until Election Day, are based on fundamentals \u2014 historical trends and demographics, plus reporting and polling (both public and private).",

        "West Point has said that 16 black female cadets did not violate any Department of Defense or Army regulations by posing with their fists raised in a photo taken ahead of their graduation from the academy. No punitive action will be taken against the women after an inquiry found that their gesture was intended to demonstrate \u201dunity\u201d and \u201dpride,\u201d a statement from the institution said.

        "The Food and Drug Administration is its definition of what counts as a \u201dhealthy\u201d food. The change comes as healthful fats \u2014 including fats found in nuts \u2014 are increasingly recognized as part of a good diet. Currently, if a food company wants to put a \u201dhealthy\u201d claim on its label, regulations stipulate that it must be very low in fat. The specific rules are complex, but, for instance, a snack food can contain no more than 3 grams of fat for a serving. This means that many snacks that include nuts don\u2019t qualify as healthy.",
        "In rural Kentucky, the call to be a preacher can come at an early age. Nick Wilson was born with it. \u201dWe were always in church,\u201d he says. \u201dSunday morning, Sunday night, Wednesday night, Bible school, revivals.

        "America\u2019s culture war, waged in recent years over gender roles, sexuality and the definition of marriage, is increasingly being fought inside evangelical Christian circles.

        "Here are two obvious statements: One, many teenagers love fast food. Two, many of them hate listening to adults. And these are real problems if you\u2019re a fast food company. Increasingly, companies like Taco Bell and McDonald\u2019s are trying very hard to reach teens like me by using social media.

        "Stephen Steinbrink\u2019s unfussy imagery stays detached from meaning. That\u2019s part of what makes his seven albums worth your time: In their lushly arranged pop songs, the listener can tie and untie Steinbrink\u2019s vivid and unrelated images into something meaningful \u2014 or not. Even his new album\u2019s title, Anagrams, suggests engagement through emotional and lyrical rearrangement. The gingerly sweet \u201dBuilding Machines\u201d is deceptively simple, marrying an airy melody with dense instrumentation that recalls the solo work of The Sea And Cake\u2019s Archer Prewitt."
