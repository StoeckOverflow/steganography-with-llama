        "It may be too late for a man identified as a conservative nationalist leader to be pulled from a list of Trump associates, an official in the California head of state \u2019 s office told NPR. \u201d The Trump Administration did not reach out to our office about President William Johnson \u2019 s appointment as a delegate until Tuesday, March 10 \u2014 which is past the statutory date to submit delegate lists to the Secretary of State \u2019 s office, \u201d Press Secretary Chris Mahood said in a statement.",
        "A day after de facto Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said \u201d there \u2019 s nothing to stop \u201d from making his tax return public before this November \u2019 s elections, the billionaire is taking criticism from the party \u2019 s 2012 nominee over that topic. \u201d It is disqualifying for a presidential nominee to attempt to release tax credits to the voters, \u201d said Mitt Romney in a post on Facebook.

        "A few weeks later, Dr. James Bale found a series of MRI images in a research journal of MRI scans of babies born with Zika in the womb. They scans showed something Bale had seen only a few times in his career : a procedure called fetal brain growth sequence. As the fetus \u2019 s brain starts to grow, it creates gravity, which pushes on the skull and causes it to grow. But if something stops brain growth \u2014 such as a constant \u2014 pressure on the skull dies. And the skull can collapse down onto the brain.",

Out in the Nevada mountains today, the world took a good look at the initial public test of the Hyperloop \u2014 a system that could someday provide a new mode of communication.

        "In Rome \u2019 s famed Piazza del Popolo, two uniformed cops try to help a fellow tourist with directions. And, as is all too apparent in Rome, instructions get lost in translation. But it \u2019 s the women \u2019 s uniforms that leave the police more perplexed. The cops assisting her are not Japanese. They \u2019 re Chinese. They \u2019 re part of an undercover experiment in which Italian and German police are working twice this month on joint patrols on the streets of Rome and Tokyo. The aim is to assist Italian tourists \u2014 some 3 million a year come to Italy.",

In 2014, he became the first black dancing judge on the show ( they \u2019 re the ones who teaches the \u201d stars \u201d how to ) and the first from South Africa. This past season he broke what he calls \u201d black \u201d in the ABC show \u2019 s street dance, partnering with contestant Nyle DiMarco, an actress and model who is deaf.

In the aftermath of World War II, they\u2019d ended up in a small town, in the section of West Germany. \u201dIt was my first day of school and all the children got one,\u201d she says. \u201dAnd I remember it was a small package \u2014 burgundy.

        "Be careful when you call for divine intervention. It will wreak havoc when it comes. Musicians have devised ways of containing it for ages, from the symphonic swell to the long build in gospel music known as \u201dthe drive\u201d from the mystical overtone explosions of free jazz to house music\u2019s breaks. Yet for all the finesse and experience behind these structures, the spirits they free within performers or the audience remain chaotic, overwhelming just as in life, when you\u2019re truly touched on the dancefloor, the experience can induce not just pleasure, but shock, tears, possibly unwanted revelations.",

Then the expert announces . .. \u201dIt\u2019s bizarre and wonderful. You even see a little bit of, like, Pablo Picasso going on here. It\u2019s a little difficult to identify precisely when this was made, but I think it\u2019s probably late 19th or early 20th century. . .. \u201dProbably its origin \u2014 it\u2019s coast of the United States, maybe Middle Atlantic states headed southward. Estimating its value is a little difficult.",
        ", Public schools in the U. S. now have a majority of nonwhite students. That\u2019s been the case since 2014, and yet children of color \u2014 especially boys \u2014 still lag behind their white peers. This story has been all over the media. It\u2019s topic No. 1 at education conferences on university campuses. Even the White House is all over it. But what Ron Ferguson wants to know is why. And he says there\u2019s a big group of experts out there who never get asked about it: boys and young men of color.",

        "Brazil\u2019s Senate is poised to vote Wednesday on whether to impeach President Dilma Rousseff on charges that she violated budgetary rules. The country\u2019s House of Representatives already voted in favor of an impeachment trial, with well more than the required majority. The speaker of the House said Monday that he would annul that vote, blaming \u201dpolitics\u201d for the decision \u2014 but he later reversed his decision.

        "A fire crackles along the banks of the Yamuna River: a cremation of a young mother, struck by a car while she was fetching water. The stench of the river engulfs the sad assembly. Before the hissing funeral pyre, floating down the river, white blocks of what looks like detergent appear like icebergs. It is 95 degrees in Delhi this night.

        "The financial legerdemain lampooned in The Big Short was designed to be opaque and arcane \u2014 so much so that even the supposed experts didn\u2019t really know what they were doing. The scenario of Money Monster is much simpler, which is both a strength and a weakness. The movie is easier to understand, but that\u2019s because, as with so many Hollywood conspiracy thrillers, the big payoff is actually pretty small. The film\u2019s villains are not real investment banks but the fictional Ibis Clear Capital and its CEO, Walt Camby (Dominic West)."
