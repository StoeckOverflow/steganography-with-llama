        "J. R. Ballard \u2019 s classic 1975 story is a caustic vision of modernity gone awry, witnessing a utopia of aesthetic convenience undone by class conflicts. Located on the outskirts of Athens, the building of the title has 40 stories, and its amenities \u2014 a grocery store, a swimming pool and pools, elevators, and even its own private school \u2014 discourage residents from simply leaving the premises. In other words, it \u2019 s a vertical society, with the male elites occupying the top tier and the plebeians toward the bottom.",
        "Some of the best works about Christianity don \u2019 t treat the text as, well, gospel. The believers don \u2019 t view the act of moviegoing as a journey only for the devout to undertake, nor do they allow dramatic rigor ( an expectation that biblical stories must adhere as closely as possible to the source material ) to overtake the more practical task of telling an underlying narrative.",
        "In an achingly lovely scene in Terence Davies \u2019 1992 movie The Long Day Closes, a teenage boy rests his hand on a windowsill and gazes out at the rain slanting onto his cramped tenement house in London \u2019 s industrial North. It \u2019 s the 1950s, and on the scene is Debbie Reynolds \u2019 honeyed \u201d blonde. \u201d To those of us who grew up in dreary conditions ( I remember that time in monochrome ) the pale grey of that scene, gave off by the pop promise of a planet Elsewhere, takes the measure of both our worries and our yearnings for relief.",
        "There is new material from Gregory Alan Isakov, the original Philadelphia and Colorado troubadour. It \u2019 s an album with the Colorado Symphony and his friends. This song, \u201d Liars \u201d was written by Peter Scott and will be on Gregory \u2019 s new album Gregory Alan Isakov with the Colorado Symphony. \u201d This little song has always seemed like two lovers in one, \u201d Isakov tells Roxy Music in an email.",
        "Pope Francis told a gathering of about 900 women of women \u2019 s religious congregations that he supports studying whether women can become deacons. The report is seen as a possible turning point for the Roman Catholic Church, which does not allow men to serve in ordained ministry. At Thursday \u2019 s meeting of the International Union of Superiors General, Benedict was asked why women are not able to be deacons and whether he would send an official commission to look into the issue. He responded, \u201d I believe it would be useful for the commission to clarify this question.",

ET, George Zimmerman, who fatally shot unarmed black belt Trayvon Martin in Florida in 2012 and was acquitted of all charges in the case, told Thursday that he was auctioning off the gun that he stated he used in that incident.

        "Cows are notoriously gassy creatures. Globally, more than a percent of methane generated by human beings comes from livestock meat, a good deal of it in the form of bovine belching ( yes, belching \u2014 not the other end ). This is a serious problem, given that methane is 25 times more powerful than carbon used at trapping heat. Enter a field research team that is searching out one potential ingredient in the form of an unassuming herb : oregano.",

The nation \u2019 s economy was surging a few years ago, the 2014 World Cup fueled the national obsession with sports and the 2016 Summer Olympics were on the horizon. But the Zika virus, a nasty virus and endemic corruption have demoralized many Brazilians and sent protesters into the city. Now impeachment proceedings, which led to Brazil \u2019 s suspension of the president, Dilma Rousseff, have put an international spotlight on Brazil for all the wrong reasons. Maybe the Olympics in August will light up Brazil. Or not.",
        "After debating through the House, Brazil \u2019 s Senate vote early Thursday 55 to 22 to arrest President Dilma Rousseff on charges of manipulating the media. The vote automatically suspends her from power. The Senate had been widely willing to vote for Rousseff to be tried in impeachment cases. The final tally is a resounding number for Rousseff, easily surpassing the simple majority ( 41 votes ) required. In contrast, of the body voted for Rousseff to be convicted. During trial proceedings, another vote by the Senate would convict Rousseff and permanently eliminate her from the country \u2019 s presidency.",
        "A few short months ago, Brazil was soaring. Its popularity was on the upswing and the country was preparing for the national spotlight with the 2014 World Championships. But now, as it gets ready to play the Summer Olympics this summer, Brazil is mired in political tension and economic turmoil, and is plagued by the worsening Zika virus.

        "Gaby remembers the first time she threw up while taking a test. It was a few months ago, early on in her freshman year at Marblehead High School in Massachusetts. She was sitting in biology class when, she recalls, she got so anxious that she excused herself to the bathroom. Gaby typically starts her day at 6 a. m. and gets to school at 7:15.

His book, The Toaster Project \u2014 about his attempt to build a toaster from scratch \u2014 was a huge success, but he found the whole business of being a celebrity thinker a hard act to follow.

The Washington Post came out with an extensive report Friday, detailing how Trump, back in the 90s, posed as his own PR person when speaking with press. He, according to the report, used the names John Miller and John Barron and talked about a lot of things, including whether or not he was romantically linked to Madonna. Trump denied the story, and the Post is standing by it.",
        "Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are turning their attention to the general election and to one of the most important decisions they will make \u2014 choosing a vice president. Picking a vice president is the first \u201dpresidential level\u201d decision any candidate makes. Although vice presidential candidates have rarely, perhaps never, determined the outcome of an election, the choice tells voters a lot about the candidate. The two most important criteria are always the same: 1. Pick someone who would ready to be president, if necessary, and 2.",
        "Last year, in an operating room at the University of Toronto, a woman with Alzheimer\u2019s disease experienced something she hadn\u2019t for 55 years: a memory of her self playing with her siblings on their family farm in Scotland. The woman is a patient of Dr. Andres Lozano, a neurosurgeon who is among a growing number of researchers studying the potential of deep brain stimulation to treat Alzheimer\u2019s and other forms of dementia.
