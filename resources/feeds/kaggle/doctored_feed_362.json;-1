        "North Dakota Republican Gov. Pat McCrory defended HB2, the state \u2019 s bathroom code, and said the \u201d political reforms \u201d fed the emergence of privacy issues in politics. \u201d Most voters had never heard of this issue five months ago, until the political left began saying, \u2019 We need different rules and policies, \u2019 not just for public facilities and schools but also for the private sector, \u201d McCrory stated in an interview with NPR \u2019 s All Things Considered.",
        "On Friday evening, the Obama administration issued a \u201d Dear Colleagues \u201d letter to the country \u2019 s school districts calling out what they can do to safeguard the civil rights of children at schools and colleges, focusing on their gender identity. The administration argues that Title IX, which outlaws sex discrimination for any school receiving federal recognition, covers gender identity. The letter does not change any specific laws, but provides what is called \u201d significant guidance. \u201d It describes exactly what policies the Government and Justice departments use to be compliant with Title IX.",
        "The Whit Stillman \u2019 s Love Letter is an improvement on its source, Mary Austen \u2019 s novella Sweet Susan. That \u2019 s not quite as heretical as it sounds. Austen wrote the story early in her career, before Pride and Prejudice. It wasn \u2019 t published in her lifetime. The work isn \u2019 t even hers \u2014 it didn \u2019 t have one. It \u2019 s an epistolary work, told via narrator, and, as such, missing Austen \u2019 s identity as narrator. Her protagonist, young Susan Vernon, is an impoverished heiress with designs on a married woman and a malign indifference to her own teenage daughter.",
        "Dating is plenty difficult as things stand. But suppose romance came with deadlines, and a price for not meeting them. That \u2019 s the dilemma Colin Farrell faces in filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos \u2019 sexual weirdness. The maker of Dogtooth, which takes art schooling to comically absurd extremes, and Alps, which does much the same for the process of grieving, is tackling elements of romance in The Lobster, and let \u2019 s just say that don \u2019 t come much later. Farrell plays Jim, a doughy ( the actor gained 40 pounds for the role ) nebbishy guy whose wife has just left him as the story begins.",
        "Donald Trump says he did not pose as his own representative, denying that it is his voice on a 1991 interview obtained by The Washington Post. In addition to the allegations of the Democratic presidential nominee misrepresenting himself, the woman on the call about women comes out during a campaign that has struggled to engage with female voters. The BBC reports that a publicist calling himself \u201d John Miller \u201d or \u201d John Barron \u201d called journalists from Trump \u2019 s office during the 1970s, \u2019 80s and \u2019 90s, sounding very much like Trump himself.",
        "Donald Trump has made various remarks about his tax plan in recent days that have left some folks pretty confused about just what he \u2019 d like to do. Here \u2019 s a guide to interpreting his remarks. \u201d In other words, it \u2019 s going to cost me a fortune. \u201d \u2014 News conference, Dec. 28, 2015, At a news conference at Trump Tower, Trump made a series of proposals to greatly simplify and cut business and corporate taxes. The proposals could have reduced the top income tax rate from 39.",
        "It \u2019 s been a tough period for air travel. Telephone lines at security checkpoints have stretched across terminals at cities from Atlanta to Denver to San Jose. Nearly 7, 000 Alaska Airlines passengers missed their flights during a spring holiday week in March thanks to security backups. In New Jersey, the operator of the region \u2019 s six major airports considers the situation abysmal and is threatening to privatize the airport system. The U. S.",
        "Brandy Beck calls herself lucky. As a mom, the American Airlines pilot has endured severe breast infections, engorged breasts, clogged ducts, decreased fluid supply, three interruptions while working at work, and pumping in hotel and airplane bathrooms. But unlike some of her mothers, she escaped mastitis. Mastitis is a bacterial infection of the breast that can occur with clogged air ducts if women cannot fully express their breast mass.",
        "Susannah Mushatt Smith, who was believed to be the world \u2019 s oldest person at 116, has died in New York.

        "Almost no one saw Donald Duck coming a year ago, it seems. And there \u2019 s all sorts of as to why : someone blew it. Or maybe it was political scientists \u2019 fault. But there \u2019 s one big reason why so many smart people liked him : He \u2019 s the opposite of what many of the loudest voices in the Republican Party believed they wanted. Last month, GOP pollster Whit Ayres famously laid out what the President would need to take the White House in 2016 and Beyond.",
        "Contested primaries in both political parties have led to another period of record political ad spending, according to a detailed analysis of campaign statistics by the Wesleyan Media Association. The analysis, which covers periods from Jan. 1, 2015, through May 8, 2016, tallies $ 408 million in ad spending equivalent to $ 120 million in 2012 when President Bush sought. Updated at 3 p. m.

        "Is breakfast always the most important meal of the morning? And does eating a morning sugar help us gain a healthy weight? The dogma is based on a blend of cultural values and science ( and more than a little cereal marketing. ) Some of the earliest research goes back to the 1960s, when people in Alameda County, Calif. documented eating \u2019 everyday habits. The association linked eating breakfast \u2014 along with other lifestyle elements, including a good night \u2019 s sleep and regular eating \u2014 to improved health and longevity. But in recent years, this association has come under more scrutiny.",
        "Ahead of our forthcoming podcast, I\u2019ve been in some reading and interviews about the way we talk about, well, white people. Whiteness has always been a central dynamic of American cultural and political life, though we don\u2019t tend to talk about it as such. But this election cycle is making it much harder to avoid discussions of white racial grievance and identity politics when, for instance, Donald Trump\u2019s only viable pathway to the White House is to essentially win all of the white dudes.",

Only 7 percent of the reef has escaped bleaching, according to researchers at the ARC Center of Excellence. Marshall, a professor at the University of Queensland, says the destructive phenomenon is happening in an area the size of Scotland. \u201dBefore this mass bleaching started, we already were at the point of losing 50% of the coral cover on the Great Barrier Reef.",
        "At first glance, it seems easy to spot the point at which Alain Macklovitch\u2019s career leapt into another tier of international stardom. The Canadian DJ \u2014 who goes by the name onstage \u2014 recalls an afternoon in London, where he\u2019d been booked to play a show at a tiny record shop in 2004.

        "Ah, the cardigan: your granny\u2019s cozy used to be available but in limited quantities and colors. It was considered the sartorial equivalent of flossing: necessary, but not glamorous. \u201dThe cardigan used to be something to keep you warm in the work place,\u201d explains Teri Agins, who covered the fashion industry for the Wall Street Journal for years. \u201dIt was not really an accessory you left on \u2014 unless you wore it as part of a twin set.\u201d That look, sweater upon sweater, was considered too prim for a lot of young women. It was their mother\u2019s look.",
        "Dear Sugar Radio is a weekly podcast from member station WBUR. Hosts Steve Almond and Cheryl Strayed offer \u201dradical empathy\u201d and advice on everything from relationships and parenthood to dealing with drug problems or anxiety.

        "Talk to some of the folks who lived through the bombing of 62nd and Osage Avenue in West Philadelphia 30 years ago, and you\u2019ll notice that they refer to the event by its full date. May 13, 1985. That\u2019s how Gerald Renfrow refers to it when we talk about the inferno. His house is about 30 yards from the compound on which the bomb was dropped \u2014 practically ground zero.",
        "After my stories last week on the 30th anniversary of the MOVE siege in West Philadelphia in 1985, in which Philadelphia police dropped a bomb on a residential neighborhood, leaving 11 dead \u2014 including five children \u2014 we were surprised by how many people told us they\u2019d never heard of the bombing. At first, we thought the knowledge gap might be generational. My Code Switch teammate Kat Chow, who was born years after the MOVE incident, had never heard of it. But another NPR colleague who\u2019s about a generation older hadn\u2019t either. Maybe it was regional.",
        "Despite the fiery, complicated past of the 6200 block of Osage Avenue in West Philadelphia, Gerald Renfrow is bullish on its future. He\u2019s one to know he has lived here forever. His parents bought one of the bigger houses on the corner of 62nd and Osage Avenue and he grew up there. When it was time for him to buy his own home, he landed just up the block and raised his own kids there. Then came the fire.",
        "Harry Truman had been vice president for only 82 days when Franklin Roosevelt died, so there was quite a lot he needed to learn when he became president in 1945. \u201dHe didn\u2019t even know the atomic bomb existed,\u201d historian David Priess said. \u201dHe didn\u2019t know about the Manhattan Project.\u201d Priess, a former CIA officer and author of The President\u2019s Book of Secrets, a history of the president\u2019s daily brief, said that experience made Truman resolve that no future president should come into office unprepared.",
        "Heavily funded progressive organizations are coordinating a sustained effort to define apparent Republican nominee Donald Trump. They\u2019ve been messages for months. Now they\u2019re primed to start filling the screens of TVs, computers and smartphones with hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of messages. At the hub of the effort is the main Democratic superPAC, Priorities USA Action. It expects to spend $125 million in TV and digital messaging from this month to election day. That\u2019s twice as much as it spent in 2012. \u201dOur focus is really going to be on Donald Trump himself,\u201d said Guy Cecil, of Priorities.",
        "More than seven months after it began, a wave of Palestinian stabbing attacks against Israelis appears to be slowing. Israeli military officials say Palestinian attacks continue, but the number of attempted attacks has dropped significantly. Notably, they say, stabbing attacks by teenagers acting alone have gone down. As that downward arc took shape, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas went on Israeli television. Speaking on the Channel Two program \u201dUvda,\u201d or \u201dFact,\u201d in late March, Abbas made a remarkable claim. \u201dOur security guys go inside schools searching students\u2019 bags for knives,\u201d he told the Israeli interviewer in Arabic.",
        "\u201dClass of 2016, let me be as clear as I can be: In politics and in life, ignorance is not a virtue,\u201d President Obama told Rutgers University graduates in a commencement address urging broad engagement with the world. His remarks, which stressed \u201dreason\u201d over \u201d\u201d have been widely interpreted as a critique of the de facto Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, though he did not explicitly name him: \u201dFacts, evidence, reason, logic, an understanding of science: These are good things.

        "President Obama is delivering the commencement address Sunday at Rutgers University in New Jersey, on the 250th anniversary of the school\u2019s founding. It\u2019s one of the last times Obama will speak to a graduating class while he\u2019s in office. But it\u2019s by no means his first. In fact, the president has delivered nearly two dozen commencement speeches over the past seven years. A look back at that collection of commencement remarks helps reveal the problems and promises of the days they were delivered. Among the topics that have loomed largest in that time is the economy.",
        "In recent years, there\u2019s been a movement within the restaurant industry. The idea has been to rectify a basic pay unfairness to even out the pay between tipped and untipped employees. Dishwashers and cooks at the back of the house don\u2019t earn as much money as waiters because they don\u2019t get tips. So, do away with tipping, raise menu prices a little bit, and pay everyone a higher wage. But that experiment has failed at some restaurants. Joe\u2019s Crab Shack, the first large U. S.",
        "Last winter, a retired Brooklyn firefighter drove down to Walter Reed Hospital, outside Washington, D.

        "Chance the Rapper is determined. The independent artist from Chicago is a hometown hero. At this point, it\u2019s common to see headlines scurry across your Twitter timeline about his efforts to make his city better. One day, he might be supporting initiatives to curb homelessness on another day, he might be hosting a youth concert to address gun violence. But now, he\u2019s on a new mission: taking gospel music mainstream, with his new mixtape, Coloring Book. His plan of attack has been at least a few years in the making.",
        "Science can sometimes come across as a stuffy, inflexible collection of facts \u2014 absolute truths not to be questioned. At least, that\u2019s the way it is often taught in schools. The reality of science is very different. Scientists are always questioning, holding out the possibility of being wrong, and learning new things by making mistakes. The progress of science is one long sequence if trials and errors \u2014 mostly errors. But emphasizing the tentative, nature of science can be taken too far. Science has taught us some things, after all."
