        "If you think your mind is painful, try working a workday with Justin Schmidt. Schmidt is an entomologist who focuses on a group of bugs called Hymenoptera \u2014 we know them as worker ants, wasps and bees. Schmidt has traveled all over the world searching for bugs... and getting bitten by them. The result of his work is an alarmingly sharp pain index, measuring 83 insect stings on a spectrum of 1 to 4. For comparison, the red fire moth, native to South America is a 1 : \u201d Sharp, sudden, mildly alarming, \u201d Schmidt writes.",
        "In Hindi, the idea goes that to survive, you need three things : roti, either bread or food, kapda or water, and makaan, shelter. India has a roti population. While the country has catapulted to No. 3 in the world for obesity, it \u2019 s also the hungriest country in the world. India has 194. 6 million undernourished people \u2014 that \u2019 s more than half the world total. It \u2019 s what Americans mean when they talk about \u201d food insecurity : \u201d the economic and social impact of limited or unpredictable access to adequate food.",
        "If you \u2019 re reading this section of the site, there \u2019 s a better than ever chance that at one point, you \u2019 ve read a book that saves your life. For literature readers, that \u2019 s not hyperbole \u2014 occasionally, books have a way of finding you when you most need them they certainly can alter the way you look at things, the course of your career. It can feel a lot like magic. It \u2019 s a safe bet that Martin Seay, author of the transfixing fantasy novel The Mirror Thief, feel the same way. His characters usually do.",
        "Populations are shrinking so fast in Southeast Asia that some Japanese and Americans actually talk about the eventual extinction of their civilizations. To tackle demographic declines driven by low birthrates, the new homogeneous South Korea is exposing itself to more immigrants than ever before. It \u2019 s housed most notably in a place called Wongok Village outside the City of Ansan, an hour \u2019 s drive east of Seoul.

        "One concern at the center of North Carolina \u2019 s bathroom bill controversy is safety, but who \u2019 s at risk? Depends on whom you ask. Supporters of House Bill 2 decided to focus on people traditionally male who later transition to female. The HB2 supporters say that without the new law, sexual predators would just say they \u2019 re a transgender individual with the right to use a girl \u2019 s bathroom and easily gain access to potential clients. \u201d He could be there to look at the sex of the opposite sex. He could be there because he \u2019 s a sex pervert.",
        "The legal battle over transgender rights hinges on the Human Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, color and sex. But the word \u201d transgender \u201d wasn \u2019 t always going to be part of the bill. And \u201d sex \u201d \u2014 which, at the time was meant to mean gender \u2014 was not on that list when the bill passed to the House.",
        "It \u2019 s a perennial one : An older student added to the classroom education he \u2019 d first set aside, finally finishing his studies and leaving years later. Occasionally, that story includes detours toward service in war or a natural tragedy. Bobby Ellerbee \u2019 s life, however, is not exactly fictional. He took four months to get his undergraduate degree in journalism from the University of Oklahoma \u2014 but it wasn \u2019 t an obstacle that caused the trouble. Instead, it was a successful \u2014 and extremely diverse \u2014 career, which began even before he stepped foot in a college classroom.",
        "A young English girl unwraps a package from her closet \u2014 a stuffed animal. The girl \u2019 s face breaks into a mask. But after this moment, her life in a family is stark : She gets a bag of gruel, reads in the dark, manages to keep warm with a candle lighter \u2014 then narrowly escapes a bombing, nearly drowns and is rescued from her mother, who sacrifices her savings on a tugboat so her daughter can flee.",
        "Millennials are now as large of a voting force as Baby Boomers according to an analysis of U. S. political data from the Pew Research Center, which defines millennials as people between the ages of. Both generations are roughly 31 percent of the overall electorate. For some individuals, the Generation ( ages 71 + ) is roughly 12 percent of the voting power, while Generation X ( women ) makes up about 25 percent of the electorate.

        "The National Transportation Safety Board investigation into last year \u2019 s bus derailment in Philadelphia has concluded that the train \u2019 s engineer was distracted by radio transmissions before the crash, a federal official briefed on the findings told NPR. A second source told NPR an employee said only that the engineer was preoccupied, but did not specify radio interference. The crash on May 12, 2015, injured eight people and injured scores of others when the train, going 106 miles four hours in a 50 mile per hour zone, hit the tracks.

        "Feminine products are having a surge. With some calling for a red ribbon to take the taboo out of menstruation, politicians across the country are trying to make tampons and sanitary pads as affordable and effective as possible.

In New York, a bill awaits the governor \u2019 s inauguration, and other efforts to improve access to sanitary products are underway.",
        "Seventeen states have different protections to prevent discrimination against transgender people in areas like housing and employment. One of those states is New Jersey, and when employers there want to explain how state law relates to transgender people, many of them call Robyn Gigl. She \u2019 s a partner at a Denver law firm a board member of Garden State Equality, a nonprofit that advocates on LGBT issues, and is openly a transgender woman. \u201d I put a human face on mine, and I consider myself the most normal person in the room, \u201d she says.",

        "Those of us \u201dof a certain age\u201d have always been told to be true to ourselves, with the understanding that maturity will show us a better sense of our true selves. The hope is that we can move forward and look backward with both confidence and (hopefully) not a lot of regret. But musicians of a certain age are often better off if they resist the and look for something new to stretch their sense of self. They rely on a body of work to inspire yet more growth that way, their sound changes while still feeling familiar.",
        "When it comes to the issue of religious rights versus contraception, the only thing the Supreme Court could agree on was not to decide. In an unsigned opinion issued Monday, the court sent a series of cases back to a raft of federal appeals courts, with instructions for those courts and the parties in the lawsuits to try harder to work things out. \u201dThe Court expresses no view on the merits of the cases,\u201d the opinion said.",
        "Pork shoulder, cauliflower and cheese curds are all trending in 2016, according to Google\u2019s tracking of searches. That list might either nauseate you or make your mouth water. Our food preferences are intensely personal, but scientists have tried to figure out why some people are so picky about the things they eat. Jane Kauer is anthropologist who has studied this topic at the University of Pennsylvania and at the Monell Chemical Sciences Center.

        "Before there was Star Wars\u2019 and the robot who famously warned of \u201dDanger, Will Robinson!\u201d on TV\u2019s Lost in Space, there was Eric \u2014 one of the world\u2019s first real robots. He was built in 1928, less than a decade after the word \u201drobot\u201d was first used. He wowed audiences in Britain, where he was created, and elsewhere in Europe and the United States. And then, he disappeared. Now, a team from the Science Museum of London is planning to rebuild him, using original archival materials. They have the technology.",
        "All eyes were on Abdullahi Yusuf when he stepped on the stand in federal court last week in Minneapolis to testify for the prosecution in America\u2019s largest ISIS recruitment trial. As Yusuf began to speak, his words provided a rare, look at how more than a dozen young men convinced themselves that the way to prove they were good Muslims was to travel to Syria and fight for ISIS. The radicalization process in this case was frightening simple. It began with a meal at a Somali restaurant and a pickup game of basketball.",
        "Every movie is set somewhere, yet most movies feel as if they\u2019re happening nowhere at all. They\u2019re set in a Manhattan so generic that the filming was actually done in Toronto, or in a Paris we only know is Paris because we get a shot of the Eiffel Tower, or in an imaginary small town from some unnamed state whose purpose is to be every small town. Such settings have no presence, no weight, no humidity, no purpose \u2014 they\u2019re background.",
        "What\u2019s the best way to help out someone in need? Just give money? Or try to make sure they\u2019ll spend the money effectively? That\u2019s a dilemma that\u2019s faced anyone confronted by someone begging on the street. And it\u2019s an international problem as well. When rich countries give aid to poor countries, how do they know the money will go to good use? The Millennium Challenge Corporation has come up with one strategy. MCC, as it\u2019s called, is a U. S. government foreign aid agency created by Congress in 2004 to fight global poverty.",
        "In two of The New Yorker\u2019s most famous articles, writer Joseph Mitchell tried to answer one question: Who was Joe Gould? Mitchell first introduced Gould in 1942: He was a quirky, possibly mentally ill Harvard dropout who wandered the streets of Greenwich Village and Harlem filling pages and pages of notebooks with everything people said to him. Gould said he was writing the longest book ever he called it The Oral History of Our Time. \u201dAnd actually, the term oral history comes from Gould,\u201d New Yorker staff writer Jill Lepore tells NPR\u2019s Kelly McEvers. \u201dGould coined that phrase.",
        "As researchers work to understand the human genome, many questions remain, including, perhaps, the most fundamental: Just how much of the human experience is determined before we are already born, by our genes, and how much is dependent upon external environmental factors? Oncologist Siddhartha Mukherjee tells Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross the answer to that question is complicated. \u201dBiology is not destiny,\u201d Mukherjee explains.",
        "Donald Trump likes to tout his popularity among conservative Christians, who make up a key voting base within the Republican Party. But even with Trump as the de facto nominee, some evangelicals say they\u2019re unsure about voting for him \u2014 as a matter of conscience. At Fort Des Moines Church of Christ, a sign on the front lawn reads, \u201dAbortion is America\u2019s Holocaust.\u201d Inside, after a rehearsal for Sunday\u2019s service, Pastor Mike Demastus sits down to talk about the state of the presidential race.

        "If Democrats take back the Senate in 2016, they\u2019ll likely have women to thank for it. The party is likely to have at least six female nominees who are challenging Republican incumbents in their states, helping them flip the four seats necessary to take back Senate control, if Democrats hold the White House. And Democrats believe they have the perfect storm brewing to help them do that \u2014 likely the first female presidential nominee coupled with a probable GOP nominee who has a history of controversial remarks about women.",
        "On a recent March morning at his home in a New Jersey suburb, Anthony Mendez was on his living room couch with his daughter. He was watching the previous night\u2019s episode of Jane the Virgin, studying his own performance as the show\u2019s unseen narrator. \u201dI\u2019m like, \u2019That\u2019s Daddy,\u2019 and she\u2019s on her computer, not even looking up.

        "For Tim Goliver and Luther Glenn, the worst illness of their lives started in the same way \u2014 probably after having a stomach bug. Tim was 21 and a college student at the University of Michigan.

        "Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton appear to have split victories in the Oregon and Kentucky primaries Tuesday night. With all counties reporting in Kentucky, Clinton was leading Sanders by a narrow margin of 1, 924 votes out of more than 450, 000 cast. Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes told CNN that Clinton was the \u201dunofficial winner,\u201d but the Associated Press said the race was too close to call.

        "After an unruly and chaotic Nevada Democratic convention over the weekend, Bernie Sanders is doubling down on accusations that the state party treated him unfairly, and he denies that his supporters were inciting violence. \u201dWithin the last few days there have been a number of criticisms made against my campaign organization. Party leaders in Nevada, for example, claim that the Sanders campaign has a \u2019penchant for violence.\u2019 That is nonsense,\u201d the Democratic presidential hopeful said in a statement Tuesday.",
        "Millions more American workers will soon be eligible for overtime pay under a rule being finalized Wednesday by the Labor Department. The rule says anyone who makes less than $47, 476 per year must receive pay for hours worked beyond 40 hours a week. That\u2019s roughly double the current threshold of $23, 660. The measure is one of the most sweeping moves the Obama administration has made so far in its efforts to boost incomes. But it\u2019s sure to face opposition from some business owners. According to the Labor Department, the higher income threshold will make 4.",
        "Nine months. That\u2019s how long Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly and presidential candidate Donald Trump have been feuding. Ever since Kelly asked Trump, during the first televised Republican presidential debate of this campaign season, about offensive statements he\u2019s made toward women. Tuesday night, when Fox broadcast Kelly\u2019s interview with Trump, there seemed to be a truce, but no new information. Trump didn\u2019t actually apologize for anything he\u2019s done or said, and Kelly didn\u2019t push him too hard on anything. You could view it as a bit of a letdown after all the drama between the two."
