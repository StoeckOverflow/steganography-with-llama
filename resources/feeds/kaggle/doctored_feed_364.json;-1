        "Scientists and activists say the case is ongoing : The best way to control the country \u2019 s opioid epidemic is to focus more people on medications that have been used in studies to reduce relapses and, increasingly, overdoses. Yet, only a fraction of the more than 4 billion people believed to need prescription painkillers or heroin in the U. S. are being given what \u2019 s called medication. One reason is the limited availability of the treatment. But it \u2019 s also the case that stigma around the banned drugs has inhibited their use.",
        "Walk past a Railriders game talking to many Trump supporters, and you \u2019 ll get a whole bunch of different reasons people in Southern Pennsylvania are supporting him. Some Republican backers say they \u2019 re worried about ISIS. Others say the economy is their primary concern. But every supporter eventually returns to the same critical quality he is most passionate about in the current Republican nominee : the fact that he \u2019 s not a typical politician. \u201d What a breath of fresh air, \u201d remarked Mike Zuby, who wore a \u201d Look For Trump \u201d to a recent dispute between the Railriders and Pawtucket Red Sox.",
        "At White House state dinners, it \u2019 s customary for a president to nod to the strengths and weaknesses of guest countries. And when considering Nordic nations on vacation, President Obama paid tribute to a particular metal export. \u201d I do want to point out, that Finland has perhaps the most successful metal bands in the country, per capita, \u201d he said, \u201d and also ranks low on good governance. I don \u2019 t see if there \u2019 s any correlation there. \u201d Albert Mudrian is the of the book Decibel Magazine. He says that Swedish metalheads took note of president Obama \u2019 s comment.",
        "The National Academy of Sciences \u2014 probably the nation \u2019 s most prestigious scientific association \u2014 has reaffirmed its judgment that GMOs are safe to grow. But the group \u2019 s new efforts struck a different tone from previous ones, with considerably more space devoted to discussion about genetically modified diseases, including social and educational ones. The report claims an anniversary. Twenty years ago, farmers began growing soybeans that had been genetically engineered to tolerate the popular weedkiller known as Roundup and corn that contains a product, extracted from bacteria, that attacks some insect pests.",
        "They are often called the \u201d missing 28 pages, \u201d and while they are not necessarily missing, they are back in the box again. They are, more precisely, the final 28 chapters of a massive 2002 congressional action on the Sept. 11 attacks that covered more than 850 pages. Those last few pages have never fully been made public and they deal with the extremely sensitive question of government financing of the suicide hijackers who carried out those attacks. President George W. Bush directed that those pages be viewed by human eyes only, and they \u2019 ve remained secret ever since.",
        "Last Week \u2019 s episode of The Mindy Project finally addressed a lingering concern of the show \u2014 that it doesn \u2019 t explore Mindy \u2019 s \u201d otherness. \u201d In it, Ms. Mindy Lahiri \u2014 the character played by series creator Mindy Kaling \u2014 goes on a date with an Indian man called Neel.

        "Exactly 62 years ago, on May 17, 1954, the U. S. Supreme Court held that segregated schools were illegal. The Brown v. Board of Education decision was unanimous \u2014 but it \u2019 s not history yet. Just this morning, a federal judge asked a Mississippi school district to desegregate its schools. The case on which the court was ruling was originally decided during the summer of 1965. The first white plaintiff, \u201d Diane Cowan, died, \u201d was a at the time.

        "Older voters might wonder this election season whether younger candidates are taking them for granted. People 65 and older made up more than a fifth of the electorate, but the problems that concern them are rarely present on the campaign trail. John Pavini, 81, and Tommie Ward, 84, recently heard lunchtime dancing at the Santa Clarita City Senior Center outside of Los Angeles. It takes their minds off their worries about Social Security. \u201d Some people think they \u2019 re gonna change it, keep it. And I live on Social Security, so we need more, \u201d Pavini says. \u201d We need to live.",
        "As a former ambassador and secretary of state, Hillary Clinton has a long career policy track record. That record suggests she \u2019 d be more hawkish than Michelle Obama \u201d and many of her fellow Democrats. But don \u2019 t expect her to fall overboard. She knows all too well the real price that can come with foreign intervention. Here are four ways to know about Clinton \u2019 s contribution to foreign policy : ( We \u2019 ve even broken down Donald Trump \u2019 s and Bernie Sanders \u2019 access to foreign policy. ) If Obama is elected, she \u2019 ll have more foreign policy experience than any president since George H. W. Bush.",
        "In recent years, Donald Trump has released a series of interviews shedding some light on what he means by the policy he advocates \u201d America First. \u201d The interviews are giving a clearer description of the Republican presidential administration \u2019 s approach to foreign affairs. Here are four things to say about Donald Trump \u2019 s foreign policy : Reporters covering President Trump never know what he \u2019 ll say or do next. And that \u2019 s the way he likes it. Trump says it \u2019 s an advantage for the United States to keep foreign reporters guessing.",
        "Vermont Mr. Bernie Sanders has spent much of his presidential campaigning on economic issues. He viewed income inequality as the leading economic and political problem of our time. Less has been spoken about Sanders \u2019 approach to government policy. Here \u2019 s a quick example : Sanders has highlighted his opposition to the war in Iraq throughout the campaign as a way to make a distinction with his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. \u201d I don \u2019 t think you are qualified if you have voted for the ongoing war in Iraq, \u201d he told supporters in Philadelphia last week.",

        "The most tangible sign of a growing American military presence in Eastern Europe, behind the former Iron Curtain, is tucked inside a former military base in rural Romania. Hidden from view is a U. S. naval facility, where sailors use radar day and night to watch for incoming ballistic missiles fired at NATO countries. If any are spotted, the Americans would fire back with Block IIA missiles. A second such American site will also be built in Eastern Europe over the next two years, this one near Poland\u2019s Baltic coast.",

        "A handful of scientists around the United States are trying to do something that some people find disturbing: make embryos that are part human, part animal. The researchers hope these embryos, known as chimeras, could eventually help save the lives of people with a wide range of diseases. One way would be to use chimera embryos to create better animal models to study how human diseases happen and how they progress. Perhaps the boldest hope is to create farm animals that have human organs that could be transplanted into terminally ill patients.",
        "When it comes to sexual assault of students, some say private secondary schools are still being a little too private about how they handle misconduct. A recent Boston Globe investigation found hundreds of students were allegedly abused by teachers and staff at scores of New England prep schools since the 1950s. Many of the perpetrators were quietly let go, and then moved on to at other schools. To many who\u2019ve been through private boarding schools, the stories of sexual abuse comes as little surprise.",

        "Researchers in Arizona are fighting fire with fire. They\u2019re collecting new data on a wasp that may help slow the spread of citrus greening, a plant disease that has devastated millions of acres of citrus crops, particularly in Florida. The disease is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid, an insect which is no bigger than the head of a pin. The psyllid feeds on citrus trees and carries in its gut the bacteria that cause greening. Leaves become twisted and fruit becomes withered and unusable. Once a tree is infected, there is no cure. Eventually, it dies.",

Now I spend so much time in them that I can tell you about every swing set, picnic table and unfenced patch of grass within a radius.

S. are largely geared toward the young, with far less appeal for adults, especially older ones."
