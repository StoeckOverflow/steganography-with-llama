        "He \u2019 s sitting up, looking straight at the camera, despite the bars that hold him in. On the ground before him, recent newspapers are displayed. The message needs no longer : This panda \u2019 s not dead. The \u201d \u201d photo was released by the Taipei Zoo, though Chinese media reported that Tuan Tuan had died of distemper. The zoo states in the posting, \u201d Do not listen to idle rumors, concerned people, \u201d according to a translation by the online site Asian Correspondent.",
        "When someone places you in a photo on Facebook, it \u2019 s usually a nice reminder of a photographic memory. It lets your online social network remember what you \u2019 ve been up to or where you \u2019 ve been. Well, to three men from Illinois, this feature borders on a much more sinister approach. They argue that when someone puts you in a photo on Facebook without your consent, Facebook is beyond the law \u2014 and a federal judge has allowed the case to proceed.",
        "In a dimly lit chamber made of mud and leaves, a shaft of sunlight slices through a hole in the ceiling and lands on a pile of rice. Debendra Tarek, 80, pulls out a handful of the rough brown pieces and holds them up to the beam of light. His bare chest is sunken, and his eyes glow deep in their sockets. \u201d This resists the saltwater, \u201d the tribal elder explains through an accent. This variety of rice, he thinks, allows his family to live here on Ghoramara, the island where they were born.",
        "Today, I like to riff on Sean Carroll \u2019 s stimulating reaction to 13. 7 this past weekend by lining up a few open scientific questions that are particularly baffling. These are the kinds of questions that may not be answerable, which brings us to the complementary side of the subject of knowing \u2014 the fear of not answering. How do we deal with questions that have no answers? They also play an integral part in our search for answers, be it through the sciences, the arts and, of course, different modes of Christian devotion.",
        "\u201d This is an intolerable situation, \u201d Sen. Lamar Alexander said last week in a controversial speech on the Senate floor. The Tennessee Republican is chairman of the Senate \u2019 s education programs, and he is furious with the Education Act. He even gave Alexander some remarkable advice : \u201d If the laws are not consistent with the law, I don \u2019 t believe [ states ] should follow them, \u201d he wrote.",
        "The cause isn \u2019 t fully known, but the loss of an Egyptian plane into the Mediterranean has recently delivered a new wave of trauma to a beleaguered country struggling on several fronts. Sheikh Abdel Fattah \u2019 s hardline rule faces severe criticism at home and abroad. An group is waging an insurgency in the Sinai Valley. The tourist industry has been in the doldrums for months. And the EgyptAir plane that vanished early Thursday marked the world \u2019 s second aviation crash in just over six months.",
        "Updated 5 : 40 p. m. ET, EgyptAir \u2019 s Flight number 804 disappeared during a flight from London to Cairo early one morning with 66 people onboard. At one point it was reported that debris from the plane was found near the island of Karpathos. That finding has been retracted by EgyptAir Vice Chairman Ahmed Adel. \u201d We need corrected, \u201d he told journalists. The wreckage is \u201d not our aircraft. \u201d The Associated Press reports that \u201d as evening fell, the searchers had yet to see any confirmed debris. \u201d The date of the incident has not yet been clarified.",
        "Despite previously lagging in the delegate count, Bernie Sanders \u2019 campaign spokesman told NPR the organization believes Sanders can and will be the Clinton nominee by winning over superdelegates at the 11th ballot. \u201d If we can substantially close the gap between Secretary Clinton and Trump.",
        "The general public ads are already out, and it becomes clear : This election will be selling out ( and hard ) on the airwaves. This week, a major superPAC released two reports attacking Donald Trump on statements he has made about Obama. Here \u2019 s one : This election is definitely on track to be the most expensive campaign. New data this morning confirmed that the number of television ads \u2014 one of the lowest costs of any political election \u2014 is a full 112 percent higher than at this point in 2012.",
        "While Congress fidgets over funding and how to pay for the fight against the Zika vaccine, state and local government departments are scrambling and slimming down. That \u2019 s because these public health agencies have already got their budgets chopped because of the debate. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in April cut $ 44 million from its budget that helps state and federal governments prepare for major health emergencies.",
        "We \u2019 re facing a type of food revolution, and my mother is driving it. Not so long ago, when giants reigned supreme, takeout meant cheap, hot, greasy meals. But a recent Goldman Sachs report indicates that people under 35 are now demanding everything that \u2019 s fresh and healthful \u2014 as well as good. That \u2019 s good news for small entrepreneurs like Steve Wang. \u201d We don \u2019 t want something that everyone and anyone can have, \u201d Wang says. \u201d We want anything that has soul, that has personalization to it. \u201d Wang is of Brooklyn, an Oakland. Calif.",
        "There was a time, in the mid \u2019 80s and early to \u2019 90s, when Shane Lynch was the screenwriter in Hollywood \u2014 and one of the most widely resented, too. As a film brat wunderkind, Black codified the buddy with his script for Lethal Weapon, and a series of commercial hits and films followed, including Lethal Weapon 2, The Next Boy Scout, Junior Action Hero and The Big Kiss Goodnight.",
        "We \u2019 ve all been caught in that hazy state of war between wakefulness and sleep. But the reasoning behind how our brains urge us to sleep when we \u2019 re hasn \u2019 t been completely clear. For the first time scientists have identified the areas in the brain that appear to produce sleep drive, or the cognitive pressure we feel to sleep after being up for an extended period of sleep. The findings, published last Thursday by the journal Science, could lead to improved understanding of sleep drives in humans.",
        "Oklahoma lawmakers have introduced a bill that makes giving an abortion a felony. NPR \u2019 s Tom Ludden told our Newscast unit that the law is the first of its kind, and an action group plans to strike if the governor signs the law into law. Gov. Mary Fallin has not yet indicated what she plans to do. Here \u2019 s more from Wikipedia : \u201d Under the bill, doctors who perform an abortion could serve three years in prison, and lose their medical license. There are no exceptions for rape or incest \u2014 only the patient \u2019 s life.",
        "A team of scientists has developed \u201drobot flies\u201d about the size of a quarter that can perch on almost any surface. The flies were developed at Harvard\u2019s Microrobotics Laboratory, where researchers look to Mother Nature for design inspiration. For years, they have been working on drones that could be deployed in groups. The drones could, in theory, be outfitted with cameras and provide multiple vantage points of a disaster, or link up to make an improvised communications network. The roboflies work, but they also suck up a lot of energy staying airborne.",
        "Nicholas Winton is often referred to as \u201dBritain\u2019s Schindler.\u201d He was a young British stockbroker when, in December 1938, he canceled a trip to go skiing in Switzerland, and instead went to visit a friend in Prague who was helping refugees fleeing from the Nazis. That visit changed his life \u2014 and the lives of many others.

Many of the parents they left behind perished in Nazi concentration camps.",
        "Note: NPR\u2019s First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the Spotify playlist at the bottom of the page. Between her 1996 breakthrough Trailer Park and 2012\u2019s Sugaring Season, Beth Orton embarked on a steady but transition from her signature \u201dfolktronica\u201d sound to styles rooted in far more traditional rock instrumentation. Beats and samples gave way to more guitars and strings, to the point where Orton\u2019s appearance at the Tiny Desk in 2012 found her showcasing new material with the aid of only an acoustic guitar.",
        "There\u2019s an old adage in the television biz: stars don\u2019t make TV, TV makes stars. Perhaps that\u2019s why seeing Late Late Show host James Corden face a Carnegie Hall audience packed with CBS advertisers on Wednesday, dancing and singing his way through a parody of the hit musical Hamilton, felt so appropriate. Corden wasn\u2019t widely known in America until he took over The Late Late Show last year and his carpool karaoke segments turned him into a viral sensation.",
        "Everyone needs a copy editor. (Thank you, Susan and Amy and Pam.) Today, the Texas Republican Party is probably wishing it had one, too. Check out this sentence from the 2016 party platform: As Texas Monthly rightly points out, the sentence actually says that homosexual behavior \u201dhas been ordained by God in the Bible, recognized by our nations founders, and shared by the majority of Texans.\u201d That\u2019s probably not what Texas Republicans meant.",
        "Mention the concept of food waste, and for many people, it\u2019s likely to conjure images of rotting fruit and vegetables or stale meals unfit for consumption. But a lot of the food that gets tossed out in America \u2014 some $162 billion worth each year, enough to fill 44 skyscrapers \u2014 is fresh, nutritious and downright delicious: think plump eggplants, bright yellow squashes, giant, carrots with a crisp bite. The kind of beautiful produce that would be perfectly at home in, say, this giant vegetable paella made by celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s and his team.",
        "She was a mother in rural Ghana. She only wanted four children. But she had seven. That\u2019s a story that Faustina told at the Women Deliver conference this week in Copenhagen, Denmark. works with the reproductive health care nonprofit Marie Stopes International. \u201dShe was let down by the community, the government and us,\u201d told the audience. And there are millions of women like this Ghanaian mom, unable to get access to contraception. But what if you could use drones to transport contraception and medicines to the world\u2019s most remote places?",
        "Morley Safer, who reported from around the world for nearly five decades on the newsmagazine 60 Minutes, has died. He was 84. Safer was the correspondent on the show, and had just announced his retirement last week during a special that recapped his career.

        "Let\u2019s pretend I asked you to run a mile as fast as you can. Now let\u2019s pretend I asked you to run a mile as fast as you can, and if you broke nine minutes, you\u2019d get $90. Which mile do you think would be faster? A new study suggests that students taking a test behave like you or me: They do better with a little incentive. Dollars and cents, that is. Jeff Livingston, the lead author of the study, is a professor of economics at Bentley University in Waltham, Mass.",
        "People have been wrapping their babies like burritos since before there were burritos. My husband described the skillful nurses where I gave birth as \u201dswaddling ninjas,\u201d and by my estimation he had at least his brown belt by the time we left. But people have also been worrying about their babies dying in their sleep for millennia. Today, about 3, 500 infant deaths occur each year, including 1, 500 from sudden infant death syndrome. It\u2019s only in recent years that researchers have explored whether the two are connected: Could the practice of swaddling increase the risk of SIDS?",

        "In a basement office at Purdue University in Indiana, associate professor of engineering practice Brad Duerstock has designed a special space. His desk sits up on cinder blocks, slightly higher than all the rest. In the meeting area, tables have adjustable heights. And in the corner, a few feet away, there\u2019s an early version of one of his latest inventions, something he calls RoboDesk. Behind all this is Duerstock\u2019s work to make his office space \u2014 and the college environment \u2014 easier to navigate for people who use wheelchairs.",
        "In 2009, Emily Vorland went to Iraq with the Army for a year, hoping it would lead to a career in special operations. That dream was derailed not by the enemy, but by a superior officer, who started sexually harassing her. \u201dI said no and then reported it. And my direct chain of command relieved him of his position. However, it was three months later when the retaliation started,\u201d she says. She says that\u2019s when the investigation started to focus on her. It came down to a threat of perjury charges, unless she accepted a general discharge.",
        "Sometimes astronomy can be challenging, but spotting Mars this weekend should be a breeze. Step 1: Head outside right after sunset and look toward the southeastern sky. Step 2: Find the full moon. (So far, so good, right?) Step 3: Look up and to the right, and find what looks like a bright red star. That\u2019s Mars, our planetary neighbor \u2014 getting up close and personal.",
        "We\u2019ve made great progress treating people who are infected with HIV, but if they get cancer they\u2019re less likely to get the care they need, a recent study found. Researchers examined treatment for a variety of cancers, including upper gastrointestinal tract, colorectal, prostate, lung, head and neck, cervix, breast, anal and two blood cancers. With the exception of anal cancer, treatment rates differed significantly between people and those who weren\u2019t infected, according to the study published online Tuesday by the journal Cancer.",

Behind a tall fence, a statue of Bonbibi wears silks and garlands, with a gold headdress. She shelters a boy from a tiger. Every day, forest guard Bhabotaron Paik prostrates himself before the goddess and makes an offering of sweets before he goes out on patrol. When he has finished the ritual \u2014 the puja \u2014 Paik explains that protection from Bonbibi comes with conditions."
