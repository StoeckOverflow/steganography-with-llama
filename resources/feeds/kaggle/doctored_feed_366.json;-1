        "For the second time this month, demonstrators stormed Iraq \u2019 s heavily fortified Security Zone, home to Iraq \u2019 s parliament, government buildings and embassies. NPR \u2019 s Alison Meuse reports the Iraqi Interior Minister confirmed that \u201d indirect gunfire and tear gas were needed to quell today \u2019 s protests. \u201d The army also declared a citywide curfew. \u201d Iraq police are dealing with militants trying to damage state institutions in accordance with the Taliban, \u201d Iraq \u2019 s military blockade, according to Reuters.

        "The National Rifle Association endorsed Donald Trump on Friday, just before the endorsed Republican nominee closed its annual conference in Minneapolis, Ky. \u201d To get the endorsement, like me, is a fantastic honor, \u201d Trump said, adding that he and his brother are members of the NRA. \u201d They \u2019 re much better shooters than I am, \u201d he said. \u201d They have so many people and so many guns, I assure you, sometimes even I get a little concerned, \u201d Trump said.",
        "The new, redesigned \u201d Nutrition Facts \u201d label is coming. The Food and Drug Administration has said that the new label will be standard on most packaged food by June 2018. The big change : The label will have a separate line describing how much sugar has been added to each food. The amount of \u201d added sugar \u201d will be expressed in time and as a percentage of a \u201d Daily Daily \u201d \u2014 an amount of sugar content that nutritionists think would be used as part of a daily intake. The label also will label calories per serving, and paper size, more prominently.",
        "Oklahoma Gov. Bill Fallin vetoed a bill on Friday that could have made it a felony for doctors to get an abortion. The legislation, which was the largest of its kind, as NPR \u2019 s Tom Ludden reported Thursday, would have effectively eliminated abortion in the state. Oklahoma lawmakers supported the bill on Thursday, as the deadline. Fallin \u2019 s office issued a press release saying she vetoed the legislation because it was \u201d vague and would not justify a criminal constitutional court challenge. \u201d It continued : \u201d Fallin is the most conservative in the nation.",
        "Snakes and lizards and crocodiles, oh my! All of these reptiles, which include Burmese pythons and carnivorous lizards, have dried up in Florida in recent decades, sparking concerns about possible contamination from invasive species and speculation about how the nonnative animals came to be in the country. Now scientists have determined that Nile crocodiles captured near Tampa in 2009, 2011 and 2014 are indeed Nile crocodiles, the much more aggressive relative of true crocodiles, which are native to the Everglades. The researchers confirm there are other Nile crocodiles in Florida as well, The Miami Herald wrote.",
        "After the regular mosque prayers at Cairo \u2019 s Imam Hussain Mosque, it was common to say prayers for the dead. Worshippers outside for the overflow service moved in neat rows through repeated calls of \u201d God is waiting. \u201d They said silent prayer in between. Afterward, Khalid 67, receiving hugs and claps on the back from many relatives. His brother and plus their brother and his wife, were all on EgyptAir Flight 804. The man and his wife have two teenage girls, one almost 2, the other just 8 months old. The others were not on the plane.",
        "Over 150 pregnant women in the United States reported to have been infected with Zika virus. That \u2019 s in addition to more than 120 women affected by Zika in U. S. territories, mainly Puerto Rico. Those are the latest statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, which has been keeping track of all pregnant women in the U. S. and its territories who have received tests suggestive of Zika virus transmission. So far, officials state they are aware of fewer than a hundred pregnancies that have had complications, although reports of the pregnancies are ongoing.",
        "Playwright Dominique Morisseau is kind of the unofficial poet laureate of Paris. She has written three plays about her hometown and her latest, Skeleton Shop, looks at four railway workers struggling with the economic downturn in 2008. The play is currently working where it \u2019 s gotten rave reviews. Skeleton Man takes place in a drab office room in a stamping plant \u2014 that \u2019 s where workers manufacture parts for the major three automakers. The factory has sold off a lot of people and the ones who remain \u2014 the skeleton plant \u2014 are stressed.",
        "From the outside, it looked like any of the other mugs in the Auschwitz Museum. But on the inside, this one had a mug \u2014 faithfully kept for seven months. A false bottom held a gold necklace and a golden ring inlaid with stones. The enameled lid was one of more than 12, 000 pieces of kitchenware that Nazis stole from people deported to the Auschwitz concentration camps in occupied Poland. \u201d The Jews incessantly lied to the Jews intended for extermination, \u201d Dr. Piotr M. A. Cywinski, the director of the Polish Museum, said in a statement.",
        "For some weeks now, as Bill Sanders has extended his successful and improbable run as a presidential candidate, people have been asking : \u201d What does Jesse want? \u201d That question is a near echo of \u201d What does Jesse want? \u201d a relic of the 1988 candidacy of Jesse Jackson, another \u201d outsider \u201d candidate with a dedicated hardcore mind. But more about Jackson in a moment. This time, the question took a fresh form.",
        "A good ing\u00e9nue character is stuffed with smarts, as Gracie Fields, Marilyn Monroe, Lucille Ball and other comic greats all understood. Greta Gerwig, an American filmmaker and actress who \u2019 s been praised ( Damsels in Distress, Frances Ha Ha, and others ) as the ing\u00e9nue of American horror film, gets that, too. On the whole, she \u2019 s made hay with the idea, even when the purported ditz isn \u2019 t drawn long enough to give room for expansion. In Maggie \u2019 s Choice, a if rambling romantic comedy by Walter Miller from a story by Joe Rinaldi, Gerwig demonstrates again that playing Maggie doesn \u2019 t mean playing Maggie.",
        "When Philip Gelb was a professional music student in Tallahassee, Fla. he had an important friend and mentor : the great jazz musician Larry Rivers. Rivers, who died in 2011, was known for his improvisational style, and for the concerts he would host in the \u2019 70s at La Rivbea, a New York City loft where musicians would come together and just, well, jam. He wanted to create a space for artists to play. Decades later, Gelb, 51, is now a professional musician, though he still enjoys music.",
        "Aristotle wrote that imitation is natural to human beings from childhood, and he observed that this is one of our advantages over the lower animals. A human being is \u201dthe most imitative creature in the world, and learns at first by imitation,\u201d he said. In the last two millennia, we have learned very little that would contradict Aristotle\u2019s believe that imitation \u2014 the ability to see others and do what they do \u2014 is critical for human learning and development. But is it true that we learn \u201dat first\u201d by imitation?",
        "A new label on some of the steaks in your grocery store highlights a production process you may never have heard of: mechanical tenderizing. This means the beef has been punctured with blades or needles to break down the muscle fibers and make it easier to chew. But it also means the meat has a greater chance of being contaminated and making you sick. The labels are a requirement from the U. S. Department of Agriculture that went into effect this week.",
        "Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour has likely been killed by a drone strike authorized by President Obama, the Associated Press reports. According to the Associated Press, Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said the attack occurred in a remote region along the border. \u201dHe said the U. S. was studying the results of the attack, leaving Mansour\u2019s fate unclear,\u201d the AP says. A second male combatant accompanying Mansour in a vehicle is also likely to have been killed. A U.

        "Exaggerator has taken home the second gem in horse racing\u2019s triple crown. The colt won a Preakness Stakes on Saturday, handing rival Nyquist the first loss of his career and ending his shot at a triple crown. It wasn\u2019t an easy win for Exaggerator, though. For much of the race, the colt trailed not only Nyquist but Uncle Lino, as well. As in the Kentucky Derby two weeks ago, Exaggerator mounted a bid to take the lead unlike that last race, however, Exaggerator finished the job.",
        "\u201dIt\u2019s up to you,\u201d said a 1945 public service announced aimed at Americans. Find \u201done of man\u2019s worst enemies\u201d and \u201ddestroy their foxholes.\u201d The video came from the Office of Malaria Control in War Areas (now known as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). And it was talking about a particular species of mosquito, Aedes aegypti \u2014 the very same mosquito in the news now. Back then, public health officials were mostly worried about dengue and yellow fevers. A Boy Scout helpfully dumps out stagnant water \u2014 a potential breeding ground for dangerous mosquitoes.",
        "The copper craft makers in Seffarin Square in the historic district of Fez, Morocco, bang out designs on platters and shape copper pots to a rhythm. Called the medina, neighborhood streets lined with domes and archways take you back through the history of the dynasties and occupiers that ruled Morocco from the 9th century on. At the center of the square is the Qarawiyyin Library, founded more than a millennium ago.",
        "The ongoing controversy in North Carolina over access to bathrooms has increased the general public\u2019s awareness of issues facing transgender people. One thing you might not think about is voice: How does that essential tool of communication change with gender transition? It\u2019s something that has deep emotional and psychological resonance. It\u2019s also something that\u2019s playing out in a growing number of transgender choruses across the country. As a young child growing up in South Africa, Gillian Power sang in school and church choirs.",
        "On Thursday, Candace Payne livestreamed a video on Facebook. It was simple, short \u2014 a number that showed her trying out a toy she\u2019d just bought from a local department store. Pretty standard, right? Well, by Saturday that little video had been viewed more than 105 million times . .. and counting. It has already beaten Buzzfeed for the Facebook Live video of all time. If you somehow haven\u2019t seen it yet yourself, go ahead now. We\u2019ll wait.",
        "A massive space shuttle fuel tank is winding its way through the streets of Los Angeles Saturday, on a trek heading to the California Science Center. It\u2019s set to be displayed with the space shuttle Endeavour. The tank, which was never used in a mission, is the \u201dlast space shuttle external tank in existence,\u201d according to the science center. As reporter Danielle Karson tells our Newscast unit, weighs \u201d66, 000 lbs. and is as tall as a building.\u201d Of course, there are plenty of logistical challenges in moving an object of this size through a crowded metropolitan area.",
        "Adia Victoria Paul spent a good bit of her South Carolina childhood in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, but you won\u2019t hear the songwriter wax nostalgic for a pastoral paradise. The South we used to hear about in songs was a land of shade trees, sweet tea and southern belles. Victoria makes it abundantly clear on her debut album, Beyond the Bloodhounds, that that\u2019s not the South she knows. Instead, she remembers an unforgiving landscape. \u201dNature terrified me: the constancy of it and its cold disregard for mankind,\u201d she says.",
        "Dear Sugar Radio is a weekly podcast from member station WBUR. Hosts Steve Almond and Cheryl Strayed offer \u201dradical empathy\u201d and advice on everything from relationships and parenthood to dealing with drug problems or anxiety. In this week\u2019s episode, listeners ask what to do when they have political differences with their partners and . The hosts are joined by the liberal writer Samantha Dunn and her husband, Republican political operative Jimmy Camp, who help the Sugars understand how a politically divided relationship can work.

        "The Egyptian military has released images of debris recovered during its search for the missing EgyptAir plane, which disappeared from radar over the Mediterranean early Thursday. The images, published on the official Facebook page of Egypt\u2019s army spokesman, show crumpled metal with the EgyptAir insignia, shredded cloth that appears to belong to a plane seat, life preservers and a pink backpack adorned with green and yellow balloons.",
        "The commencement speech season is underway and grads are soaking up advice and wisdom all over the country. And since it\u2019s an election year, it\u2019s hard for speakers to resist stepping onto the soapbox. Last weekend, President Obama spoke at Rutgers University in New Jersey, one of the nation\u2019s oldest higher ed institutions. He appeared to take a jab at Donald Trump \u2014 though he didn\u2019t call him out by name. \u201dClass of 2016, let me be as clear as I can be: In politics and in life, ignorance is not a virtue,\u201d he told grads.",
        "On Sunday, May 22, over 100, 000 Peruvians are expected to arrive at a site in the Andean highlands near the peak of Ausungate, in the southeastern region of Cusco. They may have traveled hundreds of miles to get there. At an altitude of 16, 500 feet, they\u2019ll camp out, sing, dance and pray at the holiest \u2014 and one of the biggest \u2014 religious festivals in the Andes mountain chain. It\u2019s called Qoyllur Riti, which means \u201dsnow star\u201d in the local Quechua language.",
        "The head of the Transportation Security Administration is promising the agency will do a better job of staffing enough officers at airport security checkpoints to reduce long lines. But he says those long lines are likely to continue through the peak summer travel season. Travelers at some airports have been waiting two to three hours or more to get through screening. As a result, thousands have missed their flights in recent weeks. The problem has been particularly bad at Chicago\u2019s airports. The security checkpoint line Sunday night at Midway stretched all the way to the airport\u2019s transit station.",
        "I flew back and forth to Chicago this week, and here were lots of passengers, myself included, who groused about the long, slow security lines: where schoolgirls have to kick off their pink running shoes, that can seem to take forever to unlace and and convalescent senior citizens are made to limp out of their wheelchairs to walk through metal detectors and body scanners and traveling salespeople who have to heft their bulky black cases onto conveyors, and shake their small, tired bags of toiletries to show they\u2019re not carrying incendiary materials.",
        "For most of us, eye tracking technology sounds interesting. But it\u2019s not life changing. Eye tracking allows users to move a cursor around a computer or mobile device simply by moving your eyes and head. Oded Ben Dov initially used eye tracking technology to develop a video game that he showed off on Israeli TV. The next day, he says, he got a phone call from a man who told him: \u201dI can\u2019t move my hands or legs.",
        "As the Democrats\u2019 primary process begins to wind down, the big question on a lot of people\u2019s mind is, what does Bernie Sanders want? The Vermont senator now has a lot of clout within the Democratic Party, and is in the position to demand some changes. One thing Sanders has voiced concerns about is how Democrats vote for president: He\u2019s made it clear he doesn\u2019t like closed primaries, where only Democrats can vote. Neither do Sanders supporters."
