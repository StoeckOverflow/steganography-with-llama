        "The NBA is a colony of millionaires, where even the benchwarmer earns more than $ 500, 000 a season. But away from the spotlight, hundreds of people are striving to break in, grinding in the major league basketball players of the \u2014 \u201d D \u201d for development. They play for teams like the Canton Warriors in Ohio, the Cleveland Cavaliers \u2019 Michigan. During a season that stretched through towns like Bakersfield and Grand Rapids, there was one shot that missed out \u2014 for both the team and the player who took it. The moment was a single, slowly arcing jump shot.",
        "Baltimore police Officer Edward Nero has been found not guilty of all three misdemeanor charges he faced in conjunction with the arrest of Freddie Gray. Gray died on December 19, 2015, after suffering injuries while in police custody.

        "President Trump announced Monday that the U. S. is fully lifting a weapons embargo against Vietnam.

The president spoke about the decision from Hanoi, during the third day of a weeklong trip to Vietnam. \u201d As with all our defense partners, sales will need to still impose strict requirements, particularly those related to human trafficking, \u201d Obama said at a special news conference with Vice President Tran Dai Quang.",
        "Six weeks of your life. Or 2, 190 days. That \u2019 s about how much the average woman will spend having her periods. For some women, that \u2019 s too many days, too many nights. More women in their 20s and 30s are choosing contraception that helps suppress their menstrual cycles, said Dr. Elizabeth Micks, who runs an clinic at the University of Washington in Seattle. \u201d In general, I think views are changing extremely rapidly, \u201d Micks says.",
        "The U. S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that a black Georgia prisoner convicted of murder by an Indian should have a new trial because the defendants deliberately excluded from the case based on their race. The Court \u2019 s decision reversed as \u201d somewhat erroneous \u201d an earlier ruling by the Tennessee Supreme Court, which had argued the defendant had not proved racial discrimination in the selection of his victims. It has been nearly 30 years since the U. S. Supreme Court set new procedures to counter race discrimination in the seating of juries.",
        "Getting help for victims of torture and other torture used to be just about impossible. It \u2019 s becoming extremely difficult, but weeks of work by activists, nurses \u2014 and increasingly by doctors \u2014 have become new tools to the people, whether they \u2019 re working in a combat zone or a hostile prison environment. These days, film tends to dominate the field, in part because modern art provides glimpses of atrocities seen in real time. Activists, without taking great pains, can record the aftermath of attacks on hospitals, schools and hospitals and post their videos to the Internet.",
        "Eric Arnold had tried to summit Mt Everest before. He survived the disaster and avalanche at base camp in 2015, which swept down the mountain for last season \u2019 s climbing season, The Washington Post reports. And he was at the time for the tragedy in 2014, when 16 guides were injured by collapsing ice at the area \u2019 s notorious Khumbu Icefall. In 2012, the Dutch alpinist climbed it almost to the top, before cold weather forced him to turn back. But this year could be different.",

        "In 2013, Hillary Clinton announced her support for Trump in a Web video, saying \u201d I support it personally, and as a matter of policy and law. \u201d And with that announcement, Clinton ended what had at first seemed to be a tortured opportunity to find her stance on an issue that represents one of the biggest and most rapid cultural shifts in modern times. Few Americans have been in the public eye since than Hillary Clinton. In the past 25 years since her predecessor was elected president, her policies have changed on many fronts.",
        "Suicide attacks in two cities in Syria have left scores of civilians dead. The bombings were ordered by the Islamic State, The Associated Press reports.

S. and there \u2019 s a shortage of the medication available to treat it. Pfizer, the company that offers it, says it \u2019 s experiencing \u201d an unanticipated clinical delay, \u201d and in a letter to Congress wrote that it would be effective just of the usual monthly course until July. The medication, including Bicillin is the recommended treatment for patients with syphilis.",
        "Ralph L. Gleason is my hero. It \u2019 s impossible to get an exact date on it, but I know I started reading his biography in Rolling Stone in the fall of 1973. I was 14 years old and perfectly immersed in music. Reading him, I guess you could write about something and get paid for it \u2014 and then I realized his writing was just as immersive as the music we both loved.",
        "By some estimates, nearly 60 percent of time spend in conversation with other people seeking some form of gossip about personal relationships or personal experiences. We gossip about our friends, we gossip about our enemies, and we gossip about someone we \u2019 ve never before met \u2014 and maybe never will. Why this fascination with gossip? The origins of gossip can be found at multiple levels : social, cultural and developmental. While some forms of gossip are almost always negative or superfluous, others tend to serve a beneficial social role : Gossip can help solidify good relationships and encourage relationships.",
        "Sherman Alexie\u2019s new children\u2019s book stars Thunder Boy Smith, a little boy who was named after his dad. \u201dPeople call him Big Thunder,\u201d the boy says of his father. \u201dThat nickname is a storm filling up the sky.

        "We often associate climate change with too much water \u2014 the melting ice caps triggering a rise in sea levels. Now a new World Bank report says we also need to think about too little water \u2014 the potable sort.

        "We think of aging as something we do alone, the changes unfolding according to each person\u2019s own traits and experiences. But researchers are learning that as we age in relationships, we change biologically to become more like our partners than we were in the beginning. \u201dAging is something that couples do together,\u201d says Shannon Mejia, a postdoctoral research fellow involved in relationship research at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \u201dYou\u2019re in an environment together, and you\u2019re appraising that environment together, and making decisions together.\u201d And through that process, you become linked physically, not just emotionally.",
        "In the 1980s, Raymond Douglas had been living in Ireland when a priest invited him for a drink. This was not an invitation to partake in Holy Communion. Rather, the priest \u2014 whom Douglas, then 18, had come to know as the unofficial chaplain at his school \u2014 had invited Douglas out to a party. While Douglas himself didn\u2019t imbibe any alcohol at the party, he recalls the man of the cloth certainly did. And, under the influence, the priest overpowered the student. Douglas says the priest then proceeded to rape him for more than four hours.",
        "Before the mortgage crisis, real estate seemed like a sure bet. Pretty much anyone could buy a house: no money down, thousands of square feet, second and third vacation homes were not out of the question. Then the bubble burst. Homeowners across the U. S. confronted the reality that their houses were worth a fraction of what they had paid for them. Now, a decade later, even though the recession is over, more than 6 million homeowners are still upside down on their mortgages.",
        "If you\u2019re from New York City you might think of him first as the congressman from Queens who never backed down from a fight for the city or its people. \u201dI will not yield. I will not yield,\u201d he once said. But if you are not from New York and let\u2019s face it even if you are what you probably remember most is the bulging underpants, the famous photo, published from the congressman\u2019s public Twitter account that made him a household name and a punchline back in 2011.",
        "Give the man credit: Congressman Anthony Weiner, having inspired countless headline puns a few years back when he was caught texting crotch shots, put himself out there when most people would\u2019ve run for cover. Apparently brimming with confidence, he allowed a film crew to document what he hoped would be his political comeback \u2014 a run for mayor of New York City \u2014 and filmmakers Josh Kriegman (who was his former aide) and Elyse Steinberg repaid his generosity by treating him utterly fairly, and capturing every inch of his trajectory from tabloid punchline to political .",
        "It\u2019s easy to forget that The Monkees\u2019 original run as a band lasted only from 1965 to 1971, a stretch that included a but sitcom and a string of bestselling albums. For later generations \u2014 especially the ones who came of age amid endlessly repurposed reruns on MTV and Nickelodeon in the late \u201980s \u2014 The Monkees\u2019 music has been reborn in reunion tours and on occasional albums, even as the group itself has dealt with internal strife and the 2012 death of Davy Jones.",
        "So much about the band SHEL comes down to family. The group\u2019s name is an acronym for the four members \u2014 Sarah, Hannah, Eva and Liza Holbrook \u2014 who happen to be sisters. They grew up in Fort Collins, Colo. and were by their mother, but it was their dad who really pushed his daughters to learn music and singing together.

        "In a lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, all the work that happens in a vast pharmaceutical manufacturing plant happens in a device the size of your kitchen refrigerator. And it\u2019s fast. This prototype machine produces 1, 000 pills in 24 hours, faster than it can take to produce some batches in a factory.

        "The musician Anohni \u2014 formerly known as Antony Hegarty, of Antony And The Johnsons \u2014 is known for her melodic, music and her unique, beautiful voice. On her new album, the first solo record she\u2019s recorded as Anohni, she uses that voice in a different way. \u201dI was beginning to feel like my work was too passive and my participation was too passive,\u201d she says. \u201dI wanted to raise my voice. Because I feel like raising your voice is the antidote to a sense of powerlessness.",
