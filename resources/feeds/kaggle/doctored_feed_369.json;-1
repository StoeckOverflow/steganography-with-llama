        "This election race may well come down as the election, thanks to Donald Trump \u2019 s ceaseless efforts to inject unsubstantiated fraud into the American political system. In an interview with the Washington Times Monday, Trump admitted, without evidence, that Bill Clinton was involved in the killing of Vince Foster, a White House aide who committed suicide in 1993, the first victim of Bill Clinton \u2019 s career. ( That came on the same day Obama, the de facto presidential nominee, unloaded a double whammy on his former Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.",
        "Donald Trump has knocked out all of his rivals for the Republican nomination, but you wouldn \u2019 t know it by looking at his campaign schedule. The real estate developer is working out on his biggest campaign budget since becoming the de facto nominee \u2014 and he \u2019 s really focused on primary issues. New Mexico, Wyoming, Montana aren \u2019 t exactly major election battlegrounds, but they \u2019 re all places where Donald is going this week. \u201d means he \u2019 s going to be the nominee tonight, but this keeps voter momentum in the process.",
        "Bernie Sanders \u2019 campaign has requested a \u201d recanvass \u201d of ballots in the Kentucky primary \u2014 not a \u201d recount. \u201d They are not the same. What \u2019 s the difference? As NPR \u2019 s Asma Khalid states on air \u2014 a recanvass will \u201d entail checking all of the vote machines and absentee ballots in all each of the nation \u2019 s counties to verify the consistency of the vote totals. \u201d In other words, individual ballots will not be checked. A recount would have how people voted on actual ballots. Bill Clinton leads Republicans by less than 2, 000 votes following the May 17 primary.",
        "At the end of 2013, snowy owls started showing up far south of their usual winter state. The big white cases were reported in South Atlanta, Georgia, even today. Dave Brinker, an ecologist with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, had never seen anything like it. Snowy owls usually don \u2019 t venture far farther south than Florida. In the winter of 2013, one was seen near Jacksonville, Fla. \u201d anything huge is going on, \u201d Brinker tells his colleagues.",

        "This story is book 2 of a series. See our little piece about insurance companies that profited $ 400 million after Superstorm Sandy here. The morning of Superstorm Sandy, Nick and Diane Camerada decided not to evacuate. Instead, they stayed with their four children in their Staten Island, N. Y. home. In 20 years, their house had never flooded. They thought : How bad could it be?

He was the youngest of the 285 contenders in this year \u2019 s competition, and even though he misspelled \u201d bacteriolytic \u201d in Round 3, he will not be forgotten. Akash appears in an official ad for the series and has been on NBC \u2019 s Little Fast Shots.

        "You may have heard that Sean Penn \u2019 s historical drama, The Last Word, got savaged at the Cannes Film Festival this week. Reviewers said ( and let me just note that I \u2019 ve not previously seen the film ) that while Penn centers the story on a struggle between two NGO officials ( Charlize Theron and Javier Bardem ) he uses African conflict and tragedy theme as a backdrop. A common lament was that the human characters weren \u2019 t individualized \u2014 the Hollywood world said they amounted to \u201d film wallpaper. \u201d Harsh, that. But it \u2019 s a complaint frequently aimed at Hollywood films based in Africa.",

        "Stanton Gleave certainly fits the stereotype of a modest, modest rancher. Standing in a collection of dog pens taking a break from shearing cattle near his home in West Kingston, Utah, Gleave gives an earful about his frustrations with the Bureau of Land Management and environmental groups. \u201d That \u2019 s who we \u2019 re currently fighting with, \u201d says Gleave. \u201d They \u2019 ve indoctrinated and moved into this BLM and Forest Service \u2019 til a lot of \u2019 em are lined up in the head positions now. \u201d Gleave has worked his whole life working sheep and cattle.

        "Shareholders of Exxon Mobil and Chevron have voted to adopt a series of resolutions aimed at encouraging the companies to take stronger actions to stop climate change.

        "You can \u2019 t help but notice that Scott Pitnick has a big secret. It \u2019 s a sperm with a long penis that winds down his right forearm. People sometimes stare. \u201d And when I tell them what it is, they either are very shocked or they pivot on their heel and walk away, \u201d says Pitnick, an evolutionary biologist at Syracuse University. \u201d All eye contact ceases. \u201d Some people just don \u2019 t like talking about sperm. But not him. He \u2019 s spent his career trying to unravel the mystery of giant sperm.",

        "Whenever I\u2019m out reporting in the field, I can tell many ranchers have a powerful connection with their cattle \u2014 it seems they can almost understand them. But researchers today are digging deeper to figure out exactly what cows are saying \u2014 and how they communicate through their moos. I drove out to the research farm at the University of Missouri to ask cattle geneticist Jared Decker to share his expert insights. \u201dI can\u2019t translate cow moos into English,\u201d he says.",

        "Renewed controversy over heavy American military presence on the Japanese island of Okinawa swirled as President Obama arrived in Japan for the G7 summit. Just a week earlier, a former U. S.

        "The U. S. has around 800 military bases outside of the nation\u2019s borders. They\u2019re home to hundreds of thousands of troops and family members, and, in many cases, they\u2019re a cause of controversy. David Vine, an associate professor of anthropology at American University, argues that we\u2019ve become too dependent on such overseas bases \u2014 and that many of them cause serious opposition abroad. He lays out his thinking in his new book, Base Nation: How the U. S. Military Bases Abroad Harm America and the World. Most of the bases were established during or shortly after World War II.",
        "Assaga is an unlikely location for a people\u2019s settlement. Niger\u2019s main highway runs through the heart of a sweeping expanse of desert that is the sprawling camp. Flimsy straw huts, some stitched together with plastic sheeting, dot the arid, dusty landscape on either side of the major road. These makeshift dwellings are home to some of the 160, 000 displaced people within Niger\u2019s southeastern Diffa region, as well as 80, 000 Nigerians who\u2019ve sought refuge from across the nearby border. All were fleeing Boko Haram attacks that destroyed their homes and villages.",
        "One of the most talked about politicians this election year is a woman who is not even on the ballot \u2014 Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. As her name is being thrown around as a possible VP pick for Hillary Clinton, there\u2019s an argument to be made that Warren doesn\u2019t even need the job. Plenty of her colleagues say she already exerts enormous influence from her perch in the Senate. Warren may not be running for president, but right now there\u2019s probably no one in the Democratic Party who takes more delight in publicly ripping into Donald Trump.",
        "One way we know we are (finally) nearing the end of this presidential nominating season is that both major parties have begun talking about big changes to the way they choose their nominees. Both parties have been stunned by outsider candidates in this cycle. But the shock seems to be moving them in opposite directions. That may be because one party\u2019s outsider has actually won the nomination while the other\u2019s is falling short. Some in the GOP are distressed at Donald Trump\u2019s taking over, and they want to restore more party control.",
        "In the marshy woods of Secaucus, N. J. a mosquito can make a happy home.

That\u2019s the number of delegates needed to clinch the Republican nomination, and he got there after 29 unbound Republican delegates decided to support him at the convention. NPR\u2019s Don Gonyea spoke to some of those delegates to ask what made them decide to support Trump. On switching support from Cruz to Trump, I was committed to supporting Ted Cruz all the way to the convention, regardless of if Mr. Trump has 1, 237 or not. But when Mr.",

        "The politics team is back with its weekly roundup of political news. The team discusses why we can now say officially that Trump is the presumptive nominee for the Republican Party, why we\u2019re still talking about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and why everything happening now goes straight back to the \u201990s.
