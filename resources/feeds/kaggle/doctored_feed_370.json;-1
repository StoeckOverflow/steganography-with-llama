        "A germ that can \u2019 t be treated with an antibiotic that is often used as the last ingredient has shown up for the first time in the United States.

The germ was detected in a woman in Pennsylvania with a urinary tract infection. The infection was caused by E. coli bacteria that had a drug that made them resistant to an antibiotic known as colistin. The findings were published every Thursday in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy.",
        "The Food and Drug Administration seems focused on bringing sugar out of the bottle. Not only will food companies have to define, right on the package, how much sugar they \u2019 ve added to food they also will have to call it by its new name. The FDA is taking aim at one of food \u2019 s cover identities : evaporated fruit juice.

S. president to visit Japan, site of the world \u2019 s last atomic bombing. Barack Obama also has put the U. S. on course to spend around $ 1 trillion on upgrading its weapons arsenal over the next three years, critics say.

        "There are six major superhero movies out this season : Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice, Captain America : Civil Wars, : Apocalypse, Doctor Doom, Deadpool and Suicide Squad. Now look how many are directed by females. If you guessed zero, you \u2019 re crazy! Only one woman has ever directed a major comic book superhero movie for the big screen. Her pseudonym is Lexi Alexander and the last was Punisher : War Zone, from the mainstream comics universe. Punisher was a flop when it first came out in 2008, but has since established a small but passionate fan base.",

        "When we covered the stories about four Frontier Force pilots who said their planes did not provide adequate accommodations for drinking breast milk, more than a few passengers seemed to feel like the women just wanted an immediate work break. \u201d Bathroom treatments are necessary to ensure the men can still perform, \u201d a commenter commented. \u201d Breast pumping is not. \u201d Au contraire, including women, lactation consultants and health service providers. The painful symptoms of engorgement can lead to medical failure and reduce milk use. And it can make it extremely hard to focus on the job.",

Come on, folks. Let \u2019 s go. Go on. \u201d He has every reason to campaign for the women \u2019 s vote. It \u2019 s a big bet in any given Presidential election these days that men will vote more Democratic than Trump. This year, given Obama \u2019 s abysmal poll numbers among women, it looks like an even surer bet than Trump.",
        "The U. S. nuclear weapons system essentially runs on a computing system that uses floppy disks, according to a newly released recommendation from the Government Accountability Office. That \u2019 s different. It relies on memory access that hasn \u2019 t been commonly used since the 1980s and a computing system that works like this : Beyond the war program, much of the technology used by the federal government is woefully outmoded, the report says.

        "NASA calls off today \u2019 s effort to inflate an expandable module attached to the International Space Station after its first missile fell flat. The concept is called BEAM, Bigelow Expandable Activity Module. It \u2019 s a prototype of what may be a new kind of crew quarters in space. The beauty of an expandable module is that it can be folded so it takes up less room in a normal rocket, and then expanded once it left space. Folded up, BEAM looks like a partially crushed tin can, about 7 feet long. Inflated, it looks more like a watermelon.",

        "The original Roots miniseries, based on the 1976 Alex Haley novel tracing his own family tree from African tribal life to American slavery and freedom, was a phenomenon. ABC showed it over consecutive nights in January 1977, not because it was expected to earn huge ratings but because network executives were afraid it wouldn\u2019t. So they crammed the entire miniseries into an marathon, which aired, by coincidence, during a massive winter storm that snowed in much of the Northeast.

        "The political revolution that Bernie Sanders began may still be felt at the ballot box this November even if he\u2019s not the Democratic nominee for president.
