        "Pit lane on race day is an unexpected rush. Especially on Saturday at the 100th run of the Indianapolis 500, where the crowds are sold out and the stakes are increased. IndyCar pit crews have just begun to change four cars and refuel their driver \u2019 s car, all while other teams fly past. In this type of work, members of pit crews expect to become pretty banged up. The NASCAR Grand Prix of Laguna Beach is one of the two races in California that builds up to Sunday \u2019 s Indy 500.",
        "Even true racing fans might be surprised to learn that in the 1920s a celebrity would grace the face of the program. But then, what better way to get the juices flowing, like the exhaust, screaming flags and checkered flags, than a few lines of poetry? In case by now you didn \u2019 t know it, the Indy 500 has brought back its glory. It \u2019 s the 100th running of the famed American race. So it seemed a right time to wax poetic and poetic at the same time.",
        "Researchers are considering a system to teach robots how to feel pain. That could seem counterintuitive, as IEEE researchers points out. After all, \u201d One of the most shocking things about robots is that they don \u2019 t experience pain. \u201d That means \u201d we have no problems putting them to work in dangerous environments or having them perform treatments that range between slightly lethal and definitely fatal to a robot. \u201d But the researchers from Leibniz University of Iowa argue that the \u201d artificial neural nervous system \u201d really makes the robots stronger.",
        "So, this is happening : Some white supremacists have anointed Taylor Swift an \u201d Aryan female, \u201d claiming that she secretly espouses religion and is waiting for Donald Trump \u2019 s ascension to the presidency to make her racial views known. For the record, Swift has no affiliation with any white supremacist groups. She has never previously made any white supremacist accusations, nor has she ever been accused of supporting them in private. There is no reason to think she has any interest whatsoever in any of this. So where did it come from?",
        "It \u2019 s been a week of major powwows : the World Humanitarian Summit in France, the Summit in Japan, and the World Health Organization \u2019 s International Health Assembly in France. But if you happen to be a horse, there was still only one gathering that day : The annual general gathering in Paris of the World Organization for Animal Health ( or OIE as the term is known by its French name ). Before we get to the stakes for equines, it \u2019 s worth noting that this year \u2019 s OIE \u2014 which started Friday \u2014 was just as focused on the homo sapiens among us.",
        "As if an $ bank heist wasn \u2019 t substantial enough, it now appears that the link may mark the first time one individual has used malicious code to collect money from another country. The link to North Korea was made by security experts at the firm Symantec. In looking into the attack on the bank in Bangladesh, the investigators found a rare fragment of code that has only ever been used in two other hacker attacks : Moving Pictures in December 2014, and various companies in South Africa in 2013.",
        "American agriculture should be in full swing right now. But some farmers are running late, waiting on work visas for planters and pickers from out of the country. The visa program is open for the third year in a row. It sounds like the sequel to a bad joke : A scientist and a doctor walk past a farm. Kathleen Terrence, a pediatrician, kneels in an onion farm outside Lisbon, N. Y. with a bunch of kids. As they attempt to plant some 30, 000 onions, they \u2019 re all taking lessons from Mark Sturges \u2014 but he \u2019 s no farmer, anymore.",
        "It should be a fairly straightforward matter for a press protection organization to get the journalists to attend meetings at the United Nations, an international institution whose charter calls for the respect of human dignity and basic freedoms. Instead, the Convention to Protect Journalists found itself in what it called a \u201d \u201d process, deferred for years \u2014 and on paper, blocked by 10 countries, notably Russia and China, which CPJ named the biggest jailer of journalists in the world.",
        "This year \u2019 s Atlantic hurricane season is said to be \u201d \u201d the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration System. The season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30. \u201d In the Atlantic, the hurricane will likely produce a total of from 10 to 16 tropical storms. Six to eight of those are expected to produce hurricanes, \u201d says NOAA Administrator Brian Sullivan. There could be one to four major hurricanes \u2014 Category 3 or higher and with winds of at least 111 miles per hour.",
        "Nearly four dozen athletes from eight countries and in five nations who competed in the 2012 London Paralympics have tested positive for illegal substances after doping samples were rechecked. The Australian Olympic Committee made the announcement Friday, announcing that it had retested 265 samples. The news reported revelations last week that results from 31 athletes in the 2008 Beijing Olympics had suspicious results out of 454 retests. \u201d All competitors found to have infringed the rules will be suspended from competing at the Olympic Games Rio 2016, \u201d the IOC said in a statement. Why are we learning about this now?",
        "By the time his first memoir, Fresh Off The Road, came out in 2013, Eddie Lee was really hitting his head. His New York restaurant, Baohaus \u2014 which serves gua bao, or Taiwanese hamburgers \u2014 was doing quite well. His TV show, Huang \u2019 s World, was leading him all over the world. His memoir \u2014 a humorous, funny and sometimes profane story of growing up as an kid reconciling Western cultures \u2014 was turned into a new sitcom for ABC. But then he fell in love \u2014 with a White, Inc. And his world turned.",
        "The 1990s are back. For decades Donald Trump has been told that he planned to attack Bill Clinton for the sex scandals that embroiled her husband \u2019 s presidency in the \u2019 90s. He has said she \u201d publicly \u201d her husband \u2019 s infidelities and \u201d hurt \u201d the women who were his accusers, although he hasn \u2019 t offered any idea of how she did that. Trump told the Washington Post that he \u201d will play at every level I have to play at, \u201d and this year he took this line of thought to a new level.",
        "A watercolor by David S. Goodsell just would make the Zika virus easier to visualize. The painting, which depicts an eye about 110 nanometers wide ( a nanometer is a billionth of a meter ) depicts the virus in the process of infecting a human. Zika is primarily transmitted through the blood of an infected female Aedes mosquito. Although the virus was originally discovered in a rhesus monkey in Uganda \u2019 s Zika country in 1947, the first study determining the structure of the virus was only completed in March of this year.",
        "On San Jose State University\u2019s lush campus, students in their graduation gowns pose with their families in front of buildings. They\u2019re the lucky ones. Just 10 percent of students graduate from this public university in four years. After six years, it\u2019s only a bit more than half. Think about that \u2014 of 100 students who enrolled four years ago, only 10 will walk across the stage this year. That sounds low, but you can find these kind of numbers at lots of universities in the U. S. What\u2019s not typical is how San Jose State is tackling the problem.",
        "Editor\u2019s note: John Otis has reported from Latin America since the U. S. invasion of Panama in 1989, and first covered Venezuela 19 years ago. He\u2019s returned many times since, and reflects here on how the country has changed since he first arrived. During my first reporting trip to Caracas in 1997, I was nearly robbed leaving a subway station. While riding up the escalator, I was sandwiched by two rather inept thieves who pried my wallet out of my pocket, but then dropped it. I snatched the billfold and ran.",
        "The World Health Organization is trying to ease concerns about spreading Zika as a result of this summer\u2019s Olympics in Rio de Janiero. \u201dBased on current assessment, cancelling or changing the location of the 2016 Olympics will not significantly alter the international spread of Zika virus,\u201d a statement released Saturday reads. This comes a day after more than 150 scientists released an open letter to the head of WHO calling for the games to be moved or postponed, citing new research.",
        "Savannah Buist and Katie Larson are two members of a band called The Accidentals. The band\u2019s most recent single is called \u201dMichigan and Again,\u201d and \u2014 if you couldn\u2019t tell \u2014 it\u2019s a love song for their home state. They do love Michigan, but the way the song came about was actually something of an accident. The band needed to raise money to go on tour, so it asked fans to donate. The members said that in exchange for a certain amount of money, they\u2019d write a song about a topic of the donor\u2019s choosing.",
        "For Keats, joy was a grape bursting in the mouth: sudden, flooding, and sweet. And, of course, impermanent. Food and feeling are natural partners this debut novel, set in a Manhattan restaurant, is a feast of both. \u201dSweetbitter\u201d is an epithet of Eros first used by Sappho, poet laureate of the literature of longing. In the fragment that gave Stephanie Danler her book\u2019s title, Sappho calls Eros sweetbitter, the one who can\u2019t be fought.",
        "This election has brought a bitter primary season: candidates at each other\u2019s throats a Democratic Party in crisis. But it\u2019s nothing new. Eight years ago, the Democratic Party was recovering after a brutal primary between Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Now, the party has found itself in a similar place. This week on For the Record: Lessons learned from the 2008 Democratic primary, with two political operatives who lived through it. Back then, Mo Elleithee and Bill Burton were each fighting for a potentially historic win in camps that got increasingly competitive.",
        "A British museum has been searching for parts of the Lorenz cipher machine, used by the Nazis in World War II to send secret messages. So when museum volunteers happened upon what appeared to be a Lorenz teleprinter on eBay, it almost seemed too good to be true. National Museum of Computing volunteer John Whetter went to Essex to investigate. There, he found \u201dthe keyboard being kept, in its original case, on the floor of a shed \u2019with rubbish all over it\u2019,\u201d the BBC reports.",
        "Dear Americans, I hear it\u2019s swimming pool season for you. Enjoy it while it lasts. And as you complain about the crowds at the nearest pool and the annoying list of rules, think of me, envying you. When I lived in Boston, I swam in a public pool. I loved the quiet, the order, the rope floats that demarcate lanes, the chalkboard with chlorine and pH levels, even the smell of chlorine. But I especially loved the rules.",
        "You could call it the parenting trap. Being a parent comes part and parcel with being judged by other parents. And parents aren\u2019t always shy about giving their opinions on others\u2019 parenting style \u2014 be it on parenting blogs, articles, books or at the playground. Last year the major controversy was over \u201d parenting.\u201d This year, two parenting writers are offering new, and sometimes opposing, ideas. Heather Shumaker is the author of the book It\u2019s OK to Go Up the Slide.",
        "Queen Brown has told the story for years now, and it shows. But it doesn\u2019t sound rehearsed. It sounds lived in, thought over, played on repeat over and over again. The story of her son, Eviton Elijah Brown, killed nine years ago, shot by a man Eviton didn\u2019t even know. Eviton had been a student at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, or FAMU, before he was shot. He took some time off from school, to work after his girlfriend got pregnant. He was staying at home with his mother.",
        "More than 1, 000 Libertarians from around the country have converged on a hotel in Orlando, Fla. for a long weekend of politicking, strategizing, and seminars with titles like \u201dHow to Abolish Government in Three Easy Steps.\u201d They\u2019ll also choose their nominee for president on Sunday. Five men are competing to be the Libertarian including a software tycoon, a magazine editor, and the former Republican governor of New Mexico. \u201dLibertarian conventions are always exciting,\u201d says Carla Howell, the party\u2019s political director.",
        "In a sunny patch of grass in the middle of Indianapolis\u2019 Crown Hill Cemetery, 45 people recently gathered around a large blackboard. The words \u201dBefore I Die, I Want To . ..\u201d were stenciled on the board in bold white letters. Tom Davis led us through the thousands of gravestones scattered across the cemetery. He\u2019d been thinking about his life and death a lot in the previous few weeks, he told us. On March 22, he\u2019d had a heart attack.",
        "After devouring Touch last year, I was fiercely excited for Claire North\u2019s next book, all the more so when I learned its premise: Hope Arden is a young woman who cannot be remembered, except by animals or people whose brains have been damaged. Turn away from her, and everything about her and your interaction with her fades from your mind\u2019s view. When a life improvement app called Perfection leads to a friend\u2019s suicide, Hope sets out on a dangerous path to investigate its makers and whether there\u2019s any connection between the \u201dtreatments\u201d Perfection\u2019s clients receive and her own condition.",
        "#NPRreads is a weekly feature on Twitter and on The . The premise is simple: Correspondents, editors and producers from our newsroom share the pieces that have kept them reading, using the #NPRreads hashtag. Each weekend, we highlight some of the best stories. The aging beat can be a bummer, and good news stories about getting old can end up sounding like a chirpy promo for AARP insurance. But as journalist Linda Marsa points out, a lot of people are getting old while staying remarkably healthy.",
        "Mel Atkins has spent most of his life with Grand Rapids Public Schools in Michigan. He graduated from Ottawa Hills High, where he played baseball. But his real love was bowling. He says he\u2019s bowled 22 perfect games. He\u2019s been a teacher and principal in the city\u2019s public schools. And now he works for the district, overseeing just about everything related to students. One more thing you need to know about him: Mel Atkins is a . Three years ago, the superintendent came to him with a question: Does Grand Rapids have an issue with chronic absenteeism?",
        "Flowers generate weak electric fields, and a new study shows that bumblebees can actually sense those electric fields using the tiny hairs on their fuzzy little bodies. \u201dThe bumblebees can feel that hair bend and use that feeling to tell the difference between flowers,\u201d says Gregory Sutton, a Royal Society University Research Fellow at the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom. People used to think that perceiving natural electric fields was something that animals only did in water. Sharks and eels can do it, for example.",
        "Will this summer be hotter than average? How much rain can we expect? A key step to answering questions about the weather is to consult the historic record. But what if there were no record? That\u2019s the predicament that Rwanda faces. The civil war and genocide that devastated that country in 1994 also destroyed Rwanda\u2019s system for tracking weather. The result was that for a roughly stretch, Rwanda has almost no record of what its weather was like. \u201dThat period was totally lost,\u201d says Didace Musoni, a top official at Rwanda\u2019s meterological agency."
