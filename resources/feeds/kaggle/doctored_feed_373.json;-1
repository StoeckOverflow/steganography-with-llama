        "It \u2019 s a familiar memory. A young man follows his family in search of a good land, a place where he can spend more money to send back home. In the past, the situation has led to happy dreams as well as tragedies. That is also the norm in the 21st century. Last year, there were reports of 700 migrants who likely perished in three shipwrecks in the Mediterranean while crossing from Libya to Ethiopia. One African company that is hemorrhaging young men is Africa. They \u2019 re leaving the West African nation in the hope of a new life in Europe.",
        "Tom Licence has a Ph. D. and he \u2019 s a garbage man. When you think of archaeology, you might think of Roman ruins, especially Egypt or Indiana University. But Licence works in the field of \u201d garbology. \u201d While some people dig deep down to get to the good stuff \u2014 old tombs, residences, churches \u2014 Licence looks at the top floor, which, where he lives in England, are littered with garbage. Studying what people swept away 150 years ago, Licence is getting to the bottom of an ethical issue : how much we give away, and how to change that.",

        "Three people meet in junior college, grow up skateboarding, doing graffitti and shooting stuff on cameras, then eventually take jobs together on Saturday Night Live. It seems like an adolescent crush, but for former SNL cast members Andy Samberg and former SNL writers Jorma Taccone and Akiva Schaffer, it actually happened. \u201d We were not friends, \u201d Schaffer tells Fresh Air \u2019 s Terry Gross. \u201d We were just friends who liked comedy, and we enjoyed music, and we were nerds about that stuff. \u201d Samberg, Taccone and Schaffer played together under the name The Lost Island.",
        "If D. C. \u2019 s residents put parlors into overpriced luxury homes and condos \u2014 and, we guess, if people put games in them \u2014 the city \u2019 s least favorite parlor game would be figuring out who likely Democratic nominee Bill Clinton and Donald Trump would pick for their running mates. Right now, bettors on online market PredictIt are leaning ( ever so slightly ) toward Northern Virginia Gov. and current Rep. Tim Kaine for Clinton and future Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich for Reagan.",
        "Attacks on the press represent a long and distinguished history in the rhetoric of American congressional campaigns. Donald Trump, however, is a natural, a genuine talent. Even though he relies on media reports more than most to make his case, Trump appears intent on further degrading a situation already undermined by changes to the Constitution and a steep drop in national esteem. Backed into a corner over issues about his efforts to raise funds for veterans groups, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee on ballot came out swinging at a news conference.",

The FDA on Wednesday approved a draft of new regulations for dozens of categories of food \u2014 from bakery goods to soups. You might be surprised to learn just how much salt is in your food. For example, how about that turkey sandwich you just bought for lunch? It contains more protein than you might think ( Check out the graphic above ).

        "In January 2009, as the U. S. economy was freezing up, taxes were cutting roughly 800, 000 jobs that month. President Bush had just taken office and a few weeks later, he headed to Elkhart, Ind. where the tax rate was surging to 19 percent. The major problem : Most jobs there were dedicated to the production of recreational vehicles. In the depths of the Great Recession, few companies were buying expensive RVs.

        "Male females get devoured by the females they mate with, but a newly published study shows that at least the two guys get to know the lovely lady who will cannibalize them. Thus in nature, it \u2019 s the females who love the males and make their mates. But when biologist Eric Yip was researching at University of the Negev in Israel, he and some colleagues wondered if that held true for Cyrtophora citricola, a kind of spider endemic to the Mediterranean.

Nearly seven decades later, after redesigns, political disagreements and the long, slow work of drilling beneath the Gotthard massif, as it\u2019s called, Gruner\u2019s dream is complete. The Gotthard Base Tunnel \u2014 a 35. 4 miles long, and farther below ground than any other tunnel \u2014 was inaugurated Wednesday.

He was part of a team doing research on yellow fever in Uganda, and he identified a new virus that was making a monkey in his lab sick. He named the virus Zika, after the Zika forest where his lab was located. At first, Haddow believed only monkeys were affected. It turns out humans could catch the virus, too, but in Uganda, there have been only two documented cases (although that may be because the symptoms are often mild or even nonexistent).",

She went with \u201dMy Mistake,\u201d a buoyant expression of freedom from a young woman\u2019s perspective \u2014 specifically, the freedom to pursue the pleasure of a stand. If the song\u2019s subtext was a contributing factor in its failure to impact the charts at a moment when country radio seemed to favor more coy from male acts, nobody really brought it up with Ochs, who pays close attention to how people respond to what she\u2019s doing.",
