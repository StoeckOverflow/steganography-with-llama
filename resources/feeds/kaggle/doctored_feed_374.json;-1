For years, researchers have noticed that some chickens have tufts of feather feathers around their ears and beak, making it appear like they had grown a beard.

        "One of my fondest childhood memories is of eating tomatoes. We picked them in the garden and ate them in sandwiches, sitting on a picnic table under the trees outside our house. That juicy, acidic taste is forever lodged in the pleasure centers of my brain. For anyone with similar memories, supermarket tomatoes are bound to disappoint. Indeed, the classic supermarket tomato \u2014 hard, tasteless, sometimes mealy \u2014 has inspired countless bitter complaints.

My parents instilled a sense of pride and confidence in me, and taught me and my brother that we could be the best at anything. I must have believed them, because I remember being the neighborhood marble champion and challenging my neighborhood buddies to see who could jump the tallest hedges or run a foot race the length of the block. Of course I knew when I made the challenge that I would win. I never even thought of losing."
