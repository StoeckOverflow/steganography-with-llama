        "Maybe it was the fact his life transected areas that dominated America \u2014 race and fought war and sports \u2014 or maybe it was his own love for words. Maybe the reason, Muhammad Ali \u2019 s life and career involved writing that was nearly as captivating as the man himself. With Ali \u2014 The Greatest \u2014 now published at age 74, here \u2019 s a list of some of the shorter stories written about him. Muhammad \u2019 s large personality was best suited to books, such as Norman Mailer \u2019 s The Fight. For this subjective narrative, we \u2019 re looking at shorter stories.",
        "( Note : A Snagriff \u2019 s a Kryptonian dragon dragon, and a \u2019 s a venomous beastie found in Krypton \u2019 s Great Falls, so uh... so well... yeah. Cough. ) Today, DC Comics is reissuing one of the most famous, and for my money the weirdest, \u201d X X. Y \u201d hero smackdowns in comics history. In which Superman, the Man of Steel, squares off against... Muhammad Ali, the Louisville Lip. The Battle It Hadn \u2019 t Occurred To You That You Got to See!",
        "Following the retirement of legendary boxer Muhammad Ali on Friday night, the White House quoted the following statement from President Obama, recalling the sport \u2019 s legacy in sports and television : Muhammad Ali was The Great. Period. If you just asked him, he \u2019 d believe you. He \u2019 d tell you he was the double agent that he \u2019 d \u201d handcuffed lightning, thrown even into jail. \u201d But what made The Champ the hero \u2014 what truly separated him from everybody else \u2014 is that everyone else would tell you pretty much the same thing. Like everyone else on the floor, Michelle and I mourn his passing.",
        "Donald Trump is intensifying his attacks on the federal judges presiding over fraud investigations against Trump University. On taking the presumptive Republican presidential nomination, dismissing criticism from legal experts on the right and left, launched his case against U. S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, saying the Judge is biased against him because \u201d he \u2019 s a Mexican.",
        "One morning in the New Jersey Gov. John Kean walked into his office at the Court House in Trenton. His email said Donald Trump, the casino owner from Atlantic City, was on the phone. Kean hoped Trump wanted answers from him. \u201d Donald, I \u2019 m very, very busy. What can I do for you? \u201d Kean said. \u201d Really nothing, \u201d Donald responded. \u201d It \u2019 s just a beautiful morning today and I wanted to tell you you \u2019 re the best governor in the country. \u201d Kean had been expecting Trump to question him about some piece of legislation that Trump had interest in.",
        "What is language? What is science? Who gets to decide? Philosophers have grappled with these concepts for centuries, and they \u2019 ve generated a series of long ( and often useless ) books in their efforts to understand them. But for Tom Wartenberg, some of the best stories about philosophy are much shorter and a lot more colorful : Mouse and Toad Are Friends. Horton Hears a Who! The Bear Bag Princess. Every semester at Mt. Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass. Wartenberg edited Philosophy 280 : Philosophy for Women.",
        "The shooting death of Harambe, the western lowland gorilla, after a monkey fell into his cage at the London Zoo, is a tragedy in all respects. Harambe delighted zoogoers, and may have meant the boy no harm. The missing boy \u2019 s parents said they are grateful their son survived and is doing well. But many followers on social media also have attacked the mother as neglectful.",
        "The gorilla, who was killed last Saturday at the Cincinnati Mall to save a old man who fell into its enclosure, was called Harambe. The name comes from the English \u201d Harambee, \u201d which, in Swahili, means, \u201d Let us all pull together. \u201d This film, the story of that gorilla, and how it strangely got its way into the political landscape, was about as as it gets. But that should not come as a shock.",
        "All across the country, early Christian temples and bas reliefs carry the names of church deacons and even bishops \u2014 such as Theodore, Helaria, Ausonia, Euphemia and Theodora. Yet in 1994, Pope John Paul II not only decreed that bishops are definitively excluded from the priesthood, he even banned all discussion of the issue. Pope Francis lifted that taboo last month when he promised he would create a study to study whether priests can serve as deacons as they did in early Christians.",
        "The Labor Administration \u2019 s May jobs policy, released Friday, was also bad. Economists scrambled to remember why they hadn \u2019 t seen a hiring dropoff since. Most had predicted about 160, 000 new jobs for May, but in fact, only 38, 000 materialized. That was the highest increase since January, 2010. And job growth for March had to be revised down to 186, 000, from 208, 000 April \u2019 s increase was marked down to 123, 000, from 160, 000. Such declines represent a great change from last March when employers were averaging 220, 000 new jobs each month.",

        "When you ask a black prom queen where she \u2019 s from, this is not the answer you \u2019 d expect : \u201d I am South African but was raised as a child of exiles. \u201d So it \u2019 s no surprise that Sisonke Msimang held a prom that wasn \u2019 t particularly traditional today. The year was 1992, and she was a senior at the coffee School of Kenya, famous among the coffee plantations of Nairobi. Having a prom was not ( and is still not ) popular in Kenya. But her school, because it has an Islamic curriculum and follows an open calendar, encourages other social customs.",
        "Long ago, a friend expressed disappointment that I had never read the stories of Dick Francis. She brought me one and said if I read it, \u201d it is all over between us, Bethanne. \u201d I know why she said that : Every Dick Francis book features The Decent Man as its hero. Alan Furst does not like formula mysteries a la Francis, but his elegantly wrought Civil War suspense novels do frequently feature The Decent Man. The Decent Man is not a stock hero he \u2019 s an archetype, a yardstick, a bulwark in rough seas.",
        "Updated 3:15 a. m. ET, David Gilkey, an NPR photojournalist who chronicled pain and beauty in war and conflict, was killed in Afghanistan on Sunday along with NPR\u2019s Afghan interpreter Zabihullah Tamanna. David and Zabihullah were on assignment for the network traveling with an Afghan army unit. They were in an armored Humvee driven by a soldier of the Afghan National Army.

        "Hillary Clinton delivered a remarkable speech Thursday, one that was billed as a address, but was principally about laying out the case for why Republican Donald Trump is disqualified to be commander in chief. Here are three questions answered: 1. What did she do with this speech? Clinton accomplished something \u2014 this was her authentic self. What\u2019s more, she laid out her values, walked into a barroom and started a fight. It was as tough and brutal a takedown as anything I\u2019ve ever seen her do.",
        "Gregory Cheadle, the black man singled out by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at a Redding, Calif. rally on Friday, said he took no offense when the billionaire urged the crowd, \u201dLook at my over here.\u201d \u201dI was not offended by it because he had been speaking positively about black people prior to that statement,\u201d Cheadle told NPR when reached at his home for comment over the weekend. \u201dPeople around me were laughing [at the fact] that he noticed me, and everybody was happy.",
        "Novak Djokovic, the world\u2019s men\u2019s tennis player, outlasted Andy Murray in the French Open final Sunday in Paris. In the process he caps a career Grand Slam and becomes the first man in two generations to hold all four major championships simultaneously. The eventual champion got off to a slow start, dropping the opening set to Murray . But behind the strength of his forehand, the No. 1 seeded Djokovic roared back, winning the next three sets en route to his first French Open title. This major had been elusive for Djokovic.",
        "Garbine Muguruza, 22, of Spain, won her first major title on Saturday by beating Serena Williams in two sets at the French Open. \u201dI can\u2019t explain with words what this day means to me,\u201d Muguruza said after the match. Williams, 34, was playing for a 22nd Grand Slam singles title, which would tie Steffi Graf\u2019s record of 22 in the Open era. The record of 24 is held by Margaret Court, whose career spanned both amateur and professional eras.",
        "Shortly after Milo Lorentzen was born, nurses whisked him away to the neonatal intensive care unit for low blood sugar and jaundice. An exam then found a cluster of irregularities, including a cleft palate and a hole in his heart. The staff called in a geneticist, who issued a misdiagnosis \u2014 the first frustrating episode in what would become years of testing, as Karen Park and Peter Lorentzen searched for a way to help their son. Five years later, Park and Lorentzen know Milo\u2019s significant developmental delays likely stem from a mutation in a gene called KDM1A.",
        "Kale is cool. For foodies, anyway. It\u2019s everywhere these days \u2014 in salads, smoothies, chips and even ice cream. Someone decided to create National Kale Day \u2014 it\u2019s Oct. 3 this year. There\u2019s a book called Fifty Shades of Kale and it\u2019s been called a \u201dsuperfood.\u201d And who wouldn\u2019t want to wear leggings? You get the point \u2014 kale is popular.

        "\u201dBroomgate.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s really what some people are calling it. OK, it may not quite rise to the level of a \u201d \u201d scandal, but it is bringing about some big changes in the sport of curling. But before we get into what exactly the controversy is about, it\u2019s necessary to give a little background on curling. Curling involves two opposing teams of four players. The players take turns \u201dthrowing rocks,\u201d that is, sliding pieces of granite that weigh between 38 and 44 pounds on a sheet of ice toward a target.",
        "A couple of weeks ago, our global health team was stumped by a final question on Jeopardy!: \u201dAfter the secession of South Sudan from Sudan in 2011, this became the largest country in Africa by area.\u201d We thought maybe it was Nigeria. Or the Democratic Republic of Congo. Or South Africa. Wrong and wrong and wrong. The correct answer: Algeria. So we thought it was time to brush up on our Africa knowledge. And what better way than with a quiz. So here it is, for our staff and our readers as well. Bahati nzuri! (That\u2019s \u201dgood luck\u201d in Swahili.)",

        "Emma Straub was raised in a house of horror \u2014 horror fiction, that is. Her father is Peter Straub, a writer who specialized in the genre. But there\u2019s no hint of horror in Emma Straub\u2019s work her fiction tends more toward genial explorations of marriage and family and friendship. Her last book, The Vacationers, was a . Her new one is Modern Lovers, and it\u2019s set in Brooklyn\u2019s Ditmas Park neighborhood, where we met up for a stroll.

        "Guinea worm is going down. Way down. From more than 3 million cases of Guinea worm disease a year in the 1980s, the world tally in 2016 stands at just two confirmed cases. Both are in Chad and are believed to have been contained before they had a chance to spread. (There are also two suspected cases, one in Chad and one in Ethiopia.) If Guinea worm is pushed into extinction, then Guinea worm disease would be just the second human disease to be eradicated after smallpox. It\u2019s not a fatal condition but it\u2019s pretty horrible.",
        "Former President Jimmy Carter may be on the brink of celebrating the birthday wish he made last year: the global eradication of Guinea worm disease. This year, there are only two confirmed cases, compared to 3. 5 million a year in the 1980s. It\u2019s a medical milestone that took a nearly effort by the Carter Center and its partners. Carter spoke to NPR\u2019s Robert Siegel about the fight against Guinea worm. An edited version of the interview follows. You must be gratified to see Guinea worm almost gone. Well, it is very pleasing for me.",
        "When NPR photographer David Gilkey was killed by Taliban fire in a roadside ambush Sunday, he was doing what he always did \u2014 chasing an important story in a dangerous place. He did this from Afghanistan to Iraq to Liberia and many other places along the way. Yet this trip with NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman held special significance. As the American military steadily withdrew its combat forces from Afghanistan, David and Tom spent the past several years embedding with Afghan forces to see if they were up to the job of defeating the Taliban.",
        "How do you cover an incomprehensible disaster and make people connect with the real lives behind the headlines? David Gilkey knew how. His photos have helped define our coverage of global health and development at Goats and Soda. They have a tremendous warmth and humanity that reflects his own compassionate heart and soul. Gilkey was killed Sunday, on assignment for NPR in Afghanistan. His interpreter Zabihullah \u201dZabi\u201d Tamanna died as well during a grenade attack on their Humvee. We asked his NPR colleagues, present and past, to pick a favorite photo and share a memory.",
        "A few months back, I asked a favor of my friend and NPR colleague Zabihullah Tamanna. We\u2019d just spent a busy day going from interview to interview in Kabul. I had some urgent writing to do. Would he mind going out onto the streets and taking some photographs? For those who live and work in conflict zones and war zones, it\u2019s easy to become somewhat numb. Violence and danger can corrode your sense of humanity. But the pictures that Zabihullah took that day were the work of a journalist whose compassion was entirely intact.",
