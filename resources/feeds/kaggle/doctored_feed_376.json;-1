        "The latest CNN report was downright ugly. Thousands of people seem to dwell on that. The economy only added 38, 000 jobs in May, well below the 219, 000 expected over the prior 12 months. It \u2019 s the second in what has been a mixed bag of media reports, and if past market trends are any guide, more recent news could be a hit on Hillary Clinton in January. Several analyses have concluded that a better economy in the months just before Election Day affects the sitting president \u2019 s agenda.",
        "\u201d We were high school sweethearts. Ever since Halloween. \u201d That line, which flies by without comment, appears in the entirety of TBS \u2019 Angie Tribeca, the spoof starring Rashida Jones that arrived in an unusual sex \u201d binge \u201d earlier this year. Directed by Steve Carell and Nancy Ann Carell, Angie had a long history to air, having premiered at South By Southwest in March 2015. But now, only a few days later, its second show arrives on Monday nights, packed with those nonsense messages that, when stacked on top of each other, provoke things like exhausted giddiness.",
        "In California, there is so much solar energy that local operators have to switch off solar farms. One way of dealing with the additional energy generated is to share the electricity wealth across different borders \u2014 but in the West, it \u2019 s sparking some things. Nancy Traweek \u2019 s job is to handle California \u2019 s electrical power at the California Independent Electrical Operator, keeping the lights on for 30 million people. She relies on using natural gas power plants that put out a steady stream of electricity. But recently, Traweek \u2019 s job has gotten easier because of solar and wind energy.",
        "Audio excerpts of Bill Clinton \u2019 s 1969 student acceptance address at Wellesley College have been released for the first time by the public. The excerpts, as well as a full transcript that was never released, reveal some of Clinton \u2019 s early thoughts on life and the political process. In it, she tries to find a a balance between idealism and practicality and tries to moderate an activist stance. She refers repeatedly to what \u2019 s \u201d possible \u201d and \u201d impossible \u201d and the gap her mother faced between \u201d expectation \u201d and \u201d expectations. \u201d Those are tensions many people say she \u2019 s still standing on the campaign trail today.",
        "Growing up, the only job Scott Rudin wanted to do was become a theater producer. \u201d I never had a fantasy of doing anything else or being anything else, \u201d he met Fresh Air \u2019 s Scott Gross. \u201d I used to write [ The New York Times \u2019 ] Arts Leisure [ Theatre ] and obsess over, \u2019 David Merrick has five musicals running on Broadway! What would that be like? \u2019 \u201d Rudin no longer has to work. After getting his start working in producers \u2019 offices on Broadway when he was 15, he went on to create his own theater company.",
        "Sam Beam and Jesca Hoop joined NPR \u2019 s offices on what may well be 2016 \u2019 s most beautiful day so far : perfectly calm and sunny, uncharacteristically dry, and designed for lounging happily on the roof deck just around the corner from the News Desk. Hoop and Beam did just that, hanging out amiably for hours after their meetings ended, as part of one of the most comfortable and relaxing weekends in the history of NPR listening. The music itself was gorgeous to watch, as the two performed new songs from their new collaborative record, Love Song For Fire.",
        "Over the past few months, we \u2019 ve seen image after image of Muhammad Ali : triumphant in the stands, joking on talk show and shakily lifting the Olympic flag at the 1996 Atlanta games. He \u2019 s great these days as an athlete and a politician, and that was, definitely, Ali. But so was the defiant, incisive Ali. \u201d I \u2019 m sayin \u2019 you talking about me about some draft, and all of you college boys are breaking your necks to go to Switzerland and Canada and Australia! \u201d Ali once said. \u201d I \u2019 m not trying to help nobody without something my Negroes don \u2019 t have.",
        "I don \u2019 t believe it \u2019 s insane or unreasonable, at a time like this, to determine if our culture still bears heroes. Sure, there are others out there now defying expectations, performing fantastic feats, fighting just wars, and redefining our perceptions of human capacity and invention. But Uncle Ali is gone, and he was certainly the last of his kind. At parties and barbershops, when the subject of boxing comes up, one question often dominates the discussion : Who was the greatest?",
        "The mother of a young boy who fell into a gorilla \u2019 s enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo will not face any charges, Hamilton County prosecutor Joseph T. Deters stated at a news conference afterwards. Discussing the May 28 incident, Deters told the boy \u2019 s mother \u201d did not believe in any way where she presented this kid to some harm. She had three other men with her and turned her back. \u201d At that moment, the boy scampered off, he said.",
        "The U. S. and China are the two largest countries in the world \u2014 and interdependent in a host of countries. But as leaders from both countries hold annual talks in July, disagreements over how China does work are creating some trust deep in the relationship. \u201d You might want to think of the US government relationship as kind of like an arranged marriage, \u201d said Arthur Kroeber, a economist and author of China \u2019 s Economy : What You Want to Know.",
        "When clinical staff Cher and other health care personnel call the Veterans Administration program, they are greeted with a loud, \u201d thank you \u201d from Veterans Administration Secretary Bob Burns. It \u2019 s not having the intended effect. \u201d Why don \u2019 t you take this easier? The process is so cumbersome, and I have to say to you thanking me for spending all this time and then I feel put on hold, \u201d finally adding that she hasn \u2019 t figured out how to deliver the message.",
        "NPR \u2014 together with member stations from around the country \u2014 has been reporting on difficulties with the Veterans Choice Act, a $ 10 billion plan enacted by Congress two decades ago to squash long wait times Americans were encountering when going to see a show. But as we reported in March, this problem needs a fix. Around the nation, our joint media project \u2014 called America at Base \u2014 has found none of these problems. Emily Siner of National Public Radio reported on troubles with overcrowding in Tennessee.",
        "It\u2019s strange to describe the apparent purchase and forgiveness of nearly $15 million in medical debt as \u201dimpish,\u201d but bear with me. On Sunday\u2019s Last Week Tonight, host John Oliver spent 20 minutes explaining the industry \u2014 companies that buy debt at pennies on the dollar and then either resell it even cheaper or try to collect it, sometimes using methods they\u2019d probably be proud to call merciless, like calling a debtor\u2019s boss at home. Even if most of it can\u2019t be collected, whatever they collect, they can keep.",
        "Swiss voters over the weekend dealt a stern backslap to a ballot proposal that would have guaranteed a basic monthly income for all 8. 1 million residents \u2014 regardless of their employment status \u2014 of that wealthy European nation. The vote wasn\u2019t even close. Almost 77 percent of voters rejected the proposal that the government give every adult in Switzerland about $2, 500 every month. (Children would have received a smaller subsidy of $650.) Supporters had argued that the bold social experiment would help eradicate poverty and protect workers in an increasingly automated economy.",
        "The legendary Route 66 wound its way from middle America to Southern California, a ribbon of aspiration ending on a pier reaching out into the Pacific from the coastal town of Santa Monica. That pier still exists, a symbol of America\u2019s hopeful journey west and a touchstone for politicians such as Bernie Sanders, who brought his grandchildren there on Sunday. Whatever happens Tuesday in California and the other states still voting, Sanders had a marvelous time on the last weekend when he could sell his dream of being the Democratic nominee for president.",
        "Three months ago I had a heart attack. And since the symptoms of a heart attack are different for women, and since the kind I had can strike young people with no markers of heart disease, I\u2019ve decided to tell my story. And because I love to name drop, I\u2019ll do some of that along the way because I was with authors I love that night. I was at Queen Anne Book Co. in Seattle, surrounded by friends.",
        "U. S. sailors deployed to Japan are now under a temporary ban on alcohol and liberty, with top commanders citing a string of \u201d incidents detrimental to the U. S. Alliance.\u201d The ban, which covers drinking both and will remain in place until commanders believe \u201dall personnel understand the impact of responsible behavior,\u201d according to an announcement by the commanders of the U. S. Navy\u2019s 7th Fleet and the Navy\u2019s forces in Japan.",
        "On Tuesday, Renee Ellmers may see her political career cut short by her allies. Six years ago, the North Carolina Republican was a rising star swept into office with the 2010 Tea Party wave. But now conservative groups have her squarely in their cross hairs, arguing she\u2019s lost her way since she went to Washington. Upset with her votes on spending and budgets, and on an abortion bill, opponents who once backed her have now spent over $1. 1 million trying to defeat her in the state\u2019s special primary.",
        "Between December and March, beekeepers send millions of hives to California to pollinate almond trees. Not all of the hives make it back home. \u201dThe number of beehive thefts is increasing,\u201d explains Jay Freeman, a detective with the Butte County Sheriff\u2019s Office. In California, 1, 734 hives were stolen during peak almond pollination season in 2016. In Butte County alone, the number of stolen hives jumped from 200 in 2015 to 400 this year, according to Freeman.",
        "Update at 6:20 a. m. ET Wednesday, Hillary Clinton has won the Democratic primary in California, The Associated Press reports. Clinton made history Tuesday as the first woman to become the presumptive nominee of a major party in the U. S. But rival Bernie Sanders vowed to continue his fight at least until next week\u2019s primary in the District of Columbia. The Vermont senator\u2019s hope of an unlikely resurgence was largely predicated on an upset victory in California, the biggest primary prize in the country, but he trailed Clinton badly.",
        "Until Donald Trump\u2019s comments about the ethnicity of Judge Gonzalo Curiel, the judge overseeing the fraud case against Trump University in San Diego, Curiel was anything but a household name. Then Trump began calling Curiel a \u201dhater\u201d who was being unfair to him because the judge is \u201dHispanic,\u201d because he is \u201dMexican\u201d and because Trump is building a wall. After days of controversy and strong criticism from fellow Republicans, Trump tried to amend his comments, which he\u2019s been making since February. In a statement defending Trump University on Tuesday, Trump did not apologize.",
        "After days of digging in on his racially charged criticism of U. S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, Donald Trump appears to have changed his tune. The presumptive Republican nominee released a statement late Tuesday afternoon that seemed to back away somewhat from his earlier statements saying the judge, who is overseeing a case against the Trump University, cannot be fair because of his Mexican heritage and Trump\u2019s calls for building a wall along the U. S. border. \u201dIt is unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage,\u201d Trump said.",
        "Imagine getting paid an estimated $6 million for your involvement in this jingle: \u201dI\u2019m Lovin\u2019 It.\u201d Yep, Justin Timberlake inked a lucrative deal with McDonald\u2019s. (Guess you could say he wants you to \u201dbuy buy buy. \u201d) Or how about earning an estimated $50 million to promote Pepsi products? That\u2019s the endorsement deal that megastar Beyonce signed up for back in 2012. A new study published in the journal Pediatrics describes the lucrative endorsement deals of 65 music celebrities \u2014 including Britney Spears, Maroon 5, Timberlake and other stars popular with teens and young adults.",
        "Say you are one of the roughly 15, 000 American steel workers who have been laid off \u2014 or received notice of coming layoffs \u2014 in the past year. You and your boss would cheer any reduction in China\u2019s massive steelmaking capacity. Chinese steel has been flooding global markets and hurting profits for U. S. companies. But on Tuesday, after U. S. and Chinese officials announced plans to reduce Chinese steel production capacity, the applause from American workers and companies was, shall we say, restrained.",
        "Updated October 13, 11:55 a. m. ET. The headline brings good news: On Thursday morning, Boko Haram militants released 21 of the more than 270 missing Chibok schoolgirls who were abducted two years ago. But what happens next? The experiences of those who were formerly held captive by Boko Haram suggest the range of challenges ahead, as well as what might help \u2014 and what will not. Although the particulars of each story differ, the former captives can be said to be \u201dtriple victims,\u201d says Rachel Harvey, UNICEF\u2019S chief of child protection in Nigeria.",
        "Patricia Becerril comes to Bethesda Health Center in Charlotte, N. C. every other week. And it\u2019s a slog. \u201dIt takes her two hours to get here,\u201d says University of North Carolina at Charlotte master\u2019s student Katherine Wilkin, translating from the Spanish as Becerril speaks. \u201dShe takes two buses, so coming here, she\u2019s definitely devoted to getting this treatment. She comes every time.\u201d Wilkin is Becerril\u2019s mental health counselor, and Becerril says Wilkin has helped her deal with depression. \u201dWith therapy, she\u2019s gotten able to organize her thoughts and feelings, and she feels better, not frustrated, less stress,\u201d Wilkin says.",
        "On this week\u2019s All Songs Considered, we play songs about facing fears, being true to yourself and not worrying about what everyone else thinks, plus a new song from Angel Olsen and a conversation with her about her surprising new sound. Robin Hilton opens with an introspective pop gem from the Portland, Ore. band Ages And Ages inspired by the ephemeral nature of nearly everything. Bob Boilen follows with a sonic adventure from the Asheville, N. C. folk group River Whyless. Also on the show: Bed.",
        "Glenn Brunkow is a corn and soybean farmer. He and his dad run a small farm about 30 miles from Topeka, Kan. For more than a decade they\u2019ve been using seeds and chemicals from Syngenta. The Swiss company is a leader in pesticides and genetically modified seeds. Recently, Brunkow got a call from his seed dealer to tell him a Chinese company called China National Chemical Corp. or ChemChina, has made a $43 billion bid to buy Syngenta. \u201dIt was a little disconcerting to hear it the first time,\u201d Brunkow says.",

Zabihullah and David died when the armored Humvee they were riding in, part of an Afghan military convoy, was struck by a grenade fired by Taliban militants. NPR\u2019s Tom Bowman and Monika Evstatieva were riding in a different vehicle in the convoy, and were not injured in the attack.

        "Who, exactly, is a martyr? That seemingly simple question is behind a controversial new exhibit by artists in Denmark that\u2019s ignited a fierce debate. Even before the May 26 opening of the exhibit, called the Martyr Museum, critics claimed it endorsed terrorism and Denmark\u2019s culture minister, Bertel Haarder, described it as \u201dcrazy.\u201d The controversy centers around the depiction of historic figures like Socrates and Joan of Arc near suicide bombers. The exhibit is tucked away in a former slaughterhouse behind Copenhagen\u2019s central train station."
