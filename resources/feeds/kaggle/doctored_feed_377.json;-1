On a perfect spring evening, a family gather here, put on work gloves and begin cutting up weeds from the perennial field where chives, strawberries, rhubarb and sage are in various stages of growth. \u201d I didn \u2019 t know how responsible I [ would ] become for physical work, \u201d says culinary education major Heidi Engelhardt.

As her kids play, she keeps a constant watch on their breathing. She thinks asthma is in her genes. \u201d You have a family, a wife who has four kids, and all of them have it, trust me, \u201d she says. \u201d And then my mom has it, and my dad \u2019 s two kids. \u201d A teenage girl, Jhase, runs over to her, wheezing.

Aamodt \u2019 s neuroscientific take on why diets backfire is that divisive. Aamodt is a neuroscientist, book writer and former editor of a national brain research project. She also has become a prominent evangelist of the message that traditional diets just don \u2019 t exist and often leave the dieter lower off than before. And she \u2019 s an enthusiastic proponent of mindful feeding. \u201d I define it as eating with warmth and joy, without hesitation, \u201d Aamodt said in an interview.",

With need for donated livers far outstripping others, patients may spend months or years on a regular waitlist, their position in the line eventually improving as they get sicker. A recent study suggests that this lifestyle may be changing, but not necessarily for the better.",

Bites from these bugs are more dangerous to us than those of any other animal mosquitoes kill tens of thousands of people each year worldwide, and sicken millions more. True mosquitoes don \u2019 t bite people, but when the flies drink our blood to create their eggs, they can leave behind viruses and parasites that cause disease like West Africa, malaria, dengue and Zika.",
        "So what makes things great? Well, we can start off with poop : human poop, horse poop, all manner of poop. In general we don \u2019 t have a lot of poop on our minds \u2014 and that is a very good thing. How we adapt to this enlightened, state is, however, a matter that might enlighten our own angry people. Recently, I \u2019 ve been watching \u201d How We Walk To Now. \u201d It is a wonderful series from a number of years ago, made by Steven Johnson.",

        "It \u2019 s easy to tell that evolution led us to modern humans, the cleverest of apes. But there were some great excursions along the way. See, for example, the Hobbits. That \u2019 s the nickname for a close relative that once lived in what is now Borneo. A new discovery suggests that it was island life that killed this dainty creature. Anthropologists first found the bones of the Hobbits in 2004 on the Indonesian island of Flores. Their scientific name is Homo floresiensis. They were with tiny brains and long arms, but they had stone legs and teeth much like ours.",

Eliot, \u201dnot with a bang but a whimper.\u201d It may be said that the world of 2016 presidential nominating contests is ending with a bit of a bang and a whimper. Six states held primaries or caucuses on the last big Tuesday (only the District of Columbia remains to vote on June 14) and the results closed out the season with an exclamation point and a question mark \u2014 for each of the remaining three candidates. On the most obvious plane, it was Hillary Clinton\u2019s night.",

        "A relationship drama with societal implications, Desde All\u00e1 (From Afar) hails from afar \u2014 specifically, from Venezuela \u2014 and marks a striking debut for writer director Lorenzo Vigas. His method is to draw you in by holding you at a slight remove \u2014 a habit he seems to have picked up from its leading man. Armando (Alfredo Castro, tamping down his considerable charisma) is a man you might not notice if you saw him on the street. Grey, nondescript. He lives alone, and spends his days making dentures.

        "A powerful new technique for changing genes in insects, animals and plants holds great promise, according to a report from an influential panel of scientists released Wednesday. But the group also says it\u2019s potentially very dangerous. As such, the report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine concludes that it\u2019s far too soon to release any organisms altered with the technique, known as a gene drive, into the environment. Even so, scientists should continue conducting experiments using this approach inside laboratories, the report urges.",

        "When two armed men burst into a McDonald\u2019s in Besancon, France, on Sunday, it\u2019s safe to say they chose the wrong franchise for a stickup. French police say the men in their 20s fired a warning shot and cleaned out the registers of about 2, 000 euros ($2, 280).
