All seven of our selections for May 2016 display the tempos in the 120s or above, ranging from the ecstatic screams of the Brazilian Mainline to the tribal polyrhythms of Lisbon \u2019 s DJ Marfox. Until the next dose, you can join us on Twitter at @ El _ Yenigun ( Sami ) @ raspberryjones ( Piotr ) and @ spotieotis ( Otis ) for our next selections.",
        "British officials on June 23 will cast what some have termed the most important ballot of their choosing \u2014 whether the U. N. should remain in the European Union or pull out, in what \u2019 s become colloquially known as a \u201d Brexit. \u201d There \u2019 s been a blizzard of claims from both supporters and opponents of exiting the euro, and while most polls show a lead at the moment, the number of undecided votes is high.",
        "The Food and Drug Administration has reduced an inch from its compassionate use policy, streamlining information that physicians must undergo to obtain experimental medications for patients with illnesses. Doctors will now make an application for FDA approval that contains just 11 questions, 15 fewer than the old form. They should be able to complete this new format in 45 minutes, the FDA suggests. The new form is significant because it was designed for individual use, replacing an format that had been adopted by doctors acting on behalf of individuals or groups of people.",
        "I \u2019 m hanging out with my roommate in the early evening, attempting to keep her entertained and eat dinner together, when my phone buzzes. Normally I \u2019 d feel responsible for checking it immediately, and probably even if I didn \u2019 t. But this time it \u2019 s not a contact mention or an email from my boyfriend. It \u2019 s a timely suggestion from an app called Muse. Here \u2019 s what it says : \u201d start playing \u2019 Simon Says \u2019 with words, using directional signs like : behind, front, between. ( ex. \u2019 Simon Says stand between the chairs. \u2019 ) \u201d So we do. It \u2019 s a ton of fun.",
        "Theresa Saldana, an author and victims advocate, died Monday in Los Angeles at the age of 61. She worked in movies such as I Wanna Hold Your Hand and Raging Bull. In 1982, she was stabbed 10 times outside her West Hollywood apartment by a man who had become obsessed with her. She survived the incident, and the man was convicted of attempted murder. But Saldana told police the man continued calling her disturbing, threatening calls. As a way to cope with the situation, she turned to other victims of past crimes.",
        "In the 23 years that Starflyer 59 has been a success, the only constant has been Jason Martin. But in those same two decades, through several styles \u2014 from the heavy shoegaze of Black and Gold to Americana \u2019 s classic style to the poppier run of The Fashion Show through Leave Here A Stranger, and so on and so forth \u2014 you always know a band is a Jason Martin favorite. His workmanlike approach puts an edge on songs that make sense and are built to last.",
        "Late last year, when most people were getting ready for the holidays, physicists at the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) machine at CERN, the European Association for Nuclear Research, issued a startling announcement : Their highly massive detectors had identified a significant bump in the data with an uncertainty level of about 750 GeV. This level is about four times larger than the ones associated with the Higgs particle.",
        "The Clinton campaign was about to release a video with Barack Obama endorsing Hillary Clinton when the candidate called in for a short interview with NPR. In that interview, Clinton said she was \u201d thrilled \u201d to have the president \u2019 s endorsement and looks forward to campaigning with him. The relationship dropped shortly after Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders met with Obama at the White House. Sanders told reporters he looked forward to meeting with Clinton personally to discuss how they can work together to defeat Republican Donald Trump.",
        "Two years after Hillary Clinton garnered enough delegates to be the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party, Barack Obama endorsed Obama on Thursday in a video. The women will campaign together next week in Wisconsin. \u201d I need to congratulate Hillary Clinton on political history, \u201d Obama says in the video. \u201d I know how important this job can be. That \u2019 s why I know Hillary will be so good at it.",
        "Sharon Belvin \u2019 s involvement with cancer began in 2004, when she was just 22. Belvin was an experienced runner but said she soon found she couldn \u2019 t climb the mountain without \u201d a lot of effort breathing. \u201d Eventually, after months of fruitless treatments for lung ailments including bronchitis, she was diagnosed with melanoma \u2014 a very serious skin cancer. It had already spread to her lungs, and the prognosis was grim. She had about a week of surviving the next nine months. \u201d Yeah, that was the main point of life, getting there, \u201d she says.",
        "In 1975, I was living in San Diego and needed a roommate. The roommate of a friend of mine was a scientist at Scripps Clinic and Science Foundation. He said a friend of his was looking to hire a genetic technician, so I applied and got the job. The scientist I worked for was some guy from a small city in Texas. His name? James Allison. Jim has developed a new kind of genetic therapy that enables people \u2019 own immune systems to ward off their disease.",
        "Tom Perkins, one of Silicon Valley \u2019 s first venture capitalists, resigned this week. The New York Times reported on CBS that the financier died at 84 at home in Tiburon, Calif. of natural causes. The firm he named Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers, confirmed the case to NPR. Perkins and granted Kleiner a venture capital partnership in 1972 \u2014 \u201d at a time when parts of Silicon Valley were still productive fruit orchards, \u201d as the newspaper points out.",
        "Note : Billboard \u2019 s First Listen album comes down after the album is done. However, you can still go with the Spotify playlist at the bottom of the page. It \u2019 s hard to imagine a whole that might exceed the sum of these albums. Neko Case, k. d. lang and John Veirs have little to prove yet \u2014 they \u2019 ve each made vital, emotionally gripping music throughout their careers, which in lang \u2019 s case takes more than three decades \u2014 so their future supergroup is bound to seem, at least on paper, like halfway between a lark and a victory lap.",
        "A federal district court in California ruled today that local jurisdictions have the right to require persons to obtain permits before carrying concealed weapons in court. In a decision, the 9th U. S. District Court of Appeals found that the Second Amendment right to bear arms does not include carrying a concealed weapon. The ruling upholds a California handgun ownership law, one of the toughest in the country. The opinion is binding only in the five states covered by the 9th Circuit ( Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington ).",
        "United Nations Ban made a startling admission Thursday, saying he bowed to pressure over a report that blasted Saudi Arabia for child casualties that have resulted from its bombing campaign in Yemen. Ban called it one of the most difficult choices he had to face. The U. N. report on children in armed conflict worldwide describes, in Ban\u2019s words, \u201dthe horrors no child should have to face.\u201d The report held Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners responsible for about half of the attacks on schools and hospitals and 60 percent of the nearly 2, 000 children killed and injured.",
        "A lot can change in eight years. Back in 2008, Barack Obama helped keep Hillary Clinton out of the White House. Now he\u2019s endorsing her bid for president. And he is likely to be one of her best campaign weapons. \u201dI\u2019ve gotten to know Hillary really well,\u201d the president told Glenn Thrush on a Politico podcast. \u201dShe is a good, smart, tough person who cares deeply about this country.\u201d That\u2019s what he says now. The two were a lot less chummy in the winter of 2008, when they waged a bitter primary battle.",
        "What does helping a control her temper tantrums have to do with reducing global poverty? Quite a lot, says Dana McCoy. A professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, McCoy is lead author of a study that offers a rare look at how well toddlers across the world\u2019s 132 and countries are mastering five core skills \u2014 including maintaining attention, following simple directions, getting along with others and controlling aggressive behavior like kicking and hitting.",
        "Updated at 12:44 p. m. ET, President Obama met with Bernie Sanders on Thursday morning at the White House. Now that Hillary Clinton has clinched the Democratic nomination, the question on the minds of many Democrats is when the Vermont senator will give up his fight for the party\u2019s presidential nomination. Speaking at the White House after the meeting, Sanders reiterated that he would compete in the D. C. primary next Tuesday and take his campaign issues to the July Democratic National Convention. He also affirmed his commitment to working on issues of income inequality.",
        "To an outsider, the culture at Pied Piper, the fictional tech company featured in the HBO comedy series Silicon Valley, might seem a little odd. Not only do the company\u2019s employees live and work together in an \u201dincubator,\u201d they also get into biting arguments about the nuances of whether it\u2019s acceptable to type spaces instead of tabs when programming code. Alec Berg, who serves as showrunner along with creator Mike Judge, tells Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross that the quirky details viewers see on the show are inspired by real life.",
        "The Mars candy company brought MM\u2019s to Sweden in 2009. But the country already had a famous chocolate candy marked with an M \u2014 and now a court says MM\u2019s should melt from the market, owing to a trademark infringement.",
        "A group of 21 states is filing a lawsuit against the state of Delaware over the alleged mishandling of millions of dollars in unclaimed checks. The attorneys general of Arkansas and Texas, the states leading the suit, announced that the lawsuit will be filed sometime Thursday. Between $150 million and $400 million might be at stake, the attorneys general say. The suit centers on how Delaware handled uncashed and unclaimed checks sold by the money transfer service MoneyGram.",
        "Presidents and leading presidential candidates often arrange their financial affairs to prevent the appearance of financial conflicts of interest. But there\u2019s never been a major party nominee quite like Donald Trump. If he\u2019s elected president, he would bring to the White House a unique potential for conflicts of interest. The typical tool in such situations is a blind trust, but given Trump\u2019s unique circumstances, a blind trust might not be up to the task of preventing him from profiting from decisions he would make as president. What sorts of conflicts might Trump have?",
        "The woman leading the federal government\u2019s effort to block a North Carolina law that limits the rights of transgender people knows what it\u2019s like to feel like an outsider. Vanita Gupta, 41, is the child of immigrants who left India in search of better economic opportunity. That journey took her as a small child from a McDonald\u2019s in London where her family fled racial insults and french fries thrown by bigoted skinheads all the way to the Ivy League. For nearly two years now, Gupta has worked inside the government, leading the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights unit.",
        "It\u2019s time to update your copy of the periodic table. Four new elements discovered in recent years have now been named, pending final approval by the international group of scientists in charge of the table. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry has announced these proposed names: The new superheavy, radioactive elements were actually added to the periodic table late last year and given these temporary and unremarkable names: ununtrium, ununpentium, ununseptium and ununoctoium. But the IUPAC lets the discoverers of an element submit permanent names.",
        "WARNING: This post contains spoilers for last night\u2019s season finale of The Americans. Television showrunners love a surly teen. For decades, the American drama has teemed with peevish adolescents who slam doors and storm and stomp and sneer and seethe and sulk before hurling themselves performatively onto the nearest piece of furniture. It\u2019s understandable, to some degree: Writers want audiences to relate to their characters, and if the Surly Teen is a staple of American television, it is an fixture of American households.",
        "feet up in the Colombian Andes, in the province of Boyac\u00e1, a little orange schoolhouse sits on a hillside dotted with flowers. students, ages 4 through 11, walk as much as an hour to get here from their families\u2019 farms. The students greet reporters in English \u2014 \u201dWelcome! Welcome!\u201d \u2014 and Spanish, with a song and a series of performances. In one, an in a green school uniform and a colorful feather mask recites a folk tale about a terrible, monster called a Mohan. It\u2019s a charming presentation, but it\u2019s more than that.",
        "Philadelphia became the first major U. S. city to impose a tax on sugary drinks after its City Council voted on June 16 to approve a 1. 5 surcharge on soda and other sweetened beverages. Here is our original post from June 9: What\u2019s included in the proposed new tax? Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney had originally proposed a tax on sugary drinks including soda, sweetened teas, sports drinks and other beverages that contain added sugars. The proposal now on the table reduces the tax to 1.",
        "Women who want an abortion in deeply conservative Texas have slightly more choice these days than they had a few months ago. In March, the Food and Drug Administration simplified rules on abortion medication, allowing patients to take the standard regimen of abortion drugs later in a pregnancy. However, the recent spike in the number of women choosing legal, abortions in U. S. clinics has not slowed brisk sales of abortion drugs south of the border, in Mexican pharmacies.",
        "It\u2019s odd to view the O. J. Simpson trial in a renewed cultural spotlight today, 22 years after the murders and 21 years after the verdicts, almost in defiance of our tendency to observe anniversaries. But between FX\u2019s The People vs. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story earlier this year and now Ezra Edelman\u2019s 7 documentary O. J.: Made In America, we are not observing a milestone, but attempting an almost convulsive reckoning with every open or tenuously bound wound the case touched and still touches: racism and sexism, certainly. Class distinctions, especially where they intersect with race.",
        "Syrian President Bashar Assad is sounding rather confident these days. In his first major address in the past two months, he promised that his troops will reclaim \u201devery inch\u201d of Syrian territory. \u201dWe have no other choice but to be victorious,\u201d Assad told Syria\u2019s parliament on Tuesday. He also lashed out at rebels, blaming them for the failure of peace talks backed by the United Nations. Assad\u2019s speech is calling into question international diplomacy on Syria. One at the Atlantic Council in Washington, Faysal Itani, says it\u2019s time to go back to the drawing board."
