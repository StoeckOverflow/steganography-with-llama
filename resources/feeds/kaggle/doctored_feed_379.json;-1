        "Maybe everybody \u2019 s fair in love and peace. While the San Jose Sharks and the Pittsburgh Penguins participate in the Stanley Cup playoffs this week, museums from each country are wagering pieces from their collection that their best team will come out on time. It all started on May 27, when the Cleveland Museum of Art in Anaheim challenged the San Jose Museum of Art to a charity bet on Twitter.

        "Like the other 4 dozen or so visitors expected to see around Yellowstone National Park this summer, we had come to collect the bison. And we found them. Hulking, shaggy, majestic, nibbling on fresh wild grass, their tails swishing. At our familiar and respectful distance, my family waited quietly in awe. And then, being the people, Americans that we are \u2014 we were suddenly discovered.

        "Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton both made speeches in Washington on themes aimed at firing up their ideological bases that they \u2019 ll need to meet come November.

        "Women, as a bloc, are predominantly Democratic voters. But under that broad gender umbrella, there \u2019 s a bit of nuance. White women actually support the Republican nominee for president. And this is particularly true of white, suburban, white women. In fact, Barack Obama lost two women by 14 points ( 56 percent to 42 percent ) in the 2012 election, compared to exit poll projections. Shrinking that gap is key to Hillary Clinton \u2019 s plan to win the White House, intended to offset any potentially lower Democratic turnout among young voters.",

        "It\u2019s a job where the hours are long, you\u2019re constantly traveling, and the pay, frankly, stinks. On top of that, there are people doing pretty much what you do \u2014 except their jobs, the money, the benefits, the perks are astronomically better. And yet, the people who do that first job do it willingly. Such is life in pro basketball\u2019s the minors of the NBA.

Dogs today, according to the study published in Science last week, are the result of the interbreeding of these two quite distinct populations from Europe and East Asia.
