        "The amendment guaranteeing female voting rights is almost 100 years old, but men have only recently become regulars in political parties \u2019 presidential primary fights. All those decades of liberal progress culminated this time in Hillary Clinton becoming the first woman who is the presumptive candidate of a major party. That unprecedented creep into presidential history reflects a larger diversity : Women make up a bigger share of national and international lawmakers than ever, and yet the percentage of women in major leadership positions remains disproportionately low.",
        "The jail sentence of Brock Turner, a fellow Stanford University student convicted of sexual assault last week, has created an outcry. Vice President Biden sent a letter of support for the case. California Attorney General Kamala Harris condemned the prison sentence. Now, an effort to remove Judge Aaron Persky, who put down that sentence, has begun. Let \u2019 s Scott Simon debates with Michele Dauber, the Stanford law professor who \u2019 s leading that effort, about why she thinks Judge Persky \u2019 s treatment is unacceptable, and why he deserves a pardon.",
        "Singer Nicole Grimmie, a former contestant on The Bachelor, was shot by a gunman after a concert in Jacksonville, Fla. police say, and later died of her wounds. Metropolitan Police have identified Grimmie \u2019 s husband as Kevin James Loibl. Grimmie was signing autographs for fans after the show at The Simpsons Live late night, according to a statement from Orlando police.

        "Shakespeare \u2019 s Romeo and Juliet has defined tragic young love for boys : Boy and girl from feuding relationships fall in love. Boy slays the girl \u2019 s cousin for losing his friend in a duel. Boy swallows a sleeping potion. Boy thinks she \u2019 s dead. Boy swallows fire. Girl wakes, sees boy dead, and stabs herself. They \u2019 re both brain dead. Families mourn and cry. But what if it didn \u2019 t have to be that way?",
        "A record percentage of Americans are dying by accident and increasingly because of fatal overdoses and abuse, and not so much in car accidents. A new report from the Transportation Safety Council said more than 136, 000 people in the U. S. die accidentally in 2014, the highest number ever recorded. That \u2019 s an increase of 4. 2 percent from the year before and 15. 5 percent more than a decade ago. The new accidental death trend is being fueled in large part by the opioid and heroin epidemic.",
        "Writing about the damn thing on the Internet one day after it explodes is either difficult, or extremely difficult. Sometimes a day can give answers, reveal some deeper insights, allow for edification that couldn \u2019 t have been found the day before. Or perhaps it can not. Perhaps this whole thing, this latest expansion of the Political Twitter Fan Complex, still makes no sense. Even so, here we are. We want to talk about # DeleteYourAccount, because everybody else is talking about it. And because 2016 is quickly marking the year of the Twitter burst. You must have seen it by now.",
        "Few people have the unusual set of professional experience that Lonny Shavelson does. He worked as an emergency medical physician in Berkeley, Calif. for years, while also working as a consultant. He has written several novels and takes hauntingly beautiful photographs. Now he \u2019 ll add another chapter. California \u2019 s End of Life Option Act, a law legalizing surgery for people who are terminally ill, took effect this week. Shavelson has become a consultant aimed at asking questions from physicians and researchers about the practice \u2014 and plans to send a physician to terminally ill patients seeking to end their illness.",
        "Shalimar the Clown is Salman Rushdie \u2019 s eighth novel. Published in 2005, it tells the story of a young man who wants revenge after he \u2019 s jilted by the love of his life. There \u2019 s intrigue, violence, and conflict between history and modern society \u2014 the sort of stuff that makes for grand opera. Now, Shalimar the Clown is just that. Adapted by composer Maya Perla and Pulitzer playwright Rajiv Sharma, the opera premieres tonight at Opera Theatre of Saint Paul. Rushdie says the novel comes from one tragic story.",
        "Screenwriter John Logan has worked on some big projects. From Skyfall to Gladiator, Logan has learned well how the movie business functions. So he knew his latest release, Genius, would be a tough deal. \u201d This movie is the worst sound pitch in the history of the genre, \u201d he admits. That \u2019 s because it \u2019 s about editing stuff. The idea began germinating in the 1980s, when John Logan read A. Michael Berg \u2019 s biography of Carl Perkins, the editor responsible for discovering Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald.",
        "On a busy Seoul street corner, students in tribal tunics, bare breasts and temporary facial expressions are taking part in an impromptu dance. The students, aboriginals at National Central University, line up and call out their names and the names of their students. Recounting their hardships, some of them weep. For a long time, including a woman named Yayut, she questioned her identity as an aborigine. \u201d When people saw I was an aborigine, they said, \u2019 You don \u2019 t look like one, \u2019 \u201d she says, proudly.

        "Not everybody \u2019 s talked about the bird. That \u2019 s the case dealing with some events in history. According to Ray Brown, who hosts the radio show and book Talkin \u2019 Birds, birds \u2014 or more recently, birdwatchers \u2014 have had prominent roles in a few incidents of espionage, murder and intrigue. Brown talked with NPR \u2019 s Paul Simon about these ornithological curiosities. During the Red Scare. Or maybe, A bird that can claim nomination to the U. S. House Intelligence Committee. It \u2019 s the prothonotary warbler.",
        "The most compelling scientific fiction is the sort which gives weight beyond its inherent inventiveness or even its ingenuity. It takes more. The guys in the genre have always looked like corner prophets born from the fringe. They succeed in telling us, in a vision uniquely their own, what could potentially remain of our planet should we continue down a different path. Which is not to say one shouldn \u2019 t devour the purely entertaining for its own sake. But surely the most evocative is the stuff of mug shots.",
        "Muhammad Ali kissed me once. Don\u2019t be a dope \u2014 it wasn\u2019t like that. It was in front of a whole bunch of people and my and Mrs. Ali. (And two of his future wives. I\u2019ll get to that in a moment.) I was lucky enough to meet him a few times over several decades, but the first time was the most memorable. It was my senior year in college. Ali was in Boston \u2014 probably on other business \u2014 and came to speak to Harvard\u2019s class of 1973.",

        "Tesla says its cars\u2019 suspension systems have no safety problems, and the maker calls an allegation that it has pressured customers not to report safety problems \u201dpreposterous.\u201d The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says it is looking into reports of a suspension system failure on Tesla\u2019s Model S vehicles. The New York Times reports that since October, NHTSA has received 33 complaints of suspension parts breaking.

        "A gunman opened fire on a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla. early Sunday morning, killing at least 50 people in the deadliest mass shooting in recent U. S. history before being shot dead by police. The suspected shooter has been identified by authorities as Omar Mateen, a U.

Though these instances of mass gun violence involved different attackers with different motives, all such events leave behind witnesses who have to find a way to understand what they\u2019ve seen and then move beyond it. On this week\u2019s For the Record: the survivors. NPR\u2019s Rachel Martin talks with two people who lived through shootings that still haunt them. Paul Temme of Prairie Village, Kan.",
        "At first, they say, it seemed like just part of the music. It was a Saturday night and the dance tracks had been pounding at the Pulse Orlando nightclub, which calls itself the city\u2019s hottest gay bar. A sharp, staccato sound, arriving shortly after 2 a. m. ET, didn\u2019t seem out of place. \u201dI thought it was a Ying Yang Twins song or something,\u201d Christopher Hansen told reporters.",
        "At blood banks in Orlando, Fla. lines stretched around the block as people waited, in some cases for hours, to donate blood in support of those wounded in a deadly attack at a local gay nightclub. But, as some people noted with frustration and anger, FDA restrictions currently bar sexually active gay and bisexual men from donating blood, leaving many members of the LGBT community unable to contribute.",

        "Lawmakers and presidential candidates swiftly responded to Sunday morning\u2019s shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando \u2014 the worst mass shooting in American history. While they were united in offering condolences to the victims and their communities, they disagreed on the shooter\u2019s motivation (which is still not definitively known) and potential solutions to prevent future mass shootings. President Obama spoke at the White House, said the attack was an \u201dact of terror and an act of hate\u201d and again stressed a need for stricter restrictions access to guns.",
        "The forest at Great Smoky Mountains National Park is sick, infected by invasive bugs and plants. Matt Moore, Kaleb Lique Naitove and Emily Baird of the National Park Service are some of the field medics trying to keep it alive. \u201dWe\u2019re out here trying to save trees,\u201d says Moore, a seasonal forestry tech, as he steps over downed logs and through thick patches of rhododendron on the Tennessee side of Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

        "Donald Trump has promised to speak Wednesday about, in his words, \u201dthe failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton.\u201d He had previously billed the speech, which was postponed after last week\u2019s Orlando shooting, as addressing \u201dall of the things that have taken place with the Clintons.\u201d Specifically, Trump had vowed to cover everything from what he calls the couple\u2019s \u201dpolitics of personal enrichment\u201d to Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server as secretary of state, which he argued was \u201ddesigned to keep her corrupt dealings out of the public record, putting the security of the entire country",
        "\u201dI mean no disrespect, but I am American of Mexican descent,\u201d I heard her say. I was having breakfast alone but I was absolutely drawn to the conversation going at the table next to me. Donald Trump\u2019s comments about a Latino federal judge have sparked discussion about racism and bias. But, here, at this hotel along the U. S. border, this group of employees were having an incredible conversation about how personal those comments felt. It was just another instance, they said, in which a Latino has had his American identity put under a microscope.",
        "Susan Phillips studies and writes about graffiti as an anthropologist. In 2000, while doing research for her book, Wallbangin\u2019: Graffiti and Gangs in LA, she stumbled upon some graffiti that stunned her. Under a bridge near the Los Angeles River, Phillips discovered what appeared to be markings \u2014 a practically extinct type of American hieroglyphics called hobo graffiti. The hobo graffiti was essentially very old examples of \u201dso and so was here,\u201d and dated back to 1914. Much of it was signed by hobos whose monikers have long been forgotten. But Phillips says one of them \u2014 .",
        "The June 23 referendum on whether the United Kingdom should leave the European Union has revealed one clear gap: younger voters are much more likely to favor staying in the E. U. compared to older ones. A recent study found that 69 percent of those under age 35 want to stay and 46 percent of those older than 55 favor leaving. That should be good news for E. U. backers known as the Remain Campaign. But there\u2019s a complication: younger voters are also less likely to actually cast a ballot.",

        "Stephon Alexander didn\u2019t always love music. When he turned 8, his grandmother, who was from Trinidad, forced him to take piano lessons in the Bronx. His teacher was, in a word, strict. \u201dIt felt like a military exercise to rob me of my childhood,\u201d Alexander recalls. Several years went by like that. Until one day when Alexander\u2019s dad brought home an alto sax he found at a garage sale. \u201dThat became my toy. Music no longer for me was this regimented tedium,\u201d he says. Alexander blasted away in the attic. He got good.",
        "When we tried to put the killing of 49 people at an Orlando nightclub on Sunday morning in context, we said and wrote that it was the \u201ddeadliest mass shooting in U. S. history.\u201d It was a deadlier attack than the shooting at Virginia Tech, which left 33 people dead, including the shooter. Almost immediately, our readers and listeners said we were whitewashing history. What about the Wounded Knee Massacre? Or Mountain Meadows Massacre in 1857? Or the Tulsa Massacre in 1921, a reader on Twitter asked."
