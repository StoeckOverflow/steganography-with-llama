The investigation is being treated as a terrorist group.",
        "In a talk in Chicago in 1997, the late evolutionary psychologist Stephen J. Smith allegedly characterized monkeys as \u201d the primates who tell stories. \u201d Psychologist Robyn Dawes goes much further, suggesting humans are \u201d the primates whose cognitive functioning shuts down in the absence of a story. \u201d To be precise, we love a good story. Research suggests that anecdotes can be as persuasive as empirical data, and that jurors are influenced by the combination of the prosecution \u2019 s and defense \u2019 s \u201d stories \u201d when deciding whether to find a defendant guilty.",
        "Americans were suddenly waking up to the worst gun shooting in U. S. since Sunday when Donald Trump popped up on Twitter, boasting about his proposal to ban Muslims from leaving the U. S. and calling on President Obama to resign. He tweeted : \u201d Is Barack Obama going to ever mention the words radical Islamic terrorism?",
        "Responding to the Orlando shootings in a New Hampshire speech rally, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump staged the appearance to expand on his earlier call to temporarily prevent all Muslims from immigrating to the United States. \u201d The only reason the killer was in town in the first place is because we encouraged his family to come here, \u201d Trump said.",
        "The day after the deadliest fatal shooting in American history, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton voted against the possibility of future protests and went after Donald Trump for \u201d inflammatory \u201d rhetoric. \u201d The US is metastasizing, \u201d Clinton said in a speech in Cleveland. \u201d We saw this in America, and we saw it in Brussels.",
        "Sunday coincided with one of the deadliest shootings in American history \u2014 at least 49 people were killed and more than 50 were injured. The attack took place at Pulse, a gay bar in Orlando, and the suspect was an Egyptian Muslim who pledged loyalty to ISIS the night of the attack. The bombing is an immense tragedy for all Americans, but not all Americans will be equally vulnerable in the days and weeks moving forward.",
        "In the wake of a violent shooting at a gay bar in Orlando that left at least 49 people dead and more than 50 wounded, queer Latino folks around the country are reflecting on the events of the attack. Many are mixed up about what clubs like Pulse, the site of the shooting, mean for queer and Latino communities. Others warn against the temptation to blame Islam for the violence, pointing out that there are many Latino Muslims. ( The Pew Research Center estimates that Latinos made up four percent of the 3.",
        "Even with their backup defensive player Draymond Jones suspended, the Golden State Warriors were in a close encounter with the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday night in Oakland. It felt like the sort of game where one late run from veterans Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson could settle Game 5 of the NBA Finals, and the championship series. Then big guy Bogut toppled. A Cavaliers player landed on the winner \u2019 s left leg late in the second half, and Bogut suddenly grabbed his knee.",
        "A few months later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a detailed map that showed the areas of the U. S. that could catch mosquitoes capable of carrying Zika. Several readers, including myself, said, \u201d Zika could come to my house! It could come to California! To Ohio and Indiana! Or to even California! Oh yes! \u201d The map made it sound like a vast swath of the country was at risk for Zika, including New England and the Upper Peninsula. Well, not quite. On Tuesday, CDC scientists published another mosquito map for the U. S.",

Her mother was a follower of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and Hoffman spent most of her childhood in a community in Fairfield, Iowa that was devoted to Transcendental Meditation. Hoffman, who writes about her religious upbringing in the new novel Greetings from Utopia Park, tells Hot Air \u2019 s Dave Smith that moving to the utopian community from New York City when she was was idyllic \u2014 at least initially.",
        "Leon Sturman resides in Sherman Oaks, near the top of a hill that separates the San Fernando Valley from West Los Angeles. His is a narrow, winding street typical of the canyon neighborhoods that usually provide a haven from the rest of urban life. It runs parallel to one of the most congested highways in the country : the 405 freeway. By 7 a. m. daily, Sturman \u2019 s street begins to parallel that freeway. \u201d Take a right down the block, \u201d he says one weekday morning. \u201d How many cars are there?",

        "Hillary Clinton spoke with NPR \u2019 s Scott Inskeep, host of Morning Joe, on Monday, June 13, 2016 \u2014 one day after a deadly tragedy in Orlando. STEVE INSKEEP : When you think about the possibility that this is a U. S. citizen, how are you feeling about the nature of the threat? HILLARY CLINTON : Well, first, you know, I want to join everyone in giving my great sympathy and support for people who lost loved ones in this terrible heart attack and everybody else in the hospital who is struggling and all the first responders.",
        "Celery, the straight product of the vegetable world, costs a puny six calories per liter and \u2014 in my opinion \u2014 about as much energy as a desk lamp. Yet despite its limitations, the fibrous material has featured in Mediterranean and Central Asian civilizations for thousands of years. The paradox puzzled me enough that I got a bunch of specialists at the fields of botany and anthropology to pick their battles. They shared their best guesses about how celery sneaked into our diets. \u201d Celery is good, right? \u201d says Professor Charles Davis of Harvard University.",
        "Some people may be dimly aware that Thailand\u2019s chilies and Italy\u2019s tomatoes \u2014 despite being central to their respective local cuisines \u2014 originated in South America. Now, for the first time, a new study reveals the full extent of globalization in our food supply. More than of the crops that underpin national diets originally came from somewhere else \u2014 often far away. And that trend has accelerated over the past 50 years.

Walgreens cited problems federal regulators have had with Theranos\u2019 lab testing and potential sanctions over problems found at its labs. Walgreens\u2019 withdrawal is another step in a rapid fall from grace for Theranos \u2014 and ends a partnership that was the cornerstone of its early success.

        "Millennials, the thoroughbreds of texting, may lag behind previous generations when it comes to hand strength. In a study of Americans ages occupational therapists found that men younger than 30 have significantly weaker hand grips than their counterparts in 1985 did. The same was true of women ages according to the study published online by the Journal of Hand Therapy a few months back. The findings suggest that it\u2019s time to update what constitutes normal hand strength. The norms are used to assess the severity of injuries and how well people are recovering.",
        "Sometimes artists need special attention. But in this case, it wasn\u2019t because they\u2019ve been jazz pioneers and innovators since the 1960s and are considered to be founding fathers of jazz fusion, not to mention two of the most important jazz figures performing today. It\u2019s not because they\u2019ve collectively recorded more than 100 albums and won 29 Grammy Awards. The agitation was because both of their instruments couldn\u2019t fit behind Bob Boilen\u2019s Tiny Desk. There were logistical hurdles to overcome before the jazz giants\u2019 arrival.",
        "In the aftermath of the Orlando shooting \u2014 the deadliest in recent U. S. history, with 49 victims \u2014 calls for gun control have once again grown louder. In fact, they were shouted on the House floor on Monday. After Speaker Paul Ryan led a moment of silence, Democrats yelled, \u201dWhere\u2019s the bill?\u201d at him, asking for new gun control measures. This isn\u2019t new. The word \u201ddoomed\u201d has become a common adjective to describe gun control efforts. Mass shootings like those in San Bernardino, Calif. Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.",
        "We\u2019re a little late to this story, but we think it\u2019s worth noting. Last night, after Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan called for a moment of silence on the House floor for victims of the Orlando massacre, he tried to get back to regular order. House Democrats were having none of it. Watch: What you\u2019re hearing is Democrats shouting, \u201dWhere\u2019s the bill?\u201d and \u201dNo leadership.\u201d Democrats were angry that Ryan had not let the body consider bills intended to curb gun violence.

        "Why would she teach preschool when she could make a heck of a lot more money teaching kindergarten? It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve heard over and over again reporting on education. In some places, we pay early childhood teachers less than workers, less than tree trimmers. As a country, we\u2019ve acknowledged the importance of early learning and yet, when you look at what we pay those educators, it doesn\u2019t add up. On average, preschool teachers were making $28, 570 in 2015, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",

        "Updated at 8:55 p. m. ET. He called it yapping, loose talk, and sloppiness. President Obama dismissed criticism of his administration\u2019s avoidance of the term \u201dradical Islam\u201d and urged America to live up to its founding values Tuesday, speaking at length about inclusiveness and religious freedom. Obama called out Republicans for criticizing the way he discusses terrorism and extremist groups \u2014 which follows the same logic as his Republican predecessor \u2014 and he directed particular attention to the GOP\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump.",
        "The Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, claimed allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State during a phone call to 911 early Sunday. And that\u2019s reignited a debate over how to label the ideology that apparently inspired the attack. Republican Donald Trump and many on the right say it\u2019s \u201dradical Islam.\u201d But Democrat Hillary Clinton used a different term: \u201dradical Islamism.\u201d It\u2019s not just a debate over semantics. \u201dWhat exactly would using this label accomplish?\u201d President Obama asked Tuesday as he spoke about his administration\u2019s fight against ISIS.

        "Public radio stations across the U. S. have a finger on the pulse when it comes to local music. They know their homegrown music scenes intimately and aren\u2019t shy about championing the artists that emerge from their communities. That\u2019s the reason NPR Music turned to them this spring when we launched our Tiny Desk Contest tour celebrating local bands and artists \u2014 and that\u2019s part of why, every month, we ask a panel of music curators to share one new song they can\u2019t stop playing.",
        "A victim and his doctors described a \u201dwar zone\u201d following the deadliest mass public shooting in modern United States history.
