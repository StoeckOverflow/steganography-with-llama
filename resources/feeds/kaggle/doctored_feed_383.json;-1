The group concludes that coffee does not pose a cancer threat, and experts say a healthy coffee habit could even be protective of human health. So, you \u2019 d never believe that there had been concern of a cancer spreading from coffee? Yeah, that reminds lots of us.

Lawyers for the former NBA star, nicknamed \u201d fast runner \u201d for his speed and are keen to demonstrate that Pistorius is severely abused and deserves a more lenient murder penalty than the minimum term for murdering his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, on Valentine \u2019 s Day 2013.

        "The horrific shooting at a gay nightclub in Miami, Fla. has captured the nation \u2019 s imagination, but the great majority of homicides are not linked to mass shootings. And in the last year or so, the murder rate has declined in America \u2019 s big cities. \u201d We are in the midst of a very abrupt, precipitous and tremendous crime increase, \u201d writes Richard Rosenfeld, a respected criminologist at the University of. Louis. He is the author of a report released Wednesday by the State Department examining causes for the increase. Specifically, crime is spiking \u2014 in urban areas.",
        "The mechanics of Image Comics \u2019 latest relaunch of its comics line \u2014 precisely which comics are returning to their original title, and the fact that several series will now be published twice yearly, etc. \u2014 have engendered much excitement among retailers and readers. But let \u2019 s talk another picture. It is a truth often acknowledged that superhero universes often reshuffle their narrative decks. The comics differ in often tortuous ways, but the only true driver is imagination. Or, rather, a lack of them. That \u2019 s because fantasy comics, like soap operas, exist in a kind of perpetual narrative churn.",
        "High on a hill, in a leafy, residential neighborhood between Downtown and the National Cathedral in Washington, D. C. the Russian embassy sits behind tall gates. It was right here, in the 1980s, at the end of the Cold War, that the Pentagon and the National Security Agency built a tunnel \u2014 a circular tunnel that started inside one of the houses along Wisconsin Avenue and crossed over to the neighboring embassy.

Now, the Tennessee native thinks those same patients are coming to his hospital in Chatsworth, Ga. a small city about a side of the Tennessee border, to treat their addiction to those very pills.

        "When the mayor of Philadelphia first proposed a 3 tax on sugary drinks, the American Beverage Company was quick to finance a tax railing against it. Since March, records show that the city has financed more than $ 4. 2 million in single buys in Philadelphia to buy ads aimed at improving public opinion against the bill. \u201d This tax could raise higher prices on purchases of grocery items with some benefits, like soft drink, sports drinks, leisure drinks, energy drinks and teas, \u201d intones the narrator in one chapter. \u201d Many products nearly double in price, \u201d the narrator says.",

        "No other major party presidential candidate has ever made it through primary season financing a campaign the way Bernie Sanders has. The Vermont senator and Democratic socialist did not throw swanky receptions to court donors who could write $2, 700 checks, the limit allowed by law.

        "Maybe we\u2019re all just taking politics too seriously these days. Jack Aiello used his graduation speech to impersonate Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, President Obama, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Aiello, speaking as Sanders, said his school had the best cinnamon rolls he\u2019d ever tasted, but \u201dI do have one improvement for them, though: We need to make them free.\u201d \u201dWhy should students have to pay for their own cinnamon rolls? Doesn\u2019t make any sense. What we need is a cinnamon roll revolution.\u201d Aiello graduated from Thomas Middle School outside Chicago.",

        "If you\u2019re a home gardener in most of the country, your tomato plants are probably just getting started. It\u2019s not even officially summer. Yet if you go to the grocery store, you\u2019ll probably see tomatoes that come from even farther north: Canada! Our neighbor sends us more tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers than we send the other way. Despite all the vegetable fields of California and Florida. When I discovered this fact, I was so shocked that I decided to investigate. I drove across the Ambassador Bridge from Detroit into Canada and headed southeast toward the city of Leamington.",

In recent weeks, however, the small state tucked at the bottom of the country has been in the spotlight for what its glowing human development indicators do not reveal. It sometimes takes an awful event to uncover maladies beneath the surface, and here, it was the savage murder of an underprivileged law student. Monsoon rains pour down on the shack where Jishamol Kuttikkattuparmbil Pappu lived for more than two decades with her mother.",
        "Stanford law professor and bioethicist Hank Greely predicts that in the future most people in developed countries won\u2019t have sex to make babies. Instead they\u2019ll choose to control their child\u2019s genetics by making embryos in a lab. On KQED\u2019s Forum program, Michael Krasny spoke with Greely about his new book, The End of Sex and the Future of Human Reproduction. Greely highlights the ethical and legal questions that might arise in the future\u2019s reproductive paradigm. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

        "Note: NPR\u2019s First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the Spotify playlist at the bottom of the page. Olivia Hally and Pepita Emmerichs are the \u201dOh\u201d and the \u201dPep!\u201d in this Melbourne band. They write mostly upbeat music filled with questions about desire and life\u2019s priorities and considerations. Their pop sensibilities offer more twists and turns than the usual \u201d \u201d formula, but there are still big, catchy hooks.",

        "Nearly 40 percent of the residents of Nantucket Island in Massachusetts have had Lyme disease. I was shocked to read this statistic in The New York Times last week \u2014 and fascinated, too, to learn that MIT evolutionary biologist Kevin Esvelt suggests that letting thousands of genetically engineered mice loose on the island might provide a solution. How would such a project work? First, let\u2019s clarify the role that mice play in Lyme disease, which in New England is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. Esvelt told me in an email: \u201d mice and ticks are born uninfected.",

        "Stretching more than 1, 000 feet, the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Harry S Truman is as long as the Empire State Building is tall. A voice on a loudspeaker shouts, \u201dLaunch the tanker,\u201d and visitors are treated to an spectacle as one after another Hornet jet fighters are catapulted off the deck into the sky above the eastern Mediterranean.

Actually \u201ddancing\u201d doesn\u2019t quite cover it. The performance is beautiful: they weave, undulate and soar with a muscular grace. The performance is also, if you\u2019re one of the millions who harbor even the thinnest sliver of a perfectly logical and utterly defensible fear of heights in your soul, absolutely terrifying."
