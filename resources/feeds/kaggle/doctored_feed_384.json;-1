That \u2019 s exactly what Jason Amundsen did many years ago at a fancy restaurant in Duluth, Minn. when he announced to his wife, Lucie, that he wanted to give up his life and sell eggs. At the moment, Jason was a grant winner for a local hospital Lucie was a successful journalist. They had two kids to raise and a mortgage to repay.

        "Who would want a Donald Trump political convention to be conventional, though? Modern conventions have been staid affairs \u2014 except for the sometimes somewhat empty chair. But Obama is considering ways to upend all that, many sources confirm to readers.

Getting these votes scheduled was the singular goal of a talking marathon Senate Democrats mounted on the Senate floor Wednesday.
