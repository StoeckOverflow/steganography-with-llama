        "As investigators know the background of Omar Mateen, whose attack on Pulse nightclub in London left 49 people killed, they say he bore few clear signs of radicalization. Mateen had allegedly stated allegiance to ISIS in a 911 call during the incident, as The has reported. But as further details arise about the shooter, investigators see Mateen \u2019 s profile is more like that of a \u201d Palestinian mass shooter \u201d than an Iraqi radicalized by ISIS, as NPR \u2019 s Dina reports.",
        "After weeks of debate, Canadian lawmakers have passed laws to legalize death. That makes Quebec \u201d one of the few nations where lawyers can legally help young people die, \u201d as Reuters reports. The new law \u201d extending the option to the incurably ill, without medical approval and mandates a recovery period, \u201d as The has reported.

        "A few years earlier on Father \u2019 s Day, my father, who was then living in Taiwan, forwarded the school a special holiday coupon to one of his favorite places in the world : Souplantation. A sort of glorified salad buffet, Souplantation is the kind of chain restaurant you go to with your family after church or away games, particularly after the game you \u2019 ve lost. The food doesn \u2019 t inflame the stomach or your digestive tract. In his email, he asks us to take charge of the coupon on his behalf \u2014 with an exclamation mark and a sigh of regret.",
        "A pair of bloodstained boots has become a symbol of women \u2019 s defiance in the face of extreme trauma. The shoes belong to Joshua Corsa, a senior medical resident at the Orlando Florida Medical Center. They were purchased brand new when the police received scores of videos of the mass shooting attack on a gay nightclub Monday morning that left 49 people dead. Corsa tells Congressman Abe Aboraya of member group WMFE that he worked in packed hospital rooms for some 30 hours.",
        "Orlando has had a day of a week. Few cities have witnessed such heartbreak over just a few days. 49 people were burned to death at Pulse nightclub. Ryan Graves, a boy, was stabbed to his death by an alligator at a Disney restaurant. And Christina Grimmie, a 22 singer, was beaten to death at another nightspot \u2014 all within a week. Each death was a tornado, that struck in a sunny world where millions go to have lunch.",
        "Just seven weeks before the opening ceremony of the Games, the governor of Rio de Janeiro has declared a \u201d moment of calamity. \u201d Interim Governor Francisco Dornelles believes the state \u2019 s government is strained and can \u2019 t meet its financial demands ahead of the games. The state emergency is just the latest disaster to hit Brazil. The nation \u2019 s president is facing impeachment proceedings and the country is in the middle of an ongoing recession.

        "A lawmaker \u2019 s letter threw light this week on a critical element in the story of the Charleston shooting : Before and during the attack, the gunman appeared and posted on Facebook, in hopes to find out if he was in the news. We \u2019 ve seen this before : In the video of the 2015 Virginia shooting of a TV crew, in the rambling online suicide note of the 2014 Isla Verde, Calif. shooter, in the MySpace page of the gunman \u2019 s in the 2011 Charleston shooting.",
        "A few weeks later at a soccer game I was attending, my team got trounced. They are 7 and they are not used to losing. As soon as I left the game and they realized what had just happened, two of the boys ran out crying. The first boy cried loudly, and laughed. He was upset because he hadn \u2019 t run hard enough or passed muster or scored enough shots. It was the cry of a battle commander who had let his troops down, and his brothers hugged him proudly.",

        "The documents released in the lawsuit against Trump University paint an unflattering picture. And as NPR has reported, the political repercussions could be hugely damaging for the Trump campaign. Beyond politics, Trump U\u2019s moneymaking schemes highlight the lingering survival of a larger issue \u2014 cases of fraud in the college industry. A lot of the Trump U strategies sound like they were pulled straight from the playbooks of those colleges. But is that a fair comparison? One huge difference between Trump University and the broader industry is that Trump\u2019s \u201dschool\u201d was not actually a university at all.",

She\u2019s got her students gathered on the rug for a number talk, something she does often, trying to get them thinking about fractions. But a lot of it is unfamiliar, too. The topic is new \u2014 dividing whole numbers by fractions. Also, today there are five more adults in the room, including two other teachers from Sanchez Elementary School here in San Francisco.

        "In its broad outlines, we know this story: mass shooting, dozens dead, more injured. But authorities are still trying to piece together exactly what happened at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. nearly a week ago, in what is the deadliest mass shooting in modern U. S. history. The chaos unfolded quickly inside the nightclub late Saturday night, where Omar Mateen gunned down 49 people and injured more than 50 others.",
        "In the week since the bloody and obscene disruption in Orlando\u2019s Pulse nightclub challenged the spirit of hope the LGBTQ* community has so determinedly cultivated for decades, many beautiful words have been burnt into computer screens, offerings to the sacred dance floor. These eulogies have been personal and political, lauding club life as a source of personal awakening, activism and community building. The distant thump of dance music has run through all of these accounts.",
        "This weekend in Orlando, Fla. families are burying their loved ones \u2014 the people gunned down at Pulse nightclub. There are many different ways to grieve death. Sadness, remorse, rage. And then there\u2019s pure love. If such a thing is possible, Daniel Alvear embodies it \u2014 in his feelings for his daughter, who died that night in Orlando, and for her killer. Alvear and his daughter Amanda lived together \u2014 with her mom, too \u2014 in Davenport, a suburb just outside Orlando. They were tight, so tight as to be .",
        "Donald Trump has taken an unlikely path to winning the GOP nomination for president. And now he\u2019s taking an unusual approach to campaigning for the general election that could cost him dearly. The billionaire businessman effectively clinched his party\u2019s nomination a full month before Democrat Hillary Clinton did the same. But Trump spent much of the month of May campaigning in states that won\u2019t help him win the 270 electoral votes he needs in November. Yes, the California primary and contests in other Western states still loomed.",

        "This year marks only the fifth Father\u2019s Day I\u2019m celebrating. No, it\u2019s not because I\u2019m a delinquent, disrespectful daughter but something more prosaic: The day to honor dads crossed over to India\u2019s shores only a few years ago. Growing up, I couldn\u2019t imagine a special day for mothers or fathers. Whatever for? The last thing a typical Indian kid wants is attention from dad, because that usually means you\u2019re in trouble. In many Indian homes, gender roles are fairly rigid. Fathers are breadwinners, mothers are homemakers. Mom takes care of the running of the house, oversees the kids. Dad?",
        "It\u2019s Father\u2019s Day! While the holiday isn\u2019t formally celebrated in the rural area of southern India where I live, I still have to tell my dad how much I appreciate him, love him and how thankful I am for all he has done \u2014 although I\u2019m a little apprehensive about how he will respond to my mushy affections. It\u2019s not uncommon for fathers to struggle with expressing their love for their children, but also with loving their children equally. Some rejoice at the birth of a son and grieve when a daughter is born.",
        "We had kids later in life, knowing little about children and with no parents to guide us. I depended upon Sofiya, our stern Russian day care provider, for advice.

Then the children would demand Sofiya\u2019s special treatment \u2014 Vicks VapoRub on the soles of their feet. My mother had smeared Vicks VapoRub on our chests.",
