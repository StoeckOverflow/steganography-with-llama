        "As mourners hold funerals in Orlando for the victims of last season \u2019 s nightclub shooting, the area \u2019 s theater community is banding together to protect them from protesters. Dressed in white and wearing large glasses, the \u201d angels \u201d stood in a field in order to shield the family and friends of the victims. The intention, according to American politics, is to allow the mourners to \u201d grieve in peace. \u201d The Florida Shakespeare Theater began the effort after the Westboro Baptist Church called for its members to walk outside funerals in Orlando on Friday, holding signs with slogans.",
        "A Tennessee court has found former LSU football player Brian Vandenburg guilty of multiple charges of aggravated rape and aggravated sexual abuse in a case that stems from the 2013 statutory rape of a woman he had been defending. The case gained media attention and sparked questions about the prevalence of sexual assaults on U. S. college campuses. That discussion has received new momentum recently amid outrage over the six year sentence handed to Ryan Turner, a former professional swimmer, for sexually assaulting an Australian woman.",
        "An Oregon statute has allowed a retired oil tank mechanic to switch gender identity. Not from male to female, or vice versa. But to a new, third gender. Jamie Shupe is now legally \u2014 widely believed to be a first for the United States. Oregon led several countries in choosing a third gender. In 2014, California became the largest state in the world to have an official adoption option, following in the areas of Pakistan, Australia and Canada. Shupe was born male, never married and had a child.",
        "Figuring out what sounds will mix together takes a sharp intuition. Neko Case, k. d. lang and Tim Veirs are all accomplished solo artists \u201d but they decided to combine based on lang \u2019 s hunch that a collaboration might be fruitful. \u201d It was completely instinctual, \u201d lang says. \u201d I didn \u2019 t really think, but I did feel like there were many differences and enough complexity that it would blend together to create something real and comfortable. \u201d The result was the band \u2019 s new album release on June 17.

        "It is tough to be a postman in China. The country is among the world \u2019 s most sparsely populated \u2014 twice the population of Texas with about the state \u2019 s population of about 27 million. Its roads, particularly in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar, sometimes lack names, making navigation difficult and public addresses unreliable. To make matters even more important, about a quarter of the country \u2019 s people are nomadic, with no permanent population. All of that means it can often be extremely challenging for the Mongol authorities to locate people. Things are looking up, though.",
        "Updated at 7 : 40 p. m. ET with Senate members, To virtually no one \u2019 s delight, the Senate failed to approve any of the four gun safety proposals \u2014 two made by Democrats, and two by Republicans \u2014 that came in response to last week \u2019 s mass shooting in Orlando, Fla. Here are the results : A measure sponsored by Charles Grassley, the Senate Judiciary Committee chair, failed on a vote of seven votes short of the 60 needed.

        "By now we know that Zika is used for pregnant women and their infant babies. The virus can cause devastating birth defects. But what about for infections after babies are born? Or in older children? Is Zika a risk for them? So far, all the evidence suggests probably not. But there are a few caveats. Let \u2019 s begin with what we know. For adults, Zika virus causes only mild symptoms. There \u2019 s a rash, fever, joint swelling or red eyes, which burn away within a year. And many people don \u2019 t feel symptoms at all.",
        "Hours after analyzing a partial transcript of Orlando gunman recording Mateen \u2019 s 911 phone call with authorities during the deadly shooting that left 49 victims dead, the department has released a new edition of the record \u2014 one that includes Mateen \u2019 s pledge of allegiance to ISIS.

ET : The Justice Department and FBI have now released the official transcript of Orlando shooter Al Mateen \u2019 s 911 call, which includes his defending the Islamic State and terrorist Abu Bakr. In a joint statement, the agencies said they had withheld the release because they \u201d did not want to provide the military or terrorist organizations with a clear platform for hateful propaganda \u201d but continued to do so after the issue had become a \u201d public \u201d to the investigation.",
        "Updated 7 p. m. ET June 29 with this clarification : Official reports on June 20, when Costco announced it would switch the form of credit card it would accept, said the new cards would not have roadside help. But Citi spokeswoman Jennifer Bombardier now tells reporters that the Costco Visa cards \u201d provide a comparable roadside assistance system. \u201d NerdWallet says overall the new Costco Visa card has better benefits than the old Costco Visa Express card.

        "Although close to the world \u2019 s largest food reserves, Venezuela continues to be running out of almost everything these days : food, fuel, electricity, even gasoline. Economic conditions have grown so bad that Venezuelans are ransacking grocery stores \u2014 even though many are largely empty. A security monitoring group, Citizens for Violence, says there are about 10 lootings per day around the country, with food riots quickly turning deadly. Four people were killed during several incidents last year as looters clashed with security forces.",

R. Martin to that of his literary predecessor, J. R. R. Tolkien. Tolkien\u2019s Lord of the Rings is black and white, they say \u2014 a place where pure, unremitting threatens pure, Good.

        "\u201dSpecificity is the soul of narrative\u201d is a thing John Hodgman likes to say when he\u2019s hearing cases on the smart and funny Judge John Hodgman podcast, and it\u2019s applicable to documentary film, too. Documentaries devoted to a topic with heft do better if they can find a particular angle, a particular way into the question.

Its cast recording has gone platinum and hit No. 1 on the rap chart. A large part of Hamilton\u2019s appeal is that it takes the story of America\u2019s Founding Fathers and recasts it in contemporary terms \u2014 the score is an amalgam of RB and pop, and the cast is multiracial.",

        "Updated at 6:20 p. m. ET, Donald Trump has parted ways with his campaign manager and close ally, Corey Lewandowski. The move appears to be a reaction to the presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s sagging poll numbers and weeks of difficulty as he prepped for a tough fight with Hillary Clinton. Hours after his abrupt exit, Lewandowski gave a pair of television interviews in which he put a positive spin on his exit. \u201dI wouldn\u2019t change one second of my time with Mr.",

        "It\u2019s not every day that an actress has a television show written specifically for her, but that\u2019s exactly what happened with Ellie Kemper and the Netflix series Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. \u201dI still am not sure what in my face screams \u2019 victim\u2019 to [show creators Robert Carlock and Tina Fey] but something did, so they went with that,\u201d Kemper jokes to Fresh Air\u2019s Ann Marie Baldonado.

        "Note: NPR\u2019s First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the Spotify playlist at the bottom of the page. The Avett Brothers\u2019 catalog is broad enough to encompass jittery punk bluegrass, barren acoustic ballads about heartache and family, and stately that borders on the orchestral. Along the way, brothers Seth and Scott Avett \u2014 along with bassist Bob Crawford and cellist Joe Kwon, among others, with production by Rick Rubin \u2014 have seen their star rise with the growth of Mumfordian .",

According to new data from the Education Department, black students \u2014 from kindergarten through high school \u2014 are 3. 8 times more likely to be suspended than white students. Now the really bad news. This trend begins in preschool, where black children are already 3. 6 times more likely to be suspended than white students.

        "On June 20, 1840, Samuel Morse received a patent for an early version of the electric telegraph. His ideas for transmitting and recording signals helped revolutionize communication. Fast forward 176 years and you\u2019re likely to be reading this on a smartphone, in a future Morse couldn\u2019t possibly have imagined. Our signals travel through air. They carry photos and videos. A sophisticated toddler can navigate an iPhone, manipulating more bits of data than a telegraph operator encountered in a lifetime. But failures of imagination go both ways: not only to the future, but also to the past.",

The burger looks, tastes and smells like beef \u2014 except it\u2019s made entirely from plants. It sizzles on the grill and even browns and oozes fat when it cooks. It\u2019s the brainchild of former Stanford biochemist Patrick Brown and his research team at Northern Impossible Foods. The startup\u2019s goal is like many in Silicon Valley \u2014 to create a product that will change the world."
