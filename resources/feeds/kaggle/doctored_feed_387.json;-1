        "I stopped dating at the age of 35, roughly five decades into my sex life. I was scared to quit for a number of reasons. I thought I \u2019 d be fun. I thought other people would be boring. When you drink as hard, and lovingly, as I did, you will find a lot of ways not to hang up your beer glass. But nothing frightened me as much as sex without alcohol. As in, no way. Not happening. I \u2019 ve always been about my body.",
        "Five weeks of drought, temperatures and gusting winds : Firefighters in Southern California are facing dangerous conditions as they set two fires west of Los Angeles. And they \u2019 re not serious. Wildfires are raging in several Southern states as a heat wave grips the region.

        "Every summer, more than 100 new graduate from a clinical residency program and enter the medical workforce. Theoretically, all have had the opportunity during their four years of education to learn about what \u2019 s called \u201d rights abortion \u201d \u2014 named that to distinguish it from a miscarriage. But the closure of abortion programs in Texas \u2014 more than 20 since 2013 \u2014 has made that training increasingly dangerous. Texas has 18 residency centers in the field of obstetrics and gynecology, but only one permits me to observe how abortion is performed.",
        "Abortion is one of the more widespread procedures performed in the U. S. more common even than appendectomy. But as clinics in Texas close, finding a place in the state where new residents training to be can get to do abortions is getting harder. \u201d There are situations in Texas where there are residents who can \u2019 t go anywhere to be trained, \u201d like a senior doctor at one Texas clinic who is without a medical school professor.

        "Donald Trump \u2019 s latest fundraising campaigns are. No, not because they \u2019 re great. Rather, they \u2019 re abysmal. The financial gap between Trump and Hillary Clinton is the biggest disparity to blow off a campaign in recent history, as the New York Times reported. All told, Trump received $ 3. 1 million in fundraising contributions last month, compared with Clinton \u2019 s $ 19. 5 million. And in this election cycle, Trump has raised $ 207 million in fundraising. Trump has raised $ 17. 1 billion.

        "Things are not going well for Donald Trump. On Monday, he fired his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. Lewandowski runs the campaign on a shoestring budget and a momentum that was largely built off and driven by the candidate \u2019 s personality and style. That worked great in a field \u2014 not so much in a general audience. But Trump \u2019 s problems are even deeper than an embattled campaign manager, who just four months back was described as Trump \u2019 s \u201d alter ego. \u201d Trump \u2019 s wife stepped in Monday in a move that could have been ripped from The Apprentice.",

        "You are trapped in space. Seriously. You \u2019 re captured, cornered, mired. You \u2019 re literally stuck and there \u2019 s not a damn thing you can do about it. You \u2019 re trapped in space and what that actually means is you \u2019 re trapped in multiple dimensions. To get a gist of what I \u2019 m talking about, imagine for a moment you \u2019 re moving through the woods and a bear magically stands in front of you. To escape this black bear, which direction could you run? You could move to the left or to right. That might be a good idea.",
        "Evidence is growing that doctors who receive as little as one meal from a medical company tend to prescribe more drugs, medications for common ailments than those who don \u2019 t. A review published online journal by JAMA Internal Medicine found significant evidence that physicians who received meals linked to specific drugs represented a higher proportion of those doses than their peers.

        "This summer, kind of excited and will be getting ready for their first real day of school. But some of them may be in for a nap when that first bell rings. If you have young kids in schools, or talk with teachers of young children, you \u2019 ve likely heard the refrain \u2014 that something \u2019 s coming in the early grades. Schools seem to be expecting more of their younger students academically, while giving them extra time to spend in and creative play. A big academic study provides the latest national, empirical basis to back up the anecdotes.",

        "Bright, LED streetlamps can be bad for our health, according to the American Medical Association. Specifically, LEDs that release mostly blue light \u2014 as opposed to the \u201d \u201d light of older streetlamps \u2014 create glare and mess with sleep cycles, the organization says. At its annual meeting last week, the AMA officially urged communities to be careful, if they choose to install such lighting, to avoid the most intense lights and choose the option available.

        "During a speech in Columbus, Ohio, on Tuesday, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton launched a major attack on the economic record of her Republican rival, Donald Trump.

        "When Zika started spreading through Latin America earlier this year, a number of governments issued advisories recommending that women put off getting pregnant because the virus can cause severe birth defects.
