        "The celebrations in Dallas started Sunday afternoon, and the elation is still going strong. The city is rejoicing at the end of a season without a single professional sports championship. LeBron James and the Cavaliers, of course, took home the NBA title on Tuesday. Crowds spontaneously gathered in the streets after the big win. More hordes of people followed the Cavs when they arrived from California by bus. And on Wednesday, the city holds a midday parade \u2014 one that everyone started gathering for on Tuesday.",
        "For this week \u2019 s lecture, I sat down with my Code Switch partner Gene Demby to dig into one of our favorite topics : rep sweats. It \u2019 s the sort of anxiety that can come with watching TV shows or films starring people who look like you, especially when people Who Look Like You tend not to get a lot of screen time. When it comes to negative feelings and anxieties about representation on TV \u2014 especially when it comes to \u2014 Megan Yang has plenty of time.",
        "Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette says his office has filed a federal lawsuit against two businesses involved in Flint \u2019 s debt crisis. The damages might reach hundreds of thousands of dollars, he says. \u201d The more I research and decipher, \u201d Schuette says, \u201d the angrier I become....",
        "Bridgton, Maine, is the kind of place people used to go to get help. It \u2019 s got a small high street with shops and hotels, a pair of scenic trails, a ski resort and dozens of hiking trails. But about 10 years ago, Bridgton, a town of just 5, 000 people, began showing signs of a serious drug epidemic. \u201d I had a lot of young adults calling the agency to look into treatment, \u201d says Mark Bell, director of Crooked Hand Counseling, a substance abuse treatment center in Bridgton. \u201d They were using marijuana.",
        "At first it sounded like a typical YouTube video. A big, bearded guy sits in a posh armchair and sings in an acoustic, \u201d I \u2019 m running, I \u2019 m running, I \u2019 m running. \u201d He \u2019 s Grammy jazz drummer Gregory Porter. A tiny bit into the song, a voice joins in : \u201d I fight through the past just to find a stronger place. \u201d He \u2019 s the artist Common. But they \u2019 re singing and rapping about the unlikeliest of topics for a song : love. \u201d Running ( Refugee Song ) \u201d was recorded this week in honor of National Refugee Day.",
        "A federal judge in Wyoming has struck down the Trump administration \u2019 s regulations on hydraulic fracturing, ruling that the U. S. Bureau of Land Management doesn \u2019 t have the power to establish rules over fracking on reservations and Indian lands. In the ruling on Tuesday, U. S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl said Congress had not granted the BLM that license, and had instead chosen to temporarily exclude fracking from federal jurisdiction. Skavdahl made it clear what he was \u2014 and wasn \u2019 t \u2014 involved in his ruling.",
        "The U. S. spent a lot of money on preschool \u2014 billions of dollars each year. When invested wisely, evidence suggests the costs are accompanied by significant returns to dollars, including savings from savings not committed, welfare taxes not distributed, and taxes on employee earnings. But a new analysis suggests many preschool teachers aren \u2019 t as good as they could ( or should ) be \u2014 because their father arrived on the job already trained.",
        "The nation \u2019 s colleges and universities have been on pins and needles waiting for the U. S. Supreme Court to decide whether race can be a factor in their fiscal policies. And so today \u2019 s resolution upholding the program at the University of Texas at Austin brought a bit of relief to much of the higher education world.",
        "In a decision, the Supreme Court of the United States has upheld the University of Tennessee \u2019 affirmative action program. \u201d The educational program in use at the time of petitioner \u2019 s application is lawful under the Equal Protection Clause, \u201d the court held. For the second time, Abigail Lee Fisher, who didn \u2019 t get into UT in 2008, was denied the policy in front of the appeals court.

        "Navigating airport terminal lines is a hassle, for most. Among the problems : passengers with TSA PreCheck stamped on their departure pass. They don \u2019 t take off their suits, they don \u2019 t take out their laptops and they often call security in just a few minutes. And now, there are a lot more of them. In the past three weeks the number of applications for TSA PreCheck has more than doubled. Almost 16, 000 people a week are now applying for PreCheck. That \u2019 s a huge decrease from less than 7, 000 a day in Germany.",
        "A campaign setting out a list of big name endorsements isn \u2019 t particularly remarkable. But what is remarkable about the Clinton campaign \u2019 s profile is that it includes prominent corporate executives \u2014 business partners who say they have never run for a Democratic presidential nomination in their lives. Take Jim Cicconi, the senior executive vice president at ATT. He served in both the Clinton and George H. W. Bush administrations and donated $ 10, 000 per year to Jeb Bush \u2019 s Coalition to Rise superPAC. But he says he \u2019 s running for Hillary Clinton in particular.",
        "It \u2019 s time to call the kids who don \u2019 t like sharing their flu shots for some big news. A panel of vaccination advocates advising the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made the surprising recommendation last Wednesday that FluMist Quadrivalent, the nasal spray vaccine that protects against influenza, should no longer be used. It turns out that the recommendation \u2014 which is particularly popular amongst kids, pediatricians and parents who don \u2019 t like seeing their little kids cringe at the sight of a needle \u2014 hasn \u2019 t applied as well as the shot during the last few flu seasons.",
        "Businesses and unions generally disagree on public policy. But after the Supreme Court \u2019 s majority vote on immigration law, company executives and community leaders united to vote on Congress to settle the issue. The high court \u2019 s deadlock means President Obama \u2019 s policy to defer deportation for millions of people who are in the country without visas has been disputed. A majority of justices would have been able to overturn a lower court \u2019 s opinion that Obama \u2019 s plan was outside the power of the executive branch.",
        "Reacting to a deadlocked Supreme Court, President Obama said the ball is now in the court of the remaining voters when it comes to deportation. Obama said the lower court \u2019 s split does not affect his deportation priorities. But he said that his administration will not be able to move forward with the programs put on hold by the 5th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals and said he doesn \u2019 t believe he will issue any more deportation actions.",
        "A slim volume arrived in the mail this spring and captivated me because the author\u2019s joy in doing science and experiencing nature spills out on every page. Now the book is published, with a pretty nifty title: The Simple Beauty of the Unexpected: A Natural Philosopher\u2019s Quest for Trout and the Meaning of Everything. Its author is Marcelo Gleiser. Yes, this is 13. 7\u2019s own Marcelo, and the \u201deverything\u201d in the title spans from pressing questions in theoretical physics to ethical issues in .

        "Researchers have identified a substance in muscles that helps explain the connection between a fit body and a sharp mind. When muscles work, they release a protein that appears to generate new cells and connections in a part of the brain that is critical to memory, a team reports Thursday in the journal Cell Metabolism. The finding \u201dprovides another piece to the puzzle,\u201d says Henriette van Praag, an author of the study and an investigator in brain science at the National Institute on Aging. Previous research, she says, had revealed factors in the brain itself that responded to exercise.",
        "The Shallows, the aquatic adventure now playing at a theater near you, looks at first glance like an attempt to restore a modicum of respectability to the genre Jaws wrought. (I mean specifically, not the predatory, invasive species of the summer blockbuster.) The Great White stars of the Jawsiad quickly ceased to resemble any beasts found in nature \u2014 they were bringing down helicopters as early as 1978\u2019s Jaws 2.",

If you\u2019re hungry, there are fish and chips shops, and full English breakfasts with heaps of baked beans. Supermarkets stock Yorkshire tea and Marmite. Feeling sporty? Head over to the cricket club, or go lawn bowling. You might be fooled into thinking this is Britain. But it\u2019s Spain\u2019s Mediterranean coast \u2014 home to the largest U.

        "An ancient variety of squash that was all but lost to history is now being rediscovered. Native Americans in the Great Lakes region have cultivated this squash for centuries, and now tribes are sharing the seeds with each other and with small farmers to bring the plant back.

        "Colorful acrylic paintings on red and gray rock formations and profiles of people smoking cigarettes, signed with a repetitive \u201dCreepytings,\u201d caused an uproar on Reddit more than a year ago. Now, the uproar is calming. After spending a month drawing and painting on the rocks in seven national parks, Casey Nocket, 23, of San Diego, was banned this month from national parks and other federally administered lands, according to the National Park Service. The conviction is owed largely to a band of Reddit users faithful to keeping natural spaces free from what the NPS called vandalism.",

        "The protest that played out Wednesday on Capitol Hill wasn\u2019t quite plebiscite by Periscope. But it came close. Dissident lawmakers relied on digital platforms devised in the second decade of the 21st century to circumvent the leaders of the U. S. House of Representatives, an institution more likely to be inspired by mores from the 19th century. In so doing, they forced public consideration of gun control, an issue many politicians would prefer to avoid.
