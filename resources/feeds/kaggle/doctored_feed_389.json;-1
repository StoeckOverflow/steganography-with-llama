        "The rant is a staple of football fandom. At Thanksgiving, at the office, in town, via text, on campus \u2014 wherever sports topics go, rants go, too. It made sense, then, that the biggest ticket out of Wednesday \u2019 s premiere of Russell Simmons \u2019 new TV talk show Any Given Wednesday was a sports rant. And it wasn \u2019 t from the original guest, Charles Barkley. It was from the regular guest, Ben Affleck. Affleck \u2019 s favorite brand of celebrity has long been a weird dance of bits of public mockery, undeniable talent, plenty of flops, and surprisingly durable charm.",

It \u2019 s not that things are inherently creepy, per se. It \u2019 s that, more than in many other momentous occasions, the same patterns and symbols that make a woman lovely seem to have particularly dark counterparts. A white wedding dress creates a desiccated, dangerous fire elemental. Adoration becomes obsession. Promises to love forever become the endless pursuit of ghosts. Weddings are proving ground for storytellers, in other words : wedding ceremony, a hundred different outcomes.",
        "The photograph has been ingrained in pop culture since nearly the moment it was taken \u2014 a steadfast classmate in high school textbooks and an enduring symbol of U. S. perseverance. But it appears we \u2019 ve been wrong about Albert Rosenthal \u2019 s Pulitzer image of the on Iwo Jima, Washington, at least in one very general respect. One of those old men has been misidentified for decades. \u201d The U. S. Marine Corps has stated that a previously unknown person is in the iconic flag raising image taken atop Mt.",
        "A ceremony in Havana, Cuba, on Thursday represented a major step towards peace in Colombia, when the nation \u2019 s biggest rebel coalition and its national government reached a historic agreement. Colombia \u2019 s conflict has stretched for more than half a century, and peace talks between the FARC and the Colombian have taken decades. But on Wednesday, the two countries announced they had reached an agreement for a bilateral \u2014 replacing an alliance unilateral by the rebels.",
        "A Baltimore court has acquitted Officer Thomas Goodson of murder and all other charges in a case related to the death of William Gray. Gray, a disabled man, died from a spinal cord injury suffered while in police custody last year. Goodson drove the van that transported Gray after his death. Gray apparently suffered the fatal injury during that bus ride, during which he was handcuffed, shackled and not wearing a gun belt. The incident provoked protests and riots in Baltimore and raised questions about criminal negligence.",
        "Five months ago, the residents of a rural Chinese village attracted the world \u2019 s attention when they pushed Communist Party officials out of their hamlet and elected a local leader. Now, the land disputes that spurred them to action remain unresolved, and the residents of Wukan village are rounded up in protest once again after their elected leader was detained on corruption every Saturday. Back in 2011, the events in Wukan were seen as a milestone, as a large Chinese community without local authorities and local democracy, at least at the local level.",
        "Each year plenty of new artists forms part of my life listening. Last year Josh Barnett, Soak, Ibeyi, Girlpool and many more all played a huge part of my attention for the year and some wound up on my first top ten songs. This year, Lucy Dacus, Night Thief, Margaret Glaspy, Mothers, Overcoats and Weaves are all part of my love listening, and are all artists getting a debut either with their debut album, EP or very important songs. So who are your favorite young artists in 2016, the musicians you can \u2019 t stand listening to?",
        "When Donald Trump arrived in Scotland one morning, hours after the United Kingdom voted to join the European Union, the presumptive US presidential nominee was quick to draw parallels between the U. K. \u2019 s political career, and his own campaign for president. \u201d Scots want to take their independence back, \u201d Trump said, \u201d They want to have independence, in a world. And you see it in Europe, all over Europe. \u201d And while Scotland itself voted overwhelmingly to stay in the European Union, Scotland is right.",
        "The decision by UK voters to leave the European Union sent shudders through European capitals and shock waves through the financial markets. It also sent the U. S. media campaigns scrambling to respond. Both countries initially released identical statements. Donald Trump \u2019 s arrived in early Saturday morning : The people of the United Kingdom have exercised the full right of all free citizens. They have declared their independence from the European Union and have voted to reassert authority over their own politics, borders and interests.",
        "Twelve months ago, I tried to put a stake into the heart of the heart. Personality tests are neither reliable nor reliable, I argued, and we should stop using them \u2014 especially for important decisions that affect the future of people \u2019 s lives, particularly workplace hiring and retention. But if I thought that my book, The Cult of Personality Assessment, would lead to changes in the world, I was keenly mistaken. Personality testing appear to be more popular than literature.",

This story contains facts that some may find funny. This is the story of a prisoner who committed a horrible crime and knows he \u2019 s no longer the same person who did it.

It\u2019s been a momentous event, building up for months with anticipation and anxiety domestically and abroad, marked by bitter campaigning, sharp regional disagreements and the murder of an \u201dBrexit\u201d member of Parliament, Jo Cox.

He\u2019s tough on immigration, and keen to point out President Obama\u2019s Kenyan heritage. Lots of people call him by his first name only. He once starred on TV. He\u2019s not Donald Trump. He\u2019s Boris Johnson, who was the mayor of London until he stepped down last month. Now he could become the United Kingdom\u2019s next prime minister.",

The researchers, led by Rongjia Tao of Temple University, were able to remove up to 20 percent of fat by running liquid milk chocolate through an electrified sieve. And they say the chocolate tastes good, too. Before they\u2019re bundles that make chocoholics smile, chocolate bars start out as liquid in a factory: delicious particles of cocoa solids (which give chocolate its characteristic flavor) sugar and mixed solids, suspended in melted fat and oil, mostly cocoa butter (typically, up to 40 percent by volume).",

        "Musician and composer Frank Zappa was a lot of things: biting satirist, ferocious critic of societal norms, outspoken defender of free speech. He saw himself as not only an entertainer, but also a serious composer. And he saw no contradiction in being all of these things at once, to the consternation and confusion of the many journalists who interviewed him. A number of those interviews have been compiled in German documentarian Thorsten Schutte\u2019s new film Eat That Question: Frank Zappa in His Own Words.",
