        "Over the past 70 years, the U. S. has been waging a war against a terrible menace : the New World screwworm. The legend of how we eradicated the critter has it all : triumph of the little mouse, a medical treatment that saved bacon ( i. e. \u201d food therapy \u201d ) and a new cure to wipe out horrible people \u2014 one that scientists are developing today to try to control the Zika virus. The screwworm is arguably the most cringeworthy species on Earth. Seriously, if you \u2019 re squeamish at all, you may want to skip the last few paragraphs.",
        "A horse is a substitute, of course of course \u2014 that is, of course, unless the horse is a man. For bikers who are more prone to galloping, Trotify is a substitute. Taking a page from Monty Python \u2019 s book, the wooden gadget attaches to the wheel of bike and claps together a little so it sounds like a trotting stick. Sort of an upgraded version of the original trick. The device comes packed flat, so riders just pop out the wooden parts and assemble it themselves.",
        "When we invited the singers Mashrou \u2019 Leila to come play at the Help Desk, we couldn \u2019 t have foreseen the timing. The group arrived at our office the morning after the failed June 12 shootings in Orlando at the Miami nightclub Pulse. We were all collectively reeling from the attacks, and for this rock band from Tripoli, Lebanon, the attack happened very heavily.",
        "After more than $ 5 billion and close to a decade of construction, Congress opens the long term expansion of its storied canal. Trying to potentially double its global cargo, the expansion has weathered economic disputes, serious issues regarding its design and a huge slump in international shipping. Will the canal bring the benefits back to this tiny Central American nation? The eyes and hearts of a country are all on Landon Rankin one Sunday morning.",
        "Legendary New York Times fashion photographer Bill Cunningham, famous for his images, has died at the age of 87. Cunningham \u2019 s death was announced by The Times and confirmed by Kathy Murphy, a spokeswoman for the newspaper. His death comes two days after he was reportedly hospitalized following a surgery. He had photographed for the Times for almost four decades, retiring in 1978 after a chance photograph of Greta Garbo drew the attention of the paper.",
        "As the U. S. Supreme Court heads into the homestretch of its second term, Donald Verrilli, the interim government \u2019 s chief judge, will not be there. After five years as Attorney general, he is turning over the throne to his successor, leaving a legacy he describes as \u201d reaching the mountaintop \u201d of constitutional law. The day after Verrilli submitted his resignation, he sat down with me in his office for what amounted to an exit hearing.",
        "After 140 years in existence, the Buenos Aires Province in Argentina \u2019 s capital wants to move almost all of its 2, 500 cattle to natural reserves. Those either too old or infirm to make the move will stay, but will no longer be allowed on public exhibit. The Museum will become an educational where fish rescued from the trade may be helped and housed.",
        "The United Kingdom \u2019 s vote to leave the European Union has exposed a generational crisis. A poll by Lord Ashcroft showed that 73 percent of voters between 18 and 24 years old voted to leave part of the EU, while 60 percent of voters age 65 and over opted to leave. The older minority may have won the vote, but it will be the younger Britons who will have to live longer with the UK. The British novelist Anthony Cleave, author of Everyone Alive is Forgiven, was disappointed by the outcome.",
        "The Supreme Court has overturned a Texas statute requiring clinics that give abortions to have surgical facilities and clinics to have admitting privileges at a state hospital. The law was intended to close many hospitals and further reduce availability of abortion in Texas the court has held the law violated the constitution. With a decision in Whole Woman \u2019 s Health v. Hellerstedt, the Court reversed a decision by the 5th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which had upheld the law.",
        "The U. S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously in a vote that domestic abusers accused of misdemeanors can be barred from owning guns. The majority opinion, delivered by Justice Elena Kagan, states that misdemeanor assault convictions for domestic violence are sufficient to invoke a statewide ban on firearms ownership. The plaintiffs in this case, Stephen Voisine and Michael Armstrong, both of Maine, had pleaded guilty in state courts to misdemeanor assault charges after punching or shoving their romantic relationship.",
        "In a decision striking down key aspects of a national abortion law reform, the Supreme Court cast doubt on similar measures in nearly states. At issue in the court \u2019 s decision were three specific provisions of a state law to restrict abortions authorized by the Texas Legislature in 2013. The case before the court required doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital no more than 30 miles from the state clinic and required medical clinics to meet the same health and safety standards as ambulatory pregnancy centers that perform much more complicated procedures.",
        "( Be warned, intrepid reader : This story contains tons of spoilers regarding every episode from this season \u2019 s run of Game of Thrones, including Sunday \u2019 s season finale. ) This was the season that Game of Thrones seriously changed its appearance. Nowhere was that more evident than in Sunday \u2019 s season finale, the last of 10 episodes that pulled together events and characters spread throughout the show \u2019 s mythical fictional kingdoms \u2014 and beyond.",
        "Do we even expect July through December? For a decade just reaching its midpoint, 2016 has already been the most. Heartbreaking, chaotic, idiotic, ecstatic, exhausting. With apologies to whatever happened in the last week of January, the greatest mood swings of the previous six months started for music lovers the days when David Bowie completed his final masterpiece, Blackstar, and then vanished into eternity two months later, leaving us all gasping. The music critic, as it has done for four years, attempted to follow in his footsteps, and even if that feeling of whiplash was felt only once ( R.",
        "Most children in the United States do not drink enough water, and when it\u2019s hot outside, they may need to drink even more. But getting children to drink water can be a challenge. We spoke with medical experts, coaches, camp counselors and parents to find out how much water kids should drink in the summer, and how adults can help make sure they\u2019re getting enough. How much water should kids drink on a hot day? The Institute of Medicine offers recommendations that children ages 4 to 8 should drink about 2 quarts a day.",
        "At the BET Awards on Sunday night, after receiving the network\u2019s humanitarian award, Jesse Williams began with the usual litany of thanks. Standing with a slight hunch over a microphone, he celebrated his parents and his wife. With that out of the way, the real speech began. \u201dThis award, this is not for me,\u201d the activist and Grey\u2019s Anatomy star said. He honored activists, civil rights attorneys, parents, teachers, and \u201dthe students that are realizing that a system built to divide and impoverish and destroy us cannot stand if we do.\u201d He particularly celebrated black women.",
        "How would you like to be remembered, in a word or two? That question was posed by a black man and answered by other black men in a multimedia art project called \u201dQuestion Bridge: Black Males.\u201d Some of the answers to that query included \u201dwarrior,\u201d \u201dsincere,\u201d \u201dmotivated,\u201d \u201ddedicated,\u201d \u201d \u201d and \u201dfather.\u201d A group of black artists created \u201dQuestion Bridge\u201d and they\u2019re getting an Infinity Award this coming week from the International Center of Photography, recognizing their achievement in new media.

        "When Greg Burel tells people he\u2019s in charge of some secret government warehouses, he often gets asked if they\u2019re like the one at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark, where the Ark of the Covenant gets packed away in a crate and hidden forever. \u201dWell, no, not really,\u201d says Burel, director of a program called the Strategic National Stockpile at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
        "It was April 15, 2009, in the depths of the financial crisis. Elizabeth Warren was backstage at The Daily Show, about to make her national TV debut, but her head was not in the clouds. It was in the toilet. She was throwing up. \u201dI had stage fright \u2014 stage fright,\u201d she would later write. Warren was a nobody on the American political scene at the time. A Harvard Law School bankruptcy professor, she had been tapped by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to head up a committee overseeing the disbursement and repayment of bank bailout funds.",
        "The past month has not been kind to Donald Trump. He has landed in controversy on everything from how much he (eventually) gave to veterans groups to Trump University (and the judge who he declared biased because of his Mexican heritage) to his response to the Orlando shooting. National polling has certainly reflected that \u2014 Hillary Clinton has opened up a lead in the RealClearPolitics average of the polls after the two were tied at the end of May. But Trump continues to be competitive in places like Ohio and Pennsylvania because of white voters.",
        "Aboard a flight home from Armenia, Pope Francis fielded a pointed question from reporters: Did he agree with German Cardinal Reinhard Marx, who, in the wake of the Orlando shooting, said gays deserve an apology from the Church? His answer was frank.",
        "In the United States, if a hospital didn\u2019t have running water even for one day, it\u2019d be a crisis. But in some parts of the world, that\u2019s business as usual. Researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health looked at studies on 430 hospitals in 19 and countries. In an article published online in the Journal of Surgical Research, they reported that a third of the hospitals surveyed \u2014 a total of 147 \u2014 did not have continuous running water.",
        "The Toast \u2014 funny and literary feminist website, gleeful kneecapper of high culture, omphalos of cheerful misandry and habitat of the rare courteous and informative comments section \u2014 is closing. The site, launched three years ago by Nicole Cliffe and Mallory Ortberg, will stop publishing July 1.

        "It\u2019s been two weeks since a gunman ended the lives of 49 victims and injured dozens of others at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. As survivors heal and a community embraces the wounded and honors the dead, questions linger about what happened that night \u2014 and how the U. S. would respond after its deadliest mass shooting in recent history. Many details of the attack still aren\u2019t known.",
        "President Obama and his counterparts from Canada and Mexico are preparing to unveil an ambitious new goal for generating power when they meet this week in Ottawa. The three leaders are expected to set a target for North America to get 50 percent of its electricity from nonpolluting sources by 2025. That\u2019s up from about 37 percent last year. Aides acknowledge that\u2019s a \u201dstretch goal,\u201d requiring commitments over and above what the three countries agreed to as part of the Paris climate agreement. \u201dWe do ambitious well here at the White House,\u201d said spokesman Eric Schultz.",
        "One of the country\u2019s leading poultry companies, Perdue Farms, announced plans Monday to make both life and death a little easier for its chickens.

Jim Perdue, chairman of Perdue Farms, says there\u2019s a simple motivation behind the new initiative.

        "There was a time when it wasn\u2019t even clear Sen. Elizabeth Warren would endorse Hillary Clinton. That time has passed. As they took the stage together Monday in Cincinnati, the two politicians locked arms, waved (the old half wave move) and smiled widely. Warren is among the names buzzed about as a possible pick for vice president on a Clinton ticket. Any questions about chemistry were answered today. \u201dI\u2019m here today, because I\u2019m with her, yes her,\u201d Warren said, alluding to a popular slogan of support for Clinton, to roaring applause from a capacity crowd at the Union Terminal.",

        "From the moment it became clear Britain would be leaving the European Union, the Obama administration has been effusive in emphasizing the bond between the two nations. Secretary of State John Kerry reiterated in London on Monday that the U. S. \u201dcould not ask for a better friend and ally\u201d than the U. K. The partnership has meant the White House more often than not relies on Britain to help garner broader European when it comes to major security, trade or foreign policy issues, such as Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine.",
        "In a unanimous decision, the U. S. Supreme Court threw out the corruption conviction of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell. \u201dThere is no doubt that this case is distasteful it may be worse than that,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court. \u201dBut our concern is not with tawdry tales of Ferraris, Rolexes, and ball gowns.",
