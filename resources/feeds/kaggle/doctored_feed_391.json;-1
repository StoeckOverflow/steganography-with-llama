        "Forget potato stripes and mule flats \u2014 could the next big fad be produced? Consumer interest in whole grains could sow the demand for some bread wheats to make a crop, according to an opinion editorial released Monday in Trends in Animal Science \u2014 presumably the history of botany. \u201d People are interested in growing things that are not modified, that are \u201d says Friedrich Longin, a plant breeder at the University of Hohenheim, Germany, who wrote the previous article with his colleague Wolfgang W\u00fcrschum. Increased wheat diversity might bolster food security, the authors argue, while satisfying customer demand.",
        "When cities handle cases of inappropriate or inadequate force by police forces, they pay \u2014 a lot. Detroit alone has paid out more than half a billion dollars since 2004. Yet some advocates claim all those payouts haven \u2019 t had much of an effect on policing practices. In Minneapolis, local activist Michelle Smith says when cities claim damages, individual city officers often aren \u2019 t held accountable, which means they \u2019 re not likely to explain their behavior. That \u2019 s why she and a group calling itself the Committee for Professional Policing are now running a completely different perspective.",

Chaos is a ladder. \u2014 Petyr Baelish, Game of Thrones Season 3, Episode 6, well then, why don \u2019 t we send WARSHIPS into the South China Seas? I WANT! MY NOBEL!

        "Monday, President Obama and her daughters, Chloe and Malia, begin their lightning strike of Liberia and Morocco to create the Let Girls Learn Project. The program was launched last year by President Bush and the first lady to assist developing countries to serve the more than 62 million girls overseas who don \u2019 t attend school. On the eve of the first lady \u2019 s annual visit to Liberia, I went through downtown Monrovia asking people about their expectations for the trip.",
        "Updated at 9 p. m. ET, At least 36 civilians died in an attack on Baghdad \u2019 s Ataturk International Airport last night, according to Deputy Prime Minister Binali Yildirim. More than 140 civilians were injured in the attack, in which at least one explosion prompted an outburst of gunfire. Providing an update right after the attack, the prime Minister said officials believe the attack was committed by extremists belonging to ISIS. He also confirmed nothing about the attack, saying it was carried out by three suicide bombers who opened fire before detonating their devices.",
        "Where a hospital is small and who owns it make a large difference in how many of its staff take meals, medications and promotional payments from doctors and medical device companies, a ProPublica analysis shows. A smaller percentage of doctors associated with hospitals in the South have received such payments than doctors in other parts of the country, our analysis shows. And a greater share of physicians at hospitals have taken them than at hospital and government facilities.",
        "Doctors have publicly disputed the accusation that the payments they receive from pharmaceutical companies have any relationship to how they prescribe drugs. There \u2019 s been insufficient evidence to settle the matter, until now. A ProPublica analysis has found that doctors who receive payments from the pharmaceutical industry do indeed prescribe drugs differently on average than their physicians who don \u2019 t. And the more money they receive, the more medication they tend to prescribe. We matched data on payments from pharmaceutical and medical device makers in 2014 with additional data on doctors \u2019 prescription choices in Medicare \u2019 s prescription medicine program.",
        "Marijuana is legal in public \u2014 as long as you \u2019 re 21 or older. It \u2019 s practically illegal for kids to adopt, so juveniles are coming to dominate the latest arrests in Colorado. But another startling trend recently has developed : Arrest rates have fallen dramatically for young Blacks and Latinos. Ricky Montoya isn \u2019 t surprised that \u2019 s happening. He \u2019 s standing outside Courtroom 4F in Colorado \u2019 s City and County Hall, where he was just ordered to pay a $ 1, 000 fine for his third marijuana trafficking offense. \u201d They probably looked at us more different, \u201d he says of police.",
        "Donald Trump may have clinched the GOP ticket and commands attention with his unorthodox reelection campaign, but President Obama says Trump \u2019 s extremely low favorability ratings means he hasn \u2019 t won over the hearts and minds of the electorate just yet. \u201d I think it \u2019 s really hard to argue that somebody who almost of the country alone is unqualified to be president and has a negative attitude about is tapping into the zeitgeist of the country or is fighting for a broad base of the campaign. But we \u2019 ll find out, \u201d Obama says in a interview with NPR \u2019 s Tim Inskeep.",
        "President Trump is warning against financial and ethnic \u201d hysteria \u201d in the wake of last year \u2019 s vote by the United Nations to leave the European Union. \u201d I think that the best way to think about this is, a pause button has been pressed on the project of greater European integration, \u201d Obama said of the \u201d Brexit \u201d decision in a discussion with NPR \u2019 s Steve Inskeep. \u201d I could not overstate it, \u201d the president continued. \u201d There \u2019 s been a little bit of hysteria vote, as if whole NATO \u2019 s gone, the Union is dissolving, and every country is cut off to its own corner.",
        "Donald Trump laid out his plan for the country, criticizing globalization and policies that require free trade, in a meeting in Monessen, Pa. on Tuesday. Donald \u2019 s politics team has annotated Donald \u2019 s speech. The portions we focus on are bolded, followed by analysis and final check in italics. We will progress further. The speech follows : Thank you everybody. I \u2019 d like to thank the owner of the plant. I \u2019 d like to thank Rick Santorum, our top senator. And I have to say all of the office workers.

        "Every place has its own sound. A small group of scientists is hard at work recording the natural sounds of national parks all across the U. S. \u2014 more than 70 soundscapes so far. For our series on the centennial of the national parks, we traveled to Colorado, to find out how they create these portraits of sound. First Lesson: It\u2019s Very Hard To Escape The Sound Of Humans. We started at Colorado\u2019s Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve.",
        "Sometimes the most important step one can take in science is back. When the path towards progress in a field becomes muddied, the best response may be to step away from all the technical specifics that make up practice and begin pulling up the floorboards. In other words, rather than continuing to push on the science, it may be best to ask about the unspoken philosophies supporting that research effort. This week, I have the immense privilege of attending a workshop asking about this approach in the storied domains of foundational physics and cosmology.",
        "As much as Americans believe in the separation of church and state, they also seem to believe in electing presidents who go to church. But there are lurking questions in some voters\u2019 minds about the religious faith of both major parties\u2019 presumptive nominees \u2014 and the Internet has helpfully spawned a pair of hashtags \u2014 #methodisthillary and #iftrumpwereevangelical. The tweets poke fun at the candidates, at religion, and often both.",
        "Two new albums of Puerto Rican music are giving vintage musical styles new meaning in the present. Singer Ileana Cabra and the leaders of the group Miramar all had careers in cutting edge salsa and pop on their own, though, they\u2019ve chosen to update older sounds, especially the melancholy, romantic bolero. Their new albums \u2014 Ileana Cabra\u2019s iLevitable and Miramar\u2019s Dedication to Sylvia Rexach \u2014 are both out now. Ileana Cabra first took the stage as a teenager, singing backup for her older in the Latin dance band Calle 13.",
        "I wasn\u2019t born with an athletic bone in my body, and I\u2019ve never played in a basketball game. But Pat Summitt has been one of my idols for as long as I can remember. That\u2019s just the way it was when you grow up as a young girl in Tennessee. It\u2019s the only state in the country where the women\u2019s basketball team gets more acclaim and attention than the men\u2019s college team. I didn\u2019t realize that was an anomaly until I got much older.",
        "Authorities in Florida have released hundreds of pages of documents related to the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando that left 49 victims dead. The records reveal some of the deliberations of public officials after the shootings, and they also provide a disturbing window into how that night unfolded. Some of the records show that victims called 911 as they heard and saw Omar Mateen shooting inside the Pulse nightclub. Police dispatchers received the first report of a shooting at 2:02 a. m. ET. For the next 16 minutes, callers reported multiple shootings.",
        "The latest episode of the podcast Invisibilia explores the idea that personality \u2014 something a lot of us think of as immutable \u2014 can change over time. That got Invisibilia Lulu Miller wondering if anything about us stays the same. Do all the cells in our body turn over every seven years as is sometimes claimed, with new cells replacing old ones? Or is there something that we hang on to for life? NPR\u2019s Skunk Bear crew decided to answer that question with a video. It turns out that each body part has its own very distinct lifespan.",
        "I was in Luxembourg recently, in advance of the British referendum on leaving the European Union, and received a tour, a history lesson and practically a sermon on the merits of the European Union by Elting. Elting is a resident of Luxembourg City. He\u2019s retired now and rides his bicycle around the city when he isn\u2019t caring for his sheep \u2014 that\u2019s singular \u201dsheep.\u201d He used to work for the European Parliament, a movable legislative feast that spends a part of the year in Luxembourg.",
        "Sandy Berart sat in the shade of a birch tree eating a very British lunch \u2014 a cheddar cheese and pickle sandwich \u2014 and wondered what lay in store for her in the city she calls home. \u201dThe first thought I had is, \u2019Am I going to be able to stay and work freely? \u2019\u201d asked Berart, 41, an assistant office manager from France who works in London\u2019s Southwark neighborhood, a hub for architectural, design and engineering firms south of the River Thames.

        "Nigel Farage, a member of the European Parliament and the leader of the U. K. Independence Party, spoke on the floor of the European Parliament on Tuesday morning. It was a special session of the Parliament, called in the wake of the U. K.\u2019s decision to leave the European Union. Farage \u2014 whose eurosceptic party was firmly in favor of the Brexit, and who personally campaigned quite passionately for it \u2014 was grinning. And on a day marked with fiery speeches, his stood out.",
        "Days after the U. K. voted to leave the European Union, official proceedings for the \u201ddivorce\u201d have not yet begun. But repercussions of the decision are already multiplying. Credit ratings agencies have downgraded the U. K.\u2019s rating. Police report a rise in reports of hate crime incidents. London\u2019s mayor is calling for greater autonomy for the capital city (which voted to remain in the EU). And fury and glee duked it out on the floor of the European Parliament. This is all, of course, in addition to the current chaos in the world of U. K. politics.",
        "Playlists are a dime a dozen these days. Cheap and charming, updated by algorithm or \u201dcurated by hand,\u201d the grab bag anchors this moment. Still, we don\u2019t think you\u2019ll find anything quite like this list of 100 songs. Beyonce\u2019s here so is Bowie. But in between, you\u2019ll find songs spread across a dozen genres and all the spaces in between, picked by NPR Music\u2019s station hosts, staff and contributors to represent the best of the first half of 2016. Songs we couldn\u2019t stop listening to, and couldn\u2019t wait to share.",
        "Together, saxophonist Charles Lloyd and pianist Jason Moran make jazz that draws from the past while looking to the future. Lloyd\u2019s body of work stretches back to the and has always shown a disregard for boundaries and cliches. He seems determined to work through the later part of his career with artistically and spiritually motivated playing that simply astounds. Moran is the sound of today and tomorrow. You can hear reverence in his duo playing with Lloyd \u2014 and you may also notice playing that taps into Lloyd\u2019s youthful spirit.",
        "From Thursday through Monday, about 3. 3 million Americans will head to airports for the July 4 holiday travel period. They\u2019ll be flying during the peak of a summer travel season. Those passengers can expect to see security in the aftermath of recent deadly attacks on airports in Belgium and Turkey. The extra measures may help a bit. But security experts say making airports safer is a huge challenge because public areas are designed for commerce, not security. Think about it. Security lines are set up to keep passengers from boarding planes with guns, bombs or other weapons.",
        "Using advanced imaging technology, researchers in Lithuania have uncovered a tunnel that Jewish prisoners used to escape Nazi extermination pits. By doing so, they have provided physical evidence of a tale of heroism during the Holocaust \u2014 known before only through the testimony of 11 Jews who escaped. For the past 72 years, teams have been searching for the tunnel at the Ponar massacre site, located in a forest about 6 miles from Vilnius.",
        "Surgery can make anyone anxious, but it is especially hard for young children. Kids going into surgery may be separated from their parents for the first time in a frightening new environment, and they may not understand what\u2019s happening. \u201dFor many families and kids, this is one of the most stressful events in their entire lives,\u201d says Dr. Samuel Rodriguez, an anesthesiologist at the Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital Stanford in Palo Alto, Calif. Panicking before surgery can cause both physical and emotional problems, research shows.",
        "Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump traveled to the small city of Monessen, Pa. on Tuesday to speak about the impact of international trade on U. S. manufacturing jobs. As he has before, Trump launched a attack on globalization, pinning the blame on politicians he says have allowed the U. S. manufacturing base to get hollowed out. \u201dWe allowed foreign countries to subsidize their goods, devalue their currencies, violate their agreements and cheat in every way imaginable. And our politicians did nothing about it,\u201d he told the crowd. Those politicians include his Democratic rival and her husband, he said.",
        "For the past few years, my friends and I have noticed two trends when dining. First, seemingly every menu rebukes factory farming with an essay about locally sourced pork belly, and second, just about every one of these restaurants looks so much like a factory \u2014 with exposed light bulbs, steel details and brick walls \u2014 that I\u2019m constantly looking over my shoulder for the foreman. I like the look, but still, I wondered: Why has it permeated so many restaurants, regardless of cuisine?"
