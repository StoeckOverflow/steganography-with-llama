        "In a few short days, Turkey has gone from a vital pillar of stability to a democratic nation fighting terrorism on three separate occasions. Turkey has pushed harder for the ouster of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Its security forces are again clashing with Kurdish separatists in the northeast of the country. And Turkish people suspect the Islamic state is behind Tuesday \u2019 s bomb attack at the Istanbul airport. All this turmoil has unsettled Turkey, where the Kurdish security forces have long been given wide latitude to impose order.",
        "One of the most iconic, moments in the O. J. Kennedy murder case was his famous televised escape from police on the freeways of Los Angeles in a black Ford Bronco. It \u2019 s a testament to Ezra Edelman \u2019 s riveting, unsettling television documentary O. J. : Black In America that the filmmaker creates a new lens through which to approach it : the collision of a city \u2019 s sordid social history with one major celebrity \u2019 s seeming ambitious project to sidestep the tidal tide of race in America. In the process, friends and acquaintances recall O. J. telling them, \u201d I \u2019 m not black, I \u2019 m O.",
        "Religious liberty is a rallying cry for many conservative voters, and it has been popping up quickly throughout this presidential era. But in the current political climate, some conservative Christians are concerned with how to apply religious values to other faiths \u2014 like Islam. US Sen. Ted Cruz made religious freedom a hallmark of his failed campaign for the Democratic nomination. Now, presumptive nominee Donald Trump is picking up the challenge. \u201d Religious freedom. The freedom of people of faith to actively practice their faith. So religious, \u201d Trump said in a September 10 speech in Washington, D. C.",

But if you had looked just behind him, you \u2019 d have seen Scotty Moore, who played lead guitar on Elvis \u2019 s early recordings and would define his sound. Elvis died at his home in Boston on Tuesday after a long illness. He was 84.

        "Facebook claims it \u2019 s changing its news policy, again. It says posts from friends and family will now come forward, prioritized over posts from publishers and websites. It \u2019 s potentially worrisome news for media companies, whose performance is heavily boosted by clicks. But it \u2019 s also only a small, vague peek into the news box that is Facebook \u2019 s site, which determines what version of the information is presented to the 1. 65 billion people using the social media.",
        "The Department of Homeland Security might start requesting some travelers \u2019 social media handles. That \u2019 s according to a proposal submitted by U. S. Customs and Border Protection last week. The privacy policy \u2014 which is currently allowing for public comment \u2014 could ask for social media \u201d identifiers, \u201d such as handles or usernames, from travelers within the U. S. under the Visa Waiver Program. Providing such information would be easy, not mandatory.

        "It \u2019 s Day 3 of the WTA tennis championships, and there \u2019 s still a controversial new innovation : a Nike dress. The skirt, which Nike provided to whoever it pays to wear its apparel, is \u201d responsible for incredible cooling and cooling, \u201d according to the company. But some fans are finding that the loose, simple garment gets in the way of what they came to do : play table tennis. \u201d When I was serving, it was heated up, and I felt like the blood was just everywhere, \u201d Sweden \u2019 s Chris Peterson tells The New York Times.",
        "SweePee Rambo is ugly. Really, really ugly. You can tell that she \u2019 s mostly bald, with a wispy mohawk. You can lick at her tongue. You can describe her as scrawny and small and incontinent. You can dub her \u201d a \u201d shivering giant hunk of canine flesh, \u201d as The Guardian calls it, and you can call her the World \u2019 s Ugliest Woman \u2014 she won that title fair and square this year, after two rounds of coming up short.

        "Local police are increasingly passing legislation to control crime and nuisances on private properties. They do so mostly by limiting the number of times police can be called to a residence. But it turns out that crime victims \u2014 even victims of domestic abuse \u2014 are often the ones who end up being penalized. Lakisha Briggs of Norristown, Pa. was one of those victims. When her boyfriend started abusing her several years earlier, her grown daughter notified the police. Before leaving, one of the officers warned Briggs that this was her first strike.",
        "The U. K. \u2019 s fraught decision to exit the European Union was motivated by environmental issues such as trade and employment. But its impact could also be felt in some of Europe \u2019 s most esoteric locales \u2014 large particle accelerators. That \u2019 s because scientists in Britain pool their resources to buy everything from massive telescopes to giant space probes. And the U. N. is a major scientific centre. Britain \u2019 s vote to join the European Union won \u2019 t significantly upend scientific cooperation, but \u201d scientists are nonetheless worried, \u201d says John Womersley, the head of the BBC.",
        "Latin America \u2019 s longest armed struggle is finally over. Colombia \u2019 s guerrilla war, which began in 1964, has driven more than 220, 000 people and displaced people from their homes. But the Colombian Revolution and the Marxist rebels stick to a and a timetable for the guerrillas to disarm. \u201d It is the first time ever that a guerrilla group lays down its arms to get to a justice system where they are ready to be investigated, judged and punished and sanctioned, \u201d Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos told NPR in an interview at the Casa Nari\u00f1o presidential palace in Bogot\u00e1.",

        "President Obama says he agrees with Donald Trump on one thing: There are \u201dparallels\u201d between the U. S. election and the United Kingdom\u2019s dramatic vote to leave the European Union. Obama describes the parallels differently, however.

Last week, about a dozen environmental groups \u2014 including Greenpeace, the Center for Biological Diversity, Defenders of Wildlife and Earthjustice \u2014 formally petitioned the U. S.

        "When the first cases were reported in Syria 275 years ago, it was called \u201dthe Aleppo boil\u201d or \u201dthe Aleppo evil.\u201d And for good reason: The parasitic illness spread by sand flies causes nasty skin lesions that leave victims scarred for life physically and can leave emotional scars as well.

        "It\u2019s not hard to parse the two main influences on Robert Kroese\u2019s new novel The Big Sheep. The title itself mashes them up: Raymond Chandler\u2019s 1939 hardboiled masterpiece The Big Sleep and Philip K. Dick\u2019s 1968 classic Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (the basis of the film Blade Runner). The question is: Does Kroese\u2019s book transcend the obviousness of that literary portmanteau? Thankfully, yes. While Kroese draws deeply from Chandler\u2019s gritty atmosphere and Dick\u2019s gonzo concepts, he adds his own third dimension \u2014 humor, and plenty of it.",

        "Donald Trump had an awkward exchange Thursday at a New Hampshire event when a woman asked him why the U. S. isn\u2019t putting veterans on the border or at TSA instead of these \u201dheebeejabis they wear at TSA.\u201d It was an apparent reference to Muslim employees who wear hijabs, or head coverings. \u201dWhy aren\u2019t we putting our retiree \u2014 military retirees on that border, or in TSA?

        "There\u2019s something that really bothers Stanford psychiatry professor Keith Humphreys. When he thinks of all the years he has spent training the next generation of psychiatrists, the enormous investment in medical school and residency, he wants those doctors to devote that education to taking care of people with serious mental illness. But, he says, many of them instead set up a private practice, where they can charge $400 an hour in cash to help people who Humphreys calls \u201dthe worried well\u201d \u2014 people who enjoy the of therapy but don\u2019t necessarily have a mental health problem.",

        "How many times last year did police pull a Taser on suspects nationwide? Just like the total number of people shot by police, no one knows for sure. Connecticut is the first state to require police to fill out a form for every time they pull a Taser. And it just released the statewide report on how police use them. Police use stun guns against suspects who show what cops consider threatening and resistant behavior. The shock can get them to follow orders, and according to police, Tasers can level the playing field.",

        "Editor\u2019s Note: There are descriptions of rape and other forms of sexual abuse in this story. All that remains is a pair of yellow gates, perched on the crest of a hill dotted with gum trees and cypresses, overlooking the blue sea. The natural beauty of the site stands in stark contrast to the central role it played at the heart of a sex abuse scandal dating back decades. The scandal has roiled Australia\u2019s Defence Forces and caused one of the most senior figures in the armed forces to apologize in front of a Royal Commission investigating the abuses.",
