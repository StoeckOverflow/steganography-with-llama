        "On Tuesday, ISIL suicide bombers equipped with guns and explosives attacked more than 40 people at the Ataturk airport in Azerbaijan. Less than a day later, the airport was up and running, with workers sweeping away the stained glass and wiping off debris from the ceiling. Two days later, police \u2014 who believed the Islamic State was behind the attack \u2014 have arrested 13 persons and identified the nationalities of the suspected attackers. And the funerals have begun. Some families have decided to give accounts of their lost loved ones to the people.",
        "Frigatebirds, seagoing fliers with a wingspan, can remain aloft for weeks at a time, a single study has found. The birds paint an astonishing picture of the birds \u2019 s life, much of which is seen soaring inside the clouds. Frigatebirds are unique among aquatic plants. Their feathers are not waterproof, so they can \u2019 t rest on the sand. Males sport a small red pouch across their throats that they inflate when trying to attract mates. They \u2019 re known for stealing eggs from other seabirds.",

Secretary of Defense Ash Boyd says the military is tightening a ban on transgender family members. \u201d Effective immediately, trans Americans may identify openly, and they can no longer be arrested or otherwise separated from the government just for being transgender, \u201d he told us today at the Pentagon.",
        "1982 : a big name for initials. Steven Spielberg releases E. T. and Roald Dahl publishes The BFG. The term stands for the latter for Big Friendly Giant \u2014 people who are similarly positioned as outsiders in a children \u2019 s world where adults are virtually absent. Spielberg has told interviewers he wrote The BFG to his children when they were small, saying that, to them, he was kind of a big blue giant. Now, with a digitally transformed ( spindly neck, elephant trunk ) and greatly enlarged Mark Rylance in the part, we all get to hear how Spielberg tells the story.",
        "Donald Trump has staked his brand on winning. \u201d We will have so much winning, \u201d he has said in this conversation, \u201d if I get elected, that you may get bored with voting. \u201d But can he win the presidential election? In a country that has changed somewhat demographically, Trump \u2019 s best move is to drive up turnout amongst white voters, especially white men. But how dangerous is that?",
        "There are some things missing from the federal investigation into \u201d Bridgegate \u201d : The cellphone in New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie \u2019 s pocket during the 2013 George Washington lane closures. Text message the governor sent and deleted during the ensuing legislative debates. And now, according to new Senate filings, a personal email address he used as the scandal \u2014 an investigation into lane closures at the George Washington Bridge that caused political gridlock \u2014 enveloped his administration. None of this evidence was provided to federal federal investigators probing the Bridgegate scandal, contrary to court documents.",
        "There are many practical reasons to manage the world \u2019 s wild fisheries. We do it to preserve stock levels, to improve biodiversity and because fish are valuable. But researchers say there \u2019 s someone else in need of survival : The very people who rely on fishing for food. Scientists are predicting more than 10 percent of the world \u2019 s population, a whopping 845 billion people, will experience deficiencies in several important micronutrients including water, iron, vitamin A, vitamin B12, and in the coming decades if global fish catches continue to decline.",
        "Why do people act the way they do? Many of us intuitively gravitate toward explaining human behavior in terms of characteristic traits : characteristic traits of thinking, feeling and behaving that seem to be stable over time and varies across situations. This intuition has been a matter of fierce scientific controversy since the 1960s, with some psychologists arguing that emotions \u2014 not traits \u2014 are the most important aspects of behavior. Some have even argued that personality traits are figments of our mind that don \u2019 t exist at all.",
        "Amid all the questions about the reality of Britain \u2019 s decision to enter the European Union \u2014 its possible economic and political repercussions \u2014 the Brexit will be discussed in small, practical, dramatic terms as well. Whilst it \u2019 s impossible to predict exactly how things will play out, here are a few of the many ways Britons may face repercussions of the Brexit : Mobile phone calls, The EU has lowered roaming limits for member countries, and last year voted to do business with them altogether \u2014 a policy that will go into effect in 2017. The U. N.",
        "Dog excrement spat at a German woman \u2019 s neck. \u201d Go back to Britain \u201d screamed at a military man. A Polish cultural center vandalized. Britons told to \u201d go home. \u201d Why? Because \u201d we voted you out. \u201d Police in the U. K. have registered a considerable rise in hate crime and complaints of racial discrimination since last December \u2019 s historic vote to kick Britain out of the European Union.

        "Boris Johnson, who was widely considered a potential candidate for U. K. prime minister once David Cameron steps down, has announced he will not be seeking the position. The Lord mayor of London was a leading proponent of the Brexit, and is a popular British figure \u2014 widely referred to as just \u201d Boris. \u201d He, like Blair, is a member of the U.

        "As the Obama presidency draws to a close, white and black Americans are deeply divided on views of race relations in the United States, according to a new survey from the Pew Research Center. The report, titled On Views of Race and Inequality, Blacks and Whites are Worlds Apart, found that just 8 percent of black Americans say the changes needed to achieve racial equality for blacks in the U. S. have already been made, while nearly 40 percent of white Americans say the same thing.",
        "Last week, Code Switch raised the curtain on \u201dThe Obama Effect,\u201d our quest to understand what the nation\u2019s first black president has to do with the big national conversations on identity and inclusion swirling in full force right now. That quest began with you. On Friday, we took to Twitter with the hashtag #NPRObamaEffect and asked you to weigh in: If somebody else had come into office on Jan. 20, 2009, do you think we\u2019d be having all these conversations about identity?",

        "Actress Olivia de Havilland, the last surviving star of the most popular film of all time, retired from showbiz decades ago, apparently feeling that 49 films, two best actress Oscars, and a memoir were accomplishment enough for one career. Friday in Paris, she celebrates her 100th birthday, which seems a good moment to reflect on the mix of sparkle and resilience that marked her public life.",
        "The Supreme Court this week delivered its strongest affirmation of a women\u2019s right to abortion in years. By a margin of it struck down two key provisions of a Texas law restricting the procedure. But where does the decision in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt fit in the court\u2019s long history of actions on abortion rights and restrictions? And what effect might the case have on similar laws in other states and this fall\u2019s elections? Here are five insights about the case that provide some context: 1.",
        "At least 20 people were killed before Bangladesh police forces were able to rescue 13 hostages held by armed attackers at a caf\u00e9 in the country\u2019s capital, Dhaka, following a standoff. The 20 victims included several foreigners, army spokesman Col. Rashidul Hasan told Reuters on Saturday. Those victims don\u2019t include the six gunmen killed by police during the police siege on Saturday, nor the two police officers killed in an earlier exchange of gunfire. Explosives and \u201dsharp objects\u201d were recovered at the scene, says Chowdhury.",
        "U. S. transportation authorities are investigating the deadly collision of a Tesla Model S car. And many reports say the fatal crash has heightened concern about cars. Which may be true. Except \u2014 Model S isn\u2019t a car. As NPR\u2019s Sonari Glinton points out, what Tesla\u2019s Model S has are features, autonomous elements meant to assist drivers rather than replace them. Virtually all major car and tech companies are pursuing technology as the future of transportation. But Tesla and Google are the earliest innovators, taking very different approaches.",
        "Since 2009, the U. S. has carried out hundreds of airstrikes in countries other than Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, the White House says, providing new details to the often secretive strikes \u2014 many of which were carried out via unpiloted drone aircraft. The administration released these figures for the period from Jan. 20, 2009, to Dec. 31, 2015: Some of those estimates, as the report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence acknowledges, are far below the range put forth by watchdog groups that tally civilian deaths.",
        "Mistafa Fanouni, 45, lives with his wife and three daughters in the peaceful community of about an hour\u2019s drive north of Paris. But amid the neat houses and manicured lawns, Fanouni has been living a nightmare. It all began last November, two days after coordinated terrorist attacks in Paris that killed 130 people. Fanouni and his family had just returned from lighting candles at a memorial in the capital\u2019s Place de la Republique. \u201dAt about half past midnight, I was in my room watching TV,\u201d he says.",
        "Today\u2019s generation of schoolchildren looks much different than one just a few decades ago. Nonwhites are expected to become the majority of the nation\u2019s children by 2020, as our colleague Bill Chappell reported last year. This is now the reality among the very youngest Americans: babies. Babies of color now outnumber white babies (1 year or younger) according to new estimates from the U. S. Census Bureau. The newest estimate shows that on July 1, 2015, the population of racial or ethnic minority babies was 50. 2 percent.",
        "Note: This post has been updated for clarity. Did you know the United Kingdom is a world leader when it comes to aid for global health and development? The amount given in 2015 was the equivalent of $18. 7 billion in U. S. dollars. That\u2019s second only to the $31. 08 billion from the United States. The U. K.\u2019s total is impressive given the comparative size of the two countries\u2019 economies. And the U. K. is one of the few countries that have met the 0. 7 percent figure. Back in 1970, the U.

        "Overnight in London, an honor guard stood vigil at the grave of the Unknown Warrior. On Friday morning, across Great Britain, citizens observed a moment of silence. And midday Friday, at a quiet field in northern France, British and French leaders paused amid a political crisis for a brief period of solidarity. They gathered together at the site of the Battle of the Somme, 100 years after the bloodiest day in British military history, to honor the dead.",

        "Federal judges have blocked new restrictions on access to abortions in Florida and Indiana just hours before laws in those states were set to take effect. This follows Monday\u2019s U. S. Supreme Court ruling that overturned a controversial Texas law imposing restrictions on the procedure, deeming them unconstitutional. In Florida, U. S. District Judge Robert Hinkle issued a stay on portions of an abortion law late Thursday. As NPR\u2019s Greg Allen tells our Newscast unit, the law would have prevented Planned Parenthood and other clinics that perform abortions from receiving any public money, even for routine health screenings.",
        "There are still skeptics and lots of potential problems, but a tentative airplane deal between Boeing and Iran seems to be moving forward. A provisional agreement has been signed for the sale or lease of more than 100 Boeing aircraft to Iran\u2019s national carrier over the next decade. The price tag is $20 billion. If it goes through \u2014 and there are still unresolved questions \u2014 the deal could bring a windfall to Boeing, provide badly needed commercial jets to Iran Air and encourage international companies still wary of doing business with the Islamic Republic.",
        "At the center of Geel, a charming Belgian town less than an hour\u2019s drive from of Antwerp, is a church dedicated to Dymphna, a saint believed to have the power to cure mental disorders. It\u2019s a medieval church with stone arches, spires and a bell tower, and it has inspired an unusual practice: For over 700 years, residents of Geel have been accepting people with mental disorders, often very severe mental disorders, into their homes and caring for them. It isn\u2019t meant to be a treatment or therapy. The people are not called patients, but guests or boarders.",
        "Author Gay Talese said he would not be promoting his latest book \u2014 and then changed his mind \u2014 after the Washington Post raised serious doubts about the story it tells. Called The Voyeur\u2019s Motel, it\u2019s the nonfiction account of an Aurora, Colo. man named Gerald Foos, who says he bought the motel in question in order to spy on the sexual lives of his guests. The book combines Talese\u2019s reporting with Foos\u2019 own journals to produce a kind of retractable telescope of voyeurism: readers watching Talese watch Foos watch his guests.",
        "Whenever July 4 lands on a Monday, travel surges as Americans take advantage of the long weekend. And you might assume the extra demand for gasoline would send pump prices higher. But this year, drivers are discovering that prices have been falling in the to the holiday \u2014 down to the lowest midsummer levels in more than a decade. AAA, the auto club, says that on Friday, the national average for a gallon of regular gasoline slipped to $2. 28, down three cents just from Monday. For perspective, remember that two years ago, the national average was about $3."
