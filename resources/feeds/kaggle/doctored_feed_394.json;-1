        "As President Clinton \u2019 s administration draws to a close, observers \u2014 and the president himself \u2014 are losing stock of his legacy on democracy in America. In a interview this month with NPR \u2019 s Steve Inskeep, McCain responded to critics among people of color who feel that, despite their overwhelming defeat at the ballot box, the race hasn \u2019 t done enough to deliver results for their communities. \u201d I \u2019 m also reminding young Republicans, who are full of passion, that I need them to keep their passion, \u201d Clinton said.",
        "So you think that whatever you brewed in your kitchen is ready for another time, and you \u2019 re thinking, \u201d perhaps I should take the plunge and set up a new craft brewery. \u201d You \u2019 re not the only one with dreams infused with hops and malting barley. During the past couple of years, new breweries were being started at the rate of three a week in the U. S. New World Brewing is one of them. It just popped up in a box in an Arlington, Va. park.",
        "Though no nomination should have been necessary, the presumptive White House nominees of both major candidates each got one this year : No matter how unique a unique personality may appear, no one runs for president alone. What others think you do and say can hurt you, and those next to you can hurt you the most. Exhibit A is, of course, the night that former president Bill Clinton met briefly with Attorney General Loretta Cruz at the Phoenix airport this year. Both have said it was a chance meeting, a social visit with something about family, not business.",
        "Attorney general Loretta Lynch said she \u201d strongly expects \u201d to endorse the recommendations of state prosecutors and FBI investigators investigating the security of Hillary Clinton \u2019 s email practices, but stopped short of recusing herself from the heavily charged case. In an interview in Aspen, Colo. Lynch stated she regrets that her unscheduled meeting with former President Bill Clinton on a Miami airport tarmac this week has \u201d left a shadow \u201d over the investigation into his son \u2019 s email practices at the Defense Department.",
        "The contestants get flowers in their hair. And feathers. And brightly colored shoes. They parade around. They \u2019 re judged. The winner gets a tiara, flower cakes, jars of honey and a coupon for a beautiful haircut. Welcome to the goat riding contest in Remygala, Lithuania, a venue of about 1, 700 people. Videos of the event, which is marking its seventh year, are making the rounds on the Internet. This season \u2019 s winner is a ruminant named Demyte, which means \u201d little spot. \u201d In short, Demyte has two black stripes on her coat.",
        "The Legend of Tarzan, starring Alexander Skarsgard, plays in theaters today. It \u2019 s only the seventh in a very long line of movies of Edgar Rice Burroughs \u2019 noble, savage in books, film, radio, comic strips, comic strips and on film. Burroughs always acknowledged that his version of Tarzan borrowed much from Kipling. It can \u2019 t help but show : the stink of colonialism, cultural stereotyping and the cringeworthy narrative of The White Savior have always clung to the character.",
        "Edgar Rice Burroughs published the first of his Tarzan stories in 1912, just four months after, as the opening title sequence of the The Legend Of Tarzan telling us, Belgium \u2019 s King Leopold II was forced to cede control of the \u201d Congo Free State \u201d to the Belgian crown. He \u2019 d spent the prior tens of decades enslaving millions of natives of the Congo and using their manual labor to extract the country \u2019 s rubber, diamonds, and other materials for his personal enrichment.",
        "Almost at the last minute, a federal judge has declared a controversial Florida law unconstitutional. The measure, HB 1523, would have protected unconstitutional objections to gay rights, extramarital sex and transgender rights. The judge says it favored some religious beliefs over abortion and would codify unequal treatment of homosexual people. The state \u2019 s attorney has said he looks forward to an appeal, but Mississippi \u2019 s attorney general has expressed concerns over appealing the case. As the has previously reported, the \u201d Protecting Freedom of Conscience from Drug Discrimination Act \u201d was described by its proponents as a press freedom bill.",
        "Suki Kim spent 10 years researching and researching North Korea. In 2011, she spent six months working at a university in Pyongyang \u2014 and working began as a journalist. During that time, Kim secretly documented the experiences of 270 of North Korea \u2019 s population \u2014 young men who were being groomed as the country \u2019 s future leaders \u2014 at the end of the country \u2019 s regime changes. Kim \u2019 s reporting grew into the book Without You, There Is No Justice, which \u2014 much to her dismay \u2014 was written as a memoir.",
        "We have to posit first that baking itself can feel like fire. A simple loaf of bread must include only flour, butter, yeast and salt, and it can easily transform from a sticky blob to a pillowy product with a texture unlike anywhere else you \u2019 ve ever seen to a final product that \u2019 s almost crisp on the outside, perfectly tender on the inside. Not only that, but it will audibly crackle at you as it cools on the skin. It will pass through a perfect environment for consumption, and then that moment will be forgotten.",
        "At first, I was sucked in by Adia Victoria \u2019 s languid guitar sound : In her hands, it practically has a drawl of its own. Then I imagined her stories \u2014 never trite, never personal, always funny \u2014 which you can hear in the words that follow her Tiny Desk concert.",
        "Holocaust survivor, Nobel laureate and author Elie Wiesel has died at the age of 87. Wiesel survived the World War II Nazi concentration camp of Buchenwald and concentration camp of Auschwitz.

        "Bangladeshi militants raided an upscale cafe one Saturday in the capital, Dhaka, ending an standoff with a group of gunmen. The Bangladesh military said 20 terrorists were killed, along with six police officers and two attackers. Police arrested one of the militants at the scene. The gunmen stormed into the Holey Artisan Bakery caf\u00e9 late Friday and took a dozen hostage, including others. The posh neighborhood called Gulshan is home to many foreign embassies. Bangladesh \u2019 s prime minister Sheikh Hasina has announced two days of national mourning, as the media reported. In a televised address, she vowed to eradicate terrorism.",
        "As the Supreme Court\u2019s term comes to an end, here are some takeaways: The signal event in the term was not a decision but a death. The court lost its current member, Antonin Scalia, who died in February at age 79. Scalia had been appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 and had long been the court\u2019s intellectual anchor on the right. Scalia strove to read the Constitution as written and resisted efforts to expand its meaning or intent.",
        "Mental illness has been part of human society throughout recorded history, but how we care for people with mental disorders has changed radically, and not always for the better. In Colonial days, settlers lived in sparsely populated rural communities where sanctuary and community support enabled the tradition of family care brought from England. \u201dDistracted persons\u201d were acknowledged, but erratic behavior wasn\u2019t associated with disease. Records indicate unusual tolerance of bizarre behavior.",
        "The novel Valley of the Dolls turns fifty this year \u2014 and it still looks fabulous. Maybe it\u2019s the nips and tucks, or the booze and pills \u2014 you know, the dolls \u2014 or the backstabbing. Or the bonking. If, for some reason you have not come across this book in your literary travels \u2014 or maybe you\u2019re pretending you haven\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s the seamy Hollywood showbiz story of three women, Anne Welles, Jennifer North and Neely O\u2019Hara. The book broke all kinds of sales records in 1966, despite the critics.",
        "For most of her career, Carmen Herrera\u2019s paintings of brightly colored geometric shapes went unnoticed, while her male counterparts \u2014 Barnett Newman, Ellsworth Kelly and Frank Stella \u2014 got plenty of attention for similar work. Herrera finally made her first sale at 89. And now, at 101, it seems she\u2019s getting her due at last. The Cuban artist\u2019s work can be seen at the Tate in London, MoMA in New York, and she has an exhibition coming to the Whitney Whitney Museum of American Art in September.",
        "There are plenty of iconic trios \u2014 Larry, Curly and Mo. Robin, Maurice and Barry Gibb. Beyonce, Kelly and Michelle. Add President Obama, Justin Trudeau and Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto to that list. This week at the North American Leaders Summit, the presidents of the U. S. Canada and Mexico became a meme of beautiful, albeit awkward, proportions: the #3Amigos. The comparisons were perhaps inevitable. As far as politicians go, the three are all fairly attractive men and they seem to like each other. And they set themselves up with a few moments that were just ripe for Internet playfulness.",
        "For many African nations, their independence is so recent that people still remember the day it happened. Here\u2019s how the continent\u2019s seven most recently independent countries, all of which have declared independence since 1975, celebrate \u2014 or, in one case, decide not to hold festivities. Independence Day: July 9, 2011, from Sudan, The world\u2019s youngest nation previously marked its independence day with military parades. But this year, the government canceled its plans for an official celebration.",
        "A massive bloom of algae has hit four southern Florida counties, blanketing beaches in muck and raising health and environmental concerns. The green goo along Florida\u2019s \u201dTreasure Coast\u201d prompted Gov. Rick Scott to declare a state of emergency in Martin and St. Lucie counties earlier this week, and he later added Lee and Palm Beach counties. Scott \u201dblamed the federal government for neglecting repairs to the lake\u2019s aging dike that\u2019s considered one of the country\u2019s most for imminent failure,\u201d as The Associated Press reported. Republican Sen.",
        "It somehow just seems right the last A Prairie Home Companion with Garrison Keillor will be heard tonight, on this weekend of flags, parades, and lemonade stands. The show was recorded last night at the Hollywood Bowl. The first Prairie Home Companion was in 1974, and all of us who share this sliver on the radio spectrum know we wouldn\u2019t be in business if Garrison Keillor hadn\u2019t made a new thing called public radio truly sing.",
        "If you Google \u201dRio Olympics\u201d right now, you won\u2019t see much about the athletes. Instead, you\u2019ll see links to news stories that use the words \u201dhorror,\u201d \u201dwoes,\u201d \u201dcatastrophe,\u201d \u201dpollution\u201d and \u201dperfect storm.\u201d The latest news hasn\u2019t made things any better. On Thursday, mutilated human body parts were discovered on the beach near an Olympic sport venue. And today, armed robbers stole Olympic transmission equipment from German TV crews along the main highway in Rio. How bad are things, really? Bad.",
        "Michael Phelps knows he\u2019ll be going to his fifth Olympic Games next month. Phelps officially qualified for Rio on Wednesday, by winning the butterfly, a race he described as the hardest swim of his career. He followed that up with a win in the individual medley late Friday at the U. S. swimming trials in Omaha, and also qualified for the finals for the fly on Saturday. Wednesday\u2019s win in particular had meaning far beyond the pool \u2014 a symbolic victory over the personal problems he wrestled while becoming the most decorated Olympian in history.",
        "So what\u2019s up with the crayons? Everywhere you go lately \u2014 the bookstore, Starbucks \u2014 even here at NPR \u2014 I see grown men and women sitting around coloring. Every time, this takes me back to rainy childhood days on the living room floor: A robot. A mosaic of geometric houses. A flowery design pattern. Clearly, I\u2019ve stumbled upon the national craze for adult coloring books. My first question was: Really? Yup. There are thousands of titles now for every adult coloring book you could imagine, and then some.",
        "Fan fiction used to be reserved for themost diehard devotees of fantasy novels and boy bands \u2014 but it\u2019s made its way into this election. Fictional stories written about characters or real people can be found at almost every corner of the internet \u2014 subjects range from television shows like Game of Thrones, book series like Harry Potter, and celebrities like Beyonce and .

        "The machines look like a terminal at your local convenience store, but police agencies in a number of states are using them to read money cards seized from crime suspects. Officers can instantly freeze or seize the funds loaded on prepaid cards using the device, and some civil liberties advocates say the machines may be abused. But law enforcement officials and the device\u2019s developer say it\u2019s helping agencies crack down on fake cards and fraud.",
        "The Head And The Heart recently stopped by KCRW to preview songs from its forthcoming album, Signs Of Light. The   collective has never sounded better. Its members worked on the song \u201dAll We Ever Knew\u201d for years, and finally finished it in Nashville with the help of producer Jay Joyce. It\u2019s a great indication of what\u2019s to come from the new album, due out in September.",
        "The Purge series is all concept, no execution. (Forgive the criminally tasteless pun some brains never stop Purging.) The three films (The Purge (2013) The Purge: Anarchy (2014) and now The Purge: Election Year) come with a hook that\u2019s just the right amount of idiotic: a future U. S. government sanctions one annual night of crime with no repercussions, then waits for its citizens to kill each other. John Carpenter would have had a lot of fun with this.",
        "In an age when imagery can make anything possible, effects are expensive and miracles are cheap. So it should be said, as emphatically as possible, that the \u201dbig friendly giant\u201d in The BFG, Steven Spielberg\u2019s ingratiating adaptation of Roald Dahl\u2019s children\u2019s book, is a spectacular creation. Voiced by Mark Rylance, who won an Oscar last year for Spielberg\u2019s Bridge of Spies, the BFG interacts seamlessly with its counterparts and projects a warmth and tremulous humanity that keeps it out of the uncanny valley."
