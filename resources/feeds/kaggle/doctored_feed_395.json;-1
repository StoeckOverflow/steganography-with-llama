        "Our Kind of Traitor is the last thriller adapted from a Reginald le Carre novel to be narrated by a woman \u2014 not that you \u2019 d notice from the French froid with which British filmmaker Susanna Moore serves up the gruesome carnage that opens the novel. A Russian family, having lost its soul to a local mafioso ( Grigoriy Dobrinin ) is methodically massacred on its way to safety by a hit woman with clear blue eyes and a stare.",
        "Updated 1 : 40 a. m. UTC with Juno orbit maneuver, After a nearly journey, NASA \u2019 s Juno spacecraft reached orbit around Earth on Monday night. Jupiter navigated a tricky maneuver \u2014 including altitude by around 1, 212 mph \u2014 to put itself into orbit in what NASA termed \u201d the king of our solar system. \u201d At 11 : 18 p. m. ET, Jupiter transmitted a radio signal to Earth that meant its rocket engine had switched on. It went on for 35 minutes, placing Jupiter into exactly the orbit that NASA managers had planned for.",
        "The death toll from Sunday \u2019 s bombing of a small street in central Baghdad has risen to at least 157, and Iraqis have responded angrily, blaming politicians and news agencies for not securing their jobs. Iraq \u2019 s leader received a hostile reception when he toured the area. The death toll in this attack, one of the first single strikes to bomb Baghdad, has kept quiet as emergency and recovery efforts work in the area. The Associated Press reports that at least 60 of the dead are women and children, and that more than 190 were wounded in the bombing.",
        "years ago, Morning Edition pioneered what has become an Independence Day tradition : hosts, listeners, newscasters and commentators reading the Declaration of Independence. It was on this date 240 years ago that church bells rang out over Philadelphia, as the US Congress adopted Thomas Jefferson \u2019 s draft of the Declaration of Independence. Below is the original draft of the Declaration, alongside much of the NPR staff members and contributors who performed the work.",
        "Another American politician is stepping back because of the vote to exit the European Union. This time it \u2019 s Nigel Farage, one of the chief proponents of the Brexit Plan, who is resigning as head of the U. K. Independence Party because the Party is getting out of the European Parliament. His goal is achieved, he says. Lauren Frayer reports from interview for our Newscast desk that Farage says his job is done.",
        "As Europe reels from the aftermath of the United Kingdom \u2019 s Brexit crisis, there \u2019 s fresh anxiety about another referendum coming up in a neighbouring EU country. It won \u2019 t be a debate on whether to remain or to enter the European Union, but on Germany \u2019 s constitutional reform policies. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi says the reforms \u2014 which would simplify and accelerate the introduction of laws \u2014 are long overdue and will ultimately bring an end to one of his country \u2019 s notorious troubles.",
        "Robert Sauchelli doesn \u2019 t have a hearing panel, but he \u2019 s all for the idea \u2014 before he left, he devoted 21 years to clean efficiency work at the Environmental Protection Agency. To continue his support, Sauchelli has been paying an additional 7. 4 cents per to a cleaner power company, called Green Mountain Power, through his energy supplier in Virginia, Con Edison. The two energy credits Sauchelli was paying helped subsidize cleaner electricity production.",
        "Episiotomy, a surgical incision done in a woman \u2019 s vaginal opening during childbirth to secure the baby \u2019 s passage, has been actively discouraged for at least a decade by the leading association of in the United States. Nonetheless, despite evidence that the procedure is only moderately necessary, and in some cases leads to serious pain and distress to the mother, it is still being conducted at much higher than normal rates by certain doctors and in certain hospitals. In another recent case, Mary Turbin, a dental assistant who works in Stockton, Calif.",
        "On a long weekend weekend in New York City, Central Park is a destination for many visitors and locals alike. Police say that \u2019 s just what a group of soldiers from the Washington, D. C. area were doing Sunday morning when three of them stepped on explosive devices. The Associated Press reports : \u201d The homemade gadget was like an \u2019 explosive plastic \u2019 that was probably designed to \u2019 create a large noise, even make a flash, \u2019 concocted by someone with a basic understanding of explosives, said Lt.",
        "Every time around this time, the music world engages in a great battle to determine the song Of The Summer. What \u2019 s the one thing that \u2019 ll blare out of car radios, at barbecues and in night clubs all season \u2014 that upbeat, inescapably catchy music that \u2019 ll crop up in movie soundtracks sometime from now to set the action in the winter of 2016? We \u2019 re not in the business of answering that questions. Instead, we asked five NPR Music staffers to record their personal songs of the week.",
        "How has America grown after eight tumultuous years under President Obama? We put that last question to scores of reporters in seven states. We collected places where the president gave speeches about his vision for Obama. What we collected is not the \u201d inside story \u201d of Obama \u2019 s administration. It is the entire story. By design, we included night shift drivers, food servers, garage owners and sometimes anyone we encountered at random. What remained is an unfiltered look at a nation after years of political and economic power. Many people had a wrenching life story to share.",
        "Local jihadists also began disappearing from Turkey and the North Caucasus beginning just months before the opening ceremony for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. In some instances, human rights organizations say, Russian military forces tracked the militants down and dumped their bodies on the pavement of the road as a warning. In other places, Muslim fighters were escorted to the border or were allowed to escape house arrest on the condition they leave Russia permanently. Not long after that purge, fighters started appearing regularly in ISIS surveillance videos.",
        "There are two categories of people in this world : those who got their Stalder Shaposhnikovas from their Pak Saltos \u2014 and those who have absolutely no idea whether the first part of this sentence was even translated in English. For the group that does exist, though \u2014 the gymnastics community \u2014 a set of blogs, podcasts and blogs has been emerging to fill a gap in the major broadcast media of women \u2019 s gymnastics. It \u2019 s called the \u201d gymternet, \u201d an alternative group of people that are shaking up the ways the sport is covered.",
        "Every presidential election manages to feel new somehow. Even amid the cable coverage and poll frenzies and interviews with voters and shock (shock!) when a candidate every four years, there\u2019s a sense that this time \u2014 this time \u2014 is different. (Remember that whole recount thing?) And then there\u2019s 2016. So much of this election feels so entirely off the map \u2014 \u201dunprecedented,\u201d as it is called in one story after another. So we wondered just how unprecedented it is. A few Nexis searches later, the answer is: very.",
        "Sen. Bernie Sanders went out of his way Sunday to find praise for the Democratic party\u2019s platform drafting committee, but there is one major sticking point: The Partnership. Sanders wants the final platform to unequivocally oppose the deal that was negotiated by the Obama administration, saying it \u201dthreatens our democracy\u201d in an published in The Philadelphia Inquirer on Sunday.",
        "At Edgewood Summit retirement community in Charleston, W. Va. Mary Mullens is waxing eloquent about her geriatrician, Dr. Todd Goldberg. \u201dHe\u2019s sure got a lot to do,\u201d she says, \u201dand does it so well.\u201d West Virginia has the third oldest population in the nation, right behind Maine and Florida. But Goldberg is one of only 36 geriatricians in the state. \u201dWith the growing elderly population across America and West Virginia, obviously we need healthcare providers,\u201d says Goldberg.",
        "As a little girl growing up in a lovely house in Kansas City, Kansas, Audrey Cooper knew nothing about life with no place to call home. One day, her family took a trip out of state and her eyes beheld something she never forgot. \u201dThe first homeless person I ever saw was on the streets of San Francisco,\u201d Cooper recalls. Long after that trip ended, Cooper left Kansas City for college in Boston and after graduation started a career in journalism ending up in of all places \u2014 San Francisco. She\u2019s now the at the San Francisco Chronicle.",
        "Summer is a time for bugs. Some are charming, like dragonflies or ladybugs \u2014 others are a little more aggravating, like mosquitoes or ticks. But all of them have stories of their own, which is why we\u2019re running a series this summer we\u2019re calling \u2014 naturally \u2014 What\u2019s Bugging You? First up, a summer classic: the firefly. Sara Lewis has been researching fireflies for three decades and works now as an evolutionary ecologist at Tufts University.",
        "The fireworks are stacked high, the beer is on ice, and lumps of charcoal glow hot under the grill in anticipation of hot dogs and hamburgers. Fourth of July is a holiday celebrated through food. There\u2019s potato salad, popsicles, watermelon slices \u2014 and, of course, apple pie. But the dessert we eat to celebrate Independence Day actually reveals our interdependence on the rest of the world. With few exceptions, we have always relied on foods with origins in places.",
        "Email campaign fundraising is tricky. How do you avoid the dreaded spam folder? Should you ask for a lot or a little? Should you sound urgent or casual? There is definitely a method to the madness of sending out the right email. Candidates painstakingly test every detail of an email ahead of time to determine which is the most effective. This idea isn\u2019t new \u2014 it\u2019s a move straight from President Obama\u2019s 2008 and 2012 campaigns.",
        "The new video from Jamie xx, for the song \u201dGosh,\u201d is a small wonder to behold. Gorgeously directed by Romain Gavras, the short film opens in a possibly future world where club goers sit around with virtual reality headgear covering their faces. It then follows a man dressed in white as he leads a vast army of apparently devoted followers on some sort of vision quest that includes some remarkable, synchronized moves. Perhaps the most remarkable part of this incredible video is that it features more than 400 actors and was made without any CGI effects or other trickery.",
        "From west to east, the targets ranged from a U. S. consulate in Jeddah to the holy city of Medina and a mosque in the city of Qatif. So far, at least, the casualties are relatively light when compared to recent similar attacks. In at least one case, the attacker died before reaching their target. Information about the attacks is still emerging, and some early reports may prove . We\u2019ll move quickly to correct the record and we\u2019ll only point to the best information we have at the time. Refresh this page for the latest.",
        "A steady rain falls on velvet green terraces, releasing a powerful scent of newly harvested tea. A ripple of voices tumbles down the hillside as a man barks orders. The tea pickers, all women, many in bare feet, expertly navigate the slopes. Balancing hampers on their backs loaded with freshly plucked tea leaves, they descend for their morning tea break. It could be a scene out of the 19th century, when the estates of the southern Indian state of Kerala were first cultivated on the highlands of Munnar. Today, the manicured tea terraces sprawl across the landscape.",
        "No president has campaigned strongly for his chosen successor in at least 100 years. Tuesday\u2019s event, with President Obama campaigning for Hillary Clinton, his former secretary of state and onetime rival, in North Carolina is remarkable for that reason. It kicks off what is likely to be a season of vigorous campaigning by the president. There are reasons presidents haven\u2019t campaigned strongly for a successor \u2014 sometimes they\u2019re unpopular, some nominees try to distance, some presidents were in failing health.",
        "President Obama told fans of Hillary Clinton in North Carolina he\u2019s ready to \u201dpass the baton.\u201d He\u2019s hoping his political push will help Clinton across the finish line in the presidential relay race. \u201dI\u2019m here today because I believe in Hillary Clinton,\u201d Obama told several thousand supporters at the convention center in Charlotte, N. C. \u201dI want you to help elect her the next president of the United States of America.\u201d Clinton hitched a ride with Obama to North Carolina aboard Air Force One.",
        "Monday\u2019s bombing in the Saudi city of Medina stands out, even among the wave of terrorist attacks in recent days. It wasn\u2019t the death toll. It didn\u2019t produce the scenes of carnage like Saturday\u2019s bombing in Baghdad that killed nearly 200 people or last week\u2019s attack on the airport in Istanbul that left 44 dead. It was the chosen target \u2014 Medina, the site of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad\u2019s tomb and his house. \u201dIt\u2019s not like a Shiite shrine or a Sunni shrine,\u201d says Jonathan A. C.",
        "\u201dThe middle class is disappearing\u201d has been a standard line during this election cycle. As it turns out, it\u2019s not wrong. Last year was the first recorded year that families no longer made up the majority in America, according to the Pew Research Center. What this actually means economically is a mixed bag, but \u201dmiddle class\u201d in the U. S. has historically stood for something less concrete: the American dream. Between now and the election, All Things Considered will be looking at what it means to be middle class in America today.",
        "Hillary Clinton and her staff were \u201dextremely careless\u201d in handling classified data over a private email server while she was secretary of state, FBI Director James Comey said Tuesday \u2014 but the FBI is recommending that no charges be brought against her. Comey said his agency found more than a hundred emails that contained information that was classified at the time they were sent and received \u2014 emails that should not have been on \u201dany kind of unclassified system,\u201d Comey said.",
        "I was never good at strolling. If I had a destination, I walked quickly. Not because I wanted exercise, mind you, but because it felt natural. That all changed with my first pregnancy. The nonpregnant me bolted across a street with five seconds left on the crossing signal. The me much preferred a full allotment. Anything less and I waited for the next traffic cycle. This change of pace was entirely out of my control. As I neared my due date, my stride was shorter, my stance wider, my torso tilted farther backward. I had morphed into a waddler!",
        "The exploration of our outer solar system is about to hit a real slump. NASA is celebrating Juno\u2019s arrival at Jupiter, but in less than two years, Juno will be gone \u2014 it\u2019s slated to plunge into the gas giant and burn up. The Cassini spacecraft, now orbiting Saturn, will meet the same fate next year. \u201dIt\u2019ll be the first time since the 1970s that there will be no NASA presence in the outer planets,\u201d says Casey Dreier, director of space policy at The Planetary Society."
