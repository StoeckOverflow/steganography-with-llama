        "For 12 years, Chester, Pa. had no supermarket. In an attempt to end this food monopoly, a local food retailer plunked down a nonprofit grocery store in the impoverished Delaware County courthouse in October 2013. Area discount bank Philabundance opened the second store, called Fare Shop, in the same footprint as a former supermarket at the intersection of Trainer and 9th streets. When it opened, the supermarket was touted as a philanthropic venture and a boon to Chester, a village of about 34, 000. A third of the population remains below the poverty level.",
        "It \u2019 s the Fourth of July... err, was ( # CPT ) and it has us over at Code Switch learning a lot about flags. More important, on this week \u2019 s episode of the show, we \u2019 ve been thinking about people of color and their relationship to the United States flag \u2014 a relationship that can be really complicated for a lot of reasons. Who is the American flag for? And what does it matter when people of color want to wave it \u2014 or not wave it?",
        "After seven weeks, the British have released the findings of inquiry into the Iraq war. NPR \u2019 s Lauren Frayer noted that the report, the result of an investigation led by retired civil servant John Chilcot, claimed that Britain rushed to Iraq before all peaceful means were taken. Lauren filed this statement for our Newscast unit : \u201d Protesters yelled, \u2019 Tony Blair war crimes! \u2019 outside Britain \u2019 s embassy.

        "Tuesday was a tight bag for Hillary Clinton. She escaped a recommendation of an attorney from the FBI, removing the initial storm cloud over her in this congressional campaign. But it did not come without significant pain for Hillary, because while FBI Director Jack Comey did not recommend a formal pardon to the Department of Justice, he turned up an indictment of her judgment.",
        "Over the last 10 decades, 1970s funk icon Betty Davis has enjoyed a renaissance of rediscovery. Her album has been lavishly reissued and anthologized, but for years the holy grail was a collection of songs she recorded for Columbia Records in the early \u2019 60s, several of which her Miles Davis, helped to produce. For many, no one could believe those songs \u2014 until now. The Columbia Collection captures an artist seeking to assert her own voice. Janet Mabry was already enjoying a budding music career when Miles Davis came into her life.",

Clumsily at times, but she \u2019 s learning fast. So maybe she \u2019 s impressing Tony Stark, who \u2019 s confirmed his status as the Marvel universe \u2019 s Campbell \u2019 s soup can. Readers first met her in the March issues of Invincible Iron Man.",
        "While a sense of inevitability typically surrounds the topic of adult drinking, adults can play an important role in controlling underage alcohol use. Many recent studies emphasize guidance for parents. One finds that parents who set limits in a warm and friendly environment reduced the amounts that their adolescent children would binge drink. The other study focuses on the potential of a program that educates families and children about alcohol dependence. The stakes are high.",
        "Seconds after a person shot a man called Philando Castile in Falcon Ridge, Minn. his girlfriend started the story live on Facebook. In the final, emotional video, played as she sits next to Castile, who is bleeding profusely from gunshot wounds, Diamond Reynolds calmly tells viewers that they have been run over by police for a broken taillight. She claims Castile told the officer that he had a licensed firearm and the police asked for Castile \u2019 s firearm \u2019 s license and registration. Then, Harris says, the officer shot Castile multiple times in the arm.",
        "President Clinton laid out stark guidelines on the systemic racial inequities of the criminal justice system late Thursday, shortly after calling in Poland for a NATO summit.

        "The year is finally over. So I took a moment over the long holiday weekend to triumphantly declare, \u201d Mission accomplished! \u201d in place next to each of my New Year \u2019 s resolutions. Just kidding. I didn \u2019 t even continue much past January 15 with my vows to rest four days a week and ditch all desserts from Monday through Thursday. And I am certainly not alone. Simply working to change certain circumstances that we know raise the potential for health problems isn \u2019 t enough to get most of us to sort through, says John Updegraff, a professor of psychology at Kent State University.",

        "As parents, it can be natural enough to conclude that when our kids act up or act out \u2014 at home, at school, away at the beach or park on family summer vacation \u2014 we should tell them to calm down and be sure they follow through. After all, isn\u2019t it our job to teach our kids to learn some ? But what about the kids who not only can\u2019t calm down, they have no idea what it means to calm down?",
        "Air Force One: Who pays? That\u2019s the question a lot of people were asking after Hillary Clinton hitched a ride to Charlotte, N. C. this week with President Obama for their first joint campaign appearance. While it\u2019s unusual for an incumbent president to campaign actively for his successor, the question itself is not new. It\u2019s been raised before whenever presidents travel for their own campaign or on behalf of House and Senate candidates and campaign committees.",

        "Donald Trump is expected to announce his running mate any day now, and speculation is swirling about whom he might pick. A vice presidential choice is a critical one for the Republican presumptive nominee. Not only has he never held elective office, but he still hasn\u2019t united his party around his controversial candidacy. More social media missteps this week and comments praising former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein unsettled GOP leaders even more. Trump has said he is likely to pick someone with political experience who can help him navigate Washington if he\u2019s elected. That moves former Rep.",
        "For more than four hours Thursday, FBI Director James Comey answered questions from the U. S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Comey appeared just two days after he announced that while Hillary Clinton was \u201dextremely careless\u201d in handling classified information while she was secretary of state, she should not face charges. As you might expect, Comey was grilled by Republicans on whether Clinton lied and whether he had made a political decision. Comey just kept making his case: The FBI could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Clinton acted with criminal intent.",
        "Is it rape when a person has sex with someone who says \u201dno\u201d? It wasn\u2019t in Germany until Thursday, when the parliament cast a rare unanimous vote closing what German Justice Minister Heiko Maas described as \u201dblatant loopholes\u201d in his country\u2019s sexual assault laws. Previously, before charges could be filed a victim had to show police and prosecutors that she or he tried to physically resist the attacker. If a victim said \u201dno,\u201d that alone was not enough. Maas called it a \u201dsecond, bitter humiliation for the victims\u201d when perpetrators weren\u2019t punished.",
        "The mediocre animated comedy The Secret Lives of Pets is based on an original idea by Chris Meledandri, the head of Illumination Entertainment, the studio responsible for the Despicable Me movies and their popular spinoff Minions. That idea? Toy Story but with house pets, which really tests the elasticity of the word \u201doriginal.\u201d For animal lovers, however, the hook (\u201dEver wonder what your pets do when you\u2019re not home? \u201d) is mainlined catnip, given the degree to which we already anthropomorphize our beloved kitties and pups (and hamsters and fish and falcons).",

This case, and the larger question of doping, is a hot topic of discussion at the U. S. Olympic Trials in track and field trials currently underway in Eugene, Ore.

        "Colombian writer Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez once said that One Hundred Years of Solitude was a Vallenato: a traditional music of Colombia\u2019s Caribbean coast.

The occasion is the Vallenato Festival, which has been held in the city that gives the music its name for almost half a century.",
        "What does it mean to be middle class in America? When All Things Considered\u2019s Ari Shapiro asked people in New York City\u2019s Times Square, the answers were all over the place. \u201dYou\u2019re struggling, like, paycheck to paycheck, and you\u2019re going, \u2019Oh shoot, I want to go into HM, but you know what, I\u2019ll do it next week when I get paid again,\u2019 \u201d said Erin Kennedy, a who runs a gym in the Bronx.

        "Invoking the expression \u201dto be born with a marraqueta under arm\u201d in Chile is to speak of a child that has their future assured. It\u2019s a little more common than a silver spoon in one\u2019s mouth, and far more democratic, as the marraqueta, pan batido or pan franc\u00e9s \u2014 as it\u2019s called outside of the capital city of Santiago, where I live \u2014 is a staple food eaten sometimes as many as three times a day.

        "Last summer, the day after 61 percent of Greek voters rejected austerity in a referendum, they celebrated by dancing in the streets. Their \u201dno\u201d vote was seen as a war cry of independence from onerous technocrats in Brussels, whose policies, voters believed, were keeping Greece in perpetual recession and debt. But Despina Biri, a Greek researcher specializing in health and science, was full of trepidation. She opposed the tax hikes and job and wage cuts imposed by European Union creditors in exchange for bailout loans.",
        "Scientists have created a synthetic stingray that\u2019s propelled by living muscle cells and controlled by light, a team reports Thursday in the journal Science. And it should be possible to build an artificial heart using some of the same techniques, the researchers say. \u201dI want to build an artificial heart, but you\u2019re not going to go from zero to a whole heart overnight,\u201d says Kit Parker, a bioengineer and physicist at Harvard University\u2019s Wyss Institute. \u201dThis is a training exercise.\u201d Previous artificial hearts have been versions of mechanical pumps.",
        "When we think about the good life, art and food rank pretty high in importance. (OK, we at The Salt might be a little biased.) So it seems only natural that the two mix. Foods crop up in all kinds of art \u2014 from ancient Egyptian tomb walls to European still life paintings. But in art, an apple isn\u2019t always just an apple. Many foods carry specific meanings for different global artistic traditions, and those meanings can change over time. How well do you understand the secret language of foods in art? Take this quiz to find out.",
        "Tough love, interventions and programs are some of the most common methods of treating drug addiction, but journalist Maia Szalavitz says they\u2019re often counterproductive. \u201dWe have this idea that if we are just cruel enough and mean enough and tough enough to people with addiction, that they will suddenly wake up and stop, and that is not the case,\u201d she tells Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross. Szalavitz is the author of Unbroken Brain, a book that challenges traditional notions of addiction and treatment.",
        "There are two Venezuelas. In one, there are food riots and empty supermarket shelves and long lines of people waiting for basic goods. In the other, there are gourmet meals, creamy cappuccinos and rich desserts. At the Santa Elena supermarket in the poor neighborhood or barrio of Antimano in Caracas, the capital, Nerys Ojeda is looking for detergent to wash her clothes. There isn\u2019t any. \u201dWe can\u2019t find flour, spaghetti, sugar, butter. You can\u2019t find any of the things we really need,\u201d she says."
