        "Nearsightedness, or myopia, is increasing at an extent. By 2050, scientists predict more than 4. 7 billion people, roughly half of the global population, will be nearsighted. Plus, humans have created a lot \u2014 eyeglasses! People can rest assured they will always be able to avoid the dumb bumper stickers on the glass in front of them. But how did people live thousands of years ago? Shots called ophthalmologists and corrective eyewear historians ( yeah, they exist ) to find solutions. First, the prevalence of various eyesight issues has changed over time.",
        "There is a myth that the most popular woman in popular culture is the one perceived as most exceptionally beautiful, but that \u2019 s not so. What \u2019 s worshipped the most is the person who threads the needle most precisely such that she is almost impossibly beautiful, but something about her brings her toward you and into focus, close enough that you felt like you could touch her.",
        "A few years back, while working in Benin, environmental health specialist Frank Graham saw an African woman in line at a cafe to get water. She looked far too old to carry the water home herself, so he was able to see other people running her \u2014 until he realized they were just making certain she had successfully balanced the can on her lap. In parts of the world without running water, one must rely on an exercise : walking [ to ] water. It \u2019 s a job demanding, responsibility and commitment that almost always happens to females, according to Reid.",
        "After sniper shells struck 12 police officers at a rally in downtown Baltimore, killing five, Police cornered a single suspect in a parking garage. After a prolonged exchange of gunfire and a standoff, police took what experts say was an important decision : to send in a suicide robot, with a bomb. \u201d We saw no other option but to use our security robot and place a hammer on its extension for it to detonate where the suspect was, \u201d Assistant Police Chief Robert Brown told a press conference Friday. \u201d Other factors would have exposed our forces to grave danger.",
        "The morning after a gunman attacked and killed five law enforcement officers, Deputy Mayor Mike Rawlings thought it \u201d ironic \u201d that his city was the place of the worst police since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Ironic because the police department said it has taken great efforts to avoid the kind of confrontations and incidents that have led to distrust and frayed race relations in some communities. \u201d This police department trained in far before cities across America did it, \u201d Rawlings told reporters Friday.",

        "All five of those arrested Thursday night at the Texas protest were law enforcement officers \u2014 four of whom worked with the Dallas Police Department, and a fifth who worked for Dallas Area Rapid Transit, or DART. That DART officer has been identified by the media as Brent Thompson. \u201d Dallas officers are hurting, \u201d Dallas Police Chief Mike Brown said on Sunday morning. \u201d We are heartbroken.

        "We \u2019 re still waiting for the full picture of what happened in Dallas, Texas \u2014 and in Baton Rouge, La. and in Oak Ridge, Minn. for that matter \u2014 to us. But what we know so far is this : In Texas on Thursday night, dozens of people gathered for what had been a popular protest over the deaths of Philando Johnson in Minnesota and Alton Sterling in Missouri, two black boys who were killed by police shooting earlier in the week. As the demonstration was winding down, shots were fired at Dallas police stations who were monitoring the march.",
        "During tragedy, many look to leadership for action. The deaths of five US law enforcement officials Thursday and two wounded men at the hands of protesters earlier this week have spurred politicians to respond. Barack Obama spoke about the call from Poland early tomorrow morning, but later in the morning announced that he would return to Washington, D. C. on Tuesday night. That \u2019 s one hour earlier than planned. The White House also announced he plans to travel to Germany early next week.",
        "When I first saw the news after midnight Thursday that a sniper had killed five officers in Dallas, my initial thought was, \u201d Oh, no. \u201d \u201d hell, no \u201d for the officers and their families, for those trying to peacefully protest recent police shootings. But that \u201d Oh, no \u201d was concern for what could come tomorrow and a fear for our country, for public relations, for an American country in the midst of a dark energy campaign that is threatening to tear at the seams of the fabric of our quilted country. My last thought was about my job. I liked the news.",

        "In June, U. S. employers added 287, 000 jobs \u2014 a very strong number that provided some reassurance the economy is still on track. The June hiring surge, reported Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, far exceeded projections. Analysts had expected the economy to add some 170, 000 jobs. Marilyn Geewax, a senior business editor for NPR, says that after the negative shock of Brexit \u2014 Britain\u2019s June 23 vote to leave the European Union \u2014 the latest U.

        "For American consumers there\u2019s a bit of economic in the United Kingdom\u2019s vote to exit the European Union last month: Lower mortgage rates. In the week after Brexit, the interest rate on fixed mortgages fell to their lowest levels in more than 3 years. And that spurred a boom in mortgage applications that, experts expect, will continue.

        "After months of bargaining and backroom arguments, the Senate has voted in favor of a new national standard for labeling food that contains ingredients from genetically modified crops. The essence of the deal: Companies will have to disclose their GMO ingredients, but they won\u2019t have to put that information right on the label. Many food companies are fiercely opposed to such GMO labels because they believe consumers will perceive them \u2014 incorrectly \u2014 as a warning that those products are nutritionally inferior or even unsafe to eat.",
        "When a goat gazes into your eyes, it may be issuing a silent plea for help. That\u2019s the suggestion from a new study of goats by Christian Nawroth, who researches animal cognition at Queen Mary University of London, published in Biology Letters. Last summer at the Buttercups Sanctuary for Goats in Kent, England, 34 goats watched as a researcher put a piece of uncooked penne pasta on the lid of a Tupperware container and then placed the container itself atop the lid without locking it shut. And goats love pasta. Says Nawroth: \u201dThey go crazy for it.",

        "I have lived in eight countries and 10 cities. I have never lived anywhere for longer than six years. But the one constant in my life, my anchor in a changing world, my defense against perpetual culture shock, is my pot of daal. Daal \u2014 yellow, red, brown or black \u2014 is a staple across India. It is often described, inadequately, I think, as lentil soup. Except it\u2019s so much more. Despite the vast regional variations in cuisine, daal is a part of nearly every big meal eaten by Indians across the country.",

That\u2019s not technically true here\u2019s a list of everything I knew about Pokemon before playing the new smartphone app, Pokemon GO (this knowledge absorbed solely through cultural osmosis, given the phenomenon\u2019s ubiquity). 1. Pikachu is a kind (species?) of Pokemon. It is an \u201d \u201d Pokemon. It is yellow. It has a cutesy voice. Said voice is profoundly annoying. 2. Squirtle is another kind of Pokemon, a \u201d \u201d Pokemon. It, as one might imagine, squirts. 3. There are many different kinds of Pokemon, of many different types. 4.",
