        "It \u2019 s hard to work out what to say after the horrific chaos of recent days, but Shereen Marisol Meraji and Jennifer Demby are our guides as they walk us through this week \u2019 s extra challenges. The week began with the footage \u2014 captured on videos that showed viral \u2014 of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, La. and Philando Castile in Falcon Ridge, Minn. at the urging of police officers.",
        "I think I remembered the moment Philando Castile disappeared this week. It was on the video his father made after he was shot by a police officer. He was still screaming when the video began. His wife talking into the camera while smoke seeped across his chest. Her mom in the back seat, attempting to reassure her mother everything would be alright. The police officer still at the side of the car, a gun in his hand. And then Castile died. And his daughter \u2019 s calm voice never changed as she realized what had occurred. I saw it...",
        "Journalist Gay Talese has never shied away from controversial politics. He took on the mafia in Honor Thy Heart and dove deep into women \u2019 s sex life in Thy Neighbor \u2019 s House. But even Talese paused when he first heard about the Manor Hill Motel in Aurora Colo. back in 1980. Innkeeper Jim Foos had outfitted his motel with a special suit which allowed him to spy on his wife \u2014 and he invited Talese to take a trip as well. Talese, a man of seemigly insatiable passion, did just that.",
        "The killing of Alton Johnson, 37, by police earlier this week touched off protests across the country \u2014 but in Sterling \u2019 s rival city of Baton Rouge, La. demonstrators \u2019 outrage has already exceeded a parboil. And that \u2019 s by design. This year, civil rights organization gathered on the steps of City Hall, and called Baton Rouge a \u201d model city \u201d for dealing with such tragedies \u2014 drawing a response to the sometimes violent protests that overtook Ferguson, Mo. after a police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, and Detroit, Md. after Freddie Grey died in police custody.",
        "When the Labor Ministry released its monthly business report Friday, it indicated a hiring surge in June, with 287, 000 new jobs taken up. And the report suggested something else : we \u2019 re spending more to have employment. Dig down into June \u2019 s numbers and you \u2019 ll discover the hiring boom was triggered by consumers spending money on good times. For example, in the \u201d food services and retail places \u201d category, employers hired another 22, 000 jobs. But it didn \u2019 t end there check out the \u201d fun \u201d places where employers cut jobs : Maybe you \u2019 re right : well, it was June.",
        "I have some reservations about the program Life, Animated, but they can \u2019 t undermine how closely I was watching its subject, help Suskind, who has autism, figure out how to see the world using old cartoons as a reference material. Here \u2019 s the scenario laid out by the movie, which is directed by Roger Dean Williams from a book by filmmaker Ron Suskind. When Owen, Suskind and his wife Cornelia \u2019 s second son, was adopted, he seemed \u201d normal \u201d until week 3, when, as Suskind puts it, he \u201d vanished. \u201d His communication skills deteriorated. He lost what language he \u2019 d attained. Autism was back.",
        "She \u2019 s only eight years old, but knows a little about her homeland. It is, she says, \u201d the height of the rising sun \u201d and \u201d the most beautiful country. \u201d Of course, North Korea is the only place has ever seen, and the only place she \u2019 s really likely to see.

        "This is a tale of two former bodybuilders, facing off in litigation \u2014 over a patent. And not just any patent : based on federally funded companies, this one has a pedigree that links back to one of the most prestigious universities in the world. And this kind of legal mano a mano raises questions about the position of universities in the patent world. There \u2019 s a patent for that?",
        "One of dance music \u2019 s many true attractions is the standing challenge of leaving behind the audience \u2019 s darkest tendencies and squabbles for a few hours. Yet the primary reason such an art is consistently valid, and more entertaining than escapism, is that beneath what seem to be a simplistic, veneer, dance music reflects the atmosphere that it is created in. In fact, at its simplest, dance music transcends it, creating a possible model for contemporary society \u2019 s moving image.",
        "For Adnan Hussain Nanjee of Punjab, Pakistan, postage stamps are more than just postage stamps : They tell the history of his homeland. \u201d Take a look for yourself, \u201d said Nanjee, who was in New York last month to take part in the World Stamp Show, a international convention that welcomed around 250, 000 stamp collectors and designers, eager to display, purchase, buy and sell every philatelic. He takes out his phone and takes a slideshow of brightly colored pages, decorated with scenic backdrops and simple geometric patterns.",

        "Credit : When a jailer finally slumped forward and lying motionless, a group of four inmates burst out of a holding cell. Still shackled, the inmates were able to make enough noise to summon support for the guard in distress. \u201d A jailer might very well be alive tonight thanks to the inmates he was visiting at the Parker County Administration building, \u201d reported. The struggle involving at least five inmates was captured on YouTube video. You can see the ailing prisoner slumped in the corner of the cell.",
        "I step up to the counter at Willy\u2019s Cafe at Willamette High School in Eugene, Ore. and order a latte. There\u2019s a powerful scent of fresh coffee in the air, and a group of juniors and seniors hover over a large espresso machine. Carrie Gilbert, 17, shows how it\u2019s done: \u201dYou\u2019re going to want to steam the milk first,\u201d she explains. \u201dThen once you have the coffee, dump it in and use the rest of the milk to fill the cup.\u201d She hands over my order. Not bad. Yes, this is a class, and these students are earning credit.",
        "They call him \u201dThe Punisher.\u201d And \u201dDuterte Harry.\u201d And now, \u201dMr. President.\u201d Rodrigo Duterte was sworn in as the Philippines\u2019 president just over a week ago after running on a simple platform of ridding the country of crime and corruption. And since he took office, more than 60 alleged \u201ddrug suspects\u201d have been killed in encounters with police, according to police. Others have simply turned up dead with signs pinned to their shirts proclaiming their guilt.

        "#NPRreads is a weekly feature on Twitter and The . The premise is simple: Correspondents, editors and producers from our newsroom share the pieces that have kept them reading, using the#NPRreads hashtag. Each weekend, we highlight some of the best stories. I\u2019ll happily admit to a longtime HGTV addiction. But I have a much more complicated relationship with the shows that now fill those sort of channels. Doree Shafrir, writing for BuzzFeed News, puts together the best profile I\u2019ve seen yet on these shows and the \u201dtiny house movement\u201d they\u2019re part of.",
        "In 1962, Goonhilly Earth Station\u2019s biggest satellite dish, Arthur, received the first live television broadcast from America. Over the coming decades, it would bring Muhammad Ali\u2019s fights, the Apollo 11 moon landing and the U. S. leg of Live Aid to British TV screens. In the year 2000, as an on a school trip, I approached this monument to telecommunication in a state of anxious anticipation over less momentous news.

        "Even for an band coming to bloom in the 1990s, Garbage had a pretty unforgettable name. The music stood out as well: Singles like \u201dOnly Happy When It Rains,\u201d \u201dStupid Girl\u201d and \u201dPush It\u201d vaulted over the influence of grunge to make use of industrial and electronic elements, some sheen and singer Shirley Manson\u2019s unmistakable voice.

        "In the port town of Tanmen, on China\u2019s southernmost province of Hainan Island, I met Wang Zhenzhong. He\u2019s done pretty well for himself. He graduated from college in Beijing and he runs his own business, selling handicrafts related to the town\u2019s maritime culture. He likes to play the guitar.
