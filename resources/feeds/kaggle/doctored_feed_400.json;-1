        "Here \u2019 s a typical moment when you have a medical problem. You drive to your doctor \u2019 s office, then have to travel across town to a doctor for a blood test and then you really have to get an appointment for an or MRI. There \u2019 s a bad chance this will all require a phone call \u2014 or a lot of missed calls \u2014 with your insurance companies. It \u2019 s a hassle and it \u2019 s. But for many people it \u2019 s probably worse than that.",
        "It \u2019 s been an eventful weekend for Pok\u00e9mon trainers \u2014 even without Team Rocket team. After being released Wednesday, the online app Pok\u00e9mon Go is currently the top grossing free app, and the biggest grossing app, in both the iOS and Android stores. The virtual reality game enables smartphone users to track and track Pok\u00e9mon in real life, like a fantasy part of Google Maps. Developed by Niantic Labs, in collaboration with Nintendo and The Pok\u00e9mon Channel. Pok\u00e9mon Go became an immediate hit.",
        "In an epidemic, healthcare professionals often attempt to answer two key questions : Who is sick and where are they? There are several digital strategies to accurately answer these questions. Scientists have investigated how a spike in telephone searches ( for example, \u201d What is disease? \u201d ) can help them determine if a disease is spreading and how many patients might be affected in a given area. Similar predictions can be gleaned from Wikipedia page results. But in developing countries, where infected people have limited Internet access, these predictors fall short. That \u2019 s where phones come in.",
        "How \u2019 s this for British people : The United Kingdom is about to see a new prime minister, Theresa May, who argues in favor of keeping the UK in the European Union. By agreeing to leave the EU in a March 23 referendum, U. N. voters turned the EU \u2019 s politics upside down and forced the immediate resignation of Prime Minister David Cameron, a strong backer of remaining in the parliamentary body. Now Cameron \u2019 s old Conservative Party has nominated a successor, May, the national secretary and a longtime Member of Parliament \u2014 who also recommended staying in the EU. What next?",
        "The way clouds cover the Earth would be changing because of global warming, according to a study published Monday that used weather data to track warming patterns across about three decades, starting in the 1980s. Clouds in the sky toward the poles during that decade, as the subtropical dry season expanded and the highest winds higher. These changes are seen by most climate models of global warming, even though those models disagree on a variety of other things related to climate, says Joel Brown, a climate scientist at the University of California, San Diego.",
        "As fighting continued in South Sudan, tens of thousands of civilians have sought refuge inside a U. N. base, The Associated Press reports. At least two U. N. peacekeepers have been killed, the AP rebels, and aid workers are having difficulties supplying water to the nearly 30, 000 people inside the base. Both sides have now announced a Reuters release. President Salva Kiir announced a unilateral apology \u2014 though his words were disrupted by heavy gunfire, the president writes. Vice president Riek Machar followed up by declaring a plan soon be in place on his orders.",
        "2016 has been an unexpectedly gloomy period for musical genius. I \u2019 ve said before that the deaths of David Bowie, Maurice White, Queen, Bernie Worrell and a host of other early musical icons mean that the high level of artistic excellence inaugurated in the early 1960s and \u2019 70s by musicians like The Police and Jimi Hendrix may be on the wane. But even if mavericks are leaving us harder than we \u2019 d like, you can \u2019 t easily overlook the death of a new generation of musicians with commanding technical chops like Robert Glasper and Esperanza Spalding.",
        "To judge from our newspaper coverage, you \u2019 d think that Italy isn \u2019 t so much a country as a nation. But if you look beyond the urban talk of drug use and The Wall, you discover that Argentina has a booming culture. In recent years, there \u2019 s been an explosion of literary work \u2014 from the sly provocateur Mario Bellatin to the brainy and ambitious Valeria Luiselli. This writing makes most popular literary fiction seem pale and cannily packaged. Much of this work is now appearing in English thanks to today \u2019 s independent small presses.",
        "Most everyone needs someone adversely affected by financial debt : More than 40 million families are shouldering a crippling $ 1. 3 trillion in loans. That debt is obstructing careers, families, families, employment and even education. Uncle Sam and Wall Street have made millions of money off the crisis. We \u2019 ve covered this issue in many places, including the debates, the meetings, tips for easing debt, how debt is affecting young men \u2019 s decision making and a little more. But how did we get here? Who has profited most and how?",
        "Student loans have become an issue in the election campaign, especially on the business side. And it \u2019 s no wonder. There are more than 40 billion Americans with some $ 1. 3 trillion in federal student loan fund. But people who study behavioral finance say one widely popular way to help lessen the debt rate may not be as good as it looks.",
        "The past few weeks may mark the time at which the interests of Fox Television and its charismatic chairman, Roger Ailes, diverge from those of its parent company, 21st Century Fox, and the Murdoch family that controls it. The Murdochs have arranged for an outside lawyer to investigate the claims that Ailes experienced sexual harassment by selling sexual favors in exchange for furthering the career of former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.",
        "The food department is, for me, hugely disappointing. Before owning restaurants, I used to see them getting all shiny and powerful in the convenience store, and I \u2019 d fantasize about never chopping a stick by hand again. I failed to mention that cookbook authors have particular notions about how each ingredient should be prepped. The food processor, no matter how many spices it may come with, usually doesn \u2019 t cut it. Take this one for lettuce wraps with sauce. It \u2019 s one of my meals.",
        "So many complaints about this election are unprecedented \u2014 and one of the most obvious is how much voters dislike the candidates. By now, everyone knows that this year contains the two most unpopular presumptive elections on record. But in some ways, Americans \u2019 dislike of the presidential candidates isn \u2019 t so remarkable. In fact, a recent report from the Pew Research Center shows that 1992 voters were just as conservative in their candidate choices, perhaps even more so, than voters are today.",
        "A majority of Americans say they\u2019re stressed at work. And it\u2019s clear the burden of stress has negative effects on health, including an increase in heart disease, liver disease and gastrointestinal problems. Still, though it\u2019s been known for years that periodically disengaging from one\u2019s everyday routine can reduce stress, most Americans don\u2019t take advantage of their days off. A recent poll conducted by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T. H.",
        "President Obama and former President George W. Bush spoke at an interfaith memorial service Tuesday afternoon for the five police officers murdered in Dallas last week. Bush, a resident of Dallas, noted that he interacts with law enforcement every day. \u201dWe\u2019re proud of the men we mourn,\u201d he said. Bush called the shooting last Thursday evil and said the shock of the attack had not yet faded. He also appealed for unity. \u201dAt times, it seems like the forces pulling us apart are stronger than the forces binding us together. Argument turns too easily into animosity.",
        "Following the deadliest attack on law enforcement since Sept. 11, President Obama and former President George W. Bush attended an interfaith memorial on Tuesday to honor the five law enforcement officers killed during a peaceful protest in Dallas. \u201dFaced with this violence we wonder if the divides of race in America can ever been bridged,\u201d Obama said. \u201dDallas, I\u2019m here to say we must reject such despair. I\u2019m here to insist we\u2019re not as divided as we seem. I know how far we\u2019ve come against impossible odds,\u201d he added.",
        "What does it mean to be middle class in America? Nearly a century ago, in Detroit \u2014 which was then the burning core of the country\u2019s middle class \u2014 the answer might have looked like a hot dog: a Detroit Coney, to be precise. At its most basic, a Detroit Coney is a kind of chili dog \u2014 \u201da steamed bun, with a hot dog, beef and pork,\u201d explains Joe Grimm, author of the book Coney Detroit.",
        "On Sunday, aid worker Jeremiah Young couldn\u2019t tell if he was hearing thunderclaps or bombs. That\u2019s the scene in Juba, capital of South Sudan. Rainy season has begun. And intense fighting broke out on Thursday \u2014 a new round of fighting between supporters of the vice president and troops backing the president. Heavy gunfire was exchanged, along with mortar and grenade explosions. As the conflict erupted, an estimated 30, 000 people fled their homes, seeking safer ground.",
        "Tuesday was the big moment that Hillary Clinton has been waiting for: Bernie Sanders, who gave her a hard, unexpected fight for the Democratic nomination, endorsed her. Their appearance together in New Hampshire was a show of party unity, but voter unity may be harder to achieve \u2014 especially among young voters. A new poll from The Associated Press and University of Chicago suggests Clinton has yet to convince this group, perhaps Sanders\u2019 most reliable demographic this campaign season. Her weakness extends across racial and ethnic groups.",
        "A quick consultation with Dr. Google will tell you that drinking lots of water \u2014 and staying \u2014 can help you lose weight. But is there any truth to this? A new study published in the Annals of Family Medicine adds to the evidence that hydration may play a role in weight management. \u201dWhat we found was that people who were inadequately hydrated had increased odds of being obese,\u201d says study author Tammy Chang of the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Michigan.",
        "The U. S. State Department\u2019s Heroes came from very different corners of the world: Cyprus, Pakistan, Russia and Senegal. Yet all carried the same thing in their pocket or purse: photos of the victims they had rescued from human trafficking, stored in their mobile phones. Syeda Fatima, a human rights activist from Pakistan, pulled up an image on her phone of a man who had been beaten on the left side of his head. Working with various groups, she has freed laborers forced to work at brick kilns and carpet factories, then offered them legal aid, protection and shelter.",
        "On July 15, 1984, President Ronald Reagan signed a proclamation declaring July National Ice Cream Month, and called \u201dupon the people of the United States to observe these events with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\u201d As this week marks that momentous occasion\u2019s 32nd anniversary, hosts Bob Boilen and Robin Hilton see it as their civic duty to do an entire show about ice cream. To make this week\u2019s playlist, we asked you to tell us about your favorite songs and memories of ice cream.",
        "In 2015, after winning an Emmy for her work on Inside Amy Schumer, comedy writer Jessi Klein made one important stop before heading to the award show \u2014 to pump breast milk in a backstage dressing room. Klein\u2019s son was 3 months old at the time, and she says that while winning the Emmy was \u201dgenuinely awesome and exciting,\u201d she also knew it wasn\u2019t going to change her life. Klein recalls the scene to Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross: \u201dI\u2019m sitting there with the Emmy statuette at my feet and I\u2019m wearing kind of a fancy dress.",
        "Obamacare health plans have been getting a bad rap this year. Critics say the premiums are too high, the costs are out of control, and the requirements and red tape are too thick. But now the Obama administration is pushing back. A study released Tuesday by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services argues that the isn\u2019t nearly as heavy as previous analyses have shown, because most consumers get subsidies that limit their deductibles and copayments.",
        "When the health insurance premiums got to the point that they were higher than her mortgage, Renee Powell started to become cynical. \u201dThere was something in me that just kind of switched,\u201d said the mother of two from Bartlesville, Okla. \u201dI was OK with paying $750, but when it became about $100 more than my housing costs, it upset me.\u201d Powell is an epidemiologist and used to work for the state in Oklahoma City. She had affordable insurance through that job.",
        "Imagine you\u2019ve been hungry for the past four years. When the bombing isn\u2019t too bad, you can grow a little spinach and beans, and sometimes some smuggled lentils or rice get past the Syrian army checkpoints. But there\u2019s no milk for babies and your children have never seen a piece of fruit. This kind of siege warfare sounds medieval, but in Syria, it is reality for hundreds of thousands of people. Most live in opposition areas, surrounded by Syrian government forces. And one of the most desperate places is Daraya, just to the southwest of the capital Damascus.",
        "An international tribunal in The Hague has invalidated China\u2019s claims in the South China Sea in a ruling. The decision has been rejected by Beijing. The disputed waters are claimed by China, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and other countries. But China has been the most aggressive in staking out its claim \u2014 marking a \u201d line\u201d around the bulk of the islands and waters, and building up artificial islands within the disputed region. The Philippines brought a case against China to international courts.",
        "Editor\u2019s Note: This story was originally published on April 13 and has been updated to include the latest developments. China and six other countries have competing and overlapping claims to islands, fishing rights and other resources in the South China Sea. The United States is also deeply involved. It has long been the leading naval power in Asia and has alliances with several countries at odds with China. The Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague ruled on Tuesday that China\u2019s extensive claims to the South China Sea were invalid, but Beijing immediately rejected the ruling.",
        "The South China Sea fills Ma Sijin with national pride. The retired ink factory worker says he is glad to see China challenging foreign powers, including the United States, over control of the strategic waterway. \u201dAll the Chinese people have now stood up!\u201d says Ma, 66, quoting the famous words of Chairman Mao Zedong when he announced the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949. \u201dWhen all is said and done, everybody knows who these islands belong to,\u201d Ma continues, polishing off a dinner of meatballs, rice and greens in Shanghai.",
        "There\u2019s a reason Jose Luis Vilson\u2019s students learn in groups: He wants them to feel comfortable working with anyone in the classroom, something he\u2019s realized in his 11 years of teaching doesn\u2019t always come naturally. \u201dI don\u2019t really give students a chance to until later on, when I feel like they can pretty much group with anybody,\u201d he says. Vilson teaches math at a public middle school just north of Harlem in New York City."
