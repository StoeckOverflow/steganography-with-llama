And nobody was susceptible. \u201d So you get this really raging epidemic that travels through the population, usually very small and infects a pretty high portion of the population, \u201d says James Lessler, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. That \u2019 s exactly what happened. Millions of cities across South and Central America have been infected with Zika.",

And if you \u2019 re travelling overseas, you may try to check to see if the State Department has issued a safety alert or warning for your stay. Hardly a week goes by that some alert isn \u2019 t issued, about everything from natural disasters to terrorist events.

        "This piece was followed by NPR \u2019 s summer morning series, Read, Read, Binge! Over the next two decades, Republicans and Democrats will vote in Cleveland and Philadelphia for a day that has become almost purely ceremonial : Each party will \u201d separate \u201d presidential candidates. Of course, it \u2019 s all for show. There hasn \u2019 t been a second round of voting ( a second one ) at a major party state convention since 1952.

        "Even if you are a mature person with adult readers, you are likely aware that a third incarnation of Ghostbusters arrives in theaters this week. It stars six funny women and was by a mistake, and at least some proportion of its potential audience has found these staffing issues alarming. While I haven \u2019 t seen it yet, Ghostbusters \u2019 16 is by most standards neither a feminist war cry nor a cynically made parody, but a light midsummer amusement. \u201d Too \u201d reviewed the Village Voice \u2019 s Kevin Anderson.",

        "A lot has been written about the difficulty Donald Trump has had getting the Republican ticket behind him. But one thing has always backed him in the House : Republican Jeff Sessions of Alabama. They \u2019 re the odd pairing of politics : a New York City tycoon and a guy from the Deep South. One one is. The other, famous for bold exaggerations. But Obama and Sessions are linked by their shared view on one major issue : immigration. And Davis too has had a controversial political career. Leading Senate Republicans accused Sessions years ago of being insensitive on issues of immigration.",
        "Getting to next week\u2019s Republican National Convention in Cleveland has become more of a burden than some delegates were expecting. For one thing, some of them had no idea they\u2019d be on the hook for the whole cost of casting a vote for their candidate. One such delegate is Rita Gaus, who lives out among the cornfields and wind turbines about two hours south of Chicago in Buckingham, Ill.
