        "When you listen to the message, the message is clear : They believe police are too quick to squeeze the trigger when faced with imminent danger. The reality is that it \u2019 s very hard to tell whether this is anything that \u2019 s changing : The statistics on police use of force in the U. S. are too unreliable to say much for certain. Still, Steve Kraska is among those who do think cops have become quicker to use force.",
        "Donald Trump could stand to differ from his reported vice presidential pick Mike Pence in a lot of ways, in particular from his perceived Christian identity, which would help Trump generate needed support in local communities. But Pence initially backed Ted Cruz, albeit without enthusiasm, and there were some hints that the Indiana governor favored Trump. Less than a year after Cruz dropped out, Pence succeeded Trump. The initial pressure from Pence might be the result of arguments between the two men.",
        "One morning in 2012, a group of policemen in a coastal town were sitting together in the office when an unusual caller came in. This town, unlike Aarhus, is a clean, orderly area with very little crime. So what the callers were saying really held the officers \u2019 attention. They were parents, and they were \u201d just hysterical, \u201d unlike Thorleif Link, one of the officers. Their son was missing. They turned up one day and he was murdered.",
        "Walking to Chinatown in the Mission District of San Francisco, John Luna noticed a pattern. Just after the first and the 15th of the month, he says, he saw long lines of lines. \u201d It \u2019 s like trying to walk into the most popular nightclub in the country, \u201d says Luna. But what he noticed at the front of the line was not a restaurant or lounge. Instead, the longer lines led to account cashing outlets and payday lenders. Luna, who is a financial adviser, grew up in this typical Latino neighborhood, where many of the residents are unbanked.",
        "When Julian Castro assumed the post of Housing and Urban Development Minister in 2014, the U. S. government still had a few programs aimed at giving Americans \u2019 access to the system. It \u2019 s the sort of thing that is paramount to progress in the modern economy, long advocated by President Trump and other government officials. \u201d When I returned [ to the agency ], \u201d Castro said, sitting at a wide briefing table on a top floor of the HUD Building in Washington, \u201d I saw that for Americans in public housing, it wasn \u2019 t much....",
        "In the last 400 years or so, since the time of the world revolution, we have come to believe it natural to suppose that the world is comprehensible. Nature and its laws, found in things most small as well as in the cosmos as a whole, are understandable. And, yet, the first J. B. S.",
        "For much of the decade, and particularly in such cerebral styles as indie rock, country folk and Americana, artists have been more willing to command critical praise for cultivating their songwriting voices than for interpreting words from others \u2019 pens. But John Prine, who was once pegged as a great Dylan, seems to be having a harder time toying with that modern songwriting hierarchy.",
        "Welcome to the first installment of Read, Paper, Binge! our summer recommendation service. As you may recall from last month \u2019 s list, we were born of algorithms that only matched books to books or movies to film. So this month, we \u2019 ve enlisted the use of real live audiences to pair books with movies, musicals, TV, plays, podcasts and more. ( And to catch up on last month \u2019 s movie list, click here. ) The Best Of Youth ( movie ) because it \u2019 s an addictive and epic Italian movie about two brothers that crossed generations, weaving the social and the political together.",
        "Sometime approximately 12, 000 years ago, our people began trying their hands at farming. First, they planted wild varieties of crops like peas, lentils and barley and herded wild livestock like goats and grazing oxen. Centuries later, they switched to agriculture full time, farming both animals and plants, developing new varieties and foods. Eventually, they migrated southward, spreading farming to much of Europe and Asia. The ancient farmers lived in the Fertile Crescent, a region in the Middle East including Iraq, Palestine, Syria, Israel, Syria, southeastern Turkey and southern Iran.",
        "Think of it as easy to go \u2014 and on the go. That \u2019 s the title for the exhibition \u201d Designs for Mobile Tourism : Art from Eastern African \u201d at the Baltimore Museum of Art. There are a mere 28 objects, ranging from brightly decorated shoes and belts for carrying luggage to finely crafted necklaces and painstakingly made drinking vessels. But collectively and together the objects illustrate how nomadic cultures in the foothills of the Great Rift Valley, where Ethiopia borders Tanzania, imbue perhaps the most functional objects with traditional style and cultural values.",
        "Even though House Speaker John Ryan has endorsed President Trump, he has continued to have loads of criticism for his party \u2019 s presumptive candidates. In an interview with NPR \u2019 s David Inskeep on Thursday afternoon in his suite in the Capitol, Ryan was worried that Trump would hang around on free trade agreements and the controversial tactics he \u2019 s used on the campaign trail. Ryan has continued to expand his support for Trump by stating the presumptive Democratic nominee has to be blocked from winning the White House. At a CNN town house on Tuesday, Ryan said it \u201d a binary choice.",
        "House Speaker Paul Ryan knows what it\u2019s like to be thrown into running for vice president. Just four years ago, he was named Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate in the former Massachusetts governor\u2019s failed bid for the presidency. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump was set to name his running mate \u2014 who, a source tells NPR, will be Indiana Gov. Mike Pence \u2014 on Friday, but he postponed the announcement in the wake of Thursday evening\u2019s attacks in Nice, France.",
        "House Speaker Paul Ryan spoke with NPR\u2019s Steve Inskeep. Steve Inskeep: We\u2019re sitting down in the middle of a year in which a lot of people, particularly those involved in politics, have expressed distress, have said that they don\u2019t know their party anymore, don\u2019t know their country anymore. And so I\u2019d like to know: What if anything have you learned about the country from the presidential campaign and the events of this year that you didn\u2019t know? Paul Ryan: I\u2019ve learned the country is very distressed. I took this job Oct.",
        "So it\u2019s the week before the Republican National Convention and we don\u2019t know who the vice presidential running mate is going to be. Then the nominee schedules a Saturday midday event and walks onstage with a younger man from Indiana who is known for his ardent conservatism. Sound familiar? The year is 1988, the city is New Orleans, and the freshly announced GOP ticket is George H. W. Bush for president and Dan Quayle for vice president. Surprised? Well, plenty of people were stunned at the time, too.",
        "Presidential nominees choose vice presidential running mates for what they add to the ticket, whether it be experience or the capacity to draw votes. Here\u2019s what Mike Pence might subtract from this fall\u2019s Republican ticket with Donald Trump: an unknowable amount of campaign cash from the financial services industry. As governor of Indiana, Pence oversees state agencies that handle pension investments and municipal bonds. Federal rules impose harsh penalties on financial services firms if their employees solicit or make significant campaign contributions to local or state officials \u2014 such as Mike Pence.",
        "Mike Pence, newly chosen as Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, has a strong following among social conservatives for his stands on Planned Parenthood, gay marriage and other issues. Less noticed are his ties to conservatives. Pence has connections to the politically powerful armada of groups led by the billionaires David and Charles Koch. The ties are deep. But so far, they don\u2019t seem likely to bring badly needed Koch money into the presidential race.",
        "As Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan began control Saturday, he immediately pointed the finger of blame for the failed coup attempt against him. So who does he consider most responsible? A rogue general? Nope. Erdogan directed his outrage at an elderly, reclusive Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania\u2019s Poconos: Fethullah Gulen. \u201dI have a message for Pennsylvania: You have engaged in enough treason against this nation. If you dare, come back to your country,\u201d Erdogan said Saturday in reference to Gulen, not the entire Keystone State. Erdogan and Gulen used to be buddies. Both were considered moderate Islamists.",
        "The Islamic State group says one of its \u201dsoldiers\u201d mowed down a crowd celebrating Bastille Day Thursday night on the promenade in Nice, France, killing at least 84 people. It\u2019s a claim that we need to \u201dtake with caution,\u201d as NPR\u2019s Eleanor Beardsley reports from Nice. Speaking on Weekend Edition Saturday, she reports that according to French prosecutor Francois Molins, the suspect has Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel \u201dhas absolutely no links to jihadist networks, or Islamist radicals.\u201d French police have now detained five people in connection with the deadly attack.",
        "As what President Francois Hollande has described as \u201dthis unspeakable act\u201d was probably underway in Nice, my family and I were enjoying the same kind of Bastille Day festivities in Deauville, Normandy. The fireworks along the beach were spectacular, streaking the sky with stripes of red and blue and starbursts of bright, white light. Bastille Day is France\u2019s national holiday. It\u2019s just not the birth of the French Republic, but the start of summer, with long family meals and late night strolls, which the French believe in as a constitutional right.",
        "\u201dWhatever! Just leave me alone!\u201d Tammy stomps her feet up the stairs to the bedroom. A few moments later she slams the door, leaving for work. Jack is exasperated, angry and hurt. He wanted to rush outside and demand that Tammy treat him with respect. He imagined giving her the silent treatment until she apologized. But he knew this would prolong the fight and compound the resentment. He goes upstairs, tidies their room and does her laundry. He arranges some flowers on their nightstand and goes to work.",
        "Donald Trump is running for president as a Washington outsider. Yet to manage his campaign, he\u2019s picked someone who is very much a Washington insider. Paul Manafort has been a political operative and lobbyist for years, including for some controversial figures seeking to influence U. S. politics. For a candidate who loves to rail against the Washington establishment, Donald Trump\u2019s choice seems a bit of a . After all, as Manafort told a congressional hearing in 1989, \u201dthe technical term for what we do and what law firms, associations and professional groups do is lobbying.",
        "Andrew Mack, a former strategic planning director at the United Nations and now a fellow at the One Earth Future Foundation in Broomfield, Colo. coined the term \u201dasymmetric conflict\u201d back in 1975. His work analyzing trends in global violence for the Human Security Report Project helped inform Steven Pinker\u2019s thesis that the world is now a markedly less violent place than at any other time in history. Mack offered his thoughts in the aftermath of Thursday\u2019s terrorist attack in Nice, which left 84 dead: So how worrying are things now?",
        "Our world shares today much of what would be inaccessible if not for our unprecedented interconnectedness. We share car rides using smartphone apps. We share our spare rooms with strangers who don\u2019t simply want to be tourists in a new city. We share videos and photos of our good times and our bad \u2014 especially when our bad times include violent images and photos of people being attacked or killed.",
        "When you\u2019re making a movie that straddles the line between horror and comedy, and you need a musical score that makes it somehow both scarier and funnier, who you gonna call? In the case of this year\u2019s Ghostbusters reboot, that would be composer Theodore Shapiro. Shapiro has scored nearly 50 comedy films over the past 20 years, and most of them with a straight face. \u201dMy instincts as a composer are towards doing things that are serious,\u201d he says.",
        "Surely one of the hardest jobs at the Republican convention belongs to House Speaker Paul Ryan, who will preside over it. It\u2019s hard even though Ryan has said his responsibilities are largely ceremonial. His job is harder than that of Donald Trump fans, for whom the convention can be a celebration. It\u2019s trickier than that of Trump\u2019s remaining opponents, some of whom are not attending at all. Ryan is a Trump critic who has vowed to support him for the good of the Republican Party. On the surface, the two share little common ground.",
        "It was the summer of 1979, and disco was taking over the world. Donna Summer, Chic and Gloria Gaynor were at the top of the charts. Just a few months earlier, the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack had been named Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards. Radio stations were switching to formats. Steve Dahl, then a disc jockey, was mad. He had been fired from a Chicago radio station when it, too, went . In his new job at a rival rock station, he took out his frustration by destroying disco records on the air.",
        "Here\u2019s a different kind of thriller, of the sort often called \u201dliterary\u201d: Susie Steiner\u2019s Missing, Presumed follows British detective inspector Manon Bradshaw as she investigates the disappearance of Edith Hind, a university student from a family. But the book is much more than a detective thriller \u2014 it also takes a close look at its characters\u2019 personal lives.",
        "Mas Subramanian wasn\u2019t expecting blue. In 2009, as part of his lab at Oregon State University, Subramanian \u2014 a professor of materials science \u2014 was working with students to manufacture new materials that could be used in electronics. They would mix and grind chemicals, then heat them to over 2000 degrees Fahrenheit. One grad student, Andrew E.

        "It\u2019s only been out a week, but Pok\u00e9mon Go is making more money than a Meowth using Pay Day. According to Fortune, as of Thursday the augmented reality game already has over 65 million users in the United States alone. Quartz reports that those players are spending $1. 6 million per day on purchases. Those figures haven\u2019t escaped businesses \u2014 local and national alike \u2014 which were quick to catch on to the craze and its profitable potential.",
        "Last week, The Pok\u00e9mon Co. Nintendo and Niantic Inc. jointly released the augmented reality game Pok\u00e9mon Go. Played via a smartphone app that pulls in a mapping function, this is a \u201dreal world\u201d game that requires players to consult the Pok\u00e9mon Go map of their neighborhood (or wherever location they are visiting) then capture Pokemon characters. By visiting certain sites, including historic landmarks, the play is enhanced some activities become possible only at higher levels of achievement in the game."
