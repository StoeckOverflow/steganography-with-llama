        "While race is a subject many politicians choose to avoid, recent immigration has made that all but impossible. We \u2019 ve started to expect heartfelt memorial service after tragedies, but this week, something else happened : folks on both sides of the political aisle viewed the incidents in explicitly Christian terms. Yes, they talked about prayer and unity and compassion. But they also talked, in no uncertain terms, about racial divisions in America. Three senators in particular took the time to dig into these issues : President Barack Obama, Massachusetts Senator Tim Curry, and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.",

So about a year ago, I decided to create a series of stories about the people who harvest some of America \u2019 s top seasonal foods. Many of these workers move from place to place, following the harvest.

        "The man who drives a truck through packed areas celebrating Bastille Day, possibly more than 80, may have acted quickly, according to the early investigation. We don \u2019 t know if he was inspired by a jihadist attack or linked to any specific event. In any event, these extremist groups are currently embracing a \u201d lone wolf \u201d campaign, and the West should prepare for more such raids.

        "As the Republican National Convention arrives in Washington this weekend, the traditional buzz of enthusiasm is mixed with questions \u2014 not about the party \u2019 s presidential candidates, but about the threat of violent disruptions. A poll of Republican activists in southern states by Politico this month claimed that nearly half believed there to be some kind of violence around their convention this year. \u201d It \u2019 s probably more a matter of how bad it will get, \u201d said one particular Republican.
