        "Gregory Porter \u2019 s healing soul sometimes sends a message of sincerity, and he \u2019 s got a baritone vocal that resonates love. When Porter joined NPR, we \u2019 d just learned that our photographer, photojournalist David Gilkey, had been killed while working on a story for NPR in Afghanistan. When Porter began recording the calmly beautiful \u201d No Good Dying, \u201d he may not have known how much it would mean to us. Yet this song of faith and hope, from his 2013 album Liquid Air, was just what we \u2019 d needed.",
        "When most of us know about computer hacking, we picture Julian Assange leaking government secrets or a shadowy, crook in some former socialist republic hoovering up credit card info from a chain saw. But while folks like these do whip up all manner of trouble, a much deeper danger lies elsewhere.

This helps ensure that farmers don \u2019 t go belly up, and it really protects against food contamination. But are there unintended consequences?

        "In the summertime, the air is thick with the low humming of bees delivering pollen from one flower to the next. If you listen closely, a louder buzz may catch your ear.
