        "The recent multiple attacks on police in Alexandria and Baton Rouge have kept enforcement on edge. Some departments are telling officers to assemble in pairs when possible, and to be especially vigilant about possible ambush. Complicating matters is the question of how to interpret and respond to the presence of a gun. With more people now exercising their legal right to possession firearms, police find themselves having to make rapid judgments about whether an armed citizen is a firearm. While police are more sensitive to the presence of legal guns now, the dilemma isn \u2019 t a hard one.",
        "Members of the Wichita, Kan. police department spend Sunday afternoon drinking and talking with people from the area, at a cookout that was planned with the local Black Lives Matter movement. The event was called the Three Steps Community Cookout \u2014 a reference to its goal of bridging the gap between people and the community they serve. Taking place instead of a party that had been planned for Sunday, the cookout came about after Wichita Police Superintendent Gordon Ramsay had a private meeting with activist A. B.

        "It was supposed to be Indiana Gov. Mike Pence \u2019 s political comeback, but drama with Ted Turner largely overshadowed his moment at the Democratic National Convention. The situation quickly turned on Ryan on Wednesday night after he promised to endorse GOP nominee Donald Trump. The Texas senator and party primary was initially welcomed with a warm reception, greeting the crowd in the palm of his hand as he told emotional stories about the recent police shootings in Virginia and how America had to defend the law and the freedoms of speech and religion.",
        "In choosing Republican Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate, Donald Trump has reassured both Democratic republicans and social conservatives \u2014 but he has also selected someone who in many ways is his polar opposite. Pence attended the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night. As a popular talk show host in Indiana, Pence called himself \u201d Rush Limbaugh on decaf. \u201d The show followed two failed runs for mayor that landed Pence flat on his feet. His second run in 1992 was even more disastrous than the first.",
        "It \u2019 s no secret that President Trump is struggling to woo Hispanics easily. He \u2019 s currently polling closer with Latinos than Mitt Romney in 2012 ( In that election, Romney captured just 27 percent of the white vote. ). But on Wednesday evening, the Trump campaign may have a chance to shift its messaging when new Hispanic Republicans took center stage during election time. Two of them, former GOP presidential candidates, are fresh faces from the primary elections : Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco ( who will deliver a video message ).",

But the victims of the opioid epidemic are not all drug abusers. On a Tuesday night, three Montana residents, who call themselves Montana refugees, are boarding an aircraft from Missoula to Los Angeles. They know that finding doctors willing to treat chronic patients in Montana is almost impossible, and the only way they can get home is to fly out of state.",

Erdogan says it will make it more efficient to open up, question and try persons accused of supporting the government. \u201d Erdogan says its necessary to maintain the rule of law and justice, but he also made sure these would be used effectively against the cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former ally now accused of fomenting this failed coup, \u201d Peter says.",
        "A federal appeals court has ruled that a single voter ID requirement has a discriminatory effect on minority votes, and it has ordered a lower court to devise a remedy before the November vote. A district court had concluded not only that the law discriminated, but that it was intentionally intended to do so. The 5th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals saw some flaws in that conclusion and instructed the district court to reconsider that element of the case and rule again \u2014 preferably after Election Day.",

        "Ted Turner couldn \u2019 t even make it through thanking his own family without being overshadowed by Donald Trump. Before speaking at the Republican State Convention Wednesday night, the Texas senator and 2016 GOP chairman had gathered over 1, 200 of his volunteers and backers at a gathering on a dock along the Savannah waterfront, firing them up as though he was back at a campaign event. He hadn \u2019 t mentioned Trump at all, simply boasting of the victories they amassed in the state and just how close they came.",
        "Just last spring, I sat across from President Pavel Sheremet in Ukrainska Pravda \u2019 s media centre \u2014 a cavernous room and cafe tucked away in a small village in Ukraine \u2019 s capital, Kiev. Sheremet, a teddy bear of a man with an ominous presence and blue eyes that twinkled, was the driving force behind this center, which had a news department and was dedicated to investigative journalism. Sipping cappuccino, he explained that he had chosen Moscow as home because it allowed him to practice his craft.",

        "After repeatedly denying that elements of a 2008 speech by Michelle Obama were used in Melania Trump\u2019s address on the first night of the Republican National Convention, an employee of the Trump Organization took responsibility for the flap on Wednesday. In a statement issued by the Trump campaign, staff writer Meredith McIver accepted responsibility for the addition of Michelle Obama\u2019s words in the speech.

        "In the Banda district of Ghana, July is the hungry season. This year\u2019s sorghum, yams and millet are still young and green in the fields, and for most farmers, last year\u2019s harvest is long gone. People survive on cassava. They grind the roots and cook a porridge called tuo zaafe and they stir the leaves into a soup. But there isn\u2019t enough to go around always, and the meal lacks protein. It\u2019s hard to know whether autumn will bring more food: Rains in Banda have been erratic lately and harvests sparse.",
        "In the two weeks since Philando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer in Minnesota after being pulled over for a broken taillight, we\u2019ve learned that for Castile, routine traffic stops were far more routine than many people might imagine. For our latest podcast episode, which you can hear above, Code Switch\u2019s Gene Demby spoke to NPR reporters Cheryl Corley and Eyder Peralta, who took a closer look at the circumstances surrounding Castile\u2019s death.

Starting this week, America\u2019s largest grocer says it is piloting sales of apples at a discount in 300 of its stores in Florida.

He is now, officially, the running mate of Republican nominee Donald Trump. But before that happens, we want to take a dive into Pence\u2019s education policies in the nearly four years he\u2019s been the governor of Indiana.

        "I suspect I was about eight years old at the time I\u2019m remembering. I had to go to bed at 8:00 on school nights, except that one night a week, I could stay up until 8:30. I got to pick the night, and I generally picked Tuesdays, because that\u2019s when Happy Days was on.

        "The Odd Couple, Laverne Shirley, Happy Days, The Flamingo Kid, Pretty Woman: If you had to live on a deserted island, you could do far worse than to take the work of Hollywood legend Garry Marshall along to keep you company. The list of Marshall\u2019s popular work stretches even further, from his early time as a writer for The Tonight Show with Jack Paar, to multiple episodes of The Dick Van Dyke Show and The Lucy Show, and to Mork Mindy, the Robin Williams show that bridged the gap between the 1970s and \u201980s.",
        "Scott Stoddard is an expert when it comes to tomatoes. He plants rows and rows of tomatoes outdoors on farms across central California for the University of California Cooperative Extension. They\u2019re the kind of tomatoes that \u201dend up on sandwiches at Subway,\u201d Stoddard says. \u201dAlso, at any of your common hamburger places, McDonald\u2019s, you name it.\u201d Right now, those tomatoes taste fine and yield plenty. But Stoddard wishes they were more flavorful and produced an even larger crop. And he thinks he\u2019s found a way to do this by using a new twist on an old technique: grafting.",

        "On Thursday night, Donald Trump will accept the Republican nomination for the presidency of the United States. His brash, outsider persona might signal that his convention speech will be . .. well, unconventional. But his campaign is saying his speech will in fact be modeled on one from nearly 50 years ago: Richard Nixon\u2019s 1968 nomination acceptance speech. Nixon addressed a nation where outsider candidates had captured the people\u2019s attention where racial tension ran high and protests were a constant presence. Those echoes have led some commentators to draw parallels between today and 1968.",
