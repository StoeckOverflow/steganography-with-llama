        "An African bird called the greater honeyguide is good for leading people to play, and a new study suggests that the birds listen for even human calls to find out who wants to play. The study underscores the unique relationship that existed between humans and this wild game. \u201d They \u2019 re definitely not domesticated, and they \u2019 re in no way coerced, \u201d observed Claire Spottiswoode of the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom. \u201d And they \u2019 re not controlled in any conventional way as wolves.",

        "About three weeks ago, a \u201d eeeeeeeee \u201d sound started ringing in Linda McCartney \u2019 s ears. Sometimes, the noise would suddenly turn into a roar, sending Gray into panic mode. Her heartbeat would speed up. She \u2019 d need to find a quiet escape. \u201d You \u2019 re trying to escape it. It \u2019 s called, \u2019 Turn this off! \u2019 \u201d she says.

        "Toddlers make their fair share of noise. But they also have a lot of noise to contend with \u2014 a music blaring, siblings squabbling, a car radio blasting, grownups talking. Amid all that clatter, toddlers must eventually piece together the sound of individual words and sounds to form their own words and words. Loud background noise would make it harder for toddlers to speak language, according to a study published Thursday in the magazine Child Development. Two other studies have already proven that background noise can improve children \u2019 s abilities to think.",

Hundreds of feet of stuff was piled on the floor and some of it \u2014 supposed to look like a plaster wall \u2014 was hung from the ceiling for it to finish drying.

This DIY culture of inventors, tinkerers and hackers is inspiring adults and children alike to design and build everything from sailboats and apps to solar cars. And this fall, more of these chaotic workspaces, stocked with glue guns, drills and hammers, will be popping up in schools, too. But the maker movement faces some big hurdles as it pushes into classrooms.",
        "Smack in the middle of this summer of American political and societal turmoil, I\u2019m hearing a lot about how important it is to seek out and listen to people whose ideas diverge from one\u2019s own. None of us should want to dwell in an echo chamber. Taking up this philosophy, today I embark on a series of conversations (to appear about once a month) with people whose ideas diverge significantly from my own. The goal? To get past assumptions, to open up a space for dialogue, and see what happens. First up: hunting. Harry W.",

        "Tim Kaine is boring. Just ask him. \u201dI am boring,\u201d the man Hillary Clinton picked on Friday night to be her running mate said last month on NBC\u2019s Meet The Press. The Virginia senator tried to play it off with something of a dad joke: \u201dBut boring is the demographic in this country,\u201d he said with a laugh.

        "Throughout the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this week, there was a persistent and obvious theme of discord on repeat. Call it \u201dMusic vs. Meaning\u201d and let us sing some of its many verses: Musicians expressed resentment at Donald Trump and his party\u2019s use of their songs. Acts \u2014 both on and off the arena floor \u2014 tried to send messages, with varied levels of success, about their political views. Intentionally or not, the possible future First Lady snuck a viral refrain from a 1987 pop song into a speech that was already problematic."
