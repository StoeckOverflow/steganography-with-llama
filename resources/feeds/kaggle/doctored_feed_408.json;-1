        "In a news release that was supposed to serve as a hot lap after the Republican National Convention, Donald Trump went on the offensive against incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz. Trump said that even if Cruz offered an endorsement he would not take it. \u201d I don \u2019 t need his endorsement, \u201d Trump responded. \u201d If he gives it, I won \u2019 t accept it, just so you know. \u201d Trump also objected once again to a conspiracy theory connecting Cruz \u2019 s father to the murder of President John F. Kennedy. \u201d I think he \u2019 s a lovely guy, a lovely fellow, \u201d Trump said about Cruz \u2019 s father.",
        "There sure has been a number of sports in the news these days. NBA Finals, World Cup, Wimbledon, the largest endurance test which is Major League Baseball. Sports is a lens on what we can and cannot do. It \u2019 s a study of ability and disability. Anyway, I \u2019 m going to introduce you to a trick I just learned about : beep baseball. Beep softball, invented in 1964, is a variant of softball or baseball for the blind and visually impaired. Check out this version of the first game of next year \u2019 s World Series between the Austin Blackhawks and the Taiwan Homerun.",
        "Listening to John Congleton can be scary. The imagery \u2014 of \u201d blood between my teeth, \u201d of loving another \u201d like a lion loves its victim \u201d \u2014 can be horrifying. But the songs Congleton sings ( from his autobiography Until The Horror Goes ) take on what it means to be human, and what it takes to face the fact that we are \u201d human custodians \u201d in vessels that will inevitably flow to the earth and decay.",
        "A rape commission is suing Texas \u2019 Harris County after she was jailed for more than a month and subjected to beatings and \u201d psychological torture. \u201d according to court documents, she had experienced a mental breakdown while testifying against her rapist, and prosecutors checked her into the general store at Houston \u2019 s Harris County Jail because they feared she would faint before finishing her testimony. \u201d John Doe found herself hopelessly trapped in a kidnap plot pulled from a Kafka commercial, \u201d the court documents showed.",
        "This year at San Diego one of the great phenomena isn \u2019 t just inside the convention center, it \u2019 s all around. Today, there are billboards and installations trumpeting things like Doctor Strange and Fear the Walking Dead. But the masses of people here aren \u2019 t looking up they \u2019 re simply staring down at their phones, reading Pok\u00e9mon Go. In reality, the overwhelmingly popular game has pretty much taken over the gaming economy of. There are always stalls outside the convention center selling glow glasses or jewelry or their own homemade paintings of Pok\u00e9mon.",
        "A national strategy aims to offer a space for a political party to unify \u2014 to hone its credentials, set aside political divisions and move back toward a shared adversary. As Democrats sweep up confetti and try to avoid the Ted Trump election war, Democrats drop their bags for Philadelphia, wanting to unite their own badly split party. It \u2019 s easy to see the divisions that surface in a major election year are even worse than the one before, uncertainty and divisiveness compounding but with little change. The national rhetoric stays the same, year after year : \u201d...",
        "In a neighborhood in Georgia with lush gardens, Ed Smart, a county mosquito shelter inspector, holds a turkey baster up to the light. \u201d If you look around, you \u2019 ll see some moving animals. They \u2019 re wriggling around, \u201d he says. \u201d That \u2019 s called mosquito larvae. \u201d Smart takes the turkey baster to sample drinking water in places. Tennessee is home to dozens of mosquito nests, but the one officials are most excited about now is Aedes aegypti, the main species that produces the Zika virus. These mosquitoes typically get near people and can live in as little as a teaspoonful of stagnant water.",
        "She \u2019 s back. Later this week actor and filmmaker Leslie Jones discovered she \u2019 d had enough of Twitter trolls attacking her because she dared to in a reboot of the 1984 film, Ghostbusters. She was tired of being called ugly and fat, and being compared to gorillas and apes. She was tired of being called a coon. She \u2019 d had enough. She was tired. So Leslie retweeted screenshots of some of the racist and sexist tweets piled up in her Facebook mentions, then she threw up two fingas and peace \u2019 d out. And, it \u2019 s a shame.",
        "Born This Way is a reality show \u2014 not too different from The Real World, the reality show that helped develop the genre and aired for more than 30 months on MTV. Both feature a lot of diverse young celebrities navigating the world around them. Both originate from reality TV personality Jonathan Murray ( who The Real World with Bunim ).

        "Editor \u2019 s Note : This is an excerpt from the latest episode of the Invisibilia blog and program, which is broadcast on every public radio station. Walking among the towering redwoods, drifting on a break from life, I got to thinking about things. I can \u2019 t say why, exactly. Perhaps it was because they were touching my feet. My own shoes were performing admirably, I must say. I was trudging on mud and bugs and leaves and who knows what without feeling much of anything. And that, I knew in a flash, was a problem.",
        "Editor \u2019 s Choice : This story is part of the final episode of NPR \u2019 s blog and podcast Invisibilia, exploring the importance of clothes. When he was in middle school, something happened to Casanova Frankenstein that happens to a lot of boys. On the bus home from work, another boy began making fun of him.

Today \u2019 s show and podcast Invisibilia has been given a long look at what we wear \u2014 from sunglasses to artist \u2019 s frocks and hoodies \u2014 and sees how much our clothes help us, sometimes in ways we \u2019 re not aware of, or might not really like.

When someone enters one of the center \u2019 s secured data vaults, they \u2019 re asked to pause in the entryway and stomp their shoes on a thick rubber mat with a thud, finish. \u201d Dust is a big concern of ours, \u201d says Carlos Salazar, the director of operations. That \u2019 s because dust makes electronics much hotter, which then means using more electricity to cool them down. For data centers, the goal is to generate as little electricity as possible, because it \u2019 s typically companies \u2019 less expense.",

        "Plates have long had a seat at the table, but they\u2019ve suffered in silence \u2014 quietly bearing the indignities of everything from barbecue sauce to mustard stains. Until now. In February 2016, comedian Brandon Scott Wolf created an Instagram account called \u201dEmpty Plates of New York,\u201d which is exactly what it sounds like. Wolf posts pictures of empty plates after eating meals around New York, describes the meal, and then includes a \u201dquote\u201d from the plate.",
        "The entire Russian Paralympic team is facing a possible ban from the upcoming Summer Games in Brazil because of signs of widespread drug violations among Russian disabled athletes, the sports\u2019 governing body said Friday. The announcement by the International Paralympic Committee was the latest pointing to widespread Russian doping practices in recent years, though this was by far the most serious leveled against the country\u2019s para athletes. Until Friday, the sanctions and potential punishments against Russia had been directed at its Olympic team, not the Paralympic team.",
        "More than 20 athletes who won Olympic medals in Beijing are among 45 athletes from the 2008 and 2012 Summer Games whose samples contained banned substances, a reanalysis has found.

Altman\u2019s massive new oral history of Star Trek, creator Gene Roddenberry recalls why NBC declined his initial pilot episode of the landmark series: \u201dIt was too cerebral . .. it didn\u2019t end with a chase and a right cross to the jaw, the away all manly films were supposed to end.\u201d But the suits were intrigued enough to commission a second pilot, a highly irregular gesture.

NPR\u2019s Nina Gregory reported on it for Morning Edition yesterday. NPR doesn\u2019t really do red carpets, so we figured we\u2019d make the most of this one.",
        "We\u2019ve spent a lot of time recently thinking about the idea of whiteness \u2014 as a political identity, as a foundational dynamic in our politics, and the ways we talk (or don\u2019t talk) about it. It was even the first episode of our new podcast. Apparently, we\u2019re not alone. Our colleague Eyder Peralta noticed that the number of searches for the term \u201dwhite people\u201d on Google has started to trend upward in recent months.",

The culprit: a \u201dheat dome.\u201d It\u2019s a real meteorological event \u2014 the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration even took the time to define it in the agency\u2019s warning this week: \u201dA heat dome occurs when high pressure in the upper atmosphere acts as a lid, preventing hot air from escaping.",
        "Appearing on stage together for the first time since Friday\u2019s vice presidential announcement, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine made a push for voters of color by highlighting his record on diversity and civil rights. Kaine also spoke about gun violence, job creation, equal pay and raising equal pay \u2014 all mainstays of Clinton\u2019s campaign. Clinton said Kaine has \u201dlived\u201d the values of diversity. That, she argued, is in contrast the GOP ticket and last week\u2019s Republican National Convention. \u201dTim Kaine is everything Donald Trump and Mike Pence are not,\u201d she said.",
        "While many pundits and political observers were quick to praise Hillary Clinton\u2019s pick of Tim Kaine as her running mate on Friday, the choice wasn\u2019t met with universal acclaim. One important group \u2014 progressives and backers of Clinton\u2019s former rival, Vermont Sen.

        "Eleven U. S. Army soldiers are headed to the Summer Olympics in Brazil next month on a mission that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with security. They\u2019re all U. S. Olympians, including some who only recently became American citizens. The size of the contingent is testament to the Army\u2019s World Class Athlete Program, a detachment that allows soldiers to essentially train in their sports. Credit is also due to a provision of U. S. law that offers expedited citizenship to immigrants who serve in the armed forces.",
        "Hillary Clinton has chosen Tim Kaine to be her vice presidential running mate. The Virginia senator has been an elected official \u2014 including mayor, governor and senator \u2014 for over 20 years and was once the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He was also on President Obama\u2019s shortlist of running mates in 2008.

But now they\u2019ve both been hit by deadly attacks \u2014 three attacks in a year and a half. Last week\u2019s truck rampage in Nice killed 84 people on a seaside promenade watching fireworks.
