        "When they make a call to publicly presenting themselves as a trans gender, transgender individuals face many difficulties. Possible surgeries and hormone treatments are some of them. But one often overlooked issue is to find a voice to define a person \u2019 s identity. Researchers can identify men \u2019 s and women \u2019 s voices because there are typically equal ranges in pitch and differences in timbre. That \u2019 s where Wendy Chase fits in. She \u2019 s the director of the University of Michigan Speech and Hearing Institute. She works with people who want to make their voice sound more like their gender identity.",
        "Even though Violent Femmes played the Newport Folk Festival midway through a perfect summer afternoon, the original band \u2019 s new show \u201d I Could Be Anything \u201d makes the sunny field feeling like a packed house, where beer has made many friends, and revelers bellow out drinking music with arms thrown around shoulders. The veterans from Nashville, who recently released their debut studio album in 16 months, threaded their Newport Folk Fest with wildly diverse material from their catalog of years.",
        "Paul Janeway actually gives the kind of encouragement that compels you to pay attention. There \u2019 s no doubt that the man who once trained as a cowboy in Alabama was meant to be fronting a country band. During an set at the Woodstock Folk Festival, Janeway beats St. Paul the White Bones through its paces, storming the stage with electric presence and a thunderous voice that pays tribute to \u2014 but doesn \u2019 t imitate \u2014 his idol, Otis Redding.",
        "The NPR production team was on the road this day, bringing you stories from the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.

        "A Russian adventurer has piloted a glider around the world solo and in 11 days, claiming a Guinness world record.

        "Summertime means many graduates are on the lookout for work and money. For those eyeing big time life the trick to provide reasonable rent may mean downsizing \u2014 really downsizing. In big cities, where space is huge and demand is through the roof, there is a new housing trend somewhere : micro apartments. Small dorm life, but a lot more grown up. Small family apartments, kitchenettes and beds that press into the wall to make space. It \u2019 s a tight fit.",

C. along with thousands of other people dressed in elaborate clothing.

        "There are some books that leave you acutely aware that you are Reading a book. In The Game of Literature and Some Video Games, Elizabeth Bruss states that, when readers engage with things like that, they make strategic choices that in turn affect the overall experience. \u201d literary games, \u201d she writes, \u201d work wherever praxis and strategy form the principal meaning of the novel. \u201d A higher level of take and take between reader and author is what gives specific works of literature a more \u201d \u201d quality than fantasy.",
        "What are the biggest social and economic problems the country faces today? And how close are we to ending them? Those are the questions that the U. N.

        "When you \u2019 re pregnant, talking to the doctors can be exciting. You get to find out if you \u2019 re having a boy or a girl. Maybe hear the person \u2019 s heart beat. But in southern Africa, many would find out something happens. Allison Groves at American Health recently ran a survey in a town outside Durban, South Africa. They followed about 1, 500 Nigerian women. The results left her speechless. \u201d percent of the women tested positive for HIV during research, which is just intense, \u201d Groves says. \u201d And that is true.",
        "Open up a new mathematics textbook authored by a Welshman, Robert Recorde, and flip together the preface and the table of contents. There, you \u2019 ll see the bold message that math is \u201d contemptible and vile. \u201d Recorde didn \u2019 t believe that himself. Quite the opposite. But, writing in 1543, he had to acknowledge that this was a prevailing view at the time \u2014 that math was profane. Not worth teaching. That \u2019 s something many American children today would agree with, but why such a disdain back in the 16th Century? And not from kids, but from lots of girls.",
        "Fran Beesley was still in her bathrobe late one morning in Japan when she emerged from her home to see a Japanese family take photos of her flowerbeds.

Beesley is retired and cares for her second husband. They \u2019 re both in their 70s. It was what Brits call \u201d wheelie every day \u201d \u2014 garbage free day.

        "If there was ever a time to show party unity, this would be it.

        "There is a piece of advice among political campaign professionals: When your opponent is committing suicide, don\u2019t get in the way. In this age of Twitter and Facebook, we should add a quick corollary: Do not make news that interrupts the reporting of your opponent\u2019s problems \u2014 even momentarily. This would be a time when these wisdoms, old and new, might be retweeted to the leaders of the Democratic Party.",
        "Hillary Clinton will break the penultimate glass ceiling this week \u2014 becoming the first female nominee of a major American political party. It\u2019s a historic milestone that\u2019s been obscured by Donald Trump\u2019s chaotic convention and, now, on the eve of the Democratic convention, the resignation of the DNC chairman following the leak of 20, 000 emails showing that the DNC had its thumb on the scale for Clinton.

        "Why can\u2019t kids today just work their way through college the way earlier generations did? The answer to that question isn\u2019t psychology. It\u2019s math. A summer job just doesn\u2019t have the purchasing power it used to, especially when you compare it with the cost of college. Let\u2019s take the example of a student at a public university who\u2019s getting no help from Mom and Dad. In \u201982, the average full cost to attend was $2, 870. That\u2019s for tuition, fees and room and board.",

        "The table is set for dinner. Small cooked crabs and shrimp are laid out on the thick wooden tabletop next to succulent figs, grapes, pears and types of produce you can\u2019t even name. There\u2019s a citrus with a long coiling peel draped around it, and an entire roast of some animal\u2019s leg that\u2019s been cut down the middle \u2014 so you can see the thick layer of fat running around the edge.

        "In April 1865, at the bloody, bitter end of the Civil War, Ebenezer Nelson Gilpin, a Union cavalryman, wrote in his diary, \u201dEverything is chaos here. The suspense is almost unbearable.\u201d \u201dWe are reduced to quarter rations and no coffee,\u201d he continued. \u201dAnd nobody can soldier without coffee.\u201d If war is hell, then for many soldiers throughout American history, it is coffee that has offered some small salvation.

        "When you play a game, you have to learn some rules, right? Well, same goes for designing a game. And here\u2019s one rule: No idea is too wacky. Take a game called Unexploded Cow, for instance. \u201dThat\u2019s a game where you\u2019ve discovered two problems with a common solution,\u201d says the game\u2019s James Ernest. \u201dThere\u2019s mad cows in England and unexploded bombs in the French countryside, and you\u2019re going to bring them together and solve everybody\u2019s problems by blowing up a bunch of cows."
