        "There was barely a shadow in the sky all weekend at the 2016 Seattle Folk Festival this entire weekend. But the uninterrupted stretch of three gloriously sunny days wasn \u2019 t the only bit of good fortune festivalgoers experiencing. Each day at Fort Davis State Park in Sheridan, R. I. was filled with unexpected guests and moments of serendipity. Even legendary country star Kris Kristofferson showing up unannounced to record \u201d Me and Bobby McGee \u201d with gospel star Margo Price.",
        "Novelists have always seen their heroines through awful ordeals. But over time, these tribulations increased. Where the 19th Century was filled with violent women trapped in punishing men \u2014 think of Middlemarch or The Portrait of a Queen \u2014 today \u2019 s heroines face issues that are bigger, more political, and more socially demanding. They fight in violent games. This fight takes a different form in The Ancient Way of Things, a ferocious political novel by the Australian Peter Wood whose title recalls the early Dante Ferrante \u2014 it \u2019 s tough, direct, and makes no attempt to be ingratiating.",
        "The baristas have spoken, and Starbucks is thinking : The company says it \u2019 s loosening its dress code for employees. Nevertheless, the green aprons remain, but you soon begin noticing more subtle flair underneath. A company also invites baristas \u201d to shine as usual while continuing to present a clean, neat and professional face. \u201d No longer must Starbucks staff choose between plain white and white tops. The company says \u201d a range of new colors \u201d and subtle colors are now permitted \u2014 though it \u2019 s still a pretty narrow space, in subdued tones you could call \u201d drabby chic \u201d ( think grays, navys and browns ).",

Sometimes, you want to know which people, events and stories you can \u2019 t follow.

        "Roger Federer won \u2019 t be played at the Olympics in Rio one month \u2014 or anywhere else, for the rest of the year. In an update on Facebook, he says he expected \u201d more extensive rehabilitation \u201d after heart surgery earlier this month.

        "A district court in Texas has dismissed the six remaining criminal case against two activists who covertly broadcast videos of themselves attempting to steal fetal tissue from Planned Parenthood. David Daleiden and John Merritt used fake IDs when they ran the organization. They were indicted for tampering with police records, a felony charge. Those charges have now been dismissed on technical merits. An attorney for the pair believes it \u201d a huge win for Second Amendment rights, \u201d ESPN \u2019 s Jennifer Ludden reports.",
        "Charles Kinsey, a former health worker, was thrust into the national debate about murder and after video of police shooting him went viral. Just over a year before, Alton Sterling and Philando Castile used familiar names and hashtags announcing their shooting deaths by police, and the videos of those incidents went across traditional and mass media. But fewer viewers know about Delrawn Small, an officer was shot to death by an sniper in early July.",
        "About four years ago, Kevin Sinclair inherited an army of clones. Very fluffy clones. \u201d Janice, Debbie, Denise and Dolly, \u201d says Sinclair, a molecular biologist at the University of Exeter in England. The sheep are just two of 13 clones that Sinclair shepherds, but they \u2019 re the most famous because of their similarity to Dolly, the sheep that made headlines two months ago as the first completely cloned mammal. \u201d \u2019 Sister clones \u2019 probably everyone describes them, \u201d Sinclair says.",

        "The auto maker is watching to see whether Tesla, which has its roots in the tech industry of Silicon Valley, can carry off its goal of mass marketing cars. The goal hit a road bump in May when Tesla had its first fatality in a vehicle named Autopilot, a feature it offers that encourages the car to do a lot of the talking. It \u2019 s supposed to be an assist. Before you see it, it warns you not to take your hands off the wheel. But will sometimes behave like children.",
        "It used to be one of the worst places in the world when it came to protecting children. A 2007 Violence Against Children report coordinated by UNICEF and the Center for Birth Control and Prevention reported one in three girls in Swaziland was sexually abused before age 18. ( The global rate is 1 in 5, according to the World Health Organisation. ) The next year, the nation ranked near the lowest of all African nations for adopting a measure that includes providing protections for children and spending on measures like education and child care.",
        "Helen Gurley Jones, the tiny, tough and conservative of Cosmopolitan, who transformed the staid family home and took circulation to giddy heights, did so by lubricating its pages with one rule : sex. Make that count. Under her bold auspices, the once stolidly female magazine gleefully smashed the gender taboos by pushing single men to play by the same sexual laws that applied to men. Marriage, sermonized Cosmopolitan, should be uncoupled from marriage, made and taught to all women.",
        "When you start leaving for a reporting trip to Russia, you get a lot of attention. Take a clean laptop, advised my journalist friend in Moscow. Take a clean laptop. That means everything that has been wiped and and from which I \u2019 ve never logged on with my personal user accounts and passwords. The problem? Russian intelligence will be tracking you from the moment you land, they said. \u201d Really? \u201d I replied.",

        "Several times a month, Jessica Wen, a pediatrician specializing in liver diseases, has a teenager show up at her clinic at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia with an unexpected diagnosis: hepatitis C. Hepatitis C virus, or HCV, is the most common bloodborne infection in the U. S. and a leading cause of liver failure and cancer.

        "A new White House report on student loan debt reveals that how people repay student loans has changed dramatically in a short time. The report comes as the Democratic Party moves this week to nominate Hillary Clinton, who has called for a path to public college, interest rate cuts, help for delinquent borrowers and a moratorium on all student loan payments. Such campaign promises are a nod to debt trends that have loomed ever larger over the middle class for a while now. The overall outstanding student loan balance is $1.",
        "The third night of the 2016 Democratic convention scaled several major peaks: President Obama gave, perhaps, the oration of his career. Vice President Joe Biden gave, perhaps, his last national convention address, and his prospective successor, Tim Kaine, gave his first. But when it was all over, and Obama was joined on stage by the woman who wants to succeed him, you could feel the love welling up from the delegates and you could sense the doubt hanging over them \u2014 an invisible cloud casting a psychological shadow.",

        "Democrats called on Americans to reject what they called the politics of fear and division of the GOP and elect Hillary Clinton during the third day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. Everyone from President Obama to Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine contrasted the Democratic vision of America with the vision offered by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. \u201dAmerica is already great,\u201d President Obama said. \u201dAmerica is already strong. And I promise you, our strength, our greatness does not depend on Donald Trump.\u201d Obama reached back to the themes of his 2008 campaign.",
        "Hillary Rodham\u2019s 1969 commencement address at Wellesley College did not stand out because of what she said. It stood out because of how she said it, and because she said it at all. This is a story not about words, but about context. Before 1969, Wellesley had never had a student speaker at commencement. Administrators spoke and special guests spoke, but students at this women\u2019s college didn\u2019t have a voice on graduation day. Eldie Acheson, a classmate of Hillary Clinton, then Hillary Rodham, led the effort to have a student speak at their commencement.",

        "Healthy young women can be forgiven for being confused about how often they\u2019re supposed to be getting in to see their primary care doctor. After all, annual checkups in general have come under scrutiny. Doctors who have reviewed the data say there is little scientific evidence to support routine pelvic exams or clinical breast exams in women who have no symptoms. Cervical cancer screening is now recommended only every three years. Even a routine blood test to measure cholesterol levels isn\u2019t recommended for women under 45.",
        "Amid two troubling investigations at the University of Louisville, school President James Ramsey resigned Wednesday. The university is facing scrutiny over separate scandals that involve allegations of financial misdeeds and sex parties for athletes. Ramsey will receive a $690, 000 settlement and has agreed not to sue the school, as Kate Howard of member station WFPL in Louisville reports. His exit comes months after Kentucky Gov.

        "America\u2019s first image of Chelsea Clinton was as a preteen girl with braces who shied away from the public stage while her father was president in the 1990s. More than two decades later, the now mother of two will voluntarily step into the spotlight to introduce her own mother as her family seeks a return to the White House. The only daughter of Bill and Hillary Clinton, Chelsea has never seemed completely comfortable with public life the way her parents have.",

        "There\u2019s a new book out about the student loan crisis, or what author Sandy Baum suggests is a \u201dbogus crisis.\u201d Baum, a financial aid expert and senior fellow at the Urban Institute, claims it has been manufactured by the media in search of a spicy story and fueled by politicians pushing \u201ddebt free college\u201d proposals. We had a few questions for Baum about the book, Student Debt: Rhetoric and Realities of Higher Education. Roughly 43 million people today hold more than $1. 3 trillion in student loan debt. And many are struggling to pay the money back.",
        "For decades, Japanese fishermen have told stories about the existence of a dark, rare beaked whale that they called karasu \u2014 the \u201draven.\u201d But now, scientists say they have genetic proof to back up these tales. Long mistaken for its relative, the Baird\u2019s beaked whale, scientists say it represents an entirely new species. \u201dThere have been a lot of people out there surveying whales for a long time and never come across this in scientific research,\u201d Phillip Morin, research molecular geneticist at the NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center, tells The .",
        "The federal government released its first overall hospital quality rating on Wednesday, slapping average or below average scores on many of the nation\u2019s hospitals while awarding top scores to many unheralded ones. The Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services rated 3, 617 hospitals on a to scale, angering the hospital industry, which has been pressing the Obama administration and Congress to block the ratings.
