        "Most Americans will throw their first real glimpse at Tim Kaine when he speaks at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday night. Of all the people Hillary Clinton considered as her favourite presidential running mate, he has the most experience at all levels of office. But there is an irony in the Virginia Governor \u2019 s career. In the heart of the Southern Confederacy, Kaine \u2019 s rise has been motivated in part by his personal commitment to racial reconciliation.",
        "As a teenager, William Alan McPherson served as a waiter on the Great Northern Railroad. The experience moved him as a man and as a writer he could spend his life producing short fiction and fiction exploring race and racism in America \u2014 the gulf separating white privilege from the black majority. One of his first published stories, \u201d On Trains, \u201d included in his fiction collection Hue and Sing, chronicles a white gentleman \u2019 s unthinking treatment of black waiters and porters on a railroad, and subtly reveals its lingering effects on all involved.",
        "In the U. K. the headlines note the work of a \u201d Dances With Wolves actor. \u201d But performing in an film was one of the least interesting things David William Beautiful Bald Eagle ever did. Bald Eagle dies last Friday at 97. In his short, extraordinary life, he was a talented dancer \u2014 both ballroom and Lakota styles \u2014 a touring musician, a rodeo performer, a tribal chief, an astronaut, a stunt double, a sports hero. He danced with Marilyn Monroe. He drove sports cars. He parachuted into enemy territory at Normandy. He played college baseball.",
        "First Lady Michelle Obama on CNN referenced a bit of writing in her speech at the Democratic National Convention that has both surprised and angered many. \u201d That is the story of this world, the story that has brought me to this moment tonight, the story of millions of people who felt the lash of bondage, the fear of servitude, the sting of segregation, but who focused on striving and hoping and doing what needed to be done so that today I wake up every morning in a house that was populated by slaves, \u201d she said.",
        "With super bacteria on the rise, researchers are on an extensive hunt for other bacteria that could yield chemicals we can use as powerful drugs. Researchers once found most of these helpful compounds in soil, but in recent times this search location hasn \u2019 t helped. Now, researchers at the University of T\u00fcbingen in Switzerland say that to find at least one promising organism, we need look no further than our own noses.",
        "The Mendenhall Glacier is accessible from the visitor center parking lot. But it \u2019 s still pretty far and if you traveled all the way to Juneau, Alaska, you probably want to get up close to the blue tinted ice. Touching the face of the glacier can be tricky. You \u2019 re separated by cold, silty rocks, and a hike over the ridge would take hours. Visitor center staff know that. And often, they use it to prove a point.",
        "There was a time when Mrs Gologergen \u2019 s freezer never ran out. Packed with native Inuit foods like fish, walrus, seal and fish, her freezer has been an integral lifeline, ensuring her husband, five kids and grandson made it through the long harsh winter of Savoonga, Alaska. \u201d Then that changed, \u201d she continues. Warmer winters and changing living conditions meant hunters were unable to bag the abundant walrus the Savoonga residents traditionally rely on as a key food item. Three years ago, the situation became so dire, the governor declared the region an economic disaster to quickly loosen assistance funds.",
        "Jupiter \u2019 s Great Red Spot is such a big, turbulent storm that it generates sound waves that go hundreds of miles up and continuously heat the planet \u2019 s thick atmosphere. That \u2019 s the conclusion of researchers who found a striking hotspot high above the Great Red Spot. They describe their finding together in the journal Nature. The Great Red Spot is a great storm about 10, 000 miles across \u2014 around 1. 5 times the height of Earth. \u201d It \u2019 s the largest cyclone in the solar system, \u201d says James O \u2019 Donoghue, a researcher at Rice University \u2019 s Center for Solar Physics.",
        "Whatever South Korean women are thinking, pass it around! The industry is having a massive growth spurt. And it doesn \u2019 t sound like it \u2019 s slowing down anytime soon. Women in South Korea have gained 8 feet in height, on average, in the past century \u2014 a jump higher than any other population in the world, researchers reported Tuesday. For decades, Iranians are the big winners, growing 6. 5 inches in the past two years. In contrast, girls are falling behind. Already in 1914, the U. S. had the third biggest men and fourth largest women in the world.",
        "Most critics of the new government have been frightened into hiding these days. The country is charged with rooting out backers of this month \u2019 s failed assassination attempt \u2014 an ongoing purge has caused tens of thousands of citizens. But it \u2019 s still possible to find Turks willing to argue about why they oppose both the July 15 coup attempt and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2019 s initial reaction, saying legitimate criticism must not be silenced.",
        "The Turkish government has cracked down on independent journalism since an attempted arrest on July 15, shutting down at least 45 newspapers and 16 TV networks, The Associated Press said. On Wednesday, the news organization Anadolu Agency reported 47 search warrants had been issued for employees of the magazine Zaman, and 13 people had been detained. Zaman and a local publication were raided by authorities in March for their supposed ties to the Hizmet religious movement led by exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Ankara.",
        "Three months ago, Egypt \u2019 s military carried out a swift and violent coup, ousting a conservative former ruler and party that had been banned. A part of Turkey \u2019 s rebel forces attempted a very quick overthrow on July 15. In both nations, the two most populous in the nation, democracy suffered a setback in the wake of the military actions. The events mostly end there. In Turkey, the coup failed in part, it seems, because of the country \u2019 s long and often bitter fear of military takeovers. Both supporters and opposition quickly united around President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",
        "Dead men tell no tales, but their phones might. Early last month, two detectives walked into the lab of Anil Jain, a professor of computer science and engineering at Michigan State University. They had heard of Jain\u2019s work in fingerprint recognition and wanted his help in a murder investigation. The detectives brought the victim\u2019s locked Samsung Galaxy S6 phone and a copy of his fingerprints, as he had been previously arrested.",
        "It\u2019s summer, and whether you\u2019re 5 years old or 105 it\u2019s time to play. To inspire you, the NPR Ed Team called up leaders and designers at 10 of the nation\u2019s best children\u2019s museums and asked them one simple question: What\u2019s the one thing under your roof (or maybe out back) that kids and their love to the most? Here are their answers, our summer \u201dplaylist.\u201d 1. Adventure Expeditions \u2014 Port Discovery Children\u2019s Museum, Baltimore. This interactive exhibit doesn\u2019t just shake the dust off the traditional children\u2019s museum experience.",
        "Hillary Clinton is no stranger to speaking at political conventions \u2014 she has done it four times before. But nothing will compare to the pressure and expectations she faces tonight when she will accept the Democratic nomination for president, becoming the first woman of a major political party ever to do so. She is expected to hit opponent Donald Trump but also lay out her own vision for America \u2014 likely a more positive take on the country than her GOP rival, and more in the style of President Obama\u2019s speech Wednesday night.",
        "Earlier this year, a girl was shot and badly wounded during a firefight between U. S. and Afghan forces and the Taliban. Her father, a Taliban fighter, her mother and some siblings were all killed in the gun battle. Dr. Chance Henderson, a orthopedic surgeon, was there when the girl, whom NPR is calling Ameera, was brought to the hospital at the Bagram Airfield outside Kabul. \u201dI remember her quite vividly there on that stretcher, and how tiny she looked,\u201d he says.",
        "Flour seems innocuous. We\u2019ve long been warned to wash our hands after handling chicken, and to cook our hamburgers well. We wash lettuce that came straight from the field. But really, flour? This week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reminded everyone that flour is, in fact, a raw, uncooked food, just like those fresh greens. Yes, it can make you sick. The agency announced that 46 people, so far, have been sickened by E. coli that apparently contaminated flour sold by General Mills. The first case was reported seven months ago, and the outbreak continues.",
        "Researchers have found a curious purple orb near California\u2019s Channel Islands \u2014 and it\u2019s left them stumped. To our untrained eye, it looks a little like a really dazzling Christmas ornament. Alternatively, Smithsonian compared it to an unhatched Pokemon. During the recent expedition, unnamed scientists from the Nautilus exploration vessel are recording and chatting about what they\u2019re seeing when they come across the mysterious, beautiful blob. Watch their video here: \u201dWhat is that?\u201d \u201d\u2019I\u2019m stumped. I have no idea. I can\u2019t even hazard a guess to phylum,\u201d the team says.",
        "Growing up in South Carolina, soul singer Sharon Jones knew from the first time she sang in her church\u2019s Christmas play that she would be a musician. \u201dI was, like, maybe 8, 9 years old . .. and I got to sing \u2019Silent Night,\u2019\u201d she tells Fresh Air host Terry Gross. Jones remembers audience members taking note of her performance. \u201dRight then and there,\u201d she says, \u201dI knew that I was going to be a singer.",
        "Immigration is an intricate part of the history of the United States. But in 2012, a new trend appeared: juveniles traveling alone showed up at the border in huge numbers. President Obama became alarmed, and two years later visited Central America and the border to send a message of deterrence to parents and minors who were planning to make the journey north.",
        "\u201dI am the candidate.\u201d With that proclamation in his acceptance speech, Donald Trump made it official that he\u2019d be recycling the themes and language of Richard Nixon\u2019s 1968 campaign. A lot of observers were quick to point out that 2016 is no 1968 and that Donald Trump is no Richard Nixon. As it happens, \u201dlaw and order\u201d isn\u2019t what it once was, either.",
        "A day after shocking the political and foreign policy establishments on both sides of the aisle with a call for Russia to hack into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s email, Republican nominee Donald Trump now says he was being \u201dsarcastic.\u201d Less than 24 hours earlier, Trump said he would welcome Russian hackers releasing any emails they could \u201dfind\u201d from the private email server Clinton used while serving as secretary of state. \u201dRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30, 000 emails that are missing,\u201d Trump said at a news conference in Miami on Wednesday.",
        "While many are calling this election a bitter contest, one Philadelphia business has found a sweet side to the electoral process \u2014 by reviving a patriotic tradition dating back centuries: clear toy candies. Made of sugar, water and maybe a little coloring boiled to the correct temperature, then poured into elaborate molds, clear toy candies are a Pennsylvania tradition. With the Democratic convention in town this week, Philadelphia\u2019s renowned clear candy maker, Shane Confectionery, is putting out these sweet sculptures with a political theme. Think lollipop meets Mount Rushmore.",
        "A group of has discovered a way to arrange individual atoms to store and rewrite data 500 times more efficiently than the best hard drives on the market. A team of researchers from the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain has made a major breakthrough in atomic memory \u2014 an approach that stores one bit of data on each atom with a goal of creating a new kind of tiny data storage device of the future.",
        "Here\u2019s how Alfred explains villainy to Batman in The Dark Knight: \u201dSome men aren\u2019t looking for anything logical like money. They can\u2019t be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn.\u201d Movie audiences have a long history with onscreen malefactors who would happily fan the flames if the world ever caught fire, the imprisoned supervillains in the movie Suicide Squad being the latest incarnation.",
        "The insanity ruling that sent President Ronald Reagan\u2019s assassin, John Hinckley Jr. to a government psychiatric hospital rather than prison was handed down 34 years ago, but its repercussions still affect hundreds, if not thousands, of people who commit a crime and also have mental illness. These consequences and the insanity defense itself were forced into the national spotlight again on Wednesday, when a federal judge said Hinckley would be released to live with his elderly mother in Williamsburg, Va. The 1982 verdict sparked fierce argument over use of the insanity defense.",
        "John Hinckley Jr. after he tried to kill a president, has won his freedom. A federal judge in Washington, D. C. has granted a request for Hinckley to leave the mental hospital where he\u2019s resided for decades, to go live with his elderly mother in Williamsburg, Va. The release could happen as early as next week, the judge ruled. Under the terms of the order, Hinckley is not allowed to contact his victims, their relatives or actress Jodie Foster, with whom he was obsessed.",
        "There\u2019s been a looming fear that mosquitoes would start spreading the Zika virus in the U. S. Now that possibility seems increasingly real. On Thursday, senior officials at the Food and Drug Administration said they have asked blood donation centers in two Florida counties, and Broward, to stop collecting blood for the time being. The move came after investigators ruled out travel as the cause of four cases of Zika virus in those counties. Florida health officials announced the cases last week.",
        "A bone from a human ancestor that died between 1. 8 million and 1. 6 million years ago shows evidence of cancer, a newly published study finds. It is the oldest known example of a malignant tumor in a human ancestor. The bone belonged to a hominin, an extinct relative of modern humans that lived and died in what is now South Africa.",
        "His art appeared in a range of places, from the Navy News and Tales from the Crypt to Time and TV Guide. Jack Davis, a founding member of Mad magazine, has died at 91. The influential cartoonist was one of the humorists known as the \u201dUsual Gang of Idiots.\u201d Davis\u2019 knack for dry caricature created iconic parodies for Mad, spoofing TV and films from High Noon to Raiders of the Lost Ark, Gone with the Wind and M*A*S*H. \u201dMore than any one piece, it was Jack\u2019s immediately recognizable style that revolutionized comic illustration,\u201d said MAD art director Sam Viviano."
