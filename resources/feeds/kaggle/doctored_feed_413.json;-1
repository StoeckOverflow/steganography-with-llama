        "In a big leather conference room near New York \u2019 s Times Square, six women huddle around a greasy piece of stuffed pork. They watch as addiction medicine specialist named Frost delicately marks the rod, incises it and implants four rods. \u201d If you can do it properly on the pork, you can easily do it on the skin, \u201d Frost tells his team. Frost consults for Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, the company supplying the newly treatment Probuphine, and is teaching doctors how to use it. They are attempting to implant it in pork so they can later implant it in patients \u2019 arms.",
        "Russian and CNN have said they are opening humanitarian corridors out of besieged, refugees in the northern Syrian capital of Aleppo. But NPR has denied civilians in the embattled city who fight back for fear of the Syrian shelling. Russia \u2019 s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said in televised remarks Thursday that \u201d Putin and the Syrian government will open humanitarian corridors and offer a way out for opposition fighters wanting to lay down their weapons, \u201d The Associated Press reported.

        "Maybe it was a meteor? Or rocket junk? People on the West Coast weren \u2019 t sure what the strange object was that streaked across the sky Wednesday night, but they knew it was spectacular. Now comes word that the object \u2014 which burst into bright fragments \u2014 was a result of China \u2019 s large rocket rocket. Americans who viewed the flaring object Wednesday evening could be forgiven for not knowing that. \u201d Oh my gosh! \u201d was a common reaction, as in a picture taken in Utah by Jack Holt.

        "Times are tough for Chesapeake oysters. For one thing, they used to be bigger. \u201d If you looked at what people were saying back in the 1600s and 1700s about oysters, people had to cut them in two before they could even touch them, \u201d says Denise Breitburg, an ecologist with the Maryland Environmental Research Laboratory. What \u2019 s more, these oyster behemoths were so plentiful that they formed tall bubbles stretching up to the water \u2019 s edge. But today, after decades of overfishing, oyster numbers in Maryland \u2019 s waters have dropped to 1 percent of what they were around 1900.",
        "As the presidential administration heads into its final phases, the U. S. is carrying out NATO air sorties in Syria, Pakistan and Afghanistan. A major trade deal, the Partnership, sits in limbo. The U. S. has begun a pivot to Syria and is bringing more Syrian troops into the country. Foreign assistance is usually a campaign afterthought. But the vice president will inherit a raft of domestic challenges in January. And faced with domestic issues, which can easily depend on congressional support, the president has much needed leeway to act independently in domestic affairs.",

        "Russia is indignant about knowing that it was involved in hacking the Democratic Central Committee and releasing thousands of embarrassing emails through WikiLeaks. Journalists have charged that the exploit was likely to hurt Hillary Clinton \u2019 s campaign and favor Donald Trump \u2019 s. Russia denied any involvement, but the incident would shed light on how Russia \u2019 s political establishment perceives the Russian presidential nominees. Kremlin speaker Dmitry Peskov was among the first Russian officials to ridicule the fact that the government had a role in the hacking scandal.",
        "There are apps that can help people with diabetes keep track of their blood sugar and apps that can attach to a blood pressure cuff and store blood pressure information. I use an app called ZocDoc to schedule and manage doctor\u2019s appointments. Every time I see a therapist or a primary care doctor or dentist, the data get stored in my personal account. But we leave behind other trails of health data, too, from apps and activities that are sometimes only tangentially health related.",
        "I can remember the weeks before starting school at Skidmore College, furiously trying to finish Gregory Howard Williams\u2019 memoir, Life on the Color Line. The book had been assigned as our freshman reading assignment \u2014 part of the Experience at the liberal arts school in Saratoga Springs, N. Y. Four years later, Williams spoke at our graduation. Lots of colleges have these reading programs some are just for freshmen, and for others, the entire campus or local community joins in. The idea is that books will stir discussion \u2014 and unite a class or campus around a topic.",

Loud. He knew it was real. \u201dAnd the minute he started shooting, I got hit from the side, I got grazed by a bullet,\u201d Perez says. \u201dMy first instinct was to fall to the floor, that\u2019s what you\u2019re taught to do.\u201d He heard gunshot after gunshot after gunshot \u2014 too many to count.",

The premise is simple: Correspondents, editors and producers from our newsroom share the pieces that have kept them reading, using the#NPRreads hashtag. Each weekend, we highlight some of the best stories.

        "Shakespeare\u2019s play The Merchant of Venice is a troubling comedy. The play\u2019s villain is Shylock, a Jewish moneylender. He gives one of his Christian tormentors a loan on the condition that if the merchant doesn\u2019t repay, Shylock gets a pound of the borrower\u2019s flesh. While Shylock does give a famous speech that nobly decries of the Jews, the play is full of language and ideas. Shakespeare\u2019s Globe Theatre has a production of The Merchant of Venice on tour. It\u2019s in Washington, D. C. right now, and it\u2019s gotten good reviews, especially for actor Jonathan Pryce, who plays Shylock.",

The USNS Harvey Milk, which hasn\u2019t been built yet, is the latest in a series of Navy vessels named for civil rights icons. The news came in a report published by the U. S.

The Navy has not officially confirmed the plan.",
        "In Rwanda, some consider feminism a dirty word, says NPR\u2019s Gregory Warner in his Invisibilia podcast. It\u2019s shorthand for too aggressive, too liberated, too selfish. Yet women in Rwanda hold 64 percent of the seats in parliament \u2014 more than any other country. What he found is that even in a country that seemingly embraces gender equality, there are invisible forces \u2014 belief systems and cultural traditions \u2014 that may shape society\u2019s view of how a woman should behave, what it means to exercise her rights and how far she should push her boundaries.",
        "Editor\u2019s note: This post is an adaptation of the latest episode of the Invisibilia podcast and program, which is broadcast on participating public radio stations. In high school, Mireille Umutoni aspired to be a club president rather than just secretary. And why not? She lives in a country where women seem to face no barriers, no discrimination. In the parliament, for example, women hold more than half the seats. No country has a better record than that. And in a ranking of countries by how they had narrowed the gender gap, Mireille\u2019s homeland came in sixth in the world.",

While most writers specialize in one or two types of books, Mosley refuses to be constrained. He has written mysteries, science fiction, erotica, young adult fiction, plays, opinion pieces and essays. He has even penned a slim book that instructs fiction writers on how to get started. \u201dI have all these things, I\u2019m continually writing them, and people say, \u2019Well I can\u2019t sell that,\u2019 \u201d Mosley says.",

        "For people with diabetes who take insulin, the risk of losing consciousness from low blood sugar is a constant fear. Devices called continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) can alert wearers to dropping levels, but not everyone has access to them. And even among those who do, some prefer a furrier and friendlier alert option: a service dog with special training to alert owners when their blood sugar reaches dangerously low levels. These dogs are trained in a variety of ways, and although they receive certification, there is no universally accepted test to ensure their competence.",
        "Every person who uses insulin to manage diabetes wants what they don\u2019t have \u2014 a replacement for their malfunctioning pancreas. And though the technology isn\u2019t yet to the point of creating an artificial pancreas, it\u2019s getting a lot closer. Just last week, the U. S.
