        "Updated October 29, 2 : 57 pm ET, President Gov. Rick Scott said Friday morning that state officials have ruled out physical and sexual transmission as viable routes of transmission for North Florida people living with Zika virus. \u201d This morning we confirmed that four people in our nation likely have the Zika virus as a result of a mosquito bite. This means Florida has become the first country in our nation to have local control of the Zika virus, \u201d he said at a news conference.",
        "Backers of ColoradoCare \u2014 the state legislative initiative that would establish universal health coverage in Colorado \u2014 think they have the better job for former presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders. With the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia following him, Sanders \u201d comes to Colorado and campaigns for \u2014 and we win, \u201d stated T. R. Reid, one of the architects of ColoradoCare. The initiative sought to provide every region of Colorado with affordable health insurance. Sanders called universal coverage one of the cornerstones of his presidential bid.",
        "Elvis Presley might be best remembered for songs like \u201d Alison \u201d and \u201d Every Day I Write The Story \u201d \u2014 literary pop masterpieces he wrote and recorded either alone or with his longtime band, The Attractions. But in more recent years, Costello has remained a serial collaborator. He \u2019 s produced albums jointly with artists as as pop composer Burt Bacharach, New Orleans Jazz legend Allen Toussaint and, most recently, the pioneering and band The Shadows. So while Costello \u2019 s Newport concert set was billed as a spectacular performance, he was hardly available on Sunday afternoon.",
        "For some people, the attack on police officers by a gunman in Dallas this summer brought to mind another attack by a shooting in Austin 50 years ago \u2014 on Aug. 1, 1966. That \u2019 s when student Dick Whitman stuck his arm over the edge of the clock tower at the University of Texas and started shooting. Ultimately, he shot 16 people \u2014 and wounded more than 30 others. For decades, people have attempted to figure out why. There have been theories about autism, a brain tumor and, of course, mental illness.",
        "Two similar but unrelated shooting incidents took place days apart, police stated, amid the crowded industrial district of Austin, Texas, in the early hours of early morning. The first incident left one man dead and four severely injured. A separate attack ended with the gunman injured when bystanders mistakenly detain the man after he fired his shot during a fight. In a news release, Austin police stated they are \u201d actively looking \u201d for a target they believe to be a man, since they are interviewing multiple suspects in conjunction with an initial shooting that happened at 2 : 17 a. m.",
        "Updated at 6 : 30 p. m. ET with a reaction from Hillary Clinton provided by her lawyer. In one of the most powerful demonstrations at the Democratic National Convention, a Muslim father of a dead U. S. soldier left the stage with his wife beside him and spoke directly to Donald Trump. That father, Khizr Omar, condemned the Republican Presidential nominee for proposing a referendum on Muslims entering the United States. \u201d Let me ask you, have you even read the United States Constitution?",
        "Luke Aikins on foot became the first skydiver to hang from a plane without a suit or wingsuit and live to tell the truth. In a stunt called \u201d Jump Sent, \u201d the daredevil leaped 25, 000 feet to fly \u2014 setting a world record. To accomplish this feat, Aikins had to rotate his body in free fall using only the air currents around him to land flat on the net ( about a third the size of a football field ) straight out to catch him.",
        "The Democratic National Convention is over. Here are some of the big takeaways from a night in Philadelphia that had more suspense and drama than usual. Just like Barack Obama \u2019 s two conventions, this show was flawlessly choreographed. Even the performances of the Bernie Bros had a perfect ending. The speakers, the crowd, and even the entertainment were all designed to drive the message of optimism and success, hour after hour, day after day. The Democrats probably had a lot more \u201d showbiz \u201d than Donald Trump promised but might not have always delivered. The pacing was quite effective.",
        "As tens of thousands of politicians, party representatives and protesters swept through the neighborhood of Brotherly Love this week for the Democratic National Convention, dozens of homeless Philadelphians and pitched tents on a grassy lot. They were part of a protest over the four months of the convention organized by Cheri Honkala, a worker with the Poor People \u2019 s Association Human Rights group.",
        "Bad Moms is a series about good moms who try to get bad. Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis and Kathryn Hahn play suburban Chicago mothers who find themselves ground down by the relentless cycle of school and basketball games, supermarket sales, errands, chores and endless worries. Every night they wind up at the same time after a PTA meeting and together they refuse to let loose.",
        "Adam Summers used to trade Snickers glasses to get free eye scans of dead fish. He liked fish. A lot. Summers is a professor at the University of Georgia in the biology department and head of Aquatic and Fisheries Sciences. \u201d I \u2019 ve never been a fish guy, \u201d he says. \u201d It \u2019 s just been in my blood since I was as little as I can remember. \u201d Summers was a video consultant on Finding Nemo and did extensive work with Finding Dory.",
        "Jason Bourne is back, though it would seem like he really went away. The novel created by author James Ludlum has populated 12 novels, a movie, and now five adventures. In three of the five Bourne films, the music underlying the game has been the work of British composer John Powell. Like the protagonist he helps propel, Jason has faced some challenges. His first feature film role was the 1997 action movie. He followed that with more action, including The Italian Job and Mr. E. Smith.",
        "\u201dIf you want to go fast, go alone but if you want to go far, go together.\u201d That was one piece of advice passed along at the Democratic National Convention. The words were spoken by New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who said he was quoting \u201dan African saying.\u201d The proverb got a lot of retweets. And some criticism. One Twitter user, Christiana A. Mbakwe, said, \u201dIf someone starts an aphorism with \u2019there\u2019s an African saying\u2019 it\u2019s probably a mythical quote misattributed to a whole continent.\u201d That wasn\u2019t the only purportedly African proverb uttered at the DNC.",
        "Two big subjects popped out from the screen on this week\u2019s Sunday political talk shows: the candidates\u2019 responses to criticism leveled by grieving families, and questions about Russia\u2019s involvement in the U. S. presidential race. Khizr Khan, whose son was killed fighting for the U. S. in Iraq, spoke forcefully at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday, accusing Donald Trump of fomenting divisiveness and asking if Trump had read the Constitution.",
        "The Australian Olympic team has had a difficult week. First, upon arrival at the Olympic Village, delegation head Kitty Chiller said their allotted building was not \u201dsafe or ready\u201d to receive the athletes. Then, after quick efforts to get the building ready, the athletes moved in \u2014 only to have a fire break out two days later. It has now emerged that clothing and at least one laptop were stolen from the team during the fire evacuation. The fire broke out on Friday evening in the building\u2019s underground parking lot, according to a statement from the team.",
        "It may be cloudy and cold, with stones rather than sand underfoot, but the English seaside could get an unexpected boost this summer \u2014 courtesy of the Brexit. Britain\u2019s June vote to leave the European Union has depressed the value of the British pound, and is likely to make Britons\u2019 airline tickets more expensive for summer vacations. So many are opting for \u201dstaycations\u201d instead. \u201dIn my circle of friends, I suspect many people will stay in the U. K. as opposed to going abroad,\u201d says Matthew Kirk, 42, who works in IT in London.",
        "A few years ago, on a hot August day in Lucknow, India, my mother and father were crossing the street when an auto rickshaw \u2014 a motorized vehicle \u2014 hit her with such force that she slammed into a road median several feet away. The driver left the scene as soon as he had hit her. My father didn\u2019t think of reporting the matter to the police it would have been a hassle, he thought. Indians believe that the police are usually corrupt and a waste of time.",
        "There\u2019s a popular refrain among National Park Service employees, one that doubles as a reminder, of sorts, after a long, wearisome day: \u201dWe get paid in sunrises and sunsets.\u201d For many park employees, the pay is seasonal and not great. The hours are long. The question is usually the same (\u201dWhere\u2019s the bathroom? \u201d). And no matter how many pamphlets you pass out, instructions you give or \u201dAttention!\u201d signs you put up, people still wander off trails, carve their names in trees and get too close to the bears.",
        "Seoul is the home of Korean pop music, or which is quickly becoming one of Korea\u2019s biggest exports. It\u2019s a multibillion dollar industry that, for the last decade, has been dominated by girl groups. Management agencies churn out groups that look alike and embody a girlish, innocence. But critics say there\u2019s a dark side to the bubblegum images being spread around the world. The industry is especially hard on Korean women. Park Boram, considered a classic success story, is in many ways a poster child for the ideal.",
        "It\u2019s pushing 100 degrees outside and the Southern California sun is baking the fields of shattered clay at the Redlands Shooting Range \u2014 but it\u2019s a training day for Kim Rhode, so she shoulders her shotgun, dumps a few boxes of shells into her pockets and heads out to the skeet field. When you\u2019re this close to the Olympic Games, every day is a training day \u2014 even if it\u2019s an old, familiar drill. Rhode has a shot at history this summer in Rio. \u201dNo pressure,\u201d she says.",
        "Your time is valuable. I know that. There are roughly a billion books published every year and you\u2019ve only got time to read a few of them. There are important books and acclaimed books and books you can put down like junk food \u2014 like sitting on the couch in your underwear and eating that whole bag of barbecue potato chips because there\u2019s no one there to tell you not to. You have to make some choices.",
        "Perhaps you\u2019ve heard the famous F. Scott Fitzgerald quote that goes, \u201dThere are no second acts in American lives.\u201d Some may beg to disagree. After all, for many people, there are indeed second acts. One such example is singer and actress Heather Headley, who epitomizes this in ways few others do. Headley is a native of the republic Trinidad and Tobago in the South Caribbean, where she started singing and playing the piano in church at a very young age. She moved with her family to the United States in the early \u201990s. In the U. S.",
        "Hillary Clinton can consider her convention a modest success. Gallup reported this week that 45 percent of Americans said they were more likely to vote for her, compared to 41 percent who said less likely. Historically, that\u2019s not a terribly impressive number. But if you compare that to Donald Trump\u2019s convention, Clinton and her friends in Philadelphia last week did phenomenally well. Just 36 percent of Americans said the Republican convention made them more likely to vote for Trump, compared to 51 percent who said less likely.",
        "New York City Police Commissioner William J. Bratton announced that he plans to step down next month, probably marking an end to a career in public service. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Chief of Department James O\u2019Neill, a commander who began his work as a transit officer in 1983, will take over as commissioner. Bratton, 68, acknowledged that now is a \u201dchallenging time\u201d for policing, but he said things were headed in the right direction.",
        "Pope Francis has created a commission to study whether women could serve as deacons within the Roman Catholic Church. News. va, the official news network for the Vatican, announced the commission of seven men and six women on its website: \u201dAfter intense prayer and mature reflection, Pope Francis has decided to institute the Commission for the Study of the Diaconate of Women. As president of the Commission, Pope Francis has appointed Archbishop Luis Francisco Ladaria Ferrer, SJ.",
        "McDonald\u2019s is no longer serving chicken raised on antibiotics that are important to human medicine. The company made the pledge last year, and now reports that it has completed its transition to the new antibiotic policy ahead of schedule. As we\u2019ve reported, many scientists are concerned that the more an antibiotic is given to food animals, the more quickly bacteria could adapt and become resistant to it. And the FDA has urged farmers and ranchers who raise livestock to reduce antibiotic use. Chicken served at McDonald\u2019s won\u2019t necessarily be raised completely without antibiotics.",
        "First the Russian track and field team was barred. Then most of the Russian rowing squad was told to stay home. Now the Russian weightlifters are all out. The International Olympic Committee decided on July 24 not to ban the entire Russian team, consisting of nearly 400 athletes, from the Summer Games that open Friday in Rio de Janeiro. But the IOC did tell the various sporting federations to take a close look at the Russians, and as they\u2019ve done that, the number of ineligible Russians kept rising.",
        "A pair of scientists have a new hypothesis about why the female orgasm exists: It might have something to do with releasing an egg to be fertilized. Scientists have puzzled over, and sometimes even questioned the existence of, a phenomenon that appears to have no physical effect on conception. While a male orgasm is crucial to impregnate a female, it is not obvious how a female orgasm affects whether she is impregnated. In fact, Aristotle and Hippocrates both pointed out the female orgasm appears to be an afterthought, at least when it comes to creating offspring.",
        "Joshua trees are weird. They\u2019ve got shaggy bark, twisted branches and leaves. \u201dIt\u2019s something that you don\u2019t even imagine could live on Earth and here it is,\u201d says Cameron Barrows, standing right beneath one. \u201dIt\u2019s something very alien.\u201d They stretch across the dusty valley of Joshua Tree National Park. \u201dIt\u2019s like a Dr. Seuss book,\u201d Barrows says. If these are Dr. Seuss trees, then Barrows is the Lorax \u2014 speaking for the trees. Barrows, an ecologist at the University of and his research team are trying to find out what will happen to Joshua trees in the future.",
        "Apple is replacing its black pistol emoji with a green water gun icon. It\u2019s one of more than a hundred new and redesigned emojis that will be available on iPhones and iPads this fall, when the company releases its latest operating system. The other new emojis include many icons depicting women and people of color. There are women of all apparent cartoon ethnicities surfing, running, swimming, playing basketball and weightlifting. There is also a new icon of a pride flag as well as depictions of families with only one parent. The pistol emoji has caused trouble in recent years."
