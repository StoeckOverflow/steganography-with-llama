        "After a hot air balloon crash in Peru on Saturday killed all 16 passengers aboard, revelations about the pilot \u2019 s past are raising questions about the status of balloon operators. The pilot had drunken driving and attempted convictions that would likely have blocked him from getting an airline pilot \u2019 s license, The Associated Press reports \u2014 but there are already stringent licensing requirements for balloon pilots. The crash was the deadliest not just in U. S. history, but in the entire northern hemisphere, one witness tells Reuters.",
        "Hop growers are giving a glass to craft brewers. The demand for brews has helped growers boost their profits, expand their operations, and, in some instances, save their farms. \u201d Without the advent of craft beers, a few large, corporate growers may be supplying all of the hops and local, corporations like ours would have gone bankrupt, \u201d says Jim Gooding, vice president of research at Gooding Farms, a hop grower in Wilder, Nebraska.",
        "Having the two parts of a duo switch sides halfway through a set might qualify as unexpected. But with brothers Bruce and Ben Hopkins \u2014 the two members of the famous PWR BTTM \u2014 you come to expect the strange or, if not the unexpected, a kind of serious impropriety when faced with norms.",
        "How should schools better prepare kids to learn and work in the second decade of the 21st century? In previous eras, the aim of school was simple : Teach them math and reading skills. Have them know some basic facts about the environment. Today the challenge is a little different. Most people all over the globe, even in the poorest countries, have much easier access to a calculator, a library and great swaths of knowledge in their brains. And technology isn \u2019 t just expanding access to knowledge. It \u2019 s also redefining people.",
        "It \u2019 s official. The Zika outbreak has established a toehold in Florida. Since people likely found Zika in a neighborhood north of South Miami, health experts said Monday. That summer mosquitoes in that area have picked up the virus and are spreading it. Zika can cause permanent birth defects if a woman is infected at anytime during summer. So the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is doing something it has never done before : issuing a special advisory to a part of the mainland U. S. because of an outbreak of an unidentified disease.",
        "Now that the political parties are over, it \u2019 s time to start worrying about the transition to the next generation. Yes, really. As of Aug. 1, the federal government is providing office space away to representatives of the Clinton and Reagan campaigns to start making plans for taking over in March. If this seems a bit suspicious, those who have been there say it \u2019 s not. \u201d This is the most complicated thing, not only on the planet, but in history, \u201d thought Max Stier, president of the Council For Public Service.",
        "Gaudy beauty and extravagant beauty twine around each other, as elegant as their exotic \u2019 sinuous hair and garments, in the dark comic Monstress. Its lavish visuals, modern world building and deft technique will doubtless land it on many \u201d Best of \u201d lists for 2016. But writer Richard Liu \u2019 s nervy, idiosyncratic characterizations are what really tear this story apart. Overall, though, there are those lavish visuals. Composer Sana Takeda has mined contemporary fashion, traditional Japanese and American design, ancient European art and Western art nouveau \u2014 plus a fertile mix of steampunk \u2014 for iconography and style.",
        "San Diego is over. Nerds from all around the world have cut up their costumes, wiped off their feet and left the city. Many of them will bring home more than just collectibles and art. They \u2019 ll also bring home memories of meeting their favorite artists and writers. Wanda Liu is one of those artists she wrote the epic manga comic book Monstress with fellow artist, Sana Takeda. Throughout the year, fans flocked to their booth to thank Liu and have her sign their cover of the book.",
        "Khizr Khan, whose speech at the Democratic National Convention about his slain colleague has garnered admiration from Democrats and some Republicans, but ire from Donald Trump, says the candidate needs to have \u201d patience and tolerance for others. \u201d \u201d Him and I have [ the ] same equal rights. In his speeches, he thinks that he can criticize people but no one else can criticize, \u201d Khan told PBS NewsHour host Robert Woodruff. \u201d That is not the value of this country. \u201d Trump had criticized Khan \u2019 s remarks and subsequent TV show via Twitter, but Khan followed up saying that \u201d story is not about Mr.",
        "Two months ago, in the midst of debate over the fact his wife, Melania, had plagiarized half of her convention speech from President Obama, Donald Trump tweeted that \u201d all press is good press. \u201d That seems to be the mindset the Republican gubernatorial nominee was embracing Monday morning as he continued to pick a confrontation with Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the parents of an Army captain killed in Iraq. Khizr Khan delivered a similar speech criticizing Obama at last week \u2019 s Republican National Convention. Obama \u2019 s sustained hostility toward the Khans has made other Republican nominees and officeholders deeply uncomfortable.",
        "In an implicit rebuke of Donald Trump, President Obama thanked the nation \u2019 s Gold Star families, saying those who \u2019 ve helped loved ones in government service are \u201d a powerful reminder of the true strength of society. \u201d \u201d No one has given more for our defense and our security than our Gold Star families, \u201d Obama told Monday, in a speech to the Disabled Vietnam Veterans in Atlanta. \u201d Our Silver Star families have made a sacrifice that most of us might even begin to make. \u201d The president was implicitly aligning himself with the parents of Humayun Abdullah, a U.

When Mayer came on board four years ago, Yahoo was in a tense, moment. It needed a new leader. But in interviews with Mayer and people who worked with her, a new truth emerges : The board treated Yahoo more like a think tank than a cruise ship.

        "A drive southwest of Madrid, I pull into a tiny town square filled with songbirds and an outsized Catholic church \u2014 where Eduardo Sousa and Diego Labourdette are waiting. They\u2019re an odd couple. Sousa is a jovial Spanish farmer. Labourdette is a academic \u2014 an ecologist and migratory bird expert \u2014 who teaches at a university in Madrid. But they\u2019re in business together \u2014 in the foie gras business.

        "The recent hacking of Democratic Party databases \u2014 and strong suspicions that the Russian government is involved \u2014 have led to new fears that America\u2019s voting systems are vulnerable to attack and that an outsider could try to disrupt the upcoming elections. A cyberattack on U. S. elections isn\u2019t as as you might think. Just a week and a half ago, Illinois election officials shut down that state\u2019s voter registration database after discovering it had been hacked.",
        "What do Kyrgyzstan, Vietnam, Albania, Germany and Ethiopia have in common? Turns out all five countries do better than average when it comes to turning their national wealth into a better life for their citizens. There\u2019s also a list of countries that do worse than average. Spoiler alert: The United States is one of them. This unusual gauge of national success is the brainchild of analysts at the Boston Consulting Group.",
        "What would Ivanka Trump do if she were sexually harassed on the job? GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump says she would quit. \u201dI would like to think she would find another career or find another company if that was the case,\u201d Donald Trump told Kirsten Powers in a USA Today column published Monday. On \u201dCBS This Morning,\u201d Charlie Rose asked Trump\u2019s son Eric about his dad\u2019s sexual harassment comments.

        "President Obama reiterated that he believes Donald Trump is \u201dunfit\u201d to be president, issuing a sharp rebuke of the Republican nominee from the White House East Room on Tuesday. \u201dYes, I think the Republican nominee is unfit to serve as president,\u201d Obama said in response to a question from a reporter during a news conference with Lee Hsien Loong, the prime minister of Singapore.",
        "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has a history of barring people from his campaign events. He\u2019s banned reporters from the Washington Post and protesters are routinely escorted out. And now a baby joins their ranks outside the perimeters. At a rally Tuesday in Northern Virginia, Trump asked that a woman with a crying baby \u201dget that baby out of here.\u201d At first, the GOP nominee didn\u2019t seem to mind the infant. When its cry interrupted his remarks, he said, \u201dDon\u2019t worry about that baby. I love babies.\u201d He went on: \u201dI love babies.",
        "Flossing has quietly lost its place among recommendations for daily health, at least as prescribed in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which are issued every five years by the U. S. departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture. That could be because there\u2019s scant evidence that flossing does much to keep teeth and gums healthy. \u201dIn large epidemiological studies, the evidence for flossing turns out to be fairly weak,\u201d says Tim Iafolla, a dentist with the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, which is part of the National Institutes of Health.",
        "In a move that could be interpreted as indulgent or prescient \u2014 or both \u2014 the U. S. men\u2019s basketball team at the Rio Olympics will stay aboard a luxury cruise ship rather than the spartan facilities at the athletes village. It appears the U. S. women will also be living aboard the Silver Cloud, according to media reports.

        "Turkey abolished capital punishment in 2004. But in the wake of last month\u2019s failed coup, Turks have been demanding it be reinstated for the coup plotters. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has encouraged parliament to consider such a move, saying the public will cannot be ignored. Legal experts say applying a death sentence retroactively is problematic.

        "Jesmyn Ward was in her 20s when she first read James Baldwin\u2019s 1963 essay collection The Fire Next Time.

        "Editor\u2019s note: As you\u2019ll see right away, this column includes a word that is offensive to many. Ask star and Issa Rae about the many times the word \u201dnigga\u201d surfaces in her new HBO comedy Insecure \u2014 a wonderfully unassuming comedy about the life of a young black woman in Los Angeles \u2014 and she\u2019s got a simple answer.

        "Comedian Ali Wong is so committed to her work that she estimates that she performed on stage almost every day for 11 years before her daughter was born.

        "The Delaware Supreme Court has decided that the state\u2019s death penalty law violates the Sixth Amendment. The court was responding to a U. S. Supreme Court decision from a case in January \u2014 Hurst v. Florida \u2014 that found that Florida\u2019s death penalty law violated the Constitution because it gave judges \u2014 not juries \u2014 ultimate power to impose the death penalty.

        "The Transportation Safety Administration is reminding Batman enthusiasts to check their superhero weapons when they fly. According to the TSA, people keep trying to carry \u201dbatarangs\u201d \u2014 the sharp, metal, weapons that Batman throws at his enemies \u2014 onto planes, only to have them confiscated at airport security checkpoints.

        "For many minorities, what happens in the community stays in the community. But last winter, 17 Indian women from a tiny sect of Islam blew the lid off a guarded secret, spurring scrutiny, controversy, debate and vituperative abuse. Since then, online and off, they\u2019ve been called sexually promiscuous, and traitors to their faith. Their crime? They authored a petition asking the government of India to outlaw female circumcision. Until the petition went public in December, many Indians didn\u2019t know female genital mutilation \u2014 or FGM \u2014 happens in the country at all.",
        "Publishing is a notoriously risky business. A publishing house might give a author a deal, only to see the book flop. It\u2019s always been hard to predict what will sell. Now publishers are getting some help from data that tells them how readers read \u2014 and that makes some people nervous. Alan Rinzler has a long history in publishing.

But not only is the mollusk\u2019s mighty comeback good for consumers and fishermen \u2014 it\u2019s also good for waterways. Jimmy Parks, longtime chef and owner of the Butcher Station in Winchester, Va. says the way we eat oysters has changed in the past decade. \u201dAs much food as possibly can go on my plate at the least amount of money I can spend used to be the way things were,\u201d says Parks."
