        "Now here \u2019 s a political situation you might not expect. Hillary Clinton is the candidate who picked up a private email message and was \u2014 in the words of the director of the organization \u2014 \u201d extremely careless \u201d in how she handled sensitive information. And her campaign and the Democratic Party just got hacked. Today, prominent leaders in the cybersecurity movement are coming out in favor of Clinton for president. The scene is one you just can \u2019 t make up. It \u2019 s a Hillary Clinton fundraiser at a Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas.",
        "Happily, the creators behind the 1980s comic series Suicide Squad have been getting a tremendous amount of attention with the success of the splashy new movie it has released. Writer John Ostrander named the comic ( with artist David McDonnell ) and Ostrander \u2019 s late sister, Kimberly Yale, it for much of its run. But in all the coverage of the media, Yale has been completely forgotten. Back in 1987, when Suicide Squad launched, very few women produced comics for Marvel or DC, the two big picture publishers.",
        "Many new studies involving children never end up being put to use because scientists sometimes don \u2019 t publish the results of their studies, according to an analysis published online Thursday. The surveys raise both scientific and ethical issues regarding impact on this vulnerable population. Many studies have documented that about a tenth of all clinical trials undertaken in the United States end up as largely wasted resources, because the scientists doing that work don \u2019 t take the effort to publish and reproduce their results with the scientific consensus.",
        "American athletics were not exactly a powerhouse at the 1972 Summer Olympics : They won just 23 medals, compared with 71 for the U. S. men. The women were far from the medal podium in football. They didn \u2019 t win a single gold in track and field, winning just one silver and three bronze. But something important happened that year. The U. S. Congress passed Article IX, which bars gender discrimination in education programs receiving federal funding. Sports wasn \u2019 t the focus of Section IX. In fact, exactly the opposite.",
        "Let \u2019 s take a step back from the news of the past few days and address a fundamental question : Why does Trump suddenly seem possible? Donald Trump, the unsinkable man who seemed immune to political consequences while winning Republican presidential primaries month after month, now finds himself with an ailing campaign and a strong case of personal guilt. Cable TV and other major media are obsessed with fallout surrounding Team Trump and dissension in the Democratic Party.",
        "On the final night of the Republican National Convention last month, as Donald Trump formally announced his party \u2019 s nomination for president, my Code Switch Shereen Marisol Meraji fired off a tweet about how unnerved she was watching Trump \u2019 s address, with its graphic denunciations of Muslims and Mexican immigrants. \u201d This speech is difficult to listen to as a Latina and an Iranian, \u201d she wrote. \u201d So far. \u201d Another NPR ad \u2014 a person of color, and a transgender \u2014 quickly texted her and warned her the tweet might be inappropriate,. Shereen saw it, and took her tweet down.",
        "The public defense office in Missouri thinks it \u2019 s been overloaded for years : too many clients, too few attorneys, too little money. But Gov. Jay Nixon, who was previously the state \u2019 s attorney general, has vetoed potential caseload caps and also blocked funding. The chief of the public defender system is frustrated \u2014 so frustrated he \u2019 s refused a state provision permitting him to draft any lawyer in order to take over a case. And he has another lawyer in mind : Jay Nixon.",
        "Connie Smith of Columbus, Ohio, got some unsettling news after her son \u2019 s checkup. A doctor called to say that the \u2019 s blood lead level reading had come back as well elevated, which would rank him in the top 2. 5 percent of kids ages 1 to 5 in the United States. That was alarming, because according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, unusually low blood lead levels can have effects on a patient \u2019 s IQ, academic achievement and inability to pay attention. Additionally, the reading was a false start.",
        "We will get straight to the news in a minute. But remember, a public service email from the Philadelphia mayor \u2019 s office regarding dumpster pools. It came from Karen Guss, communications secretary for the Department of Licenses and Inspections, who told The that it was \u201d just another day for us \u201d : \u201d In defense of the City \u2019 s commitment to good health, safety and public common sense, we will not renew permits for block party dumpster pools. And while you would imagine this decision would not yield an explanation, three hours of press requests have indicated otherwise.",
        "The federal government announced plans also to lift a moratorium on funding of several controversial experiments that used human stem cells to create animal embryos that are partly human. The National Institutes of Health is proposing a new policy to permit researchers to get federal funding to make embryos, known as chimeras, under certain carefully monitored control. The NIH imposed a moratorium on funding these studies in September because they could cause ethical concerns.",
        "Olympic athletes, prepare to watch hookers in a scrum who decide not to end up in the sin bin. The lexicon of rugby, and the men \u2019 s language itself, return to Olympic levels after a absence. The return in football also involves a number of debuts : It \u2019 s the first Olympic tournament for women in the sport, and a first for Rugby Sevens. It \u2019 s a game. International rugby has 13 or 15 a side. Sevens is a violent, physical and unpredictable event.",
        "One day ago \u2014 on Aug. 5, 2015 \u2014 an environmental crew at the Gold Star Mine in southwest Wyoming accidentally unleashed 3 million gallons of orange water laced with mercury and arsenic. The toxic waters flowed into the Animas River, ultimately running into New Mexico \u2019 s San Juan Dam and into Lake Powell. So far, disaster response and air quality monitoring have cost the EPA about $ 29 million \u2014 and the process isn \u2019 t over yet. Water filled with heavy metals began to gush out of the mine, says Joyel Dhieux of the Environmental Protection Agency.",

It \u2019 s a slam, thank you very much. The word \u201d slam \u201d makes a promise that you \u2019 d think a couple of folks twirling a hockey puck on a stick could never make.

        "Wednesday night, the BBC documentary Koko: The Gorilla Who Talks premiered on U. S. TV. The program tells the story of how Koko, age 44, one of two gorillas living at The Gorilla Foundation in Woodside, Calif. began to learn as an infant to communicate with humans through use of American Sign Language (ASL). She went on to become the most famous gorilla in the world. The power of this film \u2014 and indeed of Koko\u2019s entire life \u2014 is its convincing demonstration of how reflective gorillas are, and how profoundly they may feel emotions.",
        "You sneak them into backpacks and let them commingle with the video games (hoping some of the latter\u2019s appeal will rub off). You lay them around the kids\u2019 beds like stepping stones through the Slough of Despond and, for good measure, Vitamix them to an imperceptible pulp for the occasional smoothie. Books are everywhere in your house, and yet . .. they\u2019re not being consumed. Because it\u2019s summer, and kids have so many other things they\u2019d rather do.",
        "Note: NPR\u2019s First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the Spotify playlist at the bottom of the page. It\u2019s taken Blind Pilot five years to release a to 2011\u2019s We Are The Tide, and the result befits a group that moves at its own pace: And Then Like Lions unfurls slowly and gracefully, its energy directed more toward richness of sound than speed or force. The Portland, Ore. band makes wistful music \u2014 songs of reflection and connection, carried out in a subtle swirl of strings, horns, pianos and voices.",
        "Last week, we asked a question: What does it mean to be a \u201dfeminist\u201d in your country? How do your belief systems and cultural traditions shape your view of how a woman should exercise her rights? Goats and Soda received hundreds of replies with the hashtag #FeminismInMyCountry. Men and women from Portugal to Tanzania not only answered our question but offered their view of how girls and women still suffer from discrimination, prejudice and stereotyping.",
        "At the Democratic National Convention last week, President Obama gave Hillary Clinton props for being a super tough rival during the 2008 Democratic primary. \u201dShe was doing everything I was doing,\u201d he said, \u201dbut just like Ginger Rogers, it was backwards in heels.\u201d Now, it\u2019s always great to hear the leader of the free world acknowledge the unlevel playing field . ..",
        "We were alarmed to learn yesterday that hurricanes with female names are not being taken as seriously as their male counterparts. It seems people in the path of a hurricane are more likely to heed warnings to take shelter or evacuate if the storm is named Charley than if the storm is named Eloise. Which can be a deadly decision. [Because, seriously: Hurricanes are dangerous \u2014 even if they have \u201dlady\u201d names. If authorities tell you to take shelter or evacuate, do it.",
        "Russia is fighting a mysterious anthrax outbreak in a remote corner of Siberia. Dozens of people have been hospitalized one child has died. The government airlifted some families out because more than 2, 000 reindeer have been infected. Officials don\u2019t know exactly how the outbreak started, but the current hypothesis is almost unbelievable: A heat wave has thawed the frozen soil there and with it, a reindeer carcass infected with anthrax decades ago. Some scientists think this incident could be an example of what climate change may increasingly surface in the tundra.",
        "Rio is welcoming the world to the Summer Olympics \u2014 and after months of negative news and setbacks, organizers for these games on Friday finally got to do what the city\u2019s famous for: Throw a party, in the form of an opening ceremony.

Brazil\u2019s \u201dMarvelous City\u201d (Cidade Maravilhosa) as the locals call it, is rightly celebrated for beautiful beaches (and the beautiful people on those beaches) raucous Carnival and the spectacular view atop Corcovado Mountain.

        "As the world turns its eyes toward Rio in preparation for the 2016 Olympic Games, people everywhere are immersing themselves in Brazil\u2019s cultural offerings \u2014 food, art, music, and, of course, literature. For decades, readers have taken to the poetry and fiction of Machado de Assis and Jorge Amado and the stories of experimental giants like Clarice Lispector and Hilda Hilst.

        "Two of Brazil\u2019s greatest strengths \u2014 its dazzling culture and its flair for spectacle \u2014 will power the Opening Ceremony of the Summer Olympics on Friday night. Organizers will unleash samba drums, singers and dancers in a show designed to thrill a global audience and silence the criticism surrounding the preparations. To pull it off, producers had to figure out how to move thousands of athletes and hundreds of performers in and out of a stadium whose field presents a unique problem.

        "Buried below the ice sheet that covers most of Greenland, there\u2019s an abandoned U. S. Army base. Camp Century had trucks, tunnels, even a nuclear reactor. Advertised as a research station, it was also a test site for deploying nuclear missiles. The camp was abandoned almost 50 years ago, completely buried below the surface. But serious pollutants were left behind. Now a team of scientists says that as climate warming melts the ice sheet, those pollutants could spread. When the U. S.",
        "Scientists have answered a burning question central to the charm of sunflowers: Why do young flowers move their blooms to always face the sun over the course of a day? And then: Once sunflowers reach maturity, why do they stop tracking the sun and only face east? In a article in Science, the researchers say the young plant\u2019s (also called heliotropism) can be explained by circadian rhythms \u2014 the behavioral changes tied to an internal clock that humans also have, which follow a roughly 24 hour cycle.",
        "Addressing a joint convention of black and Hispanic journalists Friday, Hillary Clinton found herself wading through a QA session \u2014 a format that has become a rarity for her.

        "There is an old stereotype about women in politics, one that was articulated by a man named Mark Rudolph back in 2008 on the Fox News Channel in an interview with Bill O\u2019Reilly. \u201dYou get a woman in the oval office, the most powerful person in the world, what\u2019s the downside?\u201d O\u2019Reilly asked. Rudolph\u2019s answer: \u201dYou mean beside the PMS and the mood swings, right?\u201d Moments later he said he was joking. But for women in politics, questions or jokes about temperament are familiar.",
