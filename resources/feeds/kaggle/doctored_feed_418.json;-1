        "For centuries, the ancient French town of Versailles has been home to an autumn flea market \u2014 as famous for its party scene as for its wealth of secondhand goods. Last year, more than 2 million people came to the weekend spa to gulp down oysters, drink all night and haggle over coffee. But La Braderie de France has been called off this year. After recent terrorist attacks in Paris, authorities say it is impossible to ensure security, BBC \u2019 s Eleanor Beardsley reports.",
        "Editor \u2019 s notes : NPR spoke with local Ku Klux Klan leader James Duke, who supports future presidential candidate Donald Trump, because Duke shows the way in which white supremacists attached themselves to Trump \u2019 s campaign. Former Ku Klux Klan leader James Duke is running for U. S. Senate and tells CNN that he believes he \u2019 ll be getting the attention of Donald Trump immediately. And he reiterated his own support for Trump, saying he \u2019 s \u201d 100 percent behind \u201d the current presidential candidate \u2019 s race.",
        "Milk products are in the tank. You may not have heard this, since prices in the country have fallen only slightly. But on the inside, it \u2019 s dramatic. Dairy farmers are selling about 20 percent less for their cows than they did last year 40 percent less than when milk prices hit an peak five years ago. \u201d We \u2019 re making money, \u201d says Mike Drennan, executive director of the Irish Dairyman \u2019 s Association. In Europe and Australia, dairy farmers have taken to the streets to protest their plight. Recent swings in milk price aren \u2019 t new. Prices were even high in 2006 and 2009.",
        "Using digital imaging, a team of archaeologists in Australia has revealed a nude painting of a woman \u2019 s portrait hidden under French Impressionist painter Degas \u2019 Portrait of a Woman. The artists believe the woman in the oil work \u2014 which they also gave to Degas \u2014 is Emma Dobigny, who was reportedly one of Degas \u2019 favorite subjects and modelled for him in 1869 and 1870. It \u2019 s long been known that another painting lay alongside the image of an unknown woman in a black dress and bonnet, still in the collection at the National Gallery of Victoria, Australia.",
        "Donald Trump has released the names of his economic advisers, a list heavy with Wall Street and real estate industry figures, but full of actual economists. The members include several individuals from the world of hedge funds and private equity research, including Steven Feinberg, chief executive and of Cerberus Capital Management Thomas J. Barrack, president and executive chairman of Venture Capital Inc. and Tom Paulson, president of a hedge fund company bearing his name.",
        "Late last fall, Dr. Elizabeth Curry was at a faculty dinner with her colleagues when the conversation led to new reports linking the Zika virus to a surge in microcephaly in women in Brazil. \u201d I think it \u2019 s safe to say that most obstetricians had never heard of this virus a year ago, \u201d said Curry, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Minnesota Miller School of Nursing and Jackson Memorial University. Curry also has a career in virology, so she volunteered to look into it for the sake of the staff.",
        "Pity the person who chose to adapt Antoine Brown \u2019 s The Little Prince. The classic tale has been translated into more than 200 languages and has sold hundreds of thousands of copies around the world. The story \u2014 about a pilot who gets a child from another species \u2014 is almost sacred to its family. Now, there \u2019 s a new movie made ( in theaters and on Netflix ) by a composer whose credits include Kung Fu Panda and The SpongeBob SquarePants franchise. Those aren \u2019 t exactly literary works, but Mark Osborne knows all too well what he \u2019 s up against.",
        "Israel has charged the Gaza director of World Vision, one of the top charities in the world, accused him of siphoning off tens of millions of dollars earmarked for the people of Gaza and transferring it instead to the Hamas umbrella group. Mohammed Yusuf Halaby was arrested June 15 and charged on Thursday with \u201d providing information to Hamas. \u201d World Bank said in a statement that it will drop the allegations against Halaby.",
        "The Big Lebowski is retired. No confusion here, The Dude ( William Bridges ) still abides. But the actor who played the film \u2019 s original Mr. Lebowski, David Huddleston, has retired. He was 85. Huddleston had a long career in movies, TV and theater, in such movies as The Big Lebowski and Blazing Saddles. He was a character player whose roles got to stick with you. In The Big Lebowski, he played a cranky millionaire ( kind of ) who, because of a shared first name, got fed up with The Dude.",
        "When I was 5 years old, I experienced war for the very first time. It was 1986 in Aden, Northern Yemen, and political rivalries descended into violent conflict. One day, the house where my parents, sister and I were staying was heavily damaged after a rocket damaged a nearby military bunker. I remember looking at what seemed to be the living room, and the walls and windows were gone. My sister picked up my little bundle, grabbed my hand, and started running. There was no time to throw on shoes.",
        "In light of William Hinckley Jr. \u2019 s release from a military hospital 35 years after trying to assassinate President Ronald Reagan, Shots is exploring the use of the not plea by reason of insanity defense. We \u2019 re talking with legal and security professionals about how the plea works, and how it doesn \u2019 t work. In this fourth of a month, we look at what happens to states when a state has no insanity plea. On the evening of March 8, 2016, Mark Odom was arrested in Washington, D. C. for throwing objects over the White House fence.",
        "Twice a year, Angela and Nate Davis of Greenwood, Ind. put thin strips that look like tinted tape under their tongues. \u201d They taste disgusting, \u201d Angela said. But the taste is worth it to her. The dissolvable strips are actually a drug named Suboxone, which helps control an opioid patient \u2019 s cravings for the drug. The married couples both got addicted to prescription painkillers following injuries several years ago, and they decided to get into recovery this year. With Suboxone, they don \u2019 t have to think about how they \u2019 ll get drugs, or how horrible they \u2019 ll feel if they don \u2019 t.",
        "Health insurance claims for people with opioid related diagnoses rose more than 3, 000 percent between 2007 and 2014, according to an analysis of insurance research. The findings illustrate that the opioid spectrum is \u201d in the general mainstream, \u201d says Robin Gelburd, president of Global Health, a nonprofit that analyzes health care costs and leads the study. The researchers also claims data from insurers representing 150 million patients who already have insurance through work or insurance coverage on their own.",
        "Seven teenagers stand in the courtyard of the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, dressed in costumes and surrounded by onlookers. Some of the characters they play are immediately recognizable \u2014 Malcolm X, Albert Einstein \u2014 and others don\u2019t register until they announce their names. \u201dWe stand before you as a reflection of community,\u201d the group announces in unison. One after another, they speak up: \u201dAs reminders of social activists.\u201d \u201dSome of us are leaders.\u201d \u201dOr presidents.\u201d Then, together again: \u201dAll of us are citizens.\u201d For the past 10 summers, the Portrait Gallery has assembled a group of Washington, D.

        "In a post a few weeks back, Tania Lombrozo drew attention to research showing that students using laptops and other digital devices in the college classroom are less likely to perform as well as students not using them. It isn\u2019t just that using the devices to multitask during a lecture \u2014 searching the Web, posting on Facebook and Instagram, texting, etc. \u2014 may hurt your performance. It turns out that students around you who see you multitasking show an even more marked in how well they do. There\u2019s nothing surprising in this.",
        "When Savannah Phelan came across a video recently, she found herself brimming with questions she didn\u2019t know the answer to. That\u2019s because the online video depicted her mom, Kellie, talking about being pregnant while serving time in New York City\u2019s Rikers Island jail complex. Savannah brought those questions \u2014 and her mother \u2014 to StoryCorps, where they had one of their first conversations about the video and what it means. \u201dI started using drugs when I got into an accident and I broke my knee,\u201d Kellie Phelan explains to her daughter.",
        "Chickens aren\u2019t traditional pets. But with chicken coops springing up in more and more urban and suburban backyards, some owners take just as much pride in their poultry as they do in their dogs or cats \u2014 so much so that they\u2019re primping and preening them for beauty contests. On a sweltering Sunday afternoon in Fort Collins, Colo. 16 of the region\u2019s finest hens and roosters competed for a chance to win Best in Show at the 2016 Prettiest Chicken Contest.",
        "At the Green Party national convention in Houston, Bernie Sanders may have been mentioned more often so far than the party\u2019s own presumptive nominee, Dr. Jill Stein. The progressive third party has a rare opportunity to expand its reach by picking off disaffected supporters of the Vermont senator. The group had planned to have about 250 people at its quadrennial gathering, but organizers said in the past few weeks interest exploded and that now more than 500 people are expected.",
        "Imagine a Martian trying to make sense of this world and the only available data are the Summer Olympic medal tables from the past century. How much would that explain? Quite a lot, it turns out. In fact, it would be challenging to find anything else so concise that says so much about the past century as the tables below. The four bar charts show the countries that usually win the largest share of medals \u2014 the United States, China, Russia and Germany \u2014 and how they have performed since 1912.",
        "Ginny Thrasher, a old from West Virginia University, took the first of the more than 300 gold medals that will be awarded at the Olympics in Brazil, winning the air rifle on Saturday. Thrasher, the youngest of the 15 members of the U. S. rifle team, bested a field of 50 competitors, comfortably winning the final duel with China\u2019s Du Li, who won gold medals at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics. In the air rifle competition, shooters use pellets with flat fronts that leave clean holes in the paper target that determines scoring. Thrasher is from Springfield, Va.",
        "On a game ranch on the plains outside Johannesburg, where a few shrubs are the only things that break the view across the vast, flat landscape, a handful of workers drop feeding bins from a truck. They\u2019re watched by about a dozen rhino waiting for feeding time. There\u2019s something odd about the animals, though: They don\u2019t have horns. John Hume, who owns the ranch, is a rhino farmer. He made his fortune in taxis and hotels in Zimbabwe and South Africa, and retired to breed animals 25 years ago.",
        "One of the questions raised over the course of this year\u2019s presidential race is about how a President Trump would deal with Russian president Vladimir Putin. One reason to wonder: the Republican Party platform\u2019s new language on policy towards Ukraine. When Republican Party leaders drafted the platform prior to their convention in Cleveland last month, they had relatively little input from the campaign of nominee Donald Trump on most issues \u2014 except when it came to a future Republican administration\u2019s stance on Ukraine. It started when platform committee member Diana Denman tried to insert language calling for the U.",
        "As President Obama settles in for his summer vacation on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Donald Trump will be just 14 miles across the water at a Cape Cod mansion, raising money for his campaign. The reception, and another one on Nantucket, will help launch an intense month of soliciting by Trump: 21 events in 31 days, according to a calendar of the Republican National Committee. The campaign said Trump raised a record $80 million last month for the campaign committee and Republican National Committee, just $10 million short of Hillary Clinton\u2019s operation (Official reports are due Aug. 20).",
        "In recent years the conflict has been playing out on a battleground that\u2019s barely a couple square inches in size. It\u2019s the labels of consumer goods produced in areas under Israeli occupation. Last year the European Union, for example, instructed member countries to not allow imports of products from Jewish settlements in the West Bank to be labeled as, \u201dMade in Israel.\u201d The European Union, like the U. S. considers the settlements illegal. Instead, certain products have to be specifically marked as coming from settlements in the West Bank. This infuriated Israel. Members of the U. S.",
        "Georgina Mumba wasn\u2019t blind. Yet when she was in the fourth grade she was kept for months in a class for kids who couldn\u2019t see. Then she was transferred to a class for the hearing impaired \u2014 even though Mumba wasn\u2019t deaf either. Mumba\u2019s problem: At age 2, she contracted polio and essentially lost the use of her lower limbs. And in Zambia, where she\u2019s from, the educational options for physically disabled people are extremely limited.",
        "To be human is to be constantly at war between our lofty goals and our immediate impulses. Future Me wants me to run 5 miles. Right Now Me wants a cookie. Unfortunately, that totally understandable tendency is one factor that can stop people from completing their education: An unusual organization wants to change all that \u2014 not by the typical means, with money or mentors, but by closing the gaps between students\u2019 intentions and their actions. Ideas42 \u2014 a nonprofit lab \u2014 designs policy interventions to help people make better decisions about their lives.",
        "There was a time when people went to bars to talk to other people, maybe even meet someone new. But that was in the BC era \u2014 before cellphones. \u201dI\u2019ve been in the pub industry for a long time, and progressively it\u2019s become less and less social and more and more antisocial,\u201d Steve Tyler, the owner of the Gin Tub in Sussex, England, tells NPR\u2019s Scott Simon. And that\u2019s bad for business.",
        "Dear Sugar Radio is a weekly podcast from member station WBUR. Hosts Steve Almond and Cheryl Strayed offer \u201dradical empathy\u201d and advice on everything from relationships and parenthood to dealing with drug problems or anxiety. This time the Sugars are joined by Julie Metz, author of Perfection: A Memoir of Betrayal and Renewal. They talk to a young wife who has learned secrets that have her doubting her marriage. In this letter, she describes learning that her husband had hired prostitutes and messaged women on dating websites.",
        "Pour out that almond milk \u2014 the new hip thing is cockroach milk. Well, kind of. The female Pacific beetle cockroach is one of a kind. Unlike other insect species, this Hawaiian native gives birth to live young. And she feeds them a pale, yellow liquid \u201dmilk\u201d from her brood sack. But the craziest thing: Cut open an embryonic beetle roach, and their guts will spill out milk crystals that shimmer like glitter.",
        "When I walked dogs at a Chicago animal shelter, I wondered how each one got there. Whether a pup shirked from my touch or happily greeted me my eyes would well up with salt. I wanted to keep them all. People who work in animal shelters or veterinary clinics try to save the animals that come through their doors. But they\u2019re at high risk of compassion fatigue, a sustained stress that takes a toll on a caregiver\u2019s mind and body \u2014 and her heart."
