        "There have always been many fronts on which the battle to get the song of the summer is ongoing. The biggest song on pop radio isn \u2019 t always the one that sells the most. The lyric that lends itself to the radio can sometimes be overwhelmed by a sound that sounds best seen out of a car window. This time, the results are perhaps more spectacular than usual. What makes a success? In 2016, it depends on what you measure. If you \u2019 re buying downloads, Katy Perry \u2019 s new Olympic anthem, \u201d Rise, \u201d has a lot of most hits.",

They \u2019 re all stored in a hodgepodge of glass boxes, lined up on rolling, something similar to the stacks at a college library or the vault of a record storage company.
