        "This summer, MIT \u2019 s science desk is full about waves, of all kinds \u2014 chemical, gravitational, even mechanical waves. But what is a wave, actually? My editor asked me to figure that one out. And, to be honest, I was right. Is a wave a thing? Or is it the definition of a thing? Or is it a mathematical phenomenon that produces a curve that gives you the description of a thing? Rather than pester a scientist with my somewhat vague questions, I decided to pester a philosopher. Marc Cohen is emeritus professor of philosophy at the University of Washington.",
        "Since April, the Newlead Castellano has been anchored off the Georgia mainland, near Savannah \u2014 with a cargo on board that couldn \u2019 t come aboard.

        "A few years ago, almost every day of Rosanne Mottola \u2019 s life was governed by the pain in her gut. Literally. \u201d I experienced extreme urgency to have to use the medication. Pain. Bleeding, \u201d says Mottola, who has ulcerative colitis. \u201d A lot of times I would waste the whole day without eating, \u201d she says, so that she wouldn \u2019 t have to run to the bathroom so often.

        "The election era is a time of abundance for those who enjoy following politics \u2014 each datum, coup or debacle offers new fodder for conversation and commentary. But for those who aren \u2019 t so keen on politics, a myopic focus on policy and culture can be tiresome. What accounts for this variation among individuals, from the politically engrossed to the less apathetic? There \u2019 s quite a bit of literature on what determines an individual \u2019 s party affiliation and political stance. But beyond particular interest is the more basic question of popular interest.",

        "In Japan, virtually every interest has a magazine dedicated to it, whether it \u2019 s films, music or shooting movies. So it \u2019 s no wonder that food, which has long been tied to Japan \u2019 s political identity, has skyrocketed as a genre of entertainment, which represents about 40 percent of all manga published in that country.

ET, Donald Trump has been saying for months that Republican nominee Hillary Clinton wants to \u201d abolish the Second Amendment, \u201d but now the Republican presidential platform has gone even further. At a party in Wilmington, N. C. on Tuesday afternoon, Trump repeated that charge and then spoke to many observers to cease taking up arms against his president. \u201d Hillary wants to abolish \u2014 essentially abolish \u2014 the Second Amendment, \u201d Obama said. \u201d If she gets to meet her judges, nothing you can do, either.

S. players could recall that previous moment of glory \u2014 because rugby was last played at the Olympics in 1924. The U.

Metcalfe and his kids named their new friend William. He then shared a photo of William and a cheeky complaint about the incident on Tesco\u2019s Facebook wall. \u201dI\u2019m no vet, but I think the tight shrink wrap on the cucumber may have squashed and killed William,\u201d he wrote.

Many of the most powerful antibiotics have lost their efficacy against dangerous bacteria, so finding new antibiotics is a priority. It\u2019s too soon to say for sure if the young researchers are right, but if gumption and enthusiasm count for anything, they stand a fighting chance.

When it\u2019s soft and ripe, it\u2019s dessert.\u201d A traditional staple in Hawaii, breadfruit is sometimes called the tree potato, for its consistency when cooked.",
