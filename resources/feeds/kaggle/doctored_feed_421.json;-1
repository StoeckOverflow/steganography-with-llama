        "Israel detained an employee of the United Nations Development Programme on Palestine, alleging that he helped the political group Hamas. This action comes just days after Israel accused a World Vision employee of funneling millions to Israel, which controls the Gaza strip. Haaretz reports : \u201d According to the Shin Bet statement published Tuesday, Wahid Burish, a from the Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza, was arrested last month for different crimes the agency describes as being agents of Hamas....",
        "The water authorities in Aleppo, Syria, are no longer getting power, without 2 million people without running water \u2014 and at risk of coming under a full sun. The United Nations is calling for an immediate halt to the fighting and at minimum a weekly deadline to allow for the city \u2019 s water and electrical systems to be improved. But there \u2019 s another round of construction ongoing in the strategically crucial city. Aleppo is divided in two : the east and west. But for civilians, it \u2019 s \u201d a city now engaged in its suffering, \u201d as U. N. officials put it.",
        "Churchgoing Americans say their preachers often speak out on important social and political issues and occasionally back or defend particular candidates in favor of U. S. law prohibiting such endorsements. The results from a new survey by the Pew Research Center suggest that the 1954 \u201d Constitutional Amendment \u201d regulating lobbying activity by churches and other religious organizations has had limited influence in restricting such speech. The 2016 Republican nomination calls for a repeal of the Second Amendment, and GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has claimed that if elected he would like to have the law overturned.",
        "It \u2019 s hard to believe the hero of Dr. Seuss \u2019 book Green Eggs and Ham \u2014 which eats 56 this month \u2014 for being suspicious of the whole dish. The illustrated mixture of green meat and brown eggs with alien yolks may look to the most adventurous eaters. Yet even after Theodor Geisel \u2019 s beloved chef \u2019 s book was first published, chefs across the United States are tickled by the idea of putting the green dish on their menus. Would you try it with some kale? Would the thought made diners pale?",
        "For a moment, let \u2019 s pretend. That everything you read about America \u2019 s public school system \u2014 the bitter questions and arcane funding policies, the methods and countless reasons our countries work ( or don \u2019 t ) the way they do \u2014 is actually negotiable. Pretend the obstacles to change have gone like butter on hot blacktop. Now ask yourself : What could \u2014 and should \u2014 we do today? This question drove a bipartisan vote of more than state lawmakers and legislative staffers on an agenda.",
        "The presidents of Syria and Russia met in St. Petersburg on Tuesday, after weeks of enmity between their two countries. Speaking of his trip to Russia, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he \u2019 s ready for a \u201d clean slate \u201d between the two countries, NPR \u2019 s John Kenyon reports. The meeting between Erdogan and President Putin comes just a week after a failed coup attempt in Turkey. \u201d The Syria government is expected to be high on the heels for Erdogan \u2019 s meeting with Putin, but it could be that repairing economic ties will be the last tangible result of the visit, \u201d Bloomberg says.",
        "Let \u2019 s begin with one thing that \u2019 s simple and simple in Syria \u2019 s internal war : Many foreign powers are engaged in the conflict, and all share the goal of driving back the Islamic Revolution. This very loose grouping contains Turkey and Russia, who aren \u2019 t exactly friends, but at least have this particular interest in Syria that could seem to override any inclination to help one another. Alas, the political conflict is riddled with complications and contradictions. Russia is adamant about ousting Syrian President Bashar Assad, and it \u2019 s rumored that Russia has sent in its army to prop up his beleaguered regime.",
        "Instead of stitches and screws, scientists are looking to the next line of medical adhesives \u2014 glues and tape \u2014 to fix us up. Their inspiration? Something like oysters, marine worms and the caddis fly, a type of beetle that lives in creeks all across the United States. The medical adhesives doctors use today go pretty well within the body. Attach a \u201d waterproof \u201d bandage to dry skin, and it will stay good, for a time. And certain kinds of liquid stickum, such as Super Glue and Krazy Glue, which include compounds called cyanoacrylates, help resist degradation in water.",
        "If you walk across your city or town and put your eye to the ground, you \u2019 ll start noticing round black lids embedded in the street. That building underneath is an important landmark, usually marked \u201d water \u201d or \u201d sewer. \u201d But some of the manholes carry the relic equivalent of a bell these mark the origins of America \u2019 s telecommunications. And much of that infrastructure belongs to Verizon, the world \u2019 s largest phone carrier. At least that \u2019 s how you may think of Verizon : a child of a phone operator. But here \u2019 s what else belongs to Verizon : TechCrunch, Engadget and The Huffington Post.",
        "In Paris, a plain old dress has sold for more than $ 150, 000. Now, if that sounds like an unreasonably large price tag, keep this in mind : The 1730s dress is in bad condition, it might have been manufactured at Versailles, and it was part of a cultural revolution. Known as a la volante \u2014 or flying dress \u2014 the pale, luscious yellow brocade gown is patterned with black thread. It \u2019 s with soft pleats in the center, a deep V in cuffs and graceful sleeves. It was produced by Palais Galliera, a fashion store in Paris.",
        "In a damning report published Wednesday, the Department of Defense details the ways in which the Chicago Police Department has abused the rights of the people its departments are sworn to protect. The questions detailed in the report are rich and deep. But they \u2019 re specific, too : a \u201d concept or practice \u201d of discrimination is, of course, made of moments. To be precise, the report emphasizes that this is not a case of a few bad apples. The issues are systemic \u2014 supervisors, policies, internal investigations and officer salaries all play a role, the DOJ concludes.",
        "After a Justice Department investigation excoriated the Baltimore Justice Department for discriminatory practices and administrative failures, the city \u2019 s attorney says there is \u201d a very long way ahead. \u201d At a press conference Wednesday, Mayor Brown said the report \u2014 which also repeated and even criticized racial discrimination, arbitrary arrests and use of excessive force \u2014 was \u201d challenging to implement. \u201d \u201d But let me be clear : I cannot sugarcoat our problems nor will I run away from our most pressing challenges, \u201d she said.",
        "They come from Syria, South Sudan, Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Ten athletes who are refugees are competing on the Refugee Olympic Team at the Rio Games. They are representing the estimated 65 million people around the world who have been driven from their homes. These athletes had to flee their homelands and make new lives elsewhere. Some are living in Europe. Some here in Brazil. Others in Kenya. Some of them don\u2019t know if the families they left behind when they fled war are alive or dead.",
        "There are eureka moments in life that can change human history \u2014 and then there are eureka moments that give us a window into the complexities of the human situation. That\u2019s how I think about the shower in my hotel room here in Rio, which can be turned on via the sink faucets (! ). Evidently, what struck me as a small eureka moment also resonated with many people: Since I tweeted a video showing the shower head being controlled from the sink taps this weekend, it\u2019s been retweeted and liked by people every day.",
        "WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is crafting a new storyline about who may have provided the material he published that caused an implosion in the Democratic National Committee\u2019s leadership this summer. U. S. officials and private sector have said they\u2019re highly confident that hackers associated with Russia\u2019s intelligence services compromised the DNC\u2019s email system and extracted emails that embarrassed the party\u2019s leadership. But it appears Assange wants to puncture the narrative that he\u2019s a cat\u2019s paw for Russian President Vladimir Putin, and that to do so he has seized upon an unsolved homicide in Washington, D. C.",

        "Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion that \u201dmaybe there is\u201d something Second Amendment supporters could do to stop his Democratic rival from picking Supreme Court justices caused outrage among those who read it as an incitement to violence. Trump says he was merely talking about the political power of advocates and the National Rifle Association to defeat Hillary Clinton. But it\u2019s far from the first time the Republican nominee has made a statement that seems open to sinister interpretations.",
        "Don\u2019t look for Donald Trump ads in your commercial breaks just yet \u2014 the GOP nominee hasn\u2019t released a general election TV ad with less than 90 days until Election Day. In fact, as his poll numbers have cratered after the conventions, he\u2019s being swamped on air with $52 million in ads from Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign alone, according to NBC News. Add in outside groups, and forces are spending a total of $91 million to hit the GOP presidential nominee. outside groups have spent only $8 million. The gets plenty of free media, he\u2019s noted.",
        "A few months ago, when Dr. Thomas Lee logged in to his patients\u2019 electronic medical records to renew a prescription, something unexpected popped up.

Lee, a primary care doctor at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, was scheduled to see the patient in three days. \u201dI was horrified,\u201d he says.

        "A new film starring Meryl Streep, which opens in the U. S. Friday, tells the improbable story of Florence Foster Jenkins, a New York socialite who pronounced herself a coloratura soprano despite a distinct lack of talent. Who could\u2019ve guessed that Jenkins, who favored elaborate costumes and strangled phrases with abandon, would resurface with such gusto decades after her death in 1944. She\u2019s been the subject of a Broadway play starring Judy Kaye, a new biography, a documentary and now two movies released in the U. S. within the span of six months.",
        "Meryl Streep works hard to sing badly in her new film, Florence Foster Jenkins. In it, she plays the title character, based on an actual heiress and socialite born in 1868, who devoted her life to music \u2014 despite the fact that she had a squeaky, screechy singing voice. Streep tells Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross that she prepared for the role by listening to recordings of Jenkins. She found herself fascinated by the ways in which the heiress\u2019 performances almost worked. \u201dShe came so close in moments,\u201d Streep says.",
        "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump laid out his plan for the economy on Monday Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton will take her turn on Thursday. While candidates are talking about tax rates, tax breaks and trade, they are ignoring an economic issue that soon may matter far more to working Americans: robots. Economists and business analysts warn that before long, tens of millions of workers will be displaced by technological advances that include robots and artificial intelligence. Just one example: The most common job in most states is \u201dtruck driver.\u201d What happens when driverless trucks replace them?",
        "NPR was invited to observe two focus groups of swing voters from Ohio and Arizona on Tuesday in Washington, D. C. \u201d Moms\u201d are identified by pollsters as women predominantly between the ages of 18 and 44, who have kids under 18 living at home and who shop at stores at least once a month. In these groups, the women were identified only by their first names. The research was funded by Corp.

        "Sam Esmail, creator of the TV show Mr. Robot, learned the hard way that hacking isn\u2019t easy.

        "The videos trickled out slowly on social media \u2014 slowly, because those posting them had to use special software to get around what seemed to be a internet block. This video showed thousands of people in the streets of the northern Ethiopian town of Gondar. The size of the crowd was significant in a country where civil protests are usually banned. Even more significant? The location o f this protest. For the last nine months, protests have erupted further south, in Oromiya, home to Ethiopia\u2019s largest but historically marginalized ethnic group, the Oromo.",
        "Just days after editors ended publication of China\u2019s leading liberal history journal last month, a new edition of the magazine is out again. But the original publishers are calling this a pirate edition \u2014 and they\u2019re preparing to fight it in court. The magazine, the Annals of the Chinese Nation, or Yanhuang Chunqiu in Chinese, is seen as the standard bearer of the embattled liberal wing of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party.

        "Puerto Rico is in the midst of one of the worst Zika outbreaks of any region in the northern hemisphere. The island has been reporting roughly 1, 500 new cases of Zika each week. Hundreds of pregnant women are already infected, and public health officials say the outbreak in Puerto Rico probably won\u2019t start to subside until September or October. Yet health officials also say efforts to stop the spread of the virus are being hampered by mistrust, indifference and fatigue among residents, over what some view as just the latest tropical disease to hit the island."
