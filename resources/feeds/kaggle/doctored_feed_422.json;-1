        "I grew up in the Detroit area, where water skiing is as iconic a summer drink as ice cream cones and Popsicles. Maybe more so. It \u2019 s a frozen product made from water, salt and some sort of flavoring \u2014 usually good. It is firmer than a slushy, softer than sorbet and smoother than granita. Unlike with a ice cone, the flavor is added in before freezing, instead of being melted over a frozen ball at the end. You might know it as cold ice, but it bears little resemblance to the hard, tough variety you find in cold freezers.",

The annual Perseid meteor shower, already one of the most reliably important celestial events, continues to be especially good this season.

        "Aparna Nancherla and Maz Jobrani are both comedians, and they \u2019 re both used to people totally butchering their names. For Jobrani, who \u2019 s and works in Los Angeles, the a in his real name, which sounds like Mazda, often comes out like more like has, or maze. His real name becomes jabroni, which is also a real word, a slangy Albanian term for insulting someone \u2019 s opponent popularized by The Matrix. As for Nancherla, who \u2019 s a New standup comic and it comes \u201d pretty frequently, \u201d more often with her last name. \u201d I like Nancheria a lot. People prefer to make it an i.",
        "Large groups expect health rates to continue rising by about 6 percent in 2017, a moderate increase coupled with historical trends that pretty far outpaces growth in the US, two new trends show. \u201d These cost changes, while stable, are both unsustainable and unacceptable, \u201d wrote Brian Marcotte, CEO of the Harvard Business Group on Healthcare, a coalition of very large investors that got responses from 133 organizations.",
        "When tennis star Maria Sharapova admitted in March to having taken the heart drug meldonium, the public got a startling glimpse of a common practice that \u2019 s often called \u201d legal doping. \u201d It involves taking a new prescription drug that could improve performance but hasn \u2019 t been approved by authorities. And lots of countries competing in the Rio Paralympics will be taking advantage of this loophole, doping authorities say. \u201d If it \u2019 s not banned, everyone will use it, \u201d says Richard Evans, director of the Ion Expression Laboratory at the Salk Institute and an advisor for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.",
        "Nearly 25 years after Anita Hill accused her former boss Thomas Thomas \u2014 then a Supreme Court nominee \u2014 of making lewd jokes, the fight against sexual discrimination is again in the spotlight. Women are moving to change policies at schools across the country. Bill Cosby \u2014 once a beloved figure of conservative culture \u2014 is now widely reviled because of acts of rape and assault. More specifically, more than 20 women say advertising mogul Roger Ailes harassed them at work.",
        "When 31 governors called for a ban on Syrian migrants coming into the U. S. after last November \u2019 s terrorist attacks in Paris, it united officials across the country. They are leading the wave of opposition to these protests by taking a leading role in resettling them. \u201d If they didn \u2019 t have the churches and synagogues providing what they do, this policy would collapse, \u201d says Jennifer Quigley, referring to the poor resettlement program that is now under attack from Syria and many governors.",
        "Success on the ground against the Islamic State won \u2019 t translate into an immediate reduction in the losses from attacks in the West, the chief U. S. counterterrorism leader told NPR. Nicholas Rasmussen, president of the National Counterterrorism Center, stated the tactical gains the U. S. military and its partners are taking in Iraq and Syria are a \u201d necessary \u201d part of quashing the danger it presents \u2014 but not \u201d sufficient. \u201d \u201d We do need that success \u2014 but there \u2019 ll be a lag in the benefits we accrue, \u201d he said.",
        "When Bridget Elizabeth Lambert was 5 years old, her grandfather built her a dollhouse. It \u2019 s a modest wooden structure, filled with yellow shutters, a few handmade chairs and dressers scattered through its sparse rooms. Decades later when Lambert was searching for another inspiration, she found out the dollhouse was somewhere in her parents \u2019 house, like dust. Lambert \u2019 s world of miniatures was sparked anew. \u201d What they say, psychologically, is you have painted over a space, \u201d Lambert explains, looking up at the dollhouse.

        "Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump has released a second list of economic advisers in less than a decade, and this time the names are also all women. The advisers include five longtime GOP fundraisers, including John Hendricks, and chairman of ABC Broadcasting in Wisconsin, who was called \u201d America \u2019 s richest woman \u201d by Time magazine. New Jersey Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey, who authored several influential but equally controversial articles criticizing Hillary Clinton \u2019 s health care proposals in the 1990s, is second on the list. More recently, she has written books taking on the Affordable Housing Act.",

Raisman also had to give up ground to earn the medal. The finish came shortly after the pair seized a second consecutive gold medal for the U. S. women \u2019 s gymnastics team.

        "In the opening ceremony of Rio\u2019s Olympic Games, Brazil\u2019s favelas, or shantytowns, were showcased as the birthplace of a lot of Brazil\u2019s culture. That was showbiz. In three of the most iconic communities, the reality of how these Olympics are affecting favela residents is more complicated. Brazil is one of the most unequal countries in the world. In Rio, at least 25 percent of the population lives in impoverished communities. Take Santa Marta. Perched above Rio\u2019s expensive South Zone, it\u2019s the city\u2019s most internationally famous favela.",

Until now, the for the oldest vertebrate was the bowhead whale, known to have lived up to 211 years.",
        "After decades in which diversity of roles \u2014 and accents \u2014 seemed to guide her career, Meryl Streep has come to specialize in divas. Since 2005, she\u2019s played a cookbook maven, a fashion magazine editor, and a British prime minister. Now, in Florence Foster Jenkins, she plays a diva, albeit one who couldn\u2019t sing. That doesn\u2019t seem to have fazed Jenkins and, of course, it doesn\u2019t fluster Streep. Coq au vin, Paris fashion week, the Falklands War, Mozart \u2014 she can handle them all, and at roughly the same pitch.",

The Virgin Islands and Washington, D. C. are represented in Rio \u2014 but not every American state is: No U. S. athletes said they were from North Dakota, West Virginia or Wyoming.

        "If there\u2019s such a thing as an average U. S. Olympic athlete at the Rio Games, she might look something like this: a woman from California who stands about 5 foot 8 \u2014 and is now at her first Olympic Games.

        "The town of Brookfield, in Missouri, is a community with a population of about 4, 500. Becky Cleveland, who grew up here, says that when she was a kid, there were four grocery stores. Today there is just one, and a nearby . The vacant storefronts on Main Street make it clear that the town is no longer in its prime. Like many rural towns, Brookfield\u2019s top moneymakers in decades past were agriculture, transportation and manufacturing. While those industries still exist today, each has taken a hit. The town lost an auto plant.",
        "It was two years ago this week that a police officer shot and killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. in a case that became an inflection point in the way Americans talk about race and policing. During protests in Ferguson, the larger movement described as Black Lives Matter metamorphosed from a Twitter hashtag into a discrete political project. And you could still plainly hear the echoes of Ferguson this summer, following the fatal shootings of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge and Philando Castile in suburban Minneapolis, and in the fatal shootings of police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge.",

        "The question is repeated in one form or another millions of times a day in social media and random conversation. It comes primarily from the backers of Donald Trump, but also from others \u2014 including the simply curious: Why are the media obsessed with Trump\u2019s controversies and not Clinton\u2019s? It surely does seem that, at times, the news is all about Trump. This has been a common impression, and complaint, throughout the presidential campaign. In the primary season, cable news often carried Trump\u2019s boisterous rally speeches in their entirety, while other hopefuls struggled for any airtime at all.",
        "Welcome to the third installment of Read, Watch, Binge! our summer recommendation series. As you may recall from our first list, we were tired of algorithms that only matched books to books or movies to movies. So this month, we\u2019ve enlisted the help of real live humans to pair TV series with movies, musicals, books, comics, podcasts and more. (You can catch up on last two lists here and here.)

        "New York Times reporter Rukmini Callimachi is known for her reporting on terrorism and the Islamic State. Her recent jailhouse interview with Harry Sarfo, a German citizen who joined ISIS and trained in Syria before disavowing the group, revealed the organization\u2019s particular interest in recruits from Europe. \u201d[Harry] was very much a desirable target for them, given his German passport and his experience living in London \u2014 two countries that they\u2019re still trying to infiltrate,\u201d Callimachi tells Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross.",
        "A group of recent studies on technology in education, across a wide range of settings, have come up far short of a ringing endorsement. The studies include research on schools and higher ed, both blended learning and online, and show results ranging from mixed to negative. A deeper look into these reports gives a sense that, even as computers become ubiquitous in classrooms, there\u2019s a lot we still don\u2019t know \u2014 or at least that we\u2019re not doing to make them effective tools for learning.",
        "For years I was a totally lopsided exerciser. I did aerobic workouts until the cows came home, easily meeting the government\u2019s recommendation of 150 minutes of or 75 minutes of exercise per week. But I rarely picked up a dumbbell or did a pushup. I definitely didn\u2019t follow the government\u2019s advice to work out all my major muscle groups with resistance training at least twice a week. I wasn\u2019t the only one falling short on that front.",
        "There are waves and there are bubbles. In previous installations of Hip Hop Family Tree, his history of hip hop culture told through comics, Ed Piskor charted waves and the eddies that would build into waves.

John Paul White\u2019s voice was meant to be heard on its own. At the start of his career, he was poised to be a breakout solo singer until Capitol Records dropped him before the release of his debut album. That set him on a path to writing songs for other people and then forming The Civil Wars with Joy Williams \u2014 a duo whose strength lay in its harmonies.",
        "How do you get rid of river blindness? It\u2019s all about the worm.

Richards Jr. who directs the Carter Center\u2019s river blindness elimination and other tropical disease programs.

Men perform in traditional fundoshi (loincloth) to purify themselves before gods, to bring luck and prosperity or to welcome new seasons."
