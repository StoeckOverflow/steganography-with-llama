Earth is not 6, 000 years old and it wasn \u2019 t formed by a great flood 4, 500 years ago. ( Earth is 4. 5 million years old. ) Animals and dinosaurs did not coexist. ( These life forms missed each other by many tens of years. ) When creationist claims are put forth as science in nature or taught as science in school, our children lose out because their natural literacy is diminished.",
        "Daria Vera has completely forgotten that brutally awful summer in 1966. She goes to the back room of her tiny ranch home and comes back holding a box of roses. \u201d This is my daughter, \u201d Vera says in Spanish, pointing to a photo in one photograph. \u201d She was so small \u2014 probably 2 years old \u2014 always with us, especially during the strike. \u201d In 1966, Vera was only 20. Both she and her family picked onions and cantaloupes for a living, with their son by their side.",
        "Half a month ago this summer, Mexican activist Cesar Chavez joined thousands of striking farmworkers in Texas as they converged on Tyler, the state capital, to promote fair wages and humane living conditions. Their march, which traveled from the punishing melon fields of South Texas, was his march, too. It was a deep and abiding appreciation of the challenges of the farmworker \u2019 s life that made his commitment to labor organizing. The life of Cesar Chavez mirrored that of the youth he was trying to help. Their cause \u2014 La Causa \u2014 was his.",
        "The French Riviera Authority of Cannes has banned beachgoers from wearing a swimsuit designed for Muslim women, called a burkini, citing the continued Islamist violence. Going into effect late last year, a city ordinance bans the burkini as well as any swimwear that \u201d ostentatiously displays religious content, when France...",
        "If it \u2019 s Friday in December, there \u2019 s the potential for a news conference. This Friday, that means news returns. The Clinton Foundation, in an effort to pressure President Trump into releasing his data, released the Clintons \u2019 2015 numbers. The Clintons spent $ 10. 6 million combined, derived from speeches, and paid an initial federal tax credit of 34. 2 percent. Clinton \u2019 s vice presidential candidate, Tim Kaine, also released 10 different \u2019 returns. In 2015, Kaine made about $ 313, 000 and collected a 16. 1 percent tax rate.",

Their 2015 return was filed today by the Clinton Administration, almost five months after they signed it for filing. The Clintons overpaid the return and got a refund of more than $ 1 million. The Coalition \u2019 s income plunged next year. Adjusted gross income for 2015 was $ 10. 6 million, compared with $ 27. 9 million for the previous year. Charitable organizations accounted for 9. 8 percent of their net gross income.",
        "Just how much is President Trump worth? \u201d I \u2019 m really rich, \u201d Trump said during his presidential announcement ceremony in New York at Trump Tower, one of the tallest buildings around the world donning his name. But just how rich has never been a question. It was one before the mogul run for president and, well, it remains a big question today, too, despite Trump pulling up a form declaring he is worth roughly $ 9 billion. Trump has never liked to get specific about his wealth, but celebrities and presidential candidates have no idea.",
        "The U. S. elite gymnasts have dazzled all week in Rio. And we \u2019 re not surprised about their leotards. The Americans won the team silver on Tuesday, and Simone Biles and Aly Raisman took gold and silver in the individual on Thursday. This wasn \u2019 t traditionally a tournament the U. S. dominated. The American women didn \u2019 t win their first team gold until 1996. But they have now taken the team title at the first two Olympics, and American women have won the individual at the last four Summer Games.",
        "Jonathan Garaas has learned a few things in three years of backyard beekeeping : Bees are fascinating. They \u2019 re powerful. And keeping them alive is not enough. Every two years, the Fargo, N. D. resident opens the hives to check the insects and search for varroa mites, pests that suck the bees \u2019 blood and can transmit infection. If he sees too many of the parasites, he seeks a chemical treatment. Garaas has studied hives in his first two decades as a novice beekeeper.",
        "It came down to penalty kicks \u2014 and after two of the U. S. women \u2019 s soccer international players missed theirs, Coach Solo couldn \u2019 t stop Brazil \u2019 s shots in an elimination game in the quarterfinals of Rio \u2019 s Summer Olympics. Facing their old rivals Pia Sundhage, the Americans were trying to hold on a draw with Colombia that took an otherwise stellar qualifying round to the games in Argentina. But they couldn \u2019 t capitalize on early chances against Cuba, and Sundhage \u2019 s squad made them upset in the end. With the loss, a depleted U. S.",
        "On Wednesday evening, the United States Department of Justice announced the conclusion of a yearlong investigation into the Baltimore Police Department, which found that BPD habitually violates the political rights of its residents. These acts, the Justice Department argues, have an outsized effect on the city \u2019 s LGBT population. I spoke to some neighborhood folks who have been thinking about relations for years, and they told me the committee \u2019 s findings didn \u2019 t particularly concern them. The investigation was spurred by the arrest of Freddie Gray, a homeless man whose head was severed in the back of a pickup van last spring.",
        "One thing you know it \u2019 s August at the multiplex is that the rather unextraordinary virtues of the thoughtful horror drama Hell or High Water \u2014 a plot that starts off in the first scene alone of the fourth or fifteenth \u201d heroes \u201d and \u201d villains \u201d equally deserving of our empathy, and who bring into focus through behavior rather than dialogue a palpable sense of place basic narrative structure \u2014 make it feel like the pinnacle of cinematic artistry.",
        "The Colorado River \u2014 better known for running through majestic National Parks and powering hydroelectric dams \u2014 forms an unlikely backdrop for the creation of a jazz song. But Ren\u00e9 Marie was answering phones at Denver\u2019s jazz radio station KUVO when she sat down across from a fellow volunteer fundraiser. He would soon invite her on a canoeing trip and, without yet having seen the eponymous river, she wrote the giddy \u201dColorado River Song\u201d on the way there.",
        "On Sunday, the city of Flint, Mich. will no longer be under a federal state of emergency. A new report suggests that lead levels in the city\u2019s water are dropping, though researchers still recommend caution because of the health dangers posed by even small amounts of lead. Filters have been distributed to many residents, but they don\u2019t work for everyone, and some still depend on bottled water to meet their basic needs. The problems started in April 2014, when the city\u2019s water supply was switched to a new, corrosive source as a measure.",
        "Lead problems with the water in Flint, Mich. have prompted people across the country to ask whether they or their families have been exposed to the toxic metal in their drinking water, too. When it comes to assessing the risk, it\u2019s important to look in the right places. Even when municipal water systems\u2019 lead levels are considered perfectly fine by federal standards, the metal can leach into tap water from lead plumbing. Kate Gilles moved to Washington, D. C. from Rhode Island for a job in international public health six years ago.",
        "On small farms and in gardens around the world, a legless invertebrate has been quietly helping crops grow \u2014 simply by eating and pooping. That\u2019s vermicomposting \u2014 using the power of worms for the good of humanity. A growing number of advocates believe this technique can improve soil quality, produce more food to feed hungry mouths and even increase income for some farmers. It sounds too good to be true. Are worms really poised to take the agricultural world by storm? Well, not exactly.",
        "When you first meet Moises the first thing you notice is his hair \u2014 or the lack of it. He\u2019s completely bald. \u201dAt age 11, I developed this condition, called alopecia areata, where I lost my hair,\u201d says a science writer in Berkeley, Calif. \u201dIt started in patches, but eventually I lost it all.\u201d A few years ago was working on a book about autoimmune diseases, like allergies, asthma, Crohn\u2019s disease and alopecia. He talked to many people who were using an unlikely tool to treat their problems: parasitic worms that live in your gut \u2014 permanently.",
        "Every war has its literature. Usually the books come years after the guns go silent, but the . 11 wars are now the longest in U. S. history, and with no clear end in sight, a growing cadre of veterans is writing fiction about them. Their stories about Iraq and Afghanistan don\u2019t have Hollywood gunfights, and they aren\u2019t action thrillers. \u201dI think you can get a lot more nuance, a lot more meaning out of a story that isn\u2019t based in some kind of grand battle,\u201d says writer Maximilian Uriarte.",
        "Iraq War veteran Brian Castner opens his new memoir, The Long Walk, with a direct and disturbing warning: \u201dThe first thing you should know about me is that I\u2019m Crazy,\u201d he writes. \u201dI haven\u2019t always been. Until that one day, the day I went Crazy, I was fine. Or I thought I was.

        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s recent surge in the polls is being fueled in part by a demographic that President Obama lost handily four years ago \u2014 white, voters. \u201dIn over a no Democratic presidential candidate has carried white voters with a college degree,\u201d said Michelle Diggles, a senior political analyst with the think tank Third Way, who described the split between the white working class and whites with a college degree as \u201dthe most underreported story of this year.\u201d GOP nominee Donald Trump is hoping that white voters can fuel his own victory.",

        "Computer programs often reflect the biases of their very human creators. That\u2019s been well established. The question now is: How can we fix that problem? Adam Kalai thinks we should start with the bits of code that teach computers how to process language. He\u2019s a researcher for Microsoft and his latest project \u2014 a joint effort with Boston University \u2014 has focused on something called a word embedding. \u201dIt\u2019s kind of like a dictionary for a computer,\u201d he explains.",

        "Despite the vast differences between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, there were some striking similarities between the economic speeches they delivered this week. They both spoke in Michigan, where they both talked a lot about manufacturing, with both of them insisting that they would obtain fairer trade deals. That\u2019s because both candidates are trying to latch onto \u2014 and insist that they can alleviate \u2014 a pervasive feeling among Americans that they just can\u2019t get ahead, and that it\u2019s related to a U. S. economy.",
        "Michael Phelps dropped both the hammer and the mic on the Rio Olympics Saturday night, turning in a scorching butterfly leg in the men\u2019s 4x100m medley relay that helped his team secure gold and set a new Olympic record on the last night of Olympic pool swimming in Brazil. Both the American men\u2019s and women\u2019s medley relay teams repeated their golden races of the London 2012 games, with the women\u2019s relay bringing Team USA its 1, 000th gold medal in the Summer Olympic Games (dating back to 1896).",

        "Eighty years ago this month, the United States competed in the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games in Nazi Germany, with 18 athletes part of the U. S. squad. Track star Jesse Owens, one of the greatest Olympians of all time, won four gold medals. What the 17 other Olympians did in Berlin, though, has largely been forgotten \u2014 and so too has their rough return home to racial segregation. \u201dDetermination!

        "Astronomers think they\u2019ve discovered a new planet in our solar system. Now all they have to do is find it. Nobody\u2019s actually seen the new planet. The reason astronomers think it\u2019s out there is the strange behavior of some smallish objects in the Kuiper Belt, a collection of celestial objects orbiting in the outer reaches of the solar system. \u201dThe seven most distant of these objects, when they go really far away, they all go in the same direction,\u201d says Mike Brown, professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).",
