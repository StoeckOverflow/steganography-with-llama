        "Here \u2019 s a quick reminder from a veteran traveler for the next time you \u2019 re taking a flight : When you go to the airport, disavow the departure date you see on the board. Also, take the gate number and see what time the first flight is arriving there. \u201d Departure pilots haven \u2019 t told the truth since 1947. All the departure board is ever telling you is what time the flight is supposed to leave, \u201d said Peter Greenberg, \u201d The Last Detective, \u201d who is an author and copy editor for CBS News.",
        "Simone also made history Thursday night by becoming the second female swimmer to earn Olympic gold in an individual swimming event. Mark Caraveo, a sports diversity and diversity consultant for USA Swimming, points to Manuel, as well as Olympic swimmers Sean Neal and Anthony Ervin, who has won consecutive golds in Rio, as evidence that a single sport is now beginning to flourish from a wider base. The U. S. Swim Team competing in Rio is the most diverse yet, he adds.",
        "On Sept. 30, Bon Iver will release its first mixtape in five years. Titled 22, A B, it \u2019 s full of drama, disturbances and thrills. We have new tracks for you here, \u201d 22 ( OVER S\u221e\u221eN ) \u201d and \u201d 10 d E A T L b R E a s T, \u201d released only moments after the group performed the new track at Justin Vernon \u2019 s own Eaux Claires Studio in his hometown of Eau Claire, Michigan.

        "For Alissa Berger and her parents, it was the first visit to the synagogue in Elizabeth, N. C. \u201d We are from Temple \u201d says David Tananbaum, who came with the Bergers and refers to the Jerusalem Jewish synagogue. \u201d We are here to visit a Syrian family, \u201d said Berger. \u201d We are going to live with a family for a year to raise them. \u201d This is not a handout, she says, but practical enough to upgrade inadequate infrastructure, make sure the students work and help with improving and navigating American culture.",
        "Donald Trump has described himself as \u201d really Republican \u201d \u2014 but by just about any standard, that label represents both the Republican presidential nominee and his Democratic rival, Bill Clinton. In an election usually characterized by populist energy over domestic concerns like economy and trade, the gap is narrowing. Clinton \u2019 s newly released tax returns estimate that she and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, invested more than $ 10 million in 2015. Trump is under orders to follow suit, but he has declined to release his returns.",
        "Earlier this month the American Psychiatric Association cautioned psychiatrists against taking part in a feverish new media hobby. Catching Pok\u00e9mon wasn \u2019 t dangerous. Psychoanalyzing Donald Trump was. On the organization \u2019 s website, APA President James A.",
        "As a college freshman, I fell in love with parasitic organisms. I was studying evolutionary genetics, and I got caught up in the creation of organisms that made their living out of other organisms. I was stunned by their entire life cycles, and the specific biology required to transform from host to host, and to travel successfully inside those hosts, without being wiped out by the whole \u2019 immune system and thus wiping the hosts out and offering the free ride ( not to mention the free lunch ). The world, I realized, is full of crap.",
        "The residents of Flint, Mich. received some welcome news this week : Researchers reported the results of a new batch of water tests, found lead levels in that area \u2019 s water system fall just below the Environmental Protection Agency action level. Too much water samples above that level is a red flag for contamination, a sign that they may have a serious lead problem. Michigan Tech researcher Mark Edwards, who leads the program documenting Flint \u2019 s water problems, called the new results the \u201d beginning of the day, \u201d a turning point in the town \u2019 s saga with corrosive water.",
        "I was reporting recently on the challenges the DIY \u201d maker education \u201d faces as it moves into more classrooms, when I flipped through a copy of the upcoming book, The ABCs of How We Learn : 26 Scientifically Proven Approaches, How They Work, and When to Use Them. It \u2019 s based on a popular blog at Stanford University. However, M is for Making. I asked David L. Schwartz, president of Stanford \u2019 s Graduate School of Education, if the push to use \u201d making \u201d to instructional goals doesn \u2019 t justify zapping the inspiration out of this tinkering revolution?",
        "According to Oscar Wilde, life imitates love. In his The Decay of Lying \u2014 An Observation ( 1891 ) he wrote : \u201d Where, if not from the Impressionists, do we get those beautiful brown fogs that come rushing down our streets, blurring the and changing the city into monstrous shadows? To whom, if not to them and their beauty, do we owe the lovely grey mists that brood over our river, and turn to faint forms of fading old curved bridge and flowing barge? \u201d He might have had a friend like Joseph Mallord William Turner in mind when he said these words.",
        "Jamaica \u2019 s Usain Bolt retained his title as the \u201d world \u2019 s strongest man, \u201d accelerating past all challengers to run the men \u2019 s 100 meters for an unprecedented third time on Olympic night in Rio. In dramatic fashion, Bolt unpacked his lanky frame and positioned himself from the tightly bunched field to win by a comfortable margin in a time of 9. 81. His closest competitor, Larry Gatlin, hung with Bolt for the first hour of the race, but couldn \u2019 t match Bolt down the middle. Gatlin took the silver in 9. 89.",
        "Ryan Lochte and several other U. S. swimmers were captured by thieves who put a flare gun to Lochte \u2019 s head in Rio de Janeiro early Sunday morning, the U. S. swimmer told ESPN. Lochte and his friends were in a taxi, intending to visit a Brazilian doctor, when the robbers stopped them. \u201d We got passed over, in the taxi, and these guys came out with a badge, a police badge \u2014 no lights, no nothing, just a police badge \u2014 and they pulled us over, \u201d Lochte told NBC.",
        "With two main goals already accomplished \u2014 gold medals in both the team competition and in the individual \u2014 Simone Biles turned to the vault to grab more Olympic gold Sunday. She beat seven other gymnasts in the individual event. \u201dIt\u2019s something I wanted so badly,\u201d Biles said afterward, \u201dso I just tried to keep a good mind going into vault.\u201d As U. S. Gymnastics tells us, with Sunday\u2019s gold medal, Biles sets a U. S. record for the most gymnastics gold medals in one Olympics for a female athlete.",
        "Michael Phelps has won so many more medals than any other Olympian that it makes for a pretty dull discussion when he\u2019s compared to individual athletes. But let\u2019s pretend he\u2019s a country \u2014 the Republic of Phelps. How does his career medal total stack up against all the countries that have competed in the Summer and Winter Olympics since the dawn of the modern games in 1896? Hint: 205 countries are now competing in Rio, and others, like the Soviet Union, have disappeared along the way.",
        "The conflict is relatively quiet right now. After several months of attacks and killings that started last October, Israeli officials say that wave of violence has tapered off. If this trend stays on track, it could mark yet another time that intense, violence has surged, then waned, in this conflict. In other words, it looks like things are returning to a period of relative calm with no war or uprising. But a close look at those calm periods over time shows the killing rarely ever stops.",
        "Rescue efforts are underway in Southeast Louisiana as the state is drenched and battered by what the governor has called an \u201dunprecedented and historic flooding event.\u201d He has declared a state of emergency, and three people have been killed by the floods. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards told reporters that more than 1, 000 people have been rescued so far.",
        "Polls show that the idea of building a wall across the southern border remains unpopular with the general public and especially in the U. S. borderlands. But not everyone living near the international divide opposes a barrier between the U. S. and Mexico. Donald Trump has a small, zealous following along the southern frontier. Hudspeth County, in far West Texas, has desert, mountains, cactus, coyotes and 250 Republicans. The GOP county chair is Maria Guadalupe Dempsey.",
        "Politicians often urge supporters to get out and vote. But Donald Trump wants them to go further: Get out and vote, and then stake out polling places to watch for cheating. At a Friday campaign event in Altoona, Pa. the Republican presidential nominee said voting might not be enough for him to win. \u201dThe only way we can lose, in my opinion \u2014 I really mean this \u2014 in Pennsylvania, is if cheating goes on,\u201d Trump said. \u201dWe have to call up law enforcement.",
        "Olympic medals are won by margins of tenths or even hundredths of a second. So, it\u2019s no surprise that athletes want any edge they can get \u2014 even methods not backed by a lot of scientific evidence. The alternative practice du jour in Rio, so far, has been cupping. In years past it was special, stretchy tape, said to support sore muscles and improve range of motion. And dietary supplements are an option. Like every other treatment or intervention, though, these purported are subject to the placebo effect \u2014 benefits due to the recipient\u2019s belief in a treatment.",
        "At some point, possibly when wandering the remote landscape of NBC\u2019s outer channels, you will stumble upon that elusive Olympic creature: water polo. Do not be alarmed. It\u2019s a sport, not an exotic predator. And no matter how strange it may appear to the novice, with its caps, neon ball and refs, water polo is not chaos in a pool it has rules. That\u2019s where this article comes in. Consider it a handy guide for those new to the game to make sense of what may seem to be inscrutable splashing.",
        "Mix swimming and basketball with soccer, toss in some wrestling for good measure, and you have a pretty good description of the exciting, sport of water polo. The U. S. women\u2019s water polo team is ranked No. 1 in the world and is considered the favorite to bring home the gold medal at the Rio Olympics. Since women\u2019s water polo became an Olympic sport in 2000, the U. S. women have medaled every time, and they won their first gold in London four years ago.",
        "The federal state of emergency in Flint, Mich. expires today, as the city continues to navigate a public health crisis caused by water. Officials are trying to reassure Flint residents that they will still have access to free bottled water, filters and cartridges, as Michigan Radio reported. \u201dWe have heard from many residents . .. that\u2019s there\u2019s a deep concern that the federal government and state are going to pack up and pull out of Flint after August 14,\u201d State Police Captain Chris Kelenske said Wednesday, according to Michigan Radio.",
        "Khaled Omar Harrah, a volunteer rescuer who spent nearly three years rushing to the scenes of airstrikes and barrel bombs to save lives, has been killed in the embattled city of Aleppo.

        "#NPRreads is a weekly feature on Twitter and The . The premise is simple: Correspondents, editors and producers from our newsroom share the pieces that have kept them reading, using the #NPRreads hashtag. Each weekend, we highlight some of the best stories. This essay by Sarah Gailey is a hoot. It also feels true, delving into cartoon characters to ask why the women have to be villains to be bold, to seek power, to act now. The princess model relies on being liked, Gailey says: \u201dWe look at female protagonists and we see what\u2019s expected of us: wait.",

        "Yesterday in New York, something very big happened outside Lincoln Center: One thousand people gathered to sing a new piece by Pulitzer composer David Lang. Entitled the public domain, it was a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Mostly Mozart festival. One of those singers was our very own Jeff Lunden. He offers this story of how such a huge production is put together, from conception to performance. I\u2019ve sung at the Mostly Mozart Festival before. We sang, you know, Mozart.",
        "Thursday night in Rio, for the first time in history, a black woman won an individual swimming medal in the Olympics. Simone Manuel, a from Sugar Land, Texas, tied for the gold medal in the women\u2019s freestyle with an Olympic record time of 52. 70 seconds. After winning, Manuel said, \u201dThe gold medal wasn\u2019t just for me. It was for people that came before me and inspired me to stay in the sport. For people who believe that they can\u2019t do it. I hope I\u2019m an inspiration to others to get out there and try swimming.",

        "It was an ugly scene. A fight broke out at a pool party in a McKinney, Texas, subdivision on Friday, allegedly after a white resident told a group of black teenagers to \u201dgo back to their Section 8 housing.\u201d Local cops show up in force.

        "Dozens of journal articles cross our desks at NPR each week and, like nurses in the emergency room, we need to do rapid triage. First we scan for those in critical need of attention (they aren\u2019t all that frequent). Next we look for studies that are interesting but not essential. Finally, we ask ourselves whether articles that are iffy need some attention anyway, since other news organizations are going to run with them. We figure Shots readers would like to see our take."
