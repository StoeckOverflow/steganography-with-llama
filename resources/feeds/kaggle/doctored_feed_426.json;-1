        "First in a series. You can read Part 2 here. When things heat up, they expand. And when that thing is the axle shaft to your drive train, you\u2019re going to have to make adjustments, or else. Michael Guarraia kneels down next to a metal part that just popped off the rear axle. \u201dOK guys, listen up,\u201d he tells his team. \u201dThe drive train broke again and we need to find a sustainable solution.

This fall, 60 guests will get to attend such a party at the Montalvo Arts Center, a villa in Saratoga, Calif. Chefs David Kinch, Corey Lee and Daniel Patterson \u2014 all of whom run restaurants \u2014 will be preparing a strange, scrumptious meal to boggle the senses, at an event organized by Steinbeisser, an group that organizes \u201dexperimental\u201d culinary experiences.",
        "In 1977, Deborah Barsel, a bored assistant registrar at the George Eastman Museum in Rochester, N. Y. decided to try a fun side project. She would create a cookbook made up of recipes and images from famous photographers of the day. She sent letters to various artists and put an ad in the museum\u2019s magazine asking for submissions.",
        "For a man once accused of forming every sentence with a noun, a verb and it was a serious omission. Rudolph Giuliani appeared to forget the terrorist attack on Sept. 11, 2001, while warming up a crowd for Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy speech on Monday. \u201dBy the way,\u201d Giuliani said, \u201dunder those eight years, before Obama came along, we didn\u2019t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack in the United States.",
        "Fifteen prisoners at Guantanamo Bay have been transferred to the United Arab Emirates \u2014 the largest single release of the Obama administration. The population of the military prison in Cuba is now down to 61. President Obama has long vowed to close Guantanamo, but efforts to transfer prisoners to the U. S. have been blocked by Congress. As a result, any release must be coordinated with another country. That poses a particular challenge for detainees from places like Yemen, where the U. S.",

Ho\u2019s case is one of a number involving scientists the U. S. government suspects may also be spies. The scientists in question are all American citizens they were all born in mainland China or Taiwan. That set of facts has raised questions about whether the Justice Department is targeting people because of their ethnicity.",
        "Buried in the fine print of many marketplace health plan documents is language that allows them to refuse to cover a range of services that are used more often by women, a study finds. It\u2019s unclear if these exclusions have prevented patients from getting needed treatments. An insurance industry representative says patients are generally able to get care if it\u2019s appropriate for them. Yet some women with a family history of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, for instance, may have gaps in care because of the exclusions.",
        "The scene: A quaint and placid college campus, circa 1989. In the student union sits a freshman. Her bangs are crispy from years of chemical encrustation, a . Ecuadorian wool sweater is itching her neck, and there might be a Monet poster on the wall back in her dorm room. She\u2019s reading the \u201dalternative\u201d weekly paper from the big city up the road, and she\u2019s just not too sure about Lynda Barry.

        "Technologies disappear all the time. Last year, an Indian company that was considered the last recycler of cathode ray tubes from those old bulky TVs quietly stopped recycling the CRT glass into new tube televisions. This year, BlackBerry discontinued its last model featuring the the original signature plastic keyboard. This month, the final maker of VCRs in Japan will cease production. Some technologies slowly fade into obsolescence (think phone booths or typewriters) while others go quickly, in a relative sense (floppy disks anyone? ). But some, despite archaism, persist.",
        "Fu Yuanhui, a Chinese swimmer at the Rio Olympics, made headlines this week for telling the world she was on her period. On Sunday, when she finished fourth in the women\u2019s 4x100 meter medley relay, an interviewer found her doubled over and grimacing. She asked Fu if she was in pain. \u201dActually, my period started last night, so I\u2019m feeling pretty weak and really tired,\u201d Fu told the interviewer in Mandarin, according to an video on Shanghai Expat\u2019s YouTube channel. \u201dBut this isn\u2019t an excuse.",
        "fans and journalists thronged China\u2019s newly minted Olympic sensation, swimmer Fu Yuanhui, at the Beijing airport on Tuesday. Her return from Rio was not triumphant because of the bronze medal she won, but because of the Olympic spirit she showed \u2014 and the dramatically new and different vision of sports and athletes that she suggested to a country in transition away from decades of a sports system. Fu, a resident of eastern Hangzhou city, became famous practically overnight, thanks to a CCTV5 interview after she qualified for the backstroke final last week.",
        "In a report on Monday, Human Rights Watch described a harrowing series of events that took place less than a mile from a U. N. base in South Sudan\u2019s capital, Juba. On July 11, the report said, dozens of men in government uniforms \u201dransacked and looted\u201d a hotel compound, first killing a South Sudanese journalist and then assaulting and raping aid workers staying there. Among them was Jesse Bunch, a private contractor, who was hiding in a room with several other Westerners and was shot through a door in the leg.",
        "Even as thousands of residents of southern Louisiana are returning to their homes, more danger could lie ahead as rain continues to fall and the full extent of the damage can\u2019t be known, according to state emergency response officials. Preliminary casualty and damage reports are chilling. As we reported previously, 11 people are confirmed dead, 30, 000 people were evacuated, and about 40, 000 homes were damaged. And those are just preliminary numbers based on reports from 20 affected parishes, said Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor\u2019s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness.",
        "How do you move a lighthouse across a river? Very slowly. For 60 years, the Port Clinton Lighthouse sat in a private marina on the Portage River, moved from its original spot on Lake Erie. One of the only remaining wooden lighthouses on the Great Lakes, the structure deteriorated over the years. But five years ago, a group of conservationists began to restore the lighthouse.

The mysterious group has seized the attention of the cybersecurity world with its claim to have stolen code from the Equation Group \u2014 a team of hackers who have been tied to the National Security Agency. On a website written in broken English, the Shadow Brokers revealed some files and promised \u201dbetter\u201d ones available, for sale to the highest bidder.

        "Once people realized that opioid drugs could cause addiction and deadly overdoses, they tried to use newer forms of opioids to treat the addiction to its parent. Morphine, about 10 times the strength of opium, was used to curb opium cravings in the early 19th century. Codeine, too, was touted as a nonaddictive drug for pain relief, as was heroin. Those attempts were doomed to failure because all opioid drugs interact with the brain in the same way. They dock to a specific neural receptor, the receptor, which controls the effects of pleasure, pain relief and need.",
        "The U. S. Department of Transportation released a statistic on Wednesday that should surprise no one who flies: In the first six months of the year, nearly 1 in every 5 flights was delayed. Flights can be delayed for reasons ranging from bad weather to mechanical problems, but airlines know delays are a problem. Sarah, a corporate training professional based in Texas, is a frequent flier and writes the travel blog Road Warriorette.

        "Larry Wilmore isn\u2019t sure why his program The Nightly Show failed to connect with viewers strongly enough to survive. But he\u2019s pretty skeptical of one notion: That America couldn\u2019t handle a black host leading a late night talk show. \u201dI\u2019ll do jabs and make jokes [about that] but no . .. I don\u2019t think the color of a host affects the viewers like that,\u201d he says. \u201dIs it a mainstream show in the vein of [NBC\u2019s Jimmy] Fallon or [ABC\u2019s Jimmy] Kimmel? No, it\u2019s not.",
        "Science and politics do not always make great bedfellows. It\u2019s a topic we have explored a lot here at 13. 7. As the past few decades have shown, science and technology have a potent power for rapidly shaping culture, for both good and ill. Unfortunately, our ability to deal with that power \u2014 and, as well, its complexity \u2014 has eroded. It\u2019s no surprise then that this election seems to be lacking in real discussions about policies surrounding scientific and technological issues.",

        "It\u2019s increasingly clear that bad experiences during childhood are associated with health effects, including higher rates of heart disease, diabetes and depression. And childhood abuse in particular has been associated with psychiatric problems and chronic diseases years down the line. But whether that translates to a higher risk of early death for abuse survivors isn\u2019t well studied. According to research published Wednesday, there is an association between reports of childhood abuse and premature death, but only in women. And because of the nature of the study, the link isn\u2019t definitive.",
        "Somaliland doesn\u2019t have any embassies around the world. Its passport isn\u2019t accepted in any country. It\u2019s a republic, population 3. 5 million, that broke away from Somalia in 1991, and it\u2019s never received official recognition. But it does have an annual book fair \u2014 and the event, held in late July this year, is more than just a gathering for authors, academics and others to discuss their latest work. It\u2019s also a way to promote the written language of Somali, which wasn\u2019t granted official status until 1972.",
        "Police visited the athletes\u2019 village in Rio Wednesday, hoping to seize the passports of Ryan Lochte and James Feigen as part of an inquiry into Lochte\u2019s report that he was the victim of a robbery \u2014 a crime that has since been called into question.
