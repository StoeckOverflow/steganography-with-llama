        "The fight against the Zika virus has a new weapon: the genetically engineered mosquito. It\u2019s recently been approved by federal regulators and may soon be available in parts of the U. S. that are confronting the virus, like Puerto Rico and Miami. The Florida Keys do not have a Zika problem at the moment, but on Aug. 5 the Food and Drug Administration approved trial releases of these mosquitoes in the Keys.",
        "This is the second story in a series. Read Part 1 here. For the annual Kinetic Sculpture Race in Baltimore, teams must drive, pedal and push their vehicles through 15 miles of roads, mud, sand and water. students at Arbutus Middle School have been working after school for months on their entry: a huge sculpture called Monsters of the Middle School Brain. They\u2019re learning a lot \u2014 about design and engineering but also about working together as a team. They say the main challenges they face are stamina, teamwork and thinking creatively.",
        "Julian Assange says if the United States government sees him as a threat to national security, it should see Hillary Clinton as one, too. In an interview with Morning Edition\u2019s David Greene, the founder of WikiLeaks called the Department of Justice\u2019s decision not to prosecute Clinton for handling classified information on her private email server an \u201dincredible double standard.\u201d Assange has been living in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London for four years to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning on suspicion of rape.",
        "The FBI has shared secret documents from its investigation of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton with members of Congress, fulfilling at least in part a promise the bureau\u2019s director made last month. A spokeswoman for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee confirmed the panel had received \u201da number of documents\u201d from federal investigators Tuesday afternoon. \u201dCommittee staff is currently reviewing the information that is classified SECRET,\u201d the spokeswoman said.",
        "A widely criticized refugee detention camp on Manus Island will be shut down, Papua New Guinea and Australia announced Wednesday. They have not set a timetable for the closure or announced what will happen to the 850 men currently detained in the camp, The Associated Press reports. Australia\u2019s policy on migrants and refugees is strict: attempting to reach Australia by boat are intercepted at sea, and officials say they will never be allowed to settle in the country. That\u2019s true even if authorities determine them to be refugees who would qualify for asylum.",
        "For the first half of the 20th century, nobody would have ever compared the wines of California\u2019s Napa Valley to the great wines of France. \u201dIt\u2019s amazing when you think about it,\u201d says Amy Azzarito, online strategist at the University of California, Davis, library. \u201dCalifornia wines were a joke for a long time. And they\u2019re not anymore.\u201d UC Davis and a man named Maynard Amerine are two central reasons for that turnaround.",
        "Major changes would come to the Clinton Foundation if Hillary Clinton is elected president this fall. Bill Clinton would step down from the foundation board and it would stop accepting money from foreign and corporate sources, the former president told staff on Thursday. Information on the possible role of Chelsea Clinton in the foundation was not available. The Clinton Foundation confirmed to NPR these details, which were originally reported by the Associated Press. The Clinton Global Initiative will also be shut down next month.",
        "Barring a banana peel appearing in his lane, the Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt will likely win a third straight gold medal in the 200 meters today, at the Rio Olympics. Earlier this week, Bolt, who turns 30 at the conclusion of the games, on Sunday, picked up his third gold in the 100 meters, after smiling his way through qualifying heats with characteristic charm and seeming ease.",
        "An August presidential poll out of Virginia shows the heightening of a trend: There is a big, big split in the battleground state. The rural southwest area is heavily in favor of Donald Trump, the Washington News poll found, while the DC suburbs are by far Clinton country. And this divide persists nationwide. Hillary Clinton led Trump by 26 points in urban areas in a recent poll, also from the Washington Post. But in rural areas, Trump led Clinton by 20 points.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s increasingly dominant lead in the presidential race is solidifying many Republicans\u2019 worst 2016 fears that Donald Trump will cost the party not only the White House but also control of the Senate. \u201dThe bottom is starting to fall out a little earlier than expected,\u201d says a top Senate GOP campaign aide who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the state of the race. \u201dWe started off with a very difficult map. No matter what, this was going to be a very difficult year.\u201d The aide says Trump\u2019s ailing campaign is an additional drag on the Senate battlefield.",
        "Standing before several dozen students in a college classroom, Travis Rieder tries to convince them not to have children. Or at least not too many. He\u2019s at James Madison University in southwest Virginia to talk about a \u201d ethic\u201d \u2014 to question the assumptions of a society that sees having children as good, throws parties for expecting parents, and in which parents then pressure their kids to \u201dgive them grandchildren.\u201d Why question such assumptions? The prospect of climate catastrophe.",
        "It was a team that ran alone: The women of the U. S. relay team raced by themselves under the lights of Rio\u2019s Olympic Stadium Thursday, going against the clock for a shot at the final. The team of Tianna Bartoletta, Allyson Felix, English Gardner and Morolake Akinosun needed a time better than 42. 70 seconds to reach the final.

        "When rancher Cliven Bundy claimed his family of Mormon pioneers had \u201dancestral\u201d rights to the federal land in and around Gold Butte, Nev. Vernon Lee scoffed. \u201dAs a native, and as the tribe that actually had that land granted by the federal government back in the 1800s, he really doesn\u2019t got a right at all,\u201d Lee says. \u201dIf anybody\u2019s got a right it would be the Moapa Band of Paiutes.\u201d Lee, who is a former tribal councilman, is sitting on a lawn chair in the shade of his mobile home on the Moapa River Reservation.",
        "We should have been prepared for the Ryan Lochte drama in Rio. We\u2019ve seen this reality show before. Or at least we could have, if we were paying very close attention to the E! television channel back in 2013. After Lochte\u2019s strong showing at the London Olympics in 2012, which included five medals, the swimmer and E! teamed up for a reality show called What Would Ryan Do? It offered an intimate look at his process under the influence of tequila shots, bright lights and lots of young women, all while not wearing a shirt.",

S. swimmers who claimed to have been held up at gun point during their time at the Summer Olympics. Speaking Thursday at a news conference about the robbery that was reported by decorated U. S. swimmer Ryan Lochte, Veloso said that Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger, two of Lochte\u2019s teammates who were with him on the night in question, have now confirmed that the robbery story was a fabrication.

        "Although Family Circle magazine\u2019s quadrennial presidential cookie competition sounds like it might have started with Mamie Eisenhower back in the 1950s, it actually got its start with Hillary Clinton. Every presidential election cycle since 1992, the magazine has published a cookie recipe from the candidates\u2019 wives. The latest recipes were released Thursday morning, of course with a twist this year: Since Hillary Clinton is the first female nominee of a major party, it was her husband, Bill, who was asked to furnish a cookie recipe, along with Melania Trump. The Clintons don\u2019t exactly win points for creativity this year.",
        "Donald Trump often questions whether Hillary Clinton is honest or trustworthy enough to be president. This week, he took up another line of attack: that Clinton is in failing health. Claims about Clinton\u2019s health have circulated for years but have gained new traction recently, in part thanks to a comment by Trump and questions raised by Fox News host Sean Hannity. They\u2019re adding fuel to an online volley of conspiracy theories saying that Clinton\u2019s use of stools and pillows as well as stumbles by the candidate are evidence that she is in poor health.",

They met when Weir was 17 and Garcia was an 22. For three decades, they\u2019d perfected a tandem that provided the essence of the Grateful Dead sound.",
        "Some of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance marketplaces are in turmoil as the fourth open enrollment season approaches this fall. What\u2019s ahead for consumers depends very much on where they live. Competition on some exchanges will be diminished next year when three of the nation\u2019s largest health insurers \u2014 Aetna, UnitedHealthcare and Humana \u2014 will sell individual plans in many fewer markets. The departure of several Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in various states will also hurt. These pullbacks also come on top of the closure of 16 nonprofit another coverage option, since January 2015.",
        "Contact lenses are so ubiquitous \u2014 about 41 million people in the U. S. wear them \u2014 that it\u2019s easy to forget that they\u2019re actual medical devices, with small but real medical risks. An analysis published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention examined 1, 075 reports of corneal infections related to contact lens use from the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Medical Device Report database over a decade. To be sure, these were likely the worst of the worst of these types of infection and can\u2019t be considered representative of contact lens infections overall.",
        "U. S. Justice Department officials plan to phase out their use of private prisons to house federal inmates, reasoning that the contract facilities offer few benefits for public safety or taxpayers. In making the decision, Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates cited new findings by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general, who concluded earlier this month that a pool of 14 privately contracted prisons reported more incidents of inmate contraband, higher rates of assaults and more uses of force than facilities run by the Federal Bureau of Prisons.",
        "In the fall of 2010, months after a devastating earthquake struck Haiti, a new disaster began: a cholera outbreak that killed thousands of people and continues to sicken people across the country. Experts determined that the source of the disease was a U. N. peacekeeping camp. And now, nearly six years later, the United Nations has admitted it played some role in the deadly outbreak. At a briefing Thursday, U. N. spokesman Farhan Haq said that over the course of the past year, \u201dthe U. N.",
        "Not quite 10 months after Haiti\u2019s devastating 2010 earthquake, a more insidious disaster struck: cholera. Haiti hadn\u2019t seen cholera for at least a century. Then suddenly, the first cases appeared in the central highlands near a camp for United Nations peacekeeping forces. Since then the disease has struck 1 out of every 16 Haitians \u2014 nearly 640, 000 people. It has killed 8, 000. The disease struck with explosive force. Within two days of the first cases, a hospital 60 miles away was admitting a new cholera patient every 3 minutes.",
        "Surrounded by shouting, he\u2019s completely silent. The child is small, alone, covered in blood and dust, dropped in the back of an ambulance with his feet dangling off the edge of a chair. He doesn\u2019t cry or speak. His face is stunned and dazed, but not surprised. He wipes his hand over his wounded face, looks at the blood, wipes it off on the chair. And he stares. The world is staring back.",
        "This is the conclusion of our series. Read Part 1 here and Part 2 here. May 7: Race Day, Today is the day! For eight months, two dozen students at Arbutus Middle School in suburban Maryland have been designing and building a car with a giant human brain on top.

        "People, I have noticed, get very excited about eating pigs and pig products. Bacon mania has been going for a while now, and the cult of barbecue continues as strong as ever. At the same time, the movement includes the idea that it\u2019s ethical and healthy to pay attention to where and how animals are raised for slaughter.",
        "hot dogs and hamburgers may come with an unusual ingredient: seaweed. That\u2019s the goal of a group of scientists trying to make these unhealthful foods more healthful by adding seaweed, a staple in Japanese and other Asian cuisines. But it\u2019s still early days of research. The team has been exploring what happens to the taste, texture and smell of meat products when they replace some of the fat and salt content with dried and powdered seaweed. They summarize their progress in a report published last month in the journal Food Research International.",
        "Can one photo help end a war? That\u2019s what people are wondering about the image of a little Syrian boy covered head to toe in a thick layer of dust, his face bloodied, as he sits in a bright orange chair. His name is Omran Daqneesh and he\u2019s 5. On Wednesday, he was rescued from a building in Aleppo hit by an air strike.
