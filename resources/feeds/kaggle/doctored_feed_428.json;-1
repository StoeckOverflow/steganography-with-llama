        "In an effort to save his flagging presidential candidacy, and two days after shaking up his campaign, Donald Trump expressed \u201dregret\u201d for sometimes saying the wrong thing and causing \u201dpain.\u201d \u201dSometimes, in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don\u2019t choose the right words or you say the wrong thing,\u201d Trump said, reading from a teleprompter at a campaign event Thursday night in Charlotte, N. C. \u201dI have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain.",

        "For Gawker Media\u2019s websites to live, Gawker. com, the actual namesake website, has to die. It will be shut down next week by its new owner, a victim of its own poisoned legacy. Any obituary should start by acknowledging the good the subject rendered to the world. There\u2019s no reason not to do that here, other than the extent to which that impulse might appall some of Gawker\u2019s own writers were it a piece about the demise of another publication.",
        "When scientists tallied the temperature readings from around the world last month, this is what they discovered: \u201dJuly, 2016 was the warmest month we have observed in our period of record that dates back to 1880,\u201d says Jake Crouch, a climate scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. And July wasn\u2019t a freak occurrence, he notes. The past 10 years have seen numerous high temperature records. The temperature record for July is an average for the planet, Crouch explains. Some places were a bit cooler than normal \u2014 Siberia, for example. But other places were incredibly hot.",
        "The U. S. women\u2019s water polo team dominated Italy in a win in their gold medal match Friday to become the first women\u2019s team to win gold at consecutive Summer Olympics. It\u2019s the most goals ever scored in a women\u2019s water polo final, and the widest margin of victory, according to the Olympic News Service. The American team scored four goals in two different periods \u2014 the first and the third \u2014 and while Italy fought its way back to trail at the half, the U.

        "This week, in a tale of Olympic scandal and intrigue, Ryan Lochte is in the spotlight for an ugly encounter at a gas station in Rio de Janeiro. To give a quick recap: Lochte, a U. S. swimmer who has competed in the last three Olympic games, told the press earlier this week that he and some of his teammates had been robbed at gunpoint in Rio de Janeiro early Sunday morning. Police reports, security footage, and testimony from witnesses contradict Lochte\u2019s original statement.",

        "A samurai film \u2014 that\u2019s the germ of an idea that grew into the sprawling fantasy film, Kubo and the Two Strings. It\u2019s a epic set in fantasy Japan about a young storyteller who makes magic with music and origami paper. The film stars Art Parkinson as Kubo, the Samurai\u2019s son, as well as Charlize Theron, Ralph Fiennes, Rooney Mara, George Takei and Matthew McConaughey.

        "As part of a lawsuit against U. S. Customs and Border Protection, new images from surveillance video have been released to the public that show detained immigrants crowded into cramped concrete holding cells in Arizona. Lawyers arguing on behalf of detained immigrants said the images help prove allegations that the use of the holding cells is unconstitutional, and The Arizona Republic newspaper stepped in to request that the images be released to the public. The U. S.",
        "At about 8 a. m. ET today, far above Earth, astronaut Jeff Williams floated out a hatch and then welcomed Kate Rubins into the void. \u201dOK Kate, come on out,\u201d said Williams. \u201dOK, copy,\u201d said Rubins. And with that, the two Americans began a assignment to install a new docking port to the International Space Station. Here\u2019s how they did it: Since 2011, when NASA retired its space shuttles, the government has paid the Russian space agency to rocket astronauts to the space station \u2014 at a cost of about $80 million per seat.",
        "The wait for a new Frank Ocean album is over \u2014 sort of. Late Thursday night, the reclusive singer unveiled Endless, a starkly minimal multimedia project that does indeed feature new music, but leaves many other questions unanswered. With listeners everywhere processing Ocean\u2019s latest creation in real time, we asked our NPR Music\u2019s Jason King and Ann Powers to share their first impressions. Jason fired the first volley: Hear his chat with All Things Considered at the audio link, and read on for his discussion with Ann.",

        "Scandal? Juda Engelmayer\u2019s seen his share of corporate scandals: \u201dFailures, lawsuits, arrest, financial breakdowns, tainted food.\u201d All things he\u2019s handled as head of crisis communications for 5W Public Relations. It\u2019s no fun, he says, dethroning a titan over a big mistake. \u201dTrying to counsel a client who\u2019s done something wrong and trying to convince them that, A. they\u2019ve done something wrong, and B. to come out and say it to the public that\u2019s loved them and adored them for a long time \u2014 not easy to do,\u201d he says.",
        "When you stop to think about it, there really is no one like Barbra Streisand. There\u2019s Barbra the young Broadway legend, the movie star, the movie director, the recording artist and now the venerated elder stateswoman of the showstopper. But amid all the richly deserved Oscars, Tonys, Emmys and Globes, there\u2019s that voice. Forget all her other talents, it\u2019s the voice alone that any entertainer would die to possess. Last night, Streisand gave a plus concert at Washington, D. C.\u2019s Verizon Center.",
        "It is a remarkable fact that we treat men and women, boys and girls, differently. I\u2019m not talking about wage disparities and implicit bias. No, I mean that we openly and freely treat males and females as if they were simply different kinds of people. A few examples of what I have in mind: All this is widespread and commonplace.",

        "In such comedies as Pineapple Express and The Hangover, guys get incredibly wasted, do phenomenally stupid stuff, stumble into spectacular trouble, and yet somehow emerge relatively unscathed. Of course, scenarios like that don\u2019t play out in the real world. Except that they do, according to War Dogs, an amusing if underachieving farce based on the escapades of two twentysomething gunrunners. Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz are the actual names of actual people, who went from attending an Orthodox synagogue in Miami Beach to brokering surplus Cold ammo in Albania.",
        "The human papillomavirus vaccine is the only vaccine invented explicitly for the purpose of preventing cancer. Yet a decade after its approval, the vaccine continues to struggle from a PR problem, as shown in a study that finds just one in five parents would support making the HPV vaccine a requirement for school. But this first national study of parents\u2019 attitudes found that those attitudes shifted if the requirement allowed parents an opportunity to opt out.",
        "As Hillary Clinton began a meeting with police chiefs from departments around the country, she expressed gratitude to those on the force. \u201dThey represent officers who get up every day, put on their uniforms, kiss their families goodbye and risk their lives on behalf of our communities,\u201d the Democratic nominee said at the Thursday gathering in New York City. During the brief part of the meeting that was open to reporters, Clinton referenced Dallas, where five police officers were shot and killed in July. She also talked about Baton Rouge, La.",
        "Many efforts to address the food waste crisis hinge on getting consumers to buy fruits and vegetables that are adorably ugly \u2014 the bumpy tomato, the bulbous carrot, the dinged apple. Taste and nutritional value aren\u2019t compromised by their irregular appearance. Still, many stores discount blemished produce \u2014 a concession to convention aimed at keeping the product moving briskly off the shelves and away from landfills. Earlier this summer, launched an ugly apple pilot program at 300 of its outlets in Florida grocery stores across the U. K.",
        "Garrison Institute looks a little like Hogwarts. The retreat center is housed in a former monastery amid tranquil green hills overlooking the Hudson River, 60 miles north and a world away from New York City. Inside the airy chapel on a recent summer afternoon, about 35 educators from the U. S. and at least five foreign countries are seated quietly, shoes off. \u201dJust notice your breath, the sensation of your air coming in, going out,\u201d says Christa Turksma, a Dutch woman dressed all in white with hair.",
        "The little boy in Aleppo, sitting in an ambulance, his face caked with rubble and blood, is named Omran Daqneesh. He is five years old. His home was destroyed on Wednesday night. Russian and Syrian government airstrikes have become routine in areas of the city. And rebels have also shelled the side. Omran\u2019s legs barely reach to the edge of the seat.

        "It won\u2019t take the sting of a World Cup shellacking away, but it\u2019ll help: Brazil beat Germany in Olympic soccer Saturday, in a win that earns the men\u2019s team their first gold medal. Brazilian star Neymar opened the scoring midway through the first half, bending a beautiful free kick over the wall of defenders and toward the net \u2014 where it clipped the underside of the crossbar and eluded German goalie Timo Horn. Asked after the game to describe his feelings, Neymar said, \u201dI can\u2019t begin to describe them.",
        "\u201dRyan Lochte is too much with us,\u201d William Wordsworth might have written if he were covering the Summer Olympics in Rio. Okay, I admit it: William Wordsworth would never have written that. But that\u2019s the sentiment that hung over Rio this week, as the temporary community that the Olympics creates every two years found itself unexpectedly distracted from its normal duty of watching talented and dedicated people introduce their dreams to Olympic reality. Part of the allure of the Olympic Games is that they move at a steady pace.",
        "The U. S. women\u2019s basketball team trounced Spain, on Saturday, winning their sixth consecutive gold and their 49th straight Olympic game. The American women so overpowered their opponents that the tournament was almost certainly the least competitive event at the Rio games, which end on Sunday. The average margin of victory for the U. S. in their Olympic games was nearly 40 points, and the closest game was a victory over France in the semifinals. Since 1996, the American have only had one game where they won by fewer than 10 points. In the gold medal game, the U.",

And as of this weekend, it\u2019s open to visitors. Now, one can walk the length of the glass bridge, which is positioned a 328 yards above the ground, as China\u2019s news agency Xinhua reported. The bridge is located in the Zhangjiajie National Forest, where the otherworldly, plummeting mountain faces reportedly provided inspiration for the forest setting in the film Avatar. \u201dI wanted to feel by this bridge."
