        "Security experts say that Russian hackers have broken into the computers of not only the Democratic National Committee but other targets as well. This has raised a new wave of concerns that on Election Day, the votes themselves could be compromised by hackers, potentially tipping the results. Most states have returned to voting systems in recent years, but that still leaves vulnerable a number of states that rely solely on machines.",
        "The massive container ships that ply the high seas bring us pineapples and mangoes in winter, and computers and cheap all year round. But the shipping industry is a volatile, cyclical and ferociously competitive business. There are good years and bad years. And then there\u2019s this year. \u201dThis is likely to be one of the worst years ever in terms of losses,\u201d says Janet Porter, of containers at Lloyd\u2019s List, a shipping industry news provider. She says over the years, global shipping companies got used to growth of 6, 7 or 8 percent.",

        "For voters dissatisfied with both major party candidates, there are a few other options. There\u2019s Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, and a lesser known late arrival to the scene \u2014 Evan McMullin. McMullin is running as an independent with support from the #NeverTrump movement. He has been a vocal critic of Donald Trump \u2014 and he\u2019s seen as a conservative alternative to the candidate.

        "Bill Clinton turned 70 on Friday. From his small town beginnings in Arkansas to the Oval Office in Washington, Clinton\u2019s career has been anything but a smooth ride. It could be tested again if his wife, Hillary Clinton, is elected president \u2014 becoming the first presidential spouse to be elected president in their own right. Nothing has represented Clinton\u2019s legacy more than the Clinton foundation, but questions about potential conflicts of interest \u2014 as well as Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server \u2014 have been a nagging thorn in the side of Clinton\u2019s presidential run.",
        "It took Bill Broun 14 years to write Night of the Animals. But the novel, Broun\u2019s debut, has still proved remarkably timely in a summer of \u201dBrexit\u201d anxieties. The book depicts a dark future in which the European Union has dissolved and the U. K. has become a pacified surveillance state. Between \u201dindigents\u201d and \u201dthe new aristocracy,\u201d a vanishing middle class bows beneath abundant chocolate, lager, legal hallucinogens and electronics. In the middle of it all, the London Zoo stands as a kind of ark for all the species who are being driven out of existence.",
        "When Scott Gatz and his husband decided to become fathers several years ago, pursuing parenthood meant finding both an egg donor and a surrogate to help them conceive a baby.

        "The water vole \u2014 once a common creature in the British countryside \u2014 hasn\u2019t been seen in the U. K.\u2019s Yorkshire Dales for more than 50 years. But starting this weekend, the endangered animals might be making a comeback. Arvicola amphibious has a fine literary pedigree: In The Wind in the Willows, \u201dRatty\u201d was in fact a water vole. The rodents were once in abundance in the Yorkshire Dales but have been eradicated by industrialization. Blame minks, too. Ecologists believe that the predatory critters, escaped from fur farms, devastated vole populations.",
        "On a blisteringly hot day at the state fairgrounds in Skowhegan, Maine, Kathy Savoie takes some local blueberries and simmers them in a pot. She adds onions, ginger, vinegar, mustard seeds, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, black pepper and salt. And, later, she drops in some calcium water, pectin and sugar for consistency. Clearly, what she calls \u201dsavory blueberry ginger conserve\u201d is not your grandma\u2019s blueberry jam.",

One of the latest entrants into the business is Smell Dating, a New company that asks clients to wear a for three days \u2014 without bathing! \u2014 so swatches of the fabric can be sent to prospective partners. The idea is that folks sniff and, if they like the smell, pursue a date.

        "Rio 2016 organizers dropped the curtain on the Summer Games on Sunday after hosting the world\u2019s elite athletes who\u2019ve competed for 306 medals over the past 19 days here in Rio de Janeiro. The closing ceremony starts at 8 p. m. local time, which is one hour ahead of Eastern Time. Because of NBC\u2019s time delay, it\u2019s airing at 8 p. m. ET and progressively later across the U. S. We\u2019re updating this post with scenes from the event, so please refresh to see what\u2019s happening in Rio.",
        "No one is flying home from Rio with more medals than the U. S. women. The full American squad \u2014 both men and women \u2014 won the most medals overall, 121, as has often been the case in the Summer Games. But first in London four years ago, and again in Rio, the U. S. women have captured most of those medals. The U. S. women took 61, the men had 55, and there were five in mixed events, including equestrian and tennis. How good were the American women? They won 27 of the 46 American golds.",
        "One of the great pleasures of the Olympics is the serendipity \u2014 you never know where the best performances or the worst behavior will come from. We\u2019ve already heard plenty, and deservedly so, about Usain Bolt, Michael Phelps and Simone Biles. And way too much about Ryan Lochte. So as the Rio Games conclude Sunday, let\u2019s look at some other athletes who struck an emotional chord and captured the spirit of the Olympics. Or the opposite of that spirit.",

        "Recently, on a hot summer morning with cumulus clouds towering overhead, black cattle grazed in South Florida fields, dotting the horizon along with clumps of palm trees. At the Big Cypress Reservation, Moses Jumper is a tribal elder and owner of nearly 300 head \u2014 and a cattleman. \u201dA lot of people look at us as wrestlin\u2019 alligators, and the casinos and all that.

        "Lou Pearlman, the impresario behind boy band giants such as the Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC, has died in prison while serving a sentence tied to a $300 million Ponzi scheme. The Federal Bureau of Prisons said Pearlman died Friday, without specifying a cause of death. Along with the Ponzi scheme allegations, Pearlman faced accusations of sexual misconduct against numerous young boy band members, first detailed in a 2007 Vanity Fair article. \u201dSome, especially the teenagers, shrugged and giggled when he showed them pornographic movies or jumped naked on their beds in the morning to wrestle and play.",

Here, in a cluttered shop from a bygone era, Jacques Guillaume has been repairing electric razors since 1962.

        "Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both had a second month of strong fundraising in July, the month that they claimed their parties\u2019 nominations. In monthly reports filed Saturday night with the Federal Election Commission, Trump reported raising $36. 7 million, his best month of the campaign. The total includes $2 million he contributed in a matching contributions drive.

        "One glaring reality of Election 2016 is the lingering and extremely high unpopularity of the Republican and Democratic Party nominees. A recent Fox News poll found that both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are disliked by more voters than they are liked. And it\u2019s been this way for a while. As we and many other news outlets have previously reported, Trump and Clinton are the most unliked presidential candidates in recent history.",
        "Sounds like the usual narrative of sports events: the long hours of training and complete devotion, the expectation of results that may define new records or new ways of looking ahead, the excitement preceding the meet. Then, when the time comes, it can be total frustration or glory. Equipment failure, miscalculations, human error or triumph, new heights achieved, new horizons revealed, old records broken. There is a herolike narrative in science that, perhaps surprisingly, is not that far from a sports narrative.",
        "Evan Mawarire, a Zimbabwean clergyman, rose to prominence in the spring, when he draped the national flag around his shoulders and took to YouTube to call for change in his country, which has been ruled for more than three decades by President Robert Mugabe and is beset by chronic economic problems. \u201dThis flag, every day that it flies, is begging for you to get involved, to say something, to cry out and say, \u2019Why must we be in this situation?\u2019 \u201d he said in the video. It went viral and sparked a movement hashtagged #ThisFlag on social media.",
        "Donald Trump addressed a crowd in Fredericksburg, Va. on Saturday night, and discussed one of the new features apparent in his campaign. \u201dIn recent days, across this country, I\u2019ve asked the community to honor me with their vote,\u201d Trump said. \u201dI fully recognize that outreach to the community is an area where the Republican Party must do better.\u201d The need for better outreach by the Republican Party and its nominee to has been underscored as Trumpmade this point in recent days to the overwhelmingly white crowds that show up to his rallies.",

        "Look, I am solidly a kind of genre nerd. Never been much for fantasy done after the 1970s (it mostly sounds like bad Tolkien). Never cared much for ghost stories or alternate histories or love stories or horror. Which is why, on the surface, it might seem odd that I was so thoroughly taken in by Mary Robinette Kowal\u2019s newest novel, Ghost Talkers. I mean, it\u2019s essentially an alternate history love story with ghosts in it. Lots and lots of ghosts. And therefore falls firmly into that sprawling pile of Stuff I Wouldn\u2019t Read On A Bet.",
        "In an amateur video, four frightened men, stripped to the waist and tethered to a truck, are publicly flogged on a busy street in broad daylight.

        "One of the most surprising stories of the Olympics, which end on Sunday, was the unseeded Monica Puig\u2019s improbable march to the gold medal in women\u2019s singles tennis. Puig\u2019s win captured Puerto Rico\u2019s gold medal in the Olympics and set off massive celebrations across the island. It was a deal. Hold up, you might be thinking. Why does Puerto Rico have its own Olympic delegation? Aren\u2019t Puerto Ricans considered American citizens? The answers to those questions are layered and fascinating, as I learned when I sat down to talk with Antonio Sotomayor, a professor at the University of .",
        "Editor\u2019s Note: The photos in this story may be distressing to some viewers. Rodrigo Duterte, the new president of the Philippines, campaigned as a candidate, threatening death for drug dealers. And in the seven weeks since he took office, nearly 1, 800 alleged criminals have died \u2014 at the hands of police or under mysterious circumstances. The wave of extrajudicial killings has prompted outcry from human rights watchdogs, the Catholic Church and the United Nations. Now the Philippine Senate is investigating the deaths. Observers believed there had been hundreds."
