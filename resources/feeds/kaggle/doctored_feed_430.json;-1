        "The headline of a recent NPR\u2019s story about Omran Daqneesh, a little Syrian boy who was rescued in Aleppo, asked: \u201dCan One Photo End A War?\u201d This \u201done photo\u201d may not end a war tomorrow, but it has made me aware of the devastation happening every second in Syria. And it has prompted me to take action to help end the war today. Just a few days ago, I did not know the extent of the war in Syria. I had to Google \u201dAleppo,\u201d \u201dSyrian refugees,\u201d \u201dwhat can we do,\u201d and so on.",
        "When a erratic wildfire ignites, firefighters right away try to save homes and steer the flames away from life and property. But experts say the real danger often occurs in the hours after the big wall of flames rips through. That\u2019s how the home of Rodrigo Moraga, a volunteer firefighter in Colorado, caught on fire. In 2010, he was one of the first responders to a wildfire racing through a canyon outside Boulder. As the main flanks of that fire moved on toward a small town, he ordered all available engines to follow it.",
        "Ah, rum, with its legendary pirates bellowing for grog, tiki umbrellas peeking up from cocktails, punch at college parties. Rum, universally imbibed and yet often scorned. Most rum is \u201dthe distilled essence of industrial waste,\u201d in the words of Wayne Curtis, author of And a Bottle of Rum: A History of the New World in Ten Cocktails. That waste is molasses, the byproduct of sugar production. After the molasses has been fermented, flavorings, colorings and sugar are often added in.",
        "There\u2019s brutal honesty in the songs of Margaret Glaspy that can make them feel cold, but they\u2019re also heartfelt. That\u2019s part of what makes Glaspy a top new artist of 2016 for many of the writers here at NPR Music. Glaspy\u2019s new album Emotions And Math, made with her band, is a huge leap from her earlier EPs Homeschool (2012) and If When (2013) which mostly consisted of the singer and her electric guitar.",
        "Snidely Whiplash may have been famous for yelling, \u201dCurses, foiled again!\u201d And those \u201dmeddling kids\u201d have spoiled many a villainous plot. But sometimes, good doesn\u2019t win the day. Sometimes the bad guys get away with it. And if we\u2019re going to talk about villains, let\u2019s talk about the biggest of the Big Bads, the of Ghouls, the Imperator of Iniquity \u2014 Satan himself. Specifically, the version of Satan set down by John Milton in Paradise Lost. Like a lot of kids, I first encountered Milton\u2019s Satan in high school English class.",
        "Over the weekend we asked Ann Powers and Jason King to wrestle with Frank Ocean\u2019s to 2012\u2019s Channel Orange. They did so across many time zones and man hours what emerged is a conversation that stays and grounded and ends in questioning both the artist and his audience. We find it impossible and personally limiting to consider this album outside of its context, so the below is as much a state of affairs as it is a review. (Ann Powers and Jason King write about both the physical and digital versions of the album interchangeably.",
        "Many parents who grew up playing outdoors with friends, walking alone to the park or to school, and enjoying other moments of independent play are now raising children in a world with very different norms. In the United States today, leaving children unsupervised is grounds for moral outrage and can lead to criminal charges. What\u2019s changed? One possibility is that the risks to children have changed. What was safe in the past may be unsafe today, placing children in genuine danger. But, for the most part, the data don\u2019t support this.",

So I had to get away from that and now I\u2019m in Prescott, Ariz. ,\u201d Phillip says. NPR agreed not to use his last name because he is struggling with addiction and fears it might hurt his chances of future employment. Phillip and a handful of other young people are filtering through the line at a soup kitchen at the Prescott United Methodist Church just before noon.",
        "Months after the Obama administration advised school districts that transgender students should be given access to bathrooms based on their gender identity, a federal judge in Texas has blocked the guidance from going into effect \u2014 for now.

        "Saying it can\u2019t condone Ryan Lochte\u2019s behavior during Rio\u2019s Summer Olympics, swimwear company Speedo is ending its sponsorship deal with the decorated American swimmer. The announcement comes after Lochte and three other swimmers were caught in an embarrassing episode in which Lochte claimed to have been robbed at gunpoint \u2014 a story that Rio de Janeiro police and U. S. officials found to be a fabrication. Lochte left Brazil before police could seize his passport and question him about his allegations.",
        "Twenty years ago, welfare as Americans knew it ended. President Bill Clinton signed a welfare overhaul bill that limited benefits and encouraged poor people to find jobs. \u201dWe\u2019re going to make it all new again, and see if we can\u2019t create a system of incentives which reinforce work and family and independence,\u201d Clinton said at a White House bill signing ceremony. The goals were admirable: help poor families get into the workforce so they\u2019d no longer need government aid. They\u2019d get job training and support, such as help with child care. But the results have been mixed.",
        "Uber and Lyft are fighting, on the same side, to make sure their drivers remain independent contractors \u2014 not employees entitled to benefits. So far, no court has compelled these companies to change that. But out in the free market, they\u2019re facing an unexpected battle: a new startup that\u2019s prepared to offer drivers full employee status. Juno is not a scrappy, kind of startup. Its headquarters are in the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, 1 World Trade Center, on the 47th floor. There\u2019s a majestic view of the Hudson River.",
        "Is Donald Trump considering wavering on a key campaign promise? That\u2019s what several news reports published over the weekend suggest. And while the Trump campaign issued a statement denying any shift on immigration policy, top surrogates and campaign operatives hinted that a change just might be on its way. The issue: what to do with the estimated 11 million immigrants already living in the United States illegally. Since he entered the presidential race last year, Trump insisted they would have to be expelled from the country, despite the logistical and humanitarian questions a mass deportation would present.",

        "In 1998 Oklahoma became one of only two states to offer universal preschool, and it\u2019s been one of the most closely watched experiments in the country. Today, the vast majority of these programs are in public schools. The rest are run by centers or Head Start, the federally funded education program. Deborah Phillips, a professor of psychology at Georgetown University, has spent more than a decade studying and tracking children in these programs. Her most recent findings were just published in the journal Developmental Psychology.",
        "Everybody eats, which is what makes food a perfect choice to resolve conflicts and foster connections among nations. The concept is called \u201dgastrodiplomacy,\u201d and South Korea is one of its strongest champions. The country is one of the world\u2019s best at branding itself through food, using its cuisine as a kind of \u201dsoft power\u201d to help spread South Korea\u2019s influence.
