So that\u2019a what happened, but don;y think that't the only reason, there was more, and if we told that, then maybe we would tell everything else that's on here too. I know I can write it because I know what it looks like to get a little girl. So we won Just like that.",
        "Early mornings are routine for Hiroyuki Yamamoto. He\u2019s typically at a busy intersection in the city of Matsudo, near Tokyo, where he volunteers as a school crossing guard. But one rainy morning a little over a year ago, an old woman caught his attention. She was pushing a bicycle. She was kind of disheveled. Despite the rain, she didn\u2019t have an umbrella. When Yamamoto spoke to the woman, she said she was trying to get to the city of Kamisuwa. That\u2019s about four hours away by train.",
        "In Japanese cities, space is at a premium. So convenience stores that cram everything from Kleenex to rice balls into a few square yards are everywhere. You can\u2019t walk five minutes in most cities without running into one or two or even half a dozen. But they\u2019re not just a place for Slurpees and snacks. Nearly 27 percent of Japan\u2019s population is now 65 or older, and convenience stores are changing to serve this growing market. Case in point is a Lawson convenience store in the city of Kawaguchi, north of Tokyo.",
        "Like hundreds of thousands of Syrians fleeing the long war back home, Firas Awad endured a dangerous sea journey and a long trek through much of Europe to reach Germany, where he\u2019s staked his future. He and his wife, Tamam Aldrawsha, who are both from the city of Homs, now live in what used to be a country inn and restaurant, in a tiny, forested village north of Berlin called Klosterheide, population 280. asylum seekers moved here last December.

        "Sharon Van Etten has released a new song she wrote in memory of the victims of the June shooting at Orlando\u2019s Pulse nightclub. \u201dNot Myself\u201d is a gorgeous, haunting elegy, with Van Etten\u2019s voice layered over simple piano and a droning synth. \u201dIt\u2019s too much to take,\u201d she sings. \u201dIt\u2019s too much at stake. I want you to be yourself around me.\u201d \u201dI was home with my parents in New Jersey when I heard of the shooting,\u201d Van Etten says in a prepared statement.",
        "More than a century later, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake remains a dramatic, traumatic moment in American history. That makes it the perfect vector for an alternate history novel \u2014 a potential that isn\u2019t lost on Beth Cato. In her latest novel, Breath of Earth, the author casts off from the wholly fabricated fantasy world of her acclaimed steampunk duology, The Clockwork Dagger and The Clockwork Crown. Instead, she sets Breath of Earth at the center \u2014 indeed, the epicenter \u2014 of a version of San Francisco circa 1906. In so many ways, it\u2019s a city on the brink.",
        "Would a President Donald Trump attempt to forcefully remove an estimated 11 million people from the United States? Three days after Trump\u2019s campaign first hinted it was reconsidering walking back from a core campaign promise, the answer still isn\u2019t clear. Trump had long promised to identify and remove the estimated 11 million immigrants already living in the United States illegally. He has called for a \u201ddeportation force\u201d to do this, and notably praised a controversial Eisenhower program called \u201dOperation Wetback,\u201d which deported up to 1. 5 million people from the United States.",

        "The U. S. could rein in rising drug prices by being more selective about giving patents to pharmaceutical companies for marginal developments, a study concludes. That\u2019s because drugs with patents that grant exclusivity account for about 72 percent of drug spending, even though they are only about 10 percent of all prescriptions dispensed, according to the study, published Tuesday in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association. \u201dYou\u2019ve got a bunch of different tactics that are being used that can extend that exclusivity,\u201d says Aaron Kesselheim, a professor at Harvard Medical School and the study\u2019s lead author.",
        "Just southwest of bustling Charleston, S. C. lies a lush and rural gem called Wadmalaw Island, one of the Sea Islands that dot the shoreline. This is the home of the Charleston Tea Plantation, the only commercial tea plantation in America. Here, 127 acres of gleaming dark green tea bushes unfold in endless rows, framed against fields and silvery loops of Spanish moss that festoon the oak trees. With its sandy soils, subtropical climate and generous yearly rainfall of about 50 inches, Wadmalaw is an ideal home for tea.",
        "How important is it for human beings to push new frontiers? Is it just something that a few us are inclined toward \u2014 like searching out a new, untried restaurant rather than falling back on something familiar \u2014 or is it essential to our species\u2019 success? Could the need to take risks and expand into new territory be hardwired into our genetic make up? If so, does that mean expanding into space and the other worlds of our solar system is an imperative, rather than a luxury?",
        "Think before you post. That\u2019s not the message you typically get from Internet companies. The ethos on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram is to (over) share. But Nextdoor, a social network, has decided to block users from publishing certain posts, specifically when they appear to be racial profiling. A techie tackles race, Talking about race and racial profiling does not come naturally to Nirav Tolia, the CEO of Nextdoor. And yet, he\u2019s doing it anyway. \u201dWhat someone considers to be racist is something that is, unfortunately in many cases, in the eye of the beholder,\u201d he says.",
        "Do you know that feeling when a song moves you so much, you just feel like you have to add your own voice? Mexican culture has an answer to that: a cathartic, joyous yell called a grito.

The government\u2019s accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia must still be ratified by voters in a plebiscite in order to take effect.

        "Editor\u2019s note: Updated at 9:20 am ET to include Mylan\u2019s announcement that it will reimburse consumers for some of their costs. EpiPens are in your friend\u2019s purse and your kid\u2019s backpack. The school nurse has a few, as does Grandma. The medicine inside \u2014 epinephrine \u2014 has been around forever, and the handy gadget that injects it into your leg is not particularly new either. So members of Congress, responding to their angry constituents, want to know why the price of the EpiPen, which can reverse a allergic reaction, has risen about fivefold in the past decade.",
        "Updated 10:30 a. m. ET on Aug. 25.

        "A major study about the best way to treat breast cancer reveals that \u201dprecision medicine\u201d doesn\u2019t provide unambiguous answers about how to choose the best therapy. \u201dPrecision doesn\u2019t mean certainty,\u201d says David Hunter, a professor of cancer prevention at Harvard\u2019s T. H. Chan School of Public Health. That point is illustrated in a large study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, involving decisions about chemotherapy. As is true for many cancers, breast cancer responds best to treatment when it is caught early, before it has spread throughout the body. Dr.",
        "To a mathematician, it\u2019s a violent explosion that shoots out missiles of hot, wet air, slamming a turbulent cloud of moisture into anybody or anything that crosses its path. To the rest of us, it\u2019s a sneeze. And Lydia Bourouiba has made a career out of studying it. Bourouiba, a mathematical physicist, leads a research group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that studies fluid dynamics. On Wednesday, her team published a video of a sneeze in the New England Journal of Medicine. It\u2019s mesmerizing. It\u2019s also important.",
        "For such a commonplace bodily function, the sneeze has messed with our minds (and noses) for centuries. It will kill us, it won\u2019t kill us. We\u2019ll have bad luck, we\u2019ll have good luck. Watch out for Satan, he\u2019s wily and knows how to get into your nasal membranes. Did you have too much to eat? Are you sad? Do you have a weak heart? Technically, sneezing is a reflex to the usual irritants such as germs, dust or pollen. But it turns out your nose can get ruffled by some of the strangest things.",
        "Bernie Sanders is launching a new political organization. It\u2019s called Our Revolution. It aims to support candidates and, according to its website, \u201dadvance the progressive agenda that we believe in.\u201d But the revolution is getting off to a rocky start.

        "Newborn conjoined twins were evacuated from a Syrian rebel stronghold to the capital, Damascus, after lengthy negotiations earlier this month. But brothers Moaz and Nawras died early Wednesday before they could be transferred to a hospital outside Syria for urgent heart surgery. It\u2019s a tragic end to a story that was the subject of an international campaign to save their lives. As we reported, the babies, who were joined at the chest, were born in the besieged area of Eastern Ghouta on July 23. Their hearts shared a sac, according to the BBC.",
        "Tropical Storm Colin ripped across the Gulf of Mexico in June and hit the coast of southwest Florida with winds. Before it arrived, a team from the U. S. Geological Survey used a new computer model to predict how far inland the waves would invade. When the storm hit, the USGS sent Joe Long out to film it. Long is an oceanographer with the USGS. His video shows waves rushing up the beach to the foot of a sand dune. \u201dSo water levels are reaching that high,\u201d he says as we watch the video.",
        "They call it the octobot. The squishy robot described in the journal Nature is made entirely out of soft, flexible materials, runs on hydrogen peroxide, and looks like a baby octopus.

        "It\u2019s important to say right upfront that this isn\u2019t a story about pedophile priests. Bridie Farrell is Roman Catholic, but she says it was an adult mentor for her sports team, not a priest, who sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager. \u201dIt happened at his house, in his car, in his hotel room,\u201d Farrell says. Farrell did what a lot of kids do when they\u2019re molested: She kept silent. But 18 years later, when she was 31 years old, she went public with her story. The problem is that there\u2019s a ticking clock.",
