        "\u201dAnxious, pleading, faces the ugly, penetrating odor of decaying flesh the hands, covered with pustules, reaching out, as people begged for help . ... And there was no drug, no treatment that we could give them.\u201d Long after Dr. Donald A. Henderson orchestrated the massive international campaign to rid the world of smallpox, that memory of its victims remained etched in his mind. In his 2009 book Smallpox: The Death of a Disease, he vividly recalled the suffering he saw as he walked through a ward in Dhaka, Bangladesh in 1974.",
        "When Save the Children Australia signed up to help migrants that Australia was detaining on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean, workers for the aid group had to sign confidentiality agreements. Australia\u2019s government required the agreements. While unusually strict, they reflect a bargain many aid agencies must make in troubled areas of the world: to gain access to vulnerable people, they must remain diplomatically silent about what they see, avoiding embarrassment to the governments. The agreement imposed by Australia served as an example of what may happen behind that veil of secrecy.",
        "The EpiPen, an injectable drug that reverses severe allergic reactions, just got a little cheaper for some consumers. The device\u2019s manufacturer, Mylan NV, announced Thursday that it will offer coupons worth as much as $300 off a . The move is a reaction to harsh criticism from consumers and several lawmakers over repeated price increases that have boosted the cost of the medication to more than $600 from less than $100 just a few years ago.",
        "They\u2019ve known each other for only a few months, but this love story between an Australian ultramarathoner and a Chinese stray dog has seen extraordinary highs and lows. As Dion Leonard raced last March, a little brown dog started following him for miles across the Gobi Desert. The two quickly fell for each other and he named her Gobi. \u201dWhen she came into camp she followed me straight into my tent, laid down next to me and that was that \u2014 a bond had been developed,\u201d Leonard said in a blog post from the race.",
        "A dog video popped up in my Facebook feed this week that I\u2019d never before seen, though it was originally posted late last year. It\u2019s clearly a home video, not always perfectly in focus, but in just two minutes tells an intriguing story. A young girl, engrossed in an art project, dips the family dog\u2019s tail into shallow little cups of paint, then brushstrokes across her paper with the tail tip. Sure, it\u2019s a cute video. And yes \u2014 inevitably \u2014 it has sparked discussion about whether it\u2019s fair to the dog.",
        "It\u2019s the summer of 1998 and I\u2019m at the mall with my mom and my sister Anna, who has just turned 5. I\u2019m 7. Anna and I are cranky from being too hot, then too cold, then too bored. We keep touching things we are not supposed to touch, and by the time Mom drags us to the register, the cashier seems a little on edge. \u201dThey\u2019re mixed, aren\u2019t they?\u201d she says. \u201dI can tell by the hair.\u201d Mom doesn\u2019t smile, and Mom always smiles. \u201dI have absolutely no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d she says.",
        "If fashion is art, Sonia Rykiel is considered a master. Women\u2019s Wear Daily dubbed her the \u201dqueen of knitwear\u201d \u2014 though she was the first to admit she didn\u2019t know how to knit \u2014 and her designs have been shown in museums. Rykiel, who had Parkinson\u2019s disease, died Thursday morning at her home in Paris. She was 86. Artistic, independent, rebellious, Rykiel embodied the intellectual chic and feminism of Paris in the late 1960s. She wanted women to look both powerful and sexy. Above all, she wanted to give them complete freedom of movement.",
        "Federal data suggest illegally manufactured fentanyl, a drug that is 50 to 100 times stronger than morphine, is behind an increase in synthetic opioid deaths. A report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that there was a 426 percent increase in seized drug products that tested positive for fentanyl from 2013 to 2014. And separate data show the number of deaths involving synthetic opioids, a class that includes fentanyl and tramadol but not hydrocodone, rose 79 percent during that same period. Among 27 U. S.",
        "Angelo Alonzo, a resident of Portland, Maine, says he nearly died last month after injecting what he believed to be a safe dose of heroin \u2014 the same amount he\u2019s taken before. But this time, he says, the drug knocked him to his knees. \u201dAn amount that usually gives me a good mellow high was just way too much,\u201d he says, \u201dand I woke up in the shower and I was cold. And I didn\u2019t put myself there.\u201d Alonzo was lucky: A friend quickly treated him with naloxone, an emergency antidote, and he entered a rehab program.",
        "Updated at 7:10 p. m. ET, Like a lot of people\u2019s grandmothers, Flonzie keeps a candy jar in the living room of her home, which is also adorned with potted plants and family photos. For 74, this jar is a reminder of the absurd questions \u2014 questions with no real answers \u2014 that she and other had to answer before registering to vote in Mississippi in the 1960s. \u201d\u2019How many jelly beans in a pound of candy? . ..",
        "There\u2019s no denying it: The architecture on the National Mall commands a kind of weighty reverence. From the neoclassical columns of the Capitol dome to the immense, white marble of the Lincoln Memorial, charm does not seem to have been the design goal for the nation\u2019s front lawn. Save for one standout: the Smithsonian\u2019s Arts and Industries Building, which, until this summer, had been chained shut for years. With its colorful facade, arched windows, spires and rotunda, the AI (as it\u2019s often called) is a festive relief. Even the building\u2019s neighbor, the Smithsonian Castle, feels somber by comparison.",
        "In the name of fighting terrorism, authorities in Egypt are jailing people for offenses as small as a Facebook post or being at a protest. In the case of Hossam it was being in the wrong place at the wrong time \u2014 when security forces came to arrest a neighbor. \u201dThere is just one accusation for me, that I am related to a terrorist group, this is the only accusation that I have,\u201d he says.",
        "The study of the formation and logic of the universe \u2014 cosmology \u2014 and the study of exoplanets and their conduciveness to life do not seem to intersect much. Scientists in one field focus on the deep physics of the cosmos, while the others search for the billions upon billions of planets out there \u2014 and seek to unlock their secrets.",
        "Not 1, 000. Not 50. Not even 10. Zero. \u201dThere have so far been no laboratory confirmed cases of Zika virus in spectators, athletes or anyone associated with the Olympics,\u201d the World Health Organization said Thursday on its website. Now, no cases doesn\u2019t mean no one caught Zika at the Summer Games. About 80 percent of people who get infected don\u2019t know it. They don\u2019t have any symptoms. And those who do get sick often have only mild symptoms. So the vast majority of cases go unreported.",
        "In Little Haiti, Liberty City, and a number of other neighborhoods in Miami, canvassers are now walking door to door to spread the word about the risks of Zika, one household at a time \u2014 hoping to reach 25, 000 people the next six weeks. In some neighborhoods, these workers aren\u2019t sponsored by federal or state health agencies, but by Planned Parenthood. Lillian Tamayo, the CEO of Planned Parenthood of South, East and North Florida, told NPR that County has the state\u2019s largest population of people without health coverage, which leaves these residents particularly vulnerable to Zika.",
        "The Food and Drug Administration is recommending that blood banks screen all blood donations in the U. S. for the Zika virus. It\u2019s a major expansion from a Feb. 16 advisory that limited such screening to areas with active Zika virus transmission. In a statement released Friday, the FDA says all those areas are currently in compliance with blood screening, but that expanded testing is now needed. \u201dAs new scientific and epidemiological information regarding Zika virus has become available, it\u2019s clear that additional precautionary measures are necessary,\u201d the FDA\u2019s acting chief scientist, Luciana Borio, said in the statement.",
        "The obscene, threatening voicemail left for Maine Rep. Drew Gattine certainly wasn\u2019t anonymous. \u201dMr. Gattine, this is Gov. Paul Richard LePage,\u201d it began. \u201d\u201dI would like to talk to you about your comments about my being a racist, you c********r\u201d \u2014 a vulgarity referencing fellatio. \u201dI want you to prove I\u2019m a racist.

        "The presidential candidates this week accused one another of racism and bigotry, with Hillary Clinton arguing that Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policies are an invitation to the \u201d \u201d movement. \u201dThis is not conservatism as we have known it,\u201d the Democratic nominee said on Thursday during a speech in Reno, Nev. \u201dThis is not Republicanism as we have known it.

        "President Obama is expanding a national monument off the coast of Hawaii, more than quadrupling it in size and making it the world\u2019s largest protected marine area. The Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument was created by President George W. Bush in 2006. At the time, it was seven times larger than all the other U. S. marine sanctuaries combined and the biggest marine reserve in the world.

        "France\u2019s highest administrative court struck a blow against controversial \u2019burkini bans\u2019 Friday, upending one town\u2019s decision to prohibit the swimsuit on its beaches. The Council of State suspended the ban in just west of Nice, saying it \u201dseriously, and clearly illegally, breached the fundamental freedoms to come and go, the freedom of beliefs and individual freedom.\u201d The Riviera town was one of roughly 30 municipalities to forbid beachgoers from donning the swimsuit often worn by Muslim women, reporter Jake Cigainero tells our Newscast unit. The ruling is expected to affect those other bans, The Associated Press reports.",
        "The burkini has had a controversial summer in France. A number of towns along the Riveria banned the burkini \u2014 a portmanteau of \u201dbikini\u201d and \u201dburka,\u201d and a type of swimwear \u2014 in the wake of the deadly Bastille Day attacks in Nice. Officials argued that the swimwear isn\u2019t in line with France\u2019s secular views French socialist prime minister Manuel Valls called the burkini \u201da symbol of the enslavement of women.\u201d Critics of the ban did not agree that the burkini is a symbol of oppression or extremism.",
        "Orientation at Arkansas Tech University this year included a surprising topic for a Bible Belt state that pushes in high school. Every freshman was shown a newly produced video in which real students talk about the struggle of an unplanned pregnancy, and the challenge of staying in school as a parent. \u201dI lost a lot of friends,\u201d says one young woman in the video who had dreamed of becoming a surgeon.",
        "Reports out Thursday night reveal yet another principal of the Trump campaign in trouble. Newly appointed CEO Stephen K. Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News, was charged in 1996 with domestic violence against his second wife, several news outlets reported. The charges were eventually dropped, and Bannon pleaded \u201dnot guilty.\u201d The New York Times noted that, according to the police report of the incident, there were \u201dallegations that he threatened his then wife, the accuser, with retribution if she testified in the criminal case. . .. \u201d The New York Post first reported the news.",
        "Attitudes toward animals are a delicate and complicated matter. We can group animals into vertebrates and invertebrates, into the wild and the domestic \u2014 or into those we keep as pets, those we eat and those we regard with disgust as vermin. It\u2019s OK to love them \u2014 but only so much. And there\u2019s the question of what types of animals you can love. You\u2019re allowed to love a dog or a cat. But can you, should you, is it appropriate, to love other kinds of animals? My brother had a hermit crab when he was a boy.",
        "Once upon a time, cigarettes were the currency of choice when those behind bars needed to barter. But these days, America\u2019s prisoners are trading with ramen. So says Michael a doctoral candidate in the University of Arizona School of Sociology.

        "Hillary Clinton has not held a single press conference since the start of 2016, triggering charges that she\u2019s trying to duck questions from reporters on the campaign trail. Clinton and her senior campaign aides say that\u2019s absurd. They have pointed repeatedly to what they call the swiftly growing number of interviews she has granted. In late May, for example, Clinton told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper she had already done nearly 300 interviews.",
