        "When 2 feet of rain fell, and the Vermillion River swelled its banks earlier this month, the mayor of Maurice, La. Wayne Theriot, got hit with a double whammy: He lost his home and his office. The two are just a couple of hundred yards apart in this small town of about 1, 000 people that straddles Vermillion and Lafayette parishes in a largely rural corner of the state. \u201dYou\u2019re in City Hall \u2014 what\u2019s left of it,\u201d he says, pointing to the ruined furniture and computers in the tiny building.",
        "At a recent campaign stop in Philadelphia, Senate Democratic candidate Katie McGinty faced a tough crowd: . \u201dHi! How\u2019s everybody doin\u2019?\u201d McGinty said, as she entered the Western Learning Center, an program for local families. McGinty stopped here Tuesday to tout her economic agenda with a small group of local parents but first, it was story time. McGinty selected \u201dKing Bidgood\u2019s In The Bathtub,\u201d the tale of a king who refuses to get out of the tub.",
        "Two attractive young idealists named Barack and Michelle tour a Chicago full of hope together in Southside With You, a date movie about the First First Date. It\u2019s summer 1989, and neither of the future Obamas has any inkling what\u2019s in store for them (even though the script they\u2019re inhabiting does).",
        "If you could slough off the life you\u2019d built every few years and reinvent yourself as a whole new person, would that be a great escape or evidence of severe psychic damage? It\u2019s a great premise to lift off from, and I only wish that the overwrought but undercooked new drama, Complete Unknown, stepped up with a sharper idea of what it wanted to talk to us about. Especially with the suitably inward Rachel Weisz and Michael Shannon on hand to deepen the enigma and then open it up.",
        "Italian Nanni Moretti\u2019s Mia Madre (My Mother) is about an everyday drama in which nearly everyone eventually participates: the death of a parent. It begins not in a hospital but in the streets, where striking factory workers clash with police. It looks real enough, until the director yells, \u201dcut!\u201d The ability to interlace reality and fantasy is one of cinema\u2019s strengths, and at times Mia Madre is as bewitchingly surreal as 8 Fellini\u2019s classic. But Moretti\u2019s movie is less swaggering and more tender.",
        "The U. S. Department of Agriculture took a largely symbolic step to help struggling dairy farmers this week. It announced that it will buy $20 million worth of cheese and give it away to food banks. The USDA is doing this, it says, to help \u201dreduce a cheese surplus that is at a high.\u201d Food banks were happy to hear this news. Cheese is popular among their clients and often hard to get. This government donation will have a significant impact on their operations.",
        "There\u2019s a new building going up on the campus of the Cleveland Clinic. A very big building. \u201dThe skylight that we\u2019re standing under will eventually cover the area of an entire football field,\u201d says Russ Saghy, who oversees construction projects for the Cleveland Clinic. The skylight is part of the new Case Western Reserve University Health Education campus. The joint project with the Cleveland Clinic will eventually house the Case Western Reserve University\u2019s medical, dental and nursing schools, as well as the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s medical school.",
        "Caedmon Craig is attempting to write in cursive, and he is being helped by his mother. But a lot of erasing is happening at this kitchen table in Prattville, Ala. This school year Caedmon will be writing in cursive for the first time. For now he is only required to write his cursive letters separately, but he\u2019s ready for more. \u201dI think joining them is easier than separate,\u201d he says.",
        "If you\u2019ve seen Sleeping Beauty, The Jungle Book or the Toy Story movies, you\u2019ve seen the work of animator Floyd Norman for decades, he has helped bring Disney and Pixar classics to life. Now 81, Norman still works for Disney, where he has plied his trade, on and off, since he became the studio\u2019s first animator in the 1950s. Norman\u2019s love of art began long before his Disney job, as he reveals in a new documentary, An Animated Life. \u201dAny empty surface was a blank canvas for me,\u201d he says. His mother was constantly scrubbing scribbles off the walls.",
        "As players rose to stand for the national anthem at the game on Friday night, 49ers\u2019 quarterback Colin Kaepernick pointedly remained seated. His gesture was to protest the treatment of African Americans and minorities in the United States, as he told NFL. com after the game. Kaepernick has remained sitting during the anthem \u201din at least one other preseason game,\u201d according to the site. \u201dI am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,\u201d Kaepernick said, according to NFL. com.",

        "In Baton Rouge, La. people are using whatever tools they have to help their community recover from the flood. That includes cameras. Four photographers have been creating portraits of those affected. Their project, \u201dHumans of the Water,\u201d focuses not on what people lost, but on what they saved. One of those photographers is Collin Richie. He says documentary photography isn\u2019t typically his style.

        "Italy has started to bury its dead following a devastating earthquake on Wednesday that killed at least 290 people and left whole towns in ruins. The country has declared Saturday a national day of mourning for the quake\u2019s victims. Reporting from a state funeral in the town of Ascoli Piceno, NPR\u2019s Eleanor Beardsley described a community overcome with grief. She said the service was held in a gymnasium, where 35 caskets were laid out. \u201dPeople cried and held each other,\u201d Eleanor said.

        "When the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau looked into the regional bank BancorpSouth, it didn\u2019t just review thousands of loan applications. It sent in undercover operatives \u2014 some white, some black \u2014 who pretended to be customers applying for loans. \u201dThey had similar credit scores and similar background and situations,\u201d says CFPB Director Richard Cordray. \u201dOur investigation had found that BancorpSouth had engaged in illegal redlining in Memphis, meaning refusing to lend into specific areas of the city.\u201d That is, neighborhoods where most residents were or other minorities.",
        "One of America\u2019s most distinguished men of letters says he believes that speech, not evolution, has made human beings into the creative, imaginative, deliberate, destructive, and complicated beings who invented the slingshot and the moon shot, and wrote the words of the Bible, Don Quixote, Good Night Moon, the backs of cereal boxes, and Fifty and Shades of Grey. The Kingdom of Speech is Tom Wolfe\u2019s first book in 16 years. Wolfe tells NPR\u2019s Scott Simon that speech is \u201dthe attribute of attributes,\u201d because it\u2019s so unrelated to most other things about animals.",

When we recorded that session, Joy Williams and John Paul White had just released their album Barton Hollow they\u2019d go on to win four Grammy awards, achieve a gold record and play concerts. But the duo\u2019s success wasn\u2019t enough to sustain their partnership, which fell apart in 2014. Here are 10 more great duos that, unfortunately, weren\u2019t built to last.

        "Since 1984, MTV has given out awards to honor achievements in the world of music videos.

        "In the past week, the presidential campaign has alighted upon a volatile subject: the issue of race. Specifically, how Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have been cultivating their relationships with voters of different racial groups. On Thursday, for instance, Clinton delivered a blunt speech in Reno, Nev. criticizing the Republican nominee\u2019s track record with minorities and calling attention to the support he has received from white nationalist groups. Trump, meanwhile, called Clinton a \u201dbigot\u201d at a Mississippi rally, saying she and her fellow Democrats have taken the support of minority voters for granted.",
