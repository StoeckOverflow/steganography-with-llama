        "How well does Facebook know you? To the amusement \u2014 and possibly relief \u2014 of many, the answer seems to be not as well as it might hope. A recent New York Times article highlighted a new feature on the social media network that allows users to see what interests Facebook thinks they have, and what advertisements might be generated to target those preferences.

        "Recent studies and government reports continue to highlight what many Americans know by their wallets: Rising income differences, debt and stagnant real wages are among the biggest problems besetting the nation. That economic inequality is reflected in America\u2019s schools, right? Absolutely. But a study just out shows that the gap in school readiness between rich and poor children entering kindergarten closed significantly \u2014 by 10 to 16 percent \u2014 from 1998 to 2010.

D. and a journalist on Netflix\u2019s House of Cards. And the role which earned Zimmer her first Emmy nomination this year \u2014 reality TV producer Quinn King on Lifetime\u2019s UnREAL \u2014 could be TV\u2019s most caustic villain.

Many aspects of the weekend were what you\u2019d expect: reconnecting with her roommates and friends, catching up on their lives and careers, and (mild) revelry late into the night. As a spouse tagging along, I was braced for a nightmare of tales of yesteryear in which I\u2019d played no part (my wife and I met after college) and reprisals of inside jokes. But that\u2019s not what happened. Instead, I was inspired by the people I met and deeply touched by the stories they shared.",
