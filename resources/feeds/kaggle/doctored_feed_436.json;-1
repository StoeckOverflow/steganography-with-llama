        "We\u2019re not going to bury our nosb in the clouds and talk in general statements like the rest (which will never work), here is the list of what\u2019ll change for the new generation, according with the predictions from our friends in the world\u2019. surely we can all agree about one important matter; the future will have a lot of surpruses, good and (even more, in my oppotitim, but I am sure you will agree too\u2026 and we have some more time\u2026 for this to turn good again) the worst\u2026 but what do",
        "The current presidential campaign may seem unlike any in recent memory, especially when it comes to how the candidates are running their campaigns. Donald Trump has reportedly commanded more than $1 billion worth of free press and preferred holding rallies around the country that have attracted large crowds. Hillary Clinton, in contrast, seems to be running an almost closeted campaign. She has shied away from press conferences and favored more intimate events. Her strategy could even be likened to boxer Muhammad Ali\u2019s controversial \u201d \u201d strategy, in which he retreated until his rival exhausted himself and then attacked back.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign is going into five more states with a new $10 million television ad buy. It\u2019s the largest for the Trump campaign so far, which has been relatively slow to invest in TV ads, relying instead on free media coverage and the Republican nominee\u2019s large social media following. The campaign is now targeting the battleground states of New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada, Virginia and Colorado, putting Trump on the air in a total of nine states. The campaign rolled out its first set of ads earlier this month in Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio and North Carolina.",
        "Immigration has been a galvanizing issue in Donald Trump\u2019s campaign from the beginning. But in recent days, the Republican nominee has been adjusting his position \u2014 first suggesting he\u2019d be willing to \u201dsoften\u201d calls to deport people in the country illegally, then returning to a more stance after criticism from prominent conservatives. But many of Trump\u2019s staunchest supporters seem unconcerned about his apparent policy shifts. Over the weekend, Trump supporters streamed in and out of a new campaign office opening in the battleground state of Nevada, collecting yard signs and bumper stickers.",
        "The power of Big Thief lies in the stunning voice of Adrianne Lenker \u2014 as well as the band\u2019s intense rhythms, the guitar playing of Buck Meek and, right, the lyrics. Come to think of it, everything this band does serves the muscular warmth of these brilliant songs, which are not only memorable, but meaningful. \u201dMasterpiece\u201d is the first song in this Tiny Desk Concert, as well as Big Thief\u2019s tune. It\u2019s a song of mortality and walking through life with your friends by your side.",
        "More than three dozen audits reveal how some private Medicare plans overcharged the government for the majority of elderly patients they treated, often by overstating the severity of certain medical conditions, such as diabetes and depression. The Center for Public Integrity recently obtained, through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, the federal audits of 37 Medicare Advantage programs. These audits have never before been made public, and though they reveal overpayments from 2007 \u2014 money that has since been paid back \u2014 many plans are still appealing the findings.",
        "You\u2019ve likely heard that dark chocolate is good for you. Last year, researchers linked a regular chocolate habit to a reduced risk of heart disease. And, as we\u2019ve reported, compounds found in cocoa known as flavanols or polyphenols have been shown to improve vascular health by increasing blood flow. Researchers say some of these compounds can help the body form nitric oxide, a compound that causes blood vessels to dilate. \u201dWhat we\u2019ve seen is that intake of dark chocolate is associated with a greater ability of blood vessels to dilate when they should,\u201d Dr.",
        "The rumbling started on the afternoon of May 22, 1960. Sergio Barrientos, then about 8 years old, was walking down a street in his hometown in southern Chile when the ground started to shake. He remembers electrical wires swinging from the telephone poles \u2014 so violently that they slapped each other from opposite sides of the street. \u201dAt the same time, I saw some of the chimneys falling down through the roofs of the houses,\u201d says Barrientos.",
        "Three big political players were facing stiff competition and angry bases. And all three brushed those opponents aside with relative ease Tuesday night. Arizona\u2019s John McCain, Florida\u2019s Marco Rubio and embattled former Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz all won their parties\u2019 nominations to be elected for another term in Congress. That despite millions of dollars spent against their candidacies by upstarts, some deep pocketed, fueled by anger at politics as usual. But that seemed to fizzle when the votes came in. It once again shows the power of the incumbency.",
        "One of the Islamic State\u2019s top commanders and the man in charge of disseminating its propaganda was killed in Aleppo, Syria, the group\u2019s Amaq news service announced. Abu Mohammed the news service said, was \u201dmartyred while surveying the operations to repel the military campaigns against Aleppo.\u201d The report did not list a cause of death. The Islamic State has erroneously claimed its operatives are dead in the past, and the Pentagon has not confirmed his death. Law enforcement sources tell NPR\u2019s Dina that they believe the announcement is genuine.",
        "As the Islamic State loses territory and retreats, it leaves behind grim evidence of its occupation: mass graves, filled with dozens or hundreds of bodies. The Associated Press has documented 72 such graves in Iraq and Syria \u2014 and the wire service says many more are expected to be revealed as the Islamic State continues to cede ground. Some of the gravesites are too dangerous to be excavated, according to the AP, and for at least 16 of them, officials won\u2019t even hazard a guess as to how many bodies are contained within.",
        "As part of the project A Nation Engaged, NPR and member stations are exploring America\u2019s role in the world heading into the presidential election. Everyone knew President Obama would say something about gay rights when he visited Kenya last summer. Many American activists were pressing him to publicly condemn Kenya\u2019s law making homosexuality a crime. But Kenyan gays and lesbians were wary. In the weeks leading up to Obama\u2019s visit, Kenyan politicians took to the airwaves to assert their bona fides.",
        "President Obama shortened the prison sentences of 111 inmates Tuesday, including 35 people who had expected to spend the rest of their lives in federal custody, authorities told NPR. Word of the new batch of clemency grants came as the second in command at the Justice Department told NPR that lawyers there have worked through an enormous backlog of drug cases and, despite doubts from prisoner advocates, they will be able to consider each of the thousands of applications from drug criminals before Obama leaves office in 2017.",
        "A holiday celebrating a dish beloved of many West Africans, World Jollof Day, was marked last week. Jollof is a celebration dish. You eat it at parties, naming ceremonies, weddings, funerals \u2014 you name it, you will see the familiar and comforting pot of steaming jollof rice. But jollof is also war \u2014 of the deliciously friendly variety. I come from Ghana, am based in Senegal and travel on reporting assignments all over West Africa. Almost every one of us from the region has grown up with fluffy, jollof rice, I suspect, as part of our diet.",
        "As an I had no idea how the rest of Africa felt about my country, or how Egyptians felt about being on the continent \u2014 until I saw the Twitter hashtag #IfAfricaWasASchool, which has been trending over the past week. It made me laugh out loud. Clearly, we Egyptians are a bit snobby. The hashtag invites people to assign various schoolyard archetypes \u2014 nerds, jokes, popular kids and more \u2014 to countries in Africa. And sure, it\u2019s funny. But it also sheds some light on African countries\u2019 reputations and relationships with each other.",
        "When Gene Wilder was 8 years old, his mother had a heart attack \u2014 and he took it upon himself to try to cheer her up. \u201dIt was the first time I ever tried consciously to make someone else laugh,\u201d Wilder said. \u201dAnd when I was successful, after peeing in her pants, she\u2019d say, \u2019Oh, Jerry, now look what you\u2019ve made me do.\u2019 \u201d Wilder \u2014 who was born Jerome Silberman \u2014 went on to become a comic actor whose film credits included Willy Wonka The Chocolate Factory and The Producers and Blazing Saddles.",
        "When you praise a dog, it\u2019s listening not just to the words you say but also how you say them. That might not be huge news to dog owners. But now scientists have explored this phenomenon by using an imaging machine to peek inside the brains of 13 dogs as they listened to their trainer\u2019s voice.",
        "Scientists \u2014 and anyone who lives with a canine \u2014 know that dogs pay close attention to the emotion in our voices. They listen for whether our tone is friendly or mean, how the pitch goes up or down and even the rhythms in our speech. But what about the meaning of the words we say? Sure, a few studies have reported on supersmart dogs that know hundreds of words. Chaser, a border collie in South Carolina, even learned 1, 022 nouns and commands to go with them.",
        "Donald Trump will give a speech Wednesday outlining his immigration stance. Given the last week of news coverage, he could have some serious explaining to do. An immigration policy centered around extreme positions \u2014 mass deportation of 11 million immigrants in the country illegally, plus building a wall along the U. S. border \u2014 initially helped Trump stand out in the massive Republican primary field.",
        "They aren\u2019t saying it\u2019s alien, but they are saying it\u2019s \u201dinteresting.\u201d The SETI Institute \u2014 the private organization that looks for signals of extraterrestrial life \u2014 has announced that it is investigating reports of an unusual radio signal picked up by Russian astronomers. The signal was detected on a much wider bandwidth than the SETI Institute uses in its searches, and the strength of the received signal was \u201dweak,\u201d SETI Institute astronomer Seth Shostak wrote in a blog post. It was unusual, both in its design and its \u201dbeam shape,\u201d he says.",
        "Part 1 of the TED Radio Hour episode In Search Of, About Seth Shostak\u2019s TED Talk, Will we find ET in the next 25 years? Seth Shostak, senior astronomer at SETI, says yes. He explains that new technologies and the laws of probability make the breakthrough likely. About Seth Shostak, Seth Shostak is the senior astronomer at the the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif.",
        "There were 40 boats \u2014 some inflatable rubber vessels and others made of wood \u2014 packed with thousands of men, women and children who had decided the sea was safer than the land. They set out from Libya. They did not have enough fuel to reach Europe. In just 24 hours, the Italian navy and vessels operated by aid groups including M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and Proactiva say they rescued some 6, 500 people. As the crews neared the dangerously boats, men in life vests hurled themselves into the water and swam toward the rescue vessels.",
        "Two weeks from now in Surrey, England, a coroner\u2019s inquest is scheduled for a most peculiar death. Here are the facts: In November 2012, a man died while out jogging near his Surrey home. The man was reported to have been in robust health, and police declared that the death was not suspicious. But here are a few more facts: The jogger was a Russian banker who had fled Russia after helping expose tax fraud that implicated both the Mafia and the Russian state. Traces of a rare, poisonous flowering plant were found in his stomach.",
        "If you doubt that Ryan Lochte is going on Dancing With The Stars to try to change the subject away from what he himself has called his \u201dimmature, intoxicated behavior\u201d during the Rio Olympics, where he admits he lied about at least some of his story about being robbed at gunpoint, just ask him. It\u2019s not a secret. He told USA Today, \u201dIt\u2019s just an amazing show and hopefully when I\u2019m on it, people will watch and enjoy the show and talk about the show . ..",
        "When people hear the word drought, they likely think of California. But there\u2019s also an extreme drought in parts of New England. The Northeast is experiencing the worst drought in more than a decade. The Northeast has more than 175, 000 farms that produce more than $21 billion a year in food, hay and flowers, according to the U. S. Department of Agriculture. But this year, many fields are bone dry \u2014 and that has many farmers thinking about how to manage their land, their animals and the water that is there.",
        "When should police be able to deactivate your social media account? The question is becoming more urgent, as people use connections in the middle of critical incidents involving law enforcement. In the case of Korryn Gaines in Baltimore County, Md. earlier this month, police said that a suspect actively using a social media connection makes a standoff worse. Gaines posted videos to Instagram of the unfolding standoff with police, who were outside her apartment trying to get her to surrender. After an standoff, Gaines was shot and killed by Baltimore County police.",
        "The European Union\u2019s executive branch has found that Ireland granted unfair and illegal tax breaks to the tech giant Apple, and ruled that Apple now owes more than $14. 5 billion in back taxes. The commissioner in charge of competition policy, Margrethe Vestager, says that under EU rules, \u201dMember states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies.\u201d But the European Commission found that Ireland allowed Apple \u2014 which has two companies incorporated in Ireland, Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe \u2014 to pay far less in taxes than other companies did.",
        "Summer is the time for music obsessions. That means finding new albums and new artists. It can also mean finding movies or TV shows about new albums and new artists. For me, this summer\u2019s awesomeness has been the gift of both. For the last three weeks, my focus has been pinned on Netflix\u2019s new series The Get Down and \u2014 just as important \u2014 the soundtrack to the musical Hamilton. Between them, I\u2019ve been thinking about the arc of art and science and how they can evolve in similar ways.",
        "Artists are supposed to be unafraid. We want them to take those risks, symbolically and sometimes personally, that reasonable people would caution against: Defy physical limits. Risk offending others. Expose unmanageable emotions to the open air. Do these things, we say to our painters and writers and singers, so that we can imagine, through you, what it feels like. Martha Wainwright has risen to that challenge since she was 21 years old. Now she\u2019s 40, the author of three stunning (and stunningly underrated) studio albums and numerous notable live works and collaborations.",
        "When DNA colon cancer screening tests find abnormalities, are patients discouraged about getting more diagnostic testing because of costs they will incur? And why do hospitals sometimes send a second bill for treatments given in a doctor\u2019s office? Here are the answers. A DNA test to screen for colon cancer is available that is readily paid for by health plans, including Medicare. But if I have a positive Cologuard test result, I\u2019d have to pay several hundred dollars for a regular diagnostic colonoscopy. Doesn\u2019t this discourage people from getting screened for colon cancer, which is the goal, after all?"
