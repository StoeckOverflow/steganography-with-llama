        "Forget Hawaii or Fiji The World\u2019... - February\n24/2/97, Page C2\nWould like some feedback. My wife & myself, are contently planning a one way flight (to N.Z.) and have the money. But would also preferably have some company and not just a seat to fill (although the flight price for the return trip, is the main issue and a lot lower with two persons than if it were for just the both if one of us is the other\u2019 one half way around in N/C & P And, unlike natural waves, this one has an owner: the Kelly Slater Wave Co.",
        "Like many schools, Gibson Elementary in St. Louis had big problems with attendance \u2014 many students were missing nearly a month of school a year. Melody Gunn, who was the principal at Gibson last year, set out to visit homes and figure out why kids weren\u2019t showing up. Her biggest discovery? They didn\u2019t have clean uniforms to wear to school. Many families, she found, didn\u2019t have washing machines in the home, and kids were embarrassed to show up at school wearing dirty clothes. The result was that often, they didn\u2019t come.",
        "The VE Simonetti Historic Tuba Collection in Durham, N. C. is the result of an obsession that grew one at a time. Vincent Simonetti started playing tuba in high school in the 1950s \u2014 and it was love at first puff. \u201dAnd I would draw it in study hall. I\u2019d draw pictures of it. I don\u2019t know why. I just became obsessed with it,\u201d he says. He and his wife, Ethel, used to run a tuba exchange that sold sousaphones, euphoniums and other members of the tuba family to high school bands.",
        "To older country fans, Dolly Parton and Loretta Lynn are the ultimate examples of superstars who stayed true to their humble roots. Tara Thompson, 28, happens to come from Parton\u2019s mountains and Lynn\u2019s bloodline. The younger singer, typical of her oversharing generation, translates their pride into songs. When most people hear the name \u201dLoretta Lynn,\u201d they picture a icon whose life inspired a Hollywood movie. When she was a kid, Thompson had no clue Lynn was a country superstar. \u201dMy grandma and her are first cousins, so they grew up together,\u201d Thompson says.",
        "Updated at 8 p. m. ET, A Donald Trump huddled with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto in a hastily arranged meeting in Mexico City on Wednesday. Both men pledged a commitment to strengthening the U. S. relationship. Trump said he had a \u201dvery substantive\u201d conversation with Pe\u00f1a Nieto during which he reaffirmed the right of the U. S. to protect its borders and build a wall, but that his pledge to make Mexico pay for it didn\u2019t come up. \u201dWe didn\u2019t discuss that,\u201d Trump said.",
        "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump met with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto at the president\u2019s official resident in Mexico City. It was a hastily arranged visit by a presidential candidate who has spent much of his campaign insulting Mexico and its people. \u201dI love the Mexican people, but Mexico is not our friend,\u201d Trump tweeted last year. \u201dThey\u2019re killing us at the border and they\u2019re killing us on jobs and trade.\u201d Earlier this summer, Trump joked about a Mexican attack on U. S. soil. So, how\u2019s his visit going over down there?",
        "In a speech Wednesday night, Donald Trump will lay out \u2014 and clarify \u2014 his proposed immigration policy. His stance on immigration has appeared to change more in the past 10 days than it has in the past 10 months. But perhaps the most unexpected element of the recent shifts in rhetoric is that Trump has praised President Obama\u2019s work on immigration enforcement, a surprising turn for a Republican candidate. \u201dWhat people don\u2019t know is that Obama got tremendous numbers of people out of the country. Bush, the same thing.",
        "Stephen Coning, a former Marine, took his own life this summer, leaving behind a wife and a son. By chance, it was the same week the Department of Veterans Affairs released conclusive data showing that the rate of suicide for those who served is now much higher than for civilians. Despite that connection, the VA does not presume all suicides to be \u201dservice connected.\u201d Sounds like red tape \u2014 but that means Coning\u2019s family has so far received little formal support from the VA.",
        "Teen pregnancy is way down. And a study suggests that the reason is increased, and increasingly effective, use of contraceptives. From 2007 to 2013, births to teens age 15 to 19 dropped by 36 percent pregnancies fell by 25 percent from 2007 to 2011, according to federal data. But that wasn\u2019t because teens were shunning sex. The amount of sex being had by teenagers during that time period was largely unchanged, says the study, which was published online in the Journal of Adolescent Health. And it wasn\u2019t because they were having more abortions.",
        "A divided U. S. Supreme Court refused Wednesday to reinstate a set of voter restrictions enacted by the Legislature in the battleground state of North Carolina. Last month a federal appeals court invalidated the restrictions, declaring that they were deliberately targeted at making it more difficult for to vote. The restrictions were enacted in 2013 shortly after the U. S. Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act.",
        "Editor\u2019s note: Reporter John Otis first covered Venezuela 19 years ago and has returned many times since. On Wednesday, the day before a planned opposition demonstration, he and other foreign journalists were barred from entering the country. He filed this report while awaiting a flight out. As a foreign correspondent based in Colombia, I\u2019ve made dozens of reporting trips to Venezuela \u2014 but today\u2019s has been the shortest by far. As soon as I stepped off the plane at the Caracas airport, immigration officials confiscated my passport, then ordered me to take the next flight back to Bogot\u00e1.",
        "More than 1, 000 residents of a public housing complex in East Chicago, Ind. are now forced to relocate because of dangerously high lead levels in the area\u2019s soil. The West Calumet Housing Complex, which houses primarily families, lies on the site of a former lead smelting company, as member station WBEZ reported. In July, the Environmental Protection Agency reported high lead levels in the soil in parts of the complex and notified the residents.",
        "Daddy would not have liked Colin Kaepernick. Had the San Francisco quarterback refused to stand for the national anthem in my father\u2019s presence, Daddy would have fixed him in a stare that could freeze the blood in your veins. Then, to no one in particular \u2014 but to everyone within earshot \u2014 he\u2019d give the young man a lesson in patriotic etiquette. \u201dYou stand during the national anthem,\u201d he\u2019d say, punctuating his words with fire.",
        "A $7 million, comprehensive census of African elephants has found that the population decreased by nearly a third between 2007 and 2014. The Great Elephant Census was conducted over three years, and set out to effectively count every savanna elephant in 18 countries in Africa, accounting for 93 percent of the savanna elephants in those countries. The conclusion \u2014 that the population declined by 144, 000 animals in just seven years \u2014 is sobering. The results were published in the journal PeerJ.",
        "At the Mirebalais Hospital in Haiti\u2019s central plateau, Dr. Louise Ivers and Dr. Roman are examining a baby girl who was born in early July with microcephaly, a skull often associated with Zika infections. The baby, named Chinashama, is dressed in a white smock adorned with small flowers. Her legs cross unnaturally over her shins, and her mother, Chrisnette Sainvilus, says the baby cries a lot and has trouble passing stool. \u201dDay and night she\u2019s crying,\u201d the mother of two says. It\u2019s unclear what physical and mental problems Chinashama is facing.",
        "After leaving an obscene voicemail for a state legislator, Maine Gov. Paul LePage has apologized to that lawmaker, waffled on whether he would consider resigning, and stood by his widely criticized comments characterizing drug dealers as overwhelmingly black and Hispanic. LePage also has told reporters he will never again speak to the press. You might remember that the Republican governor left a remarkably vulgar message for Democratic Maine Rep. Drew Gattine last week.",
        "The singer Dua Lipa has released just five singles, all within the last 12 months. She won\u2019t put out her debut album until February 2017. But the artist has already begun to take shape as a creative force with a sound she calls \u201ddark pop,\u201d melding sparse beats with an ear for melody and interpretation. She might be a pop star: When she\u2019d released just two songs, the BBC picked her for its Sound of 2016 list.",
        "The other day, I did something incredibly mortifying. I forced myself to mimic the Indian accent in front of Indians who, unlike me, have an Indian accent. To back up a second, my mom and dad immigrated to the States from India and Pakistan in the \u201970s and \u201980s, and I was born and raised in the Philadelphia area.",
        "An experimental drug dramatically reduced the toxic plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, a team reports in the journal Nature. Results from a small number of patients who received a high dose of the drug, called aducanumab, hint that it may also be able to slow the loss of memory and thinking. \u201dIf that hint of a clinical benefit is confirmed, it would be a game changer in the fight against Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d says Dr. Eric Reiman, executive director of the Banner Alzheimer\u2019s Institute in Phoenix.",
        "Inside a sprawling warehouse just outside downtown Los Angeles, a line of seamstresses sew blouses. This city is still the garment capital of the U. S. even though it employs a fraction of the workers it once did. Since 1990, the number of U. S. apparel manufacturing jobs has fallen by 80 percent. \u201dThe charts and the statistics are really frightening,\u201d says Ilse Metchek, head of the California Fashion Association. Metchek, who has worked in the industry for half a century, says she has seen firsthand the devastating effects free trade agreements have had across the country.",
        "The Food and Drug Administration is warning that patients and doctors should more fully understand the potentially risks of combining or sleep medications with prescription opioids. To that end, the agency is requiring that nearly 400 products carry a \u201dblack box warning\u201d highlighting the risks from combined use, it said in a press release Wednesday. The risks include extreme sleepiness, respiratory depression, coma and death. The move comes after an extensive review of scientific evidence by the FDA showing that physicians have been increasingly prescribing these drugs together.",

        "Wednesday, the U. S. Department of Education unveiled new rules, explaining to states and districts how they can prove they\u2019re spreading resources fairly between poor and schools. Today\u2019s release is a of rules that were first unveiled last spring and that caused quite a stir, creating a political unicorn: a fight in which Republicans and teachers unions found themselves on the same side. That fight hinged on a simple fact of life in America\u2019s schools: Districts often spend more money in more affluent schools.",
        "The twin babies were just 5 days old, a month premature and for a dangerous journey across the Mediterranean Sea. But their mother, Tesfamamrim Merhawit, decided the sea ahead was safer than the land they left behind. Traveling alone with her infants, she told The Associated Press she boarded a boat in Libya, bound for Europe. But the boat didn\u2019t have enough fuel to get to Europe. About 15 miles off the coast, she and her children were rescued by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, or MSF. They are being treated by the medical aid group at a hospital in Sicily.",

        "Opinions may diverge initially \u2014 but once we start to think about it, no question is harder than figuring out the origin of everything. The more popular phrasings go something like, \u201dWhere did the world come from?\u201d or \u201dWhy is there something rather than nothing?\u201d This is the question of creation, of how the universe and everything in it came to be. And, although we\u2019ve made great progress towards understanding the universe and its history, we are still far from understanding its origin.",
        "Part One in an NPR Ed series on mental health in schools. You might call it a silent epidemic. Up to one in five kids living in the U. S. shows signs or symptoms of a mental health disorder in a given year.

That week, Pannell visited Josiah\u2019s school and, with his teacher and guidance counselor, explained to his class what had happened. \u201dI\u2019ll never forget the three of us sitting up there \u2014 and all these little shining faces looking up at us \u2014 talking about how Josiah lost his dad and he might be sad for a while,\u201d Pannell says.

        "Thomas O\u2019Donnell\u2019s kindergarten kids are all hopped up to read about Twiggle the anthropomorphic Turtle. \u201dWho can tell me why Twiggle here is sad,\u201d O\u2019Donnell asks his class at Matthew Henson Elementary School in Baltimore. \u201dBecause he doesn\u2019t have no friends,\u201d a student pipes up. And how do people look when they\u2019re sad? \u201dThey look down!\u201d the whole class screams out. Yeah, Twiggle is lonely. But, eventually, he befriends a hedgehog, a duck and a dog.
