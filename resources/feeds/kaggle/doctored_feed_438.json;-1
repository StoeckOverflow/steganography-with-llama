        "\u201dI\u2019m not comfortable eating a salty dried sea vegetable when my mouth waters over something so much juxtafier than it.\u201d \u2013 Me, probably a week and a quarter away now (2/5 days in my new life and a quarter away on my journey, if my calculations on my calendar were on point, which we already discussed is a big fat f\u2019ck off point in terms if it even having the same meaning in a language as English and it probably even having numbers in order on said point).",
        "Hundreds of Catholics have been protest at the Irish embessment. \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442 \u201dWhen I was coming of age, she was the living saint,\u201d says the Most Rev. Robert Barron, the auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.",
        "It sounds like a crazy idea. Convince a survivor of sexual assault to tell her story by filming herself with a dragon imposed on her face. That\u2019s what Indian journalist Yusuf Omar did. He discovered that Snapchat, a mobile app that allows users to create photo or video \u201dstories\u201d that disappear after 24 hours, can be used to document a victim\u2019s account while obscuring his or her identities. Its \u201dfilters\u201d \u2014 illustrated or animated digital overlays \u2014 can transform a subject\u2019s face into anything from a flower child to a puppy.",
        "Justin Trudeau has had a number of careers: schoolteacher, snowboard instructor, and since last year, prime minister of Canada. Now he\u2019s an action hero. A new issue of Civil War II from Marvel Comics, being released Aug. 31, has Trudeau facing in the halls of Canada\u2019s Parliament \u2014 and in the boxing ring. The front cover shows Trudeau sitting in the corner of a boxing ring, elbows resting on the ropes. He\u2019s wearing boxing shorts, a tank top emblazoned with a large maple leaf and a smile that\u2019s a bit difficult to read.",
        "The extended drought in California has farmers looking for ways to use less water. Among them: growing feed indoors using hydroponics. The new diet is making some Central Valley sheep very happy. On Golden Valley Farm an hour north of Fresno, Mario Daccarett\u2019s employees milk 500 sheep every day, in rounds of 12. This creamy milk eventually is turned into cheese and sold at places like Whole Foods. \u201dThey tell me that our Golden Ewe cheese is the best for grilled cheese sandwich ever,\u201d Daccarett says.",
        "To carry out his immigration policy, Donald Trump proposed hiring 5, 000 additional Border Patrol agents and tripling the number of \u201ddeportation officers.\u201d But that would continue an already expansion of the government agencies responsible for those tasks \u2014 even as the number of illegal border crossers has shrunk dramatically. That\u2019s not even to mention the billions of dollars it would cost to build a wall across the length of the entire U. S. border. Here are six things to consider: 1.",
        "Donald Trump has provided the political world with many moving moments over the past year, but none quite like the whiplash mood swing between his daytime and nighttime performances in Mexico City and Phoenix on Wednesday. In the daylight hours, Trump struck his most presidential pose to date with a solemn (if somewhat grumpy) reading of prepared remarks at a news conference alongside Mexico\u2019s President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. That somber event, inside the Mexican presidential residence, epitomized the more moderate image Trump has pursued on immigration issues over the past 10 days.",
        "They call it \u201dThe Taking of Caracas.\u201d A flood of Venezuelans \u2014 supporters of the opposition, unhappy with President Nicolas Maduro \u2014 marched in the country\u2019s capital on Thursday, demanding a recall election. Venezuela\u2019s economy is in freefall. Food shortages have left grocery stores bare, while medicine shortages have frustrated doctors who say they have a fraction of the supplies that they need. Inflation is rampant, lootings and riots are common and blackouts are frequent, as John Otis has been reporting for NPR for months. All this, in the country with the world\u2019s largest oil reserves.",
        "If it were a phone call, we might call it a butt dial: A strong radio signal that set off questions about whether it emanated from an advanced alien race earlier this week is now believed to have come from a terrestrial source, and possibly from a Russian military satellite. The clarification came after researchers at the SETI Institute \u2014 the private organization that searches for signals that might confirm extraterrestrial life \u2014 announced they were investigating an \u201dinteresting\u201d radio signal that was reported by Russian astronomers, as Camila Domonoske wrote for the on Tuesday.",
        "Top brass at PepsiCo has talked for months about the introduction of an organic line. And now, according to Bloomberg, the company is rolling out G Organic \u2014 yep, an organic version of the famously technicolored sports drink Gatorade. (Think crimson red, electric blue and neon green shades.) \u201dGatorade really dominates the [sports drink] market right now,\u201d says Beth Bloom, senior food and drink analyst at the market research firm Mintel. Gatorade commands 77 percent of sports drink sales in the U. S. \u201dI think the [organic line] will broaden the appeal,\u201d says Bloom.",
        "Only five Indian citizens have won the Nobel Prize, and four of them have a deep Kolkata connection. This is a source of great pride to us with roots in that city. But when I went to the U. S. I realized quickly that nobody had heard of literary giant Rabindranath Tagore or physicist C. V. Raman. Even economist Amartya Sen was not that . But everyone knew of Mother Teresa.",
        "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has been calling for a criminal investigation of his political opponent Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail this year. Trump is angry the FBI probe of Clinton\u2019s email server ended with no charges. Now, he says, an independent outsider needs to look at the Clinton Foundation. \u201dThe Justice Department is required to appoint an independent special prosecutor because it has proven itself to be really, sadly, a political arm of the White House,\u201d Trump said in Akron, Ohio, last week.",
        "This year marks the 150th anniversary of the birth of Beatrix Potter, one of the most enduring and cherished children\u2019s authors of all time. To commemorate the anniversary, a new, story by Potter, called The Tale of Kitty in Boots, has been released. Readers, we\u2019ve been down this road before, not too long ago, and it didn\u2019t end well. Atticus Finch\u2019s reputation took a hit after his exposure in Harper Lee\u2019s Go Set A Watchman as a segregationist and reactionary extremist.",
        "In a brief and surprising statement, Dallas Police Chief David O. Brown announced he is ending his career as a member of his city\u2019s police force. Brown is perhaps best known for leading his department in the aftermath of the slaying of five Dallas police officers by a disgruntled war veteran on July 7. \u201dLet\u2019s always remember the fallen officers including the five officers on July 7, 2016, and the brave men and women of the Dallas Police Department for their sacrifices to keep Dallas safe. Their memory will remain with all of us forever,\u201d Brown said.",
        "Eight yellow garden spiders, also called writing spiders or Argiope aurantia, set up shop at various locations around the exterior of my house this summer. These strikingly large, spiders were fascinating to watch: Remaining immobile for long periods, occasionally they would rapidly travel their web \u2014 unusually patterned with its zigzag of silk or \u201dwriting\u201d in the center \u2014 to collect and \u201dwrap up\u201d a tiny prey animal. Luckily for me, one of the biggest spiders resided directly outside my study window, so I could observe all this from only a few inches away, through clear glass.",
        "Costa Rica is best known for its vacation beaches and lush rain forests. But recently it has become a thoroughfare for tens of thousands of migrants from South America and elsewhere who are hoping to reach the U. S. Many are from the Caribbean, but a significant number trekking through the country are Africans and Southeast Asians, and collectively, they are straining Costa Rica\u2019s welcoming reputation. Migration officer Marvin Rodriguez is on the phone. He\u2019s getting word that authorities are sending two buses carrying 120 migrants that just crossed into Costa Rica on its southern border with Panama.",
        "Janus Island, despite its rocky hilltops, patches of farmland and ample beaches, can\u2019t be found on a map. That\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t exist. But to be fair to Janus, most remote islands aren\u2019t easy to find on maps either, unless you know what you\u2019re looking for. The gorgeous new period drama The Light Between Oceans does know what it\u2019s looking for. Set on the fictitious Janus, which lies some distance from the Australian coast, the film understands the romance and the mystique that arises from picturesque isolation.",
        "Consumers and lawmakers pushing for cheaper alternatives to the EpiPen, an antidote for allergic reactions, and other drugs are seeking answers about a stubborn backlog of generic drug applications at the Food and Drug Administration. Even after the agency started levying user fees on drugmakers in 2012 to pay for more people to review the medicines, the backlog of decisions still stretches almost four years.",
        "On a muggy afternoon in Atlanta, Jennifer Schuble, 40, hops on her bicycle and clips into the pedals. She zooms around the steep banks of a velodrome. She drafts behind her coach, who\u2019s on a motorcycle, holding the pace steady at 30 miles per hour. The Olympics are over in Rio de Janeiro, which means it\u2019s now time for the 2016 Paralympic Games, which begin Wednesday in the Brazilian city. There have been issues in the to the Paralympics, with organizers announcing some cutbacks due to funding shortages. But thousands of athletes will be there as planned.",
        "Throughout the last academic year, we\u2019ve followed a group of students who graduated from high school a few years ago in Montgomery County, Md. just outside Washington, D. C. We spent the last year talking with them about their choice of public, private or community college. Was the cost worth it? What is the value of higher education? It turns out they\u2019re all satisfied customers. And among the most important subjects they report learning a lot about was themselves. Reconciling their plans and dreams with real life.",
        "Georgetown University will be offering an admissions edge to descendants of enslaved people sold to fund the school, officials announced on Thursday. Jesuit priests connected to the private Catholic university sold 272 enslaved people in 1838, to pay off the university\u2019s massive debts. The men, women and children were sold to plantations in Louisiana the university received the equivalent of $3. 3 million, securing its survival. A working group, created last year to explore Georgetown\u2019s historical ties to slavery, says even more slaves might have been sold in the 1830s to keep the school afloat.",
        "In the ferocious, sprawling brawl over genetically modified crops, one particular question seems like it should have a simple factual answer: Did those crops lead to more use of pesticides, or less? Sadly, there\u2019s no simple answer. Pesticides include both insecticides and herbicides. Backers of GMOs point to the example of crops containing new genes that fight off insect pests, so farmers don\u2019t have to spray insecticides. Biotech critics point to the example of crops that have been altered to tolerate specific weedkillers, like glyphosate, thus encouraging farmers to rely more heavily on those herbicides.",
        "It takes time to explain an artist like Juan Gabriel to those unfamiliar with who he was. The singer, who died Sunday, was practically a household name throughout the world, but his death caused hardly a blip of recognition among most of those who\u2019d tuned in to MTV\u2019s Video Music Awards the night of his death. That\u2019s what Alt. Latino is for. For this week\u2019s episode, we gathered a few folks to come play some of their favorite Juan Gabriel tracks \u2014 not only to mourn his death, but also to unpack his immense popularity and success.",
        "Two days before SpaceX was to launch a communications satellite that would widen Internet access in Africa, an unmanned rocket and its payload were destroyed in an explosion on a launch pad in Cape Canaveral, Fla. Smoke billowed from the pad where the satellite was to be launched Saturday morning. A \u201dsignificant explosion\u201d hit the launch area early Thursday, the 45th Space Wing at Cape Canaveral Air Station tells member station WMFE\u2019s Brendan Byrne. It said no casualties were reported and that there was no threat to the public\u2019s safety.",
        "Just over a month ago, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague issued two important rulings. One soundly rejected Beijing\u2019s extensive claim of sovereignty in the South China Sea. The other focused on whether China had caused environmental damage as it constructed artificial islands in the region to help prop up its claim. The South China Sea\u2019s disputed waters are claimed by seven countries, and The Hague rulings came in response to a case brought against China by the Philippines.",
        "Larry Gerdes is having his barn taken down and disassembled in Malta Bend, Mo. It\u2019s about the size of a garage but stands much taller in a clearing surrounded by stalks of corn. The barn\u2019s exterior is graying, part of its roof is missing, and there\u2019s a gaping hole looking out from the hayloft. It\u2019s about 100 years old, and it\u2019s not really useful. \u201dIt\u2019s deteriorated and it would cost a lot of money to repair it,\u201d Gerdes says. \u201dAnd it doesn\u2019t fit into modern farming.",
        "As part of the project A Nation Engaged, NPR and member stations are exploring America\u2019s role in the world heading into the presidential election. The United Kingdom\u2019s planned split from the European Union is expected to take years, but it\u2019s already creating uncertainty for multinational companies operating in the U. K. including many American firms. Brexit also poses challenges to the U. S. government, as Washington ponders a future in which a key ally has less influence in Europe and likely becomes less relevant on the global stage.",
        "Note: NPR\u2019s First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the Spotify playlist at the bottom of the page. From breakups to moves to midlife crises, major change has done wonders for the creative process. For Okkervil River Will Sheff, there\u2019s no hiding the impact of transition on his new album, which goes so far as to open with a track titled \u201dOkkervil River R. I.",
        "Summer is winding down, but when members of Congress return to Washington from their vacations next week, many of their constituents want them to do something about the mosquitoes \u2014 the ones carrying Zika virus, to be specific. A new survey shows that three quarters of Americans say Congress should make the allocation of more money to deal with the Zika outbreaks in Florida and Puerto Rico an \u201dimportant\u201d or \u201dtop priority\u201d when they return to Washington.",
        "A zombie flick is smashing box office records in South Korea. Train to Busan has been seen by an estimated 11 million Koreans \u2014 a fifth of the population \u2014 and broken numerous records, including the highest ticket sales in Korean film history. The plot isn\u2019t complicated: Everyday South Koreans find themselves trapped on a speeding bullet train with zombies, creating the kind of claustrophobic feel that freshens up the zombie trope. But beyond a summer thriller, it\u2019s also an extended critique of Korean society."
