        "Every day, thousands of teens attempt suicide in the U. S. \u2014 the most extreme outcome for the millions of children in this country who struggle with mental health issues. As we\u2019ve reported all week, schools play a key role, along with parents and medical professionals, in identifying children who may be at risk of suicide. And one of the biggest challenges: myths that can cloud their judgment. \u201dPeople are afraid of the whole topic,\u201d says David Jobes, the head of Catholic University\u2019s Suicide Prevention Lab.",
        "Hillary Clinton told FBI investigators no one at the State Department raised concerns with her about using private email servers to conduct government business during her time as secretary of state. Clinton repeatedly told investigators she relied on seasoned professionals at the department to ensure that classified information was handled properly. And she insisted her use of the private server was for convenience, not an attempt to evade Freedom of Information Act requests or government laws.

Mosquitoes, after all, can carry West Nile and Zika, and four cases of Zika were recently confirmed in the county.

        "It\u2019s ladies night at the Centennial Gun Club in a suburb of Denver. More than 80 women are here for safety instruction and target practice. Tonight the club is offering more than shooting, though. The women rotate through the firing range, and in another large room, they hear a sobering presentation from emergency room doctor Emmy Betz. She\u2019s part of a collaboration between gun shops and public health leaders in the state to help prevent suicide. \u201dIf you\u2019ve been touched by suicide somehow, if you could, raise your hand,\u201d she asks. About half the hands go up.",
        "When I moved from California to Calcutta in 2011, I would joke that I had merely exchanged one Cal for another. It was not technically true. Calcutta, the bustling metropolis where I was born, once the First City of the British Raj, had already rechristened itself as Kolkata in 2001. The British left India in 1947, but they left behind quite a bit of baggage \u2014 starchy clubs with antiquated dress codes completely unsuitable for Indian weather, a passion for cricket and English and Anglicized names.",

The north pole looks totally different from the rest of the planet. \u201dIt\u2019s bluer in color up there than other parts of the planet, and there are a lot of storms,\u201d Scott Bolton, principal investigator of Juno from the Southwest Research Institute, says in a NASA statement on Friday. \u201dThis image is hardly recognizable as Jupiter,\u201d he says.",
        "If you know Theo Jansen\u2019s strandbeests, then you surely have in mind images of mammoth, artificial creatures \u2014 made of PVC, plastic ties and bottles \u2014 roaming the northern beaches of the Netherlands on the watch for rising seas. The strandbeests are like an elephantine Cat Patrol, right out of The King\u2019s Stilts by Dr. Seuss. But this is decidedly not what you\u2019ll encounter at Strandbeest: The Dream Machines of Theo Jansen at San Francisco\u2019s Exploratorium, in its final weekend on exhibit.",

The scientists who discovered it off the coast of northern Australia say they\u2019re surprised by its vast size \u2014 and by the strange shapes. \u201dWhen the shape of them was revealed, it was really surprising,\u201d lead author Mardi McNeil of the University of Queensland tells the Australian broadcaster ABC. \u201dThey form these fields of structures . ..",

Gutierrez, who was born in Mexico and is of Latinos for Trump, said to MSNBC, \u201dMy culture is a very dominant culture. It is imposing and it\u2019s causing problems.\u201d Then he said the line that started a hashtag: \u201dIf you don\u2019t do something about it, you\u2019re going to have taco trucks [on] every corner.\u201d Cue the memes.",

His cartel \u2014 based in Medellin, Colombia \u2014 ruled in the 1980s and at one point supplied 80 percent of the cocaine coming into the U. S. The drama and danger of those days is captured in the Netflix series Narcos. Brazilian actor Wagner Moura plays Escobar in the series, and at the time it was a surprising casting choice.",

        "The U. S. has set a new record for how much gasoline the country consumes in a month. Drivers burned more than 405 million gallons of gas a day in June, the latest month counted. The Energy Information Administration says that\u2019s the highest amount ever, on records dating back to 1946.

As a result, readers sent me tweets providing more \u201devidence\u201d \u2014 this time, that her eyes point in different directions.
