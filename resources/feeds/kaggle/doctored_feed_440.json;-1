They stand in front of a door that\u2019s been locked to them since early August. The sign out front says \u201dChildren\u2019s Clinic\u201d in both English and Arabic. The sign is now peeling away.

        "There are enormous implications in a report this week from a team of Hungarian scientists who say that dogs can understand words. Not just the tone in which we may tell them, \u201dAww, good boy! Good little girl!\u201d Scientists at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University in Budapest wrote in the Science journal that the 13 family dogs they studied use the same parts of their brain as humans to process language. They probably understand words. This is not just a cute li\u2019l pet story. It might lead to rethinking the whole relationship we have with the dogs in our lives.",

But the woman born Lauren Pritchard wants you to know that she does still care \u2014 about some things. \u201dThe meaning of the title is, I grew up in a really small town in Tennessee, and it\u2019s sort of the buckle of the Bible Belt,\u201d she says. \u201dAnd I always tried to be a good, sweet little Southern girl, but I wasn\u2019t.",

And more states could decriminalize marijuana this year. But if you play in the NFL and you use weed it could cost you your job.
