He was out of breath every few minutes and had to sit down. \u201dMy wife told me I had to get to the gym and lose weight,\u201d he says. He had dieted most of his life. \u201dI\u2019ve probably lost 1, 000 pounds over the years,\u201d says White, a realtor in North Myrtle Beach, N. C. But he put most of it back on.

        "Women have been breaking all sorts of glass ceilings recently. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, U. S. women took home more gold medals than anybody else. Beyonc\u00e9 was nominated for 11 VMA awards this year and took home eight, setting a record for VMA wins (and the #BeyHive rejoiced). And of course, this summer Hillary Clinton became the first woman to be nominated for president by a major political party. That\u2019s never happened in our nation\u2019s 240 year history. And for everyday working women, a lot has changed for the better, too.",

        "North Carolina is the ultimate battleground turf this election season. Barack Obama narrowly won the state in 2008 by fewer than 15, 000 votes, but he lost it in 2012.

Polls show Clinton consistently capturing upwards of 90 percent of support from nationally.",
        "At 4. 9 percent, the nation\u2019s unemployment rate is half of what it was at the height of the Great Recession. But that number hides a big problem: Millions of men in their prime working years have dropped out of the workforce \u2014 meaning they aren\u2019t working or even looking for a job. It\u2019s a trend that\u2019s held true for decades and has economists puzzled. In the 1960s, nearly 100 percent of men between the ages of 25 and 54 worked. That\u2019s fallen over the decades.",

It\u2019s in the stairwell of a former convent called Grace House, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan \u2014 a pretty unlikely place, even for Haring.

        "Wherever you look, this is the year of white males \u2014 or, as Donald Trump describes them, \u201dthe smart, smart, smart people that don\u2019t have the big education.\u201d Who are they, and why are they sticking with Trump even as other voters are peeling away?

It\u2019s one of several reasons I never liked wireless Bluetooth headphones. They\u2019re smaller and even easier to lose. But, if the rumors are true \u2014 and most likely they are \u2014 Apple is about to get rid of the headphone jack on its latest smartphone, the iPhone 7, and tip the scales toward wireless Bluetooth headphones.",

        "For many teenage girls, nothing is more sensitive than the way they feel about their appearance. In South Africa, race has been added to that delicate equation. Last month, black students at the prestigious Pretoria High School for Girls protested a clause in the school\u2019s code of conduct that banned wide cornrows, braids and dreadlocks.

        "When the iconic sandstone formation known as \u201dthe duckbill\u201d collapsed, the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department wasn\u2019t suspicious. Erosion happens. Rocks fall. The stretch of cliff where the formation was located, in Cape Kiwanda State Natural Area, was so unstable it was fenced off to keep visitors away.
