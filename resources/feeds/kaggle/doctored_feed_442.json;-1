        "Saline nose spray is becoming increasingly popular as a treatment for allergies and sinus problems. And a study suggests the cheap, simple solution helps with severe nosebleeds, too. Two studies published Tuesday in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association, used saline nose spray as a control when testing medications to treat severe nosebleeds caused by a rare genetic condition. None of the drugs were any better than the saline spray at preventing nosebleeds. But the participants in the U. S. study said their nosebleeds were much less severe \u2014 even if they were just using the saline.",
        "This school year, the University of Chicago has put the debate over \u201dtrigger warnings\u201d on campus back in the news. The University told incoming freshmen that, because of its commitment to freedom of expression, it does not support warnings to students about potentially difficult material. But amid all the attention to trigger warnings, there have been very few facts about exactly how common they are and how they\u2019re used. NPR Ed sent out a survey last fall to faculty members at colleges and universities around the country.",
        "Apple had waited many years to send its very first tweet. It finally happened on Wednesday, with a release of a sponsored tweet promoting the new iPhone 7: \u201dNew cameras. . Stereo speakers. Longer battery life.\u201d Except \u2014 oops! \u2014 CEO Tim Cook had yet to announce the new version of the smartphone. When he finally did, he said, as always: \u201dIt\u2019s the best iPhone that we have ever created.\u201d The speculation about the new features on the phone proved largely true.",
        "Luis Videgaray, Mexico\u2019s M. I. T. minister of finance and confidant of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, has resigned in a move widely seen as fallout from Donald Trump\u2019s visit to that country last week. Pe\u00f1a Nieto made the announcement in Mexico City, but he gave no reason for the change, nor did he say whether Videgaray, a key aide since 2005, would receive a new post. According to the Associated Press, Videgaray was the \u201darchitect\u201d of Trump\u2019s visit to Mexico. The Republican presidential candidate is wildly unpopular there, given his characterizations of Mexican immigrants in the U. S.",
        "In the swing state of North Carolina, a fight for early voting rights that seemed to end with a strongly worded federal court ruling last month, may be just getting started. That fight began in 2013, when the state made cuts to early voting, created a photo ID requirement and eliminated registration, voting, and of high school students. More than half of all voters there use early voting, and do so at higher rates than whites. also tend to overwhelmingly vote for Democrats. In July of this year, the 4th U. S.",
        "Summer may be over, but in France the uproar over beaches banning the Muslim bathing suit, known as the burkini, is not. In fact, the debate has morphed into an even bigger discussion about the place of Islam in this staunchly secular nation. About 30 French towns tried to ban the burkini on their beaches this summer. One by one, French courts overturned many of the bans, calling them unconstitutional. But that didn\u2019t stop the former French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, from throwing his full support behind them.",
        "The Dominican Republic has identified nearly 1, 000 pregnant women suspected of being infected with the Zika virus. Haiti, which shares the same island, has identified only 22. \u201dThere\u2019s no reason to believe that the mosquito will behave differently here [in Haiti] than in the Dominican Republic,\u201d says Dr. Jean Luc Poncelet, the World Health Organization\u2019s representative in . Why are the numbers so dramatically different? Dr. Louise Ivers, with the nonprofit Partners in Health, which runs the largest teaching hospital in Haiti, is concerned that Zika is spreading as a silent epidemic.",
        "A federal judge has granted part of a Native American tribe\u2019s emergency request to halt construction of a section of oil pipeline in North Dakota. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe fears the pipeline could contaminate its drinking water and sacred lands, as we\u2019ve reported. U. S. District Judge James E. Boasberg\u2019s temporary restraining order is \u201da mixed victory for both sides,\u201d as The Bismarck Tribune wrote.

        "North Korea and South Korea maintain strict separation most everywhere in the world. Yet oddly, one of the few places they intersect is Laos, the small, communist nation that\u2019s long had ties with the North and now has growing links with the South. \u201dAs strange as it sounds, Laos is kind of this remote battleground for politics or competition and diplomacy,\u201d says Sokeel Park, research director for Liberty in North Korea, a private South Korean organization that assists North Korean refugees. Laos rarely receives international attention.",
        "Say you want to escape the doldrums of daily life \u2014 but you can\u2019t quite afford a trip to Hawaii. Why not to head to your local tiki bar for a sample of the South Seas? These rum palaces that were all the rage in the 1960s are now making a comeback. Leading this movement are Lost Lake and Three Dots and a Dash in Chicago, Lei Low in Houston and Latitude 29 in New Orleans. The newest, hippest establishment in Washington, D.

        "White House rivals Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are bringing out the brass, in hopes some military polish will burnish their own national security credentials. Clinton today released a list of 95 retired generals and admirals who have endorsed her presidential bid. Trump released a similar list on Tuesday, featuring 88 retired officers. The military arms race comes as the candidates are preparing for a \u201d \u201d forum tonight on NBC.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign has built a massive spending advantage over Donald Trump in critical swing states heading into Election Day \u2014 a widening disparity that worries Republicans not just for the presidential race but also in the battle for the Senate. According to figures provided to NPR by a Republican source tracking ad buys, the GOP presidential nominee is on pace to be heavily outspent in seven presidential and Senate battlegrounds by $127 million to $18 million. Those numbers represent airtime already purchased or reserved from July 26 through Nov. 8.",
        "World War II pilot Elaine Harmon, who died last year at the age of 95, wanted to be laid to rest with her fellow veterans at Arlington National Cemetery. And on Wednesday, Harmon\u2019s wish was fulfilled \u2014 thanks to a dedicated effort by her family and a law passed by Congress. Harmon was one of the Women Airforce Service Pilots, a group of female pilots who flew military planes in noncombat missions in order to free up male pilots for fighting.",
        "Thirteen Natalie Giorgi probably didn\u2019t know the name of the company that makes EpiPen. But the Sacramento, Calif. girl\u2019s death from a allergy attack in 2013 inspired passage of the California law that made the Mylan product a staple at every school in the state. It was Giorgi\u2019s story, not industry lobbying, that state Senate Minority Leader Bob Huff says inspired him to usher through the requirement that public schools stock the injectors. He says he was also influenced by one of his staffers, who has a child with allergies.",

        "The Pentagon press secretary, Peter Cook, walked into the Pentagon briefing room on the afternoon of Aug. 1 with an announcement: The U. S. had just launched airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Libya. Reporters in the room jumped in with questions: Why now? What are the targets? What\u2019s the end goal? Finally, well into Cook\u2019s briefing, a reporter raised her hand and asked, under what legal authority were the strikes being conducted? \u201dUnder the 2001 Authorization for the Military Force,\u201d Cook replied. \u201dSimilar to our previous airstrikes in Libya.\u201d The press conference moved quickly on.",

        "Clearly, researchers love Facebook, even if some of the rest of us are ambivalent. A 2012 survey of social science papers related to the social network turned up 412 separate studies, and there have been even more since. Among the most popular questions: What effect does Facebook have on emotional states? It does seem a reasonable question. After all, about 22 percent of the world\u2019s population uses Facebook regularly, according to the company, logging on for about 50 minutes a day. But is all this interconnectedness creating psychological benefits or global gloom? The answer, it turns out, is complicated.",
        "Human rights lawyers in China have defended some of the country\u2019s most dispossessed citizens: migrant laborers, ethnic and religious minorities, victims of land grabs, and of course, political dissidents. Now these attorneys face an even tougher challenge: defending themselves. Government prosecutors are preparing to try another batch of rights lawyers, charged with crimes of subversion. Since July 2015, authorities have arrested or questioned most of the country\u2019s estimated 300 rights lawyers. The trials appear part of a larger effort by the government to quash challenges to its authority from civil society. One of those awaiting trial is Xie Yanyi.",
        "Most populations of humpback whales no longer need endangered species protections, according to a decision by the National Marine Fisheries Service. The U. S. government listed all humpback whales as endangered back in 1970, after commercial whaling had drastically reduced their numbers. But now, officials say they have divided humpback whales into 14 distinct populations. And after a scientific review, they say that nine of those populations have recovered enough that they no longer need to be considered endangered.",

        "Brian Fallon starts to answer the question. \u201dIt\u2019s funny, because. ..\u201d He trails off, and then tries again. \u201dAnd it. .. uh. ..\u201d He laughs. Fallon has a solo record out. His band, The Gaslight Anthem, went on hiatus last year, and since then he\u2019s fathered a second child. The question was about how having children changed him and his songwriting. A softball question, sure, and one any songwriter would\u2019ve been asked enough times in interviews to make them question their decision to procreate at all.",
        "Fifteen years after the attacks of Sept. 11, Americans have grown aware not only of the danger of terrorism but also of the reality that their nation is far less white, Christian and European than it used to be. \u201dCulturally, we\u2019re a country of Bollywood and bhangra and tai chi and yoga and salsa and burritos and halal and kosher,\u201d says Diana Eck, professor of comparative religion at Harvard University and author of A New Religious America.",

        "On Aug. 15, the news broke that a Russian radio telescope detected strong signals from outer space. The signals allegedly originated from a star 95 from Earth. Just to clarify, this means that the signal would have left the star or, potentially, an orbiting planet, 95 years ago. Radio waves \u2014 as do any electromagnetic wave including visible light \u2014 travel in empty space at the speed of light, about 186, 000 miles per second.

        "Updated at 7:20 p. m. ET. A rocket took off Thursday evening from Cape Canaveral, Fla. as part of a mission by NASA and the University of Arizona to send a robot to an asteroid. The goal: Bring back ancient dust. The asteroid is called Bennu, and it\u2019s basically a giant rubble pile, shaped something like a spinning top. But it\u2019s a very special rubble pile. Scientists believe it has been moving through space untouched for about 4. 5 billion years, making it a time capsule from when our solar system was just starting to form.",
        "Like so many brilliant innovations, the idea seems obvious in hindsight. Just combine college, coffee, and chemical engineering. Of course! But no one, apparently, hit upon this magic formula until a few years ago, when William Ristenpart and Tonya Kuhl, two engineering professors at the University of California, Davis, started discussing ways to give young undergraduates a introduction to their new discipline."
