        "Alarmed Russians are sharing photos on social media of a Siberian river that has suddenly and mysteriously turned blood red. Russian authorities are trying to determine the cause of the ominous change to the Daldykan River, located above the Arctic Circle and flowing through the mining town of Norilsk. Photos posted on Facebook by the Association of the Indigenous Peoples of the Taimir Peninsula clearly show the river has turned a vivid red. As National Geographic reported, two major theories are emerging to explain the change.",
        "When a disaster of unfathomable scope strikes your city and its central symbol of prosperity has been leveled to ruin \u2014 and it\u2019s your job to jolt it into resurgence \u2014 where do you begin? Only hours had passed after the planes struck New York City\u2019s twin towers on Sept.",
        "For many of us, Sept. 11, 2001, is one of those touchstone dates \u2014 we remember exactly where we were when we heard that the planes hit the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. I was in Afghanistan. I\u2019d arrived in Kabul on Sept. 9 to cover the trial of eight foreign aid workers who had been arrested by the Taliban regime, which accused them of preaching Christianity to Afghans. Proselytizing was a death penalty crime, and two Americans were among the accused.",
        "Things are far from normal for people in Louisiana hit by last month\u2019s historic flood. Thousands have lost their homes, their cars, their jobs. But one routine resumed this week in Baton Rouge: Students are back in class after a interruption. At Claiborne Elementary in north Baton Rouge, kids are tussling on school playgrounds again, even as their families\u2019 soaked belongings lay in heaps along neighborhood streets. Every available space at the school has been converted to a classroom. The campus is now hosting students displaced from Howell Park Elementary, about 2 miles away.",
        ", Between 2 percent and 5 percent of women say they use marijuana while pregnant, according to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. And while harm to the fetus is certainly plausible since the drug crosses the placenta, the evidence has been spotty. Now a review and analysis of 31 previously published studies has found no independent connection between a mother\u2019s pot use and adverse birth events. But the doctors say that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s OK to partake. Based on unadjusted data, the review found a link between marijuana use and both low birth weight and preterm delivery.",
        "If you\u2019ve ever wanted to watch a superbug evolve before your very eyes, you\u2019re in luck. Researchers filmed an experiment that created bacteria a thousand times more than their ancestors. In the video, a white bacterial colony creeps across an enormous black petri dish plated with vertical bands of successively higher doses of antibiotic. The colony pauses when it hits the first band of antibiotic, creating a stark border between the white colony and the black petri dish. Then the bacteria start to edge their way into the toxic soup.",
        "Good novels are like good parties: You get the right mix of people together, and you never quite know what will happen. In Ann Patchett\u2019s new novel Commonwealth, a christening party takes a turn when one guest arrives with a bottle of gin. The gin leads to a wonderfully sloppy afternoon with cocktail mixing, a dancing priest, and two adulterous kisses. The kisses lead to divorces, and a new blended family, six kids bouncing back and forth between Southern California and Virginia. The book follows them for 50 years.",
        "Former Secretary of State Colin Powell used a personal computer connected to a private telephone line to send and receive emails to staffers, friends and foreign leaders without having to go through State Department servers. Powell shared that experience with Hillary Clinton two days after she took over as secretary of state. Powell cautioned Clinton to \u201dbe very careful,\u201d lest her emails be discovered and become part of the official State Department record. \u201dI got around it by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data,\u201d Powell wrote to Clinton in January of 2009.",
        "In story posted on the popular Facebook page Humans of New York, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton likened perceptions that she is \u201dcold\u201d or \u201dunemotional\u201d to having to learn to control her emotions as a young woman. Clinton recounted taking a law school admissions test and having a group of men taunt the women. According to Clinton, they yelled things like \u201dYou don\u2019t need to be here\u201d and \u201dthere\u2019s plenty else you can do.\u201d \u201dOne of them even said: \u2019If you take my spot, I\u2019ll get drafted, and I\u2019ll go to Vietnam, and I\u2019ll die,\u2019\u201d the post reads.",

But Perez y Martina \u2014 which tells the tale of a romance between a cockroach and a mouse \u2014 isn\u2019t just any children\u2019s story.

        "Percussionist and bandleader Willie Bobo had a remarkable career that not only reflected his background, but also created a hybrid that still reflects the life of Latinos living in this country. Still, he rarely gets enough credit for his role in the development of bugaloo, Latin jazz, and then Latin soul. This week on Alt. Latino, we change that when we talk to his son, Eric Bobo, about a new collection of material, released this week with the title Dig My Feeling.",
        "The Rio Olympics are in the mirror. Thousands of athletes have returned home to resume their lives. But for many, this period can be a rough one, with depression and anxiety haunting them after the games. That depression can affect both stars and athletes alike. Swimmer Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time, has talked candidly about his downward spiral after the 2012 London games that led to a DUI arrest and time in rehab.",
        "Wells Fargo Bank has been ordered to pay $185 million in fines and penalties to settle what the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau calls \u201dthe widespread illegal practice of secretly opening unauthorized deposit and credit card accounts.\u201d Thousands of Wells Fargo employees opened the accounts in secret so they would get bonuses for hitting their sales targets, according to investigators. More than 2 million deposit and credit card accounts may have been created without customer authorization. The bank must pay $100 million to the CFPB \u2014 the largest fine ever levied by the federal consumer watchdog.",
        "Almost half of all Americans take prescription painkillers, tranquilizers, stimulants or sedatives, according to results of a federal survey released Thursday. The prevalent use of these drugs could help explain why millions of Americans end up misusing or abusing them. Last year, for the first time, the government\u2019s National Survey on Drug Use decided to ask the people it interviewed about all uses of prescription medicines, not just inappropriate use. The survey found that 119 million Americans age 12 and over took prescription psychotherapeutic drugs. That\u2019s 45 percent of the population.",
        "The boats are owned by Americans. They fly American flags and work in American waters. The fish they catch \u2014 like premium ahi tuna and swordfish \u2014 is sold at American grocery stores, on shelves at Whole Foods and Costco. But the men who catch those fish can\u2019t set foot on American soil, The Associated Press reports \u2014 and they aren\u2019t protected by American labor laws. For more than a year, the AP has been reporting on labor abuses in the global fishing industry. Previous stories have resulted in thousands of slaves being rescued in Indonesia.",
        "Note: NPR\u2019s First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the Spotify playlist at the bottom of the page. So far, Dawes has made its name with a sumptuous take on classic Americana. You\u2019d barely know it, though, by listening to the band\u2019s fifth and latest We\u2019re All Gonna Die. The rolling, pastoral twang that Taylor Goldsmith has cultivated since Dawes\u2019 debut, 2009\u2019s North Hills, is evident in bursts and flashes on the new album, but there\u2019s something more sprawling here.",
        "You\u2019ve heard it a bajillion times at this point: Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are the two most unpopular major party presidential candidates on record. Both of them have unfavorability ratings of more than 50 percent. But here\u2019s one more place that unpopularity pops up: the number of people who simply don\u2019t choose either candidate. Especially when you compare this election with 2012, a massive number of people are either choosing candidates or simply have not yet decided.",
        "Donald Trump would have \u201da very good relationship with many foreign leaders,\u201d he said Wednesday at NBC\u2019s candidate forum, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. That\u2019s important, he said, because better ties with Moscow would let the U. S. and Russia work together to fight the Islamic State. \u201dAnd, you know, the beautiful part of getting along?\u201d Trump asked. \u201dRussia wants to defeat ISIS as badly as we do.\u201d Is it true that Russia \u201dwants to defeat ISIS\u201d as badly as the U. S. does? No.",
        "At a candidate forum Wednesday night, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump explained their policies on ground troops, fighting ISIS and other issues related to the military. We\u2019ve recapped five key moments here and more deeply examined two claims, one from each candidate, below. The claims: Clinton vowed to refrain from putting troops on the ground in Iraq, while Trump claimed that a court system to prosecute sexual assault in the military \u201dpractically doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d The Claim, \u201dWe\u2019re not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again.\u201d The Question, Clinton vowed on Wednesday that the U. S.",
        "A couple of months ago I was at Washington, D. C.\u2019s Union Market, where dozens of food vendors sell their wares, when I spotted the word falooda at one of the small stalls. Falooda is a cold, textured dessert or snack that was a regular part of my childhood summers back in India. And this was the first time in America that I had seen a mention of this beloved dessert. I was thrilled and promptly joined the line to order some.",
        "Dogs can be trained to do a multitude of tasks. Most can learn to sit, lie and stay others can guide the blind, rescue the injured and maybe even detect cancer. But the hardest thing of all might be to train them to do nothing. Stop scratching. Don\u2019t wag your tail. Don\u2019t drool. Don\u2019t even lick your chops. My dog can heed the command \u201dstay\u201d for a total of about four seconds. And that\u2019s on a good day.",
        "Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson asked a television interviewer Thursday, \u201dWhat is Aleppo?\u201d betraying a lack of interest or even superficial knowledge of the civil war in Syria that has been raging for more than five years. The question came during an interview on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe. Panelist Mike Barnicle asked the Libertarian nominee and former governor of New Mexico, \u201dWhat would you do if you were elected, about Aleppo?\u201d At first, Barnicle thought Johnson was joking \u2014 replying with \u201dyou\u2019re kidding\u201d \u2014 when Johnson didn\u2019t recognize the city.",
        "Today in the skies over New Mexico, Air Force students are practicing for the kill. They sit at terminals at Holloman Air Force Base, watching grainy images from a drone video feed. Thousands of feet below, at a desert training range, role players portray civilians and fighters inside a village. The students must find the proper target, then with a push of a button, they unleash a simulated airstrike. This new world of aerial combat began in the early morning hours of Oct. 7, 2001. Air Force Lt. Gen.",
        "At a news conference in Geneva late Friday, U. S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced the beginnings of a peace plan for Syria, reports NPR\u2019s Alice Fordham. Kerry was joined in the announcement by Sergey Lavrov, Russia\u2019s foreign minister. \u201dThe United States is going the extra mile here because we believe that Russia, and my colleague, have the capability to press the [Bashar] Assad regime to stop this conflict and come to the table and make peace,\u201d Kerry said. The deal will be implemented at sundown on Monday, Lavrov said.",
        "A ticking time bomb. That\u2019s what some health officials say the Zika virus is in Southeast Asia. In the past two weeks, an outbreak in Singapore has climbed from a few dozen cases to nearly 300. \u201dThey\u2019re starting to have a situation in Singapore, which is really quite worrying,\u201d Dr. Anthony Fauci from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said at a recent meeting on Zika at Georgetown University Law Center. And it\u2019s true. Southeast Asia has all the right ingredients for a massive Zika outbreak. It\u2019s home to more than 600 million people.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin is again stirring up controversy after he gave an interview Thursday to Russian Television. Trump talked to former CNN host Larry King, who now hosts a show on RT America, for about 10 minutes. The Republican candidate again cast doubt on whether Russia was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee, a belief at odds with U. S. intelligence officials. That\u2019s also despite having encouraged Russia to \u201dfind\u201d Clinton\u2019s emails just six weeks ago.",
        "This week on the campaign trail, Donald Trump and his surrogates are being haunted by the ghost of comments past. Specifically, allegations the Republican presidential nominee made five years ago that President Obama lied about his birthplace to make him eligible for the presidency. (Obama was born in Hawaii.) It\u2019s a theory that those close to Trump \u2014 who was one of the most \u201dbirthers\u201d \u2014 have tried to distance from the candidate. On Friday, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo that the GOP nominee no longer believes what he once did.",
        "It all began with a shawl. The year was 1993. Jacqueline de Chollet, a Swiss woman then in her 50s, was on vacation in India when she stopped at a dusty village and saw a woman in a house weaving a shawl. \u201dShe had three or four children including a baby she was nursing in her arms,\u201d de Chollet recalls. \u201dAnd she looked way older than her age.\u201d Hoping to provide a little help, de Chollet offered to buy the shawl.",
        "There is a church in Florence where women and girls are asked to put on a blue robe if their dress is considered too revealing. It is no doubt an accident that the blue of the gown perfectly matches the blue of the painted night sky of the small cupola in the old chapel and also the blue field of color in a Ghirlandaio painting that hangs near by. Far from concealing these church visitors, the effect, rather, is to draw the eye and throw them into architectural relief."
