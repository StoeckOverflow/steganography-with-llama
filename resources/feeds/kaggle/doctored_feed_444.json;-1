        "Sunday marks the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in Washington, D. C. New York City and Pennsylvania. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have made Sept. 11 a recurring theme in their campaigns, but both say they will stay off the campaign trail that day and will not visit ground zero in New York City. Here is a look at current players in the political landscape and where they were in their political careers on Sept. 11, 2001.",
        "A stack of folders with the names of construction workers, police and firefighters, and volunteers rests at John Feal\u2019s feet. In his tidy home office in Nesconset, N. Y. Feal checks their spelling before he can send names to the engraver, who will put them on his memorial wall. One of Feal\u2019s feet was crushed by 8, 000 pounds of steel as he dug through the rubble of the World Trade Center. He considers himself blessed to have months in the hospital while other Sept. 11 responders inhaled toxic dust on the job.",
        "What if doctors could call up a computerized map that would show them how a case of cancer is likely to progress? Tumor cells can mutate in unexpected ways. And cancers can suddenly grow. For doctors, anticipating cancer\u2019s next moves can help guide timely, effective patient treatment. A mapping program, called PiCnIc for short, aims to help physicians in staying a step ahead of cancer and preparing treatment plans with fewer elements of surprise. How does it work?",
        "High school students and young adults are much less likely to use illicit drugs than their parents, according to data released Thursday. And compared to baby boomers, young adults today look like outright angels. Except for their acceptance of marijuana, that is. This report comes from a running, study of drug, tobacco and alcohol use from the University of Michigan. This most recent iteration shows that people in their 40s and 50s used far more drugs in their youth than do people in their teens and 20s today.",
        "You have to sympathize with the makers of Sully, director Clint Eastwood and screenwriter Todd Komarnicki. The focus of their story is Capt. Chesley \u201dSully\u201d Sullenberger\u2019s aborted Jan. 15, 2009, flight, which lasted only 208 seconds. He flew out of New York\u2019s LaGuardia, hit a flock of geese, and made an unprecedented landing on the Hudson River, saving all 155 passengers and crew members. There was more, of course. He and the flight attendants had to help get frightened passengers onto the wings, and the Coast Guard had to pick people up before they froze.",
        "NASA sent a robotic spacecraft from Florida out to an asteroid Thursday, but that\u2019s not the only asteroid mission the space agency has in the works. Officials also want to study a different asteroid with the help of astronauts. And it looks like the next president, plus Congress, will have to decide whether this human mission to a flying rock should ever get off the ground. The idea of visiting an asteroid goes back to 2010, when President Obama went to Kennedy Space Center in Florida to lay out his new plan for space exploration.",
        "China was rattled physically and politically Friday by North Korea\u2019s nuclear test, its second this year and fifth overall. It caused a magnitude 5. 3 seismic event that caused strong tremors in towns and cities on the border between the two countries, according to the Chinese media. But as with previous tests, it\u2019s unlikely to provoke a strong Chinese response.",
        "Updated 11:15 a. m. ET, North Korea confirmed it has conducted its fifth test of a nuclear weapon, the second this year. The test occurred Friday morning local time and triggered a magnitude 5. 3 seismic event. The North\u2019s state TV said the test \u201dexamined and confirmed\u201d the design of a nuclear warhead intended for placement on a ballistic missile. It said there was no leakage of radioactivity. China\u2019s Ministry of Environmental Protection said radiation levels in its border region with North Korea were normal.",
        "Updated at 2:15 p. m. ET, To Norwegian author Tom Egeland, it was one of the most significant war photos ever taken. To Facebook, it was a \u201ddisplay of nudity.\u201d The social media site\u2019s removal of the image sparked an uproar \u2014 and, on Friday, the company announced it was reversing course and would be reinstating the image. Last month, Egeland used the platform to post the iconic photo of a girl, screaming and naked, fleeing napalm bombs during the Vietnam War.",
        "On Sept. 11, 2001, two men arrived at the ticket counter late for American Airlines Flight 77 out of Dulles International Airport. This was before the days of the Transportation Security Administration, when airport security was quite different from what it is today. At the time, the man working at the counter, Vaughn Allex, followed procedure and checked them through. Those two men were among the five hijackers who crashed that flight into the Pentagon \u2014 killing 189 people, including themselves.",
        "London Road is not the first musical to be made about a serial killer. But it may be the first to draw its poetic from the testimony of residents of a rural English town where five prostitutes were found murdered in 2006. Aside from a wicked moment or two when a leering movie star known for playing unsavory fellows shows up to throw us off the scent, this is not about the murderer. It\u2019s about the undoing \u2014 and remaking \u2014 of a community in its own words, owing more to Shirley Jackson than Masterpiece Theater.",
        "Note: NPR\u2019s First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the Spotify playlist at the bottom of the page. Amanda Shires has a way of pausing over a note and pulling it in a few directions. Some have called this a warble, others a catch. In \u201dHarmless,\u201d a torch song from her new fourth album, My Piece of Land, Shires employs this instrument of indeterminacy while describing the beginning of a risky relationship: \u201d \u201d she intones after each phrase about spilling a drink or admiring this stranger\u2019s eyes.",

        "It took two decades to arrange a college football game at Bristol Motor Speedway \u2014 and just 19 days to set up for it. On Saturday night, Tennessee and Virginia Tech are facing off in what\u2019s been dubbed the \u201dBattle at Bristol.\u201d The Associated Press reports the showdown at the speedway \u2014 about halfway between the two schools \u2014 has been discussed for 20 years, and was announced in 2013. But the racetrack, nicknamed \u201dThe Last Great Colosseum,\u201d had less than three weeks to actually transform into a football stadium.",
        "On Thursday night, a series of cable cars traveling over the Mont Blanc Alpine Massif stopped working \u2014 leaving more than 100 tourists stranded, NPR\u2019s Eleanor Beardsley reports. Helicopter crews managed to extract 65 of the trapped people in a delicate rescue operation. But by the time night fell the helicopters had to stop, leaving dozens more people, including a child, dangling in the gondolas overnight. By morning, the cable car system had been repaired and the gondolas were sent into motion again. All the tourists are now safe, The Associated Press reports.",
        "M. I. A. grew up in Sri Lanka, and later in public housing in London. She\u2019s made a career singing and speaking about the social justice issues around refugees and minorities. So it surprised some people when, in an interview this April, she seemed to criticize the Black Lives Matter movement and two musicians: \u201dIs Beyonc\u00e9 or Kendrick Lamar going to say Muslim lives matter?\u201d she said. \u201dOr Syrian lives matter? Or this kid in Pakistan matters?\u201d NPR\u2019s David Greene asked her about those comments.",
        "Memo to candidates: Stop generalizing and psychoanalyzing your opponents\u2019 supporters. It never works out well for you. The latest to fall into that trap is Hillary Clinton. The Democratic nominee, at a New York fundraiser Friday night with liberal donors and Barbra Streisand, said \u201dhalf\u201d of Trump supporters fit into a \u201dbasket of deplorables,\u201d while the other half are people who feel the government has let them down and need understanding and empathy.",
        "Before Scott Kopytko joined the New York City Fire Department, he worked as a commodities broker in the South Tower at the World Trade Center. On Sept. 11, he rushed up the stairs of his old office building, trying to save lives with his fellow firefighters before the towers fell. \u201dHe went to work, and he never came back,\u201d says his stepfather, Russell Mercer. Almost every morning, Mercer and Kopytko\u2019s mother take turns visiting the cemetery across from their son\u2019s old high school in the Queens borough of New York City.",
        "Danny Nolan was the first man to swing a wrecking ball in Manhattan in 25 years. Wrecking balls hadn\u2019t been allowed on the island for a very simple reason: The buildings are much too close together to allow a huge ball to swing back and forth. An exception was made for Nolan because he, and the other construction workers of the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 14, were \u201dworking the pile\u201d \u2014 hauling away what was left in the World Trade Center towers after the Sept. 11 attacks.",
        "Revolutionary discoveries don\u2019t always breakthrough the hustle of daily life. After all, when the Wright Brothers lifted their rickety plane off the sands of Kitty Hawk, the rest of the world was just out buying their eggs, milk and toilet paper. On that day who knew \u2014 or could imagine \u2014 that decades into the future millions of people would be sitting in giant watching Direct TV and soaring five miles above the planet\u2019s surface.",
        "In 2008, Dana Walrath asked her mother Alice to move in with her. Alice\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease had gotten worse, and even though she still had all her humor and graces, she could no longer take care of herself. During the next two years, Walrath and her mother connected through stories and memories, even though Alice didn\u2019t always recognize her daughter. Walrath, a medical anthropologist at the Vermont College of Medicine, in Burlington, Vt. looks back fondly on that time.",
        "The Camp of the Sacred Stone is full of all manner of people \u2014 kids, elders, lawyers, hippies, and representatives of several Native American tribes \u2014 all gathered alongside the Standing Rock Sioux Nation to resist construction of a controversial oil pipeline that would cut across the American heartland. Since construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline brought protesters to the encampment in April, organizers say nearly 200 tribes have offered support. Celebrities, environmentalists, politicians, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement and other activists have joined together to create one of the more unusual coalitions to back a cause.",
        "Donald Trump seems to be running his presidential campaign lately with an old playground adage in mind: I am rubber. You are glue. Whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you. At least, that seemed to be the case at a campaign rally Friday night in Pensacola, Florida. During his speech, several of the more inflammatory attacks lobbed at his opponent appeared to be direct projections of criticisms once aimed at himself. At the rally, Trump said that the only thing Clinton has done well is keeping herself out of trouble.",

It\u2019s a moment that young adult authors know well, and not just because they write for these young readers. They\u2019ve experienced it themselves, and they\u2019ve come out the other side, pen in hand. That\u2019s why we asked a few YA writers for their advice on this difficult phase.",
        "Voters in Maine and a handful of other states are deciding whether to legalize recreational marijuana this November. One thing that could swing the vote is the possibility of millions of dollars in tax revenue from retail marijuana sales. Colorado was the first state in the country to roll out a tax scheme for legal marijuana in 2013, after recreational marijuana was legalized in 2012. So how are voters in Colorado spending the cash, and what should Maine voters expect?",
        "Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate for president, was chagrined and embarrassed this week after he asked, \u201dWhat is Aleppo?\u201d in reply to a question on MSNBC. Mr. Johnson made no excuses and said later he simply \u201dblanked\u201d \u2014 his word \u2014 when asked what he would do about the besieged Syrian city in which hundreds of thousands of civilians are trapped, many starving and defenseless against artillery, bombs and alleged chemical weapons. But it\u2019s not as if the major party candidates for president have brimmed with new ideas about Aleppo, or what the U. S.",
        "Asked on cable news what he would do about Aleppo, the city at the center of the Syrian refugee crisis, Gary Johnson asked, \u201dWhat is Aleppo?\u201d It revealed a surprising lack of foreign policy depth and could cause problems for his candidacy as he seeks to try and make the presidential debate stage.",
        "After marathon talks, and with caveats and reservations, the U. S. and Russia announced a plan for a truce and military coordination in Syria \u2014 and it\u2019s easy to find reasons it could fail. As Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov acknowledged, the agreement sits on a foundation of profound mistrust and comes after a similar effort, introduced in February, gradually fell apart.",
        "Once upon a time, there was a strange little woman who lived in an upside down house. Her name was Mrs. and she was a combination of friend and therapist to all the kids who lived in her small town. Author Betty MacDonald began making up stories about Mrs. Piggle Wiggle for her family in the 1940s those bedtime tales led to a series of classic children\u2019s books. Now, MacDonald\u2019s Annie Parnell has teamed up with Ann M. Martin \u2014 who created the Babysitter\u2019s Club books \u2014 to reboot the series for modern readers."
