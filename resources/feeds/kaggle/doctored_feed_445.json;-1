        "Linda Holmes is filing dispatches from the Toronto International Film Festival. These movies will see wider release in the coming months. Nocturnal Animals, Tom Ford (the fashion designer) surprised a fair number of folks with his very good first feature as a director, A Single Man, in 2009. It was gorgeous to look at, as one might expect, but it was also deeply felt, thanks in part to a strong central performance from Colin Firth. Fast forward to 2016. Ford\u2019s second directorial effort, Nocturnal Animals, based on Austin Wright\u2019s novel Tony Susan, nests one story inside another.",
        "And so, it ended with, very appropriately, a deathly quiet. \u201dFabric is closed. That\u2019s it. Heartwrenching silence around the room.\u201d So read a Tweet by Jeremy Abbott, the digital editor of Mixmag, who was in the room on Tuesday night when the Islington council licensing committee\u2019s met to determine whether the London neighborhood would permanently revoke the operating license of fabric, one of the city\u2019s and most iconic clubs. The issue had come about because of two deaths around club this summer.",
        "A deadly fungus that has been devastating frog populations is spreading across the globe \u201d it has helped drive the extinction of 200 species so far. In California, the chytrid fungus has moved inexorably across the Sierra Nevada, leaving thousands of frogs dead. But scientists are trying to turn the tide against the fungus with an experimental treatment, one that could matter to frogs worldwide. They\u2019re making a effort to save the endangered mountain frog by immunizing it against the fungus.",

        "Updated 2 a. m. ET, Sept. 12, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday, according to a statement issued late Sunday afternoon by her physician, Lisa R. Bardack. The Clinton campaign provided the statement after Clinton was examined at her home in Chappaqua, N. Y. On Sunday morning, Clinton abruptly left a Sept. 11 commemoration ceremony in New York City. Her campaign later said she had \u201dfelt overheated.\u201d Dr. Bardack\u2019s statement reads: \u201dSecretary Clinton has been experiencing a cough related to allergies.",
        "The names of each of the nearly 3, 000 victims of the Sept. 11 attacks were read at a ceremony at the Sept. 11 memorial plaza, at the World Trade Center site in New York City. This marks the 15th anniversary of the attacks. Family members came forward to name and honor their relatives who died at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and on Flight 93. The event also commemorated the victims of the 1993 World Trade Center bombings. As WNYC\u2019s Stephen Nessen told our Newscast unit, family members often included an anecdote or update as well.",
        "Plastic water bottles, brown medicine vials, and foam coffee cups wash up on the beaches of Taiwan\u2019s Kinmen Island. This is the daily tide of garbage from the world\u2019s most populous nation, just 1 mile across the channel. But it wasn\u2019t always garbage that came floating across from mainland China. Communist troops from China\u2019s Red Army stormed this beach in 1949. Thousands of Chinese soldiers who tried to take this island from Taiwan were massacred. \u201dYou see that well?",
        "\u201dNever forget\u201d became a national rallying cry after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Yet America\u2019s schools \u2014 where collective memory is shaped \u2014 are now full of students who never knew. Because they weren\u2019t alive 15 years ago. As such, many teachers struggle with whether and how to teach the attacks and their aftermath. According to one survey, only about 20 states include anything in depth about the events of that fateful day in their high school social studies curriculum. And when they are taught, critics say, it\u2019s often through a narrow lens.",
        "It is tempting to make every fiasco at Facebook about the power (and the abuse of power) of the algorithm. The \u201dnapalm girl\u201d controversy does not neatly fit that storyline. A team of humans at Facebook decided to remove the iconic photo from the site this week. That move revealed, in a klutzy way, just how much the company is struggling internally to exercise the most basic editorial judgment, despite claims by senior leadership that the system is working.",
        "The legal battle over the Texas voter ID law is a fight that just won\u2019t end. The law was passed by the state\u2019s Legislature in 2011. It immediately became one of the strictest photo ID laws in the country. And the law has been in and out of courts ever since. According to civil rights attorney Chad Dunn, the courts ruled that the law is discriminatory. \u201dThere is some considerable evidence that it was adopted with the purpose to prevent certain voters from voting,\u201d Dunn says.",
        "As you open Angel Catbird, Margaret Atwood\u2019s new comic book, your mind may wander through her previous works in search of comparisons and common themes. In her case, that\u2019s quite a trip. Though for more than 40 books of fiction, poetry and essays, she\u2019s also a creator of comics. \u201dIn the seventies I drew a strip called Kanadian Kultchur Komix for a magazine called, puzzlingly, This Magazine,\u201d she writes in Catbird\u2019s introduction.",
        "We all have unlived lives, says writer Margaret Atwood, and for her, that alternate life was becoming an illustrator. \u201dI started drawing comics as a child,\u201d she tells NPR\u2019s Audie Cornish. Atwood grew up reading and enjoying comics and, around age 6, she started drawing a flying cat with wings. But, she says, \u201dI wasn\u2019t good enough. I knew people who were good enough and I could tell the difference.\u201d Now, nearly 70 years later, Atwood\u2019s cat flies again in a graphic novel called Angel Catbird.",

        "Mara Wilson says that the most complicated relationship she has ever had is with a fictional girl. That\u2019s because you probably know Wilson best as Matilda, from the 1996 film adaptation of Roald Dahl\u2019s classic. \u201dI wanted to be her so badly . .. \u201d Wilson tells NPR\u2019s Rachel Martin. \u201dShe\u2019s kind of like my big sister overshadowing me.\u201d Wilson, now 29, was a successful child actress \u2014 you may also recognize her from her starring roles as Natalie Hillard in Mrs. Doubtfire, or as Susan Walker in Miracle on 34th Street.",
        "When describing the cultural history of the Caribbean island of Grenada, it\u2019s the cooking pot rather than the melting pot that springs to mind. And there\u2019s no better culinary metaphor than \u201doil down,\u201d the peculiarly named national dish of Grenada, a mix of meats and vegetables. Nearly every ingredient in this hearty stew has a unique origin and story to tell: For instance, callaloo, a leafy vegetable somewhat similar in taste to spinach, and the same plant\u2019s root, known as dasheen, are indigenous to the Caribbean and were cultivated by Grenada\u2019s earliest Amerindian inhabitants.",

        "When it comes to navigating the intricacies of health insurance, Cassie Ray considers herself a pro. She actually reads her policy, including the fine print. So when the from Fairfield, Calif. needed routine surgery after a mastectomy, she did her homework. \u201dI looked up on my insurer\u2019s network and made sure the outpatient facility that I was being referred to was in my network,\u201d Ray says.

The Festival of Sacrifice, which marks Abraham\u2019s willingness to sacrifice his son, involves days of feasting and celebration.

        "A group of inmates in Texas is suing the state prison system, the nation\u2019s largest, arguing that extreme heat is killing older and infirm convicts. The inmates allege it constitutes \u201dcruel and unusual punishment\u201d and they\u2019re asking the courts for relief.

        "The tables turned for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton over the weekend. For much of the campaign, Clinton has been sitting back, staying quiet and allowing Trump\u2019s gaffes, offensive statements and to take up the news cycle. But then Clinton had a terrible few days. First, she declared that half of all Trump supporters belong to a \u201dbasket of deplorables\u201d that includes racists, sexists, homophobic people and other broadly biased groups \u2014 a soundbite that Trump quickly made into an attack ad. Then she appeared weak and wobbly as she left early during a memorial ceremony commemorating the Sept.",

        "It was just a glimpse, but the scene spoke volumes \u2014 and started a push for help. Joel Cervantes Macias was struck by the sight of an elderly man pushing his cart of frozen treats on Chicago\u2019s 26th Street, so he took a photo.

        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s begrudging release of information related to her health on Sunday follows a pattern set by candidates and many who have won the Oval Office. It is a pattern of secrecy and, in some cases, that would be scandalous if they occurred on other issues of policy. Clinton mysteriously disappeared from public view during the Sept. 11 commemoration in New York City on Sunday. Pool reporters who follow her campaign were not told of her whereabouts for some hours.",

The setting of the film is a recording studio for a performance of songs from Skeleton Tree, the band\u2019s 16th studio album. But the backdrop to the film is tragic. In the summer of 2015, Nick Cave\u2019s son, Arthur, fell from a cliff while hallucinating on LSD. The film was made about five months later. Cave has not spoken at any length about his son, and this film is, in a way, his statement and thoughts on Arthur\u2019s death."
