        "They read a book quietly under their desks, pester the teacher for extra credit, or, perhaps, they simply check out and act up.

        "Artists make the best cultural critics. They reveal what\u2019s happening around us with whatever level of transparency they see fit, with whatever level of opaqueness they desire to sustain mystery. They\u2019re observers, internally and outwardly, operating in a space that allows us, the voyeur, the listener, to learn. Kim Gordon has been teaching us for over three decades.

        "The last time Arizona voters picked a Democrat for president was two decades ago to Bill Clinton in 1996. To find another example, you have to go back even further to 1948 when Harry Truman was running for president. But now that the Hillary Clinton campaign has started investing in the state, it raises the question: Is Arizona actually a swing state this year? Arizona Democrats would like to believe so. They are encouraged by a growing Latino vote that opposes Donald Trump and by polls suggesting a much tighter race than in years past.",

Then the little critters use incisors to slice a deep, tiny wound into a victim\u2019s skin. As blood flows out of the wound, the bat laps it up \u2014 about a tablespoon per bite.
