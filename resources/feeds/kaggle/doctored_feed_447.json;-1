        "A living history museum usually conjures up images of butter churns and anvils. At Den Gamle By (The Old Town) Museum in Aarhus, Denmark, you\u2019ll find all that. But tucked away in one corner of this museum, there\u2019s also something different \u2014 an entire apartment straight out of the 1950s. The \u201dHouse of Memories\u201d is not usually open to the public, and it\u2019s not aimed at schoolchildren sent to learn about a distant and exotic past.

        "For the first time in her life, freelance designer Susannah Lohr had to shop for health insurance this year. She called up a major insurer in the St. Louis area where she lives, and it offered her a plan with a hefty $6, 000 deductible \u2014 that\u2019s the amount she would have to cover herself before the insurance kicks in.

        "I fell for pho in Saigon in 1974, when I was 5 years old. When my family came to America in 1975, my mom satisfied our family\u2019s cravings for the aromatic beef noodle soup with homemade batches, served on Sundays after morning Mass. As Vietnamese expatriates, we savored pho as a very special food, a gateway to our cultural roots. When we didn\u2019t have pho at home, we went out for it in Orange County, California\u2019s Little Saigon, patronizing shops that welcomed us with the perfume of pho broth.",

That describes the reaction of many Americans this week following revelations that, 50 years ago, the sugar industry paid Harvard scientists for research that downplayed sugar\u2019s role in heart disease \u2014 and put the spotlight squarely on dietary fat. What might surprise consumers is just how many nutrition studies are still funded by the food industry. Nutrition scholar Marion Nestle of New York University spent a year informally tracking studies on food. \u201dRoughly 90% of nearly 170 studies favored the sponsor\u2019s interest,\u201d Nestle tells us via email. Other, systematic reviews support her conclusions.",

And yet, she says she never wanted to be known \u201djust as a soccer player.\u201d \u201dI knew at some point that that identity would come to an end, and if I stripped that identity away, what then?

        "\u201dTupac wasn\u2019t cool.\u201d It felt sacrilegious to even hear my brother say those words the other day, but I knew instantly that it was true.

        "My mother swears I learned to read by watching The Electric Company on TV, so maybe that\u2019s why I was initially a bit lax when it came to my daughter and screen time.

I don\u2019t mean the occasional 3 miles once or twice a week, although even this minimal amount of exercise seems to have positive health benefits.

        "Twice in the history of the beloved televised baking competition known as The Great British Bake Off (aka The Great British Baking Show in the U. S.) a baker used salt instead of sugar, and produced an inedible cake. Unrelated: The BBC just lost Bake Off to independent broadcaster Channel 4, and it\u2019s left a bad taste in everybody\u2019s mouth. It\u2019s a blow to the BBC Love Productions, which makes the show, danced around the issue of money (the Beeb\u2019s offer was apparently 10 million pounds short of Channel 4\u2019s).",
        "The 10th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season was an odd one: When the National Weather Service announced the formation of Tropical Storm Julia in northeastern Florida on Tuesday night, it marked one of the few known instances of such a storm developing over land rather than open water. \u201dThe formation of a tropical storm while the center of circulation is over land is a bit unusual, but not unprecedented,\u201d Dennis Feltgen of the National Weather Service tells NPR. \u201dIt last occurred in 1988 with Beryl over southeastern Louisiana.",
