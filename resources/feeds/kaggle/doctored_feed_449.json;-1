        "The ground had barely stopped shaking from North Korea\u2019s most recent nuclear test last week when the international condemnations began. President Obama called the test destabilizing and provocative. South Korean President Park said the test displayed North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s \u201dmaniacal recklessness.\u201d Even North Korea\u2019s longtime ally China said it \u201dresolutely\u201d opposed the test. Almost as fast came calls for additional sanctions on the North. But North Korea is already one of the most heavily sanctioned countries in the world.",
        "The pitches from pharmacy chains started in August: Come in and get your flu shot. Convenience is touted. So are incentives. CVS offers a 20 shopping pass for everyone who gets a shot, while Walgreens donates toward international vaccination efforts. The start of flu season is still weeks, if not months, away. Yet marketing of the vaccine has become an almost effort that starts when the shots become available in August and is hyped as long as the supply lasts \u2014 often into April or May.",

        "As presidential candidates travel the country, they often deliver the same speech, or close to it. We are annotating speeches delivered by both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to give you a sense of what they are talking about regularly, and how they say it. To think about the structure of a Hillary Clinton stump speech, imagine a book shelf. Clinton probably has 50 books on the shelf, various elements of a speech, anecdotes, policies she talks about, themes, turns of phrase. For each speech she grabs a bunch of different books off the shelf.",
        "Presidential candidates deliver hundreds of stump speeches over the course of their campaigns. This week, we\u2019re looking closely to the messages that the two candidates deliver in city after city. In his stump speech, Donald Trump brings the energy and spends a lot of time talking about core issues like illegal immigration and trade as well as attacking the media and hitting Hillary Clinton, especially over her emails. And there\u2019s plenty of especially about what\u2019s in the news. Here, we take a closer look at how a speech Trump delivered on September 9 in Pensacola, Fla.",
        "David Axelrod, a top Democratic strategist and former senior adviser to President Obama, believes Hillary Clinton made the controversy surrounding her health worse by not disclosing her pneumonia diagnosis earlier. \u201dObviously her penchant for privacy is what led her to have a separate email system, and there have been other occasions in her public career in which she\u2019s tried to create a zone of privacy,\u201d Axelrod told NPR\u2019s Steve Inskeep on Morning Edition.",
        "When Lanarion Norwood Jr. was 9 years old, he opened his family\u2019s refrigerator to find it almost empty. His grandmother, unemployed because of disability, had run out of food for the month. So Norwood did what many young children adamantly resist: He went to bed early. Sleeping, he reasoned, would help him suppress hunger, and he knew the next day he could eat at his Atlanta school. That memory is one of Norwood\u2019s earliest recollections of being hungry, but not his last. As a teenager, his food concerns grew with his appetite.",
        "The floods that hit Louisiana last month were caused by rainfall that was unlike anything seen there in centuries. Most of the southern part of the state was drenched with up to 2 or 3 inches in an hour. A total of 31 inches fell just northeast of Baton Rouge in about three days 20 parishes were declared federal disaster areas. Climate scientists and flood managers suspect there could more like that to come \u2014 in Louisiana and in other parts of the country. There have always been extraordinary rainstorms \u2014 storms stronger than anyone can remember.",
        "From anthrax outbreaks in thawing permafrost to rice farms flooded with salty water, climate change seems to play a bigger and bigger role in global health each year. But sometimes it can be hard to grasp what all the numbers and stats mean. For instance, when scientists say Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has gone up about 1 degree Celsius over the past 150 years or so, what does that really mean? Besides, hasn\u2019t Earth\u2019s temperature always fluctuated?",
        "Edward Albee, the Pulitzer playwright of Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? among many others, died Friday at the age of 88 following a short illness, according to his longtime personal assistant. Albee didn\u2019t particularly like it when people asked him what his plays were \u201dabout.\u201d As he wrote in a 2007 letter to the audience of Me, Myself and I, that question made him \u201dbecome uncooperative \u2014 and occasionally downright hostile.\u201d Albee acknowledged that his plays could be \u201doccasionally complex\u201d but were \u201dinfrequently opaque.\u201d The best way to enjoy them, he advised, was without any baggage.",
        "The city of San Francisco is in a quandary. Like many big cities, it faces an affordability crisis, and city leaders are looking for a way to build housing to help and residents stay there. But one proposal to give current residents of a historically neighborhood help to do that has run afoul of the Obama administration. Consider the case of Mack Watson. At 96, he is a vision of elegance in his freshly pressed ribbon collar shirt, vest and sports coat. He has called San Francisco home since 1947. \u201dNothing is like San Francisco.",
        "If Hari Kondabolu cracks you up, you may actually have his mother to thank \u2014 he says she\u2019s the one who taught him to be funny. Uma Kondabolu was a doctor in India who \u201dleft everything behind,\u201d her son explains. \u201dThat\u2019s difficult, and yet she laughed her way through it.\u201d It was only recently that he began to appreciate that his mom\u2019s life outlook was at the root of his own comedy. His dark sense of humor and his ability to transform negative things into positive? \u201dThat comes from her,\u201d he tells NPR\u2019s David Greene.",
        "There will officially be no candidate on the presidential debate stage. Libertarian Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green Party officially did not make the cut, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced Friday. To qualify for the stage, a candidate needs to be polling at 15 percent or higher in an average of five major national polls and qualify for the ballot in enough states to have a mathematical chance to win the presidency. Johnson had the best chance.",
        "Susan Glisson stands on the campus of the University of Mississippi near a 1906 Confederate memorial that has long been at the center of racial strife here. The statue \u2014 a Confederate soldier atop a gray obelisk \u2014 was a rallying point for a white mob opposing integration in a deadly 1962 riot. Decades later, Glisson recalls, she was a graduate student during dueling protests near the statue over the practice of flying Confederate battle flags at Ole Miss football games.",
        "Donald Trump finally addressed whether he believes the current president was, indeed, born in the United States. \u201dPresident Obama was born in the United States. Period,\u201d he said Friday morning. It\u2019s yet another surreal storyline in the 2016 presidential campaign. Five years ago, Trump became the loudest voice in the \u201dbirther\u201d movement, advancing the false claim that President Obama was born outside the United States. Though his campaign insisted he believes Obama was born in the U. S. in a Thursday night statement, it was only on Friday morning that Trump finally said so himself.",
        "After years of peddling a false conspiracy theory that President Obama wasn\u2019t born in the United States, Donald Trump \u2014 just 53 days before Election Day \u2014 now says he believes the president was born in the U. S. \u201dPresident Obama was born in the United States. Period,\u201d Trump said at a campaign event in a ballroom in his new hotel in Washington. \u201dNow, we want to get back to making America strong and great again.\u201d But Trump did not apologize to President Obama.",

        "Arizona\u2019s attorney general will issue new guidance about the state\u2019s immigration enforcement law, as part of an agreement with a coalition of immigrant rights groups that in return will drop their legal challenges to the controversial Senate Bill 1070 that took effect in 2010. Several key provisions of the law were thrown out back in 2012, when the U. S.

        "What happens when two talented face off against 30 on a soccer field? We now know the answer to that question, thanks to the LA Galaxy\u2019s Robbie Keane and midfielder Steven Gerrard. The match was the finale in the LA Galaxy\u2019s \u201dRidiculous Soccer Challenge\u201d series we also found it to be good fun as we reach the end of a week\u2019s worth of serious news.

        "Lilibeth Diego lives in Malate, in one of Manila\u2019s seemingly endless slums. People are packed so tightly here, they often wash and bathe outside. Diego is 53 and has been a meth fiend, she says, since high school. \u201dEvery day since 1981,\u201d she says. And she\u2019s got the face and lack of teeth to prove it. She swears she never dealt drugs. A few weeks ago, though, after recently elected President Rodrigo Duterte launched his war on drugs, she surrendered, along with her husband. She says it was an easy choice. \u201dI\u2019m scared to die,\u201d she says.",
        "Deepa Malik was about to make history. Seated in a chair on a hot day in Rio, Malik \u2014 paralyzed from the chest down \u2014 held a 6. shot put between her neck and right shoulder. She took a deep breath and hurled the shot 15 feet across the throwing circle. The throw got Malik a silver at the Paralympic Games in Brazil this past Monday \u2014 and made her the first Indian woman to win a Paralympics medal. \u201dMy first thoughts were, \u2019Oh my God, have I really won?\u2019 \u201d says Malik, 45, via email.",
        "On one of those late summer New York City evenings when a thunderstorm left a double rainbow hanging over Manhattan, the downtown club City Winery provided the perfect setting for a lucky crowd of a few hundred to experience a performance by The Head and the Heart. The new album, Signs Of Light, signals some change for this adored band. A new label, some rest between tours and a key member\u2019s hiatus brought new energies to bear on this third album.",
        "Flash drive. Laptop. Phone. If your home was under attack and you had to flee, what would you take with you? That\u2019s the theme of a new celebrity video highlighting the global refugee crisis. Released last week on Facebook by the U. N. Refugee Agency, it features 10 actors, including Cate Blanchett, Keira Knightley, Stanley Tucci, Jesse Eisenberg and Chiwetel Ejiofor. And heartthrob Kit Harington from Game of Thrones.

        "Issues of digital privacy are rarely this amoosing. In August 2015, Google Street View captured images along the banks of the River Cam, in Cambridge, England. As the cameras snapped their way through a meadow called Coe Fen, a cow crossed the road. Google apparently decided it would behoove it to add an blur. That is to say \u2014 the cow beside the Cam in Coe Fen was caught on camera, incognito. When an editor at The Guardian found the blurred face this week, he took a screenshot and shared it on Twitter, much to the Internet\u2019s delight.",
        "In terms of sheer intensity, Saul Williams\u2019 Tiny Desk concert may be the most potent in our history. Only Kate Tempest comes to mind as its equal, which makes sense given that both mix music with bracing, truthful poetry.",

        "The arrest warrant issued six years ago for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been upheld once again. On Friday, a Swedish appeals court dismissed Assange\u2019s latest challenge to the detention order against him. The arrest warrant is related to allegations of sexual assault from 2010. Assange, who has avoided extradition to Sweden by living at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, has said for years that he fears being sent to Sweden would put him at risk of then being extradited to the U. S. If sent to the U. S.",
        "In school, they called her stupid. Dumb. Lazy. Eileen Kushner had always had trouble with reading and simple math, and while she was growing up in Detroit during the 1950s, her fellow students didn\u2019t make life easy on her. Later, she\u2019d be diagnosed with a learning disability, but at the time, she just had to suffer the slings and arrows of her peers. When she got married right out of high school and had three kids, she hoped that her life as a mom might hide her learning problems. Things didn\u2019t work out that way.",
        "Privately insured people with cancer were diagnosed earlier and lived longer than those who were uninsured or were covered by Medicaid, according to two recent studies. In one study, researchers examined data from more than 13, 600 adult patients who had glioblastoma multiforme, the most common type of malignant brain tumor, between 2007 and 2012. The other study analyzed data from more than 10, 200 adults who were diagnosed with testicular cancer between 2007 and 2011."
