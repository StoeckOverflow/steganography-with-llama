        "A week after his running mate, Hillary Clinton, came under attack for describing half of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters as in the \u201dbasket of deplorables,\u201d Tim Kaine said he, too, believes there are ideals \u201dnot in accord with American values\u201d motivating some of the GOP nominee\u2019s backers. \u201dThere are some who are motivated by dark emotions, that are not in accord with American values,\u201d the Democratic vice presidential nominee told NPR\u2019s Steve Inskeep during an interview Thursday in New Hampshire.",
        "Democratic vice presidential nominee, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, spoke with NPR\u2019s Steve Inskeep. Steve Inskeep: I ran across an interview that you did in 2008, in which you said to Charlie Rose that, you said in this interview, that you believe that voters primarily decide on the character of a candidate. Sen. Tim Kaine: I do. Yeah, I do. Is that still true in 2016? I think so. Yeah, I think it is. The issues are really important, but usually they need to connect to a broader view that a voter has about a candidate.",
        "After the disaster that was 2004\u2019s Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, Bridget\u2019s hot mess of a life lands safely back in the spry hands of Sharon Maguire. Maguire, reportedly the model for Bridget\u2019s fizzy friend Shazzer, directs this new sequel with the same antic flair she brought to Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary when the franchise began in 2001. That film earned many detractors on many grounds, and Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby will too. I love both movies for the generous, candid, willfully vulgar spirit with which they take on the often inhospitable world many women face today.",
        "Summarizing its investigation of Edward Snowden, the House Intelligence Committee says the former National Security Agency contractor did tremendous damage to the U. S. The committee published the summary findings of a investigation Thursday as a new film about Snowden opens across the country. Snowden stole 1. 5 million classified government documents that he had access to as an NSA contractor. He then fled to Russia via Hong Kong. As NPR\u2019s David Welna reports: \u201dMost major congressional reports are rolled out with news conferences, floor speeches and press releases. Not this one.",
        "Mules named Sal are hard to find these days along the Erie Canal. But almost two centuries after workers began digging its route across upstate New York, you can still see barges pushed and pulled through what some consider the first superhighway of the U. S. As the canal prepares to celebrate its bicentennial next July, some are questioning whether the canal is still worth subsidizing. After the original canal was completed in 1825, the waterway was a technological marvel.",
        "It was in 1909 that Nobel German physician Paul Ehrlich proposed the idea that our bodies are fighting constant battles with cancer and that, thankfully, most of the time we win. Ehrlich was a visionary in recognizing the interaction between cancer and the immune system. Specifically, that cancerous cells are continuously arising in the body but that our immune defenses in many if not most cases keep them at bay.",
        "The U. S. Department of Defense is gathering information on an airstrike in eastern Syria that was halted amid fears that the airstrike hit Syrian soldiers in the region on Saturday. The attack, which had been targeting Islamic State militants, hit Syrian soldiers instead, according to the Russian military. \u201dThe coalition airstrike was halted immediately when coalition officials were informed by Russian officials that it was possible the personnel and vehicles targeted were part of the Syrian military,\u201d U. S. Central Command announced in a statement. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen.",
        "Donald Glover\u2019s new TV show Atlanta has been described as having \u201ddreamy and weird\u201d moments, of mixing \u201d . .. with brief moments of surrealism . .. all which serve to disorient.\u201d The show has laughs that are \u201dprickly and strange, laced with menace and sadness, if also a real sense of place.\u201d Glover, who created, stars in and sometimes writes and directs the show, says creating that odd feeling was important. \u201dIt had to make people feel a certain way,\u201d Glover tells NPR\u2019s Michel Martin.",
        "On a bright spring afternoon this May, Tom Charles drove to Newark International Airport to pick up a family of Syrian refugees. Charles is an attorney and a bank consultant, devoted to data and details, but he had scant information on the family that would become part of his life for the next year. He was also sure the Syrian family knew nothing about his team from Nassau Presbyterian Church, who would drive them from the airport to a donated house in Princeton, N. J. \u201dThey know nothing about us.",
        "Donald Trump hit Hillary Clinton on Second Amendment rights during a Miami rally Friday night, but made a controversial statement while doing so \u2014 suggesting her Secret Service detail should stop carrying guns and \u201dsee what happens to her.\u201d \u201dNow, you know she\u2019s very much against the Second Amendment, she wants to destroy your Second Amendment \u2014 guns, guns, guns, right? I think what we should do is, she goes around with armed bodyguards like you have never seen before,\u201d the GOP nominee said, deviating from his prepared remarks on the teleprompter.",
        "Russian officials are working to make sure that Sunday\u2019s parliamentary elections aren\u2019t a replay of the last such vote, in 2011. That election triggered protests in which tens of thousands of Russians cried out against allegations of widespread and fraud. It was the biggest challenge to President Vladimir Putin, who has now been either president or prime minister for the past 17 years. Analysts are predicting that this balloting will result in a lower house of parliament that\u2019s just as willing as the current one to Kremlin directives, but with less need for the authorities to manipulate the vote.",
        "Richard Shindell has been making records for almost 25 years and has risen to the top of the world. For this year\u2019s Careless, Shindell is back with a new collection of original songs \u2014 a project that stretched out over three years, between his work on The Pine Hill Project with Lucy Kaplansky and his life in Buenos Aires (where he lives with his family). Shindell calls his new songs \u201dambitious and lush,\u201d and they stretch his sound toward electric blues.",
        "The relationship between the U. S. and China these days is fraught with political tensions. But both countries are committed to sending more of their young people to study language and culture in each other\u2019s countries \u2014 and a component of that is sending more U. S. minority students to China. That\u2019s both to provide more students of color with the opportunity to study overseas, and to create a student body abroad that is more representative of U. S. diversity. According to China\u2019s education ministry, 21, 975 American students studied in China in 2015.",
        "Chekhov is supposed to have said that if you show a loaded gun on stage, it has to go off. Ann Patchett\u2019s new novel, Commonwealth, is full of guns that don\u2019t fire. Commonwealth is an unassuming book about the life of a family. But it prompts the kind of evaluations that books about the great and unfamiliar don\u2019t. It is the kind of book that makes you think not of great adventures or faraway places but your own modest choices, and crooked shots at forming a life that suits you. How to make a life?",
        "Ian grew up in Milwaukee, in an family with five kids where the annual income was just $25, 000. He was involved in sports and activities, and spent a year working after high school to save up for college.",
        "Can a country have a split personality? When it comes to Colombia, there\u2019s the nation of gorgeous cities: Think gleaming skyscrapers, landscaped parks and smooth bike lanes all set against stunning mountains. Then there\u2019s the other Colombia, a vast stretch of rural territory that\u2019s desperately poor and at best, effectively lawless. At worst, many of these areas are still dominated by some combination of guerrilla forces, paramilitary groups and gangs that have flourished over years of civil war.",
        "Firecrackers go off, and I hop behind what suddenly looks like a pretty flimsy metal railing, on a bridge over the scenic River Duero, as a more than bull bolts past, chased by villagers. This spectacle, the Toro de la Vega festival in Tordesillas, a drive north of Madrid, has been repeated almost every year, on the second Tuesday of September, since medieval times. Locals chase the bull into a field on the edge of town, where others, on horseback, wield spears. For centuries, the bull would then have been stabbed to death, slowly.",
        "As summertime draws to a close, we look around Alt. Latino World Headquarters and find baskets \u2014 not of deplorables, but of all the CDs that have been gathering around us while we\u2019ve been out on our summer travels. (Yes, we do still get CDs.) So its time to share some of the new music with you.",
        "Two very different narratives on the former National Security Agency contractor unfolded this week. Both proved that the debate over whether Edward Snowden is a traitor or a patriot is in no danger of running out of steam. First, on Thursday, the House Intelligence Committee wrapped up a investigation of Snowden. An unclassified summary of the report pronounces him a \u201da serial exaggerator and fabricator\u201d who \u201dcaused tremendous damage to national security.\u201d The week\u2019s other narrative comes from Hollywood director Oliver Stone. The new movie Snowden opened nationwide this weekend and paints him as a hero.",
        "There has already been a   documentary about Edward Snowden. Now comes a drama from a filmmaker known for dramatizing the Vietnam war and the Kennedy assassination.",
        "A day after an explosion in Manhattan injured 29 people, New York authorities said all injured people have all been released from hospitals. They say they do not have evidence the blast is linked to international terrorism. The damage to the site at West 23rd Street in New York City\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood is extensive, Gov. Andrew Cuomo told reporters on Saturday morning. \u201dThe force of the explosion, you can see it down the block, across the street. There\u2019s glass everywhere.",
        "An explosion in Manhattan has injured at least 29 people, according to officials in New York City. The police and fire departments both report that none of the injuries appear . Mayor Bill de Blasio says initial investigations suggest the explosion, on West 23rd Street in Chelsea, was an \u201dintentional act,\u201d but that there is \u201dno evidence at this point\u201d of a connection to terrorism. Police are also investigating \u201da second potential device\u201d several blocks away, on West 27th Street, de Blasio says.",
        "I was in New York for the weekend, visiting a friend who lives on West 27th Street. We\u2019d been in at an event in Brooklyn in the cab home, the radio had been saying something about an explosion in Chelsea, on 23rd Street between Sixth and Seventh \u2014 four blocks from her home. The part of my brain that always wants to believe nothing\u2019s wrong said, \u201dOh, it\u2019s a gas leak. A transformer explosion. It\u2019ll mess up the traffic but we\u2019ll be home in an hour.\u201d I think everyone has that voice in their head, to some extent.",
        "It was the night of the giants. And none stood taller at the 2016 Emmys than the HBO juggernauts Game of Thrones and Veep, which won for best drama and comedy series, respectively. The People v. O. J. Simpson also won the Emmy for outstanding limited series. Game of Thrones and VEEP may have pulled off repeat wins at Sunday\u2019s Emmy Awards, but there was also plenty of room for fresh faces in the winner\u2019s circle. nominee Rami Malek won best drama actor for his role as on USA\u2019s Mr. Robot as delusional hacker Elliot Alderson.",
        "You want to win the Emmy pool tonight. Doesn\u2019t matter why: Maybe you want the money, maybe you just want to rub your victory in your friend Trish\u2019s face, because she reads Variety and calls TV shows \u201dskeins.\u201d God, Trish, right? Trish is the worst. Whatever the reason, you can taste victory. And if you base all of your Emmy picks on our rigorous analyses below, you\u2019ll do more than taste it \u2014 you\u2019ll eat it.",
        "An assailant at a mall in St. Cloud, Minn. stabbed at least nine people before the suspect was shot dead by an police officer, authorities said. Police say he was \u201dreportedly wearing a private security uniform\u201d and began attacking shoppers at Crossroads Center just after 8 p. m. as Minnesota Public Radio\u2019s Tim Nelson told our Newscast unit. \u201dPolice said that the attacks occurred in several places in the mall,\u201d he added. \u201dSt. Cloud Police Chief Blair Anderson said that suspect made at least one reference to Allah and asked one person if they were Muslim,\u201d as Nelson reported.",
        "For some comics fans, Alan Moore is basically a god. He\u2019s the and magnificently bearded writer of comics like Watchmen, V for Vendetta and From Hell \u2014 though if you\u2019ve only ever seen the movies, please, I implore you: Read the books. Recently, Moore said he\u2019s stepping back from comics to focus on other projects \u2014 like his epic new novel, Jerusalem. It\u2019s full of angels, devils, saints and sinners and visionaries, ghost children and wandering writers, all circling his home town of Northampton, England. Moore still lives in Northampton, about an hour north of London.",
        "This is it, the Big Book to end all Big Books. The one you may have heard of \u2014 Jesusalem \u2014 written by that guy who also writes the comics or whatever? (Alan Moore, the groundbreaking, hairy genius behind V For Vendetta and Watchmen.) The one that took him a decade to peck out, clocks in at something like 1300 pages, and weighs as much as a small, dense cat?",
        "Americans who endured the brutal recession and slow recovery now are seeing an economic sunrise: Wages are up, jobs are growing and more families are lifting themselves up out of poverty. And yet, dark clouds are still hanging over millions of Americans. No set of sunny statistics can help an unemployed coal miner in Kentucky pay the mortgage. Upbeat wage data won\u2019t reassure a Michigan factory worker who is nervously watching robots replace his ."
