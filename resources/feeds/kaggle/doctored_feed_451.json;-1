        "It\u2019s a headline you can write every election year: FLORIDA THE BIG BATTLEGROUND IN THIS YEARS\u2019 RACE TO THE WHITE HOUSE, But that banner belies significant changes taking place in rapid fashion. In fact, if your image of Florida politics is senior citizens peppering candidates with questions about Social Security and Medicare, it\u2019s time for an update. Or a new headline. Perhaps something like this: MILLENNIALS A RISING FORCE IN FLORIDA ELECTIONS, Senior citizens \u2014 now mostly Baby Boomers \u2014 are still a large section of voters in the state.",
        "Election year or not, nothing says fall like football and basketball \u2014 and while politics may dominate the public consciousness, there are a lot of people flipping the channel to sports for a respite from that kind of action. As a Miami Dolphins fan, I\u2019m preparing myself for more of the same: Exhilarating leads that go swiftly to hell in the closing moments of the fourth quarter. And as far as my Miami Heat are concerned, I\u2019ll be surprised if we even make the playoffs in 2017.",

Stanley Forman took the picture on April 5, 1976, for what was then the Boston Herald American. \u201dFor the time (it) has everything you want in the picture,\u201d says Forman.

        "To be blunt, I couldn\u2019t care less about most of the hotels I\u2019ve stayed in over the years as a foreign correspondent. Many of them were just a place to take a shower, sleep and then forget about. But the Villa Creole in Haiti was different. I first stayed there in 2008 and quickly found it to be an oasis. When I was planning a trip to Haiti last month I went onto the Villa Creole\u2019s website to look for its phone number and discovered it had closed down. My stomach dropped.",
        "Much like armies, train travelers in India march on their stomachs. And this was certainly true when I was a child, growing up in the 1980s, in the southern city of Chennai.

        "In September of last year, Donald Trump released his first tax plan, but now he has made another go of it.
