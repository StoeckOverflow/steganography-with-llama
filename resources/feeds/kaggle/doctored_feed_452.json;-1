        "Don Buchla believed in the future as much he was concerned in what it should and could hold and what the role for himself would play, not simply within but outside his chosen community in California, and not as some passport but something which might make it so that what is to happen, happens as a part. obviously a great deal more, he had to say on his role, as it was, in the future than simply to talk of himself and his own part in this process and that, which in fact has little to add, except that of some",
        "When our collective attention turns to the flood of new shows headed to network television each fall, the same question arises: Does the fall TV season even matter anymore? It\u2019s true that in the age of #PeakTV new shows drop all the time, so focusing on the fall seems a little old fashioned. But I think this time of year still matters, for a few reasons.",
        "The head wrap was brilliant blue. It mirrored the applique on the long yellow bodice of the strapless gown and was echoed in the shoes and handbag. Lupita Nyong\u2019o wore the outfit this past week at the Toronto premiere of her film Queen of Katwe. Fashion critics called it \u201dflawless.\u201d The designer of the dress is fashion queen Carolina Herrera, born in Venezuela and now living in America. But the head tie is pure Nigerian. That got Nigerians buzzing. And they weren\u2019t necessarily buzzing in admiration.",
        "Authorities have filed federal charges against Ahmad Khan Rahami, the sole suspect in the weekend bombings in Manhattan and New Jersey. The charges include use of a weapon of mass destruction, bombing a public place and destruction of property. Rahami previously had been charged in New Jersey in connection with the shootout that led to his arrest Monday. The criminal complaint, filed in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, details why investigators are convinced that Rahami is behind Saturday\u2019s bombings.",
        "\u201dIf the system was fair, would I be OK with prison? I\u2019m saying that if the system was fair, there would be no prison.\u201d \u2014 Morehouse College professor Marc Lamont Hill, When Marc Lamont Hill, a professor and activist who wants to abolish prisons, said that to me recently, I understood where he was coming from. Intellectually, at least. America\u2019s criminal justice system, with its machinelike orientation to conviction and incarceration, has grown so many tentacles that it tends to touch the lives of the people in communities of color who are not themselves up to anything shady.",
        "Facing off with the CEO whose massive bank appropriated customers\u2019 information to create millions of bogus accounts, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, . had sharp questions Tuesday for Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf. She said Stumpf made millions of dollars in the \u201dscam,\u201d telling him, \u201dYou should resign . .. and you should be criminally investigated.\u201d As we\u2019ve reported before, Wells Fargo is paying $185 million in penalties for acts that date to at least to 2011.",
        "Wells Fargo has been feeling the heat since news broke earlier this month that it was being fined $185 million to settle allegations that thousands of employees secretly opened unauthorized accounts for customers in order to meet sales goals. During testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, Wells Fargo Chairman and CEO John Stumpf apologized for betraying customers\u2019 trust.",
        "Isha Devi hails from Agra, home of the Taj Mahal, built by a grieving king for a beloved queen. Isha now lives three hours and a world away from any such romantic ideals. Renting a small dingy room, this mother of a and has come to the outskirts of New Delhi to live close to her fertility clinic. Isha, 30, is six months pregnant with someone else\u2019s twins. Her room opens onto a noisy alleyway of families in similarly cramped quarters all sharing a single bathroom. Isha groans, shifts uncomfortably on her cot and rearranges her pink floral sari.",
        "Sometimes the world can feel a bit uniform: the same department stores in every shopping mall, the same fast food chains on every corner. The website Atlas Obscura will make you reconsider that sense of monotony. \u201dThe world is still this huge, bizarre, vast place filled with astounding stuff,\u201d says Dylan Thuras.",
        "More than 850 people were accidentally granted U. S. citizenship despite being from countries with a history of immigration fraud or that raised national security concerns. All 858 people had been previously ordered removed from the country. The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Inspector General says bad fingerprint records are to blame. NPR\u2019s Brian Naylor reports: \u201dThe inspector general\u2019s report says neither the Department of Homeland Security nor the FBI has all the old fingerprint records of people who have been ordered deported . .. because many of those records are on paper and haven\u2019t yet been digitized.",
        "It\u2019s a puzzling image \u2014 with a crime story behind it. Women in colorful saris \u2014 hot pink, highlighter yellow, teal and royal blue \u2014 snake up a dusty gray quarry, carrying baskets of coal over their heads. It\u2019s early in the morning they\u2019re stealing from the mine before officials come in for the day. It\u2019s certainly not your typical Instagram photo \u2014 selfies, #TBTs or food porn. But it won Ronny Sen, a photographer from India, one of the top spots in Getty Images second annual Instagram Grant.",
        "The U. S. government wants to help you take your hands off the wheel. The Department of Transportation on Tuesday issued its Federal Automated Vehicle Policy, which outlines how manufacturers and developers can ensure safe design of driverless vehicles, tells states what responsibilities they will have and points out potential new tools for ensuring safety. Regulators say they want to prepare for the transition to vehicles, which they say will save money, time and lives.",
        "Saudi Arabia is such an influential player in the oil industry that any action it takes \u2014 or is rumored to take \u2014 can sway global markets. So it\u2019s not surprising there\u2019s a lot of speculation about whether its massive state oil company, Saudi Aramco, is trying to buy a refinery in Texas. The oil refinery, owned by the Dutch company LyondellBasell, sits along the Gulf of Mexico coast near the port of Houston. It\u2019s for sale, and analysts believe Saudi Arabia is eyeing it.",
        "About one in five children in the United States shows signs of a mental health disorder \u2014 anything from ADHD to eating disorders to suicide. And yet, as we\u2019ve been reporting this month, many schools aren\u2019t prepared to work with these students. Often, there\u2019s been too little training in recognizing the problems, the staff who are trained are overworked, and there just isn\u2019t enough money. When there are enough people to handle the job, how should all the different roles fit together? Many experts point to one model.",
        "Riad Sattouf\u2019s memoir of his childhood in the Middle East stirred up a complicated swirl of emotions when the first volume was released in the U. S. last year. Many reviewers seemed fascinated by something beyond Sattouf\u2019s perspicacity and artistry. There was a kind of awe at his rash trampling of forbidden zones. His darkly ironic recollections of growing up in Syria and Libya came with no mitigating calls for understanding (of the customs that prevailed in those countries\u2019 hinterlands) or forgiveness (for his narcissistic father).",
        "Additional reporting by LA Johnson. I\u2019ve attended the Small Press Expo, or SPX, for 10 years now. This year, I convinced NPR to let me take a reporting kit and interview attendees about what drew them to the show. (You can check out more photos, illustrations and interviews with creators from the 2016 Small Press Expo on the NPR Illustrations Tumblr over the coming days and weeks.) In theory, SPX seems a lot like many of the other that have been popping up across the country over the last few years.",
        "Many people struggling with opioid addiction can\u2019t find a doctor to provide treatment, even though it\u2019s highly effective. One reason could be that doctors who are qualified to prescribe the medication typically treat just a handful of patients. Researchers at the RAND Corporation looked at pharmacy records from the seven states with the most doctors approved to prescribe buprenorphine, which helps people manage cravings and avoid withdrawal. They found 3, 234 doctors who had prescribed the drug, also known as Suboxone, to new patients from 2010 to 2013.",
        "President Obama addressed the United Nations General Assembly this morning, his final speech before the international governing body. As he nears the end of his two terms in office, the president spoke about some of his administration\u2019s biggest foreign policy initiatives, including the importance of the Paris climate accord, the nuclear deal with Iran and fighting the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. He also talked about the ongoing, multisided war in Syria.",
        "For nearly eight years, President Obama has been putting his stamp on U. S. foreign policy both by what he\u2019s done and by what he chosen not to do. His legacy includes achievements like the international climate agreement. It also includes festering problems like the Syrian civil war. Obama is summing up that legacy himself Tuesday, as he addresses the United Nations General Assembly for what\u2019s likely to be the last time as president.",
        "Fitness trackers remain wildly popular, but do they make us fit? Maybe not, according to a study that asked overweight or obese young adults to use the tiny tracking tools to lose weight. The 470 people in the study were put on a diet and asked to exercise more. They all started losing weight. Six months in, half the group members started their diet and exercise. The other half were given fitness trackers to monitor their activity. After two years, both groups were equally active. But the people with the fitness trackers lost less weight. Wait. What?",
        "Neil Young\u2019s latest single is a jangly, shuffling song that takes on the Dakota Access Pipeline, a vast oil duct under construction near Native American land in North Dakota. The track, called \u201dIndian Givers,\u201d supports the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, which is attempting to block the pipeline\u2019s construction, and targets the government and oil companies. \u201dBehind big money,\u201d Young sings, \u201djustice always fails.\u201d A video for the song shows Young driving in his car and singing, intercut with footage of Native Americans protesting the pipeline. One of them is Dale \u201dHappy\u201d American Horse Jr.",
        "Eaters and cooks know that flavor, in the jargon of neuroscientists, is . Taste is all important, to be sure. But so is the look of food and its feel in the mouth \u2014 not to mention its odor and the noisy crunch, or juicy squelch, that it may or may not make as we bite into it. The perception of flavor demands that we exercise a suite of not only gustatory, but also visual, olfactory, tactile and auditory sensitivities.",
        "In an effort to turn away from chemical pesticides, which have the potential to damage the environment, some farmers are looking in a new direction in the struggle against pests. They\u2019re warding off intruding insects and noxious weeds with bugs and chickens. Gary Wenig and his wife bought 40 acres in central Missouri to grow organic vegetables. The land was full of weeds and insects, he says, and going organic meant the Wenigs couldn\u2019t use conventional pesticides like the ubiquitous Roundup or atrazine. Organic farmers can use certain nonsynthetic pesticides, but they\u2019re expensive and still can be toxic.",
        "Malaria, mosquitoes and chicken. That\u2019s what Rickard Ignell had on his mind when he conducted his studies in Ethiopia. Malaria is a major health issue in Ethiopia, with about 5 million cases and 70, 000 deaths a year. Humans and animals share living space in western Ethiopia, where Ignell, a professor at the Swedish University of Agricultural Science, was planning to do his research. But little was known about how mosquitoes interact with various animals. Do certain animals attract the insects? Do other animals repel them?",
        "Social media have become home to two things in recent years: memes and public shaming. Both came into play Monday night when Donald Trump Jr. tweeted an image of a bowl of Skittles, comparing Syrian refugees to poisoned candy. \u201dIf I had a bowl of Skittles and I told you three would kill you, would you take a handful?\u201d the meme asks. \u201dThat\u2019s our Syrian refugee problem.\u201d The post by the Republican presidential candidate\u2019s son immediately went viral.",
        "With the news that one of the Paris attackers may have entered Europe posing as a refugee from Syria, more than half of American governors are now objecting to Syrian refugees being resettled in their states. On Tuesday, White House officials hosted a call with 34 governors to better explain current security screening measures. And this week, some members of Congress have called on the Obama administration to stop or at least pause the resettlement program until refugees can be properly vetted. Here are four things you should know about the current vetting process and concerns over security: 1.",
        "When in North Carolina, never pass up barbecue and cherry cobbler. That was Donald Trump\u2019s approach between campaign rallies in the battleground state on Tuesday. The Republican nominee stopped for lunch and a few handshakes at Stamey\u2019s Barbecue in Greensboro. Retail stops like this are common in politics \u2014 especially during the primary season \u2014 and they\u2019re often a chance for both voters and reporters to ask questions. But at this stage of the campaign, they feel more choreographed \u2014 requiring careful planning and a team of Secret Service agents scouring the place beforehand.",
        "Light streams in through the bay window of Mike Nelson\u2019s home in London\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood as he pitches it like a polished salesman. \u201dIt\u2019s a fantastic, house\u201d says Nelson of his row home, which sits on a quiet street, lined with Japanese cherry trees in a section of town between Kensington Palace and the Thames. \u201dIt\u2019s got 3, 100 square feet.

        "A month ago, there were \u201dRoad Closed\u201d signs up on all of Donald Trump\u2019s potential paths to the White House. But now, less than a week before the crucial first debate of this presidential race \u2014 and as a terrorism bombing investigation continues in New York and New Jersey \u2014 a viable route has emerged for the Republican nominee, according to the latest NPR Battleground Map. About a dozen battleground states have gotten closer, with some key ones showing Trump leading for the first time.",
        "A rare genetic disorder is helping scientists understand our mysterious ability to sense where we are in space, known as proprioception. This \u201dsixth sense\u201d is what dancers and gymnasts rely on to tell them the exact position of their body and limbs at every moment. It also tells them how much force each muscle is exerting. \u201dThe most beautiful demonstration of proprioception in action is Simone Biles when she is spinning and somersaulting through the air,\u201d says Carsten Bonnemann, a pediatrician and geneticist at the National institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke."
