        "Attempting to court black voters over the last two months, Donald Trump has painted a pretty dire picture of their lives. \u201dYou\u2019re living in poverty,\u201d he said in late August. \u201dYour schools are no good. You have no jobs. percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?\u201d On Tuesday Trump took this rhetoric one step further, telling a North Carolina audience that \u201dour communities are absolutely in the worst shape they\u2019ve ever been in before.",
        "The biggest reason supporters of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton support their candidate is because they\u2019re not the other. That\u2019s the finding from a Pew Research Center study of a month\u2019s worth of survey data. Pew found, from more than 4, 000 interviews conducted online and by mail, that the \u201dmain reason\u201d supporters of both candidates were voting for their candidate was because \u201dhe is not Clinton,\u201d and \u201dshe is not Trump.\u201d Almost 1 out of every 3 people said so. He\u2019s \u201dNot a LIAR,\u201d wrote one male Trump supporter.",
        "When\u2019s the last time you ordered turtle when you went out to eat? Most of us would probably turn it down in an instant if we saw it on a menu. But terrapin was a completely normal entree for diners at the finest restaurants of a century ago. America\u2019s changing tastes \u2014 and what they have to say about our culture \u2014 are explored in a new nonfiction book, Ten Restaurants That Changed America. It begins with Delmonico\u2019s, a grand Gotham destination since 1837, with clubby red leather chairs, black and white tile floors and mahogany panels.",
        "A black man who runs from police shouldn\u2019t necessarily be considered suspicious \u2014 and merely might be trying to avoid \u201dthe recurring indignity of being racially profiled,\u201d the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court says. The court made that observation as it overturned the conviction of a man who was charged with carrying a firearm without a permit after he ran from a Boston police officer who, the court says in its ruling, \u201dlacked reasonable suspicion\u201d to try to stop him in the first place.",
        "The holidays on the horizon promise golden opportunities to shamelessly stuff your face. But munch carefully: All that grub comes at a cost. Researchers averaged the daily weights of 3, 000 people in Germany, Japan and the U. S. for a year and saw a spike in weight gain following every major holiday. In the United States and Germany, people weighed the most at the beginning of January, following Christmas and the New Year.",
        "Trigger warnings, the that college professors give to students to let them know disturbing content is coming, have gotten a lot of attention as the school year has unfolded. When a University of Chicago dean wrote a letter to incoming freshmen this fall rejecting the idea of those warnings, it sparked a nationwide debate on the use of advisories in the classroom. Our colleagues at NPR Ed recently reported on their survey of more than 800 faculty members at universities around the country, asking about their use of trigger warnings.",

The news came after months of speculation that China had lost control of the or \u201dHeavenly \u201d the space lab that was launched in 2011 with great fanfare. In June, a satellite tracker named Thomas Dorman told Space. com that his observations suggested is in a \u201dslow roll,\u201d with solar panels in an incorrect orientation, and is on track for an uncontrolled fall out of orbit.",
        "It\u2019s no secret that voter registration lists are filled with inaccuracies. People move. Or change their names. Or die. But it can take months if not years for the rolls to get updated. Now, conservative groups are taking a number of election officials to court, saying they\u2019re not doing their jobs. Liberal groups think the real purpose is to make it more difficult for some people to vote. The lawsuits have targeted about a dozen counties so far in Texas, Florida, North Carolina and Mississippi. And even some cities, such as Philadelphia and Alexandria, Va.",
        "Researchers seeking to predict how Americans will vote have for years identified an important clue: The more religious you are, the more likely you are to lean Republican. Conversations with more than \u201dfaith\u201d voters in Boone, N. C. suggest that pattern is holding this year, even while revealing the same high level of voter disenchantment evident across the country. \u201dI\u2019ve always felt that the Republicans align with my beliefs,\u201d said Judith Martinez, 51, a naturalized U. S. citizen born in Mexico.",
        "These two guys may have accidentally disabled a pressure cooker bomb that was left on a sidewalk in Manhattan: The FBI field office in New York just released that still from surveillance video because they want to talk to the men. According to Jim Waters, the New York Police Department\u2019s counterterrorism bureau chief, the men picked up a piece of luggage that was left on the streets of New York this past weekend. They took out a pressure cooker bomb that was inside, but took off with the luggage.",
        "For director Antoine Fuqua, remaking the 1960 film The Magnificent Seven was a return to childhood. He tells Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross that the original film reminds him of his grandmother, who used to watch Westerns with him on Sunday afternoons when he was growing up. \u201dI would sit there with her, and she would make me whatever food I want,\u201d Fuqua says. \u201dWhat I recall about [The Magnificent Seven] was . ..",
        "45 CFR Chapter XIII RIN . That\u2019s the official name of the government standards for running a Head Start program. If the name doesn\u2019t grab you, this should: The Department of Health and Human Services says it\u2019s the first \u201dcomprehensive\u201d revision of Head Start rules since they first published them in 1975. And the changes are, in a word, big. Or two words: \u201dincredibly impressive.\u201d That\u2019s according to NYU\u2019s Pamela Morris, who\u2019s been lead researcher on a number of independent studies of Head Start. Why? Several reasons. One big one: longer hours.",
        "The drug company that makes the EpiPen says it isn\u2019t nearly as profitable as many people assume it is. At least that\u2019s the message Mylan NV CEO Heather Bresch will try to deliver to members of Congress today. Bresch, who is scheduled to testify before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, is expected to tell lawmakers that the company earns $100 profit on each of EpiPen even though they carry a $600 price tag.",
        "The police shooting of a man in Charlotte, N. C. sparked overnight protests and unrest. Protesters threw rocks at police, injuring 16 officers, while police wearing riot gear fired tear gas into the crowds. At one point, a major interstate was shut down as protesters set a fire and vandalized police cars. The protests began Tuesday night after police shot and killed Keith Lamont Scott at an apartment complex near the University of North Carolina, Charlotte.",
        "When Donald Trump Jr. compared Syrian refugees to poisoned Skittles, the condemnation was swift \u2014 critics called the tweet glib, dehumanizing, inaccurate, cruel. Turns out they could have called it something else: copyright infringement. The photo featured in the tweet was taken, without permission or credit, from a man named David Kittos. And Kittos tells the BBC he was once a refugee himself. The photo in question \u2014 a striking shot of a white bowl of Skittles against a white background \u2014 was posted on Flickr more than six years ago.",
        "Most animals die once they can no longer have kids, but men and women tend to totally buck this trend, living decades beyond their reproductive years despite drastic changes in their bodies. A book out in September, How Men Age: What Evolution Reveals About Male Health And Mortality, explores the toll that children take on their parents\u2019 bodies, how love handles and paunches can turn \u201devolutionary lemons into lemonade,\u201d and how men may be responsible for humans\u2019 relatively long lives. Here\u2019s our conversation with author Richard Gutierrez Bribiescas, a biological anthropologist at Yale University, edited for length and clarity.",
        "A mysterious glowing \u201dblob\u201d in outer space has puzzled astronomers for more than 15 years. Now, a team of researchers says it has uncovered the secret behind the blob\u2019s eerie light. The blob was first spotted back in the late 1990s by Chuck Steidel, an astronomer at Caltech, and some colleagues. They were observing a bunch of galaxies in the distant reaches of the universe, he recalls, \u201dbut we also saw these big blotchy things.\u201d At first, they thought they had somehow accidentally screwed up the images.",
        "Before addressing the U. N. General Assembly on Tuesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May told NPR\u2019s Steve Inskeep that she is committed to seeing through Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union. She envisions a future in which her country maintains \u201da strong relationship with Europe\u201d and is a global free trade leader. \u201dI\u2019m very clear that we\u2019re going to make a success of coming out of the European Union,\u201d May said. \u201dThat does mean that we will be out there taking the opportunities now for free trade with a number of countries around the globe.

        "Denmark currently holds the title of world\u2019s happiest country. But we could imagine at least one Norseman back in time who, after a failed cooking attempt, probably felt little of the famed Danish hygge. In a hilly wetland north of Silkeborg, archaeologists have unearthed a wholly intact Bronze Age clay pot containing a cheesy and charred residue burned to its inside. \u201dIt\u2019s a glassy, foamy substance, a lot like when you\u2019ve had a fire and the ashes have been burning so hot that they sometimes cinder together, forming a crumpy texture,\u201d says Kaj F.",
        "Betty Shelby, the Tulsa Police Department officer who shot and killed Terence Crutcher, is being charged with manslaughter in the case, Tulsa County District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler says. Kunzweiler announced the charge Thursday afternoon, six days after Crutcher died in a controversial encounter that was captured on video by a police helicopter camera and dashboard cameras. \u201dA warrant has been issued for her arrest,\u201d and arrangements are being made with Shelby\u2019s attorney for Shelby\u2019s surrender, Kunzweiler said in announcing the felony charge (see video from local TV news KJRH).",
        "If you looked at Google Maps this week, you might have noticed something strange: less green. Typically, mint green highlights designate publicly owned wild spaces on Google\u2019s maps. But as of this writing, some of those public lands have gone gray. The locations are still searchable, but if you don\u2019t already know the park or forest exists, and where exactly, you might not be able to find it. No green space is safe: Many of the missing parks are national forests, but some are state forests, Bureau of Land Management recreation areas, wildlife refuges and wilderness areas.",
        "There are a few elements that reliably form the basis for an Alicia Keys song: heartache or infatuation, an essential tenderness and emotion made heavy with wisdom, a patiently unfurling melody and, of course, that voice, yearning and ready to break, even as it remains in control. Even though these building blocks have helped her stand apart from pop trends while forging a remarkable career, Keys says the making of a classic song is still a mystery to her. Fifteen years after the release of her first album 15 years after her first single, \u201dFallin\u2019\u201d went to No.",
        "Providing details on a large hacking case, Yahoo says it believes \u201dinformation associated with at least 500 million user accounts was stolen.\u201d The company says its investigation suggests the stolen data doesn\u2019t include payment and bank account information, which it says are stored in a different system. Yahoo suspects that a \u201d actor\u201d performed the hack, stealing users\u2019 account information from the company network late in 2014.

        "Yahoo has revealed that it suffered a massive cyber breach in late 2014, which the company believes resulted in theft of information about the accounts of at least 500 million users. The Internet responded in stride \u2014 as it has to all recent news \u2014 with the regular tide of jokes about Yahoo\u2019s dinosaur status. But the reactions, spreading fast through Twitter, also revealed which Yahoo asset is most valuable to this social media demographic: fantasy sports. OK, here are some facts. Yahoo is an Internet giant, with more than 1 billion monthly active users.",
        "The Amazon series Transparent is about a transgender woman named Maura who for decades was known to her kids as Mort, or Dad. Actor Jeffrey Tambor plays Maura and has just won a second Emmy for his performance. \u201dWhen those roles come along, you don\u2019t run away,\u201d he tells NPR\u2019s Kelly McEvers. \u201dIt\u2019s a perfect role, you know?",
        "Take a look at this video: If a word is spelled correctly, the pigeon has been taught to peck at the word. If it\u2019s spelled incorrectly, the pigeon is supposed to peck at the star. When it gets it right, the machine hands it some food. A group of researchers from New Zealand were able to train four pigeons to consistently \u2014 with 70 percent accuracy \u2014 recognize dozens of words. The smartest pigeon learned about 60 words that it could distinguish from about 1, 000 nonwords.",

Early on Thursday, city officials said the victim was shot by another civilian."
