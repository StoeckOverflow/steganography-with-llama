        "Signs rocks tear gas fireworks, police arrest two protesting teens in downtrodent city of Port Arthur \u2013 Houston, we'\n everybody.\nWe got the police here right\naway and that is that. We are\nnow at that place. We are not. You have just gotta\nknow how to do that, right now, in this case. That\nmechanised force, which has been so much talked about, it\u2019s the one who\u2019s in\nthis situation and I don\nt believe it will work and this Both Scott and the officer who shot him are black.",
        "In 1970, archaeologists excavating the site of an ancient synagogue in Israel dug up a cylindrical lump of charcoal that looked like the remains of a scroll. The document was badly burned and battered. It was so delicate, just touching its surface sent pieces flaking off. To attempt to read it by unwrapping the layers would be to destroy the artifact forever. For curious scholars hoping to know what was written inside, the Ein Gedi Scroll was a hopeless enigma. Until now.",
        "Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have spent the summer throwing attacks at one another from across the country and over the Internet. But on Monday night, the two will stand face to face on a debate stage for the first time. The stakes are high for both candidates. Many recent polls have shown a narrow race, and the upcoming debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N. Y. is expected to have a Super audience. Both Clinton and Trump have been preparing for the debate.",
        "The first presidential debate, to be held next Monday, Sept. 26, at Hofstra University in New York, will be divided into three segments on three topics, according to the Commission On Presidential Debates Frank Fahrenkopf. That\u2019s a bit different from the original announcement for the first debate, which said there would be six segments. Farhrenkopf told NPR that it was moderator Lester Holt\u2019s decision to combine the segments. The topics will be: the Direction of America, Achieving Prosperity and Securing America.",
        "The breathtaking sadness of seeing a boy suffering amid Syria\u2019s civil war has prompted a breathtaking offer of hospitality and kindness. The sight of Omran Daqneesh, who was wounded in an airstrike in Aleppo, left many people speechless last month. It also prompted a New York boy named Alex to write to President Obama with a simple request: \u201dCan you please go get him\u201d so Omran can become part of Alex\u2019s family?",
        "If there were a hall of fame for criminals, it would have to include notorious Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar. Escobar made billions making and selling cocaine. He used that money to buy a sprawling estate with elephants and zebras, but also spent it on houses, schools and hospitals for the poor, as well as a successful bid for Congress in Colombia. He was a ruthless killer who once bombed an airliner and was responsible for the deaths of thousands of police officers, government officials and innocent civilians.",
        "Until Sept. 19, if diners had wanted to see Yelp reviews for Elizabeth, N. J. restaurant First American Fried Chicken, they would have found just two of them, praising the food, wide selection and late hours.",
        "A scientist in Sweden has started trying to edit the DNA in healthy human embryos, NPR has learned. The step by the developmental biologist Fredrik Lanner makes him the first researcher known to attempt to modify the genes of healthy human embryos. That has long been considered taboo because of safety and ethical concerns. Lanner is attempting to edit genes in human embryos to learn more about how the genes regulate early embryonic development. He hopes the work could lead to new ways to treat infertility and prevent miscarriages.",
        "There are a lot of ways the most detailed, abstract and sophisticated kinds of science show up in our daily lives. In a nation that sometimes forgets the power and promise of its own scientific endeavor, it\u2019s good to be reminded of that link \u2014 as I was this week when I went in for an MRI on my shoulder. MRI stands for magnetic resonance imaging. Really, though, the process is called NMRI with the N standing for nuclear. The medical field has dropped the \u201dnuclear\u201d part because it freaks a lot of people out.",
        "Born to Run, Bruce Springsteen\u2019s memoir set for release on Tuesday, is a virtuoso performance, the equivalent to one of Springsteen and the E Street Band\u2019s famous concerts: Nothing is left onstage, and diehard fans and alike depart for home sated and yet somehow already aching for more.",
        "Note: NPR\u2019s First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the Spotify playlist at the bottom of the page. When the Pixies in 2004, expectations were high. As a live act, frontman Black Francis and crew \u2014 guitarist Joey Santiago, bassist Kim Deal and drummer David Lovering \u2014 more than delivered. But 10 years later, when the legendary band finally got around to releasing its comeback album, Indie Cindy, things didn\u2019t go so well.",
        "Say one thing for certain: The lists don\u2019t lack for leading lights. When President Obama doled out the 2015 National Medals of Arts and National Humanities Medals on Thursday, plenty of the artists and arts patrons he draped with awards had familiar names \u2014 including Mel Brooks, Morgan Freeman, Terry Gross and nearly two dozen others. (You can check out all the winners of the National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medal at the links, or by simply scrolling further.",
        "Less than a year after China suspended its policy, officials in the central Chinese city of Yichang are asking public servants to have two children. The request came in a public memo from municipal officials posted to the city government website. After more than 35 years, China relaxed restrictions in January, allowing couples nationwide to have a second child if they want to. The statement, which appears to have since been removed from the city\u2019s website, turned that permission into a direct plea for couples to have two children.",
        "When the phone rang, Rebecca thought it was a telemarketer. Instead, it was the MacArthur Foundation calling her at home to tell her she\u2019d just won a grant totaling $625, 000. And she hadn\u2019t even been aware that she\u2019d been nominated for the prestigious award. The MacArthur Fellowships, as they\u2019re officially called, are often dubbed the \u201dgenius grants.\u201d They\u2019re given out each year to 20 to 30 people who \u2014 according to the Foundation\u2019s confidential selection committee \u2014 show \u201dexceptional creativity.\u201d Past winners have included painters, filmmakers, scientists, a human rights lawyers and others.",
        "American composer Julia Wolfe has won one of the biggest windfalls in the arts world. She is one of this year\u2019s MacArthur Fellows, recipients of the \u201dgenius grants\u201d given to a wide range of talented figures from the arts, humanities, sciences and social services. The 2016 class of fellows was announced early Thursday morning. Each fellow receives a $625, 000 grant, which is paid out in equal installments over five years and is unrestricted \u2014 to be used however the individual winner chooses.",
        "Good ideas don\u2019t only come from experts. An innovative engineering program in Texas has been proving that college undergraduates can tackle \u2014 and solve \u2014 vexing health challenges in developing countries. Two engineers at Rice University in Houston are tapping the potential of bright young minds to change the world. Big Problems, Simple Solutions, Rural hospitals in the developing world have lots of problems. Some are huge: lack of electricity, lack of staff, lack of supplies. But some problems are much smaller, and can be overcome with a bit of ingenuity.",
        "In a new episode of Web comedy show Between Two Ferns, Hillary Clinton jokes about what she should wear at next Monday\u2019s debate, attending Donald Trump\u2019s wedding and Chelsea Clinton\u2019s friendship with Ivanka Trump. Comedian host Zach Galifianakis asked the candidate a variety of (not surprisingly) irreverent questions \u2014 like what would happen if Clinton got pregnant in office and whether she ever thinks to herself, \u201dOh, maybe I should be more racist.\u201d The candidate also said she is \u201dnot down\u201d with President Obama\u2019s Partnership deal.",
        "Editor\u2019s Note: Names of sexual assault victims have been changed in this story, to protect their privacy. Haley woke up early one morning in June 2014. She had been out with a few friends at a bar in Ashland, Ore. the night before, and she felt safest going home with them rather than walking home alone. \u201dIt turns out,\u201d she said, \u201dthe creeper that I had to be afraid of was in my circle of friends.\u201d She woke up disoriented.",
        "Each of the photos in Capt. William A. Prickitt\u2019s album could fit in a locket: headshots of 17 black soldiers who served under the Union Army officer during the Civil War, most of their names handwritten on the mat surrounding the images. At just 2 inches tall, the square, album itself could be easily misplaced among the more than 35, 000 artifacts it will join at the Smithsonian\u2019s new National Museum of African American History and Culture when it opens this week in Washington, D. C.",
        "(This post was updated at 2:11 p. m. ET.) Puerto Rico\u2019s governor, Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla, has declared a state of emergency over a power outage that at its peak affected 1. 5 million customers. By morning that number had been cut by a couple hundred thousand, but more than a million customers on the island remained without electricity. The power company, Autoridad de Energia El\u00e9ctrica, said in a tweet that if things go as planned, about half of those customers should have their power restored by the end of the afternoon.",
        "The New York Times recently published a story that examined the way that Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign promoted his tax plan. Trump had offered a big tax break to businesses, and his campaign told a leading business group he supported the tax break. He got their endorsement. Then his campaign told independent budget analysts he was against the same tax break.",
        "You may or may not have noticed, but the 2016 presidential campaign has entered a new phase \u2014 perhaps even a new dimension. It is new, not just for this year\u2019s already extraordinary campaign, but for American political discourse. That is because on Friday, Donald Trump brought forth what may well be the most preposterous falsehood anyone has attempted to peddle in our political life. Think that is hyperbole? Feel free to counter with something to match it. Seriously. Trump spent five years as the indisputable point of the spear for the \u201dbirther\u201d movement.",
        "Law and order has been a major theme this year on the campaign trail. But that means very different things to the two major party presidential candidates. With just under two months to go before the November election, we\u2019re taking a closer look at where Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump stand on issues of crime and policing. Trump has made what he calls a return to law and order a centerpiece of his campaign.",
        "Much of the anger and anxiety in the 2016 election are fueled by the sense that economic opportunity is slipping away for many Americans. This week, as part of NPR\u2019s collaborative project with member stations, A Nation Engaged, we\u2019re asking the question: What can be done to create economic opportunity for more Americans? In Ohio, Columbus has quietly become a model of prosperity, with rising wages and low unemployment. Nearby Springfield, which has seen its manufacturing base erode, is struggling. So what can a city in decline do to make a comeback?",
        "A disturbing feature of this election cycle has been the growth in hate speech online. Jewish journalists, in particular, have received insults, slurs and threats over Twitter and other social media. The League announced this week it is hiring a representative in Silicon Valley to work with tech companies to help fight abuse online. League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt tells NPR\u2019s Ari Shapiro the amount of \u201dvitriol and hatred\u201d during this presidential election has been \u201dstaggering.\u201d Greenblatt says tech companies need to step up their efforts in combating online hate speech.",
        "Here is what happens in the first 100 pages of The Wonder: Lib, an English nurse in the century, is sent to a small town in Ireland, a country whose people she instantly hates, to keep watch over a young girl who claims she has lived without food for four months. Lib watches the girl and thinks unkind things about the Irish. The girl does not eat. That is it. After that, things get slightly more interesting, because there is no way they cannot.",

This week, as part of NPR\u2019s collaborative project with member stations, A Nation Engaged, we\u2019re asking the question: What can be done to create economic opportunity for more Americans?

        "The International Organization for Migration says more people are opting to voluntarily return to their home countries, rather than staying in host countries as migrants. In a report released Friday, the IOM says it assisted more than 51, 000 people leaving host countries, most of them leaving Europe, in the first six months of 2016. By comparison, the organization helped about 69, 000 people in all of 2015. If the current rate continues, 100, 000 people are on track to leave host countries by the end of the year, the IOM says.",
        "After a bitter primary battle that culminated with Ted Cruz being booed off the stage at the Republican National Convention, the Texas senator says he will vote for Donald Trump. In a Facebook post Friday, Cruz wrote that he made the decision because he wants to \u201dkeep his word\u201d to vote for the Republican nominee and because he finds Hillary Clinton \u201dwholly unacceptable.\u201d It was hardly a endorsement.",
        "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump expanded his list of potential Supreme Court nominees Friday. The new list consists of 10 more possible nominees, including a U. S. senator who has refused to endorse Trump. Trump\u2019s additional list, coming just days before the first debate, suggests he wants to add diversity to his earlier list of eight men and three women. The second list, like the first, consists of bedrock conservatives, many with records hostile to abortion rights, marriage and federal regulations."
