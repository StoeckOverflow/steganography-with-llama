No sickness in the whole world by the time today\u2019s babies, like the couple\u2019s daughter Max Zuckerberg, are old folks? Seems like unbelievable hype from the Facebook founder and his pediatrician spouse.

The show of unity comes as a separate protest movement against the Dakota Access Pipeline in the U. S. has galvanized tribes. Earlier this month, as we reported, the U. S. government halted construction in one area particularly sensitive to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which led the protests.",

        "Iranian President Hassan Rouhani came to the United Nations to tout his country\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers and show that Iran is once again open for business. But two British families are doing their best to challenge that image. They, too, were at the U. N. this week, hoping to convince Rouhani that their relatives, held in Iran, should be released.

The South Dakota surgeon had been called to vouch for the expertise of one of his partners whose patient had suffered a stroke and permanent disability after an operation. The problem was that Aanning had, in his own mind, questioned his colleague\u2019s skill. His partner\u2019s patients had suffered injuries related to his procedures. But Aanning understood why his partner\u2019s attorney had called him as a witness: Doctors don\u2019t squeal on doctors.",
        "Back in the 1980s, Davao City was a largely lawless city on the largely lawless island of Mindanao, known to the wider world mostly for its Muslim and communist insurgencies. But on this day, I\u2019m sitting at a Krispy Kreme in the SM Mall, meeting with Vicente Lao, the chairman of the Mindanao Business Council. If Duterte had not been mayor of Davao, he says, this mall probably wouldn\u2019t be here. And without Duterte, he continues, Davao wouldn\u2019t be one of the safer cities in the country. \u201dHe made it that way,\u201d Lao says.",
        "American lives have been getting steadily longer, and since the 1960s that trend has been driven mostly by a remarkable reduction in heart disease. But those improvements have slowed dramatically. Scientists are now wondering whether we\u2019re approaching the end of the trend of longer, healthier lives. That\u2019s because the steady decline in heart disease is fading. Most people alive today don\u2019t remember the days when many people in their 40s and 50s would simply drop dead of a heart attack. But John Kenneth \u201dKen\u201d Carbaugh Jr. does.",

        "Note: NPR\u2019s First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. Dizzy Gillespie once described Charlie Parker as the other half of his heartbeat. They were young men creating something from whole cloth, stretching the limits of their creativity and intellect every time they drew a breath together on the bandstand. For musicians, that heartbeat thing is real. When you link into someone else\u2019s well of creativity and imagination, there really are no words to describe the connection.",

Arriving seven years after the pacifist fable Shane but two years before the The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, John Sturges\u2019 1960 classic is basically a get paean to brotherhood and violent sacrifice. It\u2019s about a small pack of wolves, led by Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen, that decides to protect a flock of sheep from a big pack of wolves led by Eli Wallach. That\u2019s all, and that\u2019s enough.",

Monday\u2019s debate between Clinton and Trump will take place on the 56th anniversary of that first debate.",

In a race this close and with as many as 100 million people watching, the debates present both candidates with chances to seize momentum but potential pitfalls as well. Here are four things to think about as Donald Trump prepares for the debates. We also looked at four things to watch for Clinton.

Of course, I never got a chance to use them, because on the first day of the festival, I was filling up relish trays and taking dinner orders from customers at Schrafft\u2019s. All this came back to me in a rush of memories when I picked up the new book Ten Restaurants that Changed America. Schrafft\u2019s was one of the restaurants listed. \u201dReally\u201d? I thought.",
