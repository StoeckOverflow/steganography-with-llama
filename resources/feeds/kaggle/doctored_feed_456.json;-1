        "Photographer Mustafah Abdulaziz has dedicated the past four years of his life to one thing: taking pictures that tell stories about water. From the barren riverbeds of India to the polluted rivers of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, Abdulaziz has photographed in nine countries, seeking to document the global water woes: According to the World Health Organization, nearly 2 billion people \u201duse a drinking water source contaminated with feces\u201d and by 2025, half of the world\u2019s population will face shortages in their water supply.",
        "Congress had just one thing to do this month before it left town for its October recess. That was to keep the government funded past Sept. 30. But with just under one week left on what was supposed to be a straightforward task, there\u2019s still no deal in sight. There was a fantasy circulating the Senate last week \u2014 that senators would be able to wrap up business and head home three weeks early to get back to campaigning (the Senate had been scheduled to be in the first week of October as well).",
        "When the National Museum of African American History and Culture opens to the public on Saturday afternoon, there will be a lot of artifacts on display \u2014 everything from Frederick Douglass\u2019 formal portrait to a shiny, Cadillac convertible that RB king Chuck Berry once drove onstage. There will also be parts of hidden African American history that are, for many, being made visible for the first time. That\u2019s where Willie Harris comes in.",
        "Just days away from the Oscars, Hollywood continues to face down questions over its lack of diversity \u2014 particularly among the nominees for its top prize. The controversy has helped prompt a viral hashtag, #OscarsSoWhite, and has led the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to pledge to diversify in years to come. For some who have been in Hollywood for decades, though, this is a familiar story. Willie Harris and Alex Brown, two black stuntmen who first tried to break into the movie business in the 1960s, quickly realized that studios wouldn\u2019t hire black stuntmen.",
        "Each month, NPR Music asks a panel of some of public radio\u2019s finest hosts and music curators to share one new song they\u2019re playing on repeat. In September\u2019s mix, you\u2019ll hear the latest from Amanda Shires, The Minders, Izo FitzRoy, Mick Jenkins and more.

        "Racial discrimination, it seems, is like the salt that\u2019s left in a pot after water boils away \u2014 much easier to identify in the absence of the other things. That was one of the big takeaways from a report released this week by the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank in Washington, D. C. Researchers were studying the longstanding wage gap, and their findings were grim: The distance between what white Americans and black Americans earn is larger than it\u2019s been in almost 40 years. I talked to Valerie Wilson, who analyzes race and the economy for the institute.",
        "The new movie Queen of Katwe has a familiar theme: It\u2019s the story of a girl from the slums who discovers an unlikely talent (chess) and becomes an unlikely champion. But in other ways, the film is revolutionary: It may be the first time a major studio (Disney) has set a movie in Africa with all black actors and no animals. The cast includes Lupita Nyong\u2019o, an actress who is on the current (October) cover of Vogue, and Madina Nalwanga, a teenager from a poor neighborhood in Kampala, Uganda, who has never made a movie before.",
        "Here\u2019s a quick roundup of some of the you may have missed on this week\u2019s Morning Edition. Deep in the Heart of Texas, In Texas, high school football serves as the focal point for Friday nights. The whole \u201dClear eyes, full hearts, can\u2019t lose\u201d mantra is real, believe me \u2014 I was in the band. As fierce as the rivalries are though, some of them can\u2019t be left on the field for the teams to duel out.",
        "More than 100 million people are expected to watch the first debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on Monday night, potentially the largest audience for a campaign event in American history. Why? What do we expect from this faceoff? A watershed moment in our history? A basis on which to choose between the candidates? Or just a ripping good show? Obviously, many of us hope to get all three. [The debate from Hofstra University in Hempstead N. Y. will be broadcast live on NPR beginning at 9 p. m.",
        "Golfing legend Arnold Palmer has died at 87. He died Sunday evening at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Shadyside, a tertiary care hospital in Pittsburgh. NPR confirmed his death with UPMC\u2019s media relations manager, Stephanie Stanley. The United States Golf Association announced Palmer\u2019s death via Twitter. Palmer won 62 PGA Tour events, fifth on the list. He won golf\u2019s biggest titles: the Masters, the U. S. Open, the British Open. He won seven majors in all.

He was 24 years old. \u201dThe Miami Marlins organization is devastated by the tragic loss of Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez,\u201d the team posted in a statement on Twitter. \u201dOur thoughts and prayers are with his family at this very difficult time.

S.",
        "For those of us who grew up in Santa Fe, N. M. there are few figures that loom larger than Zozobra. I mean that literally, as much as figuratively: The marionette is as familiar as Santa Claus \u2014 only, instead of stealing away with cookies and milk, Zozobra ends its holiday each year by being ritualistically burned to death before a crowd of tens of thousands of screaming people. Zozobra, which takes its name comes from the Spanish word for pain or despair, \u201drepresents all of the gloom of Santa Fe,\u201d says Kenneth Garley.",
        "Many Americans are familiar with the astronaut heroes of the 20th century space race \u2014 names like Gus Grissom and Neil Armstrong. But who did the calculations that would successfully land these men on the moon? Several of the NASA researchers who made space flight possible were women. Among them were black women who played critical roles in the aeronautics industry even as Jim Crow was alive and well.",
        "Jamie Landrum has been a police officer for two years in District 3 on the west side of the Cincinnati. In late August, the city was hit by 174 overdoses in six days. Landrum says officers were scarce. \u201dWe were literally going from one heroin overdose, and then being on that one, and hearing someone come over [the radio] and say, \u2019I have no more officers left,\u2019 \u201d Landrum says. Three more people overdosed soon after that. Heroin isn\u2019t new in Cincinnati, but the recent surge in overdoses is being blamed on an even more potent drug called carfentanil.",
        "Updated at 10:20 p. m. ET Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has had a strained relationship with Barack Obama, but he\u2019s putting in time to get off on the right foot with whoever succeeds the president. Netanyahu met privately with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for more than an hour at Trump Tower in New York on Sunday morning. Netanyahu met with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for about 50 minutes Sunday evening.

        "Monday night\u2019s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will be the first time the two square off directly during this general election campaign. At such moments, the stakes are invariably characterized as high for the candidates, their presidential prospects on the brink of success or ruin. Or maybe not.",
        "It makes sense that Y La Bamba\u2019s latest album, Ojos Del Sol, is a bilingual journey through cultures and genres. After all, the project comes from frontwoman Luz Elena Mendoza, who carries her multiple identities with pride. Mendoza\u2019s parents are both from Michoacan, Mexico. She was born in San Francisco, but her family soon relocated to southern Oregon, where both of her parents found jobs working at sawmills. Music was a large part of her childhood.",

        "Studs Terkel had a gift for connecting with people and collecting their stories.

All this week on NPR, you\u2019ll hear the voices from the pages of Terkel\u2019s book, thanks to Radio Diaries and Project, which were given exclusive access to the recorded interviews Terkel made for Working.",
        "It\u2019s a strange experience seeing your own passport posted on a website. That\u2019s what happened to me last month after Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry got hacked \u2014 including the documents I\u2019d sent there to get press credentials. The news site showed a letter from my editor, my passport details and identified me as a \u201dAmerican adviser\u201d who was in Ukraine to work on a military radio station in that country. In reality, I was reporting an NPR story on the radio station Army FM, which broadcasts to Ukrainian troops on the country\u2019s eastern front, near the border with Russia.",
        "If you have kids or know kids who complain about their commute to school, then consider the challenges facing the children in the Atule\u2019er village in southwest China\u2019s Sichuan province. The schoolkids are walking vertically each way, and they must navigate steep cliffs, hundreds of feet high, on rickety wooden ladders to get to and from school. It illustrates the yawning chasm between China\u2019s gleaming cities and its impoverished hinterland, and the difficulties faced by China\u2019s many ethnic minorities.",
        "The thing with Crooked Kingdom is you have to decide whether or not you buy Kaz Brekker. Not whether or not you like him, because of course you like him. Who wouldn\u2019t like him? He\u2019s a young thief prodigy, raised on the mean streets of Ketterdam. He\u2019s smarter than everyone and crueler than everyone and cooler than everyone.",
        "In a modest Palestinian home outside the West Bank city of Hebron, two parents try to protect their son, urging him not to tell his story, saying it\u2019s too dangerous. He is 28, has scars on his arms from a motorcycle accident and wears a baseball cap. His smile is bashful. He politely parries his parents\u2019 pleas and says he wants to talk. But he asks NPR to withhold his name and his exact location. He says he could be killed if his critics knew he had spoken to a reporter.",
        "For nearly as long as she\u2019s been in the public eye, Hillary Clinton has counted the of children among her defining causes \u2014 from the bestselling 1996 book (and enduring cliche) It Takes A Village to her advocacy for the State Child Health Insurance Program. This presidential campaign has been no exception, except if anything, she\u2019s been working even harder to draw connections between investments in education and economic growth. Here\u2019s a rundown of her positions from cradle to college. Her opponent Donald Trump has released no such details, but you can read what he may be thinking here.",
        "\u201dI\u2019m a tremendous believer in education.\u201d So begins a campaign ad for Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump. But what does that mean? What does Trump believe about how we should fund and fix our schools, train and pay our teachers, and, most importantly, educate every child whether they\u2019re rich or poor, fluent in English or anything but, learning disabled or two grades ahead? To these questions the candidate has offered few clear answers.",
        "Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton went head to head Monday night in the first presidential debate.

        "The first presidential debate was a tense affair between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump as they clashed over their economic and trade plans, national security and race relations in the U. S. The Republican nominee came out aggressively against Clinton, often interrupting her and talking over her, but the Democratic nominee didn\u2019t pull her punches either and had plenty of zingers ready. And as the night wore on, Trump appeared repeatedly rattled as he was pressed on his past support for the birther movement and controversial comments about women.",
        "This post was updated on Oct. 17. The last of three debates between Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump will take place Wednesday night in Las Vegas.

        "People who have reached their later years may think it\u2019s primarily a time to relax, not to increase their physical activity. Not so. Previous research has suggested that exercise can improve memory and reverse muscle loss in older adults, among other benefits. And a study out Monday finds that a regular program of physical activity reduces the time spent with disability."
