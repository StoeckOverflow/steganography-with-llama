        "It was the first 2016 presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, and NBC\u2019s Lester Holt was moderating. Holt\u2019s topic was how to \u201dheal the divide\u201d between the races, but the conversation had meandered from to lists to the Department of Justice\u2019s 1973 racial discrimination suit against Trump. When Clinton mentioned the discrimination lawsuit, Holt prompted Trump to respond.

        "The control tower at a major metropolitan airport can be a pretty chatty place. Some of the chatter comes from air traffic controllers literally and phonetically spelling out the routes pilots need to follow to their destinations, using the alphabet. When a weather issue \u2014 say, a line of thunderstorms \u2014 pops up, routes have to be changed, often while the plane is already on the taxiway. So the controllers spell out new directions to the pilots, the pilots take them down and then carefully read back the instructions to the tower.",

But \u201dJust because we\u2019re not seeing the same amount of growth as we\u2019ve had in the past six years, it\u2019s not a bad thing because we\u2019re on a record pace,\u201d Caldwell adds.

Sargus Jr. that it had updated its execution protocol. The state intends to use a cocktail that is very similar to the one used in Oklahoma.",

It was supposed to usher in a new age of public transit. It didn\u2019t.

        "You never quite know what to expect when October rolls around. In baseball, it\u2019s a month of miracles \u2014 and of letdown. In politics, it\u2019s all about the element of surprise. The presidential race is rounding third, but anything can happen on the way home. It\u2019s called the \u201dOctober surprise.\u201d The phrase strikes dread in the hearts of supporters of any candidate. Could a hacker release troves of damning emails?

        "Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Pence and Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine met Tuesday evening for the only vice presidential debate of 2016. Many expected the at Longwood University in Farmville, Va. to be a cordial affair, and it largely was, but each came armed with plenty of barbs to throw at the other.
