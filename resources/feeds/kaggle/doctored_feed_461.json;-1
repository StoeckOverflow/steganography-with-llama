        "On her first day back at work after giving birth, Tricia Olson drank copious amounts of coffee, stuffed tissues in her pocket, and tried not to cry. After all, her son Gus was just 3 weeks old. Olson, 32, works for a small towing company and franchise in Rock Springs, Wyo. and she could not afford to be away from work any longer. \u201dThe house bill\u2019s not going to pay itself,\u201d she says, her voice breaking in an audio diary she kept as part of a series on the challenges facing working parents airing on NPR\u2019s All Things Considered.",
        "Fan fervor is one of the basic building blocks of rock and roll, but it\u2019s difficult to recall a rock star as tenderly beloved as is Bruce Springsteen in 2016. There are bigger legends who\u2019ve evinced louder screams, like the baby boomer Boss\u2019s own early inspirations, Elvis and The Beatles.",
        "How do you lose more than $900 million? \u201dI think a good part of it was mistakes,\u201d said Barbara Res, a former executive vice president at the Trump Organization who managed construction at Trump Tower. Res said the mistakes started in the 1980s, when Trump paid $365 million for the Eastern Air Lines Shuttle and $400 million for the Plaza Hotel. \u201dHe overpaid for all that stuff,\u201d said Res. \u201dThose were not wise decisions.",
        "Speculation that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump went years \u2014 maybe decades \u2014 without paying federal income taxes has generated questions about \u201dloopholes\u201d available to real estate developers. Experts say the tax code is indeed riddled with tricky ways to dodge taxes through sophisticated uses of trusts, partnerships, S corporations and so forth. Because Trump refuses to release his tax records, no one can know for sure which strategies he has used to determine his tax burden.",
        "For two weeks, a battle has raged in Aleppo, generating tragic images of injured civilians amid the rubble. The city \u2014 once Syria\u2019s most populous and a commercial hub \u2014 is a key prize in the civil war. For four years, it has been divided between government and rebel forces and was in effect a military stalemate. Russia is among the supporters of Syrian President Bashar Assad, while the U. S. supports rebel forces. They were talking to try to find a way to calm the violence in Syria, but the negotiations collapsed this week.",
        "Specially trained dogs have been known to sniff out explosives, drugs, missing persons and certain cancer cells, but author Alexandra Horowitz tells Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross that extraordinary olfactory abilities aren\u2019t just the domain of working dogs. Horowitz says that all dogs have the ability to create \u201da picture of the world through smell,\u201d thanks, in part, to the design of their snouts. A canine\u2019s nose is \u201dstereoscopic,\u201d she explains, which means that each nostril is controlled separately, allowing the dog not only to detect a particular smell, but also to locate it in space.",
        "Edit note: This report includes some graphic scenes. The Aryan Brotherhood of Texas originated in prison in the early 1980s as a protection racket for white inmates, but as the tattooed gang members were released into the free world, they became one of the most violent crime syndicates in America. Two years ago, the Justice Department trumpeted that it had \u201ddecapitated\u201d the leadership of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas, or ABT. gang members were convicted, including all five regional generals.",
        "Google\u2019s products are everywhere: maps, Gmail, the Chrome browser, the Chromecast system, the Android mobile operating system, YouTube, Waze. But the company has been far less successful at selling things rather than software. Earlier this year, Google scrapped the project to build a modular phone its Nexus phones and tablets are laggards of the industry and we\u2019ll never forget the of Google Glass. But the tech giant is doubling down, with a release of multiple new devices, including a Pixel smartphone and a Google Home digital assistant speaker.",
        "Most of us have been tempted at one time or another by the lure of sugar. Think of all the cakes and cookies you consume between Thanksgiving and Christmastime! But why are some people unable to resist that second cupcake or slice of pie? That\u2019s the question driving the research of Monica Dus, a molecular biologist at the University of Michigan. She wants to understand how excess sugar leads to obesity by understanding the effect of sugar on the brain.",
        "We\u2019ve never done a Tiny Desk Concert that wasn\u2019t behind my desk at NPR. But when the White House called and said they were putting on an event called South by South Lawn, a festival filled with innovators and creators from the worlds of technology and art, including music, we jumped at the chance to get involved. We chose Common as the performer and the White House library as the space. This Tiny Desk Concert was a convergence of art and soul, mixing politics with heart.",

Wells Fargo is embroiled in a scandal for taking advantage of customers by opening as many as 2 million accounts without their consent. The bank fired 5, 300 mostly workers over the wrongdoing.

        "The European Parliament voted Tuesday to ratify the landmark Paris climate accord, paving the way for the international plan to curb greenhouse gas emissions to become binding as soon as the end of this week. With U. N. Ban watching, representatives from the 28 European Union member countries voted 610 to 38 in favor of the agreement. Now, each individual country must sign off before the ratification documents can be formally presented to the United Nations.",
        "Sabrina Chang, 30, didn\u2019t know much about the global refugee crisis. \u201dI think I could spit out headlines that I\u2019ve seen, but that\u2019s about it,\u201d she says. But then she found herself \u2014 for a moment \u2014 in refugees\u2019 shoes. Chang visited Forced From Home, a touring interactive exhibition hosted by Doctors Without Borders, the medical aid group. The exhibit is a of a refugee camp, about the size of half a school gymnasium, with a store, a hospital and places to sleep.",
        "On a gray and rainy day, they poured onto the streets of Polish cities by the thousands. The women wore black, waved black flags and raised black umbrellas overhead \u2014 gathering on \u201dBlack Monday\u201d to protest a proposed ban on abortion. In Poland, abortion is already illegal except in cases of rape, incest, danger to the mother\u2019s life or irreparable damage to a fetus.

        "A federal health list specifically guarantees some women\u2019s health coverage available without a copay or deductible, so what about men\u2019s health? And what options are available for coverage for people who travel frequently? Here are the answers to some recent questions from readers. Why aren\u2019t there preventive health recommendations for men like there are for women under the health law? Women and breast cancer get so much attention by the health care community. Heart health, diabetes, prostate cancer and colon cancer are a few examples of opportunities for education and preventive screening for men.",
        "The tea gardens of Darjeeling, in the foothills of the Himalayas, produced significantly less than 1 percent of India\u2019s 2. 6 billion pound output last year. Yet Darjeelings are considered the \u201dChampagne of teas,\u201d the finest in the country and some of the most exquisite and in the world. The harvesting season in Darjeeling runs from through November, as the tea bushes gradually progress through a quartet of distinct seasons known as \u201dflushes.\u201d The tea is often sold not only by single estate (like wine) but also by flush.",
        "Science seems to give us a clean path from its claims to their vindication. Fire a rocket in just the right way, says science, and in a year it will get to Mars. Mix a cocktail of just these chemicals, it tells us, and you can cure a pernicious disease. In a world of iPhones and MRIs, it\u2019s hard to miss the power of these scientific truths. But what about the truths expressed by poetry or dance or theater? What about truths discovered in history or philosophy? Are they simply lesser versions of the truth?",
        "Recently, actor Ben Affleck spoke with The Associated Press and revealed the title of the solo Batman film he\u2019s slated to direct. Ready? The Batman, he said. Perhaps sensing that this announcement would be greeted with the collective shrug it has been, he immediately built himself a verbal escape clause: \u201dAt least, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going with now.\u201d There\u2019s plenty of time to change it there\u2019s still not a finished script.

        "The Nobel Prize in Physics for 2016 has been awarded to three theoretical researchers for their insights into the odd behavior of matter in unusual phases, like superconductors, superfluid films and some kinds of magnets. David J. Thouless receives half the prize, and Duncan M. Haldane and J. Michael Kosterlitz share the other half. All three used mathematics to explain the the properties of matter in certain states. Their work relied on the field of topology, which describes properties that only change in integer steps.",
        "The U. S. and the Philippines began their annual joint exercises on Tuesday, highlighting the alliance between the two countries even as the Philippine president calls for an end to the practice. President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s suggestion that combat exercises will end is part of a string of comments, including inflammatory and offensive ones, which have indicated his willingness to distance himself from the United States. He\u2019s also suggested he might align his country more closely with China and Russia. All those remarks come amid intense criticism from the U. S.",
        "Two years ago, William McNeil lost his retail job at Sears and was looking to improve his life. Around the same time, he got a bunch of emails promising a path to a new career from ITT Technical Institute, the college chain. So, McNeil, who\u2019s 57, signed up online to get more information about the school and got several calls from an ITT recruiter. Desperate to get back on track, he decided it was worth the $20, 000 in loans to pursue an associate\u2019s degree in networking technology at the school.",
        "The U. S. government has charged a federal contractor with the theft of government property and removal of classified materials, including multiple top secret documents that would pose a threat to U. S. security if disclosed, the Justice Department said Wednesday. The government produced the documents through \u201dsensitive sources, methods and capabilities,\u201d and revealing the documents would expose those methods, the Justice Department said in a statement.

Board of Education ruled racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional \u2014 a watershed moment for the modern civil rights movement in America. Yet 2016 began with one of the nation\u2019s top educators \u2014 the secretary of education \u2014 declaring that the job of desegregating the nation\u2019s public schools is far from over: \u201dThere are communities around this country that have schools that are more segregated today than they were 10 years or 20 years ago,\u201d John B. King Jr. said in January.",
        "After mass street protests in Poland, legislators with the country\u2019s ruling party have abruptly reversed their positions and voted against a proposal to completely ban abortion. The proposed law still has to be voted on by the lower house of Parliament on Thursday, where lawmakers can either reject it entirely or send it back to a parliamentary committee for more consideration, The Associated Press reports. Prominent members of the Law and Justice party have signaled that the ban won\u2019t be moving forward.",
        "The U. S. and the Philippines are allies, but you would never know it from the way President Rodrigo Duterte is talking these days. Since his election in June, Duterte has been unleashing rhetoric, which has included demands that the U. S. withdraw special operations forces helping to fight Islamists in the southern Philippines.

        "Human life spans have been increasing for decades thanks to advances in treating and preventing diseases and improved social conditions. In fact, longevity has increased so much in recent decades that some researchers began to wonder: What is the upper limit on human aging? \u201dWe never had so many centenarians as we have now,\u201d says Jan Vijg, who studies molecular genetics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. \u201dMaybe we can actually live much longer than 100.",
        "Women had a lot to say about what works \u2014 and what doesn\u2019t \u2014 for treating morning sickness, after we ran a post summarizing the evidence for home remedies and meds. NPR\u2019s Facebook feed lit up with comments from women saying that ginger, acupressure and other home remedies, which were recommended for mild symptoms in a medical journal article published Tuesday, did nothing to tame their nausea and vomiting.

ET, \u201dDirty water everywhere.\u201d That\u2019s how Jacqueline Charles of the Miami Herald described the situation in Haiti, in an interview with NPR Wednesday morning. \u201dA lot of rain and a lot of wind,\u201d she said. \u201dBefore [Hurricane] Matthew, the ground was already saturated, so the idea that you could have 25 inches of rain is a very scary thought.\u201d Charles says state and local governments are so they do not have the capacity to move people, even after voluntary evacuation orders were issued as the storm lashed the island Tuesday.",
