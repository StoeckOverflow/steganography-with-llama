        "After the first presidential debate and heading into Round 2 on Sunday, Hillary Clinton has taken what appears to be a firm lead over Donald Trump. According to the latest NPR Battleground Map, the Democrat once again clears 270 electoral votes, the threshold needed to be president, with just the states leaning in her direction. She would win the presidency at this point without any of the tossups, states that could go to either Clinton or Trump. That means Clinton could win without Florida, North Carolina, Nevada and Arizona (the tossups).",
        "As a young musician coming up in the early 1970s, Bruce Springsteen played in the bars of Asbury Park, N. J. a hardscrabble urban beach town full of colorful characters. The town fired his imagination and inspired him musically, but still he found himself longing for more. Springsteen tells Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross that he knew that if he was ever going to make his mark on the larger world, it would be through his words. \u201dI looked at myself and I just said, \u2019Well, you know, I can sing but I\u2019m not the greatest singer in the world.",
        "More than five months after its last execution, Texas is set to execute Barney Ronald Fuller Jr. who was convicted of killing two of his neighbors. As we\u2019ve reported, the country as a whole has seen a dramatic decrease in the number of convicts put to death. As the Texas Tribune reports, this trend seems to also be affecting Texas, a leader in executions.",

When I ask how much he\u2019ll make now that the has become Hong Kong\u2019s youngest legislator in city history, he quietly does the calculation in his head. \u201dIt\u2019s around 12, 000 U. S. dollars a month,\u201d he finally says, \u201dbut I\u2019m going to donate much of that to the social movement.\u201d The 2014 Umbrella Movement was named after the umbrellas used to shield protesters from pepper spray and tear gas from police.",
        "Little has gone as expected in this extraordinary presidential cycle, so we should have known Tuesday\u2019s vice presidential debate would have a twist or two in it, too. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence each represented three clients in their debate from Farmville, Va. The two former attorneys pleaded the case for their respective principals (Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump) to be sure, but also for their respective parties and for themselves. It may be said that both succeeded in all three pursuits, with perhaps the clearest success on behalf of their own cases.",
        "The only vice presidential debate between Democrat Tim Kaine and Republican Mike Pence was a bit more heated than expected. For 90 minutes on Tuesday night they sparred on foreign policy, abortion and immigration. But the biggest shadows hanging over them were their running mates. Pence had to defend many controversial things Donald Trump has said \u2014 and often he outright denied Trump had said those things, even though video evidence shows otherwise.",
        "In the far corner of a dirt lane in Katwe, one of Uganda\u2019s most slums, a small boy sits on a step peering into a cramped room where Robert Katende addresses a group of teenagers. At the front of the room a large chess board with magnetic pieces hangs on the wall. Beside it is a whiteboard with a line down the middle. It reads \u201dCompare: Chess Vs. Life.\u201d Under \u201dChess\u201d Katende has written: \u201dOpening\u201d Under \u201dLife\u201d: \u201dBirth\u201d \u201dYou can\u2019t decide where the pieces begin in chess, just like you can\u2019t decide where to be born,\u201d Katende says.",
        "Days after explicit pornography was shown on a large video screen along a busy intersection in Jakarta, a man who\u2019s accused of hacking the billboard is facing charges of immoral actions \u201d and a maximum punishment of six years in prison. The video played for several minutes at the start of the afternoon rush hour last Friday afternoon.

        "Architecture was one of Adolf Hitler\u2019s passions, and he commissioned hundreds of buildings and arenas reminiscent of imperial Rome to inspire and intimidate. It\u2019s a legacy Germany has struggled to erase by or razing structures. The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, for example, was placed in an old SS barracks in Nuremburg, while the German Finance Ministry took over the Nazi aviation building in Berlin. The Berlin bunker where Hitler spent his final days was reduced to a parking lot. Usually there\u2019s little or no complaint about these refurbishments.",
        "Bill Clinton was at a rally in Michigan riffing about the American health care system, riffing being a favorite pastime of the former president. He was getting to a point about how his wife, Hillary Clinton, hopes to improve the Affordable Care Act. But before he could get there, he described \u201dthis crazy system\u201d where under Obamacare millions more people have health coverage but some have seen \u201dtheir premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.\u201d Clinton topped it off with a line that rapidly created headline headaches for his wife\u2019s campaign.",
        "The 2016 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded to three scientists for their groundbreaking work on molecular machines \u2014 tiny, structures with moving parts capable of performing tasks. Sauvage, Sir J. Fraser Stoddart and Bernard L. Feringa share the prize equally. Sauvage linked two tiny rings to create a molecular chain, or \u201dcatenane,\u201d in 1983 Stoddart designed a \u201drotaxane,\u201d or a ring on an axle and Feringa designed the first molecular motor by making a motor blade spin in one direction. Building on those basic parts, chemists have designed molecular muscles, elevators and cars.",

        "One man died and four were injured in January after a clinical trial went awry in Rennes, France. Now, Biotrial, the company that ran that study, said it has opened a new research facility in Newark, N. J. Biotrial conducts clinical trials on behalf of drugmakers and biotechnology companies. Most are phase 1 trials, in which an experimental drug is tried in a small group of volunteers to make a preliminary assessment of its safety before the drug moves on to larger human studies to further evaluate safety and also its effectiveness in treating an illness.",

But a beer can thrown from the stands in Toronto\u2019s Rogers Centre added insult to injury. The can, tossed late in the seventh inning, narrowly missed outfielder Hyun Soo Kim.

        "Blackberries grow so voraciously in the Pacific Northwest that it\u2019s not rare to stumble across rural barns or abandoned homes that have been completely consumed by the thorny vine. Let them grow too close to a window, and they\u2019ll break the glass. They\u2019re common \u2014 easy to forage and hard to get too excited about. At least compared to the marionberry, a type of blackberry that has become an Oregon obsession. One of the reasons the marionberry is so beloved is because it is entirely a product of Oregon. It\u2019s \u201dborn and raised\u201d in state, so to speak.",

        "Both Tim Kaine and Mike Pence brought their faith into Tuesday night\u2019s debate, emphasizing their religious beliefs and even quoting the Bible. Kaine is a devout Catholic Pence grew up Catholic but is now an evangelical Christian, and together they are proof that Christian faith can drive the beliefs of voters across the political spectrum.",
        "America has a scary clown problem. Last month, the reported on a spate of sightings across America. It seemed to begin in Greenville, S. C. where there were reports that \u201dsuspicious clowns were attempting to lure children into the woods.\u201d That was followed by sightings in Alabama, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, with arrests made in Alabama and Kentucky. Many sightings were hard to verify, leaving people wondering: Jokes? Hoaxes? Figment of our collective imaginations? Cyclical clown uprising? The reports were unsettling even for those who don\u2019t suffer coulrophobia, or the fear of clowns.",

S. attorney in Baltimore came into public view this week for prosecuting a contractor accused of stealing National Security Agency secrets.

        "The teenage brain has been characterized as a machine, looking for quick rewards and thrills instead of acting responsibly. But these behaviors could actually make teens better than adults at certain kinds of learning. \u201dIn neuroscience, we tend to think that if healthy brains act in a certain way, there should be a reason for it,\u201d says Juliet Davidow, a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University in the Affective Neuroscience and Development Lab and the lead author of the study, which was published Wednesday in the journal Neuron.",

        "Hurricane Matthew, a powerful Category 4 hurricane, is churning just off the coast of Florida. As Weather. com points out, the tropical cyclone has already shattered all kinds of records: It\u2019s the Category 4 or 5 storm in the Caribbean it became the southernmost Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic basin and it became the longest lived Category hurricane in October.

        "Legacy Community Health Services, a federally qualified health center, is trying hard to fight the Zika virus. It\u2019s screening pregnant women and following federal guidelines to test people at risk. But despite best efforts, there\u2019s a problem, says Legacy\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr. Ann Barnes. Pregnant women (and, often, their sexual partners) who get tested for Zika frequently have to wait as long as a month to know if they are indeed infected, and the pregnancy is at risk. That\u2019s the turnaround time from the state public health lab, where blood samples are sent for testing.",
