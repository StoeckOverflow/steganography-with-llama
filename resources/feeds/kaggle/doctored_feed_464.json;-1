        "Have you ever noticed that you are always busy doing everything, yet never really feel like all this hard work you'll put up on social channels and on your blog?\nYou might not feel it now but I know you feel the friggging pressure to do more and you'd rather spend all day at Disneyland. So here I will help to show that there actually exists more than one strategy in blogging (or content strategy) - one for blog growth, for engagement or simply because the other works out fine.",
        "It\u2019s hard enough to eat nut- and egg based sn But for those in prison, it can be almost impossible. Behind bars, it often takes ingenuity, a hodgepodge of commissary items and food shipped from loved ones to even approximate a proper diet. This is what Albert \u201dProdigy\u201d Johnson, of the influential duo Mobb Deep \u2014 you might remember their \u201990s hit single \u201dShook Ones, Part II\u201d \u2014 discovered after he was sentenced for illegally possessing a firearm in 2007.",
        "Tim Bauerschmidt left home when he was 19. He would call or visit his parents in Michigan occasionally. Decades went by. After his father died last year, he knew his mother couldn\u2019t live by herself. She was 90, and he realized he didn\u2019t know her that well. \u201dI had some stilted conversations,\u201d says Bauerschmidt. \u201dShe\u2019d be on the other end of the phone when I talked to my dad.

        "The U. S. economy generated 156, 000 new jobs in September, according to the monthly jobs report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The results did not meet expectations: Economists had predicted between 170, 000 and 176, 000 new jobs for September. In the previous report for August, the U. S. economy had been reported to have 151, 000 new jobs, with a steady unemployment rate. But Friday\u2019s BLS report revised that number sharply upward, to 167, 000.",
        "Mammography can prevent deaths from breast cancer, but it\u2019s not a perfect test. It misses some cancers, especially in women with dense breast tissue, and flags abnormalities for tests that turn out to be benign, among other issues. So there\u2019s a lot of interest in additional tests that might make screening more accurate in women who have dense breasts. Many of those women may be wondering about extra screening after receiving notification letters saying that their mammogram was clean, but that their dense breasts put them at higher risk of cancer.",
        "Reaction to the video of Donald Trump using explicit language and apparently describing himself forcing himself on women continues to roll in. And it is not good for the GOP nominee. Prominent Republicans are calling on him to drop out and elected officials are running from him and fast. See the full list of Republicans calling on Trump to step down at the bottom on this post. The candidate isn\u2019t backing down, telling the Washington Post\u2019s Robert Costa in an interview today, \u201dI\u2019d never withdraw.",
        "Excerpts from speeches Hillary Clinton was paid to give to big banks suggest a relationship with Wall Street that is a lot more familiar and pragmatic than the fiery rhetoric she has sometimes used on the campaign trail. \u201dI represented all of you for eight years. I had great relations and worked so close together after to rebuild downtown, and a lot of respect for the work you do and the people who do it,\u201d she told a Goldman Sachs symposium on Oct. 24, 2013.",
        "The controversial whistleblower organization WikiLeaks on Friday released emails that they say are linked to Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. While much of the new batch of hacked emails are benign newsletters and shared articles, one note in particular has gotten attention for offering a glimpse into Hillary Clinton\u2019s paid Wall Street speeches. The email depicts Clinton acknowledging the security issues with using her BlackBerry and suggests that she considers herself a political moderate. It also alleges that she dreams of \u201dopen trade and open borders,\u201d among other topics.",
        "Making landfall Saturday, Hurricane Matthew brought floods and strong winds to the coastline of South Carolina and North Carolina, pouring rain into an area and bringing a dangerous storm surge. As of 5 p. m. ET, the storm\u2019s center was around 15 miles of Cape Fear, N. C. The storm made landfall near McClellanville, S. C. (about 35 miles northeast of Charleston) and worked its way up along the coast. As it did so, Matthew brought rains as far away as Virginia and Washington, D. C.",

        "Would you trust your smartphone to guide your drinking habits? A lot of people are doing just that. With many of us glued to our digital devices for much of the day, web developers and medical researchers are taking note of the potential for harnessing our phones, tablets and laptops as tools to moderate drinking, or stay sober after quitting booze. drink tracking and alcohol control programs have mushroomed in recent years, ranging from the whimsically named ?",
        "Latinos are by far the fastest growing chunk of the U. S. school population. A new report by the National Council of La Raza gives a fascinating snapshot of this population. Here are some highlights: Demographics, Achievement: The Good News, The not so good news from the NCLR report is that Latino students still face big challenges. All of this, of course, has implications, not just for Latino youth but for the nation\u2019s schools. This is probably most in the challenge of educating English Language Learners (ELLs).",
        "There are few living theater directors who can convince audiences to stay up all night watching the staging of a Sanskrit poem. But 30 years ago, director Peter Brook did just that. He put on what came to be known as one of the great theater events of the 20th century: The Mahabharata. It was nine hours long, and it was epic. Now, inspired by the civil war in Syria, the director has decided to a part of that poem \u2014 but this time he\u2019s thinking small. Brook\u2019s new play, Battlefield, starts after a catastrophic war.",
        "If there\u2019s one thing Rick Astley hasn\u2019t given up, it\u2019s music. The British singer, who is perhaps best known for his 1987 single, \u201dNever Gonna Give You Up\u201d \u2014 and the common Internet gag, \u201drickrolling,\u201d inspired by it \u2014 is back with a new album. 50 is already topping the charts in the United Kingdom, and it just went on sale in North America this week. \u201dIt\u2019s been a crazy few months, to be honest,\u201d Astley says. \u201dI don\u2019t think anybody around me or anybody who knows me was expecting that, to have a No.",
        "The Syrian civil war could be on the verge of its worst bloodshed yet \u2014 the wholesale destruction of the eastern side of Aleppo, one of the country\u2019s most important cities. This is the warning the United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, sounded in desperation this past week about Aleppo. Since the collapse of a ceasefire last month, the Syrian government and its Russian allies have stepped up attacks on the eastern side of the city, which is held by rebels. \u201dTwo months, months, the city of eastern Aleppo, at this rate, may be totally destroyed,\u201d said de Mistura.",
        "Tourists to the Napa Valley may visit the exclusive wineries and restaurants. But locals love a more humble dish called malfatti. It\u2019s a little spinach and cheese dumpling, shaped like a pinky finger, smothered in sauce and packed with local history. The most famous malfatti in the region is found in the back of Val\u2019s Liquor in the town of Napa.

        "Back in 2002, California passed a law that provides paid family leave benefits to eligible workers. In many ways, the law mimicked paid parental leave policies that are in effect in nearly every other country in the world. But it was the first its kind in the U. S. and several other states have since followed suit. Here\u2019s how California\u2019s law, part of of the state\u2019s disability insurance program, works: Most workers in the state have small deductions (less than one percent of their wages) withheld from each paycheck.",

He went on to become a manager in our research and archives division, and shared his love of music with our audience in stories he wrote for broadcast and online. He was also an accomplished guitarist, whose work made an impression on a young Bob Boilen decades ago, sparking a friendship that continued when they began working together. We lost Robert on Friday night after a prolonged battle with cancer. He was just 66 years old.",

The products are made by MAC Cosmetics, a subsidiary of Estee Lauder, with the cooperation of the singer\u2019s heirs.

        "It\u2019s hard to be any more gobsmacked about the state of the presidential race right now, after a video of Donald Trump making vulgar comments about women surfaced Friday, prompting more than 30 prominent Republicans to call for him to step aside as the nominee. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is also in headlines for a WikiLeaks email dump that included alleged excerpts of her speeches to Wall Street banks.",

        "Donald Trump has apologized for his vulgar comments about women that were revealed in a recording obtained by the Washington Post on Friday. But is he truly sorry for his attempt to seduce a married woman and for boasting about groping women he\u2019d just met? That may be the question for some Republicans who haven\u2019t yet joined the growing chorus of calls for Trump to withdraw his candidacy as he heads into Sunday night\u2019s second presidential debate of the general election cycle.",
        "Ahead of the second presidential debate Sunday night, the secret Donald Trump audiotape of him bragging about groping and kissing women \u2014 and let\u2019s be clear, if he did what he\u2019s bragging that he did, it would be assault \u2014 has shaken the presidential race and is reshaping the presidential map. Yes, the majority of Trump\u2019s supporters are likely to stay with him, but any chance he had at winning over those persuadable voters might very well be gone.",
        "Reacting to the recent release of audio of Donald Trump making vulgar comments about women, President Obama called the candidate \u201dinsecure\u201d and said he \u201dpumps himself up by putting other people down \u2014 not a character trait I would advise for somebody in the Oval Office.\u201d Obama spoke about Trump at a planned event Sunday in Chicago for Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth, who is running for an Illinois Senate seat. Trump and Hillary Clinton debate tonight in St. Louis for the first time after the audio was released.",
        "Middle school is tough. Bodies change. Hormones rage. Algebra becomes a reality. But there are things schools can do to make life easier for students \u2014 like this big study we wrote about showing that schools may be better for kids than traditional middle schools. But aside from an entire school system, are there other ways to make the experience better?

        "A few years ago, a pair of sociologists named Andrew Papachristos and Christopher Wildeman decided to study gun violence in Chicago. They focused on a specific community on the west side: overwhelmingly black and disproportionately poor, with a murder rate that was five times higher than the rest of the city. Their approach was to look at gun violence the way epidemiologists study disease \u2014 examining the way it spread by social connections. And like a virus, they found that there were certain people who were especially at risk of being touched by it.",
        "Brian Eno. David Bowie. Kraftwerk. Radiohead. Aphex Twin. The National. These are just some of the contemporary artists and bands who have looked up to American composer Steve Reich. Since the 1960s, Reich\u2019s hypnotic and coolly modern music has won him fans across many genres, as well as a Pulitzer Prize. Earlier this month, Reich celebrated his 80th birthday \u2014 and he\u2019s being feted in concerts around the world this year. So I headed to his home in upstate New York to speak about his career so far, and what\u2019s next. Steve Reich is a quintessential New Yorker."
