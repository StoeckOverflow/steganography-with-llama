        "Hillary Clinton, who has long been public enemy No. 1 for many in the Republican Party, is now making a direct appeal to Republican and independent voters turned off by Donald Trump. For months, her campaign has been courting these voters, but as Clinton and her team see it, the events of the past week have given them a much wider opening. Her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, is in open warfare with members of his own party and is still reeling from the release of a 2005 video where he boasted about groping women.",
        "A class of from Green Acres Elementary in Lebanon, Ore. asked us to find out how pencil lead is made. That quest took us all the way back to the dawn of the universe and then all the way up to a factory in Jersey City, N. J. In the process, we learned that pencil lead (actually not lead at all but a mineral called graphite) has a storied past. A graphite windfall, Here\u2019s the legend: In the century, a storm uprooted a tree in England\u2019s Lake District.",
        "Christian Siriano has been designing clothing since he was a teenager. He\u2019s 31 now, and for the past decade he and his company have been making clothing for women of all shapes and sizes. You could say Siriano is having a moment: Michelle Obama wore one of his dresses to the Democratic National Convention in July, he featured five models at September\u2019s New York Fashion Week and he dressed nine of the stars on the red carpet for this year\u2019s Emmys.",
        "Cable giant Comcast Corp. has been ordered by federal regulators to pay $2. 3 million for wrongfully charging customers for gear and services they never requested. Officials say it is the largest civil penalty imposed on a cable operator. On Tuesday, the Federal Communications Commission ordered Comcast to pay the fine after investigating complaints that some customers were charged for equipment such as boxes, and services such as premium channels even after they had specifically rejected offers from Comcast representatives. That practice, known as \u201dnegative option billing,\u201d is illegal under federal law.",
        "The restaurant inside the new National Museum of African American History and Culture offers food that satisfies the hunger \u2014 and a space that satisfies the mind.

        "Hillary Clinton on Tuesday rolled out a new tax break that, if enacted, would put more money into the pockets of working parents with very young children. The Democratic presidential candidate said she would push for a doubling of the current $1, 000 tax credit for children ages 4 and under. An estimated 15 million children would be eligible. The new help would come in the form of a tax credit, which cuts the amount of federal taxes owed dollar for dollar.",
        "A riff by Donald Trump at a rally in Pa. on Monday night about Hillary Clinton\u2019s culpability in the deaths of the U. S. ambassador and three other Americans in Benghazi, Libya, is raising questions about where exactly Trump got his information and how. During his speech, Trump held up a piece of paper. \u201dThis just came out a little while ago. I have to tell you this,\u201d Trump said as he read from the page, which he identified as an email from Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal. \u201dThe attack was almost certainly preventable,\u201d Trump read.",
        "The Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday in a case testing whether judges may inquire into allegations of racial bias in jury deliberations. The court was divided, though the justices seemed to agree the case before them presented \u201dsmoking gun\u201d evidence of racial discrimination. Legal rules in most states bar judges from hearing testimony about jury deliberations after a trial is over. While the Supreme Court has generally upheld these rules, it has left open whether such juror inquires might be justified in extreme cases.",
        "The World Health Organization has already urged us to cut back on sugar, limiting added sugars to no more than 10 percent of our daily calories. So, how might policymakers get people to follow this advice? In a new report, the WHO is urging governments around the world to tax soda and other sugary drinks. In its report, the World Health Organization points to systematic reviews of policies aimed at improving diet and preventing lifestyle diseases, such as obesity and diabetes.",
        "The Dumont section of Port Salut on Haiti\u2019s southwest coast is spread over rolling green hills that used to be rich with coconut, mango and banana trees. But Hurricane Matthew toppled most of those trees. It tore apart the simple concrete and houses in the area. It killed livestock, destroyed crops, smashed businesses. Emmanuello Charlien is part of a team trying to tally the damage of Matthew here. Charlien points out a pile of metal that used to be a cellphone tower. \u201dNatcom, which is a cellphone company, used to have a tower right there,\u201d Charlien says.",
        "Who\u2019s in charge of the aid? That\u2019s the question in the southwest of Haiti. Should politicians hand it out? Or aid groups? Or religious leaders? Pastor Louis Masil, who lives in the tiny village of Banatte, doesn\u2019t think the government should be in control. \u201dSince the independence of Haiti, the culture was always all governments, all officials only care for themselves,\u201d he says. \u201dThey only care for stealing the money and not helping the communities.\u201d In his village, on the outskirts of the seaport of Les Cayes, no politicians or aid officials have come to survey the damage.",
        "When Hurricane Matthew lost strength and headed out to sea over the weekend, the storm took its high winds and driving rains with it. But it left behind water \u2014 from the record rains that fell during its trip up the southeastern U. S. coast. And particularly in North Carolina, the storm has continued to threaten lives as floodwaters rise, sometimes to record levels, flowing over the banks of rivers and threatening dams. The hurricane killed hundreds of people in Haiti and elsewhere in the Caribbean, and more than people in the U. S.",
        "Last week, after I played a monstrously good guitar rock cut by Major Stars, Bob Boilen rolled his eyes while foolishly claiming the guitar solo was dead. So we did an entirely scientific poll (it wasn\u2019t scientific) on Twitter to see what listeners thought. As I expected, the vast majority \u2014 nearly 70 percent \u2014 said, \u201dNo, Bob.\u201d The guitar solo is not dead. So this week, after rubbing Bob\u2019s face in it (it\u2019s the only way they learn) I took pity and allowed him the first spin.",
        "As part of an project called A Nation Engaged, NPR has been asking people this presidential election year what it means to be an American. Jan Mapou has owned a Haitian bookstore in Miami for 25 years. It\u2019s on 2nd Avenue in Little Haiti, a lively business district of pastel colored shops with restaurants, a variety store, barbershop and corner markets. \u201dAnything about the history of Haiti you\u2019ll find in here, about religion, about poetry, novels, I got it,\u201d he says of his shop.

        "For years, President Obama has been saying the U. S. must send humans to Mars. Permanently. There was the 2010 speech when he said, \u201dBy the I believe we can send humans to orbit Mars and return them safely to Earth. And a landing on Mars will follow.",
        "Last spring everything changed for Denver resident Matt Larson. \u201dOne day I was fine,\u201d says Larson. \u201dThe next I was being rushed by ambulance to Denver Health following two very massive and violent seizures.\u201d The force of the seizures, from the sheer shaking, fractured and dislocated his shoulders and snapped two bones in his back. Soon his providers had test results. \u201dThey came back and shut the door and said \u2019you have mass on your brain,\u2019 which was tough to hear,\u201d says Larson. The diagnosis, a malignant brain tumor called an anaplastic oligodendroglioma, rocked his world.",
        "The last time Zimbabwe went into economic freefall, in 2009, inflation was a 200 million percent. Shoppers had to carry the colorful bank notes, in and denominations, in bags to pay for basics. To address the crisis, President Robert Mugabe\u2019s government abandoned Zimbabwe\u2019s own currency and adopted the U. S. dollar as legal tender. That helped end hyperinflation and helped stabilize Zimbabwe\u2019s economy. But today, the economy is again in a tailspin and the country is in desperate need of a new solution. U. S. dollars are still the main currency, but they are in critically short supply.",
        "When you\u2019re facing a major life change, it helps to talk to someone who\u2019s already been through it. All Things Considered is connecting people on either side of a shared experience, and they\u2019re letting us eavesdrop on their conversations in our series Been There. On May 31, 2015, Austin Beggin\u2019s life changed forever. He had just graduated from college and started a new job at Nabisco. The family was on a beach vacation in St. George Island, Fla.

        "The bombs continue to fall on areas of Aleppo. Less than a month after a unraveled, Syrian and Russian warplanes have continued attacks in the divided Syrian city. On Tuesday, the U. K.

        "There is a startup in the love industry that promised to help people find real relationships \u2014 not just sex. But, as with so many things in love, it didn\u2019t go according to plan. The app became yet another hookup app. Today, after 10 months of the startup is making a very public commitment to change. It\u2019s called Hinge, and it\u2019s based in Manhattan\u2019s Flatiron District. Back in January, it was coming to grips with a crisis.",
        "Want to know why the Philippines president, Rodrigo Duterte, seems to hate the U. S. so much? The roots go back more than a century, but there\u2019s a more recent reason as well. For that, look no farther than the Evergreen Hotel in the southern city of Davao, where Duterte served as mayor for more than 20 years. It\u2019s a rundown flophouse, up a long flight of stairs in the middle of Chinatown. At $15 a night, it\u2019s way overpriced.",
        "Today is Fire Festival in northern Ghana. It\u2019s a holiday I\u2019d never heard of before I came to live in a village here as a Peace Corps community volunteer. It\u2019s incredibly intense. And it\u2019s one of my favorite celebrations. On Fire Festival \u2014 Bugim Chugu in the local language \u2014 drums beat a quick and pulsating rhythm that summons people to dance in a rotating circle of bodies, large and small, old and young, holding torches of burning grass above their heads.",
        "Pez Owen was flying over the desert in her Cessna airplane when she spotted a huge \u201dX\u201d etched in the desert below. She says it was the strangest thing. \u201dIt\u2019s not on the [flight] chart,\u201d Owen says. \u201dThere just wasn\u2019t any indication of this huge cross.\u201d Then she spotted another one. \u201dThere had to be some reason,\u201d she says. \u201dSo, of course, I immediately thought I had to get Chuck in on this.\u201d Chuck Penson is her former colleague from the University of Arizona.

        "Scientists in Michigan have found a new dwarf planet in our solar system. It\u2019s about 330 miles across and some 8. 5 billion miles from the sun. It takes 1, 100 years to complete one orbit. But one of the most interesting things about the new object, known for the time being as 2014 UZ224, is the way astronomers found it. David Gerdes of the University of Michigan led the team that found the new dwarf planet. Gerdes describes himself as \u201dan astronomer,\u201d having started his scientific career as a particle physicist.",
        "When I was a kid, I looked to the stars for solace. No matter what was hard or painful or seemed inescapable in my life, I only needed to go out in my backyard at night and tilt my head back. I lived in the congestion of North Jersey, a few miles from Manhattan. That meant my skies were never dark. It didn\u2019t matter, though, the few stars I could see where enough. They reminded me of a truth I really needed back then.",
        "After a video surfaced last week showing Donald Trump boasting in 2005 how he would kiss and grope women without consent, the GOP nominee insisted in Sunday\u2019s presidential debate that it was just \u201dlocker room talk\u201d and, pressed repeatedly by CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, finally said that he had never actually taken the action he described.

        "Throughout his tenure, President Obama has made it clear he has no appetite for involving the United States in another Middle East conflict. Yet the U. S. is bombing daily in Syria and Iraq. And in a separate conflict that\u2019s receiving far less attention, the U. S. is increasingly embroiled in Yemen. Since March 2015, the U. S. has been providing support to a military coalition fighting Houthi rebels. The Houthis ousted Yemen\u2019s government and forced the president, Abed Mansour Hadi, to flee to Saudi Arabia.",
