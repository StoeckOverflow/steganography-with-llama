        "Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush once described as the \u201dcanary in the coal mine\u201d of the Republican Party, saying that if Republicans didn\u2019t make more of an effort to court the racial group in the United States, the party would pay a price at the polls. Now a new report from the National Asian American Survey finds not only that continue a steady drift away from the GOP, but that the party may be losing one of its most reliable ethnic groups. Among registered voters, the survey found Democrat Hillary Clinton had a lead over Republican Donald Trump.",
        "Liberty University is a place where Donald Trump still has a lot of support. But his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, is the one who seems naturally at home at the Virginia college, in a way the flamboyant New York real estate developer is not. Pence spent Wednesday morning campaigning at the school. In his speech, he alluded to Scripture about sin and redemption as he talked about the scandal surrounding his running mate \u2014 the release of a tape where Trump can be heard explicitly boasting about groping women.",
        "Utah has been solidly Republican at the presidential level for the past 48 years. But the leaked tape of Donald Trump bragging about groping and kissing women without their consent may have been the last straw for socially conservative voters in this heavily Mormon state. Soon after the tape surfaced, several prominent Republicans in the state revoked their support for the GOP presidential nominee. Gov. Gary Herbert did so on Twitter within a few hours. Not long after, former Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. and Sen. Mike Lee (who had never endorsed Trump) called on Trump to exit the race.",
        "Comic book fans are familiar with the idea of the multiverse: alternate worlds very similar to ours but different enough for plots to come and go without affecting story arcs. Well, on the where Hillary Clinton is running for president against a traditional, disciplined Republican \u2014 and not a Donald Trump, who has declared civil war on other Republican leaders \u2014 WikiLeaks\u2019 decision to post Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s private emails would be a major, major news story right now.",

        "Last time I worshipped in a synagogue was Sept. 5, 2014. And I won\u2019t be going today. That might surprise my friends, who put up with my bragging ad nauseam about how Jewish I am. You got a great deal on plane tickets? Reminds me of the time I took a free Birthright trip to Israel. Going skating? I haven\u2019t been on skates since my bat mitzvah reception, held at the roller skating rink in Villanova, Pa. You say you love the musicals of George Gershwin?",
        "In his 1936 classic Modern Times, Charlie Chaplin alerts society to the dangers of excessive automation. There is a famous scene where the Little Tramp is put to work on an assembly line and, after tightening screws for a long time, can\u2019t stop repeating the turning motion. The movie\u2019s point is that modern industry is all about efficiency and output, with little concern for the workers. Chaplin saw rapid industrialization turning us into robots, triggering a massive dehumanization of society. Fast forward 80 years.",

        "I was born to a white American mother and a father. His family is Armenian, but lived in Kessab, Syria, before immigrating to Massachusetts. But growing up, I had little contact with his family and culture, including its rich Syrian and Armenian food traditions. His own presence in my life is limited and distorted by his history of violence towards my mother. My biological father\u2019s aggression was explosive. Some of my earliest memories are of him making death threats to my mom and throwing a lamp at her. I remember watching from the hallway, too afraid to intervene.",

        "If you really want to understand a place, writer Colin Dickey has some advice: \u201dIgnore the boastful monuments and landmarks, and go straight to the haunted houses.

        "I was 8 or 9 years old when I moved from a rural town in Oregon to the San Francisco Bay Area. It was one of seven moves my family made during my elementary years. The culture shock of moving from country to city hit me hard. I stuck out at my new school. It was hard to make friends with my new classmates. My parents argued often.
