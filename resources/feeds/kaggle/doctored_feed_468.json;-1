Lynch\u2019s announcement amplifies a statement by FBI Director James Comey at the end of September, when he told a congressional panel that the bureau is in the process of setting up a database that can track police killings and other use of force during interactions with the public.

Princeton University professor and historian Sean Wilentz says that Dylan fits right in with that crowd. Wilentz, the author of the book Bob Dylan In America, joined NPR\u2019s Audie Cornish to discuss the news.",

In 2008, Facebook sued him, saying he was a hacker and a spammer who was putting users at risk.

        "Someone is trying desperately to pull the United States directly into the civil war in Yemen \u2014 and Washington is trying desperately to stay out. U. S. Navy ships off Yemen\u2019s southwestern coast came under missile attacks twice in four days this week, including an incident Wednesday. The U. S. military responded by firing its first public shots into Yemen on Thursday, but the Obama administration was keen to stress that they were acting for their own safety. By firing back, the U. S.",
        "The U. S. launched missiles at three radar installations in areas of Yemen late Wednesday. It\u2019s the first time that the U. S. has carried out strikes against the Houthi rebels during the conflict in Yemen. This comes after missiles were fired from Yemen\u2019s coast at U. S. Navy destroyer USS Mason on two separate occasions in four days.

        "Freedom of religion is enshrined in the U. S. Constitution, but to Dan Meyer, a North Carolina businessman, that does not mean the Founding Fathers were not inspired by God. \u201dMany documents demonstrate that they really received divine guidance in putting together that constitution,\u201d he says. \u201dIt\u2019s not the Bible. It is a document. But most of the writers of that document acknowledged that God gave them guidance and wisdom in putting that document together.\u201d Meyer, 70, recently retired as president of the Chamber of Commerce in the North Carolina mountain town of Boone.",

        "For many of us, simply running a marathon is a serious challenge. But Michal Kapral, a editor from Toronto, had a more difficult goal in mind. He wanted to run a marathon . .. while juggling . .. without dropping a ball even once. And he did it at the Chicago Marathon on Sunday, at the brisk clip of 2 hours and 55 minutes. That\u2019s a pace of about 6:40 per mile. Kapral tells The that he\u2019s an old hand at \u201djoggling\u201d (juggling while jogging, naturally). In fact, this is his eighth joggling marathon.",
        "In the heady political maelstrom of the late 1960s, Italian filmmaker Gillo Pontecorvo released one of the most controversial and acclaimed films of modern cinema. The Battle of Algiers was a recreation of the bloody mid 1950s Algerian uprising against French rule. The film was made on a shoestring budget with recruited from the streets of Algiers. It told the story of an insurrection against colonialism from the rare vantage point of the colonized. That shift in perspective was provocative enough to lead France to ban the film on political grounds. Elsewhere, it opened to rapturous acclaim.",
        "It sounds like a typical melodrama of a movie \u2014 a saga about a big family with issues galore. There\u2019s the widowed grandfather who desperately misses his wife. The sensitive younger son who dreams of being a musician. And the daughter who\u2019s dipping into the family\u2019s stash of cash to pay a con artist who pretends to be a faith healer. But those aren\u2019t the only plotlines in The Yard. The Sudanese film devotes about a third of its running time to the issue of female genital mutilation.",

        "Here\u2019s one image of Thailand: A magnet for Western tourists. One of Asia\u2019s more dynamic economies. The land of smiles. And until Thursday, home of a beloved monarch who united Thais throughout his reign. And here\u2019s another view: A nation where the military ousted an elected government two years ago and suppresses dissent. A country accused of human rights abuses. A land with an authoritarian undercurrent where anyone can be jailed for a negative comment about the royal family. So which one is the real Thailand? Answer: they both are, and often on the same day.",
        "Thailand has a beloved king. The country has had one of the more prosperous economies in Asia. It\u2019s a magnet for Western tourists. Its history is largely peaceful. By most measures, Thailand has been very successful. So why has the country now had a dozen coups, plus many more attempted coups, since it ended its absolute monarchy and became a constitutional monarchy in 1932? The country is so that this week\u2019s military takeover marked the second time in eight years the armed forces have ousted a leader from the same family.",

        "Chun Zheng has lived through a house fire, a flood and an earthquake. None of that, she says, compares to sending her infant daughter and son abroad to live with her extended family. \u201dIt\u2019s the worst hardship I\u2019ve ever had to bear,\u201d says the hotel housekeeper, speaking in Mandarin.

        "It\u2019s easy to read too much into a hit song. Popular music is made that way: Its surface meanings are broad and inclusive, while its idiosyncrasies are vehement, upheld within a startling rhythm or a novel sample or a highly relatable voice. It\u2019s this mix of the familiar and the seemingly unique that allow for pop hits to reach millions of often very different people in ways that feel direct and personal.",
        "Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas was rushed to a hospital last week, underwent urgent cardiac testing and walked out of the hospital hours later \u2014 smiling to TV cameras. \u201dI feel fine,\u201d Abbas, 81, said as he left the hospital with an entourage of officials. But not everyone was at ease. Abbas has a history of health problems. He\u2019s a heavy smoker. Palestinians realize his days in office may be numbered. \u201dWe\u2019re talking months. Not years,\u201d said Nasser of Maan, a Palestinian news agency.",
        "I love Connie Willis\u2019 writing. To Say Nothing of the Dog is one of my favorite books, a comfort read to which I often return sharp, confident, deliciously funny, it seamlessly wove a comedy of manners into a science fictional premise that\u2019s delighted me for years. If I were asked to describe hallmarks of Willis\u2019 work, I\u2019d name her pacing, character work, ear for dialogue and wonderful sense of humor. Crosstalk, unfortunately, is not a great showcase for any of those things.",
        "Note: NPR\u2019s First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the Spotify playlist at the bottom of the page. The guitars fade in, as if to pick up where they left off, or to suggest that they\u2019d never stopped twinkling. \u201dWhere are we now?\u201d Mike Kinsella sings, his voice a little worn, but softened like suede. \u201dWe\u2019re both home alone in the same house Would you even know me if I wasn\u2019t old me?",
        "What lurks beneath? Beneath the water, we find luminescent vampire squid and weighty blue whales. We find hydrothermal chimneys, submarines and scientists who roam the watery terrain in submersibles. Beneath the ground, we find a realm of geysers, volcanoes and tectonic plates. Here also dwell giant earthworms, warthogs and deep roots of wild fig and camel thorn trees. In the subsurface world, humans mine and tunnel and excavate to unleash bones and fossils.",
        "When Jessica Leeds was a traveling paper saleswoman in the late 1970s and early 1980s, she told herself that sexual harassment was just a fact of life. \u201dYou didn\u2019t complain about that sort of thing,\u201d she told NPR in an interview Friday, which will air on All Things Considered. But an encounter she says she had with Donald Trump on a New airplane more than 30 years ago was different.",
        "Scientists are one step closer to understanding a mystery of the Milky Way. In 2007, data showed that a young star about 400 light years away from our solar system was blinking. It was being covered, uncovered and covered again in what astronomers call a \u201dseries of complex eclipses.\u201d The eclipses told astronomers that something was orbiting the young star, and that the something was very large. Eric Mamajek first saw the 2007 data on Dec. 11, 2010, when he was a young professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Rochester.",
        "Counting all the galaxies in the universe is hard. So hard, it seems, that it\u2019s possible to miss billions of them. A new analysis of Hubble Space Telescope data finds there are almost 10 times more galaxies in the universe than we once thought there were \u2014 about 2 trillion of them, up from about 200 billion.",
        "Zeinab Sekaanvand is in jail, awaiting execution. Charged with killing her husband when she was 17, she confessed to the murder but later recanted, saying her committed the crime and pressured her to take responsibility.

But any day now, she could be hanged. Her story begins in a small village in northern Iran.",
        "A Connecticut judge has dismissed a lawsuit that was filed against the manufacturer and seller of the weapon used in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. The dismissal comes months after a judge allowed the case to proceed against Remington Arms, maker of the Bushmaster rifle, as well as the distributor and seller. The families sought damages and relief in their lawsuit, arguing that the weapon that Adam Lanza used to kill 26 people, including 20 children, at Sandy Hook should never have been sold in the civilian marketplace.",
        "Playwright Qui Nguyen usually describes his show, Vietgone, as a \u201dsex comedy\u201d about his parents. He also acknowledges that that\u2019s a strange thing to do. The play does have a lot of sex in it. There are raunchy jokes, and the characters frequently and unabashedly lust after one another and act on those desires. Nguyen said he wanted to make his characters \u2014 fictional Vietnamese refugees based on his parents \u2014 .",
        "For more than two years, the Islamic State has held Mosul, in northern Iraq, in a stranglehold. People who have fled say the militants terrorize people, conduct public executions, recruit children as fighters, forbid communication with the outside world \u2014 all in the name of enforcing a brutal regime they call Islamic. That could now be set to change. Iraq\u2019s security forces and their allies are readying for an assault on the city. The roads to the city are defended and ISIS is expected to fight fiercely, but security officials insist they will take Mosul back soon."
