        "Scientists have discovered a new kind of spidey sense. We already knew that jumping spiders have exceptional vision. We knew that they are great at perceiving vibrations. We even knew that they can \u201dhear\u201d at extremely close range. But in research published in Current Biology, researchers at Cornell University found that a common species of jumping spider called Phidippus audax can actually hear from much farther away than we thought \u2014 at distances of 10 feet away, or more.",
        "The group Swet Shop Boys has only been together a few years, but its members have been individually well known for quite some time.

        "In the latest of a string of rulings on Florida\u2019s death penalty law, the state\u2019s Supreme Court says juries should be unanimous in imposing a death sentence \u2014 something the recently revamped law does not require. In Florida and most other state courts, a jury is required to reach a unanimous verdict \u2014 but perhaps because the size of the jury expands to 12 members in capital criminal cases, legislators opted to require only that 10 out of 12 jurors agree to impose a death sentence when they changed the law earlier this year.",
        "Tower is an animated documentary that tells the story of a massacre that happened 50 years ago and was a historic first: A man with no record of violence shot at people at random for no logical reason. It was Aug. 1, 1966, in the middle of a day at the University of Texas at Austin. The shots came from the clock tower at the center of the campus. A woman eight months pregnant was the first to fall, soon to be followed by her boyfriend and a boy delivering newspapers on his bicycle.",

Conservationists with the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust in Kenya came across Pea two years ago today, while they were rescuing a different infant elephant. The trust is for its rescue and rehabilitation program for orphaned elephants. Pea and her brother, Pod, were brought back to its Nairobi nursery to be raised as part of the elephant herd. Pod eventually struck out on his own, but Pea has remained.",
        "As of Monday, U. S. citizens who travel to Cuba will no longer be limited to bringing back goods worth up to $400 \u2014 including $100 worth of tobacco and alcohol. President Obama ordered the changes, which also clear the way for pharmaceuticals to gain U. S. regulatory approval. Instead of those special quotas, normal limits on Americans\u2019 importation of foreign products for personal use will apply. The changes are meant to \u201dopen up space for Cubans to improve their livelihood,\u201d said a senior White House official who spoke about the changes on background.",
        "On the final day of June 2015, Colin LePage rode waves of hope and despair. It started when LePage found his son, Chris, at home after an apparent overdose. Paramedics rushed Chris by helicopter to one of Boston\u2019s flagship medical centers. Doctors revived Chris\u2019 heart, but struggled to stabilize his temperature and blood pressure. At some point, a doctor or nurse mentioned to LePage that his son had agreed to be an organ donor. \u201dThere was no urgency or, \u2019Hey, you need to do this.\u2019 I could see genuine concern and sadness.\u201d LePage says, his voice quavering.",
        "Note: NPR\u2019s First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the Spotify playlist at the bottom of the page. The first sound Leonard Cohen makes on his new album is a nanosecond\u2019s rush of labored air. It\u2019s not a wheeze, exactly, or a hiccup. But it\u2019s not a singer\u2019s note, either. The singing (such as it is) soon follows, and the \u2019s somber tone signals that matters of grave import are about to be discussed.",
        "Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has extended a with the Marxist FARC rebels until Dec. 31, as he tries to salvage a peace deal that was narrowly rejected in a nationwide referendum. The agreement was intended to end the guerrilla war that has dragged on for more than 50 years and killed more than 220, 000 people, as John Otis reports for NPR from Bogota. He adds: \u201dAfter four years of negotiations, the Colombian government and the rebel group known as the FARC last month signed a peace agreement.",
        "Jin Park remembers where he was when Donald Trump announced his presidential bid in June, 2015. He was alone in his Harvard dorm room and watching Trump on TV. \u201dWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best,\u201d Trump told the crowd at New York\u2019s Trump Tower, \u201dThey\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\u201d Then he proposed a wall along the United States border with Mexico. \u201dI watched that and had this realization that this guy is serious about what he wants to do.",
        "Suppose I take the candy from the cabinet where you left it and put it someplace else. Where will you look for it when you get home? Children younger than 5 will rarely get this right. When questioned, they will say, mistakenly, that you will look for the candy at its new location. They don\u2019t understand that your actions will be controlled by your false belief that the candy is where you left it.",
        "Actress Taraji P. Henson has played a lot of characters in her career, but it took only one role to make her famous: Cookie Lyon, the matriarch of an ambitious, dysfunctional family on the hit TV show Empire. Now Henson has a new memoir out called Around the Way Girl. Don\u2019t know what an \u201daround the way girl\u201d is? Henson explains: \u201dAround the way is like saying from the neighborhood, like from the hood.\u201d Henson still proudly calls herself an around the way girl she says the fame and the money haven\u2019t changed her.",
        "The major university chain DeVry has agreed to stop making its claim: that since 1975, 90 percent of its graduates seeking employment found jobs in their field within six months of graduation. That\u2019s because of a settlement announced Thursday with the Department of Education. In August 2015, the department requested that DeVry prove that claim, which it has used for years in radio, TV, online and print advertisements.",
        "Joe Serna served three tours in Afghanistan as a Green Beret. Judge Lou Olivera is a veteran, too, who served in the Army as an intelligence officer. But when they met, it wasn\u2019t on base. It was in a North Carolina courtroom. Serna had been struggling to adapt to life back home, and, after violating probation on a DWI charge, he was sentenced by Olivera to a night in jail. He would have spent that time in his cell alone with his thoughts, if Olivera hadn\u2019t joined him.",

        "After resisting months of calls from Bernie Sanders and others to release the transcripts of her speeches to Wall Street banks, some of Hillary Clinton\u2019s full remarks are apparently now available for all to see, with just weeks until Election Day. We say \u201dapparently\u201d because the transcripts were published by WikiLeaks as part of its ongoing release of emails hacked from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s personal Gmail account. The Clinton campaign is refusing to verify the authenticity of any of the documents, which it describes as stolen.",

This batch was the eighth installment of what Wikileaks says are Podesta\u2019s emails, and the controversial organization claims to have more than 50, 000 emails in total that they plan to release.",
        "ISIS has held the Iraqi city of Mosul in a tight, brutal grip for more than two years. Now, a motley array of Iraqi forces and their allies are massing to try to retake the extremists\u2019 crown jewel and their largest city. Whether the offensive is successful \u2014 pushing out the militants without the fighting destroying the urban infrastructure or killing large numbers of about 1 million residents \u2014 depends in large part on the shape of ISIS in Mosul.",
        "\u201dThe system\u2019s rigged!\u201d \u201dThe machines will be hacked!\u201d Voters are getting an earful in this campaign. No wonder many are worried whether their ballots will be counted correctly.

        "At some point everyone, regardless of party affiliation or lack thereof, wants to bail from a presidential election. Okay, that\u2019s a hunch, but it\u2019s borne out, at least in part (caveats aplenty) in an online survey by the American Psychological Association. percent of American adults tell the pollsters that the 2016 election is a very or somewhat significant source of stress. The survey was conducted online among adults and older living in the U. S. by Harris Poll for the Association.",
        "This weekend, you might want to take a moment to look up at what promises to be a spectacular supermoon. Added bonus: It\u2019s also a hunter\u2019s moon. \u201dThat\u2019s because in other months, the moon rises about 50 minutes later each day, while the October moon rises just 30 minutes later,\u201d National Geographic explains. \u201dThat offers more light overall during a day, which came in handy for traditional hunters.\u201d Viewing will be at its best on Sunday, when the moon is both full and \u201dat its closest point to our planet as it orbits Earth,\u201d according to NASA.",
        "A coalition warplane bombed a crowded funeral hall in Yemen\u2019s capital Sanaa last week. The airstrikes killed at least 140 people and wounded at least 600, and a Saudi investigation now says they were a result of incorrect information. It was a particularly shocking incident in a conflict that has killed an estimated 4, 000 civilians, where the U. S. coalition has hit marketplaces, hospitals and schools. The coalition supports Yemen\u2019s president and is targeting Shiite Houthi rebels, who control the capital. In the immediate aftermath of the funeral bombing, Saudi Arabia denied any involvement.",
        "Two weeks ago, Hurricane Matthew hit Haiti hard, devastating the southern end of the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. It\u2019s hard to look at the photos coming out of Haiti and not be moved to action. But if you\u2019re thinking now is the time to hop on a plane and get involved in disaster relief work, groups working on the ground have one piece of advice: pump the brakes. \u201dVolunteers without the support of an organization are all gasoline, no car,\u201d says Juanita Rilling, director of USAID\u2019s Center for International Disaster Information.",
        "While we\u2019ve been slogging through what feels like the most contentious presidential election in decades, Canada seems to have been dancing on air, still caught up in the glow of a relatively new prime minister who has been compared to a Disney prince.

Enter Canada, with a small, yet poignant show of support during our year of discontent.",
        "Bob Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature this week. His selection was surprising. He is the first artist to receive the award for a body of work that is almost entirely songs.

        "It\u2019s tough to think of a major honor that hasn\u2019t been bestowed on Bob Dylan in his long career, but Thursday brought a new addition to his crowded awards shelf: the Nobel Prize for Literature.
