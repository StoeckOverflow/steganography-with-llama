        "Digital gizmos can monitor your every foot The question is whether they\u2019re going to do your heart any good. The short answer: It depends. One thing to consider is whether the device is a consumer fitness monitor for tracking heart rate, or if it\u2019s a medical device approved by the Food and Drug Administration for detecting potentially dangerous heart rhythm irregularities. First, the fitness monitors.",
        "Remember for a moment the days of your youth. Before you were a reader of Serious Literature. Before you cared about the big questions and thematic duality, Pynchon\u2019s latest or the spectacular weirdness of China Mieville. Bring to mind a simpler time when books existed either as pure, entertainment or (depending on your age) as a vehicle for Dick and Jane to teach you about manners or Ninja Turtles to school you on good oral hygiene. When we were young, curious monkeys got to go to space and talking bears taught us about friendship and the lifestyle.",

        "Expressing political beliefs with a yard sign is common. But business owners can hurt their bottom lines by advertising an opinion. Political scientists and marketing experts generally advise against doing that, as we first reported during the 2012 election. Despite the advice, some business owners are willing to risk a financial hit, depending on whether their customers agree with them. The Philadelphia suburbs are swing territory during elections, so you won\u2019t find many signs in shop windows there. Owners don\u2019t want to risk alienating up to half their customer base. But in rural Pennsylvania? No problem.",
        "Miranda Sings is an awkward, homeschooled teenager with messy hair, mismatched outfits and clownish red lipstick that ends up smeared all over her teeth. From her bedroom, she uploads videos of herself singing \u2014 horrifically badly \u2014 that she believes will make her a star. And they have. Around 7 million people follow her on YouTube. Now, thanks to Netflix, Miranda is getting her own TV show. The streaming service successfully courted comedian Colleen Ballinger, who came up with Miranda back in 2009.",
        "About of all the food produced globally is either lost or wasted. Pests and infections destroy fruits and vegetables. Grains often rot in storage or during transport. And then there\u2019s food in consumers\u2019 kitchens and refrigerators that doesn\u2019t get eaten, and eventually discarded. Such losses amount to more than $900 billion globally, according to the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization. Reducing this wastage could save money and help meet the world\u2019s growing demand for food. And people are finally starting to try and do this \u201d we\u2019ve reported before on a number of such efforts here in the USA.",

        "Donald Trump has been raising doubts about the integrity of the election for months, but his running mate and other GOP leaders are taking a more cautious tone. \u201dWe will absolutely accept the result of the election,\u201d Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence said on NBC\u2019s Meet The Press Sunday. \u201dLook, the American people will speak in an election that will culminate on November the 8th.",
        "This spring, The New York Times prefaced the onslaught of festival season by publishing an unusually transparent editorial memo. As music festivals are so plentiful and so often indistinguishable, they would no longer be covering the likes of Coachella and Lollapalooza by default. Instead, their attentions would turn to the smaller, stranger events, the ones that told a unique story. In the former East Berlin in the last week of September, artists minted a new, nameless festival that figured out the story it wanted to tell as it went along.",
        "Neither at war nor fully at peace, Marxist rebels in southern Colombia who want to lay down their weapons are instead killing time and contemplating whether they will be called back into combat. It\u2019s a surreal state of affairs, brought on by a stalemate over an agreement to end Colombia\u2019s guerrilla war. The accord was signed last month but then rejected by Colombian voters in a binding referendum on Oct. 2. Now, the entire peace process is on hold, leaving thousands of guerrillas in limbo.",
        "If you thought Congress was done probing Hillary Clinton\u2019s email scandal, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, of Utah, has some news for you. The Republican chair of the House Oversight committee told Fox News that new evidence turned over by the FBI pointed to a \u201dquid pro quo\u201d arrangement between the FBI and the State Department and that was grounds for at least \u201dfour new hearings\u201d after Congress comes back from recess. \u201dThis is a flashing red light of potential criminality,\u201d Chaffetz said.",
        "Many countries think of TB as a disease of the past and this lack of awareness results in shortfalls in funding and a lack of political will to aggressively combat the disease. But a new WHO report on tuberculosis published this week makes it very clear that TB is a disease of the present. An estimated 10. 4 million people were infected in 2015, an increase over previous years. Some 1. 8 million died from the disease, or more than 34, 000 people a week on average far more than Ebola ever claimed.",

        "\u201dNo man is an island, entire of itself,\u201d John Donne famously reassured us in 1623, the same year Shakespeare\u2019s The Tempest was published in the First Folio. But \u201disolate\u201d and \u201disland\u201d come from the same Latin root, and the truth is that we make our own islands where we daily maroon ourselves.

        "Bicycles are a type of vehicle so they belong on the road, right? This is how the wheels turn in places such as New York City and San Francisco, where bicyclists older than age 13 are banned from riding on the sidewalk. Similar laws exist in many cities and towns throughout the country, such as Columbus, Ohio, and Chapel Hill, N. C. That\u2019s not the case everywhere, though. In Boston and Washington, D.

        "Law enforcement is increasingly worried about losing access to powerful tools for searching social media because of changing attitudes at the social media companies that allow the searches.

        "Even after Nov. 8, no matter who is elected, many don\u2019t expect the partisan infighting that has highlighted this year\u2019s unusually ugly campaign to come to an end. But in an interview with NPR\u2019s Robert Siegel, Vice President Biden struck a hopeful tone, saying that Hillary Clinton and Democrats could be effective if she wins the presidency. \u201dI think when we appeal to the better angels of Americans, we\u2019ve always succeeded.

        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails are making headlines again, this time with the release of documents from the FBI\u2019s investigation into her use of a private email server while secretary of state.

        "The Clinton Foundation and the Trump Foundation have names. And they\u2019ve both become political targets in this election cycle. Beyond that, charities experts say, they have remarkably little in common.

But a national shortage of medical specialists and inpatient facilities means that many still go untreated \u2014 despite national efforts to improve mental health care.
