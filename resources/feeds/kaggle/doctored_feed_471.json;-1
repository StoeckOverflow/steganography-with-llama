        "The Islamic State forced the world to take notice when the extremist group overran Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, in June 2014. Just months earlier, President Obama had described ISIS as \u201dthe JV team.\u201d But by August 2014, the U. S. was bombing ISIS in Iraq, and early Monday, the U. S. teamed up with the Iraqi army and other allies in a major offensive to recapture the northern Iraqi city.",
        "The Iraqi military offensive to retake Mosul from ISIS has begun. Backed by U. S. air support, Iraqi army troops and allied Kurdish fighters are advancing on the city from two fronts, the south and northeast, as NPR\u2019s Alice Fordham tells Morning Edition. They say they\u2019re making progress but face resistance from ISIS militants who have been in control of the area for more than two years. The battle could be a watershed moment in the fight against the Islamic State.",

In a plan released today, Pepsi says that by the year 2025 at least of the drinks in its global beverage portfolio are expected to contain 100 calories or fewer from added sugar per serving.

There will also be \u201dincreased focus on zero and products\u201d according to the company\u2019s statement. \u201dI think Pepsi\u2019s announcement is a very meaningful commitment,\u201d Dr.",
        "A Florida judge has sentenced a man who shot at George Zimmerman during a confrontation to 20 years in prison. Zimmerman fatally shot unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida in 2012 in a case that struck a chord nationwide. He was later acquitted of all charges. \u201dA jury in Florida\u2019s Seminole County found Matthew Apperson guilty of attempted murder in the shooting \u2014 which happened as Apperson and Zimmerman were driving in separate vehicles,\u201d NPR\u2019s Greg Allen tells our Newscast unit.

        "Thirteen years ago, just as the United States began what was to become its longest war, a futuristic wheelchair hit the market. The iBOT allowed paralyzed people, including many veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, to stand up by rising to eye level. It also did something no wheelchair ever had: climb stairs. But even though users loved it, the iBOT went out of production in 2009 when Johnson Johnson discontinued it. \u201dI was very disappointed,\u201d says disabled veteran Gary Linfoot, a former Army helicopter pilot.",
        "A newly released report describes disintegrating mental health among dozens of the more than 1, 100 people being held by Australia on the Pacific island nation of Nauru. The report out Monday from Amnesty International is based largely on interviews conducted by Anna Neistat, a researcher working for the watchdog group, in July with 58 people being held on the island. It focuses on calling it \u201dshockingly commonplace.\u201d One man told Neistat, who previously spoke to NPR about her time in Nauru, that he had taken actions to kill himself twice in 10 weeks.",
        "How do you write a memoir if you don\u2019t trust your memory? That\u2019s the question at the heart of Mark Slouka\u2019s new memoir, Nobody\u2019s Son. It covers his childhood in Pennsylvania, and the lives of his Czech parents \u2014 through World War II, the Soviet regime that followed, and their immigration to America. And as Slouka jumps across the last 60 years, he circles back on himself \u2014 he\u2019ll tell a story, and then a chapter or two later it emerges that events weren\u2019t quite as he described.",
        "Last summer, I went on Morning Edition to talk about the quest for a tomato. And at the very end of the conversation, I confidently declared that no one should ever put tomatoes in the refrigerator. It kills the taste, I said. That\u2019s what I\u2019d heard from scientists and tomato growers alike. Afterwards, I heard from several friends. It seems I\u2019d taken sides in a domestic dispute that has long divided husbands and wives. Someone on Twitter also pointed out a blog post that seemed to contradict my statement. I\u2019ll say more about that later.",
        "Parents\u2019 views of child care are a little like life in Lake Wobegon \u2014 the vast majority say it\u2019s way above average.

        "Americans can watch a documentary about China that\u2019s not yet been officially shown in mainland China because of its subject matter. Hooligan Sparrow is about six schoolgirls, ages 11 to 14, who in 2013 were allegedly taken by their principal to a hotel in another town, where he and another man sexually assaulted them.

        "Even if you don\u2019t know his name, you know Vangelis. He won an Academy Award for his original score for Chariots Of Fire, a film remembered as much for its music as anything else. He went on to compose the original scores for Blade Runner and Carl Sagan\u2019s PBS series Cosmos. His music has often been described as \u201dspacey,\u201d and his new album, Rosetta, uses his trademark synthesizers to tell a story set in outer space.

        "If you feel like Internet ads are more pervasive and invasive than ever before, you\u2019re not alone. Author Tim Wu tells Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross that the Web has gotten worse over the years, not better \u2014 and unrelenting ads are to blame. \u201dI think you spend 50 percent of your mental energy trying to defeat ad systems,\u201d Wu says.",
        "Updated at 9:30 a. m. ET on Oct. 18, The activist organization WikiLeaks says the Internet connection for its founder, Julian Assange, has been severed by what it called a \u201dstate party.\u201d The accusation came in a tweet early Monday. A subsequent tweet accused Ecuador of cutting off Assange\u2019s Internet access. The WikiLeaks founder has been living at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London for more than four years. As The has reported, Assange sought refuge there after Sweden issued a warrant for his arrest to question him over allegations of sex crimes.",
        "Earlier this year, Billy Bragg and Joe Henry set off on a journey. They boarded a train in Chicago, bound for Los Angeles. Each time the train stopped for more than 20 minutes in cities like St. Louis and San Antonio, they\u2019d grab their guitars, hop off, find the waiting room and record an old railroad song. The result of this journey is an album called Shine A Light: Field Recordings From The Great American Railroad. Bragg has been weaving folk and punk with protest music since the late \u201970s, when he first started busking around London.",
        "The governing body for men\u2019s tennis has suspended Australian star Nick Kyrgios for three months, or eight tournament weeks, after he essentially threw his match last week at the Shanghai Masters. Kyrgios often appeared uninterested during the match against German player Mischa Sverev, lobbing soft, slow serves over the net and wandering away before Sverev could return them. He bickered with the umpire and a fan during the match, and was quickly defeated at and .",
        "Rodents are generally the last things most restaurant owners want in their kitchen. But in the larger cities of Peru, chefs are practically fighting over guinea pigs in a restaurant craze that is bringing financial stability \u2014 if not exactly wealth \u2014 to small farmers in the Andes Mountains. People have eaten this furry rodent for centuries in the high country of Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. Called cuyes in Spanish, guinea pigs were traditionally fried or grilled and eaten for special or boiled into a stew and served to the ill or injured as a sort of tonic.",
        "You may best know the guinea pig as a nervous little pet that lives in a cage and eats alfalfa pellets. Now, the rodents are increasingly showing up on plates in the United States. South American restaurants on both coasts seem to be pushing the trend, answering to demand mostly from Andean expats for what is considered a fine and valuable food in Ecuador, Peru and Colombia. foodies with a taste for exotic delicacies are also ordering, photographing and blogging about guinea pig.",
        "The high school graduation rate in the U. S. reached an high of 83 percent in the school year, President Obama announced today, marking the fifth straight year. Achievement gaps have narrowed even as all boats have risen. Graduation rates range from 90 percent for students who identify as Islanders to 64 percent for students with disabilities.

        "Let\u2019s make one thing clear: Three weeks out from this election, Hillary Clinton is winning \u2014 and it\u2019s not close. Yes, people still have to vote, but if Democratic groups come out \u2014 and the Trump campaign is more like a white flag than an actual strategy \u2014 Hillary Clinton will be the next president of the United States unless something drastic changes between now and Election Day. The month of October has been about as bad as could be for Trump. Let\u2019s recap.",
        "How would Donald Trump \u201ddrain the swamp\u201d in Washington as he puts it? Two words: term limits. At a rally in Colorado Springs, Colo. Tuesday, Trump said if elected in November he will \u201dpush for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.\u201d Trump did not elaborate on how many terms lawmakers could serve. The idea of capping how long lawmakers can spend in Washington is popular with many in the GOP and has been proposed before, most notably as part of the Republicans\u2019 \u201dContract with America\u201d in 1994.",
        "This election has been particularly noisy. But when all the Twitter storms and heated exchanges (maybe) fade away after Nov. 8, the issues that affect real voters will remain. With that in mind, we set out to create a cheat sheet on where each candidate stands on the issues voters care about most. The issues we chose to highlight come from the top 10 issues voters said were \u201dvery important\u201d to their vote, according to a 2016 poll from the Pew Research Center.",
        "Stargazers, ready your telescopes: An unusual lunar event is going to be visible across large portions of the U. S. It\u2019s called an \u201doccultation,\u201d in which the waning gibbous moon will pass over the huge, bright orange star of Aldebaran. We thought the phenomenon\u2019s spooky name might be just the thing to get geared up for Halloween. The event will be visible across large portions of the South and the Northeastern United States, Mexico, the Caribbean and parts of Canada.",
        "Ecuador acknowledges it restricted the Internet access of Julian Assange, who has lived at the country\u2019s London embassy for more than four years.

        "Nobody loves pesticides, exactly. But one kind of pesticide, called neonicotinoids, is provoking a particularly bitter debate right now between environmentalists and farmers. The chemicals are highly toxic to bees. Some scientists think they are partly to blame for the decline in pollinators. For the past year, the province of Ontario, in Canada, has responded to the controversy with a novel experiment. Ontario\u2019s government is asking farmers to prove that they actually need neonicotinoids, often called neonics. It turns out that \u201dneed\u201d is a word that\u2019s hard to define.",
        "Traditionally, candidates do not complain about an election being rigged until they have actually lost. But 2016 is not a traditional year, and Donald Trump is no traditional candidate.

        "On Election Day this November, about 1 in 4 Americans will vote using a device that never lets the voter see a copy of his or her vote on paper. The idea of relying on such machines has troubled some security experts for years. And this year the stakes may be even higher, because one candidate is charging that the election is rigged, and government officials have warned that state election systems have been targeted by foreign hackers with ties to Russia.",
        "Donald Trump is warning that the election will be rigged. He has precisely zero evidence to back up that claim. But he has a remarkably receptive audience. Around 30 percent of Americans have \u201dlittle or no confidence\u201d that votes will be counted accurately \u2014 and Trump\u2019s voters are far less confident about that than Clinton\u2019s. That means that potentially millions of Americans will turn out to vote on Nov. 8, despite apparently believing their votes may not count at all. But to believe the election will be \u201drigged\u201d is to believe that any number of improbable things will happen.",
        "President Obama had some harsh words for Donald Trump\u2019s charges that the presidential election is going to be rigged \u2014 \u201dStop whining.\u201d With the GOP nominee trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the polls, Trump has turned to claiming that if he loses, the election is rigged.",
