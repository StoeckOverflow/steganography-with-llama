        "Chuck Berry turns 90 Tuesday. I know he\u2019s a very important person in music history, but he\u2019s never been a guy I listened to much. I mean, I\u2019ve heard hits like \u201dMaybellene\u201d from 1955, but I wanted to learn more. So I called Tony Trov. He\u2019s an artist out of Philadelphia, but more important, he plays in a Chuck Berry cover band called It\u2019s Marvin, Your Cousin Marvin Berry, a reference to a memorable scene in Back to the Future. Trov couldn\u2019t comprehend how I wasn\u2019t a fan. \u201dI dunno, are you a communist?\u201d he asks me.",
        "Today, Chuck Berry turns 90. And today, the man who helped define rock \u2019n\u2019 roll celebrates by announcing his first album in 38 years.

        "What\u2019s striking about all the controversial police videos we\u2019ve covered is how different they can look to people, depending on their backgrounds. If you\u2019re a police officer, certain things might stand out, while if you\u2019re a civilian or you\u2019ve been arrested by a police officer, other things might catch your attention. So we thought we\u2019d try something new, using a video brought to our attention by member station WFDD in the Triad region of North Carolina. The recordings come from the body cameras of two officers as they make a routine call \u2014 which then goes bad.",
        "Pedals, New Jersey\u2019s beloved black bear, appears to have been a casualty of this year\u2019s bear hunt. The wild animal had been captured on film ambulating in a distinctly human fashion \u2014 hence his name, short for \u201dbipedal.\u201d Pedals had a visible disability in his front forepaws, though he appeared to be in good health surviving in the wild.

He uses careful English and tries to stop his voice from trembling as he speaks about the Iraqi city he lived in all his life. \u201dMy mind is full with memories,\u201d he says. \u201dFriends. Home. You know \u2014 my home. I was born there.\u201d ISIS has occupied Mosul for more than two years. Residents describe a regime of strict rules and savagely violent punishments for breaking them.

It has been a week since Samsung pulled the plug on what had been slated to be its flagship smartphone. Samsung began recalling the devices for posing a fire hazard a month and a half ago.

        "It\u2019s the most pressing problem, but phones aren\u2019t the only challenge facing the world\u2019s leading seller of mobile phones.

In South Korea, Samsung\u2019s next moves matter. That South Koreans call their country the \u201dRepublic of Samsung\u201d is no exaggeration. The conglomerate\u2019s electronics are known around the world, but in Seoul, Samsung is also behind everything from baked goods to to life insurance.",

The prosecutor for one trial was Benjamin Ferencz, who was just 27 at the time, and it was his first trial.",

She contrasted their records: While she was in the Situation Room getting bin Laden, Trump, she said, was on Celebrity Apprentice. Here are the six   moments:",
        "During the final presidential debate, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump clashed over Russia. Responding to a question about one of her speeches released by WikiLeaks, Clinton pivoted by saying Trump should disavow Russia. Trump responded by saying it would not be a bad thing if Russia and the United States got along and that Russian President Vladimir Putin has no respect for Clinton. \u201dThat\u2019s because he\u2019d rather have a puppet as president,\u201d Clinton replied, sparking one of the fiercest confrontations during the debate thus far.
