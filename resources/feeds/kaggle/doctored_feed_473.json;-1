        "This year\u2019s presidential election will be the first in a without the significant presence of federal observers at polling places. That\u2019s because in 2013 the U. S. Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, and when the court wiped out that section, the statute that provided for election observers went, too. The landmark decision in Shelby County v. Holder doesn\u2019t mean civil rights officials are totally disarmed. The Justice Department will still send out \u201dhundreds\u201d of \u201dmonitors\u201d to oversee Election Day compliance.",

The real estate market in Havana, Cuba, is roaring. The communist country is seeing its mansions and Art Deco apartments selling in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

        "Donald Trump at Wednesday\u2019s presidential debate refused to say whether he would honor the results of the Nov. 8 election. But is that just a tease meant to build suspense?

        "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump had one job in his third and final debate with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton: break out. He needed to break out from the narrative that is fast enveloping his campaign \u2014 the way evening overtakes the late afternoon.

Catalan lawmakers approved the ban in 2010, citing animal cruelty.

        "Tens of millions of Americans gathered around TV sets to watch the debate last night. But how they thought it went may depend upon which networks they watched.

What\u2019s more, they say the \u201dmolecular machinery\u201d for leg development still persists in snakes after these millions of years \u2014 it\u2019s simply switched off. Some snakes, such as pythons, retain tiny vestiges of legs in the form of two small bumps on either side of their pelvis."
