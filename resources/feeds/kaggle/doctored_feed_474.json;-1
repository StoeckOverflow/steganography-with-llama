        "Updated at 7:30 p. m. ET, Hackers attacked a major Internet infrastructure company Friday, causing intermittent disruptions to websites and services including Twitter, Amazon, Spotify and Airbnb most of the day. It wasn\u2019t until shortly after 6 p. m. ET, that the company said that the \u201dincident\u201d had been resolved. Friday\u2019s disruptions were the result of a massive DDoS, or \u201ddistributed denial of service,\u201d attack. That\u2019s when hackers overwhelm a website with fake traffic to cause breakdowns. Except in this case, it wasn\u2019t just one website. The victim of the attack is a company called Dyn (pronounced \u201ddine\u201d).",
        "Cybersecurity has plagued this presidential election like no other in U. S. history. Earlier this week, the Obama administration indicated its plans to retaliate against Russia, in some way, for cyberattacks. Hacking came up, again, in the final presidential debate. Yet neither candidate is offering a roadmap for what to do on aggression, or how to handle foreign hackers. Let\u2019s revisit the last debate. Hillary Clinton brings up hacking. She says the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans, feeding Wikileaks.",
        "New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie knew about a road study that would create a traffic nightmare \u2014 and used the advance notice to ask about his office\u2019s relationship with the local mayor, former top aide Bridget Kelly testified in court Friday. Kelly also said that Christie had cursed and thrown a water bottle at her. Kelly is on trial on federal charges that range from conspiracy to wire fraud.",
        "A federal judge has decided that Harold T. Martin III, a former National Security Agency contractor accused of stealing classified government documents and property, should be detained pending trial. The judge found that Martin \u201dis a serious risk to the public\u201d and presents a flight risk, as NPR\u2019s Carrie Johnson reports from the federal courthouse in Baltimore. Here\u2019s more from Carrie: \u201dAuthorities have presented no evidence Martin shared the materials with a foreign power or anyone else.",
        "Instead of drifting gently onto Mars\u2019 surface, the Schiaparelli Mars lander hit the planet hard \u2014 and possibly exploded. That\u2019s the word from the European Space Agency, which says new images taken by NASA show the possible crash site. The NASA images, taken on Oct. 20, show two recent changes to the landscape on Mars\u2019 surface \u2014 one dark blotch, and one white speck \u2014 which are being interpreted as Schiaparelli\u2019s parachute and its crash site.",
        "Florida is one of the most racially diverse battleground states, and the political geography of the Sunshine State \u2014 pockets of blue dotted along a long central strip of red \u2014 means its 29 electoral votes are a prize. Immigration is the leading issue for many Hispanic voters in Florida in 2016, after Donald Trump made building a wall on the Southern border a central issue of his campaign. Economics matters a great deal to Florida voters, too, many of whom are still struggling to recover from the financial and housing crisis of eight years ago.",
        "This post was updated on Oct. 24 to reflect additional perspectives on the history of U. S. economic growth, Should the United States aspire to the kind of economic growth China and India enjoy? That\u2019s what Donald Trump seemed to say at the Oct. 19 presidential debate: \u201dI just left some high representatives in India. They\u2019re growing at 8 percent. China is growing at 7 percent, and that for them is a catastrophically low number. We are growing, our last report came out, it\u2019s right over from the 1 percent level.",
        "Former Wells Fargo employees tell NPR that managers at the bank retaliated against them for calling the company\u2019s ethics line and pushing back against reckless sales practices. They say the bank fired them or pushed them to resign and then, in effect, put a scarlet letter on their permanent record that has damaged their careers and prevented them from getting hired by other banks. Jeremy worked in a Wells Fargo branch in Los Angeles starting in 2005.",
        "ISIS fighters launched attacks on police Friday in the city of Kirkuk, as Iraqi security forces continued a massive military offensive to try to pry Mosul, one of Iraq\u2019s largest cities, from the militant group. \u201dThe fighters struck [Kirkuk] before dawn, with suicide bombers hitting four police stations and gunmen killing police,\u201d NPR\u2019s Alice Fordham reports from Irbil, Iraq, though the number of casualties wasn\u2019t immediately clear. \u201dA curfew is imposed in Kirkuk, but eyewitnesses say fighting continues.\u201d The militants also hit an electricity station outside the city, Alice says.",
        "To find Mosul\u2019s cops, you drive to a gray dot of a village in an endless desert. The village, Mahana, was retaken from the Islamic State a few months ago and for now it\u2019s the police base for cops who left Mosul when ISIS took over more than two years ago. Iraq\u2019s army and its allies are now battling their way through rural areas toward the larger prize of retaking Mosul. Helicopters buzz back and forth from the front lines. Every breath is bitter with smoke from oil wells set alight by ISIS.",
        "Updated 7 p. m. ET with the replacement head being removed, The CBC reports that an substitute for a stolen head of Jesus has itself now been removed from a statue. The church\u2019s priest said the replacement had to go because it was damaging the original statue. But while the temporary head was in place, it inspired lots of joy on the Internet. Our original post: In this one, very particular, instance, maybe baby Jesus was better off headless.",
        "It will be a night of tension and hope for baseball fans in Chicago when the Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers play Game 6 of the National League Championship Series on Saturday. If the Cubs win, they will move on to the World Series to face the American League champion Cleveland Indians. It will be a step closer to fulfilling a wish of a faithful fan, Virginia Wood. Wearing a Cubs and surrounded by family, Wood was ready for baseball Thursday night when the Cubs and Dodgers took to the field.",
        "The 2016 finalists for the second annual Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards have been announced, and they are predictably delightful. A grinning owl. A fish slapping a bear in the face. An unfortunate interaction between a buffalo and a bird. At least two eagles with very little dignity. Click through the slideshow for a selection of the finalists. The Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards were established last year by a wildlife conservation organization.",
        "There are roughly 21 funerals a day at Arlington National Cemetery. The majority are simple graveside burials. But for those soldiers who have earned \u201dfull honors,\u201d the casket is brought to the grave by a team of horses pulling a caisson. These horses are the subject of a new series of portraits by Dutch photographer Charlotte Dumas now on view at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D. C. The horses seem sad, and Dumas says that\u2019s what drives her work. \u201dI do think that portraits of animals, specifically, give room for reflection of one\u2019s own emotions.",
        "It was tense even before they started. Reporters tweeted that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump entered the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner from separate sides of the room, and didn\u2019t even shake hands (which at this point really isn\u2019t a surprise). But there was hope that Thursday night\u2019s event could serve as a comedic salve for the nation following three decidedly nasty presidential debates. The fundraising event for Catholic charities \u2014 now in its 71st year \u2014 traditionally is a time for the candidates to offer jokes about themselves and their opponent.",
        "Last week, in this space, we looked at fascinating evidence of deep and sameness when it comes to humans and our great ape cousins. They, like us, are attuned not only to what those around them are doing but to why they are doing it. They appreciate, as do we, that what others do flows from what they know or believe about what is going around around them, as well as from what they want. (See Barbara J. King\u2019s piece Thursday for more exploration of our mental kinship with chimpanzees.) Today\u2019s topic is difference, not sameness.",
        "Sunday is the 10th anniversary of My Chemical Romance\u2019s The Black Parade, a defining album for both the band and a generation of fans. A decade later, NPR\u2019s Daoud is still processing what it means to love this record, and what its impact says about the culture around it.

        "If there\u2019s one rule that most parents cling to in the confusing, world of kids and media, it\u2019s this one: No screens before age 2. As of today, that rule is out the window. The American Academy of Pediatrics, which first issued that recommendation back in 1999, has extensively updated and revised its guidelines for children and adolescents to reflect new research and new habits. The new guidelines, especially for very young children, shift the focus from WHAT is on the screen to WHO else is in the room.",

        "South Africa has decided to withdraw from the International Criminal Court, after previously ignoring an ICC arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar . Reuters and The Associated Press both say they have seen a document, signed by South Africa\u2019s foreign minister, declaring the country\u2019s intent to withdraw. The AP reports that legislation to finalize the move has to pass South Africa\u2019s parliament, but notes that passage of such a bill is likely. Just days ago, Burundi became the first country ever to withdraw from the ICC.",
        "When Rosley Espinoza\u2019s daughter was very young, in preschool, she started acting differently. She seemed distracted and would get in trouble at school. \u201dLack of interest, teachers\u2019 notes coming home with behavior notes,\u201d Espinoza says, speaking in Spanish. She says she asked school officials to evaluate her daughter, Citlali, for special education, but they didn\u2019t. Every year, Espinoza says, Citlali\u2019s behavior got worse.

        "On this week\u2019s +1 podcast: A conversation with Henry Hey, the orchestrator, arranger and musical director for Lazarus, the musical set to the songs of David Bowie. Lazarus only ran in New York for six weeks last winter, and the songs weren\u2019t available for anyone to hear outside of those live performances until this week, when Columbia Records released the cast recording of Lazarus, along with three new songs Bowie wrote and recorded for the musical. The tracks, written during his Blackstar sessions, were among the final recordings Bowie made before he died of liver cancer on Jan. 10.",
        "While political Washington is in a tizzy about the election and what it portends for the Supreme Court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is prepping for her operatic debut in Italian composer Gaetano Donizetti\u2019s \u201dThe Daughter of the Regiment.\u201d For one night in November, the diminutive legal diva will play the nonsinging role of the Duchess of Krakenthorp, a character akin to the dowagers in Marx Brothers movies.

        "The NFL\u2019s New York Giants are heading to London for a game against the Los Angeles Rams this Sunday, without their kicker Josh Brown. The decision to leave Brown behind comes after new information emerged in a domestic violence case. And suddenly, there are new questions about whether the league adheres to its supposedly tougher policy against domestic violence. In May 2015, Brown was arrested for assaulting his Molly at their home in Washington state. Brown wasn\u2019t charged. The league conducted its own investigation to determine whether Brown had violated the NFL\u2019s Personal Conduct Policy.",
        "\u201dI am lost, I confess, in the age of the social,\u201d Lady Gaga intones in her saddest alto in \u201dAngel Down,\u201d the anthem that concludes her fifth studio album, Joanne, officially released today. It\u2019s a strange disclosure from a pop star whose entire career has seemingly played upon the practice of inhabiting constructed online identities to escape reality, earn a lover\u2019s affections or scam a path toward success. Gaga crashed the Top 40 in 2008 with The Fame, an examination of the risks and limits of democratized glamor written in cool club bangers.",
        "A group of teenage girls in school uniforms giggle as they share crepes topped with candy and chocolate sauce and oozing hazelnut Nutella. It\u2019s a Saturday afternoon and the girls are at the new Nutella shop in Jerusalem\u2019s Shuafat Palestinian refugee camp. The scene is rare in this densely populated and impoverished urban camp. The potholed street outside the caf\u00e9 is tense and crowded, as a group of little Palestinian schoolboys fight alongside zigzagging traffic. But inside the shop, it\u2019s bright and quiet. The d\u00e9cor is an ode to Nutella, with a localized twist.",
        "Make no mistake. Gloria Steinem, noted feminist and author, does not see that a woman elected to the White House automatically means a win for feminists or women. \u201dThis is not all about biology, and I think we have to be careful to always say that, because if Sarah Palin were the president it wouldn\u2019t signify change,\u201d she tells NPR\u2019s Steve Inskeep. \u201dIf President Obama did not represent the majority views of Americans and of he would not represent change as he does. So it isn\u2019t about simple biology.",

A recent arrival from the Dominican Republic, Tabinda had just taken a job as a housekeeper at a New York City hotel \u2014 the very same hotel where Tariq worked at the hotel\u2019s front desk.

        "It\u2019s time to talk about ballot measures. Or rather, those other things voters are deciding on Nov. 8. This November, there are 156 measures being voted on in 35 states and the District of Columbia. California is in the lead, with a whopping 17 measures on its ballot. Although these ballot measures are voted on state by state, there are some big national themes. With nine states voting on it, the most popular ballot measure topic this year is marijuana. Some states are asking voters whether to legalize it for recreational use, others for medicinal use."
