        "The church of San Lorenzo in Accumoli is tiny and dark. The electricity has been out since a powerful earthquake ripped through the area and killed nearly 300 people less than two months ago. It also knocked over three rows of pews on the church\u2019s wooden floor, soggy since parts of the foundation receded. \u201dDon\u2019t step over there, you could fall through,\u201d warns Silvio Santi, the church caretaker.

        "A version of this story also appeared on Alaska Public Radio. Every year, the U. S. military moves hundreds of thousands of service members and their families all across the globe. In 2014, the Defense Department spent more than $4. 3 billion on moving costs, but officials don\u2019t know where all that money is going. Lt. Col. Alan Brown and his family are among the many that have had to move over and over again for his military career.",
        "Every day in the United States, millions of expectant mothers take a prenatal vitamin on the advice of their doctor. The counsel typically comes with physical health in mind: folic acid to help avoid fetal spinal cord problems iodine to spur healthy brain development calcium to be bound like molecular Legos into diminutive baby bones. But what about a child\u2019s future mental health? Questions about whether ADHD might arise a few years down the road or whether schizophrenia could crop up in young adulthood tend to be overshadowed by more immediate parental anxieties.",
        "The program seemed like a fantastic idea at first, says Manoj Mohanan, an assistant professor of public policy and economics at Duke University. It\u2019s called the Program. The idea behind it was to transform health care in rural India, where doctors are scarce. WHP hoped to set up franchises where patients could get electronic advice from doctors with degrees instead of health workers. The program got a lot of support, including $23 million in funding from the Gates Foundation (which is a funder of NPR and of this blog).",

        "The Great Recession technically ended in June of 2009, but many of America\u2019s schools are still feeling the pinch. A new study of state budget documents and Census Bureau data finds that the lion\u2019s share of spending on schools in at least 23 states will be lower this school year than it was when the recession began nearly a decade ago. This analysis looked specifically at what\u2019s called general formula funding, which accounts for roughly 70 percent of the money states spend in their schools.",
        "Stars Hollow, the picturesque setting of the TV show The Gilmore Girls is practically a character of its own. (sometimes to a fault) the fictional New England town is filled with lovable oddballs who gossip over coffee, bicker at town meetings, and make viewers wonder if there\u2019s anything remotely like it in the real world. The answer is . .. sort of. Stars Hollow is based on a real New England town \u2014 Washington, Conn. \u2014 where show creator Amy hatched the idea during a weekend stay.",

        "The final presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton wrapped up last week, but a argument raged for days afterward: Is Trump saying \u201dbigly\u201d or \u201d \u201d? Many took to social media questioning what the Republican nominee could be saying. Some even criticized him, saying bigly isn\u2019t a word. But it turns out bigly is a word, says lexicographer and editor Kory Stamper. \u201dBigly is, in fact, an adverb,\u201d she says. \u201dIt\u2019s just a really rare adverb that doesn\u2019t have much use today.\u201d Bigly\u2019s meaning has also changed through the years.",
        "In most cases, when an employer pays a signing bonus to attract new workers, that payment is understood to be essentially unrecoverable. But the Pentagon has a different understanding \u2014 and it\u2019s ordering the California National Guard to claw back thousands of dollars paid to soldiers who to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan.

        "The men parked their white work van on a patch of dirt down the road from the college where Hillary Clinton was set to give a major speech. Then they attached a banner. It was almost as long as the van with bold vinyl lettering. \u201dTrump that bitch,\u201d it read. They waved and smiled, as people drove by. The message wasn\u2019t subtle. It also wasn\u2019t an outlier, either. It\u2019s a slogan that\u2019s been found on at many Trump rallies since at least March. There are bumper stickers for sale with the slogan, even a bottle of hot sauce.",

        "President Obama\u2019s campaign against the Islamic State is clearly weakening the extremist group. But he\u2019s unlikely to finish the job during his final months, leaving it to his successor, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, to figure out how to keep ISIS on the run. U. S. Iraqi troops are on the march against the ISIS stronghold of Mosul in northern Iraq. In neighboring Syria, ISIS recently lost the symbolically important town of Dabiq.

        "Quick: do you think politicians can still do their jobs if they\u2019ve screwed up in their personal lives? Many Americans answer this question differently now than they would have five years ago. And for white evangelical Protestants, it\u2019s especially likely their opinion has changed.

        "ATT\u2019s $85. bid to buy Time Warner is now official, facing what\u2019s expected to be a tough regulatory review, given the reach and impact of the telecom and the media behemoths. The deal is a large one for both spaces, though each has seen a fair amount of reshuffling in the power rankings over the years. (In fact, both ATT and Time Warner are themselves results of consolidation and .)

        "Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of several things, among them race. The law, however, doesn\u2019t define \u201drace.\u201d It also doesn\u2019t say anything about hair. Which brings us to Chastity Jones. In 2012, Jones, who is was denied a job because she wouldn\u2019t cut off her dreadlocks. Jones sued, saying the company was guilty of disparate treatment. When the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against her last month, we got a glimpse of just how complicated race and identity really are.",

We have lamb, we have veal,\u201d says Commissary Officer Alex King who manages the store. \u201dSushi is a big hit here.

Jonathan Taban, a father of six, explained that he\u2019s trying to see when he will receive food rations.

The sandwich man is big, bawdy Arnold Reuben \u2014 he loves to regale audiences with the origin story of his sandwich nearly as much as he loves to name drop the celebrities that frequent the booths of his restaurant. Sometimes, he tells Manoff, in a spitty voice brimming with pride, he even names a special after them. \u201dI\u2019m not like the average delicatessen, boy,\u201d Reuben tells Manoff. \u201dIdeas, I always had ideas about things.",

        "Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren ripped into Donald Trump on Hillary Clinton\u2019s behalf at a rally in New Hampshire on Monday. Warren was playing the role of a sassy friend with the snark to say the things Clinton either could or would not say. \u201dGet this, Donald. Nasty women are tough. Nasty women are smart.

        "A few weeks ago, Donald Trump told a New Hampshire crowd he loves to cite the polls \u2014 when he is ahead. \u201dWhen we do badly, I don\u2019t know about polls, right? But when we\u2019re doing well, I know about polls,\u201d Trump said in Sandown, N. H. on Oct. 6. Since then, Trump has fallen from about 4 points behind Hillary Clinton nationally, to about 6 points. But his positioning in battleground states that will determine which candidate gets to 270 electoral votes has become much more precarious. Trump is now lashing out against those polls."
