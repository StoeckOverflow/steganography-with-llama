        "In a cavernous, auditorium in Washington last month, three officials took the stage. They settled themselves into tan, leather armchairs and fielded questions, including this one: Name a global flashpoint you\u2019re looking to with concern? \u201dNorth Korea,\u201d came the reply from one. \u201dAnd how the United States and China deal with that situation.\u201d The exchange is worth noting because the three people on stage were current or former CIA officials. The one who gave the North Korea answer?",
        "Researchers have launched an innovative medical experiment that\u2019s designed to provide quick answers while meeting the needs of patients, rather than drug companies. Traditional studies can cost hundreds of millions of dollars, and can take many years. But patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease don\u2019t have the time to wait. This progressive disease is usually fatal within a few years. Scientists in an active online patient community identified a potential treatment and have started to gather data from the participants virtually rather than requiring many doctor\u2019s visits. How is that possible?",
        "This intimate, completely unadorned cover of Lou Reed\u2019s \u201dPerfect Day\u201d will warm your heart. Andrew Bird and The National\u2019s Matt Berninger recorded the song together in Bird\u2019s living room Bird provided the instrumentation, his trademark whistling and violin gracefully looping together, and Berninger reads the lyrics from a sheet of paper on the floor. \u201dWhat do you think happens at the end of the [perfect] day,\u201d Berninger asks Bird at the end of the song.",
        "Two weeks from Election Day, it looks more likely than ever that Democrats will win control of the Senate. States that many thought would be the crux of their battle ground map, like Ohio and Florida, have moved down or completely off the list. But Democrats have successfully expanded the map enough so that they have multiple paths to the five seats they need for an outright majority \u2014 or four if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, which also looks increasingly likely. Republicans, however, need a night to keep their majority, and that looks harder and harder each day.",
        "With gun control efforts stalled in Congress and in many statehouses, advocates are forging another path forward: They\u2019re going straight to the ballot box. Voters in four states will weigh gun control initiatives Nov. 8 ballot: Maine, Nevada, Washington and California. In Nevada and Maine, voters are being asked whether to strengthen background check requirements for gun sales. Washington State voters already did that now they\u2019re considering whether to allow a court to take guns away from potentially dangerous people.",
        "The Vatican has issued new guidelines recommending that the cremated remains of Catholics be buried in cemeteries, rather than scattered or kept at home. \u201dFollowing the most ancient Christian tradition, the Church insistently recommends that the bodies of the deceased be buried in cemeteries or other sacred places,\u201d state the guidelines released Tuesday by the Vatican.",
        "ATT\u2019s proposed $85. 4 billion acquisition of Time Warner has cast renewed attention on the financial performance and journalistic independence of one of the media conglomerate\u2019s possessions, CNN. \u201dYou have to allow the organization to run independently,\u201d ATT Chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson tells NPR. \u201dIt\u2019s not an altruistic thing either. I mean, I personally think it\u2019s a smart business thing to do.",
        "Telecom giant ATT has reached an $85. 4 billion deal to buy media titan Time Warner. The news of this transformational merger has shaken up both industries, raising eyebrows on Wall Street and drawing criticism from lawmakers and even the presidential campaigns. The deal is expected to face stringent scrutiny from regulators: the Department of Justice, which considers antitrust laws, and potentially also the Federal Communications Commission, which broadly weighs whether deals are in the public interest.",
        "When parents think of the risks of flying, they usually think of turbulence, emergency landings or horrific crashes. Hot coffee probably doesn\u2019t top the list. But when children are injured on airlines, they\u2019re most likely to get hurt the same ways they do on the ground. The most likely cause of injury is burns from hot drinks, according to data presented Monday at the American Academy of Pediatrics conference. That accounted for 39 percent of injuries. Meal service was the most likely time. Sometimes the drinks splashed while they were being passed from person to person.",
        "It\u2019s a familiar scene for parents everywhere: They put down the baby in the bassinet to sleep, and those tiny eyes flutter shut. Then they flutter back open and the crying starts. The only thing perhaps more harrowing than those long wakeful nights of a baby\u2019s first year is the fear that one day the child won\u2019t wake up. A notable, if subtle, change in sleep guidelines released Monday by the American Academy of Pediatrics acknowledges the reality of those long nights and what parents should do if they can\u2019t always follow the guidelines to the letter.",
        "When scientists want to know what our ancient ancestors ate, they can look at a few things: fossilized animal bones with marks from tools used to butcher and cut them fossilized poop and teeth. The first two can tell us a lot, but they\u2019re hard to come by in the fossil record. Thankfully, there are a lot of teeth to fill in the gaps. \u201dThey preserve really well,\u201d explains Debbie a dental anthropologist at Ohio State University.",
        "Along the border between the U. S. and Mexico, armed groups on patrol \u2014 mostly men \u2014 look for illegal immigrants and drug traffickers. They\u2019re not U. S. Border Patrol, but regular people who\u2019ve decided to take matters into their own hands. They call themselves militias. Groups such as these have been around for decades, but they exploded in number after Barack Obama was elected president. Today, there are 276 militia groups around the country, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.",
        "When you\u2019re facing a major life change, it helps to talk to someone who\u2019s already been through it. All Things Considered is connecting people on either side of a shared experience, and they\u2019re letting us eavesdrop on their conversations in our series Been There. Liv Aannestad has known she wanted kids as long as she can remember. \u201dI always assumed it would happen the normal, typical way: I\u2019d meet somebody, maybe either in high school or college, and maybe have a few babies,\u201d she says.",
        "A bloody Taj Mahal. A haunted Colosseum. A toxic Capitol Hill. Welcome to the \u201dNightmare Machine,\u201d a project created by three researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Pinar Yanardag, Manuel Cebrian and Iyad Rahwan used artificial intelligence algorithms \u201dto learn how haunted houses, or toxic cities look. . ..",
        "Antarctica\u2019s ice has been melting, most likely because of a warming climate. Now, newly published research shows the rate of melting appears to be accelerating. Antarctica is bigger than the U. S. and Mexico combined, and it\u2019s covered in deep ice \u2014 more than a mile deep in some places. Most of the ice sits on bedrock, but it slowly flows off the continent\u2019s edges. Along the western edge, giant glaciers creep down toward the sea. Where they meet the ocean, they form ice shelves.",
        "Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump seized on rising health insurance premiums Tuesday as evidence that \u201dObamacare is just blowing up.\u201d But the general manager of a Trump golf course in Florida corrected his boss for suggesting that Trump\u2019s own employees would be personally affected. \u201dAll of my employees are having a tremendous problem with Obamacare,\u201d Trump told reporters during an appearance at the National Doral Golf Club in Miami.",
        "A federal judge has approved Volkswagen\u2019s $14. 7 billion settlement over the carmaker\u2019s vehicle emissions scandal. The process of compensating affected U. S. car owners is beginning now, with the first buybacks expected to happen within the next few weeks. Under the terms of the deal, Volkswagen agrees to either buy back or repair vehicles involved in the scandal. That means paying as much as $10. 033 billion to owners. In addition, the carmaker has come to an agreement with the United States under which it will pay nearly $5 billion in environmental remediation.",
        "The Amorphophallus titanum is a striking plant even before you get close enough to smell it. Its scientific name means giant, misshapen phallus and it is not hard to see why. A giant column called a spadix rises 7 feet into the air from the center of a pleated funnel. When the plant blooms (every decade or so) that spadix actually heats up to about 90 degrees. The stench that inspires its common name \u2014 the corpse flower \u2014 comes from a putrid blend of chemicals the bloom sends into the air.",
        "VH1 is the fastest growing entertainment network on cable TV and it produces three of the top five cable reality shows. On top of all that, it\u2019s one of the channels in that prized demographic of to . Chris McCarthy, president of VH1, MTV and Logo, says VH1\u2019s success hinges partly on \u201990s nostalgia. Today\u2019s think \u201dthe \u201990s were just better.\u201d \u201dThe economy was better\u201d he says. \u201d. .. It\u2019s different than any other decade. Like, after Sept. 11, things just changed.\u201d Now, VH1 is about to launch a scripted show about set in 1990.",
        "It has become a familiar story in a world bristling with live mics. A public figure is caught out using a vulgarity, and the media have to decide how to report the remark. Web media tend to be explicit, but the traditional media are more circumspect. Take the vulgar epithet that George W. Bush was overheard using to describe a New York Times reporter during the 2000 presidential campaign. Some newspapers printed it with dashes or asterisks.",
        "China\u2019s ruling Communist Party is pledging tighter discipline than ever for its 88 million members and no let up in a campaign that has seen more than 1 million officials investigated for graft. The party\u2019s since it doesn\u2019t allow much independent oversight, is the focus of the party\u2019s most important meeting of the year this week. The conclave will lay the groundwork for an expected second and final term for President Xi Jinping, following a congress of party delegates next fall. The drive has boosted Xi\u2019s popularity among the populace.",
        "Polls show the presidential race in Texas is closer than it\u2019s been in decades. Some even show the two candidates within the margin of error. Does Hillary Clinton actually stand a chance in Texas? It\u2019s unlikely, but it could be closer than at any time in the past 20 years. The reason for how competitive the race looks lies in two demographic groups \u2014 suburban women offended by Trump\u2019s comments about women, and Latinos, who are fired up to vote against him. Suburban women cool to Trump, Part of the answer might be found in the suburbs of Dallas.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign has been dealing with the fallout from her choice to use a private email server while secretary of state since before there was even officially a campaign. Now, WikiLeaks has released private emails from March 2015 between Clinton advisers talking about how to handle the email mess. Clinton\u2019s campaign says the email release is part of a Russian effort to interfere with the U. S. election. The campaign has chosen not to verify the authenticity of the emails hacked from the personal Gmail account of Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta.",
        "With less than two weeks to go before Election Day, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have each framed a closing argument to voters. Each is also focusing on battleground states in ways that reveal different paths to victory \u2014 earning 270 electoral votes on election night. (You can read more about the state of play here.) Here, we lay out what voters will see from each candidate in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign.",
        "Public health authorities and infectious disease specialists now say we may not be able to rid the U. S. of the Zika virus. Despite months of intense work \u2014 including house to house inspections and aggressive mosquito control \u2014 federal, state and local officials have not been able to stop the spread of Zika in Miami. In Miami on Tuesday, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Tom Frieden, delivered what he called the \u201dplain truth\u201d about Zika and the mosquitoes that carry it.",
        "Updated at 11:30 p. m. ET, The Chicago Cubs beat the Cleveland Indians in Game 2 of the World Series. The Series is tied one game apiece as the action moves to Chicago for Game 3 on Friday. Cubs starting pitcher Jake Arrieta disarmed the Indians batters, holding them hitless until the sixth inning, when they scored their only run. The Indians stranded two runners in the seventh inning, a runner in the eighth inning and another in the ninth. But they never mounted a real challenge to Cubs relievers Mike Montgomery or Aroldis Chapman.",
        "If it\u2019s true that misery loves company, then the heartbreaking failures of the Chicago Cubs over the last century certainly cemented bonds through generations of fans. The Cubs are in the World Series for the first time in 71 years, and they haven\u2019t won the fall classic since 1908. That makes this year\u2019s success somewhat bittersweet for many fans in Chicago, who remember parents, grandparents, spouses and other loved ones who didn\u2019t live long enough to see this day.",
        "If you want to feel virtuous the next time you chug a brewski, consider the Long Root Ale. This new beer, mildly fragrant and with a spiciness, is the first to use Kernza, a kind of wheat that could make agriculture more sustainable, especially in the face of climate change. What makes Kernza environmentally friendly is its biology. It\u2019s a perennial plant, meaning it grows season after season.",
        "It\u2019s now official: Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio has been formally charged with criminal contempt of court, with prosecutors saying he disobeyed a judge\u2019s order in a racial profiling case. The sheriff for much of the Phoenix metro area could face up to six months behind bars if convicted. The misdemeanor charge against Arpaio, 84, was formally lodged Tuesday, after U. S. District Judge Susan Bolton signed an order to show cause."
