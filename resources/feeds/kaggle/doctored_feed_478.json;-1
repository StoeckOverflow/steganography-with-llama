        "A rock found on a farm field in South Wales, the rock had no known purpose and is a very strange looking shape and size for being on farmed land but this strange discovery may hold some answers and could even have tipped over to help the ancient civilisation. obviously it' to big in one spot as it looks more or a bolt of some sort or it'S a huge chunk outta the stone wall, I would be inclines to look at that as it'D look a hell of much strange if found on it own or it",
        "There may be no better place than New Orleans to explore the ties of family and tradition in jazz. This episode of Jazz Night in America visits the Crescent City to hear two local musical giants: singer John Boutt\u00e9 and drummer Shannon Powell. The video documentary presents highlights from their shared concert at the George and Joyce Wein Jazz and Heritage Center, while the radio episode also spends time with each of them at their homes, tracing their familial roots and exploring why they\u2019ve chosen to stay local. Powell was born and raised in Treme, one of the U.",
        "The U. S. Department of Justice has charged 61 people and entities with conspiracy and fraud over a scam that involved phone calls from people pretending to be from the IRS or other government agencies. The conspiracy defrauded at least 15, 000 people of more than $300 million, the U. S. government says. The defendants \u2014 56 people and five call center groups \u2014 were indicted last week, and the documents were unsealed on Thursday.",
        "True story: The other day, I attended a speech by IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, who said phone scammers are swarming the country in the to April 15, aka Tax Day. These criminals call taxpayers and insist they must \u201dimmediately give up their personal information or make a payment,\u201d Koskinen warned. Don\u2019t fall for it. \u201dIf you are surprised to be hearing from us, you are not hearing from us,\u201d Koskinen said.",
        "Conservationists often discuss the fact that hunting bush meat in tropical areas is creating an ecological and public health crisis. Though there\u2019s no tally of how much bush meat is hunted worldwide, a study published this month found that 301 species of mammals are at risk of going extinct from illegal hunting. In the Congo alone, between 1 million and 4. 5 million tons of bush meat \u2014 wild animals like gorillas and endangered dukiers \u2014 are harvested each year.",
        "Warplanes repeatedly bombed a complex of three schools in northern Syria on Wednesday in what UNICEF is calling one of the deadliest attacks on schools since the conflict began more than five years ago. \u201dThis is a tragedy. It is an outrage. And if deliberate, it is a war crime,\u201d said UNICEF Director Anthony Lake. \u201dChildren lost forever to their families . .. teachers lost forever to their students . .. one more scar on Syria\u2019s future.\u201d UNICEF said the airstrikes in the village of Hass in the rebel stronghold of Idlib killed 22 children and six teachers.",
        "When I was 6 years old, my mom woke up, got out of bed and crashed to the floor. That\u2019s when she figured out half her body was paralyzed. The left side. Right down the middle, like a paper doll folded at the center. She made it to the phone, called a guy she\u2019d just started dating, asked him to take her to the hospital. When he rang the bell, my mom had to drag the limp half of her body backward, down the stairs, to open the door for him.",
        "Call it a win for the Walloons. The Belgian government says it has broken a deadlock over a major trade agreement between the European Union and Canada, known as the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement. The deal had been held up in the final days by Wallonia, a tiny enclave in the small country of Belgium. The roughly 3. 5 million Walloons account for less than 1 percent of the entire population of the European Union, which has more than 500 million residents. While their numbers may be small, the Walloons\u2019 vote packs a wallop.",
        "Poorly managed projects. Questionable spending. Dubious claims of success. That\u2019s how an NPR report last year described recovery efforts in Haiti from international humanitarian groups after the earthquake in 2010. That\u2019s why NGOs \u2014 nongovernmental organizations \u2014 helping out in the wake of Hurricane Matthew know they need to get it right this time. But that\u2019s easier said than done.",
        "Aging can take a toll on teeth, and for many older people paying for dental services is a serious concern because they can\u2019t rely on their Medicare coverage. seniors in particular are struggling. More than a third with incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level (about $23, 000 annually) had untreated tooth decay between 2011 and 2014, according to an analysis of federal data by the American Dental Association.",
        ", Placebos can\u2019t cure diseases, but research suggests that they seem to bring some people relief from subjective symptoms, such as pain, nausea, anxiety and fatigue. But there\u2019s a reason your doctor isn\u2019t giving you a sugar pill and telling you it\u2019s a new wonder drug. The thinking has been that you need to actually believe that you\u2019re taking a real drug in order to see any benefits. And a doctor intentionally deceiving a patient is an ethical .",
        "The European Union is desperate to keep Syrian refugees from bolting from Turkey for Europe. But the prospects for Syrians in Turkey have been slim. Now the EU is launching its biggest aid program yet \u2014 more than $375 million aimed at a million of the neediest Syrians in Turkey. And it\u2019s not bags of rice thrown from the back of a truck. It\u2019s a bit more modern: a debit card that can be used to buy whatever food, medicine or clothing a family needs, or to get cash.",
        "Gruel, glop, cooked mush. The English language has been less than kind in describing porridge. Which seems a tad ungrateful, really, considering that grains cooked in water or milk fed our earliest civilizations. But now, this stalwart dish is staging a culinary comeback. Think steaming, millet topped with coarsely grated Gruyere cheese. Buckwheat cooked in coconut milk, with buttered dates and cinnamon. Teff polenta garlanded with diced dandelion greens and freshly grated parmesan. \u201dPorridges today can blow you away with their color, flavor and texture,\u201d explains Maria Speck, author of Ancient Grains for Modern Meals and Simply Ancient Grains.",
        "A convoy of Russian warships will not be stopping for fuel at a Spanish port, Russia said Wednesday, after Spain\u2019s NATO allies objected to the refueling plan. NATO members are worried the ships are intended to support increased Russian airstrikes in Syria. The convoy includes Russia\u2019s only aircraft carrier. Some ships in the convoy had been planning to stop for fuel in Ceuta, a Spanish enclave in North Africa directly across from Gibraltar. It\u2019s normal practice for Spain to allow Russian warships to stop at its ports, The Associated Press reports.",
        "He leaned against the subway doors in a faded denim jacket, camo cargo pants, combat boots and, to top it off, a black ski mask. I wondered if he had a gun. I wondered if he was a white supremacist. I wondered if he had seen my friend and me, with our brown skin and black hair. Our Islamic faith and immigrant parents \u2014 could he somehow see that, too? Was it me, or were his eyes darting up and down the crowded subway car? I yanked on my friend\u2019s sleeve and raised my mouth to his ear.",
        "It\u2019s hard to imagine a more desolate, landscape than the great salt flats in Bolivia. The Salar de Uyuni stretch as far as the eye can see for thousands of square miles, with nothing to disturb the horizon but a vast layer of salt several feet thick. It\u2019s like a surreal, alien planet completely incapable of supporting any life.",
        "Protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline have been raging for months, but tensions have been escalating. Recently, tribal leaders \u2014 led by Standing Rock Sioux tribe Chairman Dave Archambault II \u2014 called on the Department of Justice to look into what they describe as unnecessary use of force by state and local law enforcement. The tribe is going up against Energy Transfer Partners, an oil giant intending to build the $3. 8 billion pipeline to carry more than a barrels of oil a day through four states and their watersheds. The tribe wants to stop it.",
        "The National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, is called The Nation\u2019s Report Card for good reason the tests are administered the same way year after year, using the same kind of test booklets, to students across the country. That allows researchers and educators to compare student progress over time. NAEP tests serve as a big research project to benchmark academic achievement in subjects like science, math, reading, writing, civics, economics, geography and U. S. history. Science results were out Thursday for 4th, 8th, and 12th graders.",
        "Boy, that escalated quickly. Tuesday night\u2019s intense exchange between Fox News host Megyn Kelly and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich demonstrated the current state of the election \u2014 and especially why Donald Trump appears to be shedding many voters, especially women. The subtext proved if anything more striking. The segment initially promised nothing more than chummy debate staged between colleagues for a cable audience. It quickly swerved into charged disputes over the media\u2019s coverage of allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault by Trump.",
        "Note: NPR\u2019s First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the Spotify playlist at the bottom of the page. Even if you\u2019ve never heard Hope Sandoval\u2019s music, you\u2019ll know her M. O. well before the end of Until The Hunter\u2019s first song: This is an artist who takes her time. For the nine minutes \u201dInto The Trees\u201d takes to unfold, the singer coos a few words in a drowsily longing whisper \u2014 \u201dI miss you\u201d \u2014 over a bed of organs.",
        "Updated at 7:58 p. m. ET, Newly discovered emails being examined by the FBI in relation to Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server came to light in the course of an unrelated criminal investigation of Anthony Weiner, a source familiar with the matter tells NPR\u2019s Carrie Johnson. Weiner is the estranged husband of close Clinton aide Huma Abedin he has been under scrutiny for sending illicit text messages to an underage girl. Sources said authorities seized electronic devices in their home, which led them to this new information.",
        "Hillary Clinton enters the homestretch of the presidential race with a sizable fundraising lead over Republican rival Donald Trump. Many GOP donors appear to have shifted their giving to candidates for House and Senate. And Trump himself has contributed just over half the $100 million he pledged to help bankroll his own campaign. Finance reports filed Thursday show Clinton\u2019s campaign raised nearly twice as much money as Trump\u2019s in the first 19 days of October and had nearly four times as much cash on hand.",
        "Shortly after news about newly discovered emails related to Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server investigation broke on Friday, Republican strategist Patrick Ruffini noticed something: Here\u2019s a closer look at what Ruffini is talking about. Around the time that the email news broke, the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted from a peak of 18, 255 to a trough of 18, 097. That\u2019s not quite 1 percent, but the sharp drop, albeit small, is a sign of a broader storyline that has persisted through this election: that investors are scared of a Trump presidency.",
        "The Supreme Court said Friday it will hear a case regarding transgender students\u2019 right to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. The justices will hear the case sometime next year. At issue is whether a Virginia high school student is allowed to use the boys\u2019 bathroom.

        "A girl fights a Pokemon character in a parking lot and gets sucked into a Poke Ball. A mustachioed man, pretending to be El Chapo, runs through a cave, then a fast food restaurant and then a mall in search of Donald Trump, whom viewers see video of making denigrating comments about Mexicans. A young man satirizes the spare dishes presented in fancy restaurants. These are the types of wacky, videos that will be missed now that Twitter is winding down its video app, Vine. (To be clear, Vine says it won\u2019t delete its videos. As least, for now.",
        "The Internet is still coming to terms with the fact that Twitter is shuttering Vine, the beloved app. Vine not only brought together a unique group of young creatives \u2014 a \u201dslew of comedians, musicians, artists and amateur directors,\u201d as NPR\u2019s Alina Selyukh wrote yesterday \u2014 it also became a place where black and brown artists and amateur entertainers thrived. (Kat Chow over at Code Switch has more on that.) Plus, cute animals. Vine is of adorable creatures doing silly things. It\u2019s Friday, so here are some of our favorites.",
        "In North Dakota, tension over the Dakota Access oil pipeline is escalating. Police and National Guard troops arrested more than 140 protesters near a construction site Thursday. The Standing Rock Sioux have sued to stop the pipeline from crossing under the Missouri River next to their reservation, claiming the project would destroy sacred sites and threaten the water supply. What started months ago as a dispute between a tribe and the federal government has escalated into clashes between protesters and police.",
        "The video shows an enraged man repeatedly hitting a woman in an apartment elevator. Filmed in the northern Chinese city of Langfang, the security camera footage went viral last Friday. In the video, the woman fights back, eventually pushing the man out of the elevator as her child cowers behind a bicycle. The reason for his behavior? The woman said she requested that he stop smoking in the elevator. According to Chinese media, the man is still at large.",
        "Matt O\u2019Hayer thought he was in the idyllic part of the egg business. He\u2019s CEO of Vital Farms, based in Austin, Texas, which markets eggs from hens that run around outdoors, on grassy pastures, at about a hundred different farms. \u201dI thought that there\u2019s nothing more beautiful than eggs, where you have sort of a symbiotic relationship you take care of the hen and she gives you this little gift every day,\u201d says O\u2019Hayer. Until a few years ago, he never thought about where those hens come from, or what happened to their male siblings."
