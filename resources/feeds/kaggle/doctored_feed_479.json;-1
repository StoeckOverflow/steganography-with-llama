        "How do you get women who never talk about breast cancer to start opening up? That was the question on the mind of Usman Saleemi, who along with colleagues Tiya Fazelbhoy and Jaison Ben created a bra designed to encourage breast among women in Pakistan. According to Pink Ribbon, a national breast cancer charity based in Lahore, Pakistan has the highest incidence of breast cancer in Asia. More than 40, 000 women lose their lives to the disease each year. But while many cases of breast cancer can be successfully treated, the very topic is taboo in Pakistan.",
        "Maybe this election cycle really is getting to us. On Friday, one report showed the economy is growing at a surprisingly quick pace, but another found consumers are feeling less upbeat. The Commerce Department said the economy grew by 2. 9 percent in this year\u2019s third quarter. That\u2019s a very solid expansion \u2014 the fastest pace in two years. It exceeded the 2. 5 percent rate most economists had been forecasting. So the upswing in gross domestic product, the widest measure of economic activity, should be making consumers feel more cheerful, right? It\u2019s not.",

        "Those first bubbles were almost a revelation. A couple of days before, I had mixed together flour and water into a paste. But now pockets of gas percolated through that seemingly inert glob. It was breathing. It was alive. This gloppy mess, exuding a whiff of vinegar, was my nascent sourdough starter. When mature, it would be a pungent brew of yeasts and bacteria, a complex ecosystem that would hopefully yield delicious loaves of sourdough bread.",

It was just the twins Meegan and Allison Closner and their older sister, Natalie Closner, and it was clear then they had something special. Over these two years, Joseph\u2019s sound has grown beyond the Closners\u2019 harmonies.

        "During political campaigns, many dollar figures get tossed about as candidates discuss the national debt, the deficit, and taxes. But in some states, this could be the figure that will matter most: $7. 25. That\u2019s the amount workers get paid per hour under federal law. Polls show voters overwhelmingly support a higher wage, and 28 states and the District of Columbia already have passed laws forcing employers to pay more than the national minimum.
