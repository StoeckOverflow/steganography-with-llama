        "Updated at 7 30 p. The police had arrested him. He had come here, as he said later at his press, and was taken away to be shot on a lon. Police arrested more than two hundred people for disrespect.\nHe came here from a place that no white had visited since it fell to us and that few of their people would ever again look. We have no idea of who or even of whether there has even been. Police say a gunshot that rang from the back. Police officers had been ordered not only not fire into",
        "A large space rock came fairly close to Earth on Sunday night. Astronomers knew it wasn\u2019t going to hit Earth, thanks in part to a new tool NASA is developing for detecting potentially dangerous asteroids. The tool is a computer program called Scout, and it\u2019s being tested at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Think of Scout as a celestial intruder alert system. It\u2019s constantly scanning data from telescopes to see if there are any reports of Near Earth Objects.",
        "Three space travelers landed safely back on Earth late Saturday night. The journey began in the evening, 5:12 p. m. ET to be exact, when the hatch to the International Space Station closed, and Kate Rubins, Anatoly Ivanishin and Takuya Onishi climbed into the cramped Soyuz spacecraft that would bring them home. About three hours later, they separated from the space station as it flew over Mongolia. Inside, Ivanishin was at the controls as the ship\u2019s commander.",
        "Fadi has learned to adjust his Syrian pastries to American tastes at the City Steam Brewery caf\u00e9 in downtown Hartford, Connecticut. \u201dAmerica, chocolate!\u201d he says, as he adjusts his baseball cap and serves his latest confection. It\u2019s not the only thing he\u2019s learned since he and his family were catapulted into a new life after arriving as refugees in May. There\u2019s a beautiful system in America compared to Syria, Asmi explains through an interpreter. \u201dOver there, the big guys eat the little guys,\u201d he says.",
        "Joel McHale made a name for himself by skewering celebrities and the world they live in on E! Network\u2019s The Soup. Then he became a celebrity in his own right: He was in the hit NBC show Community and now he stars in the new CBS comedy The Great Indoors. In a new memoir, McHale again takes aim at the nature of celebrity \u2014 by making fun of celebrity memoirs.",
        "When I was young, there were basically two schools of thought about girls. According to one saying, girls were made of greasy grimy gophers\u2019 guts, little birdies\u2019 dirty feet, all wrapped up in poison ivy leaves. The other, associated with Mother Goose, offered a different picture. Girls, so it was recited, were made of sugar and spice and everything nice. I was with Mother Goose. I thought of these gender skirmishes the other day when I noticed how the tables have turned \u2014 at least as far as our views of sugar are concerned.",
        "It was almost too much for Rick Swenson to take. First, his friend smashed a car by dropping a pumpkin on it at a charity event \u2014 then he had to stand by as that same friend smashed Swenson\u2019s personal record by growing another monster. Swenson, a competitive pumpkin grower from Minnesota, couldn\u2019t just let his friend him like this. So, Rick Swenson cultivated an idea to take back bragging rights: He would go for the world record for the longest distance paddled in a giant pumpkin. Yes, apparently that\u2019s a thing.",
        "A Halloween apple bob may seem as homespun as a hayride, but that shiny red apple has a steamy past. It was once a powerful symbol of fertility and immortality. Apple bobbing and eating candy apples are \u201dthe fossilized remnants of beliefs that ultimately go back to prehistory,\u201d British apple expert and fruit historian, Joan Morgan, tells the Salt. Morgan and I The New Book of Apples several years back. I asked her this week for a refresher on the fruit\u2019s tricks and treats.",
        "It\u2019s Halloween \u2014 a time for Frankenstein monsters and vampires and werewolves. But many of us have our own monsters from different cultures, and when we threw out a call to our readers asking what ghost stories and folktales they grew up with in their own traditions, we got back stories of creatures stalking the shadows of Latin American hallways and vengeful demons from South Asia with backwards feet. (And that\u2019s before we get to the and the infernal bathroom stalls.) Below are some of the best we\u2019ve found or that were told to us from Code Switch readers.",
        "Whenever you surf the Web, sophisticated algorithms are tracking where you go, comparing you with millions of other people. They\u2019re trying to predict what you\u2019ll do next: Apply for a credit card? Book a family vacation? At least 40 percent of universities report that they\u2019re trying some version of the same technology on their students, according to several recent surveys. It\u2019s known as predictive analytics, and it can be used to either help or hurt students, says a new report from the New America Foundation.",
        "After a mother killed her four young children and then herself last month in rural China, onlookers quickly pointed to life circumstances. The family lived in extreme poverty, and bloggers speculated that her inability to escape adversity pushed her over the edge. Can poverty really cause mental illness? It\u2019s a complex question that is fairly new to science. Despite high rates of both poverty and mental disorders around the world, researchers only started probing the possible links about 25 years ago.",
        "There\u2019s an etiquette to holiday decorations. The should be tossed in the compost on November 1st and the Christmas tree ornaments need to stay in the attic until Thanksgiving dinner is over. And in my family, there\u2019s another holiday tradition to consider: On Diwali, we put out swastikas. The South Asian holiday of Diwali is often called the festival of lights, but I think of it as Christmas with fireworks.",
        "At just about every Hillary Clinton campaign event this year, and much of last, you could find lots of rainbows and posters with the letters \u201dLGBT\u201d on them in the crowd. The average Hillary Clinton event has a healthy amount of gay, lesbian and transgender Clinton supporters in attendance. This past Thursday at a rally by Clinton and first lady Michelle Obama, Charlotte resident Matt Hirschy wore a \u201dH\u201d sticker and a wedding ring. Before the rally, he was still celebrating the achievements of last year, namely the Supreme Court\u2019s Obergefell v.",
        "In an instant, everything changes. Suddenly, all practical perception escapes, and in its place arises a fantastical world that teasingly mirrors the reality we call our own. It\u2019s called virtual reality, or VR, and it\u2019s this technology that game developer Jonathan Schenker has a passion for. Schenker and his colleague Aaron Stanton created the VR game QuiVr \u2014 and, as he tells NPR\u2019s Rachel Martin, he was alarmed to discover a female user had been harassed while playing it.",
        "One more win and baseball fans everywhere might finally believe in these Cleveland Indians. That\u2019s all it will take for Corey Kluber Co. to clinch this World Series. Kluber pitched six sparkling innings on short rest to win again, Jason Kipnis hit a homer in his hometown and the Indians beat the Chicago Cubs Saturday night to take a lead. Carlos Santana also connected for the first of his three hits as Cleveland moved closer to its first championship since 1948.",
        "Nurse practitioner Kim Hamm talks in soothing tones to her patient as she inserts a form of contraception beneath the skin of the girl\u2019s upper arm. \u201dThis is the numbing medicine, so you\u2019re going to feel me touch you here,\u201d she says, taking the teen\u2019s arm. \u201dLittle stick, one, two three, ouch.

        "FBI Director James Comey\u2019s letter to Congress reporting a renewed look into emails that could be related to Hilary Clinton\u2019s private server rocked the presidential race on Friday. The Clinton campaign and supporters have jumped on Comey for making such a dramatic announcement so close to an election. The question being raised now is whether the timing and style of the announcement make it illegal. Democrats allege this is more than just an inconvenience.",

ET, In a letter to several Democratic senators Monday, the Justice Department said it \u201dwill continue to work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible\u201d regarding the review of thousands of newly discovered emails that may be relevant to the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server.",
        "One question on many people\u2019s minds is whether polling places will be disrupted on Election Day. There are concerns that vigilantes, armed with cameras and notebooks, will intimidate voters they suspect of committing fraud. Such groups insist they\u2019ll follow the law, but civil rights groups are on alert just in case. There have already been some disturbing incidents. In Durham, N. C. a voter reported someone videotaping license plates outside an site. In West Palm Beach, Fla. a voter complained of being intimidated by a rowdy group of electioneers.",

But one outlier has caused a lot of friction in the Valley. Peter Thiel is part of what many people in the Valley call \u201dthe PayPal mafia,\u201d a group of investors who got very rich by helping to fund PayPal.",
        "Voice recognition surrounds Americans, from Siri to Google Assistant to Amazon Echo. Its omnipresence can make it easy to forget that making this technology has been really, really hard. Understanding human speech is one of the most difficult frontiers in machine learning, and the biggest names in technology have devoted much time and money to conquering it. But their products still work for only a handful of languages. Less prominent languages are still indecipherable to computers \u2014 even for text translations, let alone voice recognition.",
        "At the Supreme Court on Monday, the justices heard arguments in the case of a girl with disabilities, her service dog and the school that barred the dog from the premises. Ehlena Fry was born with cerebral palsy, which significantly limits her mobility but not her cognitive skills. So when she was about to enter kindergarten in Napoleon, Mich. her parents got a trained service dog \u2014 a white furry goldendoodle, named Wonder.",
        "In Florence, Italy, Tom Hanks has partial amnesia, but that doesn\u2019t stop him from battling extremists and a virus they created to end earth\u2019s population surge by wiping out half of humanity. That\u2019s right, it\u2019s another Dan Brown only this time Hanks isn\u2019t fighting the secret society of Illuminati. In Inferno, his character, Robert Langdon, has a handful of days to stop the virus from being deployed. Fortunately, he\u2019s got the undercover military branch of the World Health Organization on his side.",
        "Over the past week, we asked our audience to share their questions on global diseases, which we would then answer in a story. It\u2019s a topic that\u2019s been making headlines for the last two years, as Ebola and Zika, two diseases that previously had a low profile, became serious worldwide concerns. Earlier this month, we gathered over 200 questions from our readers. We put three of them up for vote. More than 200 people voted, and this question submitted by reader Ian Matthews was the winner: How can we stop the spread of antimicrobial resistance?",

Fayer is offering gene sequencing for newborns. It gives parents a tantalizing look at their baby\u2019s genetic information. New parents Lauren and Ian Patrick, from Marion, Mass. were excited when they were first approached earlier this month. \u201dMy initial reaction \u2014 why wouldn\u2019t someone do this? Why wouldn\u2019t they want the information?\u201d Ian Patrick says as he cradles his newborn son, Finn.",
        "Foreign journalists\u2019 access to Syria is severely restricted, but this week, the regime of Bashar Assad extended an unusual invitation to a group of Western reporters to visit Damascus, the capital. NPR\u2019s Peter Kenyon and Alison Meuse are among the foreign journalists who\u2019ve been granted visas to Damascus this week. For Kenyon, it\u2019s the first time back since 2008, before the 2011 uprising that led to Syria\u2019s war. He spoke with Morning Edition host Renee Montagne about the visit.

        "Young children and teenagers are increasingly likely to be poisoned by opioid painkillers that are often prescribed for other family members, a study finds. The rate of children hospitalized for opioid poisoning increased 165 percent from 1997 to 2012, from about 1. 40 per 100, 000 kids to 3. 71 per 100, 000.

        "In the small town of Sunderland, Mass. is a plot of land that fuses fine art and farming. Mike Wissemann\u2019s cornfield maze is a feat of ingenuity, with carefully planned and executed replicas of notables such as the Mona Lisa, Albert Einstein and Salvador Dal\u00ed. But how do those pictures come to life? Maybe you remember puzzles, in which the clues are squares that have labels like or each one holding part of the design. When those parts are copied into a blank grid, they create a whole picture. Corn is also planted on a grid.",

She tells NPR\u2019s Robert Siegel that she didn\u2019t always perform impressions. \u201dI always thought that was sort of Saturday Night Live\u2019s area,\u201d she says. \u201dBut I decided to throw a few into the mix a few years ago to see if I could do it, because I like being real people and . .. observing society around me. . .."
