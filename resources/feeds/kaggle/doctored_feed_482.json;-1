I am the one with this problem, the same goes for a man that does that, but the woman does the work of her father. You have my support and pray you find the right one for me and for both our daughters! The only time a wife can be just with you in bed, you should always take care to keep it as the main purpose and goal and you are on the track for great marvel of love and affecti.",
        "Only three people in history\u2014all women and America women Collins joined Genesis as the band\u2019s drummer in 1970. Five years later, he became the frontman when lead singer Peter Gabriel left. Collins says it was a gradual transition. The band was auditioning singers while working on a new album, but when it came time to record, he ended up with the job.",
        "Every day at Weiner Elementary School starts with a dance party, usually to Best Day of My Life by American Authors \u2014 and that\u2019s before the 7:50 a. m. bell even rings. Then comes the morning assembly, where all 121 students and the staff gather for 20 minutes in the cafeteria of the school in Weiner, Ark. They sing songs and learn about an artist, a musician and an international city of the week. They celebrate birthdays. A lucky student is crowned Student of the Day.",
        "Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell has her work cut out for her. She has to convince millions of people who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act exchanges or who have no coverage at all that they should go online and shop for a good deal. It\u2019s a big challenge because Tuesday is the first day of open enrollment for Obamacare health insurance, and it comes just a week after HHS announced that the prices of policies sold on the exchanges would rise an average 22 percent for 2017. What\u2019s her biggest challenge?",
        "Last things first. One of the most extraordinary aspects of the third volume of Blanche Wiesen Cook\u2019s monumental biography of Eleanor Roosevelt is the way it ends. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever read another biography where the death of the subject is noted in an aside of less than 10 words, on the second to last page of the book. Bear in mind that, with this third and concluding volume, Cook has devoted almost 2, 000 pages to Eleanor\u2019s life.",
        "Alaska\u2019s Bureau of Land Management regularly posts photos and videos of flying squirrels, scampering porcupines, majestic moose or dramatic landscapes. But the video that went up last week was different. It was ominous. It was mysterious. It was . .. the Chena River Ice Monster, as captured by a baffled BLM employee. The video shows a strange, undulating icy shape appearing to move through the water. The video has a dramatic soundtrack and an overlay of a camcorder, but BLM insisted the footage itself was unedited.",
        "Sex is a fraught subject in April Ayers Lawson\u2019s impressively polished debut collection of stories. The audacious but vulnerable young Southerners who populate these five tales live in a world where the ordinary uncertainties of relationships and physical intimacy are amplified and distorted by their devout, fundamentalist Christian upbringing, and in several cases, a history of childhood sexual abuse. Despite her limpid, supple prose, there\u2019s a creepy cast to Lawson\u2019s vision, with shades of Flannery O\u2019Connor\u2019s dark humor and Southern Gothic sensibility.",
        "A federal judge has tentatively signed off on a $151 million settlement between residents of Charleston, W. Va. and two companies implicated in a 2014 chemical spill that poisoned drinking water for hundreds of thousands of people. Under the proposed deal, the West Virginia American Water Co. will pay up to $126 million and chemical distributor Eastman Chemical will pay $25 million, reports West Virginia Public Broadcasting. U. S. District Judge John Copenhaver tentatively approved the terms on Monday.",
        "There are rating systems for hospitals, nursing homes and doctors. So why is it so hard to compare providers of child care? Part of the reason is that there are no nationally standards for what determines the quality of child care. The standards that do exist are formulated in each state, and they vary widely. For example, some states require that child care workers have a teaching certificate. Others require certain college courses. Some have strict ratios of how many caregivers are required per child.",
        "President Obama said Tuesday that the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers is examining possible alternative routes for the Dakota Access Pipeline. Protesters have been occupying land along the current pipeline route near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota. A federal judge has ruled that work on the pipeline can go forward, but the Corps and two other agencies said work would not go forward in an area particularly sensitive to the tribe until a review was completed.",
        "From the outside, the Syrian war may appear to consume every corner of the country. But inside an ancient Damascus bazaar, the war can feel very far away. The covered Hamidiyeh bazaar has always been a place filled with treasures, and it still feels like the heartbeat of the capital, with throngs of shoppers passing through its grand, gently winding thoroughfare. The arched, black ceiling, three stories high, is pockmarked with holes from years of wear, giving the impression of a starry night sky even on a sunny day.",
        "Updated at 1 a. m. ET, The Chicago Cubs, ending a championship drought that had lasted 108 years, beat the Cleveland Indians in Game 7 of the 2016 World Series at Progressive Field in Cleveland. They did it the hard way, too, coming back from a game deficit by winning three straight games, including the last two on the road in Cleveland. And it took 10 innings to win it all in Game 7. The Cubs are the first team since the 1985 Kansas City Royals to claw back from a deficit in the World Series.",
        "President Obama is vouching for Hillary Clinton in his latest direct appeal to millennial voters. Speaking to Now This News, Obama made his first public statements about the FBI\u2019s renewed focus on evidence possibly tied to Clinton\u2019s private State Department email server. \u201dI know her I trust her,\u201d Obama said.",
        "A week ago, Hillary Clinton was looking to run up the score against Donald Trump. Her campaign was running ads in Texas and planning a trip to the traditionally red state of Arizona. Today, she heads out on that trip, but in a presidential election that has now seen a tightened race from where it was a week and a half ago. It all seems to have shifted after a letter sent Friday by FBI Director James Comey.",
        "Just one week from Election Day, the FBI has made a somewhat puzzling release of information related to a controversial pardon Bill Clinton made on his last day in office almost 16 years ago. On Tuesday, the law enforcement agency released documents related to the former president\u2019s pardon of Marc Rich, a former manager who had been indicted on multiple counts of tax evasion, wire fraud and racketeering. Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign immediately questioned the release, which came from an FBI Twitter account that had been dormant for more than a year up until this past Sunday.",
        "For 26 years, Glamour magazine has reserved the \u201dWomen of the Year\u201d award for, well, women. Previous proposals for a male nominee were rejected \u201don the grounds that men aren\u2019t exactly hurting for awards in this world,\u201d the magazine writes. But this year, the glossy broke with tradition and named Bono as its first Man of the Year. Bono was recognized for establishing a campaign called \u201dPoverty is Sexist,\u201d which is \u201dspecifically aimed at helping the world\u2019s poorest women,\u201d Glamour writes. \u201dI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t deserve it,\u201d Bono told Glamour after he was told of the award.",
        "Hassan Shami camp, about 15 miles east of Mosul, is pristine, the gravel spotless, the rows of tents still white and mostly empty. There aren\u2019t yet the crowds of children, piles of garish mattresses, makeshift bathtubs, bowls of rice and beans that have become familiar sights at Iraq\u2019s many camps for about 2 million people now displaced by the fight against the Islamic State. That is likely to change, and soon. Elite forces are now nudging into the city of Mosul. Thousands of people are fleeing that fighting, many carrying nothing with them.",
        "When it comes to health care, the choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump comes down to whether to keep, or trash, the Affordable Care Act. Trump says he wants to repeal and replace the health care law that is responsible for insuring about 20 million people, while Clinton has vowed to retain it and even expand its reach. Here are the candidates\u2019 plans: Clinton\u2019s plan maintains the basic structure of Obamacare, with its expansion of Medicaid to more people with higher incomes and the ability to buy insurance through exchanges.",
        "Updated Nov. 9, 2016: Proposition 60 was defeated by a margin of nearly 54 percent against and 46 percent in favor, with 99 percent of California precincts reporting. When Mike Stabile first moved to Los Angeles in 2011, he was struck by a freeway billboard that showed a line of cocaine and an overturned shot glass. The caption read: \u201dYou know why. Free HIV test.\u201d \u201dI literally pulled over the car and was like what\u2019s going on?\u201d Stabile remembers.",
        "A suspect is in custody in connection to the killings of two police officers in the Des Moines, Iowa, area, according to police. The two officers were shot and killed early Wednesday as they sat in their squad cars. \u201dThe shootings appear to have been attacks,\u201d police spokesman Paul Parizek said in a statement. The suspect in custody is Scott Michael Greene, a white male resident of Urbandale, a Des Moines suburb. Urbandale police were very familiar with Greene, Urbandale Police Chief Ross McCarty said at a news conference Wednesday. \u201dMost of our officers . ..",
        "It has been more than a year since Stephen Colbert took over as host of CBS\u2019 The Late Show, and he\u2019s finally feeling comfortable being himself and not a character. Before The Late Show, Colbert spent nine years playing the role of a blowhard on Comedy Central\u2019s The Colbert Report. He tells Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross that he initially shied away from discussing politics or current events on The Late Show in an effort to differentiate himself from his Colbert persona. \u201dIt took me almost half a year to realize . ..",
        "Gun control has been a minor theme of this year\u2019s presidential election, as Hillary Clinton promises to close \u201dloopholes\u201d in the background checks for gun purchasers, and Donald Trump pledges \u201dunwavering support\u201d for the Second Amendment. The real battle over guns, though, has been waged at the state level this year \u2014 with a new emphasis on ballot initiatives. Washington is a prime example. Like many western states, it has a tradition of permissive gun laws there\u2019s no minimum waiting period to buy a gun, and the state doesn\u2019t even require safety training for people who carry concealed firearms.",
        "Luxury department store Neiman Marcus is for its opulent holiday offerings. For example, its \u201dChristmas Book\u201d holiday gift guide is offering \u201dIsland cars\u201d for $65, 000 each. And a trip to castles in the U. K. for eight will set you back a cool $700, 000. But a different kind of item is now raising eyebrows: The department store is selling collard greens for $66, plus $15. 50 in shipping.",
        "Thousands of teenagers swoon \u2014 Arabs and Jews alike \u2014 as Tamer Nafar takes the stage. He\u2019s a member of Israel\u2019s Palestinian Arab minority, a founding member of the Palestinian group DAM \u2014 and he sings in Arabic. At this concert last month in northern Israel, part of a multicultural gathering on the sidelines of the Haifa Film Festival, where Israeli musicians of Ethiopian and Indian descent are also performing, \u201dI\u2019m not political,\u201d he raps.",
        "Huddled over a hot griddle in the back of his food truck, Abdel Rahman Rahim doesn\u2019t hold back on the curry powder. He\u2019s frying up shish taouk \u2014 a spicy chicken kebab dish popular in the Middle East. Aromas waft down the block, and a line forms on the city sidewalk next to \u2019s truck \u2014 office workers popping out for a quick bite, a mother and her two children, and a law student on his way home from the gym. With food trucks all the rage, this could be any American city at lunchtime.",
        "Hundreds of white crosses crowd together at Calder\u00f3n cemetery, just outside of Quito, Ecuador. Some are garlanded with rings of purple paper flowers and shiny aluminum leaves. Graves are adorned with elegant bouquets of roses and alstroemeria \u2014 known as lily of the Incas. A solemn spirit fills the crisp air, as wizened women in full wool skirts and head scarves sit by the graves and unwrap their parcels, revealing potatoes boiled with chickpeas, fried pork, fresh fruit and plump bread figures, known as guaguas de pan.",
        "2016 has been particularly hard on music fans of all stripes. Of course, we saw the loss of marquee names like Prince and David Bowie this year. But just about each and every slice of the music world has lost a significant artist \u2014 and, in some cases, way too soon. There\u2019s Juan Gabriel in Latin music, Merle Haggard in country, Maurice White of Earth, Wind Fire in RB, Bobby Hutcherson in jazz.",
        "Mariachi Flor de Toloache is a diverse, bilingual, band that fuses traditional mariachi music with jazz, blues and other forms of Latin American music. (For the crowd, flor de toloache means \u201dtoloache flower,\u201d a Mexican medicinal plant often associated with magic and brujeria, or healing. It\u2019s known to have high toxicity levels, but ancestral indigenous communities actually used it for therapeutic purposes.) Just in time for D\u00eda de Los Muertos, Mariachi Flor de Toloache has dropped a new video for the song \u201dLa Llorona,\u201d from its 2014 debut album.",
        "Ahead of Election Day next week, election officials around the country are checking and their equipment to make sure the results are calculated accurately. Those officials are under increased scrutiny this year with Donald Trump and his allies claiming the voting system could be \u201drigged\u201d in favor of Democrats. So election administrators around the country are opening the doors to the public to show off the multiple layers of safeguards in the process. Last week, the ballot tabulation center in downtown Phoenix was buzzing during a dry run ahead of election night.",
        "It\u2019s a bold move, meant to energize the local fan base. But a Jacksonville baseball team\u2019s decision to rename itself the Jumbo Shrimp is meeting with a mixed reaction. Some say they can\u2019t wait to buy a team jersey in other corners, it\u2019s being panned like so much scampi. A petition has been started. Just like a shrimp, the team says, the new name is rich \u2014 with meaning."
