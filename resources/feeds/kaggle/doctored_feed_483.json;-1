        "Newspaper endorsements have been few in the past.\nIt may be time for some change here, and that'd be OK, as it could lead more candidates and elected office hope to seek a higher calling than self, if you know where I\u2019d saying. I believe the public should hear directly what elected people stand by on issues. That\u2019... More \u2192 More News \u2192 Politely put: The people\u2019d do just find a different paper that endored who we voted and why! The paper\u2019\u2019d find a candida...",
        "Some of the country\u2019s most powerfu l leaders, policy and The letter, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, was signed by 370 economists, including eight Nobel Prize winners. The text stops short of endorsing Democrat Hillary Clinton, though, and doesn\u2019t criticize Trump on ideological grounds.",
        "As Americans are getting ready to cast their votes for the next occupant of the White House, let\u2019s step back from the heated political debate to focus on an issue that should \u2014 even if it doesn\u2019t \u2014 bring people together: the state of our planet. I was in Rio de Janeiro last week, site of this year\u2019s Olympics. I grew up there, and was immensely proud of the spectacular success of the games. Despite the extreme negativity of media reports, the city came through and offered quite a show for the world to enjoy.",
        "Deals, deals and more deals \u2014 corporations are on a merger binge. But are they helping or hurting the economy? In the short run, mergers can hurt workers, consumers and savers. But most economists say that in the long run, consolidation can increase efficiency and strengthen U. S. corporations, helping the economy for all. Let\u2019s walk through recent events, and consider the arguments. In October, corporations announced about $329 billion worth of deals, according to Thomson Reuters\u2019 calculations.",
        "Lots of people think this is how science works: A genius sits in a lab working late into the night and, finally \u2014 \u201dEureka!\u201d After that come big prizes, and maybe even lucrative patents, right? Discoveries are rarely so straightforward. A recent biotech advance that goes by the long, awkward acronym of is a perfect case. It\u2019s a process that makes editing DNA seem as easy as fixing typos in an email, thanks to a molecule that cuts up DNA like a pair of scissors.",
        "Like many people, I absolutely cherish the close friendships I forged in college, nearly years ago. But we rarely think about how these friendships might affect the path to graduation. If anything, students are typically advised to avoid social distractions and keep their eyes on the academic prize instead. A new book from a researcher at Dartmouth College puts a new spin on that idea, mapping out the ways differently structured social networks affect students\u2019 experiences for good and for ill.",
        "It\u2019s about 11 p. m. and Raxabago Police Station No. 1 is busy. And hot. The air conditioner over the door is failing miserably. The station is in Tondo, Manila\u2019s most densely populated district, and home to some of the city\u2019s most notorious slums. And in the wake of President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s war on narcotics, suspected drug users and dealers find themselves jailed in growing numbers. \u201dIt depends on the operation. Sometimes there are 10, sometimes more, sometimes 20,\u201d says Chief Inspector Robinson Maranion. And that has created a problem.",
        "A bomb goes off. It\u2019s noisy. It\u2019s smoky. Lights are flashing, people are shouting. The wounded are bloody and dying. But this isn\u2019t a real war zone. It\u2019s a training class inside a simulator in San Antonio that recreates the chaos and pressure of combat. Thousands of U. S. military medics, corpsmen ad technicians are deployed around the world \u2014 from war zones to hospitals and clinics. And in the last five years, nearly all these workers have trained at the Medical Education and Training campus at Fort Sam Houston.",
        "Amnesty International said Wednesday that Russian authorities have closed off its Moscow office. The human rights group\u2019s Europe and Central Asia director, John Dalhuisen, called it \u201dan unwelcome surprise for which we received no prior warning.\u201d When staffers arrived for work Wednesday morning, they found a seal over the door declaring that they were not allowed to enter without a city official.",
        "For many Missouri health advocates, an increase in the state\u2019s tobacco tax is long overdue. But onlookers might be surprised to hear that tobacco companies are spending a fortune this election year to get one or another increase in that tax passed, while health groups are urging a no vote. At 17 cents for a pack of cigarettes, Missouri\u2019s tax is the lowest in the country \u2014 a fraction of what you\u2019d pay in many states. New York\u2019s tax is the highest at $4.",
        "A report out this morning from Australian investigators offers a handful of new clues about the greatest aviation mystery of the 21st century: the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Based on a fresh satellite analysis and debris found on beaches along the African coast and several small islands, Australian investigators say they now believe the aircraft plunged rapidly into the southern Indian Ocean. The scenario might help answer questions about the plane\u2019s final minutes, but does little to explain its disappearance. Flight 370 vanished in March 2014 during a routine flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.",
        "It\u2019s that time again: time for Americans to figure out how, exactly, their presidential election works. \u201dElectoral College\u201d searches spike every four years, just before Election Day, according to Google . .. and the search volume is picking up right now. Long story short: To win the presidency, you don\u2019t have to win the majority of the popular vote. You have to win the majority of electoral votes \u2014 that is, 270 of them.* In most states, a candidate wins electoral votes by winning the most voters. So.",
        "A week away from Election Day, Democrats still have multiple paths to winning back the Senate. Meanwhile, Republicans are hoping that new revelations about possible new Hillary Clinton emails related to her private server can only bolster the \u201dcheck and balance\u201d argument they need to make for voters to separate their GOP candidates from the top of the ticket. Overall, the Senate landscape looks largely unchanged from a week ago. Illinois is all but gone \u2014 made worse by a gaffe from Sen. Mark Kirk. Wisconsin could be tighter than once thought, though Democratics still have an edge.",
        "When news broke Friday that the FBI had discovered emails that might be pertinent to its investigation of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, stock prices suddenly took a tumble. The decline can be explained by an unusual development in this year\u2019s long, contentious presidential campaign, says Eric Zitzewitz, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College.",
        "Whether it\u2019s an IUD, a shot, an implant, or a daily pill, birth control is a regular part of many adult women\u2019s lives. It has left a lot of women asking: Why not men? For years, people have tried to create birth control for men. The World Health Organization commissioned what sounded like a promising trial, a injection designed to lower sperm count. Initial results looked like it would be 96 percent effective in preventing pregnancy in the participants\u2019 partners.",
        "With just days until the election, some Senate Republicans are suggesting that when it comes to the Supreme Court, eight is enough. Eight justices, that is. For the first time, some Senate Republicans are saying that if Hillary Clinton is elected, the GOP should prevent anyone she nominates from being confirmed to fill the current court vacancy, or any future vacancy. The pronouncements are such a break with history and tradition that they often provoke the response, \u201dReally?\u201d Some see such statements as little more than an attempt to motivate the Republican base to get out and vote.",
        "One mutation. A simple tweak in the Ebola gene \u2014 a C got turned into a T. That\u2019s all it took to make Ebola more infectious during the West Africa epidemic, scientists report Thursday. Two studies, published in the journal Cell, found that a single mutation arose early in the epidemic. It allows Ebola to infect human cells more easily than the original version of the virus \u2014 way more easily.",
        "The last time Melania Trump was in the spotlight, it did not end well. After her address at the Republican National Convention in July, it was discovered that several lines from Trump\u2019s speech were lifted from a Michelle Obama speech at the 2008 Democratic Convention. The plagiarism scandal led to online ridicule \u201d her speech writer accepted responsibility saying that Trump had read passages of Obama\u2019s speech to her, which she then wrote down and included in the speech.",
        "One of Donald Trump\u2019s most ardent supporters in Silicon Valley allegedly told two of his classmates at Stanford that he thought South Africa\u2019s former apartheid system of government was \u201da sound economic system.\u201d On Thursday, through a spokesperson, Thiel denied ever having supported apartheid. In a blog post on Medium, Julie wrote that she was a dorm mate with now Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel at Stanford in . wrote that Thiel told her that \u201dmoral issues were irrelevant\u201d to the racist government\u2019s economy.",
        "The FBI has opened a civil rights investigation into the vandalizing and burning of a black church in Mississippi. \u201dVote Trump\u201d had been on a wall. Local authorities are still searching for the person or people responsible for the fire, which they have identified as an arson. \u201dWhen firefighters arrived at Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church Tuesday night, they found it in flames, and the \u2019Vote Trump\u2019 slogan written in silver spray paint on the outside wall of the church,\u201d Mark Rigsby of Mississippi Public Broadcasting reports.",
        "Last year, the Texas legislature approved a $350 million cut in Medicaid reimbursement rates to early childhood intervention therapists and providers. The cuts, made to help balance a billion dollars in property tax relief, affect the most vulnerable Texas children \u2014 those born extremely prematurely or with Down syndrome or other genetic conditions that put them at risk for developmental delay. For months, providers of physical, speech and occupational therapies have continued to serve children who have disabilities, despite mounting financial losses.",
        "Is it the dessert topping that eats like a spread, or the spread that can also be a dessert topping? That\u2019s a question the U. S. government is asking about Nutella, the chocolate and hazelnut treat, in a new request for comments. The answer could cut the number of calories and fat listed on Nutella\u2019s nutritional labels in half. The disparity stems from how the Food and Drug Administration lists two classes of foods.",
        "By the time a group of high school students showed up at Richard Moss\u2019 home in 1980, he was an old man in his 80s. He was a master of singing \u2014 a remarkable old style of music he learned from his elders, who learned it from their elders in the mountains of northern Georgia. The students wanted to document the tradition for their magazine, Foxfire.",
        "Note: NPR\u2019s First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the Spotify playlist at the bottom of the page. There\u2019s a point in every party where things start to come unglued. The hour is in doubt. Revelry dissolves into a disjointed blur. Altered states of consciousness have begun to fade, but the ground hasn\u2019t yet rushed up to break the fall. Jessica Rabbit is the sound of that limbo. The fourth album by the duo known as Sleigh Bells, it\u2019s a testament to the power of a celebration gone weird.",
        "Note: NPR\u2019s First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. Before he began the tour that\u2019s documented on the set The 1966 Live Recordings, Bob Dylan was on record as being ambivalent about the road. His electric adventure had started months earlier, with a short, sonically flawed performance at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. The move to electric guitar and a rock backing band brought praise from some quarters and howling derision and doubting criticism from others.",
        "As a home to one of the nation\u2019s largest populations of Middle Eastern immigrants, the Detroit area is a natural destination for refugees fleeing violence in places like Syria. But the leader of the largely suburban county that neighbors the city has called for a stop to these refugee resettlements. That has become a hot issue in the race for that county\u2019s executive. Longtime Oakland County Executive L. Brooks Patterson typically wins by big margins. He\u2019s one of Michigan\u2019s Republican officeholders.",
        "Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin issued a presidential decree Thursday that grants Russian citizenship to star Steven Seagal, fulfilling a desire that Seagal spoke about as recently as September. Putin and Seagal are longtime friends. Putin and Seagal share a passion for martial arts: Seagal is an expert in aikido, and Putin is an expert in judo. They\u2019ve appeared together at martial arts demonstrations and official events, including last year\u2019s Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok. In recent years, Seagal has emerged as an unlikely conduit between U. S. and Russian officials. Back in 2013, members of a U. S.",
        "There\u2019s a seductive idea, currently being for how to stop the world\u2019s forests from disappearing. It relies on big food companies. That\u2019s because most forests are being cleared in order to grow crops or graze cattle. And the resulting palm oil, soybeans or beef find their way into foods being sold by a relatively small number of global companies. So here\u2019s the strategy: Get those companies to boycott products from deforested land, and much of the economic incentive to clear more forests will disappear. This should slow down or even stop the loss of forests.",
        "The title Loving may seem a rough fit for a movie made by Jeff Nichols, whose previous work includes Take Shelter and Mud. But Richard and Mildred Loving were the names of the couple who inspired his new film in the late 1950s they were forbidden to love and marry by the state of Virginia.",
        "The United States could potentially elect its first female president in less than a week. And if Hillary Clinton does win, subsequent Democratic gains in Congress could also usher a record number of women into the House and Senate. \u201dIf what is going on at the top of the ticket drives a big turnout for Democratic candidates, then Democratic women will fare well who are running down ballot,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University\u2019s Eagleton Institute of Politics."
