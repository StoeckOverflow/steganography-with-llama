        "The reclusive leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr has purportedly issued an audio message calling on his fighters to stand firm in Mosul, as Iraqi security forces enter the city for the first time since ISIS seized it more than two years ago. The message could not be independently verified, but if authentic, it would be Baghdadi\u2019s \u201dfirst audio message released in nearly a year,\u201d Reuters reports.

        "How do you judge how good a school is? Test scores? Culture? Attendance? In the new federal education law, states are asked to use five measures of student success. The first four are dictated by the Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA. Three are related to academics \u2014 like annual tests and graduation rates. The fourth measures proficiency of English language learners. The fifth is the wild card \u2014 aimed at measuring \u201dstudent success or school quality\u201d \u2014 and the law leaves it to states to decide.",

He says he regularly gets detention for being tardy. \u201dI get to school and I\u2019m talked to like I\u2019m attempting to skip school \u2014 like I\u2019m attempting to be truant,\u201d he says. \u201dI feel terrible.

        "Last month, Australian surfer Jade Fitzpatrick sustained three bite wounds to his thigh from a great white shark as he waited for a wave on his surfboard off the north coast of New South Wales. As the Guardian newspaper reported, he was helped out of the water by a friend, received medical treatment and planned to surf again in the same waters within 10 days. What struck me about this report was Fitzpatrick\u2019s calm and compassionate attitude about the whole event.",

        "A British court has ruled that the U. K. government must get approval from Parliament in order to initiate the country\u2019s departure from the European Union. The High Court\u2019s decision is a blow to the government\u2019s plans for how to trigger a \u201dBrexit.\u201d But it\u2019s been good news for the pound, which swiftly rose to a high.

        "A few years ago, the Urban Institute undertook a massive experiment to measure discrimination in home rentals and sales. The researchers sent hundreds of people in dozens of cities across the country to act as applicants trying to rent or buy apartments and houses. The \u201dtesters\u201d were given similar credit histories and financial qualifications. What the researchers they found was sobering: almost everywhere they tested, black folks, Latinos, and Asian Americans were shown significantly fewer homes than were white applicants, and they were less likely to be offered discounts on their rent.",
        "One of Hillary Clinton\u2019s oft repeated attack lines against Donald Trump is that he\u2019s \u201da man you can bait with a tweet.\u201d It\u2019s now clear her campaign has been purposely baiting the Republican nominee with television ads. \u201dYou know, he was a big part of our target audience.

        "The presidential election looks very different from the heights of the economy than it does from its depths. In North Carolina, rural Bertie County, the poorest in the state, and tech hub Wake County, the most prosperous, are less than two hours apart by car in this important presidential swing state. And yet they could almost be on opposite sides of the world. Charlotte Gilliam, a resident of Bertie, says the difference between there and Wake is \u201dfrom here to China.\u201d One county represents an older, more traditional vision of America.",

        "Sometimes called India\u2019s veggie burger, vada pav is indeed just as iconic in Mumbai, the city of its origin, as the burger is in America.

        "Before I talk about the new historical film Loving from Jeff Nichols, I have to confess: I don\u2019t usually enjoy civil rights movies. Don\u2019t get me wrong, as a descendant of slaves, I fully appreciate the civil rights movement itself. It\u2019s just a tough genre to pull off artistically. It\u2019s far too easy for these films to succumb to squinting at the heavens. What many films based on historical events lack is the uncertainty of the moment they\u2019re trying to reproduce \u2014 the doubt of outcome, the insecurity about the effectiveness of the strategy being utilized.",

        "History could be made in next week\u2019s election \u2014 not only in the possibility of electing the first female president, but in the possibility of the largest gender voting gap in the modern era.
