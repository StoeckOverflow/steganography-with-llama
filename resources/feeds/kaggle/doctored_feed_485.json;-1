These are the moments when everything seems to click, and people leap forward into their careers. In December 1984, a war was raging in Afghanistan millions of refugees were fleeing to Pakistan to escape the fighting. National Geographic photographer Steve McCurry was there \u2014 stationed at the border to cover the crisis. \u201dThere were, in some cases, tens of thousands of Afghans pressed together in these squalid, really terrible conditions,\u201d McCurry says.",
        "For years, medical interns have been limited to working no more than 16 hours without a break to minimize the chances they would make mistakes while fatigued. But that restriction could soon be eased. The group that sets the rules for medical residents proposed scrapping the limit for interns, doctors in their first year of training after finishing medical school. The new rule would let these new doctors work for as many as 28 hours at a stretch.",
        "When the presidential candidates debated last month for the second time, Donald Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton once laughed at a victim of rape. The allegation stems from a case that Clinton worked as a young lawyer in 1975 \u2014 she defended one of two men accused of raping Kathy Shelton. Trump featured Shelton in a press conference that was broadcast on Facebook Live ahead of the debate and then brought her in to sit with the audience.",
        "The surprise acquittal of Ammon Bundy and six other militants who occupied a bird sanctuary in Oregon last January has emboldened the movement\u2019s militia followers, who claim the federal government has no right to own public land. \u201dWe\u2019re fighting for our freedoms, for our rights to keep our Constitution,\u201d said defendant Shawna Cox, outside a federal court in Portland last week. Reiterating a popular refrain of the Bundys and their sympathizers, Cox said the federal government has no constitutional right to own millions of acres of public land in the West.",
        "San Francisco Bay Area companies say Sutter Health is them into a contract that would help the hospital system secure its power over prices and potentially raise the cost of medical care for their employees in the future. Dozens of companies have received a letter, via their insurance administrators, asking them to waive their rights to sue Sutter. If they don\u2019t, a fact sheet included in the letter says, the companies\u2019 employees who get care through Sutter\u2019s network of hospitals, doctors and medical services will no longer have access to discounted prices.",
        "Desmond Doss is credited with saving 75 soldiers during one of the bloodiest battles of World War II in the Pacific \u2014 and he did it without ever carrying a weapon. The battle at Hacksaw Ridge, on the island of Okinawa, was a close combat fight with heavy weaponry. Thousands of American and Japanese soldiers were killed, and the fact that Doss survived the battle and saved so many lives has confounded and awed those who know his story. Now, he\u2019s the subject of a new film directed by Mel Gibson called Hacksaw Ridge.",
        "Filmmaker Mel Gibson has two obsessions: grisly violence and martyrdom. Hacksaw Ridge, his new World War II film, splits its 140 minutes between the two of them almost (or ). It\u2019s good, in a sturdy, muted, unsurprising way. But as a platform for his directorial comeback after a decade in movie jail \u2014 let\u2019s just say the lull was entirely his own fault and leave it there \u2014 it\u2019s brilliant.",
        "When it comes to Hillary Clinton\u2019s historic run for the presidency, if she\u2019s ultimately able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling it will be because a combination of good luck and better planning helped her overcome challenges, many of her own making. Donald Trump\u2019s name is on the ballot, but Clinton\u2019s biggest opponent may well have been herself \u2014 as she was dogged by emails, questions over the Clinton Foundation and paid speeches. Those controversies have kept the presidential contest between Clinton and Republican nominee Trump close at the end.",
        "When Donald Trump decided to run for president \u2014 after flirting with politics for many years, and gaining a following on the right for questioning President Obama\u2019s birthplace \u2014 the real estate developer and businessman from Queens was dismissed and laughed at by political observers. Many largely wrote the whole thing off as a publicity stunt. But Trump\u2019s astonishing rise to the Republican nomination was marked by an aura of invincibility unlike any politician in memory.",
        "Reversing a appeals court ruling, the U. S. Supreme Court says Arizona can enforce its law banning the collection of ballots by political campaigners. The ruling means that in Arizona, the practice that critics call \u201dballot harvesting\u201d will be a felony in Tuesday\u2019s election. The law was enacted earlier this year since then, it\u2019s been in a between Republicans and Democrats \u2014 as on Friday, when the 9th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted to block the law. Today\u2019s ruling changes that.",
        "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Friday that she plans to vote in favor of legalizing recreational marijuana in California. \u201dI will vote for it, but I have not made a public statement about it until right this very second,\u201d Pelosi, who represents the district that serves San Francisco, told the editorial board and reporters at the Los Angeles Times. Pelosi\u2019s stance on the issue makes her one of the highest ranking politicians in a relatively small group openly supporting legalization of the drug for recreational use. It\u2019s more common for lawmakers to support its medical use.",
        "David Strickroth does steady business at High Impact Tactical Firearms in Upland, Calif. It\u2019s a small shop, as gun shops go, with several dozen firearms hanging on the olive green walls and sitting in a glass display case below. He typically sells one or two guns a day. Recently, though, things have picked up: \u201dNow I\u2019m selling six or seven a day,\u201d Strickroth says. The reason?",
        "Concerns about the possible hacking of voting systems on Election Day are growing. 46 states have asked the U. S. Department of Homeland Security to help make sure their systems are protected from disruptions on Tuesday. And some states, like Ohio, are taking steps on their own. Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, a Republican, says his state worked with \u201dall available public and private cyber security experts\u201d to test Ohio\u2019s voting systems, including a cybersecurity unit at the state\u2019s National Guard. Husted says the guard unit was invited to come in and test the system for vulnerabilities.",
        "At the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, as a Sioux tribe fights the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, the standoff has raised a question: How do you feed the encamped masses? For Navajo chef Brian Yazzie, the answer was clear: in a way that honors indigenous traditions. Yazzie is the chef du cuisine at The Sioux Chef, a catering and food education company whose mission is to revitalize Native American food culture, which was marginalized by centuries of colonization and forced assimilation.",
        "Maybe the smart phone\u2019s hegemony makes perfect evolutionary sense: Humans are tapping a deep urge to seek out information. Our ancient survival instinct has evolved into an obsession one that prompts many of us today to constantly check our phones and multitask. Monkey see. Click. Swipe. Reward. A new book The Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in a High Tech World explores the implications of, and brain science behind, this evolution (some might say devolution). It was written Adam Gazzaley, a neurologist and a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, and research psychologist Larry D. Rosen.",
        "Ian Brennan wanted to make a record with music performed by prisoners. He\u2019s a record producer who likes to bring attention to the voices of people who aren\u2019t usually heard. So when he heard that a prison in Malawi had a band, off he went to the maximum security facility. \u201dWe just took the leap of faith and went down there,\u201d says Brennan, a California native who has worked with artists like Ramblin\u2019 Jack Elliott and Bill Frisell and who now lives in Italy.",
        "Tippi Hedren played the beautiful blond woman that Alfred Hitchcock liked to put in peril \u2014 as in the famous scene in which she opens the door into a dark attic in The Birds, and is pecked by a flock of the title characters. Hedren survived the attic. But those birds weren\u2019t just stuffed props \u2014 and the real menace might have been the film\u2019s eminent director. After a life in films and animal activism, Hedren has written a memoir. It\u2019s called Tippi.",
        "I know baseball is not real life. While Chicago\u2019s streets teemed with loud whoops and waving banners as the Cubs won their first World Series in 108 years, 18 more people were killed over two days on the south and west sides of the city. The number of homicides in Chicago has surged past 600 this year. 2016 could be the city\u2019s deadliest year in nearly 20, and the people in those afflicted neighborhoods, usually a long way from Wrigley Field, will remember this year more for their losses than any World Series victory.",
        "When you root for a cursed sports team, you learn heartbreak \u2014 and superstition. I am a Bostonian and therefore spent most of my youth and middle age rooting with futility for the Red Sox, and pining for the day when the Curse of the Bambino would finally be purged. Most of my most acute memories of rooting for the Sox involve not disappointment, but decimation. I watched from an airport en route home from an assignment during what may have been the worst of these awful moments, the sixth game of the 1986 World Series against the Mets.",
        "Troll dolls, those novelty toys with fluorescent Don King hair, are now the stars of their own movie. It\u2019s a balance between fun and the kind of offbeat humor that aims to keep adults in their seats. Tending to these relentlessly charming creatures is veteran animator Mike Mitchell. He\u2019s worked with many different, er, species (a sponge, chipmunks, ogres) in his career. Mitchell claims Shrek is the most difficult of all of them. Trolls, he says, are by far the easiest. That\u2019s because Mitchell made all of these stubby little creatures \u2014 save one named Branch \u2014 extremely happy.",
        "Rome\u2019s Via Ramazzini is a residential street with a sprawling park that belongs to the Italian Red Cross. That\u2019s where newly arrived migrants are being sheltered in a tent camp. Outside on the sidewalk, three young African men say they\u2019re from Eritrea, here for the past two weeks after making a dangerous sea crossing. Yarid Hailah, 25, says his boat, with 190 people aboard, was filling up with water. Ten hours after they left Libya, they were rescued. \u201dNobody died,\u201d he says.",
        "In Egypt, Saturday nights are for staying in \u2014 the workweek starts on Sunday. But for the members of CaiRollers, Egypt\u2019s first roller derby team, it\u2019s for skating. The team\u2019s 20 members meet for three hours every week, at the Cairo International Stadium\u2019s outdoor handball courts, to practice. It\u2019s an aggressive game, requiring full body contact like hip and shoulder checks. But that\u2019s why players like Lina 27, love it. \u201dIt makes you believe that you\u2019re still able to learn at any age. It empowers you,\u201d she says.",
        "Updated at 7:46 p. m. ET, Following up on his letter that set off a firestorm of speculation just two weeks before U. S. voters head to the polls to choose a new president, FBI Director James Comey says the investigative team that analyzed a new trove of emails that were either to or from Hillary Clinton has finished its work \u2014 and that the review doesn\u2019t change the findings he put forth in July, when he said no charges will be pursued against Clinton.",
        "America is changing. It\u2019s getting browner, as population growth stagnates among whites. And Millennials, who now outnumber baby boomers, are poised to become the dominant political generation of the next 35 years beginning in this election. now make up a majority of kindergartners. By the next presidential election, the Census Bureau projects, they will be a majority of all children. And by 2044, no one racial group will be a majority of the country. 2016 could be the first election in which the white vote is at or below 70 percent as a share of the electorate.",
        "When a voter heads to the polls, any number of factors may influence how she casts her vote: party affiliation, her impression of the candidates \u2014 or even the design of the ballot itself. The visual layout of a ballot can have a surprising effect on a voter\u2019s decision. And anyone who recalls the 2000 presidential election, which drew national attention to some confusing elements of the Florida ballot, can tell you that designers don\u2019t always get it right. So, who are the people designing the ballots? That depends on where you\u2019re asking.",

The groups waging the campaign, Operation Wrath Of Euphrates, is U. S. and . Senior members of the rebel force proclaimed the start of the campaign this weekend in Ain Issa, a town about 35 miles north of Raqqa \u2014 halfway between the larger city and the Turkish border.

        "Here\u2019s a little information that Americans have usually been able to ignore. It\u2019s about the Electoral College, a uniquely American institution that\u2019s been with us from the beginning and that\u2019s occasionally given us fits. Typically, the Electoral College meets and does its thing a month or so after the election, and few people even notice or care. Once in a while, though, people do notice and do care \u2014 a lot. Will 2016 be one of those years? It\u2019s not something reasonable people would hope for, but it cannot be ruled out. First, the basics.",
        "Ralph Cicerone, a celebrated scientist and a driving force in the effort to put climate change on the global agenda, died Saturday at the age of 73. Cicerone had retired in June as president of the National Academy of Sciences.

        "In the late 1960s, a lot of popular music was about peace, love, and harmony \u2014 but at the same time, an altogether different sound was emanating from a house on State Street in Ann Arbor, Michigan. It came from The Stooges, a quartet made up of two brothers, Ron and Scott Asheton, their friend Dave Alexander and, of course, Jim Osterberg, better known as Iggy Pop. That incarnation of the band was but its impact lives on. The Stooges are the subject of a new documentary called Gimme Danger."
