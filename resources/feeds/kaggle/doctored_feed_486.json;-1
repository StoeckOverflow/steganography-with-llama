        "Sometimes my brain goes dull and nums my body into the dullness that is the doldron of existence and my life goes on like clock wort and it is bull snot boring! Then sometimes the brain gets to me and my head goes daz and the brain says: Hey you are bip-bip and you are dad. everybody lov! you can\u2019 be sad and sad. And it says you should go play some ska and it makes it happen because my head goes wigga mow, and it goes mug There are many books I love, but Anne Carson\u2019s make me reconsider my life. Her poems feel like anarchic rainfall, a fresh shower, an escape from the canyon.",
        "The story has been done before: A Western journalist visits the Old City, checks in at a swinging bar and churns out a dispatch about Syrians partying as the war rages on. At this moment, the world\u2019s attention is on the showdown in Aleppo. But after a string of sleepless nights preparing for a trip this week to Syria that appeared out of thin air, I was ready for a glass myself. My colleague and I entered the Syrian capital\u2019s Old City through an enormous stone gate and a checkpoint manned by paramilitaries.",
        "It looks like Surf City, USA: White sand beaches that stretch for miles, sunshine, a soft breeze and some pretty gnarly waves. But this is not California. It\u2019s the Gaza Strip. This coastal Palestinian territory is more famous for conflict with Israel. Visitors have to pass through military checkpoints to enter the strip, and Israeli drones often buzz overhead. There are piles of rubble from years of war. But Gaza also has a Mediterranean coast and a small local surf scene.",
        "The U. S. presidential election can\u2019t be \u201dhacked,\u201d authorities insist \u2014 but there are many other ways that a hostile nation could try to disrupt it. Leaders from the White House on down say that all the votes cast will be counted and that Americans will be able to trust the results. \u201dTo be clear: The equipment that people vote on is NOT connected to the Internet,\u201d the National Association of Secretaries of State wrote in an open letter to Congress.",
        "As Rep. Barbara Comstock marched in the Leesburg, Va. Halloween parade last week, she was trailed by massive trucks and buses decked out for Donald Trump. The coincidental staging by parade officials was also an unfortunate metaphor for the freshman Republican\u2019s campaign against Democratic nominee LuAnn Bennett as well. Despite touting her independence, denouncing her party\u2019s nominee and even being praised by The Washington Post editorial board as someone who could work across the aisle, the biggest hindrance to winning a second term for Comstock is her party\u2019s presidential nominee.",
        "Excruciating chest pain. Night sweats so severe he could ring out his sheets in the morning. A worsening cough. Getting out of breath when he walked his dogs \u2014 or tried to complete his regular run. Those were some of the symptoms that veterinarian Jonathan Cranston was feeling six weeks after returning home to England from a trip to South Africa, where he\u2019d been involved in a project that examined the stress level of wildebeests. At first he blamed the night sweats on his mattress.",
        "In what could be a tough election night for Republicans, governors\u2019 races may offer a rare bright spot. Unlike in House and Senate races, Democrats are largely playing defense in the 12 gubernatorial races on the ballot Tuesday. Democrats are defending eight seats to the GOP\u2019s four. Two states \u2014 North Dakota and Utah \u2014 will safely stay in the Republicans\u2019 column, while Democrats will keep Oregon, Washington and an open Delaware seat on their side. There are seven competitive races to watch, and six of those are firmly in the column.",
        "Dear Sugar Radio is a weekly podcast from member station WBUR. Hosts Steve Almond and Cheryl Strayed offer \u201dradical empathy\u201d and advice on everything from relationships and parenthood to dealing with drug problems or anxiety. Today the hosts think about friendships coming to an end, in differing ways. First, they consider the best option for distancing yourself from a friend with no \u201dcommon interests, morals or goals.\u201d Then the Sugars take on the intersection of friendships and relationships.",
        "State legislatures have become crucibles for some of the most controversial policies in recent years \u2014 voter ID laws, religious freedom bills, minimum wage hikes, gun control measures and more. And they\u2019re places where Republicans have had remarkable electoral success over the past six years. The GOP now controls a record 67 out of 98 partisan state legislative chambers (Nebraska has a unicameral nonpartisan legislature) while Democrats hold just 31. Republicans fully control legislatures in 22 states, while Democrats have control in eight 19 states have divided control of their legislatures.",
        "Republicans are feeling the best they have this cycle about their chances of holding their majority in the U. S. Senate, but doing that would require several states to break their way on election night. That\u2019s a risky place to be one day before control of the Senate is decided. The tightening of the presidential race over the past week may have had an impact on these Senate contests. Most of the contests remain firm though Democrats still have multiple paths to winning back the five seats they need (or just four if Democrat Hillary Clinton wins the presidency).",
        "Even if Hillary Clinton does win the White House on Tuesday, the tightening of the presidential race in the final week has been the most detrimental to Democrats\u2019 downballot hopes. In Clinton\u2019s campaign looked like it would easily cruise to a win. Then, rising ObamaCare premiums hit along with possible new emails that surfaced related to her private server. Subsequently, polls across the board began to show closer races.",
        "Election night is going to be information overload. We wanted to provide an guide of which counties to keep tabs on that could tell you how states might vote that are crucial to the election. So we took 15 of the states where this election has been hotly waged and identified one county in each that has gone with the winner or closely reflected the statewide margin in each. We tried to pick counties that had a large enough population to matter some \u2014 or if they just had a knack for picking that statewide winner.",
        "Finally. Election Day. It\u2019s almost here. The campaign that many thought would never end is ending tomorrow. Here\u2019s our handy guide to some things that the results will tell us \u2014 and why they matter for the future. Yes, the presidential race is very close, and some public polls show it getting closer as we go into the final hours, but in one sense it\u2019s actually been stable for months. Hillary Clinton has had a small but persistent lead since June \u2014 anywhere from 2 to 5 points.",
        "Being a parent is hard, even if you have a partner and a steady income (or two). Now, imagine doing that job solo. It\u2019s a trend that\u2019s risen steadily in the past few decades. In 1968, 85 percent of children were raised in families, according to U. S. Census data. By 2015, the share of U. S. kids in families with one parent had more than doubled, to 27 percent. In many (and ) families, the cost of day care is a heavy burden, creating anxiety for parents as they hustle to keep up with those costs.",
        "U. S. troops are making slow progress in their offensive aimed at retaking the Syrian city of Raqqa, the capital of the Islamic State. This comes as Iraqi forces, assisted by the U. S. report gains in their mission to capture Mosul, the most important ISIS stronghold in that country. The Syrian Defense Forces \u2014 a coalition led by Kurds that also includes Arab and Turkmen fighters \u2014 are trying to isolate Raqqa before attempting to take control of it. The SDF announced the start of the offensive on Sunday. It\u2019s backed by U. S.",
        "comedian Aparna Nancherla is having a great year, riding high on a TV comedy special, tour and a new album, Just Putting It Out There \u2014 all this while wrestling with some pretty tough personal issues, like depression, on stage. Nancherla\u2019s very dry sense of humor comes alive through her very expressive face, her dancing eyebrows and wide smile. She tells NPR\u2019s Audie Cornish that early in her career, someone told her she did standup like someone who\u2019d never seen standup before.",
        "This week a gigantic Pink Floyd box set is released. What\u2019s remarkable about Pink Floyd Early Years is that its 27 discs cover only the band\u2019s first seven years! All this week we\u2019ll think pink with some of the people who were there. On Friday \u2014 the day this collection is released \u2014 we\u2019ll talk with drummer Nick Mason about those early years. On Tuesday we talk to Roger Waters about his upcoming projects and politics. But I thought we should start with a man who, 50 years ago, witnessed and participated in those very early days.",
        "There may be nothing more American than mom and apple pie \u2014 but mom and cake come pretty close. Ask Anne Byrn, the author and baker whose romance with cake started when she was tall enough to reach for the box of Hershey\u2019s cocoa. \u201dCake is an icon of American culture,\u201d says Byrn, who has just published American Cake, a lavish tome layered with buttery pictures. \u201dBe it vanilla, lemon, ginger, chocolate, cinnamon, boozy, Bundt, layered or marbled \u2014 cake has a special hold on the American palate, imagination, and heart. Why?",
        "There were snowy, icy balls everywhere. Videos and photos from western Siberia, on the Gulf of Ob, showed an entire beach covered in snowballs that had apparently washed ashore. In one image published online by the Siberian Times, a woman sat on the frozen balls. In another, a dog ran near the balls, which had also formed what looked like a vertical mass of balls mashed together into an icy . The BBC reports that the balls started washing up about two weeks ago.",
        "The U. S. Justice Department says it will have more than 500 monitors and observers out Tuesday watching polling sites in 28 states. They\u2019ll be looking for any voting rights violations, such as whether voters are discriminated against because of their race or language. \u201dThe bedrock of our democracy is the right to vote, and the Department of Justice works tirelessly to uphold that right, not only on Election Day, but every day,\u201d Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement.",
        "A magnitude 5. 0 earthquake shook central Oklahoma on Sunday evening, damaging several buildings. Multiple aftershocks also hit the area, the U. S. Geological Survey says. The quake epicenter was about a mile west of the town of Cushing, the largest commercial crude oil storage center in North America and the southern terminus of the Keystone pipeline.",
        "Federal scientists have launched another test in human volunteers of a Zika vaccine. This one uses a more traditional approach than an experiment that started in August. Federal officials are eager to develop a vaccine as quickly as possible, which is why they are pursuing multiple approaches. This experimental vaccine, called ZPIV, has already proved effective when designed to target a virus similar to Zika, called Japanese encephalitis.",
        "It hasn\u2019t been easy for journalists covering the 2016 presidential race. While doing their jobs, they\u2019ve had to confront unprecedented threats, abuse, bans and accusations of conspiracy and bias. Journalists from other countries who are covering the election have confronted their own set of challenges. The foreign press corps is low on the food chain during any U. S. presidential race, and perhaps never more so than this one. Since foreign journalists\u2019 audiences rarely include U. S. voters, campaigns don\u2019t consider them a priority. Access, particularly to Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, has been a challenge and a source of frustration.",
        "Janet Reno, the first woman to serve as attorney general of the United States, died early Monday from complications of Parkinson\u2019s disease. Reno\u2019s goddaughter Gabrielle D\u2019Alemberte and sister Margaret Hurchalla confirmed her passing to NPR. Reno spent her final days at home in Miami surrounded by family and friends, D\u2019Alemberte told The Associated Press. She was 78. Reno served longer in the job than anyone had in 150 years. And her tenure was marked by tragedy and controversy. But she left office widely respected for her independence and accomplishments.",
        "It\u2019s been hard to find voices of hope this election season. People seem to feel they\u2019re choosing between the lesser of two evils. Not E. J. Johnson: \u201dThis is mostly, one of the mostly, thrilling things I\u2019ve ever done!\u201d She isn\u2019t talking about voting, though, because she won\u2019t be able to do that for another eight years or so. E. J. is in fifth grade. Her enthusiasm is for getting out the vote at the University of Colorado, Boulder.",
        "Millions of Americans will cast a vote for the next president of the United States on Nov. 8 \u2014 Election Day \u2014 and for countless other offices and propositions. In case you need the extra encouragement, here are three (more) reasons to vote, courtesy of the social sciences: 1. Voting is rational. (Maybe.) In fact, there are heated debates over whether it\u2019s rational to vote. On the one hand, voting is effortful: There is time and energy involved.",
        "You see \u201dnudging\u201d all of the time at the grocery store, but you probably don\u2019t realize it. Think of soda stacked in a pyramid near the register, or tortilla chips and salsa placed at the end of an aisle. \u201dNudging\u201d \u2014 a sales tactic that tries to make food look more appealing and easy to reach \u2014 encourages people to buy something. And as several food banks around the country have been learning, the tactic works well. Sharing Life Community Outreach in Mesquite, Texas, looks more like a small grocery store than a food pantry.",
        "Election Day is nearly upon us. So where does the electoral map stand? It\u2019s a close race, with Hillary Clinton retaining a broad and consistent but shallow advantage, according to the final NPR Battleground Map. Compared with a couple of weeks ago, when Clinton hit her peak lead, the race has tightened. So our map reflects that \u2014 almost all of the moves benefit Trump, though because of one potentially determinative move, Clinton still surpasses the 270 electoral votes needed to be president with just the states in which she\u2019s favored.",
        "China has ruled that two newly elected Hong Kong lawmakers who insulted the mainland and didn\u2019t swear allegiance while taking their oaths of office won\u2019t be able to retake the oaths, which means they won\u2019t be able to take office. Beijing announced its decision Monday, by which point there had already been widespread protests against the mainland\u2019s intervention. On Sunday night, after the Chinese government signaled it would be stepping into the matter, thousands of protesters took to the streets of Hong Kong, NPR\u2019s Rob Schmitz reports.",
        "A nearly weeklong strike by Philadelphia transit workers is ending, just in time for Election Day. Partial service will resume today, with full service on Tuesday, the transit authority said in a statement. Bus, trolley and subway lines had been shut down since Tuesday. Early this morning, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority and the Transport Workers Union Local 234 said they\u2019d managed to come to an tentative agreement. \u201dAfter negotiating through the night, officials from Philadelphia\u2019s transit authority and its largest union announced a deal ending the strike,\u201d Jim Saksa of member station WHYY reports."
