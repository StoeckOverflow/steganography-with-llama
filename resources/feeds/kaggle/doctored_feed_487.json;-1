        "As if the presidential cronyism scandal gripping South Korea couldn\u2019t get any more it turns out the shadowy ties between Korea\u2019s future president and a shaman were actually dramatized in a Korean or \u201d\u201d in the 1990s. The story of President Park \u2019s ties to a mysterious family with unorthodox and varied religious links is riveting South Korea. It\u2019s led to calls for her ouster and the lowest approval ratings of any president since the country democratized in 1987.",
        "A political scandal on a scale that South Korea has never seen is putting the president\u2019s job in jeopardy. A public opinion survey released Tuesday shows President Park \u2019s approval rating at 10 percent, an unprecedented low. Over the weekend, as many as 30, 000 South Koreans flooded into Seoul\u2019s downtown to rally for her resignation. All of this is over Park\u2019s reliance on a spiritual adviser, Choi who may have been meddling in state affairs.",
        "Since the laughing gas been used for pain relief, but these days it\u2019s usually associated with a visit to the dentist. In the early 20th century, women used laughing gas to ease the pain of labor, but its use declined in favor of more potent analgesia. Now a small band of midwives is helping to revive its use in the U. S. One hospital in Rhode Island, South County Hospital in South Kingstown, has just added nitrous oxide, the formal name for laughing gas, to its menu of pain relief options for labor.",
        "Thousands of soccer fans chant and beat drums in the stands. An announcer narrates, on live radio, the start of the match. Players from Gaza\u2019s top soccer league sprint and dive for the ball. Going for a header, two players collide \u2014 and one lands on the leg of the other. What happens next has never happened in Gaza before: A woman in a pink Muslim headscarf dashes out from the sidelines. She\u2019s there to treat the player whose leg was injured.",
        "In Greensboro, N. C. Eyeisha Holt spends her days as a child care worker at Head Start. But after a decade\u2019s work in early education she still earns only $11. 50 an hour \u2014 barely enough, she says, to cover the basics as a single mom of two. So every weekday evening she heads to her second job, as a babysitter. \u201dAre you ready to go to bed?\u201d she asks, as she oversees bath time for her daughter and another of her charges.",
        "As America goes to the polls, NPR\u2019s politics team brings you     results, news, analysis and views from around the country.",
        "Aside from the cliches that it all comes down to turnout and that the only poll that counts is the one on Election Day, one more truism that talking heads will repeat endlessly Tuesday is that demographics are destiny. It may make you want to throw a shoe at the TV (or radio) but (as they say) cliches are cliches for a reason. Breaking the electorate into these smaller chunks tells a lot about what people like and dislike about a candidate, not to mention how a rapidly changing electorate is changing the fundamentals of U. S. presidential politics.",
        "The day that everyone has been talking about is finally here. While millions of Americans have already cast their ballots in states, the majority of votes will be cast today. NPR will have live results as polls close at 7 p. m. ET right here on NPR. org and on your local NPR station. Not sure where to find your polling location? Google has made it easy with its polling place locator feature. Simply type \u201dwhere do I vote\u201d in Google\u2019s search engine, and you\u2019ll be able to find your polling location after typing in your home address.",
        "Polls are not the only place people look to for guidance to Election Day outcomes. Lots of people believe in bellwethers. The first two things to know about bellwethers is that there\u2019s no letter \u201da\u201d in the word, and bellwethers don\u2019t have anything to do with predicting the weather. The name refers to the neutered rams that shepherds use to guide flocks in the right direction. The wether trots along when the shepherd calls, the bell at his neck jangles, and the other sheep come ambling after him.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s path relies on winning traditionally Democratic states and has several potential ways over the top. Donald Trump has a much narrower path \u2014 he has to run the table in states and break through in a state that currently leans toward Clinton. Here are seven ways Election Day could play out: 1. The Blue Wall holds: There are 18 states, plus Washington, D. C. that have gone for Democrats in each of the past six presidential elections. Those add up to 242 electoral votes.",
        "As if our collective blood pressure weren\u2019t already today, a video showing a marine iguana hatchling chased by a pit of snakes is setting the Internet on fire. It\u2019s the \u201dfirst time snakes have been filmed hunting en masse,\u201d according to the BBC. Take a look: We wouldn\u2019t want to spoil the ending to this chase, which was filmed on an uninhabited island in the Galapagos. But it\u2019s fair to say that the odds are stacked against the tiny iguana as he faces what appear to be dozens of stealthy, hungry snakes.",
        "Writer and actress Issa Rae is upfront about the fact that she doesn\u2019t always fit in. She tells Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross that she was so socially uncomfortable and introverted growing up that one day she wrote the phrase \u201dI\u2019m awkward. And black\u201d in her journal, and it was a revelatory moment. \u201dI knew I was black, obviously, but the \u2019awkward\u2019 part really just defined me in a sense,\u201d Rae says.",
        "I\u2019ve noticed two distinct ways social media have changed the way we talk to each other about politics. Clearly, they have changed a lot, maybe everything, but two fairly new phenomena stand out. One happens on Facebook all the time. Just about all of your friends are posting about the election, nonstop.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s campaign released his final campaign video on Friday. It began with ominous piano music playing under one of Trump\u2019s speeches. As he condemns the \u201dcorrupt political establishment,\u201d grainy archive footage of his opponent Hillary Clinton and world leaders is mixed with stern, disappointed faces of everyday Americans. \u201dI\u2019m doing this for the people and the movement,\u201d Trump is heard saying to a cheering crowd. \u201dWe will take back this country for you and we will make America great again.\u201d The video is also generous with footage of his crowded rallies.",
        "On this Election Day, Secretary of State John Kerry is traveling just about as far from Washington, D. C. as he can go. He\u2019s on his way to Antarctica, becoming the first secretary of state to visit all seven continents after logging well over a million miles while in office. Kerry is visiting McMurdo Station, a U. S. research center in the Ross Sea \u2014 and, yes, the South Pole, too. His spokesman, John Kirby, says the purpose is to talk to researchers and scientists before he joins climate change talks in Morocco on Nov. 15.",
        "Speaking in North Carolina on the final day of the presidential campaign, Republican nominee Donald Trump urged voters to go to the polls and deliver an Election Day upset. \u201dIt\u2019s going to be Brexit plus, plus, plus,\u201d he said Monday, referring to the surprise victory in last June\u2019s referendum in which the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. Trump has drawn parallels between the U. K.\u2019s landmark vote to split with the EU and the success of his unconventional, run for the White House. Political observers here in the U. K.",
        "The cemetery where women\u2019s suffrage activist Susan B. Anthony is buried extended its hours Tuesday \u201dto accommodate those wishing to celebrate their vote\u201d at her gravesite. Mount Hope Cemetery in Rochester, N. Y. will be open until polls there close at 9 p. m. ET. Although this presidential election is the first in American history to have a woman on the ballot as a major party candidate, it is not the first time people have commemorated their votes by visiting Anthony\u2019s grave. Mount Hope Cemetery wrote on its Facebook page: \u201dIn past years, many Election Day visitors to Ms.",
        "Erik Vance didn\u2019t go to a doctor until he was 18 he grew up in California in a family that practiced Christian Science. \u201dFor the first half of my life, I never questioned the power of God to heal me,\u201d Vance writes in his new book, Suggestible You: Placebos, False Memories, Hypnosis, and the Power of Your Astonishing Brain. As a young man, Vance left the faith behind, but as he became a science journalist he didn\u2019t stop thinking about how people\u2019s beliefs and expectations affect their health, whether it\u2019s with placebo pills, mystical practices or treatments like acupuncture.",
        "Haiti on Tuesday launched the largest emergency cholera vaccination campaign ever attempted. The plan is to try to vaccinate 800, 000 people in parts of the country devastated by Hurricane Matthew. Immediately after the Category 4 storm tore across southwest Haiti last month, the number of reported cholera cases across the country shot up dramatically. In some areas it jumped tenfold. Nationwide, the number of new cases went from roughly 75 a day to well over 200.",
        "Nigeria is deploying 100 female police officers to protect women in displaced persons camps in the state of Borno, after a scathing Human Rights Watch report said officials, including security guards, have \u201draped and sexually exploited\u201d dozens of women.",
        "The highest court in the Philippines has voted to allow the body of the country\u2019s former dictator, Ferdinand Marcos, to be buried in the Heroes\u2019 Cemetery outside Manila. The court ruled 9 to 5 against a challenge that would have blocked the burial, brought by victims of Marcos\u2019s regime. As Michael Sullivan reports: \u201dMarcos still stirs deep feelings among many Filipinos.",
        "From pretty much the very start of this election season, Donald Trump grabbed the media by the press pass. He didn\u2019t even wait. As Trump, a former reality show host, once said in a slightly different context, \u201dWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it.\u201d This week, a wave of assessments of the media\u2019s performance during this presidential race has encouraged reporters and news outlets to take a bow, like award winners on Graduation Day.",
        "As voters go to the polls on Tuesday, the U. S. Supreme Court will be revisiting the 2008 collapse of the housing market, and the resulting drop in property values and property tax revenue. At issue are two cases testing whether Miami can sue Wells Fargo and Bank of America under the Fair Housing Act for alleged racial discrimination in mortgage terms and foreclosures. Specifically, the city of Miami alleges that the banks discriminated against black and Latino homeowners in terms and fees.",
        "Halloween has come and gone, but piles of candy remain. You have two options: Eat it all and risk a serious sugar coma, or get seriously creative with some science. We asked employees at various science museums what experiments they like to do with leftover candy. Get crackin\u2019. \u201dYour sense of taste is actually really limited,\u201d explains Julie Yu, senior scientist and director of the Teacher Institute at the Exploratorium in San Francisco.",
        "For decades, global trade has been transforming the world\u2019s economy, bringing Japanese and Korean cars to North American highways, U. S. software to European computers and German machine tools to Asian factories. But the days of explosive trade growth may be at an end. The dollar value of world merchandise (or ) exports fell from $19 trillion in 2014 to $16. 6 trillion last year, a decline of 13. 3 percent, according to the World Bank.",
        "Dr. James Heilman isn\u2019t an easy man to get hold of \u2014 he kept offering us odd, windows of availability to do a phone interview. When we finally connected, he explained: He works the night shift as an emergency room physician in British Columbia. He also puts in time as a clinical assistant professor in emergency medicine. And then there\u2019s the 60 \u2014 count \u2019em, 60! \u2014 hours a week he toils away editing Wikipedia, the massive online encyclopedia written and edited by, well, anyone who wants to give it a whirl.",
        "Ask a bunch of people why they don\u2019t get enough physical activity and you\u2019re likely to hear: \u201dI have no time.\u201d No wonder there\u2019s been so much hullabaloo about interval training, which alternates short bouts of relatively intense efforts with periods of recovery. Research suggests it can provide some of the benefits of longer, workouts in less time. A survey by the American College of Sports Medicine just ranked it as the third biggest fitness trend for 2017, behind wearable technology and training.",
        "While you\u2019re driving to your nearest polling station or waiting in line to vote, World Cafe\u2019s Talia Schlanger and WXPN\u2019s Bruce Warren weigh in with some of the greatest albums that have turned 18 this year.",
        "Before the opening of Vi Khi Nao\u2019s Fish in Exile, a married couple, Ethos and Catholic, lose their twin children in a terrible accident at the seashore. By the time the reader opens to the first page, they \u2014 and the book itself \u2014 have been fragmented by the event, and are trying and failing to hold themselves together. True to her name, Catholic embraces everything. She copes with action: going to work, having her tubes tied to prevent future pregnancies."
