        "At the end of October I received the email to let my fellow colleagers that my work would be closed. My heart dropped as my babymouse, my husband' who I was expecting was in Afghan at a remote outfit and I couldn\u2019 have been pridfer of my husband to get this letter, I would not want to see it happen for anybody and yet, for a moment it was a little me that was thinking \u201cwell maybe he would be the last man in that unit standing so if he survived this, would there",
        "It was Nov. 4, 2008. My birthday. Election Day. I made my way uptown to Harlem, where my friend Rakia was going to be watching the election returns with friends. I almost never wanted to go uptown \u2014 from Brooklyn, it may as well have been a trip to Guam \u2014 but that night I felt that I really, really needed to be in Harlem. There were about eight of us, all brown, posted up in Rakia\u2019s living room, eating pizza and tweeting and watching the news coverage. When CNN called the presidential race around 11 p. m.",
        "During his campaign, Donald Trump often was fuzzy on details of his economic plans. But he was clear about one goal: getting much tougher on trade relations with our most important partners, i. e. China, Canada and Mexico. Analysts say they don\u2019t doubt he will follow through. \u201dWe are definitely shifting to a world where the landscape is far less favorable to trade,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University. These are the three most likely steps to be taken in this new environment: Step 1: Kill TPP.",
        "Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States. That\u2019s remarkable for all sorts of reasons: He has no governmental experience, for example. And many times during his campaign, Trump\u2019s words inflamed large swaths of Americans, whether it was his comments from years ago talking about grabbing women\u2019s genitals or calling Mexican immigrants in the U. S. illegally \u201drapists\u201d and playing up crimes committed by immigrants, including drug crimes and murders. But right now, it\u2019s also remarkable because almost no one saw it coming.",
        "Democrats failed in their efforts to win back the Senate, but they did get a sliver of good news Wednesday evening after New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan was declared the winner over GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte. That victory brings Democrats\u2019 total pickups to just two \u2014 the Granite State and one in Illinois. The open Louisiana Senate race will be decided in a December runoff, but Republicans are favored there. In total, Democrats fell well short of what they needed.",
        "It was just a month ago that a leaked video of Donald Trump boasting about grabbing women\u2019s genitals without their consent led House Speaker Paul Ryan to say he would not defend the Republican presidential nominee or campaign with him. In the closing weeks of the election, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had all but disappeared from public view, saying at one point last month, \u201dI don\u2019t have any observations to make\u201d about the presidential race. What a difference winning an election makes.",
        "On Tuesday, more than 128 million people voted for our next president. Nearly half were elated with the results: a Donald Trump victory. Though he failed to win the popular vote, Trump won 29 states (as of this writing still waiting on Arizona and New Hampshire) and prevailed in key battleground states, including Ohio, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Exit polls show that a majority of white people \u2014 spanning all age ranges \u2014 voted for Trump. white people especially loved him.",
        "They traded compliments during the campaign. Those comments then became part of the campaign itself. And now that Donald Trump has won the U. S. presidential election, Russian President Vladimir Putin has congratulated him and raised the prospect of a fresh start in U. S. relations. In a telegram, the Russian leader said he was confident he and Trump could start \u201da constructive dialogue based on the principles of equality, mutual respect, and genuine consideration for each other\u2019s positions.\u201d He also expressed the hope that Trump would help resolve \u201dthe current crisis\u201d in U. S. relations.",
        "Voters in three cities in California passed ballot measures to place a one tax on sodas and other beverages, a move aimed at tackling obesity. In San Francisco, 62 percent of voters cast their ballots in favor of the tax on sugary drinks. Similar measures passed in Oakland and Albany, Calif. In addition, the city of Boulder, Colo. passed a 2 tax. \u201dThe growing worldwide movement to tax sugary beverages can no longer be stopped,\u201d wrote Harold Goldstein, executive director of Public Health Advocates in a release today.",
        "Hillary Clinton conceded the White House race to Donald Trump on Wednesday morning, saying she hoped \u201dhe will be a successful president for all Americans.\u201d \u201dThis is not the outcome we wanted or worked so hard for. I\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country,\u201d the Democratic nominee told supporters crowded into a small, nondescript ballroom at the New Yorker Hotel in Midtown Manhattan. It was a much different venue than the first major party female presidential nominee had planned.",
        "One of the most gracious moments in an election season is the concession speech given by the candidate who loses the presidency.",
        "President Obama, saying \u201dwe are all rooting for his success,\u201d vowed his staff would work as hard as it can to ensure a successful transition of power to Donald Trump. Obama spoke in the White House Rose Garden with Vice President Joe Biden at his side. The president had phoned Trump at 3:30 Wednesday morning to congratulate him on his upset victory over democrat Hillary Clinton, and invited Trump to the White House Thursday to discuss transition matters.",
        "When Donald Trump came down the escalator in June of 2015 in the tower he named for himself in Manhattan, few of us who do politics for a living took his announcement for president seriously. But the past 17 months have been a lesson to all of us who flattered ourselves \u2014 as campaign pros, polling pros and media pros \u2014 that we knew more about politics than he did. What have we learned? That Trump was being taken very seriously, indeed, by the people who ultimately mattered: voters. Not all the voters, surely.",
        "At 8 a. m. sharp, just hours after Donald Trump was declared the hallways at Harrisburg High\u2019s SciTech campus were buzzing. There were tears, but also a few subtle nods in approval of the results. But mostly the students expressed their deep desire for Americans here in Pennsylvania and around the country to come together. In Berkley, Calif. students at Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School needed to talk it out, too. \u201dIt\u2019s definitely going to be a big change,\u201d says Jackson, a . \u201dNot necessarily a good change or a bad one.",
        "Republicans will hold on to control of the Senate, according to Associated Press projections. The GOP defied the odds in a year in which it was almost entirely on defense and rode a wave that carried Donald J. Trump to the White House. Even with their best opportunities to gain seats in years, Democrats so far have only been able to pick up deep blue Illinois. And they narrowly hung on in Nevada, which was Republicans\u2019 only offensive opportunity.",
        "There\u2019s an expression in French, \u201dJamais deux sans trois,\u201d or \u201dNever two without three.\u201d After Brexit and Trump, will Marine Le Pen be next? France holds its presidential election next spring, and Le Pen, the leader of the country\u2019s National Front party, could well be one of the top two candidates in the first round of voting, which would propel her to the runoff in May 2017. But she hasn\u2019t been seriously considered as a candidate who could actually become president. Until now.",
        "The Afghan woman who famously appeared on the cover of National Geographic is back in her native country after being deported from Pakistan, where she had resided for more than three decades. Afghanistan\u2019s president, Ashraf Ghani, welcomed the return of Sharbat Gula at a ceremony held at the presidential palace in Kabul on Wednesday. The memorable cover photo depicting Gula, at about 12 years old, was taken at a refugee camp in Pakistan in 1984. As NPR\u2019s Philip Reeves has reported, Gula has spent most of her life outside Afghanistan after her parents were killed in a Soviet airstrike.",
        "Donald Trump has promised over and over in recent months that he will repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare, when he reaches the White House. \u201dObamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it,\u201d Trump said at a debate last month. \u201dWe have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive.\u201d Now that Trump will move into the Oval Office in January, the question is whether he\u2019ll be able to completely repeal the law that has had an impact on every aspect of the U. S. health care system.",
        "Republicans have been vowing for six years now to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They have voted to do so dozens of times, despite knowing any measures would be vetoed by President Obama. But the election of Donald Trump as president means Republican lawmakers wouldn\u2019t even have to pass repeal legislation to stop the health law from functioning. Instead, President Trump could do much of it with a stroke of a pen.",

        "California voters rejected a ballot measure that would have abolished the death penalty, and narrowly approved a competing measure designed to streamline the execution process. Proposition 62, which was opposed by about 56 percent of voters, would have repealed the death penalty for murder and replaced it with life in prison without parole. On the other hand, supporters of Proposition 66 campaigned under the slogan \u201dmend it, don\u2019t end it,\u201d as member station KPCC reported. The measure passed with 51 percent of the vote.",
        "A few months ago, neurosurgeon Jocelyne Bloch emerged from a surgery that she hadn\u2019t done before. \u201dMost of my patients are humans,\u201d says Bloch, who works at the Lausanne University Hospital in Switzerland. This patient was a rhesus macaque. The monkey\u2019s spinal cord had been partially cut. So while his brain was fine and his legs were fine, the two couldn\u2019t communicate. \u201dNormally, the brain is giving commands, and the legs are responding to the commands through the spinal cord. When you have a spinal cord lesion, then this command is interrupted,\u201d says Bloch.",
        "Like many other elections in recent memory, Tuesday\u2019s election was rife with ups and downs. Despite some major wins throughout the evening, Hillary Clinton wasn\u2019t able to win enough Electoral College votes to close the lead Donald Trump maintained. After a tight race that trudged on into the early hours of Wednesday morning, Trump was elected the 45th president of the United States. The rise of a candidate with no experience in the military or elected office baffled many in politics.",
        "Voters in the District of Columbia passed a measure on Tuesday in favor of petitioning Congress to become a state in the union. 79 percent of voters cast votes in favor of the ballot measure, which splits the district into a residential state with a small federal district in the middle of it for government buildings and monuments, as we have reported. The newly approved measure had four parts: Now that it has passed, the petition will go to Congress, which has the power to permit or deny it. D. C.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, like the business career that preceded it, was unpredictable, undisciplined and unreliable. Despite those qualities \u2014 or perhaps, in part, because of them \u2014 it was also successful. So what should we expect from Trump, mindful that his path to the White House has defied expectations at every turn? Some of Trump\u2019s ambitions have been clearly telegraphed: He plans to build a wall along the U. S. border with Mexico, deport millions of criminal immigrants, unwind trade deals dating back more than two decades and repeal Obamacare.",
        "Proposition 60, California\u2019s controversial ballot measure that would require adult film performers to use condoms, has been rejected by a margin of nearly 54 percent against and 46 percent in favor, with 99 percent of precincts reporting. The measure has been a topic of heated debate, pitting the Free Speech Coalition, the adult entertainment industry\u2019s trade association, against the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. Here\u2019s a sampling of the two sides\u2019 stances on the measure, from a recent story on NPR\u2019s Shots health blog: \u201dIts success depends on stigma around sex, stigma around porn,\u201d says the Free Speech Coalition\u2019s Mike Stabile.",
        "In late October, Donald Trump released an action plan for what he hopes to accomplish in his first 100 days in office. Below, NPR reporters and editors from the politics team and other coverage areas have annotated Trump\u2019s plan. We\u2019ve added context on several of his proposals, including whether he can really repeal Obamacare and what a hiring freeze on the federal workforce would actually look like.

        "The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up more than 1 percent Thursday at an high of 18, 807. 88, as investors bet that the Donald Trump presidency will mean less regulation and more potential stimulus spending. Specific policies remain to be seen, but the pledged during the campaign to dismantle regulations, especially the financial law, which is now boosting financial stocks. Pharmaceutical stocks posted more gains Thursday, on the anticipation that the Trump administration is much less likely to scrutinize the drug industry than his rival Hillary Clinton.",
        "During his presidential campaign, Republican Donald Trump said he would \u201dget rid of\u201d \u2014 the sweeping legislation passed in 2010 to address problems underlying the financial crisis. Many Republicans hate the law, saying it is layered with far too many regulations. But Democrats say it provides valuable oversight of an industry that they believe took too many risks on Wall Street and too much advantage of customers on Main Street. Now Trump\u2019s transition team is promising to \u201ddismantle\u201d the complex Dodd \u2014 Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act."
