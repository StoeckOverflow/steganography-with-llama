But Sissi isn\u2019t the only leader vying to be Trump\u2019s best foreign friend. In the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe, leaders known for tough policies that have brought frequent criticism from human rights groups have been quick to hail the results of the U.

But what will the details of Trump\u2019s economic policy agenda actually look like?
