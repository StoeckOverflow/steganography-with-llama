        "Popular music like every creative art is the most difficult form for the composer. surely the best is still not the worst but I am glad for every composer of popular songs. the best compositions and lyrists are the ones who have written songs and have made a mark on our hearts for years\nthe worst music and songs will fade away but the most successful will stay and stay for long periods in your life I believe\nPopular is good because it has made people aware, and made some great artists known worldly, but not to the extend that some other popular stuff",

        "Donald Trump has promised that he\u2019ll ask Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act on Day 1 of his administration. So if you\u2019re shopping for coverage on the health insurance marketplace now, should you even bother signing up? If everything\u2019s going to change shortly after coverage starts in January anyway, what\u2019s the point? While it\u2019s impossible to know exactly what changes are coming to the individual market and how soon they\u2019ll arrive, one thing is virtually certain: Nothing will happen immediately. Here are answers to questions you may have.",
        "Donald Trump has vowed that he will repeal and replace Obamacare. Specifics are scarce, but one plan Trump has outlined would change how the federal government funds Medicaid, health coverage for people. Americans now have health coverage because of Obamacare. A full quarter of them are in California. And most of them are covered by California\u2019s version of Medicaid. \u201dWinding back the clock would create all kinds of turbulence and disruption,\u201d says Larry Levitt, senior vice president for special initiatives at the Kaiser Family Foundation.",
        "Mark Zuckerberg says the notion that fake news influenced the U. S. presidential election is \u201da pretty crazy idea.\u201d The Facebook CEO is finding himself in a unique position in this election cycle. Many news organizations have come under fire for their coverage of the campaign. Now Facebook is getting it too, as a modern media company that does not vet fake news from its News Feed and that, critics argue, allows users to stay in information bubbles that reinforce existing prejudices. Zuckerberg took both these criticisms yesterday, at a conference called Techonomy.",
        "A Portland, Ore. demonstration against Donald Trump included a group of people who engaged in \u201dcriminal and dangerous behavior,\u201d authorities say, leading police to declare the Thursday night gathering a riot. Some protesters smashed windows, lit a dumpster on fire, threw objects at police and lit firecrackers, according to The Associated Press. Police say they responded with munitions fired into the crowd, and that 26 people were arrested.",
        "Women across the country are rushing to get IUDs. Or at least, they\u2019re tweeting about rushing to get birth control, according to a surge of messages on social media. They\u2019re concerned that the Trump administration might end Obamacare provisions that require insurers to cover intrauterine devices and other contraception and cut funding for abortion and reproductive health overall. So women are looking for solutions like IUDs: ones that will outlast a presidency. But they may have a bit more time than they think. They\u2019re not just talking about it on social media they\u2019re looking for more information, too.",
        "The dust is starting to settle in Washington and around the country after an election that stunned political watchers and pollsters. Here are seven things we\u2019ve learned about Donald Trump\u2019s path to victory Tuesday night: As vote continues to be counted, Hillary Clinton has now surpassed Al Gore\u2019s 2000 popular vote margin. Clinton\u2019s lead is 668, 171 over Donald Trump, according to the latest totals compiled by the U. S. Election Atlas. Gore got 547, 398 more votes than George W. Bush in 2000.

        "Donald Trump, a neophyte in foreign policy and national security issues, will take office in January facing a world of challenges. The \u2019s campaign trail pronouncements on international affairs were sometimes contradictory, often vague and seldom substantive, leaving many in the U. S. and abroad to speculate about what exactly his foreign and defense policies might look like. NPR journalists in Washington and around the world weigh in on some of the thorniest and most pressing international issues a Trump administration will confront.",
        "The Vietnam War ended more than 40 years ago, but it continues to claim military lives. Nearly every spring new names are etched into the black granite walls of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D. C. which pays tribute to the more than 58, 000 service members who lost their lives. Jim McGough is one of them. As a infantry soldier in 1971, Army Specialist McGough was with members of his unit near the Laotian border when came under fire. A grenade exploded nearby, tearing apart his feet and lower legs.",
        "Every day, visitors to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D. C. leave objects in commemoration of the thousands of names inscribed on its wall. Medals, dog tags, even pajamas and countless other items \u2014 there have been hundreds of thousands of them left at the memorial since its dedication in 1982, and still today you\u2019ll often find them laid out at the base of the memorial\u2019s long, reflective surface. Duery Felton did, too. A Vietnam veteran himself, Felton visited the wall at first with mixed feelings.",
        "Friday night brought more protests against Donald Trump\u2019s White House win, with marchers taking to the streets in cities from Miami and Atlanta to San Francisco. In Portland, Ore. police say a man was shot on a bridge by a suspect who then fled. Most of Friday\u2019s demonstrations in cities that included Iowa City and Nashville were peaceful, despite disruptions to traffic.

        "Can you find beauty in a life of hardship? If the photos from the Siena International Photo Awards are any indication, the answer is yes. Last month, the winners and in 11 categories, including travel, nature, people and portraits, were announced. Many of those top images were taken in the developing world, depicting lives affected by poverty and adversity \u2014 but not in the way you might expect. A Vietnamese woman making a fishing net looks as if she\u2019s swimming in a sea of green fire.",
        "As America continues to absorb the results of a truly contentious and historic presidential election, one group of voters may be particularly upset: Bernie Sanders supporters. For months over the course of the campaign, many in Sanders\u2019 ranks said he was the only candidate with a sure shot at beating Trump, that he could reach working class voters better than Hillary Clinton could, and that he offered a true progressive agenda that Clinton could not. But these supporters never got the chance to be proven right \u2014 or wrong. So now, some of them vent.",
        "Even a well known story depends on where you begin to tell it. In the summer of 1955, Emmett Till, a boy visiting Mississippi, was lynched by white men who said he\u2019d flirted with a white woman. Till\u2019s body was returned home to Chicago where his mother insisted on an open casket. Photos were wired around the globe and the world saw his mutilated body. His murderers would be free within a month. Writer John Edgar Wideman was thinking of writing a novel based on the Till case, when he came across the story of Louis Till, Emmett\u2019s father.",
        "The Karamlesh village meeting begins the traditional way, with Christian prayers led by a priest, murmured and sung, lingering in the evening air. But the meeting\u2019s not in the actual village of Karamlesh. It\u2019s 40 miles away in the northern Iraqi city of Erbil, on red plastic chairs under a sky, next to the corrugated trailers some of these people have been living in since 2014 when the Islamic State took their village. Karamlesh is one of a cluster of Christian villages nestled in the Nineveh plain, in northern Iraq near Mosul.",
        "Since 1996, sportscaster Joe Buck has been announcing Super Bowls, golf tournaments, bass fishing, motorcycle jumps and, of course, baseball.

        "I\u2019ve written about Gustav Mahler and his monumental symphonic achievements before, but right now I\u2019m not sure there has ever been a more fitting symphony for our time than Mahler\u2019s Symphony No. 6. Today, as we have become immune to shock, where nothing seems too extreme and where hyperbole rules, Mahler and his Sixth Symphony seem to fit right in. Mahler was a man of excess, spectacle, illusion and indulgence. Most likely a narcissist, he was also devastatingly brilliant, a shameless self promoter and a man of enormous contradictions who fed off conflict and constructed delusions of grandeur.",
        "As you probably have guessed, there has been a lot of conversation about race this week \u2014 So. Much.

        "Many police officers are warmly welcoming the election of Donald Trump, believing he\u2019ll defend against what many officers see as growing sentiment. Trump was endorsed by the National Fraternal Order of Police, the largest organization of cops, and Executive Director Jim Pasco says that support was enthusiastic. \u201dI\u2019ve seen a level of resolve and commitment on the part of our membership unlike any in some long time,\u201d Pasco says.",
        "A year ago today, terrorists attacked six locations in Paris, killing 130 people. Most of them were shot during a rock concert at a venue called the Bataclan. The attacks led to heightened security throughout Europe, and they\u2019ve also led to some changes in how rock bands tour. Will Hackney is packing gear into a van on a loading dock in Portland, Ore. He\u2019s the bass player and tour manager for the band Flock of Dimes.",
        "This has been a big week for words. We\u2019ve heard a lot of words. We\u2019ve said a lot of words. We\u2019ve typed and tweeted and texted a lot of words. We\u2019ve struggled to find the right words. We\u2019ve hung our hopes on words. If by now you\u2019re feeling worded out, here\u2019s some warm respite for your weekend: some of our favorite pieces of music without words.

        "In the language of the Crimean Tatars, the word musafir means \u201dguest.\u201d It\u2019s also the name of one of Crimea\u2019s most popular restaurants. But that name took on added significance when the Tatar outpost relocated to the Ukrainian capital of Kiev in May of last year. According to Sorina Seitvelieva, who owns the restaurant with her Emine Emirsalieva, Musafir was forced to cease operations in the Crimean city of Bakhchyserai after Russia orchestrated an armed takeover of Crimea in March of 2014.

        "Donald Trump has proposed a very detailed tax plan \u2014 but his statements on the campaign trail don\u2019t always match what his proposal would really do. For instance, at a rally in Scranton, Pa. Trump promised to \u201dmassively cut taxes for the middle class, the forgotten people, the forgotten men and women of this country, who built our country.\u201d During a town hall meeting on NBC\u2019s Today show, he said he believes in raising taxes on the wealthy.

Known as \u201dminibrains,\u201d these rudimentary networks of cells are small enough to fit on the head of a pin, but already are providing researchers with insights into everything from early brain development to Down syndrome, Alzheimer\u2019s and Zika.

        "After nearly two years of running for president, on Thursday, Hillary Clinton went for a hike near her home in Chappaqua, N. Y. It was a quiet moment after a devastating loss that likely marked the end of her political career. Over four decades of public life, Clinton has always been a disruptive presence, who went places and did things that haven\u2019t been done before \u2014 at least not by women. When Bill Clinton ran for president in 1992, he advertised it as a deal."
