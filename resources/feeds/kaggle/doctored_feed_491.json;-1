        "Explaining the return of A Tribe Called Quest to the pop firmament is nigh impossible without hyperbole, so here goes: Imagine The Beatles had reunited to give us all one last classic, something as substantive as Abbey Road \u2014 instead of \u201dFree as a Bird,\u201d the quaint single the Fab Four released 25 years after breaking up. Tribe wasn\u2019t the first act to try sensitivity (after all, LL Cool J\u2019s \u201dI Need Love\u201d predates the group\u2019s 1990 debut, People\u2019s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm).",

Alex Ebsary, a member of the Music in Exile team, explains that its mandate is straightforward: \u201dWhat we do is go around, either to refugee camps or to places that we know there will be refugees or internally displaced Iraqis, and try to find musicians,\u201d he says.",

It\u2019s the nearest supermoon in almost 70 years \u2014 and we won\u2019t see another like it until 2034. \u201dWhen a full moon makes its closest pass to Earth in its orbit it appears up to 14 percent bigger and 30 percent brighter, making it a supermoon,\u201d NASA says.

        "It\u2019s been an emotional week for Americans in the wake of election results. Many have been talking about what it all means and how this country can find common ground and reunite. One particular person who has been pondering on this is British rock star, Sting, who has made the U. S. his home for several years now. The winning musician has sold millions of records and this week, he released a new album called, 57th 9th. It\u2019s his first collection of original songs in more than a decade.",

Y. she stood in her church\u2019s Bronx community hall and tried to convince the assembled Indian immigrants that they should consider holding services in English. Until that point, services at the St. Thomas Church had been held in Malayalam, the native language of Kerala, a state in south India. It\u2019s the language this community has been praying and preaching in for centuries. The aunties and uncles seated in the hall were unconvinced.",

Way, way back. \u201dIt\u2019s been around for at least 5, 000 years and probably longer,\u201d says Stewart Cole, who directs the Global Health Institute at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. The disease, which causes nerve damage and skin ulcers, likely originated in Africa \u2014 tens of thousands of years ago. Migrated to Asia and Europe as people did.

And Richard Painter, who served as ethics adviser under President George W.

        "Advisers to Donald Trump are considering whether to retain FBI Director James Comey after the agency became an issue in one of the most divisive campaigns in modern history, three sources told NPR. Comey has nearly seven years left to serve in his term.

President Obama has sworn to close it Trump wants to fill it up again. Obama has been promising the closure will happen since his second day in office in 2009. In February, he repeated that pledge one more time, saying, \u201dI\u2019m absolutely committed to closing the detention facility at Guantanamo.\u201d That same day, at a campaign rally in Sparks, Nevada, Donald Trump was promising the opposite.",

Stuart Cohen, reporting for NPR from Sydney, said military aircraft will be taking in tons of supplies and ferrying out hundreds of stranded tourists.",
        "Donald Trump took direct shots at some of the biggest tech companies during the presidential campaign. When Apple wouldn\u2019t help the FBI unlock a phone used by a terrorist, he suggested boycotting the company. In a Fox News interview, he lashed out against Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. \u201dThe politicians in Washington don\u2019t tax Amazon like they should be taxed,\u201d Trump said. \u201dHe\u2019s got a huge antitrust problem because he\u2019s controlling so much.\u201d For his part, Bezos once tweeted he\u2019d like to reserve Trump a seat on his commercial space rocket.",
        "Last fall, I was an American college student in Paris, studying international security and terrorism. I knew when I chose Paris that it would be an excellent place to further my studies, but I did not expect to experience the subject . Everyone I met in Paris felt safe there, whether they were other Americans or French. I had one friend who felt safer in Paris than she felt in Austin, Texas, where we attended the University of Texas. We all thought our discussions about terrorism were mostly theoretical and about events taking place somewhere else.",
        "Millennials might have been Hillary Clinton\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel on Tuesday night. Obama won 60 percent of the millennial vote. Clinton got only about 55 percent. (We\u2019re using \u201dmillennials\u201d as shorthand for voters between the ages of 18 and 29, but some millennials are in their 30s). But it\u2019s not that young voters across the country were necessarily flocking to the Republican Party this year. The real shift seems to have come from an increase in candidate support, potentially low turnout, and stronger than expected support for Donald Trump in some Midwestern states that Clinton lost.",
        "Even before any election happens, it\u2019s pretty easy to predict where the demographic fault lines will be: whites tend to vote more Republican than . Women tend to vote more Democratic than men. This year, it became clear that there was a growing gap between white voters with college degrees, who tend to vote more Democratic, and those without degrees, who vote more Republican. Here\u2019s another divide that started to get more attention this election: the gap.",
        "Grapefruit\u2019s bitterness can make it hard to love. Indeed, people often smother it in sugar just to get it down. And yet Americans were once urged to sweeten it with salt. Ad campaigns from the first and second world wars tried to convince us that \u201dGrapefruit Tastes Sweeter With Salt!\u201d as one 1946 ad for Morton\u2019s in Life magazine put it. The pairing, these ads swore, enhanced the flavor. In our world, these curious culinary time capsules raise the question: Does salt really make grapefruit taste sweeter?",

Franklin, who was largely may have been a genius, but he wasn\u2019t really an outlier when it comes to American making and tinkering.

But a study finds that you can reduce that risk greatly with a healthful lifestyle. Scientists have been wondering whether that\u2019s the case. To find out, one international consortium looked at data from four large studies that had isolated genetic risk factors for heart disease. They identified genetic markers that seem to put people at nearly twice the risk for heart disease.",
        "What is Donald Trump\u2019s national security plan? Some things are clear: Trump supports billions of dollars in new Pentagon spending for military hardware. He\u2019d permit more veterans to seek care outside the federal system of the Department of Veterans Affairs. He\u2019d keep open the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Much else, however, is not. During Trump\u2019s campaign against Hillary Clinton, the candidates rarely talked about terrorism, Iraq, Syria or other issues, aside from using it as a way to condemn one another.",

        "The State Department has opened up a transition office, but that corner office in Washington\u2019s Foggy Bottom neighborhood is quiet for now as diplomats await news of their new boss. Donald Trump\u2019s pick for secretary of state could tell a lot about the direction he will take U. S. foreign policy. At the moment, all eyes are on former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a longtime friend of Trump and strong backer throughout the campaign. He\u2019s an unlikely candidate with little foreign policy experience, though he did manage the city that is home to the United Nations."
