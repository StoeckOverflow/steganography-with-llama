        "With the defeat of Hillary by President elect Donald, it seems like we need our very favorite, favorite people more now ever in history and the best place in our hearts, but the world of theater. literally just had its heart broken with two announements of departures of long standing stars. We\u2019s love, adore these talants but sad we\u2019\u2019d have more to share from their talents on our site! Here\u2019 we go\u2026\nThe first was that Kristian Bush (the other) from country pop rock hit",
        "House Speaker Paul Ryan has been unanimously by his party to continue to serve as speaker in the 115th Congress. According to Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong, Ryan was nominated by Rep. Mick Mulvaney, . C. a founding member of the conservative Freedom Caucus that helped to push out former House Speaker John Boehner. Reps. Chris Collins, . Y. who was the first House Republican to endorse Donald during the primaries, and Martha McSally, . seconded the nomination. Ryan still has to win a majority by the full House when the new Congress convenes on January 3, 2017.",
        "Election night was complicated for Azra Baig. She\u2019s a school board member in suburban South Brunswick, N. J. Baig was running for reelection this fall. She had just put out yard signs with her name on them when a friend from her mosque called. \u201dSomeone wrote \u2019ISIS sympathizer\u2019 on the sign,\u201d Baig says. That caught Baig by surprise. She\u2019s the only Muslim on the school board. But there\u2019s a sizable Muslim population in South Brunswick and the surrounding towns. And this didn\u2019t just happen once or twice. \u201dThe next day, we found another sign that was vandalized,\u201d Baig says.",
        "I was in a Brooklyn coffee shop when a woman, an apparent regular, leaned over to the barista and relayed an unnerving scene she witnessed on the subway: A Muslim man asked another passenger what stop to take for the ferry to the Statue of Liberty. The passenger, a white man, responded, \u201dWhy, so you can go bomb it?\u201d The Muslim man explained that he was on vacation and that he\u2019d always dreamed of taking his family to see the landmark.",
        "Airstrikes pounded the embattled eastern side of Aleppo, which is controlled by rebels, after several weeks of relative calm in the northern Syrian city. The Syrians and their Russian allies have heavily bombed the eastern part of Aleppo, though it was not immediately clear who carried out the renewed attacks. Russia declared a humanitarian pause to the bombings about a month ago. The operation began just hours after U. S. Donald Trump and Russian President Vladmir Putin had a phone conversation Tuesday, The Associated Press writes.",
        "A massive stone building with a big eagle insignia on the front belongs to the U. S. Consulate General in Jerusalem. Israelis and Palestinians come here to apply for visas. It looks like an embassy. But it isn\u2019t. No U. S. administration has ever officially recognized Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. Yet on the campaign trail, Donald Trump promised to do so, and to move the U. S. Embassy to Jerusalem from its current location in Tel Aviv. Eliezer Shapiro, at the consulate to renew his passport, says it\u2019s time.",
        "Twitter\u2019s inability to curb harassment and trolling has long plagued the social platform \u2014 by far its biggest criticism. The company is now trying something it hopes will rein in abusive users. Twitter says it\u2019s adding new ways for users to flag or avoid seeing offensive posts in the broadest attempt yet to tackle the problem. Users can already \u201dmute\u201d \u2014 as in, hide from view \u2014 accounts they find offensive.",
        "What could the world of medical research look like under a Trump administration? It\u2019s hardly an idle question. The federal government spends more than $30 billion a year to fund the National Institutes of Health. That\u2019s the single largest chunk of federal research funding spent outside the Pentagon\u2019s sphere of influence. Policy insiders confronted that question \u2014 albeit with an acute shortage of actual data \u2014 Monday at a meeting of health advocates in New York City. The biotech and pharmaceutical companies, which are at the end of the pipeline, see encouraging signs for their enterprises.",
        "The angular steel and concrete skeleton of Egypt\u2019s huge new museum rises up on the Giza plains, in sight of the pyramids that inspired it. When it opens next year, visitors to the Grand Egyptian Museum will be able to see the Great Pyramid of Khufu and the Pyramid of Menkaure through the glass wall that fronts the galleries. The back wall will be made partly of alabaster, meant to glow like a jewel in the setting sun. Like the pyramids on the horizon, there is nothing modest about this museum.",
        "The Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that people have health insurance or pay a fine is one of the least popular provisions of the law, and one that Republicans have pledged to eliminate when they repeal and replace Obamacare. But take a look at some of the replacement proposals that are floating around and it becomes clear that the \u201dindividual mandate,\u201d as it\u2019s called, could still exist, but in another guise. First, though, the health law\u2019s mandate doesn\u2019t actually require people to have insurance. Instead, it imposes a tax penalty on most people if they don\u2019t have coverage.",
        "Florida conservation officials say a female panther has crossed a river, and it could be a big deal for the survival of the species. Florida panthers are endangered \u2014 about 200 of the large cats live in south Florida, in an area that\u2019s less than 5 percent of their original range. If the animal is to thrive, it needs to do two things: expand its territory and breed. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has a recovery plan for the panther (as well as a Living with Panthers guide for residents) based on those objectives.",
        "Activists engaged in a national \u201dday of action\u201d Tuesday to protest the controversial Dakota Access oil pipeline. Native American groups\u2019 opposition to the project has gotten a lot of attention recently, but it\u2019s just one of many pipeline battles going on across the country. And Donald Trump\u2019s election and his stance in favor of fossil fuels are likely to mean those battles will continue. Pipelines have taken center stage in an intense fight over the nation\u2019s energy future, concerns about global climate change and private property rights.",
        "In Chernobyl, the site of the world\u2019s worst nuclear disaster, a giant protective shield is slowly being moved into place a couple of feet at a time. The concrete and steel arch is billed as the \u201dlargest movable structure ever built,\u201d and it is seen as an important step toward ultimately securing and dismantling the still dangerous reactor. The shield, which was built over several years in the shadow of the Chernobyl reactor, is designed to secure the site for at least 100 years.",
        "If you followed the presidential polls at all closely, chances are that you expected Hillary Clinton to win last week. So did all of the major prediction models that use polls to game out election outcome probabilities. So perhaps everyone should have expected that in a year when all political norms were broken, the polls that the political world fixates upon would also prove to be flawed. Pollsters will be digging for months (at least) to figure out how exactly their results may have been off.",
        "Since Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has come out not once, but twice, to address the issue of fake news, inaccurate or simply false information that appears on the Web in the guise of journalism. Zuckerberg made his remarks at the Techonomy 16 media conference and then on his own Facebook page.",
        "This year, the National Book Awards ceremony comes at a time when the nation has rarely seemed more divided. The bitter presidential campaign exposed a fault line in the United States that will not easily be repaired. And while there\u2019s no one simple answer, Lisa Lucas, head of the National Book Foundation, recommends one way to understand the other side: read. \u201dMy life is small\u201d she says, \u201dand I think books are a way to make your life larger.\u201d Lucas has an almost unbounded belief in the power of reading.",
        "The National Book Foundation announced Wednesday that it will soon have a new leader at the helm. Lisa Lucas, the publisher of Guernica magazine, is set to become only the third executive director in the history of the foundation, which oversees the annual National Book Awards. \u201dIt has just been an ecstatic joy to be able to do work in service of readers,\u201d Lucas tells NPR.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s election has sent tremors through America\u2019s refugee advocate community, and caused fear and uncertainty among the most recently resettled refugees, the Syrians. They listened with alarm as candidate Trump called them \u201dterrorists\u201d and blamed them, incorrectly, for violent attacks in America. \u201dThat rhetoric has had an impact,\u201d says Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, a legal aid program.",
        "Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel added his voice to the chorus of mayors who say theirs will remain \u201dsanctuary cities\u201d in response to Donald Trump\u2019s positions on illegal immigration. Surrounded by immigration activists, business leaders and state and federal lawmakers, Emanuel sought to reduce the fear of immigrants living in this country without authorization. \u201dTo all those who are, after Tuesday\u2019s election, very nervous and filled with anxiety . ..",
        "One of the promises Donald Trump made on the campaign trail was to dismantle or renegotiate the U. S. deal with Iran that limits its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. If he makes good on that promise, it won\u2019t be the first time a Republican administration has walked away from an arms deal negotiated by Democrats. In 1994 the Clinton administration struck a deal with North Korea that essentially would freeze Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for aid. The Agreed Framework was highly controversial in Congress.",
        "Mantis shrimp, a group of aggressive, crustaceans, take more than one ribbon in the animal kingdom. Outwardly, they resemble their somewhat larger lobster cousins, but their colorful shells contain an impressive set of superpowers. Now, scientists are finding that one of those abilities \u2014 incredible eyesight \u2014 has implications for people with cancer that are potentially lifesaving. \u201dThey have these ridiculous eyes that sense so many things at once,\u201d says Sam Powell, a doctoral student in computer science and engineering at Washington University in St. Louis.",
        "Pioneering journalist Gwen Ifill, host of Washington Week and PBS NewsHour, has died. She spoke about herself and her career many times over the years.",
        "I wasn\u2019t alone in patiently waiting for new music from John Paul White. His singing and songwriting as half of The Civil Wars was heartfelt and beautiful. This summer, a new album finally came, and Beulah was a quietly understated gem. This is tender Southern music without drawl or pretense, and I love it.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s first week after pulling off an upset victory has had plenty of missteps. The rocky start to his transition planning that one source described to CNN as a \u201dknife fight\u201d has done little to assure his critics and skeptical Republicans that he\u2019ll have a smooth ascension to the Oval Office surrounded by qualified advisers. Trump denies that the transition is rocky. From the outset, his transition chief throughout the campaign, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, had to be replaced with Vice Mike Pence.",
        "Steve Bannon, recently named as chief strategist to Donald Trump, is a fantastic manager, a visionary journalist and \u201dhas no prejudices,\u201d according to a top editor who has worked with him for years. In an interview with Morning Edition\u2019s Steve Inskeep, Breitbart Senior Editor at Large Joel Pollak defended Bannon and pushed back against the idea that the news website he ran and significantly expanded promoted racist or sexist views. On the contrary, Pollak accused NPR\u2019s Code Switch blog, which covers race and culture, of being \u201dracist\u201d itself.",
        "The Trump transition team is a work in progress, but there are certain things we know. It\u2019s being led by Vice Mike Pence, and it includes an executive committee that includes several members of Donald Trump\u2019s family. NPR has obtained an organizational chart, which lists the names of those who are heading \u201dteams\u201d with responsibility for many of the federal agencies and departments. Several of them, especially in the national security realm, played advisory roles in the Trump campaign. Most are white men.",
        "Donald Trump has made it clear that Vice Mike Pence will have a major role in governing. He recently tapped Pence to take over leadership of his transition planning from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and Pence spent the day Tuesday at Trump Tower as the two men select key members of their administration. It\u2019s hard to imagine two men with more different personalities and backgrounds. Trump \u2014 with his brand name and background in real estate \u2014 was an unconventional candidate from the beginning.",
        "The U. S. Geological Survey says a deposit in West Texas is the largest continuous oil and gas deposit ever discovered in the United States. On Tuesday, the USGS announced that an area known as the Wolfcamp shale contains 20 billion barrels of oil and 16 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. That is nearly three times more petroleum than the agency found in North Dakota\u2019s Bakken shale in 2013.",
        "President Obama has announced the last group of people to whom he will award the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor. The group of 21 luminaries includes athletes Michael Jordan and Kareem musicians Diana Ross and Bruce Springsteen and actors Robert De Niro, Tom Hanks, Robert Redford and Cicely Tyson. The group also honors inspiring people who may not be household names, such as Native American community leader and advocate Elouise Cobell and computer code pioneer Grace Hopper, both of whom are deceased.",
        "Jewish women sing songs of worship as they march arm in arm with male supporters through an area of Jerusalem\u2019s Old City. They\u2019re from a group called Women of the Wall, which lobbies for women to be allowed to pray, sing and read the Bible aloud at the Western Wall, the most important site for Jewish prayer. They hold these marches about once a month, and they often get heckled. Today is no different. men sneer and beseech the women to go silent."
