And there\u2019s no proof that those products are going to keep you from getting sick. When you\u2019re exposed to a virus like the influenza virus, a number of factors determine whether you actually get sick, and if so, how severely.",
        "Donald Trump will take office at a pivotal time for the world\u2019s neediest. The world\u2019s wealthy countries have, since 2000, been part of a historic partnership with poor countries to eliminate poverty and roll back diseases. Over the past 16 years millions were given access to lifesaving and malaria treatments.

The work did sometimes get tedious, he says, but he didn\u2019t really mind. \u201dJust as long as I got the job done, it was fine,\u201d he says.",

At an event Monday, in the desert north of Phoenix, more than 1, 000 gun owners and enthusiasts gathered for a 1000 Man Shoot.",
        "It\u2019s no secret that Donald Trump campaigned as a champion of gun rights, but a Trump administration poses both welcome relief and an immediate problem for the gun industry. For Larry Cavener, who recently visited a new gun shop called Tactical Advantage in Overland Park, Kan. this election means he can breathe easier. \u201dThis means that we\u2019re not gonna be under siege for a few years, and it seems like it has been,\u201d Cavener says. But the Obama years have actually been awesome for the U. S. gun industry.",
        "Superheroes are democratic ideals. They exist to express what\u2019s noblest about us: selflessness, sacrifice, a commitment to protect those who need protection, and to empower the powerless. Superheroes are fascist ideals. They exist to symbolize the notion that might equals right, that a select few should dictate the fate of the world, and that the status quo is to be protected at all costs. Both of these things are true, and inextricably bound up with one another \u2014 but they weren\u2019t always. When he debuted in 1938, Superman was, briefly, a progressive icon.",
        "When Donald Trump enters the Oval Office, his presidency will begin with a national security challenge that has no precedent \u2014 four separate wars where the U. S. military is bombing Islamist extremists. Presidential transitions in wartime aren\u2019t new, and some earlier conflicts were on a much larger scale. President Obama confronted two major wars on his first day in 2009. President Nixon came into office as the Vietnam War raged. President Truman assumed office when Franklin D. Roosevelt died in the final months of World War II.",
        "When the Obama administration announced last year that it would overhaul the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, prospective college students (and their parents) cheered. \u201dToday, we\u2019re lending a hand to millions of high school students who want to go to college and who\u2019ve worked hard,\u201d said Arne Duncan, who was at that time U.

S. by aiming some of his sharpest stabs at that old and vicious shaming device: the food slur. Aware that racism, like an army, marches on its stomach, Beatty, a who writes in the satirical tradition of Kurt Vonnegut, Richard Pryor and weaponizes watermelons, fried chicken, chitterlings and other foods used to slander and shame blacks, even as he cracks lethal jokes about poverty and respectability politics.",
        "Poverty was one of the forgotten issues on the campaign trail this election season. Now, many who work with the nation\u2019s poor worry that it will be even more forgotten under a Trump administration and the new Republican Congress.

As he watched the boats go by, his friend, a young bohemian dancer named Suzanne Verdal, whose warehouse it was, served him tea and oranges that came all the way from China. Or so he famously sang in his 1967 debut single, \u201dSuzanne.\u201d The haunting ballad would launch Cohen\u2019s musical career, taking him from a minor poet and novelist to one of the great songwriters of our time.",

Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 one of the most insightful, adept leaders in the business world \u2014 has a problem. It\u2019s a problem he has been slow to acknowledge, even though it\u2019s become more apparent by the day. Several current and former Facebook employees tell NPR there is a lot of internal turmoil about how the platform does and doesn\u2019t censor content that users find offensive.

On Thursday night, Crapser arrived in South Korea \u2014 his native country, and a completely foreign land \u2014 according to the Associated Press.

        "In 1964, the U. S. surgeon general released a report on the health impacts of smoking, and it shaped the public and government\u2019s attitudes toward tobacco for years to come. On Thursday, another surgeon general\u2019s report was issued, this time tackling a much broader issue: addiction and the misuse and abuse of chemical substances. The focus isn\u2019t just one drug, but all of them. Though little in the report is new, it puts impressive numbers to the problem, and some surprising context: More people use prescription opioids than use tobacco.",

        "The golden poison dart frog is about an inch long and banana yellow. By some estimates, the skin of one little frog contains enough toxin to kill 10 adult men. \u201dOh yeah, it\u2019s one of the more lethal poisons on the planet,\u201d says Justin Du Bois, a synthetic chemist at Stanford University. The substance is called batrachotoxin ( ) and tiny amounts of it can be deadly if it makes it into a victim\u2019s bloodstream. It\u2019s what some indigenous groups in Colombia\u2019s lowland rain forest would use to tip their blow darts.",
        "Every four years, the Electoral College creeps back into the lives of American voters. In some presidential elections, the strange, indirect system used to select the next U. S. president can feel like a formality that doesn\u2019t seem to matter much. In other elections, it matters very much indeed. This is one of those years. On Nov. 8, Donald Trump surpassed the necessary electoral votes to become the nation\u2019s . But if you look at the popular vote, which is the direct number of votes cast, Hillary Clinton beat Trump by about 1 million votes.",

        "The number of doctors who each prescribe millions of dollars of medications annually in Medicare\u2019s drug program has soared, driven by expensive hepatitis C treatments and rising drug prices overall, federal data obtained by ProPublica show.

At a Children\u2019s Defense Fund event in Washington, she spoke about the importance of fighting for America\u2019s kids, but she also wove in another message, telling her supporters to persist, even after the devastating loss of the presidential race. \u201dI know many of you are deeply disappointed about the results of the election,\u201d she said. \u201dI am, too, more than I can ever express.\u201d Though her speech centered on fighting child poverty, she was straightforward in addressing her bruising defeat.",

Comic books are known for their heroes, too. But in March, U. S. Rep.",
