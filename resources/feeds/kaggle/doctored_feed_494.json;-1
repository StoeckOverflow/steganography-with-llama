In this regard we rejoinder in our report that we are witness, in some cases, that the Holy Bible has become a household book.\nIn Eastern and Central Russia the Church is expandable as it expelled its former Soviet oppress.",

No duo has more profoundly recast those expectations over the last two decades than Gillian Welch and Dave Rawlings, who\u2019ve mainly performed under her name.",
        "A $25 million settlement agreement has been reached in the civil fraud lawsuits against Donald Trump and Trump University, according to New York\u2019s state attorney general.

The plan was announced by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, part of the Department of the Interior, and includes 11 approved lease areas to be sold between 2017 and 2022. In all, it makes available about 70 percent of the offshore oil and gas resources that are \u201deconomically recoverable\u201d if oil remains around $40 per barrel.

        "Jeff Sessions of Alabama was the first Republican senator to get behind renegade candidate Trump. Now, he is Donald Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general \u2014 and his stance on immigration and allegations of racism are sure to draw scrutiny in confirmation hearings. Long before Trump was winning primaries, or picking up political endorsements, he had a conservative ally in the Deep South. \u201dWe have a man here who really helped me,\u201d Trump said about Sessions while campaigning last year in Alabama. \u201dHe\u2019s the one person I sought his counsel, because he\u2019s been so spot on.",
        "Despite reports of disarray on Donald Trump\u2019s transition team, it doesn\u2019t appear to have slowed the process of filling key positions. Trump has announced his picks for chief of staff, national security adviser, and his first Cabinet secretary as fast or faster than many of his recent predecessors. Trump selected RNC chairman Reince Priebus as chief of staff just five days after winning election. Of the last five presidents, only Barack Obama acted more quickly. George H. W.",
        "Updated at 11:45 a. m. ET, Donald Trump announced his selections today for three key posts: Michael Flynn for national security adviser, Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general and Rep. Mike Pompeo for CIA director. Trump\u2019s selections signal that he is prioritizing loyalty as he chooses nominees for top posts \u2014 turning to people who were early and outspoken supporters of his campaign. Sessions is a former U. S. attorney and current senator with lengthy experience with the Justice Department, but whose nomination for a federal judgeship was tanked by reports of racist comments.",
        "Michael Flynn, Donald Trump\u2019s planned choice for National Security Adviser, is perhaps best known to the American public for his fiery speech at the Republican National Convention in the summer, when he spoke to chants of \u201dlock her up,\u201d a reference to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton \u2014 and joined in himself. It was a strange position for someone who was a career military officer and a registered Democrat from Rhode Island. Within military circles, Flynn was a highly respected \u2014 though at times controversial \u2014 career intelligence officer.",
        "The World Health Organization announced Friday that it no longer considers the Zika epidemic a public health emergency of international concern. But Zika\u2019s threat to pregnant women and babies is not going away anytime soon, the agency says. Instead, the virus is now a chronic problem, says the WHO\u2019s Dr. Pete Salama. \u201dIt is really important that we communicate this very clearly: We are not downgrading the importance of Zika,\u201d Salama says. \u201dIn fact, by placing this as a longer term program of work, we\u2019re sending the message that Zika is here to stay.",

They have been fighting ISIS all over the country since 2014, when about a third of Iraq fell to the extremists. Speaking at a little base in northern Iraq, they say the fight for ISIS\u2019 largest stronghold, Mosul, is different. \u201dIn Anbar, there was just us and them,\u201d said Cpl.

        "Though also a real estate developer, Jared Kushner is many things that Donald Trump is not. At 35 years old, Kushner is half Trump\u2019s age. He is an Orthodox Jew. Trump has been accused over the course of the campaign of trafficking in themes. Kushner is understated. He shies away from the limelight. Neither of those descriptions attaches to the . Yet the two men share a trust and a bond that are real. Kushner is reported by several news organizations to be consulting lawyers to determine whether he can take an unpaid role in the new administration.",
        "The possibility that Donald Trump\u2019s Jared Kushner, could fill a senior position in the White House raises thorny legal questions \u2014 one of which is whether it would run afoul of a federal statute. Kushner was a close adviser to Trump throughout his campaign, but to officially employ Kushner in the White House would mean navigating the ambiguities surrounding the law. Congress passed the law in 1967. It\u2019s widely perceived that the lawmakers who wrote the statute were motivated in part by President Kennedy\u2019s nomination of his brother Robert as attorney general.",
        "Food works better than Valium, I\u2019m famous for telling my clients. Cookies and milk are comforting. A bowl of ice cream eases stress like nothing else. But as comforting as food can be, if it\u2019s the only thing that helps you manage your mood, you\u2019re at greater risk for more serious mental health problems, from anxiety and depression to body dissatisfaction and eating disorders. Instead of relying exclusively on food to manage mood, I encourage clients to practice meditation, yoga and other \u201d \u201d coping strategies.",
        "Human life is inherently uncertain. We are vulnerable and we know it. Throughout our long history, we humans have always looked for some means of control to master our uncertainty, especially as the possibilities of storm and darkness descend. For the last four centuries, science has played a particular \u2014 and particularly unique \u2014 role in addressing our uncertainty and our hope for control. Most importantly, in science\u2019s rise came a new kind of approach to the world that led with questions. Those inquiries were then followed closely by a method that was expected to yield shared answers.",
        "California\u2019s decision to legalize marijuana was touted as a victory for those who had argued that the state needed a system to decriminalize, regulate and tax it. But the new law, approved by voters on Nov. 8, also could be a boon to the tobacco industry at a time when cigarette smoking is down and cigarette companies are looking for ways to expand their market, according to researchers in Los Angeles County and around the state.",
        "A girl in the U. K. who was dying of cancer won the right to be cryogenically frozen, in a case that\u2019s being described as remarkable \u2014 and potentially the first of its kind. The girl wanted to have her body preserved in the hopes that scientists someday would be able to bring her back to life and cure her illness. Her wishes were initially supported by her mother but not her father, which led the girl to seek a judge\u2019s intervention to ensure that her mother would decide what would happen to her body.",
        "Every morning in a government office building in Boulder, Colo. about a dozen people type a code into a door and line up against a wall on the other side. There are a couple of guys in military uniform, and some scientists in Hawaiian shirts. They work at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and they\u2019re here for a daily space weather forecast. \u201dGood morning, everyone,\u201d says Jeff Stankiewicz, one of 11 forecasters who rotate around the clock.

        "Donald Trump took to Twitter on Thursday night to say Ford Motor Co. executive chairman William Ford Jr. had called to say the company would not move production of the Lincoln MKC from its Louisville Assembly Plant to Mexico. A second Trump tweet claimed credit for the decision. Ford, however, said it neither planned to close the Louisville, Ky. plant nor reduce jobs there. The company said it had considered moving Lincoln production to Mexico to increase production of the Ford Escape in Louisville.",
        "If there\u2019s a singular message in the latest work from The Avett Brothers, it\u2019s this: Love everyone. Their video for the song \u201dAin\u2019t No Man,\u201d released this past summer, challenges preconceived notions about race and religion by observing the way people treat each other at a busy airport. That video ends with the band sitting down for what appears to be a photo shoot or interview.",
        "Many, many Thanksgivings ago, my fiance took me home to Allentown, Pa. to be inspected by his family. During our visit, my served a relish so delicious that I married her son. Ever since, I\u2019ve shared the recipe with NPR listeners right before Thanksgiving. Now, supportive listeners may be shocked to learn that over the years, I\u2019ve gotten a good deal of grief about this recipe \u2014 especially from my NPR colleagues, many of whom have never bothered to taste it! So last year, when the head chef in NPR\u2019s cafeteria made a batch, I decided to seek redemption.",
        "For Freida Lockaby, an unemployed woman who lives with her dog in an aging mobile home in Manchester, Ky. one of America\u2019s poorest places, the Affordable Care Act was life altering. The law allowed Kentucky to expand Medicaid in 2014 and made Lockaby \u2014 along with 440, 000 other state residents \u2014 newly eligible for free health care under the insurance program. Enrollment gave Lockaby her first insurance in 11 years. \u201dIt\u2019s been a godsend to me,\u201d said the former Ohio school custodian who moved to Kentucky a decade ago.",
        "Donald Trump may be taking the old adage of keeping friends close and enemies closer to heart. The met 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney in Bedminster, N. J. on Saturday, and after the meeting the two emerged with signals it had gone well. \u201dWe had a far reaching conversation with regards to the various theaters in the world where there are interests of the United States of real significance,\u201d Romney told the press assembled outside Trump\u2019s golf course.",
        "Vice Mike Pence was presumably seeking a quiet night out at the theater, enjoying one of Broadway\u2019s hottest tickets with a Friday night performance of Hamilton: An American Musical. What he got instead was a welcome of boos and cheers from the crowd and a pointed plea from the diverse cast and crew afterwards about what they believe really makes America great.",
        "On our episode of the Code Switch podcast, Shereen Marisol Meraji and I interviewed Negin Farsad, a comedian and filmmaker, and Gustavo Arellano, the editor of the OC Weekly and the author of the satirical \u00a1Ask A Mexican! column. Our guests suggested that, in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s victory, racial animus in America \u2014 or at least, Americans\u2019 boundless capacity to countenance it \u2014 could be combated if people of color more actively engaged white people, assuaging their anxieties. Farsad and Arellano presented that idea humorously, but the ask was a serious one.",
        "Yep. Donald J. Trump. That\u2019s still a thing. So while you continue to process that, we wanted to catch you up on some of some things you ought to read, hear and watch around the world of race and culture.

The cancer went into remission, but returned this year. She told Terry Gross about the difficulty of her treatment: \u201dI couldn\u2019t sing.",
        "It\u2019s A Holiday Soul Party! isn\u2019t just the title of Sharon Jones The \u2019 new album. It also describes perfectly what you\u2019re about to see. No one does soul like this band, and having the group perform traditional and nontraditional tunes for the holiday brought joy and laughs to NPR\u2019s staff. Performed the week of Hanukkah, this set included a future holiday staple: \u201d8 Days (Of Hanukkah).\u201d When Jones sings, \u201dWe\u2019re cooking up the brisket the kosher butcher sold my uncle Saul,\u201d it sent my memories reeling.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s election win has focused attention on his business interests around the world and how they might affect his foreign policy.

        "There\u2019s new evidence that excessive screen time early in life can change the circuits in a growing brain. Scientists disagree, though, about whether those changes are helpful, or just cause problems. Both views emerged during the Society for Neuroscience meeting in San Diego this week. The debate centered on a study of young mice exposed to six hours daily of a sound and light show reminiscent of a video game. The mice showed \u201ddramatic changes everywhere in the brain,\u201d said Ramirez, director of the Center for Integrative Brain Research at Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital.",
