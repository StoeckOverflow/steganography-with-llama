        "This is the story of a stolen book, a sense of national pride and some creative sleuthing. The book in question is a first edition copy of One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez. In 2015, it was stolen from a Bogota, Colombia, book fair. Many cases in that city go unsolved because of a lack of resources, but local law enforcement went all out to solve this crime. In its new season, the podcast Radio Ambulante tells the story of how the book was recovered.",
        "A lot of fake and misleading news stories were shared across social media during the election. One that got a lot of traffic had this headline: \u201dFBI Agent Suspected In Hillary Email Leaks Found Dead In Apparent .\u201d The story is completely false, but it was shared on Facebook over half a million times. We wondered who was behind that story and why it was written. It appeared on a site that had the look and feel of a local newspaper. Denverguardian. com even had the local weather. But it had only one news story \u2014 the fake one.",
        "If the children are the future, the future might be very . That\u2019s one implication of a new study from Stanford researchers that evaluated students\u2019 ability to assess information sources and described the results as \u201ddismaying,\u201d \u201dbleak\u201d and \u201d[a] threat to democracy.\u201d As content creators and social media platforms grapple with the fake news crisis, the study highlights the other side of the equation: What it looks like when readers are duped. The researchers at Stanford\u2019s Graduate School of Education have spent more than a year evaluating how well students across the country can evaluate online sources of information.",
        "Donald Trump issued a Thanksgiving address on Wednesday evening, calling for the nation to come together after a bruising, bitter campaign. \u201dIt is my prayer, that on this Thanksgiving, we begin to heal our divisions and move forward as one country, strengthened by a shared purpose and very, very common resolve,\u201d Trump said in the nearly video posted the night before the holiday. The incoming president acknowledged that the past year has taken a toll on the country. \u201dEmotions are raw and tensions just don\u2019t heal overnight,\u201d he admitted.",
        "On a night that the national election results had her discouraged, Seattle resident Anne Johnson had at least one ballot measure to celebrate: ST3, which will raise the local sales tax in the area to help pump $54 billion into expanding the region\u2019s rail and bus systems. It passed by a wide margin. \u201dThat is awesome, and we\u2019ve put a lot of work into that, and I\u2019m excited for the direction that that will take Seattle,\u201d says Johnson, who adds that the transit improvements will help people get to their jobs, to school and will have environmental benefits, too.",
        "Over the weekend, a sizable gaggle of the white nationalist \u201d \u201d convened at a federal building in Washington, D. C. to puff their chests. It was a motley crew, emboldened by the election of Donald Trump, with whom they shared a broad aversion to immigration and contempt for \u201dpolitical correctness.\u201d Their views were finally flitting around the mainstream of American politics.",
        "Donald Trump has picked billionaire Betsy DeVos, a Michigan Republican activist and philanthropist who is a strong supporter of school choice but has limited experience with public education, as his secretary of education. DeVos, 58, is a former chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party and helped push a failed 2000 ballot proposal to amend the Michigan state Constitution to create a voucher system for students to attend nonpublic schools. DeVos is chairman of The Windquest Group, a investment management company. She is married to billionaire Richard DeVos Jr.",
        "South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has been selected as U. S. ambassador to the United Nations in Donald Trump\u2019s administration, according to Trump\u2019s transition team. Haley has accepted the position, which requires Senate confirmation. NPR State Department correspondent Michele Kelemen reports the position was elevated to Cabinet rank by President George W. Bush and that President Barack Obama kept the designation. But Kelemen says the job of U. N. ambassador was not traditionally and it\u2019s unclear whether Trump will maintain that status.",
        "Heritage breed turkeys are making a comeback. These birds taste more like the turkeys that Native Americans and settlers ate in the 17th century, compared to today\u2019s Butterball turkeys. Just 20 years ago, some heritage turkey breeds were nearly extinct. For instance, in 1997 there were fewer than 10 Narragansett breeding birds left. Today, there are more than 2, 000, according to a new census from The Livestock Conservancy. \u201dIt\u2019s impressive,\u201d says Richard McCarthy, executive director of Slow Food USA.",
        "A woman protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline who was wounded earlier this week might lose her arm as a result of the injury, her family says. Sophia Wilansky\u2019s injury is the most gruesome to date of the standoff at Standing Rock, N. D. \u201dThe doctor just said she may need as many as 20 surgeries over very many months to have any hope of saving her arm and her hand,\u201d Wilansky\u2019s father, Wayne Wilansky, told a group of reporters outside a Minneapolis hospital.",
        "A team of atmospheric scientists researching pollution in China say they\u2019ve cracked a mystery \u2014 with research that explains not only the haze over Beijing, but also the remarkably toxic Great Smog of London from 1952. By examining conditions in China and experimenting in a lab, the scientists suggest that a combination of weather patterns and chemistry could have caused London\u2019s fog to turn into a haze of concentrated sulfuric acid. In the middle of the last century, London was no stranger to oppressive fogs laced with smoke from coal fires.",
        "The annual turkey pardon is a silly tradition, and President Obama knows it. On Wednesday, before pardoning turkeys named Tater and Tot, Obama summed up his feelings about this particular duty. \u201dIt is my great privilege \u2014 well, it\u2019s my privilege \u2014 actually, let\u2019s just say it\u2019s my job to grant them clemency this afternoon,\u201d Obama said. Not in attendance for the president\u2019s final turkey pardoning ceremony were first daughters Sasha and Malia Obama, who gamely laughed alongside their father last year.",
        "Editor\u2019s note: This story was originally posted last year. Some information was updated on Nov. 22, 2016. The annual presidential turkey pardoning event at the White House is a strange one. This year is President Obama\u2019s eighth and last one, but he still seems confused. \u201dIt is a little puzzling that I do this every year,\u201d Obama said in 2014. \u201dI know some folks think this tradition is a little silly,\u201d he said a year later. \u201dI do not disagree.\u201d The president has made the event something of an annual dad joke.",
        "Music historians, biographers and diehard fans have always had a keen interest in session reels, the unedited studio banter and outtakes from recording sessions. With the release of Freedom Jazz Dance, the fifth volume of Miles Davis\u2019 The Bootleg Series, avid listeners will have access to over two hours of previously unreleased recordings \u2014 including dialogue from studio sessions. When I first got my hands on the Miles Davis Quintet\u2019s session reels, I felt like I\u2019d walked right into their studio and taken a seat in the sound booth.",
        "Spoiler alert: This post refers to key elements of the movie. The audience around me was stunned silent at the end of Arrival, the new movie about a visit from advanced extraterrestrial beings based on Ted Chiang\u2019s short story. A movie about language, about how to communicate with creatures vastly different from us, left people in the seats speechless. Death, loss, despair, loneliness, perseverance, wisdom, love. Time holds the key to existence. To survival. Contact with an alien intelligence would be, perhaps, the most transformative experience for our species.",
        "It\u2019s Thanksgiving, which means you\u2019ll be seeing Aunt Martha\u2019s sweet potato casserole encased in a marshmallow cloud that has drifted too close to the sun. Cousin Joe, who\u2019s just here for the game, will bring his famous cranberry sauce that looks like it\u2019s been attacked by a Slinky. Then your sister will arrive with her sad concoction of green beans drowning in soup, flecked with floating onion strings that have been flung like debris from the Titanic. There\u2019s a certain charm to these standbys, and by golly, you might even like them.",
        "Before you pass that gravy this Thanksgiving, you may want to make sure you got what you paid for. Food giant Heinz is voluntarily recalling hundreds of cases of gravy just ahead of turkey day due to jars being possibly mislabeled. The labeling mishap was for Heinz HomeStyle Bistro Au Jus Gravy. The jars in question were inadvertently labeled Heinz Pork Gravy and may contain milk and soy. The Food and Drug Administration issued an alert via Twitter citing \u201dundeclared milk and soy\u201d in the HomeStyle.",
        "OK Go\u2019s latest (and astonishing) video, for the song \u201dThe One Moment,\u201d took only 4. 2 seconds to film. But the whole thing \u2014 a series of explosions \u2014 was slowed down to fill the minutes it takes the band to sing the song. Remarkably, like OK Go\u2019s previous videos, the group manages to sync the whole thing using. .. I don\u2019t know, math? \u201dYou\u2019re right,\u201d frontman and director Damian Kulash sings, his image animated as bassist Tim Nordwind flips through a book.",
        "Desperate Haitian immigrants have been massing along the U. S. border for months seeking humanitarian relief. In the past year more than 5, 000 have sought entry into the United States \u2014 a 500 percent increase over the previous year. After the catastrophic 2010 earthquake in Haiti, thousands of citizens migrated to Brazil looking for work. But as Brazil has slipped into recession in recent years, many of them have hit the road again, heading north on a journey to the U. S. border \u2014 by every means of conveyance.",
        "Infectious diseases are no longer the major killers in the U. S. that they once were, but they still surprise us. According to a report published Tuesday in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association, deaths from infectious disease accounted for 5. 4 percent of deaths from 1980 to 2014. That\u2019s a big change from 1900, when infectious diseases like pneumonia, tuberculosis and diarrhea accounted for almost half of all deaths.",
        "Imagine a wave so big it darkens the horizon as it rolls in. Just south of San Francisco, this surf spot is called Mavericks. Sarah Gerhardt is the first women to surf this famously dangerous spot. She did that in 1999 when she was 24. Now, at 42, she\u2019s one of six women comprising the first women\u2019s heat in a surfing contest there. The women will compete for $30, 000 in the Titans of Mavericks, surfing waves that swell well beyond 30 feet.",
        "Astronauts at the International Space Station are planning to spend Thanksgiving in quite a traditional fashion: There will be a turkey dinner with all the trimmings, good company, and football. In a video taped in orbit, Space Station Commander Shane Kimbrough explains how the crewmates will celebrate the holiday. \u201dIt\u2019s going to be little bit different for us up here in space, but I\u2019m going to try to make it as much like home as we can,\u201d he says. The crew will work during the day and then sit down to a Thanksgiving dinner.",
        "Thanksgiving came early in Poolesville. Only, instead of dining on turkey, the hundreds who gathered in this Maryland town actually dined with a turkey. His name is Perry. The strutting turkey, who\u2019s something of a star at Poplar Animal Sanctuary, stared down the hungry crowd with nothing to worry about \u2014 because the big dinner in Poolesville was no ordinary Thanksgiving feast: The diners there were only interested in vegan fare. Every year, they gather to forego the traditional dinner of turkey or pork roast, and instead eat vegan or vegetarian dishes right alongside the chickens, pigs and sheep.",
        "Every holiday season, things get a \u201dbit tricky,\u201d says Risa Greene, 53, from New York City. \u201dYou have one child who is a human garbage disposal and will eat anything you put in front of him, and you have another child who is more restricted than [the] TSA.\u201d Greene\u2019s son is an omnivore \u2014 he eats everything. Her daughter, Jessica, is a vegan. She stopped eating meat when she was in high school years ago, then dropped dairy products and eggs in college and eventually gave up gluten, too.",
        "For the second year in a row, the annual All Things Considered Thanksgiving music chat is a conversation. Host Ari Shapiro welcomes four musicians, each of whom was named by one of his or her fellow guests as an artist to be thankful for. The chain begins with Shapiro\u2019s pick: British soul Laura Mvula. Hear all four interviews at the audio link on this page, and read excerpts below.",
        "While North Dakota\u2019s Standing Rock Sioux Tribe continues to protest the Dakota Access Pipeline, it\u2019s a somewhat different situation 150 miles northwest. There, alongside the same river, pipelines and oil development are for the most part welcomed on a different reservation. On Fort Berthold, tribal members live right on top of pipelines \u2014 more than 4, 000 miles crisscross the reservation, home to the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara tribes that together call themselves MHA Nation. The reservation lies in the heart of the Bakken formation oil patch, and like seemingly everything here, there\u2019s a analysis to make.",
        "Somehow we\u2019re squeezing 18 people into our apartment for Thanksgiving this year, a year when too many people are worrying about fraught conversations. My relatives, who luckily are all cut from the same political cloth, range in age from my mother, aged 92, to my nephew (my granddaughter\u2019s political leanings are still unfolding.) I love them all, but in a way the one I know best is the man across the table whose blue eyes look just like mine: my younger brother Paul.",
        "Japan has the dubious title of the oldest society in the world, with one in four of its citizens past the age of 65. And while the image of the elderly is typically of sweet grandparents, in Japan, senior citizens are committing petty crimes like shoplifting in bigger numbers than teenagers. Inside the office of a private security firm in Tokyo are video monitors that take up the entire wall, bisected into 16 boxes showing various camera angles on a nearby business. Mochizuku Morio shows us a live feed of a grocery store that\u2019s a few blocks away.",
        "Vice Mike Pence went to see the hit Broadway musical Hamilton last week, setting off a chain of events that lead to a big headache for a small community theater in Montana. At the end of Friday night\u2019s performance in New York, actor Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays Vice President Aaron Burr, called on Pence to work for all Americans. \u201dWe, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir,\u201d Dixon said."
