        "Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said on Septemb\u2026 The accord, which was struck earlier this month, follows an October referendum in which the country narrowly voted to reject a peace agreement reached in September. Voters opposed the September peace deal for its \u201dperceived leniency toward FARC fighters,\u201d as my colleague Colin Dwyer wrote, but Santos was still awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts.",
        "Scaffolding at a construction site in eastern China collapsed, killing at least 74 workers. Chinese state media reported it was the country\u2019s worst accident in more than two years.

        "On this day of giving thanks, I\u2019ve put together a list of things for which I\u2019m grateful. Here they are in no particular order: 10. This video. It brings a smile every time I watch. Don\u2019t miss the moment when the chase reverses direction! 9. Elephant compassion caught on film. Just look at how these wild elephants in China, through their nearness and their touch, comfort their companions who are trapped in a pond. A happy ending ensues, thanks to the local forestry police. 8. Human compassion for elephants.",
        "I celebrated my first Thanksgiving in 2002. I\u2019d arrived in the United States in August of that year to start graduate school at the University of Missouri, Columbia. A few months later, I was invited to my first Thanksgiving dinner at a house shared by two Indians, one American, two New Zealanders and their sweet black Labrador, named Willow. There was no turkey. The couple from New Zealand \u2014 the cooks in the house \u2014 were vegan, so they made tofurky and lots of vegetables. It was a delicious meal.",
        "The sweet potato has a secret identity. It\u2019s not just the food upon which marshmallows are heaped and maple syrup is poured to celebrate the holiday of Thanksgiving. It is also a staple of the African diet. And Africans who eat it feel passionately about it. For some, it kindles warm memories. For some, it\u2019s a neglected food that deserves a higher profile because of its nutritional value. And some people can\u2019t stand it! On the eve of Thanksgiving, we\u2019re stepping outside the U. S. sweet potato zone to see how the vegetable is regarded across the ocean.",
        "You may not remember what you were doing a few minutes ago. But your dog probably does. A study of 17 dogs found they could remember and imitate their owners\u2019 actions up to an hour later. The results, published Wednesday in Current Biology, suggest that dogs can remember and relive an experience much the way people do. That\u2019s probably not a big surprise to people who own dogs, says Claudia Fugazza, an author of the study and an animal behavior researcher at Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest. Fugazza owns a Czechoslovakian Wolfdog named Velvet.",

Along the way, we\u2019ve all discovered stuff we hadn\u2019t heard before \u2014 and even fallen in love with some of it. On this week\u2019s show, Bob and I share some of the artists and albums we missed before now, from Caribbean roots music by Anthony Joseph to the funk group Lettuce and the idiosyncratic pop of D.

        "For yuletide misanthropes nationwide, Bad Santa has become a kind of alternative holiday tradition, the shot of Wild Turkey spiking the eggnog. What\u2019s forgotten is that Terry Zwigoff\u2019s delectably nasty 2003 comedy was a hit despite a bitter struggle between Zwigoff and the studio, Miramax, which decided the film needed \u201dheart,\u201d did reshoots (some without Zwigoff\u2019s participation) and released the film as a parent might release a soiled diaper.",

        "Strict bans on ivory trade are aimed at preventing elephant poaching. But the state and federal measures are causing unintended consequences for Alaska Natives who legally hunt walruses and carve their tusks for a living. Among dozens of tables at a recent craft fair in Fairbanks, Alaska, the glitter and gleam of Dennis Pungowiyi\u2019s ivory stands out. He has everything from small sculptures of birds to curved cribbage boards etched into tusks. \u201dI\u2019m more for my walruses,\u201d Pungowiyi says.",
        "On Thanksgiving Day 40 years ago, some rock \u2019n\u2019 roll fans in California were treated to a musical feast. They were at an old rink and music hall in San Francisco called the Winterland Ballroom, and a beloved band was saying goodbye. The name of this band? As simple as it gets: The Band. They called their 1976 farewell concert \u201dThe Last Waltz,\u201d and the star cast who wanted to share this moment with them included Eric Clapton, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell and Bob Dylan.

        "We are all in transition these days. Washington is getting used to the idea of a new and very different president, who is getting used to the idea of Washington. One thing we are learning about the mind of Donald Trump is that his train of thought rarely runs on a single track. Consider the Cabinet announcements this week, dramatically at odds with those of the previous week. Trump named South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley as United Nations ambassador and school choice advocate Betsy DeVos as secretary of education.",
        "Donald Trump says he has a simple goal in mind when it comes to federal regulations. In a video he released Monday, Trump said he \u201dwill formulate a rule that says that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. So important.\u201d There are some 80, 000 pages in the Federal Register, where all regulations are published. So it should be a simple task to pare back some of them. Wrong. \u201dIt\u2019s generally not easy to do that,\u201d says Susan Dudley, who heads the Regulatory Studies Center at George Washington University.",

        "The 21st Century Cures Act now being refined by the lame duck Congress is one of the health care bills in recent history, with nearly three lobbyists working for its passage or defeat for every lawmaker on Capitol Hill. More than 1, 455 lobbyists representing 400 companies, universities and other organizations pushed for or against a House version of a Cures bill this congressional cycle, according to federal disclosure forms compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.

        "Most television shows arrive accompanied by the question, \u201dIs it good?\u201d Revivals of old shows, however, often arrive with the question, \u201dIs it necessary?\u201d The four new installments of Gilmore Girls that arrived Friday on Netflix under the title Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life fare better by that adjusted standard than most. Gilmore Girls, which ran from 2000 to 2007, was a good show, and because creator Amy left before the seventh and final season following a contractual dispute, she didn\u2019t get to end it the way she wanted to.",
