        "Some people had been girding for battle for weeks others, meanwhile, had been practicing their evasive maneuvers. Some even gave up on the looming fights entirely, heading for safer shores \u2014 alone, with takeout, or a good book. It\u2019s tough to blame them. After a particularly brutal election season, Thanksgiving this year had many people feeling nervous about family conversations around the table. In a year riven by a deep partisan divide, the holiday promised more than a little friction with the feasts. But did it really pan out that way?",
        "On a recent fall morning, a large crowd clogged the steps at one of Venice\u2019s main tourist sites, the Rialto Bridge. But on this day, there was a twist: it was filled with Venetians, not tourists. \u201dPeople are cheering and holding their carts in the air,\u201d says Giovanni Claudio Di Giorgio, who helped organize the march with a organization called Generazione \u201990. The carts he refers to are small shopping carts \u2014 the symbol of a true Venetian. \u201dIt started as a joke,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201dThe idea was to put blades on the wheels! You know?",
        "At the huge weekly market on the outskirts of Cairo, live chickens crowd wooden cages next to tables piled with pomegranates, persimmons and baskets of fresh dates from the countryside. But as Egypt endures its worst economic crisis in decades, many shoppers can barely afford the tomatoes and cucumbers that are a staple of the poor. They hurry past to a nearby square in the hope of buying cartons of food. Egypt is the Arab world\u2019s most populous country, with more than 90 million people, and one of the world\u2019s biggest food importers.",
        "Florence Henderson, who went from Broadway star to become one of America\u2019s most beloved television moms in The Brady Bunch, has died, her manager and her publicist said. She was 82. Henderson died Thursday night at Medical Center in Los Angeles, after being hospitalized the day before, said her publicist, David Brokaw. Henderson had suffered heart failure, her manager Kayla Pressman said in a statement. Family and friends had surrounded Henderson\u2019s hospital bedside, Pressman said.",
        "There are a lot of things that make holidays hectic: travel, cooking, making small talk and avoiding questions from your relatives about who you\u2019re dating and how school\u2019s going. That\u2019s typically part of what comes with holidays, but the chaos and disorder that accompany Black Friday, not even a true holiday, are something else. In response to this chaos, some companies like REI are working to give people an alternative to the shoving and spending they might otherwise do.",
        "A man was fatally shot following a dispute in a parking lot in Reno, Nevada, on Thanksgiving night, police say. The incident began about 6 p. m. on Thursday. Local news station KOLO reported that \u201dthere was apparently a dispute over a parking spot\u201d and said police characterized the shooting as a road rage incident. Reno Police said two vehicles stopped near the exit of the parking lot, The Associated Press reported.",
        "A \u201dconversation\u201d between two major artists \u2014 Henri Matisse of France, and Richard Diebenkorn of the U. S. \u2014 is taking place on the walls of the Baltimore Museum of Art. The two artists never met, but Matisse influenced Diebenkorn\u2019s work, across decades and continents. Matisse\u2019s and Diebenkorn\u2019s daughter got to see the exhibition before it opened to the public Gretchen Diebenkorn Grant, 71, and Sophie Matisse, 51, met for the first time at the Baltimore Museum of Art. \u201dMy whole life we all looked at Matisse the whole time,\u201d Grant tells Matisse. \u201dThat\u2019s funny, me too,\u201d Matisse laughs.",
        "Voters in California officially ended the era of instruction in public schools and lifted restrictions on bilingual education that had been in place for 18 years. Proposition 58 passed by a percent margin. What happens next though, could get complicated. Classrooms won\u2019t change this school year because the measure doesn\u2019t kick in until July 2017. Until then, state and school district officials need to figure out three big things: 1. How many schools will actually begin to offer bilingual or dual language instruction? 2. Will it cost more for schools to have this offering? 3.",
        "In his defining moments on screen, Toshiro Mifune was glowering and silent, as if careful not to let slip a hint of his next move. To judge by Mifune: The Last Samurai, he was much the same off screen. Of the surviving friends, colleagues, and family members interviewed for this instructive but staid and unsurprising documentary, none has anything startling to reveal. That\u2019s not because the subject is Mifune, of course. Japanese culture doesn\u2019t encourage people to disclose their deepest feelings, which might be embarrassing or disruptive.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign said Saturday it will participate in the recount efforts in Wisconsin spearheaded by Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein. If Stein also pursues recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan, as she has pledged, the Clinton campaign will participate in those efforts, as well. The recount in Wisconsin could begin as early as next week.",
        "Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan agree that repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with some other health insurance system is a top priority. But they disagree on whether overhauling Medicare should be part of that plan. Medicare is the health system for people age 65 and older and the disabled. Trump said little about Medicare during his campaign, other than to promise that he wouldn\u2019t cut it. Ryan, on the other hand, has Medicare in his sights. \u201dBecause of Obamacare, Medicare is going broke,\u201d Ryan said in an interview on Fox News on Nov. 10.",
        "This month\u2019s election results could have big implications for those who now have insurance because of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 either through the exchanges or Medicaid expansion. Trump and Republicans in Congress have made it clear they want to scrap the law, but it\u2019s unclear what may replace it. That gap between repeal and replacement has left many unsure of what will happen with their medical care. We have these reports from around the country from people who could be affected by changes.

        "Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro has died at age 90, according to Cuban state media, confirms NPR. Castro, who took power in the Cuban Revolution in 1959, led his country for nearly 50 years. After undergoing intestinal surgery, Castro had ceded power in July 2006 to his younger brother Raul, who announced his death late Friday on Cuban state television. Under Fidel Castro\u2019s direction, Cuba became the one and only communist state in the Western Hemisphere. One of the most prominent international figures in the last half of the 20th century, Castro inspired both passionate love and hate.",
        "Fidel Castro, the controversial ruler who took power during the Cuban revolution in 1959 and led his country for nearly half a century, died in Havana, Cuba, at age 90. Castro lived through 10 U. S. presidents who were determined to overthrow him, as NPR\u2019s Tom Gjelten reported, in addition to surviving the collapse of the communist alliance that bolstered his success. The former president has suffered ill health since undergoing emergency intestinal surgery in July 2006, when he ceded power to his younger brother, Ra\u00fal, who formally assumed the presidency in 2008.",
        "I always had a wonderful time in Fidel Castro\u2019s Cuba, and usually wound up feeling bad about it. The island is beautiful, the people even sunnier: warm and friendly, especially to Americans. The responsables \u2014 government minders \u2014 assigned to each reporting crew would tease me about being from Chicago. \u201dYour mobsters used to run this place,\u201d they\u2019d say. \u201dSam Giancana, The Godfather. You made our men bellboys and our women prostitutes.\u201d And then they\u2019d treat you to mojitos and fabulous music.",
        "Andy Grammer\u2019s latest single, \u201dFresh Eyes,\u201d is a love song \u2014 but it grew in meaning when he filmed the music video on Skid Row in Los Angeles. Over the course of the video shoot, the pop singer and his team provided haircuts, clean clothes, meals and kindness to people seeking shelter at the Union Rescue Mission in L. A. \u201dWe probably spent, I don\u2019t know, eight to 10 hours down there, just to really get to know people and share some love with them,\u201d Grammer says.",
        "What do Democrats in West Virginia and Republicans in California have in common? Many likely knew that their presidential election votes wouldn\u2019t \u201dcount.\u201d Of course, these votes were counted, but anyone with a minimal knowledge of U. S. politics could have guessed that California would vote Democratic in the presidential election (Clinton won it by 29 points) and that West Virginia would go Republican (Trump won by nearly 42 points).",
        "Michigan moved one step closer to certifying its statewide presidential election results Friday. Counties there finished canvassing and making their results official, and while Hillary Clinton picked up a few thousand votes, Donald Trump is still more than 10, 000 votes ahead. That\u2019s a tiny fraction of the statewide vote, the closest in the state\u2019s presidential history. The state will officially certify Trump the winner Monday. That will give him well over 300 electoral votes, a veritable electoral landslide.",
        "Tourists are drawn to the shores of Lugu Lake in southwest China by tales of an exotic \u201dKingdom of Daughters,\u201d where the women of the Mosuo ethnic group head one of the world\u2019s relatively rare matrilineal societies. In fact, the tourists have created their share of problems over the years. The Mosuo\u2019s \u201dwalking marriages,\u201d in which Mosuo women traditionally were allowed to have multiple lovers, have enticed some tourists to try to take liberties with local women. \u201dSo we have to beat them up,\u201d says Mosuo tour guide Geze Duoji.",
        "The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers notified the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe on Friday that the public will not be allowed in areas being used to protest the Dakota Access Pipeline.

        "Do you know any global health stories that should be getting coverage \u2014 but are overlooked by the media? That\u2019s the question behind the Untold Global Health Stories contest, sponsored by the Goats and Soda blog, Global Health Now and the Consortium of Universities for Global Health (CUGH). The goal is to bring vital but neglected stories to the public eye. We invite our readers to nominate a health issue that deserves urgent attention but has largely been underreported or ignored by the media. We\u2019d suggest focusing on a specific problem in a specific part of the world.",
        "Jack London, who died 100 years ago this week, occupies a space in which few writers can set foot. Although it\u2019s not especially unique for writers\u2019 lives to be marked by sickness and excess, London was prolific despite these constant threats to his productivity. Even as illness loomed, he managed to publish over 50 books and hundreds of articles in the last 16 years of his life. At a young age, London developed a hard discipline for writing \u2014 often jotting down as many as 1, 000 words a day and getting by on little sleep.",
        "When archaeologist Layla Salih was a schoolgirl in Mosul, Iraq, she visited the ancient site of Nimrud for the first time on a field trip, led by a guide past the remnants of temples and roads to the ancient palace of Ashurnasirpal II.

        "In 11th grade, some students in India read a story that\u2019s not your typical textbook fare. It\u2019s about a girl whose marriage was arranged when she was just one year old. When she turned 18, her parents ordered her to leave home and join her husband. Only she went to court to protest. That\u2019s the true story of Laxmi Sagara of Rajasthan. Working with a social psychologist and with Kriti Bharti, founder of the women and children\u2019s rights nonprofit Saarthi Trust, she won the case in 2012 and subsequently married the man of her choice.",
        "Donald Trump won a convincing electoral vote victory on Nov. 8, but he is claiming falsely that widespread voter fraud cost him the popular vote. The latest totals show Hillary Clinton leading Trump in the popular vote by more than 2 million. Trump tweeted on Sunday afternoon, \u201dI won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\u201d He did not provide evidence to back up that claim, and Trump\u2019s representatives did not immediately respond to a request for more information.",
        "When you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you. Cards Against Humanity, the maker of the game of the same name, announced last week it would be celebrating Black Friday by digging a giant, pointless hole in the ground. The company named it the Holiday Hole, and said it would dig the hole for as long as people were willing to pay for it. The dig lasted for days and ended on Sunday.",
        "Picture this: You\u2019re at a park, on a walk, with a baby. A friendly man approaches you and tells you your stroller could be really dangerous. You might think this man is crazy. But maybe not if you knew he\u2019s the nation\u2019s product safety chief. \u201dI couldn\u2019t live with myself if I walked away and it turned out that that child was harmed when I could\u2019ve just said something,\u201d Elliot Kaye says.",
        "Katie Melua has become one of the U. K.\u2019s most popular young musicians, with six studio albums already to her name. She began her life in the Union country of Georgia, on the coast of the Black Sea. \u201dWhen the Soviet Union broke down, Georgia suffered a huge deal,\u201d she says. \u201dPretty much the whole of the 90\u2019s was known as \u2019the black decade . .. because we had a lot of electricity blackouts.\u201d This meant that schools would close during the winter because there wasn\u2019t enough power to warm the rooms.",
        "Your posters. The color of your walls. The size of your bed. Where you sleep says a lot about who you are. That\u2019s the idea behind photographer and filmmaker John Thackwray\u2019s photo series My Room Project. Six years ago, Thackwray started photographing his friends in their Parisian bedrooms to capture their style, interests and hobbies. He slowly expanded the project to include the rooms of young people from Nepal to Romania to Mexico. He wanted to document the diverse lifestyles of the millennial generation \u2014 people born in the \u201980s and \u201990s \u2014 and show how they express themselves."
