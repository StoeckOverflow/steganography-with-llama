        "Homeopathy has been around since the 1700s, but despite having devoted followers, there is no scientific evidence that it works. Soon, packages for homeopathic products might say just that. On Nov. 15, the Federal Trade Commission released an enforcement policy statement about labeling for homeopathic products. Homeopathic treatments have increasingly been marketed in drug store and supermarket aisles, alongside Food and Drug medications like Tylenol and Mucinex. Some homeopathic remedies have disclaimers that say their products aren\u2019t regulated by the FDA. Some don\u2019t have any disclaimers at all.",

        "On Donald Trump\u2019s visit to Carrier in Indiana on Thursday, he mentioned a phone call that he made to the CEO of United Technologies, the air conditioning company\u2019s parent. As Trump describes it, that call led to Carrier announcing it will not move as many jobs to Mexico as it had planned. \u201dWe can\u2019t allow this to happen anymore with our country. So many jobs are leaving and going to other countries, not just Mexico,\u201d Trump said. Trump made it sound as though the decision to keep 1, 000 Carrier jobs in the U. S.",

The books were full of meaty aspics and mousses coaxed into elaborate shapes: a crown made of blunted hot dogs, seafood mousse sculpted into the shape of a maniacally grinning fish. Pallai started posting snapshots of the recipes on Facebook, then migrated her impromptu archive to Twitter so she wouldn\u2019t clog her friends\u2019 news feeds.",

But for many Americans, it grabbed their attention in the early months of this year, in the aftermath of the Dec. 2, 2015, mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. It was a saga that unraveled over weeks. Looking for leads on the terrorist\u2019s iPhone, the FBI wanted to crack the PIN code on the device.

She was overwhelmed by their beauty \u2014 and then suddenly, as if in a dream, she was out somewhere in deep space instead. \u201dOh, wow,\u201d she thought, overwhelmed all over again. She had been an amateur skydiver in her youth, but this sensation didn\u2019t come with any sense of speeding or falling or even having a body at all. She was just hovering there, gazing at the universe.",
        "The Army Corps of Engineers has denied a permit for the construction of a key section of the Dakota Access Pipeline, granting a major victory to protesters who have been demonstrating for months. The decision essentially halts the construction of the oil pipeline just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation.

        "Italian voters have dealt a serious defeat to the government of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. In a referendum Sunday, they rejected Renzi\u2019s proposed constitutional reforms, which would have changed the balance of power between the executive and Parliament. The \u201dno\u201d vote is expected to win by a margin of nearly 20 percentage points, in what is seen as a resounding message of discontent with Renzi\u2019s government.
