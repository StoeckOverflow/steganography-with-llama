        "Donald Trump and his supporters went to court Friday to prevent or halt election recounts in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, less than two weeks before the states would have to complete the tasks to meet a federal deadline to certify their election results. The legal actions seeking to block or halt the recounts in three states Trump narrowly won could cause delays that would make them extremely difficult or impossible to complete on time. Even if the recounts happen, though, none would be expected to give Democrat Hillary Clinton enough votes to emerge as the winner.",
        "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act first and replace it sometime later. That doesn\u2019t sit well with Victoria Barton, who lives in McCarthy\u2019s rural California district. \u201dIt\u2019s like they dangled the carrot and now they\u2019re taking it away,\u201d said Barton, 38, of Bakersfield, an unpaid photographer and mother of two. Barton and her husband, a contract computer technician, had been uninsured for most of their adult lives. When Obamacare expanded Medicaid, they were finally able to qualify for the health program.",
        "To see the effect that xenophobia, and populist rage can have on a nation\u2019s culture, we need look no further than the life of Albert Einstein. Germany in Einstein\u2019s lifetime had never been particularly hospitable to Jews, but by the early 1920s, German Jews like him were being treated like aliens in their own land. In 1922, when the Jewish foreign minister of Germany, Walter Rathenau, was assassinated \u2014 to the glee of conservatives across the country \u2014 Einstein realized that serious danger was beginning for prominent Jews like himself.",
        "In Florida, oranges are so important that they\u2019re on the state\u2019s license plates. But after 11 years of fighting a debilitating disease, Florida\u2019s citrus industry is in a sad state. The disease, called citrus greening, is caused by a bacterium that constricts a tree\u2019s vascular system, shriveling fruit and eventually killing the tree. The bacterium is spread by a tiny insect called a psyllid. Florida\u2019s signature orange crop is now less than a third of what it was 20 years ago because of this disease. And the U. S.",
        "Dear Sugar Radio is a weekly podcast from member station WBUR. Hosts Steve Almond and Cheryl Strayed offer \u201dradical empathy\u201d and advice on everything from relationships and parenthood to dealing with drug problems or anxiety. Today the Sugars talk about money \u2014 specifically, how money and traditional gender roles affect a relationship. A woman writes that she was initially attracted to her husband\u2019s power and income. But he changed jobs and now she makes the vast majority of their combined income. Now, she says she\u2019s not happy being the main breadwinner and thinks about ending her marriage.",
        "Pandemic flu, Ebola, Nipah virus. Emmie de Wit has held all of them in her hands (with three layers of gloves in between, of course).

        "In what may be the most unlikely meeting of the presidential transition process so far, former vice president, former Democratic presidential nominee, former senator and Nobel Peace Prize winner Al Gore met with Donald Trump on Monday. Gore has spent decades warning about the dire consequences of unchecked, climate change, while Trump has regularly called climate change \u201da hoax\u201d during the campaign. Initially, the session was not even expected to include the . According to the transition spokesman, it was scheduled as a between Gore and Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka, who is a member of the official transition team.",
        "Trying to understand the Trump Organization is a daunting task. Donald Trump has not released tax documents, so the best clues about his privately held business interests come from a financial disclosure form he released in May. The document covers scores of pages with small type, and suggests he is financially involved with hundreds of companies, including some that simply license his name. A sort through that disclosure form, submitted to the Office of Government Ethics, shows his largest sources of revenue are golf courses and rents.",

        "Fake news stories can have consequences. On Sunday, police said a man with a rifle who claimed to be \u201d \u201d a baseless online conspiracy theory entered a Washington, D. C. pizzeria and fired the weapon inside the restaurant. So, yes, fake news is a big problem. These stories have gotten a lot of attention, with headlines claiming Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump in November\u2019s election and sites like American News sharing misleading stories or taking quotes out of context.",

        "Italian archaeologists discovered the plundered tomb of Queen Nefertari in Egypt\u2019s Valley of the Queens in 1904, and amid the debris, they found a pair of mummified knees. Now, for the first time, researchers have conducted a broad array of tests on the knees and say they are confident they belong to Nefertari, who was the wife of Pharaoh Ramses II and one of the most famous of Egypt\u2019s queens. The knees, which are housed at the Egyptian Museum in Turin, Italy, have long been presumed to be hers.",
        "Just as the recount that he requested came to a conclusion, incumbent North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory conceded the gubernatorial election to Democratic state Attorney General Roy Cooper. With a message on YouTube, McCrory ended what he described as the \u201dclosest governor\u2019s race\u201d in North Carolina history. \u201dI personally believe that the majority of our citizens have spoken, and we now should do everything we can to support the 75th governor of North Carolina, Roy Cooper,\u201d McCrory said in the video statement.",
        "The fight over who invented a technology that could revolutionize medicine and agriculture heads to a courtroom Tuesday. A technology called could be worth billions of dollars. But it\u2019s not clear who owns the idea. U. S. patent judges will hear oral arguments to help untangle this issue, which has far more at stake than your patent dispute. \u201dThis is arguably the biggest biotechnology breakthrough in the past 30 or 40 years, and controlling who owns the foundational intellectual property behind that is consequentially pretty important,\u201d says Jacob Sherkow, a professor at the New York Law College.",
        "For about a decade, Turkish and Ghanaian organized crime rings operated a fake U. S. embassy in Ghana\u2019s capital, where they issued fraudulently obtained legitimate and counterfeit visas and ID documents costing $6, 000 to people from across West Africa. That\u2019s according to the U. S.

        "Meat was seldom on the menu when I was a kid. When we did eat it, my family\u2019s consisted of hot dogs (consumed once per year at my dad\u2019s work picnic) kung pao chicken from various local Chinese establishments, and my mom\u2019s tandoori chicken slathered in yogurt sauce. These dishes all followed my formerly vegetarian, reluctantly omnivorous Hindu parents\u2019 Cardinal Rule for Eating Meat: Meat should not resemble animal. Skin and bones were to be avoided, which meant that chicken wings and ribs were inherently problematic, as were Thanksgiving turkeys, which were replaced with lasagnas.",
        "After one of the founders of Corona beer died last summer at age 98, some news went viral: In his will, he\u2019d apparently left his fortune to the tiny, hardscrabble village in northern Spain where he was born. Each resident \u2014 mostly retired farmers and miners of meager means \u2014 would receive more than $2 million.

        "Italy is headed toward a period of political uncertainty following voters\u2019 crushing rejection of constitutional amendments and of their champion. The Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is slated to hand in his resignation Monday after only 2 years in office and after acknowledging his stinging defeat in Sunday\u2019s referendum. Just over an hour after the polls closed, Renzi appeared before the media. Usually brash and confident, he held back tears acknowledging defeat. \u201dI take full responsibility. In Italy, politicians never lose, they just hang on. But I lost and I say it loudly. This government,\u201d he added, \u201dis over.",
        "The man accused of killing nine people during a Bible study in Charleston, S. C. last year has rehired his defense attorneys to represent him in the first phase of his federal murder trial.

        "The people of southern Madagascar are on the brink of a famine and need immediate humanitarian aid, according to United Nations food agencies. A drought, exacerbated by this year\u2019s El Ni\u00f1o, has caused harvests to continue to fail. And people are left with no money and almost nothing to eat. Just over half the region\u2019s population, about 840, 000 people, is severely affected.

And then, someone shakes the table it\u2019s sitting on, and boom! It all comes crumbling down, leaving a huge, hole in your heart. Never again, we said. This year, we were determined to build a stronger gingerbread house. One that wouldn\u2019t crumble, no matter what. One that could withstand an earthquake. So we consulted Ben Schafer, chair of the department of civil engineering at Johns Hopkins.",

        "\u201d years ago, on a bright, cloudless morning, death fell from the sky and the world was changed,\u201d President Obama said Friday, in the first visit by a sitting U. S. president to Hiroshima, Japan. In 1945, the United States dropped the first atomic bomb used in warfare on that city, killing an estimated 140, 000 people. A second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki three days later. Within weeks, Japan surrendered, ending the war in the Pacific Theater.

        "years ago, President Franklin D. Roosevelt proclaimed Dec. 7, 1941, as a \u201ddate which will live in infamy\u201d after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. But that most powerful line in his speech asking Congress to declare war and bring the U. S. into World War II almost wasn\u2019t. Roosevelt\u2019s original draft called it \u201da date which will live in world history,\u201d rhetoric that had far less oomph.
