        "Editor\u2019s note: This story contains links to Facebook posts and videos that contain language that some may find offensive. Trae Crowder, until recently, was a comic with an idea for a Web series. He would call it, \u201dThe Liberal Redneck,\u201d and he\u2019d do liberal rants in his strong Tennessee accent, while wearing a camouflage hunting cap and a cutoff . But he thought he needed an expensive camera and high production values to get the series to take off. And that just wasn\u2019t in his budget.",
        "A full decade after the Food and Drug Administration approved a vaccine to fight the sexually transmitted, human papillomavirus, almost half of all adolescents have still not received their first dose. This low vaccination rate is dramatic when compared to other routine childhood immunizations like polio and measles, mumps and rubella, where compliance is above 90 percent. In order to boost HPV vaccination, doctors should be more assertive when bringing up the topic with parents, says Noel Brewer, a health and behavior scientist at the University of North Carolina.",
        "Vaccination rates against human papillomavirus have remained far lower than rates for other routine childhood and teen immunizations. But a big reason for those low rates comes from a surprising source. It\u2019s not hesitant parents refusing the vaccine. Rather, primary care doctors treat the HPV vaccine differently from other routinely recommended immunizations, hesitating to recommend it fully and on time and approaching their discussions with parents differently, a study finds.",
        "Donald Trump wants to clip the wings of a new Air Force One, saying the customized 747 is too expensive. \u201dThe plane is totally out of control,\u201d Trump told reporters Tuesday morning. \u201dI think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\u201d Earlier in the day, Trump tweeted that the new aircraft would cost more than $4 billion and urged the government to cancel the contract. Neither Trump nor his spokespeople said where that cost estimate came from.",
        "The U. S. stock market is up more than 3 percent since Election Day four weeks ago. One person who hasn\u2019t benefited: Donald Trump. In a call with reporters, transition spokesman Jason Miller says Trump sold all of his holdings in the stock market over the summer. The move could remove some, but not all, potential conflicts of interest as the billionaire businessman takes office as president. Even before the sale, stocks accounted for a tiny fraction of Trump\u2019s personal fortune. Most of his money is in real estate.",
        "A federal judge has overturned a military panel\u2019s decision to force a Marine out of service for using his Yahoo account to send an email that included classified information warning his fellow Marines about a corrupt Afghan official. That warning was not taken seriously, as NPR\u2019s Quil Lawrence told our Newscast unit, and three Marines were killed shortly after.",
        "He was a flamboyant, billionaire who said things no career politician ever would \u2014 someone who promised to use his business savvy to reform the system and bring back jobs. Voters believed that his great wealth insulated him from corruption, because he couldn\u2019t be bought. But his administration was marked by criminal investigations and crony capitalism.",
        "The Trump Organization has more interests in India \u2014 at least five \u2014 than anywhere else outside North America. With an taste for luxury, India offers the Trump brand a lucrative market, no matter who runs the company after Donald Trump separates from his global enterprises, as he\u2019s said he would do. While Mumbai real estate prices average $1, 000 per square foot for exclusive living, a drive away, past billboards beckoning the newly moneyed with images of infinity pools and palatial homes, luxury apartments in Pune seem like a bargain at $250 a square foot.",
        "The Lord\u2019s Resistance Army committed horrifying crimes against civilians for almost three decades, killing thousands in northern Uganda and beyond its borders. Now, the trial of an LRA commander has opened at the International Criminal Court. Dominic Ongwen, who was kidnapped when he was a boy and forced to become a child soldier, \u201dpleaded not guilty to 70 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity \u2014 including murder and enslavement,\u201d as NPR\u2019s Ofeibea reports.

        "Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube say they are creating a database to keep track of terrorist recruitment videos and other images that have been removed from their services. In a joint statement posted by Facebook on Monday, the company said: \u201dStarting today, we commit to the creation of a shared industry database of \u2019hashes\u2019 \u2014 unique digital \u2019fingerprints\u2019 \u2014 for violent terrorist imagery or terrorist recruitment videos or images that we have removed from our services.",
        "Judging from the deluge of recent movies featuring aliens of all sorts \u2014 Dr. Strange, Arrival, the upcoming Star Wars movie Rogue One \u2014 we can\u2019t help but be fascinated with these imaginary creatures. They live deep in our collective unconscious, mirroring the good and evil we are capable of. In a real sense, the aliens are us. They reflect what we know of the world and ourselves, our expectations and fears, our hopes and despair. But there is something else with aliens, something we rarely pause to consider.",

        "Amazon says it is opening a new food and convenience store that doesn\u2019t have a checkout line. Instead, the company envisions customers at the Amazon Go store picking up whatever they want off the shelves \u2014 then simply walking out with it. The items are automatically billed to their Amazon accounts. Details about how the technology actually works are sparse. \u201dWe used computer vision, deep learning algorithms and sensor fusion much like you\u2019d find in cars,\u201d a narrator says in a video from Amazon.",
        "The Supreme Court has weighed in on a patent battle between Samsung and Apple, siding with Samsung by declaring that the patent infringement for an element of a design should be treated differently from the infringement of an entire design. The dispute between the two tech giants isn\u2019t about whether Samsung violated Apple\u2019s patents, but rather about how much money it\u2019s reasonable for Samsung to pay for the infringement. Samsung previously had been ordered to pay Apple $399 million in damages.",
        "The U. S. Supreme Court has upheld a jury verdict finding that State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. defrauded the federal government after Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast in 2005. In the years before the hurricane, State Farm issued both federal flood insurance policies and general homeowners policies. After the hurricane, the company ordered its claims adjusters to misclassify wind damage as flood damage to shift liability to the government and spare the insurance company\u2019s coffers.",

        "The manager of the Oakland, Calif. warehouse that burned down, killing at least 36 people, apologized for the devastation while defending his vision for the \u201dGhost Ship\u201d artists\u2019 collective during an agonized, frequently tense interview on the Today show. After Matt Lauer welcomed him with \u201dgood morning,\u201d Derick Almena shook his head. \u201dIt\u2019s not a good morning,\u201d he said. \u201dWhat am I doing here?",
        "Sarah Lohman has made everything from cocktails to cakes with black pepper to stewed moose face. She is a historical gastronomist, which means she historical recipes to connect with the past. That recipe dates back to the 19th century, and it wasn\u2019t easy. She recalls spending hours trying to butcher the moose from Alaska in her kitchen in Queens, New York. She tried scalding the face in hot water to remove the fur, but it didn\u2019t quite work and her apartment stunk of wet moose.",
        "You\u2019d be forgiven for viewing nominations for the 59th Grammy Awards, announced Tuesday morning, as a battle between two powerhouse singers: Beyonc\u00e9, whose Lemonade leads the field with nine, and Adele, whose 25 has been a sales juggernaut since its release late last year. Both received Album Of The Year nods, as did Drake\u2019s Views, Sturgill Simpson\u2019s A Sailor\u2019s Guide to Earth and Justin Bieber\u2019s Purpose. When Bieber was nominated for the Best New Artist Grammy back in 2011, he lost to Esperanza Spalding, sparking an outcry from his army of fans.",

        "Frequent removal of pubic hair is associated with an increased risk for herpes, syphilis and human papillomavirus, doctors at the University of California, San Francisco, reported Monday in the journal Sexually Transmitted Infections. People who have \u201dmowed the lawn\u201d at least once in their lifetimes were nearly twice as likely to say they had had at least one STD. And \u201dextreme groomers\u201d \u2014 those who remove all their pubic hair more than 11 times each year \u2014 were more than four times as likely to have had an infection.",
        "The revelation of a phone call between Donald Trump and Taiwan President Tsai last Friday startled leaders and diplomats in Washington, Beijing and beyond. In her first comments on the call, Tsai sought to dampen those fears. \u201dOf course I have to stress that one phone call does not mean a policy shift,\u201d Tsai said on Tuesday in a small meeting with American journalists in Taipei. \u201dThe phone call was a way for us to express our respect for the U. S.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s unprecedented call with Taiwanese president Tsai has brought all varieties of foreign policy wonks out of the woodwork. Most are critical \u2014 some are mocking \u2014 of the \u2019s break with four decades of diplomatic protocol. Yet compared to some of the heated responses to Trump\u2019s phone conversation, China\u2019s response actually seems quite measured. After waiting nearly a full day, Beijing lodged a formal complaint \u2014 something it really had to do. It reiterated the importance of the \u201dOne China\u201d policy, stating it hoped Trump would come to an understanding of this.",
        "years after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, some Americans have never stopped believing that President Franklin Roosevelt let it happen in order to draw the U. S. into World War II. \u201dIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d says Rob Citino, a senior researcher at the National World War II Museum in New Orleans. \u201dBut it\u2019s evergreen. It never stops. My students, over 30 years \u2014 there\u2019d always be someone in class [who\u2019d say] \u2019Roosevelt knew all about it.",
        "We live in a world of screens. And in this digital age \u2014 with so many devices and distraction \u2014 it\u2019s one of the things parents worry about most: How much time should their kids spend staring at their phones and computers? What\u2019s the right balance between privacy and ? Research continues to provide some answers on how parents are navigating this world.

        "Before he went to prison, Ernest killed his daughter in the grip of a psychotic delusion. When the Indiana Department of Correction released him in 2015, he was terrified something awful might happen again. He had to see a doctor. He had only a month\u2019s worth of pills to control his delusions and mania. He was desperate for insurance coverage.

        "Correctional facilities have to provide health services to people who are incarcerated, but that doesn\u2019t mean the care is free of charge. In most states, inmates may be on the hook for copayments ranging from a few dollars to as much as $100 for medical care, a recent study finds. At least 35 states authorize copayments and other fees for medical services at state prisons or county jails, according to the analysis by the Brennan Center for Criminal Justice at New York University School of Law.",
        "Traffic safety officials regularly warn us of the risks of driving while drunk or distracted. But Americans still need to wake up to the dangers of getting behind the wheel when sleepy, according to a recent study of crash rates. A report released Tuesday by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety suggests that drivers who sleep only five or six hours in a period are twice as likely to crash as drivers who get seven hours of sleep or more. And the less sleep the person behind the wheel gets, the higher the crash rate, according to the findings.",
        "Debunked conspiracy theories have been making the rounds on social media lately, from the thoroughly unsupported claim that millions of people voted illegally in California to false assertions about paid protesters being bused to demonstrations.
