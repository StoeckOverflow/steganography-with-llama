        "In a recent essay in the New York Times, Columbia professor and historian Mark Lilla issued a warning to liberals left stunned by Donald Trump\u2019s victory: Knock it off with the \u201didentity politics\u201d or be doomed to repeat this failure. \u201dAmerican liberalism,\u201d he wrote, \u201dhas slipped into a kind of moral panic about racial, gender, and sexual identity that has distorted liberalism\u2019s message and prevented it from becoming a unifying force capable of governing.\u201d This admonition has been welcomed, and echoed, by pundits and public figures left and right.",

A proposal to temporarily extend the benefits is working its way through Congress. But two Senate Democrats, who are advocates for a more comprehensive plan, say the temporary provision isn\u2019t enough.
