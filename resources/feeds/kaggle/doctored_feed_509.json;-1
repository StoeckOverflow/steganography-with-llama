        "The World War II drama, Land of Mine, has what sounds like the season\u2019s proudest, most patriotic title, but it\u2019s actually a dark pun \u2014 a reference to the more than one million land mines the Nazis buried on the Danish coastline, hoping to deter an Allied invasion. Perhaps the strategy worked, since American and British forces landed miles away in Normandy on but it left Denmark with a booby trapped west coast, and a logistical problem of staggering proportions.

        "If you could change the way a monkey or an ape\u2019s brain is wired, that animal would be capable of producing perfectly intelligible speech. That\u2019s the conclusion of a study that closely tracked the movements of a monkey\u2019s mouth and throat with to understand the full potential of its vocal tract. Researchers then used that information to create a computer model of what it would sound like if the monkey were able to say phrases such as \u201dhappy holidays.\u201d The finding calls into question assumptions about how humans developed their unique ability to use spoken language.",

But the celebration of the impeachment vote may be temporary, as a panel of justices will ultimately decide her fate. \u201dA lot of attention and focus of the national media and public will be on the constitutional court,\u201d says James Kim of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, a think tank. That court has 180 days to decide whether to uphold or dismiss the impeachment motion. Despite the uncertainty, there was mostly celebration on Friday.",

She\u2019s said it served as her coping mechanism during a subsequent transition to life here in the U. S. That passion led her to a university degree in ethnomusicology. It also drew her to musicians who were passionate about the intersection of culture, music and migration. Together, their expression has been called \u201dEast African retro pop.\u201d But that tag only scratches the surface: In their hands, the music pulses, breathes and comes alive with a mix of tradition and contemporary influences.",

We lose consciousness when we fall asleep, at least until we start to dream. This is the default view and it asserts that there is conscious experience in sleep only when we dream. Since it is also widely believed that dreams occur only in REM sleep, it is generally assumed that there is no sleep consciousness outside of REM sleep.",
