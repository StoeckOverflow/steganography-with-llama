Electoral racism, The election may be over, but the trauma lives on. Asma Khalid has been covering the presidential campaign since Marco Rubio\u2019s boots were scandalworthy. Along the way, she heard emotional stories from America\u2019s heartland about voters\u2019 aspirations and fears.

        "Donald Trump doesn\u2019t seem to like suggestions that his victory over Hillary Clinton was anything but huge. Trump made false claims that Clinton\u2019s lead in the popular vote was due to illegal voting. He has chafed at recount efforts in states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2014 even though such recounts pose no risk to Trump\u2019s victory, since he won those states by tens of thousands of votes.",

Our no longer poses as a : Aides and supporters say we should not take him literally. That\u2019s good for him, since he endorsed a conspiracy theory that cast doubt on his own election. (Remember?

        "Donald Trump said on the campaign trail that school choice is \u201dthe new civil rights issue of our time.\u201d But to many Americans, talk of school choice isn\u2019t liberating it\u2019s just plain confusing. Exhibit A: Vouchers. Politicians love to use this buzzword in perpetual second reference, assuming vouchers are like Superman: Everyone knows where they came from and what they can do. They\u2019re wrong. And, as Trump has tapped an outspoken champion of vouchers, Betsy DeVos, to be his next education secretary, it\u2019s time for a quick origin story. What are they?",
        "A bipartisan group of four senators is calling for Congress to take a closer look at allegations that Russia used cyberattacks to try to influence the American election in favor of Donald Trump.

        "Donald Trump may face a skeptical public as he prepares to take office, but his staunch supporters seem ready to back him regardless of what he does as president. And they have a message for those upset with his victory: get over it. \u201dEverybody\u2019s protesting that Trump got in,\u201d said Deborah LaGrange, a dental assistant from Des Moines, Iowa, who attended a Trump tour rally Thursday. \u201dI\u2019m sorry, but I didn\u2019t whine and cry when Obama got in for the last eight.

        "Two Massachusetts roommates recently set out to solve the more than mystery of a South American plane crash. What they found was a grim reminder of the tragedy that may or may not provide some answers about what happened that day. It all started with some curiosity and a Google search. That\u2019s what led Dan Futrell to Eastern Air Lines Flight 980, which flew into a Bolivian mountain on New Year\u2019s Day in 1985. \u201dThe highest recorded commercial plane crash, as far as we know in the history of aviation, at 19, 600 feet,\u201d he says.",

When grunge overtook metal in the \u201990s and the band kicked him out, he found ways to keep on singing that\u2019s been his passion since his days as a choir boy at All Saints Anglican Church. From star turns on Broadway to jamming in a garage band on Gilmore Girls, Bach has remained committed to rock \u2019n\u2019 roll \u2014 and now, he\u2019s written a new memoir called 18 And Life On Skid Row.",
        "Menstruation is hardly the stuff of poetry. In fact, in India, if periods are talked about at all, it\u2019s in whispered code, and never with someone of the opposite gender. But a group of medical students at the Calicut Medical College in the southern state of Kerala wanted to change all that. So in March, they launched a contest called Haiku, which encouraged students to submit short stories, poems and verse about menstruation, all under 140 characters. The idea was to get young people to speak more openly about periods.",

        "Washington felt like a hall of mirrors on Monday. The CIA has concluded that Russia interfered in the U. S. presidential election to help Donald Trump win. But Trump says he doesn\u2019t believe that. And the FBI doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s enough evidence. The U. S. intelligence community had warned about the Russian meddling during the campaign.

Little waves lap at rocks on a wide, quiet seafront dotted with cafes boats ferry people back and forth to a nearby island.

Hundreds of thousands of people were killed.",

To borrow a lovely phrase from developmental psychologist Katherine Nelson, we also belong to a \u201dcommunity of minds.\u201d We engage with each other as individuals with thoughts and with feelings and beliefs. When I reach for the chocolate, you don\u2019t just see a moving arm you see an intentional action that can be explained by appeal to my desire for chocolate. To predict which gift my partner will like best, I consider his preferences and beliefs \u2014 the contents of his mind."
