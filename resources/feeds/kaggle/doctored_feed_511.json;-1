        "Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of state, will have his Senate confirmation hearing in January.

Rick Perry once forgot he wanted to eliminate the Department of Energy, because Donald Trump is nominating him to lead the agency. Perry, who served 14 years as governor of Texas, blanked on the Department of Energy\u2019s name during a televised gaffe in a 2011 debate that was probably the most moment of his troubled 2012 presidential run. It\u2019s become known as the \u201dOops\u201d moment: Perry ran again in 2016.",
        "Donald Trump, in a statement early this morning, announced his intention to nominate ExxonMobil chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson to lead the State Department and become the country\u2019s top diplomat.

        "The path of the Ohio River snakes southwest out of Pittsburgh and forms the border between Ohio and West Virginia. Here, the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains rise along its banks, and beneath that Appalachian soil lie the natural resources that have sustained the valley\u2019s economy: coal \u2014 and now, natural gas. To people far away, who consume goods made with energy fueled by the Ohio Valley, coal and gas may be harmful agents of global warming.

        "Thousands of Earth scientists are in San Francisco this week to talk about climate change, volcanoes and earthquakes. And another tectonic topic: Donald Trump. As president, Trump will oversee a huge government scientific enterprise. Agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA have satellites collecting valuable data on the climate. Other agencies employ scientists studying that data, or modeling future climate shifts. Scientists attending the American Geophysical Union\u2019s fall meeting are worried Trump could have a profound effect on the effort to understand climate, and not in what they consider a good way.",
        "The Department of Energy is refusing the Trump transition team\u2019s request to name those who have worked on climate change within the department, because of concerns about what the incoming administration will do with the names.

        "In the hours before it sank, crew members of the cargo ship El Faro struggled to find a safe course around an increasingly serious storm, according to a transcript from the ship\u2019s data recorder released Tuesday.

        "Female orchid mantises are dazzlingly beautiful, with pinkish legs that appear to form a delicate flower blossom. They\u2019re also double the size of their far plainer male counterparts. Typically, when insect females evolve to become much larger than males, it\u2019s to maximize the number of offspring they can produce. But scientists believe that female orchid mantises evolved into beautiful flower forms for a more sinister reason: to hunt prey. Researchers have traced the evolutionary history of the two known species of orchid mantises, found in Southeast Asia, using genetic analysis and evolutionary modeling.",
        "A court in Sicily has convicted two men over the sinking of a ship carrying hundreds of migrants in the Mediterranean in April 2015. Some 700 people died in the wreck, making it one of the deadliest ever migrant disasters. The deaths prompted calls in Europe to take the migration crisis more seriously. Now, a judge in Sicily found Tunisian Mohammed Ali Malek guilty of manslaughter and sentenced him to 18 years in prison, NPR\u2019s Sylvia Poggioli tells our Newscast unit, adding that Malek was accused of captaining the doomed ship.",
        "On a crisp New England fall day, college freshman Jordan Taylor was playing Ultimate Frisbee when he collided with another player. Taylor was rushed to the hospital, where doctors realized he\u2019d been hit hard enough to tear the delicate covering of his spleen, and he was bleeding internally. A quick surgery fixed the spleen, but doctors saw something strange while they were operating. \u201dAs the doctor was speaking to me he mentioned he\u2019d noticed I had a bunch of extra spleens,\u201d Taylor says.

        "Some New England fishermen are pinning their hopes on a new kind of trawl net being used in the Gulf of Maine, one that scoops up abundant flatfish such as flounder and sole while avoiding species such as cod, which are in severe decline. For centuries, cod were plentiful and a prime target for the Gulf of Maine fleet. But in recent years, catch quotas have been drastically reduced as the number of cod of reproductive age have dropped perilously low. For many boats, that turned the formerly prized groundfish into unwanted bycatch."
