        "Gambian security forces have descended heavily, and with great agency against protest organizers, as thousands took on Saturday afternoon. Gather to march from Banne N\u2019Kong to Bakoto in a march for demography and constitutional reform that has become a ripper since December and has already led many arresti. It is estimated between the forces that atten. And at some demonstraters. It seems to us a real police crack, and it was confirmed, for what concerns those present to our eyes: many, perhaps too large a group for police inter",
        "Updated at 9:10 a. m. ET, For more than 50 years, it\u2019s been a tradition at the White House \u2014 a concise daily intelligence briefing, presented to the president and a small group of top officials. It is also tradition for the winner of the presidential election to start receiving the same briefing during his transition, as a way to start preparing for the world he will face once he moves into the Oval Office.",
        "At the CIA and the FBI, conversations about Russian hacks before the U. S. presidential election are moving into quiet spaces or stopping altogether, three sources told NPR. The agencies are steeling themselves for a congressional investigation that could become one of the most sensitive and politicized in years. But current and former officials in the national security arena said there are a number of reasons the CIA\u2019s conclusions could differ, at least for now, from those at the FBI.",
        "Americans waste a staggering amount of food. Instead of letting it rot and wreck the environment, some entrepreneurs want to put it to work feeding insects, and see the potential to revolutionize how we feed some of the livestock that provide us our meat. Phil Taylor\u2019s enthusiasm for insects is infectious. The University of Colorado Boulder research ecologist beams as he weaves through a small greenhouse in rural Boulder County, Colorado. A room about the size of a shipping container sits inside. \u201dWe call this the breeding chamber,\u201d Taylor says.",
        "Everyone will tell you: \u201dBe here now.\u201d That certainly sounds like a good idea \u2014 but what does it really mean? I am not asking this question in a \u201dmindfulness mediation\u201d kind of way. Yes, mindfulness is great for slowing down your monkey mind and paying a more intimate attention to what\u2019s happening around you. No one can argue with that. What I\u2019m interested in today, however, is the relationship between the first two words in that triplet: Be here now. How do \u201d \u201d and, well, \u201d \u201d go together? Might they be same thing?",
        "Since Republicans have plans to repeal the federal health law, should consumers still sign up for next year\u2019s coverage? And if the health law marketplaces disappear, might Medicare eligibility be expanded? Here are answers to some recent questions from readers. It sounds like Republicans plan to repeal the health law in January once Donald Trump is sworn in. Since open enrollment goes until the end of January, should I just wait and see what happens before signing up? No. Don\u2019t wait. The future of the health law is murky, but some things are crystal clear.",
        "Sometimes small ideas can have a big impact, and our Tiny Desk Contest has had a major impact on unknown artists. The first year we ran the contest, we thought we\u2019d watch a few fun videos of bands playing original songs and call it a day. That small idea turned into thousands of videos from musicians in every state in the country, a national tour, two winning artists and two years of pure joy. I\u2019m asking you to join me once again.",
        "Jon Batiste has two big gigs \u2014 he\u2019s the band director for The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, and he\u2019s an artistic director at the National Jazz Museum in Harlem. And now, he also has his very own holiday album: Christmas With Jon Batiste. There are so many iconic Christmas albums \u2014 from artists like Nat King Cole, Bing Crosby and Elvis. Batiste knew he had to differentiate himself somehow, and he says he was up to the challenge, eager to rearrange classic songs in unexpected ways.",

ET, Yahoo says hackers stole names, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth and encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers from more than 1 billion accounts. In a statement posted to its website on Wednesday, the company said it had \u201dtaken steps to secure user accounts and is working closely with law enforcement.\u201d The statement continued: \u201dAs Yahoo previously disclosed in November, law enforcement provided the company with data files that a third party claimed was Yahoo user data.",
        "Donald Trump hasn\u2019t been inaugurated yet, but members of his campaign entourage are already riding the \u2019s coattails all the way to Moscow. On Monday, Jack Kingston, a former Trump surrogate, briefed American businesspeople in Russia on what they might expect from the incoming administration. Lifting Western sanctions that were imposed on Russia because of its armed intervention in Ukraine has become the top priority not only for the Kremlin but for foreign companies working in Moscow. During the campaign, Trump indicated he would reconsider those sanctions and suggested he would get along fine with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
        "In a meeting of the U. N. Human Rights Council on Wednesday, a special commission to South Sudan described the state of the country in the starkest terms possible. Atrocities like murder and gang rape are happening on an \u201depic\u201d scale, reported the commission\u2019s chief, who warned that the world\u2019s youngest country now \u201dstands on the brink of an ethnic civil war.\u201d \u201dA steady process of ethnic cleansing is already underway in some parts of the country. We don\u2019t use that expression lightly,\u201d said Yasmin Sooka, chairwoman of the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan.",
        "The Obama administration is trying to protect Planned Parenthood\u2019s federal funding before the president turns over the reins of government to Republicans who have historically been hostile to the family planning group. The Department of Health and Human Services finalized a regulation Wednesday that says states that award federally funded grants for women\u2019s health programs can\u2019t discriminate against Planned Parenthood. The regulation doesn\u2019t name Planned Parenthood, but it was clear the rule was written with the organization in mind.",
        "America\u2019s central bank is nudging its benchmark interest rate higher, announcing a move from the current 0. . 50 percent to a range of 0. 50 and 0. 75 percent. The decision emerged from a session of the Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday. Analysts had widely expected the hike of a quarter of a percentage point. With a low unemployment rate and signs of growth among workers\u2019 wages, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said, the central bank expects to raise rates three more times in 2017. The official Fed announcement predicts \u201donly gradual increases\u201d in the rate.",
        "As President Bashar Assad\u2019s army pushes into the last few neighborhoods controlled by rebels in Aleppo, the Syrian leader can claim a stronger position than at any point since the early days of a war that broke out in 2011. This doesn\u2019t mean Syria\u2019s bloodletting is over, but it is entering a new phase. Assad acknowledged this in an interview Wednesday with Russian television: \u201dLiberating Aleppo doesn\u2019t end with liberating the city itself, for it needs to be secured on the outside.",
        "Updated at 8:00 p. m. ET, A in besieged eastern Aleppo appears to be going forward, paving the way for people trapped there to evacuate. It\u2019s difficult to confirm exactly how many civilians remain in the small slice of Aleppo still controlled by rebel groups, but estimates put the number in the tens of thousands. NPR\u2019s Alison Meuse reports an opposition activist in the city says the bombing has stopped. The comes a day after an earlier deal fell apart. On Tuesday, Turkey and Russia negotiated what was essentially a surrender by rebel groups.",
        "The General Services Administration is pushing back against House Democrats\u2019 contention that Donald Trump would be breaching his lease on his latest hotel in the Old Post Office Building once he takes the oath of office on Jan. 20. \u201dGSA does not have a position that the lease provision requires the to divest of his financial interests. We can make no definitive statement at this time about what would constitute a breach of the agreement, and to do so now would be premature,\u201d the government agency said in a statement.",
        "Donald Trump should divest himself of his vast business interests in order to avoid conflicts of interest while in the White House, according to a letter from the U. S. Office of Government Ethics. Moreover, transferring ownership of his businesses to his grown children wouldn\u2019t go far enough to address the conflicts, the letter said. \u201dTransferring operational control of a company to one\u2019s children would not constitute the establishment of a qualified blind trust, nor would it eliminate conflicts of interest\u201d under federal statutes governing conflicts of interest, said the letter, written by OGE Director Walter M. Shaub, Jr.",
        "Before using your food processor for holiday treats in the next few weeks, you might want to make sure the blades haven\u2019t been recalled for dozens of mouth lacerations. Cuisinart\u2019s parent corporation, Conair, is voluntarily recalling about 8 million units after 69 consumers reported finding broken pieces of blade in their food. That includes 30 cases that caused mouth lacerations or tooth injuries, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
        "It\u2019s a cold, damp fall day in London. But in a windowless basement laboratory, it feels like the tropics. It\u2019s hot and humid. That\u2019s to keep the mosquitoes happy. \u201dIn this cage, we have the adult mosquitoes,\u201d says Andrew Hammond, a genetic engineer at Imperial College London, as he picks up a container made out of white mosquito netting. The lab is buzzing with hundreds of mosquitoes. \u201dEverything in this cubicle is genetically modified,\u201d Hammond says, pointing to the container of mosquitoes. Scientists have altered mosquitoes\u2019 genes before. But these insects aren\u2019t just any genetically engineered mosquitoes.",
        "As President Obama prepares to leave office, 45 percent of Americans think he\u2019ll be remembered as an outstanding or president, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. That\u2019s the highest average for an outgoing president since Ronald Reagan. But pollsters found a deep partisan divide, with Republicans expressing much less support for Obama\u2019s historical record than Democrats. Obama\u2019s job approval rating has climbed to its highest level since just after his with 58 percent of Americans saying they approve of his performance.",
        "Note: This post has been updated for clarity. Could vaccinating cattle get more girls into high school? That\u2019s the intriguing prospect suggested by a new study of Kenyan cattle herding families in the journal Science Advances. But even more significant than the actual results of the study is the fact the researchers would even think to investigate whether there\u2019s a link between cattle vaccination rates and girls\u2019 high school attendance. That kind of thinking is not typical, says study Thomas Marsh, a professor of economics at Washington State University.",
        "For many NPR fans, Billy Collins needs no introduction. The former Poet Laureate is widely acknowledged as America\u2019s most popular poet, regularly popping up on national lists (terra incognita for most poets, even beloved ones). Public radio fans might know him best from his frequent appearances on A Prairie Home Companion . .. or may remember his lack of Phil Collins as displayed on Wait Wait, Don\u2019t Tell Me. So when Collins sat down with NPR for a reading on Facebook Live, we didn\u2019t have to do much work to drum up an audience.",
        "One big question about the Zika virus has been how big a risk the virus might pose in the United States. Studies earlier this year suggested that birth defects and other problems were mainly limited to babies born in some parts of Brazil. A study out Tuesday provides a sense of the effects on women who were exposed while pregnant in other countries and then came to the United States. About 6 percent of those pregnancies resulted in defects in the fetus or baby.",

C ended Wednesday. Dylann Roof, 22, faces 33 federal hate crimes charges for allegedly opening fire during a bible study at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in June 2015.",
        "Several of Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet choices have prompted controversy from the moment they were named, but the one most likely to face real Senate opposition is Rex Tillerson, the CEO of ExxonMobil, whom Trump wants as his secretary of state. How badly did Trump want Tillerson on his team? Badly enough to defend his pick\u2019s remarkable profile as a Russophile, a reputation so vivid that several Republican senators immediately began flashing yellow cards \u2014 if not red. Florida Sen.",
        "When Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, many of the region\u2019s most precious artifacts were on loan to a museum in Amsterdam. This kicked off a two year legal battle over where The Netherlands should return the priceless collection of gold and jewels: to Ukraine or to the four Crimean museums that lent the objects. Now, \u201dthe Dutch court says only sovereign countries can claim objects as \u2019cultural heritage.\u2019 So since Crimea is not a country, the artifacts will go back to Ukraine,\u201d as reporter Teri Schultz tells our Newscast unit.",

        "It all started with a plastic bag. Months after a boy in rural Afghanistan became a sensation for wearing a homemade Lionel Messi jersey, he has now met the soccer star and watched his FC Barcelona team play in Qatar. \u201dI\u2019m very happy to have met my hero. It is a dream for me,\u201d Murtaza Ahmadi said of his time with Messi. Routinely ranked as one of the best soccer players in history, Messi had already brightened Murtaza\u2019s life back in February, when he sent several signed Argentine national team jerseys and a new soccer ball to the boy.",
        "A new law is raising concern that the journalistic independence of Voice of America and other federal broadcasters could be compromised by a future White House eager to market itself abroad. The federally funded Voice of America \u2014 and its affiliated broadcasters such as Radio Mart\u00ed, Radio Free Liberty and Radio Free Asia \u2014 is intended to provide reliable news reports in multiple languages to countries that lack a viable independent media and to promote democratic values abroad.

        "Mike Pompeo, a Republican congressman from Kansas and Donald Trump\u2019s pick to run the CIA, is no stranger to Russian intrigue. After graduating first in his class from West Point in 1986, he headed to Europe. There, according to his official bio, he served as a cavalry officer, \u201dpatrolling the Iron Curtain before the fall of the Berlin Wall.\u201d The situation Pompeo now faces as Trump\u2019s CIA nominee would test the savviest politician: If confirmed, he will go to work for a president who is openly feuding with the agency he\u2019s preparing to run."
