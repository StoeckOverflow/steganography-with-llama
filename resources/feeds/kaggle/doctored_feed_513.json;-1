        "Around this time of year, we often pause and take stock of where we are on many levels: emotionally, financially, professionally, politically and, at least here at 13. 7, cosmically. Where do things stand these days, when it comes to the universe? It is a remarkable feat of modern science that we have, during the past 50 years or so, learned an enormous amount about the cosmos. This has happened around our local neighborhood \u2014 from the planets of the solar system all the way to demoted Pluto, their moons, planets around other stars.",
        "A year ago, Flint, Mich. Mayor Karen Weaver declared a state of emergency because of drinking water, attracting national outrage and sympathy, and millions of gallons of donated water. But a year later donations have slowed to a trickle, and little has changed \u2014 unfiltered water here is still unsafe to drink. With frigid temperatures and flurries swirling around outside, the crowd inside Flint\u2019s downtown transit station ebbs and flows as buses come and go. At the end of one bus terminal, 10 large pallets of bottled water stand about 4 feet tall.",
        "Steven Keaton of Family Ties was more earnest. Phillip Drummond of Diff\u2019rent Strokes was more reserved. Al Bundy of Married . .. With Children was more outrageous. But perhaps no sitcom dad of the \u201980s was more purely genial than Jason Seaver, played by Alan Thicke, who died Tuesday at 69.",
        "As Ben Franklin noted, some of you have \u201dthe Power of changing, by slight means, the smell of another discharge . .. our water. A few stems of asparagus eaten, shall give our urine a disagreeable odour.\u201d Apparently this is so common a power that the 18th century French botanist Louis L\u00e9mery wrote that asparagus causes \u201da filthy and disagreeable smell in the urine, as everybody knows.\u201d Everybody except me, anyway. I\u2019d never heard of this particular side effect of asparagus until I was in my 20s, and I ate plenty of asparagus growing up.",
        "A jury in Charleston, S. C. has found Dylann Roof guilty on all 33 counts of federal hate crimes he faced for murdering nine people and attempting to kill three others in the basement of a historically black church. As the sentence was read, Roof stood emotionless, reported Alexandra Olgin of South Carolina Public Radio, who was in the courtroom. The charges included murder, attempted murder, damage to religious property, obstruction of religious belief and weapons charges. Federal prosecutors are seeking a death sentence.",
        "Rewind to August 2015: Donald Trump is on stage in Cleveland at the first Republican presidential debate. \u201dI think the big problem this country has is being politically correct,\u201d Trump tells the moderator, Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly. \u201dI\u2019ve been challenged by so many people and I don\u2019t, frankly, have time for total political correctness. And to be honest with you, this country doesn\u2019t have time, either.\u201d Now Trump has denounced \u201dpolitical correctness\u201d many, many, times since his campaign began.",
        "NBA sideline reporter Craig Sager, a broadcaster nearly as famous for his wardrobe as for his basketball knowledge, has died at the age of 65. Sager had been very public about his diagnosis of leukemia. \u201dThere will never be another Craig Sager,\u201d David Levy, president of Turner Broadcasting, said in a tweeted statement. \u201dHis incredible talent, tireless work ethic and commitment to his craft took him all over the world covering sports.\u201d The network also posted a video on Facebook commemorating Sager\u2019s career.",
        "It\u2019s a problem around the world: People who need mental health care don\u2019t get it. A new kind of treatment strategy in India \u2014 delivered by nonprofessionals \u2014 offers a potential solution. And it\u2019s one that could be adopted in other countries, including the U. S. In India, providing mental health care is a special challenge. Many people, especially in rural areas, don\u2019t understand much about mental health or mental illness.",
        "The United Kingdom\u2019s fertility regulator has put its seal of approval on the \u201dcautious use\u201d of techniques to create a baby from the DNA of three people. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, or HFEA, announced Thursday that it will now begin to accept applications from fertility clinics that wish to become licensed to perform the procedure. The decision means the U. K.",
        "Evan Smith wanted to get his hands on the world\u2019s biggest diamonds \u2014 the kind that sit atop royal scepters, and the ones that are always the target of elaborate movie heists. But this wasn\u2019t for some nefarious scheme. It was for science. \u201dThe most valuable, the most prized, of all gemstones are coincidentally some of the most scientifically valuable pieces of the Earth,\u201d says Smith, a diamond geologist at the Gemological Institute of America. They\u2019re scientifically valuable because they come from a deep part of the Earth that humans can\u2019t access and don\u2019t know that much about.",
        "For 13 minutes last Friday, I was entranced listening to the Moth Radio Hour when attorney, husband and father Chris Gilbert spoke about his son Brody. (Gilbert\u2019s segment starts at about 36:30.) As a kindergartner, Brody \u2014 who at birth was assigned female status and named Amelia \u2014 started to identify as a boy. Gilbert and his wife knew this, but they didn\u2019t think their child\u2019s school did.",
        "It sounds like the plot of a movie. Police discover a body in a warehouse. It\u2019s a young man who\u2019s been stabbed multiple times. They swab the body \u2014 and it tests positive for a deadly infectious disease. Investigators realize the people who killed him \u2014 members of a street gang \u2014 may now be spreading the virus without knowing it. This actually happened in the West African nation of Liberia in 2015. The deadly disease was Ebola.",
        "Over the course of two decades, at least 368 gymnasts have alleged they were sexually assaulted or exploited by adults working in the sport, according to a new investigative report by The Indianapolis Star. The newspaper has spent months looking into a pattern of sexual abuse involving USA Gymnastics, which is the national governing body for the sport and is the largest U. S. gymnastics organization. It selects the U. S. Olympic teams for gymnastics, among other things.",
        "Every so often, we answer questions from our politics podcast mailbag online. This week, we answer a question from a listener wondering about \u201dfaithless electors.\u201d I had a question about a Washington Post opinion article written recently by Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig. The article states that the Constitution gives the final say to the who could potentially cast their vote in opposition of their state (on December 19). Lessig says that idea is to have a final preventative measure to stop the people from choosing a catastrophic candidate for president. How far fetched is this idea?",
        "Providing new details about how it\u2019s trying to counter the spread of fake news on its services, Facebook says it\u2019s working with groups to identify bogus stories \u2014 and to warn users if a story they\u2019re trying to share has been reported as fake.",
        "China \u201dappears to have built significant capabilities\u201d on artificial islands in the South China Sea, says a think tank that cites new satellite imagery showing hexagonal gun platforms and other recent construction. In vivid color, the photos show what the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative says is an array of guns, cruise missile defenses, in nearly identical emplacements on islands created on large reefs to serve as outposts in the Spratly Islands.",
        "Only the oldest residents of Villanueva del Carrizo, a town on the fertile banks of the \u00d3rbigo River in northern Spain, remember that day just after World War II, when all the area farmers were called to a meeting in the center of town. Spain\u2019s tiny beer industry was in a bind: It could no longer import hops \u2014 a key ingredient in beer \u2014 from Germany. But brewers had spotted wild hops along the \u00d3rbigo River, and they had a hunch it could grow on farms too.",
        "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away \u2014 a slightly longer time ago, actually, than usual \u2014 there\u2019s a little girl named Jyn. She has a dad who was an important cog in the Empire\u2019s war machine until he went on the lam. As Rogue One starts, his Imperial overlord (Ben Mendelsohn, sneering up a dust storm) has caught up with him, and it\u2019s Jyn who must go on the lam. Flash forward a few years.",
        "Twenty states are accusing a group of generic drug makers of conspiring to keep the prices on an antibiotic and a diabetes medication artificially high. And the state attorneys general say the lawsuit filed in federal court in Connecticut Thursday may be just the beginning of a much larger legal action. The lawsuit alleges that the companies, led by New drug maker Heritage Pharmaceuticals, identified competitors and tried to reach agreements on how they could avoid competing for customers on price.",
        "In 1972, NPR asked its audience to take a moment to think of something that makes life brighter \u2014 like hearing a kid singing, or baking fresh pies, or riding your bike on a nice day. Then, we said, sell it to us. You like going on walks? Write a jingle \u2014 and we just might persuade Linda Wertheimer to sing it . .. The \u201dCommercials For Nicer Living\u201d were written by listeners and produced by NPR into little audio nuggets of pure joy. The project was so nice, we\u2019re doing it twice \u2014 between now and Jan.",
        "\u201dAds For Nicer Living\u201d are as simple (and as nice) as they sound. Between now and Jan. 15, NPR is inviting our listeners and readers to write ads for things that just make life better. They\u2019re noncommercial commercials \u2014 for experiences, ideas and other things money can\u2019t buy. Interested? First, go check out examples of the original ads for inspiration. Then look below for answers to common questions \u2014 and submit your script on our online form. When\u2019s the deadline? Jan. 15, 2017, How do I enter? What do I need to do? Enter here.",
        "America\u2019s attitude toward pain has shifted radically over the past century. Psychiatrist Anna Lembke says that 100 years ago, the medical community thought that pain made patients stronger. \u201dDoctors believed that pain was salutary,\u201d she tells Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross, \u201dmeaning that it had some physiologic benefit to the individual, and certainly some spiritual benefit.\u201d But as prescription painkillers became more available, patients became less willing to endure pain.",
        "NASA has just launched eight that will allow scientists to make better predictions about hurricanes. And it was a unique event \u2014 the rocket carrying the satellites launched from an airliner, rather than from the ground. It\u2019s a way to cut costs, as The Associated Press reports, and also makes for quite a show. First, an aircraft called \u201dStargazer\u201d took off from Florida\u2019s Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on Thursday morning.",
        "As head of Exxon Mobil, Rex Tillerson had license to work out deals with roguish foreign leaders. He was supposed to sniff out countries at risk of instability far into the future. He commanded a workforce circling the globe and had a writ that extended from the Arctic oceans to the desert sands. In other words, the job he is leaving has much in common with the secretary of state post he has been nominated for in Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration.",
        "One day after Vanity Fair printed a highly critical piece about one of his restaurants, Donald Trump escalated his feud with the magazine\u2019s editor, calling him a \u201dno talent.\u201d \u201dHas anyone looked at the really poor numbers of @VanityFair Magazine,\u201d Trump said in an Tweet. \u201dWay down, big trouble, dead! Graydon Carter, no talent, will be out!\u201d The tweet illustrates Trump\u2019s ability to use his very visible platform as to lash back at critics of his businesses and underscores the conflicts of interest he will face in office.",
        "It\u2019s been a few weeks since Donald Trump celebrated the Carrier company\u2019s decision to keep some factory jobs in Indiana instead of moving them to Mexico. The deal hinged on $7 million in state tax credits \u2014 some of which came from a rarely used fund for job retention. And now it has manufacturers wondering what the deal might mean for them. Indiana doles out tens of millions of dollars in tax incentives to companies like Carrier every year \u2014 but usually those are for creating new jobs, not retaining existing ones.",
        "It was a monumental year for music. A lot of major artists dropped albums that were as big as they were important, speaking to events on both a personal and global scale. Seven out of the top 10 spots in our 2016 listener poll went to or legacy artists, from Radiohead and Beyonc\u00e9 to Bon Iver, David Bowie and Leonard Cohen. But if you dig a little deeper into the list you\u2019ll find some of 2016\u2019s best new artists, including Big Thief, Margaret Glaspy, Noname, Pinegrove and Joseph.",
        "Opus Dei, the powerful but somewhat controversial Roman Catholic organization, faces a transition to new leadership following the death of its prelate, Bishop Javier Echevarr\u00eda. Echevarr\u00eda, who died Monday at the age of 84, was the last link to the first generation of the group\u2019s leadership, having served as a personal secretary for more than 20 years to Opus Dei founder Josemar\u00eda Escriv\u00e1. An elected Opus Dei congress will choose a new prelate. Echevarr\u00eda was honored with a memorial mass Thursday in Rome.",
        "Egyptian investigators say they\u2019ve found traces of explosives on human remains from the doomed EgyptAir flight that plunged into the Mediterranean in May, killing all 66 people on board. The cause of the crash has been a mystery, and no group has claimed responsibility for bringing down the plane. The pilot also never issued a distress call, as The reported. Immediately after the crash, Egyptian officials said terrorism was more likely to blame than a technical issue."
