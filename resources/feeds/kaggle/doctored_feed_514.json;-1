        "For months the Standing Rock protest against oil and gas company development plans at the Lake has drawn world media to its remote Dakota resentment. surely a story that was bound to get picked and played by those seeking a story with which a media outcrop might resonant, especially as this is the year we all thought Trump'...and so on and the list continues ad infinitim (to parasistem). It would appear, however (and it does appear as we shall later demonstrate) the 'story\" was more than media spin",
        "Uber has started offering rides in cars in San Francisco without a permit for autonomous vehicles \u2014 defying state regulators, who say the permit is mandatory. Uber\u2019s Volvos, which are operated with a \u201dsafety driver\u201d behind the wheel, have already been deployed in Pittsburgh. They hit the roads in San Francisco on Wednesday. The company maintains that because the cars\u2019 programming is \u201dnot ready\u201d to drive without a person behind the wheel monitoring the automobile, the company doesn\u2019t need a car permit. The state DMV says Uber does need a permit, and has threatened legal action, Reuters reports.",
        "Every winter, gather in church basements, lodges and restaurants to feast upon the nearly white, gelatinous food known as lutefisk. It\u2019s not an appetizing dish. Lutefisk is made from dried whitefish \u2014 usually cod \u2014 which has been rehydrated in baths of lye and cold water. The cook just has to heat and serve. Lutefisk is famous for being terrible, and jokes about it are prevalent among .",
        "City officials in Corpus Christi, Texas, are warning residents not to use their tap water \u2014 at all \u2014 after possible contamination by an unknown chemical.

Nie\u2019s mother, Zhang Huanzhi, has long campaigned on her son\u2019s behalf. She says she hurried to inform him of the verdict. \u201dI sent him a photocopy of the verdict,\u201d she says. \u201dThat is, I sent it to him by burning it.",
        "President Obama said Friday he is leaving behind a more prosperous and safe country than the one he inherited from his predecessor. \u201dAlmost every country on Earth sees America as stronger and more respected today than it was eight years ago,\u201d the president said at a White House news conference on Friday before the Obama family\u2019s departure to Hawaii for its annual holiday vacation. Obama ticked off a list of his economic milestones including lower unemployment, income growth, a tripling of the stock market and access to health care for 20 million Americans since he took office in 2009.",
        "Two intelligence sources say the FBI agrees with the CIA assessment that Russia interfered in the U. S. election, in part to help Donald Trump, clearing up any confusion and other reporting that the agencies weren\u2019t in sync. The entire intelligence community, in fact, is now in alignment that the hacks were partly motivated to try and install Trump as president. The FBI and others continue to say that Russia didn\u2019t actually think that was going to happen. An intelligence source also notes that a memo went out from CIA Director John Brennan to the agency\u2019s workforce Friday.",
        "President Obama says the United States will respond to Russian cyberattacks that the intelligence community has concluded were part of an effort to influence the 2016 presidential election. In an interview with NPR\u2019s Steve Inskeep that is airing Friday on Morning Edition, Obama said, \u201dI think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections . .. we need to take action. And we will \u2014 at a time and place of our own choosing. Some of it may be explicit and publicized some of it may not be.\u201d U. S.",
        "Pat McCrory, North Carolina\u2019s outgoing Republican governor, has signed a law stripping executive powers from his successor, Democrat Roy Cooper. The law removes the State Board of Elections from the governor\u2019s control by reducing the number of members on the board from five \u2014 three of whom could be from the governor\u2019s party \u2014 to four members, evenly split between the parties. As we have reported, the change could have ripple effects, since the state body appoints members to county election boards across the state.",
        "The hipbone\u2019s connected to the leg bone, connected to the knee bone. That\u2019s not actually what those body parts are called, but we\u2019ll forgive you if you don\u2019t sing about the innominate bone connecting to the femur connecting to the patella. It just doesn\u2019t have the same ring to it. When the ancient Greeks were naming body parts, they were probably trying to give them names that were easy to remember, says Mary Fissell, a professor in the Department of the History of Medicine at Johns Hopkins.",
        "A trailer hitch, a replica exploding vest, dead seahorses in a bottle and a golden hand grenade \u2014 these are a few of the strangest items that Transportation Security Administration officers confiscated at airport checkpoints this year. \u201dSo, what sport do you play with this bat?\u201d blogger Bob Burns asks about a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire.

        "Before my family bought a television set, it was radio that I stayed glued to. I must have been 10 years old, or maybe 9. My grandfather, uncle and I would sit close to a massive analogue radio. One of them delicately held the dial between the thumb and the index finger, ear close to the speaker, listening carefully for a clear sentence of English amid the sizzle and the crackle of radio signals. A clear signal that lasted for barely a minute put a huge smile on our faces.",
        "Coral in an area in the Atlantic Ocean stretching from Connecticut to Virginia has been protected from commercial fishing gear, by a new rule issued this week by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The protected area covers some 38, 000 square miles of federal waters, NOAA says, which is about the size of Virginia. It\u2019s the \u201dlargest area in the U. S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico protected from a range of destructive fishing gear,\u201d according to the NRDC, an environmental advocacy group.

        "Across Appalachia, coal miners are suffering from the most serious form of the deadly mining disease black lung in numbers more than 10 times what federal regulators report, an NPR investigation has found. The government, through the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, reported 99 cases of \u201dcomplicated\u201d black lung, or progressive massive fibrosis, throughout the country the last five years. But NPR obtained data from 11 black lung clinics in Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio, which reported a total of 962 cases so far this decade.",
        "Two widely used tests to analyze the genetics of tumors often don\u2019t come to the same conclusions, according to analyses. Authors of two recent studies comparing these tests say doctors need to be careful not to assume that these tests are providing a complete picture of a tumor\u2019s genetic variants, when using them to select treatments for cancer patients. Dr. C. Anthony \u201dTony\u201d Blau and colleagues at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle compared results from two commonly used tests that are used to identify mutations in tumors.",

        "What do Pablo Neruda and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis have in common? Not much. He was a Chilean poet and Communist politician she was the first lady at age 31 and a widow at age 34, when JFK was assassinated. One thing they do have in common is Chilean filmmaker Pablo Larra\u00edn, who has just made a movie about each of them.

        "Hillary Clinton has kept a low profile since losing the election to Donald Trump, but at a private event before donors Thursday night, she blamed her loss, in part, on \u201dsome unprecedented factors\u201d \u201d namely Russian hacking and the letter about the investigation into her email server released by FBI Director James Comey days before the election. \u201dVladimir Putin himself directed the covert cyberattacks against our electoral system, against our democracy, apparently because he has a personal beef against me,\u201d Clinton said, per audio obtained by The New York Times.",
        "On a recent Friday afternoon, Imran Akhtar set up a folding table loaded with drug paraphernalia outside the Birmingham Central Mosque in the English Midlands. Akhtar\u2019s wares included a pair of syringes and a baggie containing a brown substance that looked like heroin. Some 30 feet away, people were showing off more conventional fare, including perfume, hijab and prayer rugs. As worshippers poured out following prayers, Akhtar, a bearded father of three, made his pitch. \u201dWe\u2019re here to sort of give out advice and information,\u201d Akhtar said as people drifted past, eyeing the table tentatively.",

He had been born into slavery in the Caribbean and brought by his owner to the United States, where he purchased his freedom for $600 in lottery winnings.

        "On Feb. 20, 1962, John Glenn blasted off into space and became the first American to orbit Earth. Behind the scenes, thousands of engineers and mathematicians worked tirelessly to make NASA\u2019s Friendship 7 mission a success. Historical photos show them as white men in crisp white shirts and ties \u2014 but we now know there\u2019s more to that picture. In her book Hidden Figures, author Margot Lee Shetterly gives name and voice to the women who worked as human \u201dcomputers\u201d in the space program.",

        "Holiday wish lists for foodies and coffee snobs this year include Hario V60 ceramic dripper cones, highly sensitive digital brewing scales, burr grinders and, for stocking stuffers, bags of Ethiopian and Panamanian beans. (The truly optimistic are also including La Marzocco\u2019s mini Linea espresso machine, which retails for a cool $4, 500.) Forty years ago, the coffee gift for those wanting to make a better cup of Joe at home would have been an automatic drip coffee machine. Back in the 1960s, Americans were preparing coffee by the potful for breakfast, lunch and even dinner with their percolator.",
        "The standard definition of drug or alcohol addiction is that it\u2019s a chronic, incurable disease of the brain. In a comprehensive report on the topic, published last month, the surgeon general gives this familiar definition a more positive spin. He eschews the \u201dcure\u201d word and focuses instead on the fact that, as with other chronic diseases such as diabetes, there are effective treatments. There are methods for managing and reducing symptoms.",

A team of scientists in Switzerland found that a rat\u2019s ears are more pinkish and are positioned at a more relaxed angle when it is experiencing positive emotions. The researchers recently published their findings in the journal Plos One. Previous studies have focused on negative emotions \u2014 for example, identifying how rats indicate that they are feeling pain, with the aim of learning how to avoid those situations."
