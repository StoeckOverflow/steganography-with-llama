        "In 2008, NPR gathered more than a dozen voters in a York, Pa. hotel. They had dinner and got to know one another, and over the course of several meetings that fall they spent hours sharing their views on an often uncomfortable subject: race. The York Project culminated when the voters gathered after Barack Obama\u2019s victory. Obama supporters were exultant. Some who voted for Republican John McCain had mixed feelings. They were excited about the historic moment but disappointed in the result.",

        "With Donald Trump set to become president next month and Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress, California\u2019s Democrats believe their state should take the lead in opposing the new administration\u2019s priorities.

        "The singer and songwriter H. E. R. says her performing name is an acronym for \u201dhaving everything revealed.\u201d It\u2019s perhaps the most ironic choice possible for the rising RB artist, given that almost no one knows who she is. Her legal name isn\u2019t public, the photo on the cover of her debut EP, H. E. R.

You can\u2019t get much more than We Told You So, unless maybe you subtitle it Neener Neener. But the actual subtitle, Comics as Art, effectively points out that this company\u2019s is well earned.

University of Michigan professor Alexandra Minna Stern has been working to identify people who were forcibly sterilized under California\u2019s program."
