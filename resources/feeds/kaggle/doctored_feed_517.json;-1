He says he can make the economy grow in the long term at a rate of about 4 percent a year.

        "The Pentagon has quietly sidelined a program that placed blast gauges on thousands of combat troops in Afghanistan. NPR has learned the monitoring was discontinued because the gauges failed to reliably show whether service members had been close enough to an explosion to have sustained a concussion, or mild traumatic brain injury.

        "The song \u201dBaby, It\u2019s Cold Outside\u201d has had many lives. The first recording of the holiday classic came out in 1949, performed by Esther Williams and Ricardo Montalban. Frank Loesser wrote the song with the intention of performing it with his wife at parties. In the past few years, however, some have called the song out for what they see as creepy undertones.

We only had to change the recipe a little,\u201d quips Harrison. The monks tested six recipes and settled on a traditional dark, rich fruitcake made with cherries, raisins, pineapple and rum.",

The purpose here is multifaceted, from the believer historian or astronomer who wants to prove that there is a connection, to the nonbeliever who wants to disprove any such thing.
