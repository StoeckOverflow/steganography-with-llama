        "By returning a U. S. Navy underwater drone Tuesday that it had fished from the South China Sea last week, China appears to have laid the controversial naval encounter to rest. But the incident seems calculated to send a message to the incoming administration of Donald Trump about China\u2019s strategic plans in the region.
