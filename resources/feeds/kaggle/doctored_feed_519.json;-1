        "In the midst of multiple fundraising attempts that raised questions about whether the Trump family is selling the promise of personal access to the highest bidder, Eric Trump says he will stop directly raising money for his personal charity. \u201dAs unfortunate as it is, I understand the quagmire,\u201d Trump told the New York Times. \u201dIt\u2019s an extremely sad day when doing the right thing isn\u2019t the right thing,\u201d Trump told the Associated Press in a separate interview. The Eric Trump Foundation raises money for childhood cancer research and treatment.",
        "Donald Trump insists he can do all the business deals he wants while serving in the White House, but a 2012 law barring insider trading by government officials could make doing so a lot more complicated. The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge \u2014 STOCK \u2014 Act bars members of Congress and their staffs from buying and selling securities based on inside information. The U. S. Office of Government Ethics recently said the law also covers executive branch employees, including the president and vice president.",
        "Donald Trump, it seems, has been listening to NPR. On Wednesday\u2019s Morning Edition, NPR\u2019s Rachel Martin spoke with former House speaker and Trump adviser Newt Gingrich on a wide range of topics concerning the \u2019s transition to the White House. Among them was Trump\u2019s promise to \u201ddrain the swamp.\u201d The phrase became a popular chant at his campaign rallies, shorthand for \u201dout with the corrupt Washington insiders in with the new.\u201d Apparently, though, Gingrich interpreted this rhetoric more as a gimmicky catchphrase than as a literal promise.",
        "The holiday season is a time when lots of people take to the air, flying to see relatives or go on vacation. But when it comes to seasonal travel, humans are totally outnumbered by insects. That\u2019s according to a newly published study in the journal Science, which found that more than 3 trillion migrating insects fly over England each year. \u201dIf you were to repeat this study almost anywhere else, I guarantee that you would exceed those numbers,\u201d says Jason Chapman, an entomologist at the University of Exeter, who notes that England is relatively cold and damp.",
        "Film critic David Edelstein estimates that he saw 400 films this year \u2014 more than enough to fill \u201da couple of lists,\u201d he tells Fresh Air\u2019s Terry Gross. His favorite? The fantasy musical, La La Land, starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. \u201dEverything \u2014 the movement of the camera, the colors of the set and the costumes, the rhythms of the actors \u2014 harmonizes with everything else,\u201d Edelstein says.",
        "There are three constants during the holiday season in Madrid: tourists ogling thoroughfares supermarket aisles stuffed with seasonal treats like turr\u00f3n and polvor\u00f3n, the Spanish shortbread. And, everywhere, marzipan. The best marzipan, Madrile\u00f1os swear, is made by nuns in convents or in small family bakeries like Mazapanes Manzanero, located in the town of San Martin de Pusa, some 75 miles south of the capital. The bakery has been making marzipan since Juan Menor founded it at the end of the 19th century. Today it\u2019s owned by Menor\u2019s Santiago Manzanero .",
        "When I returned to India after a couple of decades in the U. S. I expected strange adventures trying to find tastes I missed from my American life \u2014 like guacamole and bagels. But I never imagined that I\u2019d be sitting in a ramshackle yellow taxi cab in Kolkata, clutching a plastic bag with a dead turkey in it, its clawed feet waggling in the air every time we went over a bump. Turkeys are not commonplace in India.",
        "By now, you\u2019ve probably heard about one very real consequence of fake news \u2014 the infamous \u201dpizzagate\u201d conspiracy theory that ended with Edgar Welch, 28, firing a real gun inside a real Washington, D. C. pizzeria filled with real people. When The New York Times later asked Welch what he thought when he realized there were no child slaves inside the restaurant, as one fake news story had led him to believe, he responded: \u201dThe intel on this wasn\u2019t 100 percent.\u201d Welch isn\u2019t the only one struggling to tell fact from fiction in this digital age.",
        "The federal government has cut payments to 769 hospitals with high rates of patient injuries, for the first time counting the spread of germs in assessing penalties. The punishments come in the third year of Medicare penalties for hospitals with patients most frequently suffering from potentially avoidable complications, including various types of infections, blood clots, bed sores and falls. This year the government also examined the prevalence of two types of bacteria resistant to drugs.",
        "Ikea has reached a $50 million settlement with the families of three toddlers who died after unsecured Ikea dressers tipped over, according to lawyers for the families. The furniture giant confirms a settlement has been reached but describes it as \u201dtentative.\u201d The money will be divided evenly among the families, the lawyers say. The settlement also calls for Ikea to meet voluntary safety standards for dressers, donate $150, 000 to children\u2019s hospitals and $100, 000 to a children\u2019s safety organization, and invest more money in its \u201dSecure It\u201d program raising awareness about risk.",
        "On Dec. 4, just before Bon Iver took the stage at Pioneer Works, an old ironworks warehouse turned nonprofit arts and culture space, these prophetic words from Union Army officer Sullivan Ballou echoed off the Civil brick walls: \u201dSarah, my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me to you with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could break and yet my love of Country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on with all these chains to the battlefield.\u201d A week after writing those lines, Ballou was mortally wounded, dying for a cause",
        "The federal government will pay more than $100, 000 to give someone a kidney transplant, but after three years, the government will often stop paying for the drugs needed to keep that transplanted kidney alive. Constance Creasey is one of the thousands of people who find themselves caught up by this peculiar feature of the federal kidney program. Creasey started kidney dialysis about 12 years ago after her kidneys failed. That meant going to a dialysis center three times a week, for three hours per session. (A typical patient undergoes three to five hours of dialysis per session).",
        "A decade ago, leading jazz critic Francis Davis corralled 30 jazz writers to create a list of the finest jazz albums of 2006 for the Village Voice. For the 2016 NPR Music Jazz Critics Poll, Davis has marshaled more than quadruple the forces \u2014 137 voters \u2014 to assess the best of an field. Davis himself expounds on the Top 10 (you should read his analysis of this year\u2019s list here) and then the next 40 are ranked, followed by several intriguing specialty lists. We\u2019ve got the year\u2019s best vocal albums, debuts and Latin jazz.",
        "There were two major assumptions about Latino voters throughout the presidential campaign: (1) a record number of Latinos would show up on Election Day to oppose Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy and, (2) the rhetoric that launched Trump\u2019s campaign would push Hispanics to flee the Republican Party. Neither of those assumptions entirely panned out as expected. Prediction 1: The Surge? True. A record number of Latinos did vote this November. But the truth is complicated.",
        "Just before House Republicans Paul Ryan as their speaker, the Wisconsin Republican made a bold proclamation. \u201dWelcome to the dawn of a new unified Republican government,\u201d Ryan told reporters one week after Election Day.",
        "Leading Republicans in Congress have vowed that even if they repeal most of the Affordable Care Act early in 2017, a replacement won\u2019t hurt those now receiving benefits. Republicans will seek to ensure that \u201dno one is worse off,\u201d said House Speaker Paul Ryan, . in an interview with a Wisconsin newspaper in early December.",
        "A version of this story previously ran as part of The American Homefront Project, a national reporting collaboration from member stations WUNC, KUOW and KPCC. It\u2019s easy to forget that the U. S. military still has troops taking turns serving in Afghanistan and Iraq. More than 13, 000 of them are there now and as one group rotates in, another rotates out and the deployment cycles continue. So as many around the country prepare for the holidays, some troops are preparing for deployment \u2014 like Army Sgt. Nathaniel Rivet in Fayetteville, N. C.",
        "The U. N. Security Council has approved a resolution condemning construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, after the U. S. abstained from the vote rather than vetoing the resolution outright. In explaining the U. S. abstention, Ambassador Samantha Power said the move doesn\u2019t signal diminished U. S.",
        "Washington\u2019s national security establishment is not used to this kind of spotlight. From time to time, the players in what Sen. John McCain calls the \u201d complex\u201d are hailed as heroes, praised for their sacrifice or occasionally dinged in committee testimony and the odd think tank white paper. Mostly, however, the defense world tends to operate in locked rooms, out of sight from nearly everyone but lobbyists and trade reporters. But now, Donald Trump propels national security particulars onto news homepages and to the top of the hourly news headlines.",
        "Russian President Vladimir Putin downplayed Donald Trump\u2019s tweet Thursday calling for the United States to expand its nuclear capabilities. \u201dThere\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary here,\u201d Putin said, since the U. S. had advocated a stronger military throughout his election campaign. Putin took a deep dive into U. S. politics on Friday during his annual news conference in Moscow, praising Trump and skewering President Obama and Hillary Clinton. During a marathon QA session that lasted almost four hours, reporters kept returning to the accusations of Kremlin interference in the U. S. presidential election.",
        "Diane Rehm is wrapping up a public radio career spanning more than four decades and thousands of episodes. Her talk show has originated at Washington, D. C.\u2019s WAMU and is heard by nearly 3 million people across the country weekly on NPR stations. Yet The Diane Rehm Show almost didn\u2019t get off the ground. In 1979, Rehm started as a host with a program aimed at homemakers. Several years later, she informed her boss that she had other plans. \u201dI\u2019m bored. I\u2019m really bored,\u201d Rehm remembers telling him.",
        "Hanukkah commemorates the rededication by the Maccabees of the Temple in Jerusalem. It honors the lighting of the menorah, a representation of the spiritual strength of the Jewish people.

        "It\u2019s the holidays. You maybe have some time off, and you\u2019re maybe thinking that, between doing all those things you swear you\u2019re going to do before you return to work in January, maybe you\u2019re going to take a minute for yourself. Except you\u2019re not sure how to spend that time. So here\u2019s our holiday gift to you: A roundup of some of the things we liked that we think you might too. So settle into a comfy chair, pull that Slanket around you (don\u2019t front we know you\u2019ve used one) and enjoy.",
        "Ken Yeh thought his school was buying software to keep kids off of certain websites. What he didn\u2019t know was that it could help identify a student who might be considering suicide. Yeh is the technology director at a private school near Los Angeles. Three years ago, the school began buying Chromebook laptops for students to use in class and at home. That, Yeh says, raised concerns from parents about what they\u2019d be used for, especially outside of school.",
        "Jeneyah McDonald is tired of using bottled water for everything: drinking, cooking, bathing. In order to keep her two children safe, the resident of Flint, Mich. told them the city tap water was poisonous. \u201dI don\u2019t know any way to explain to a why you can\u2019t take a bath anymore every day, why you can\u2019t help mommy wash the dishes anymore,\u201d McDonald said earlier this year. \u201dSo I told him it\u2019s poison.",
        "A man who police believe killed a boy in an apparent fit of road rage was arrested in Little Rock, Ark. Thursday night. The U. S. Marshals Service says Gary Eugene Holmes, 33, was taken into custody without incident. The arrest comes nearly one week after the boy, Acen King, was shot last Saturday night while on a shopping trip with his grandmother, who was driving the car when another motorist got out of his car at an intersection and fired at her vehicle. King\u2019s funeral will take place in Little Rock today.",
        "Twitter has a theory about Santa Claus \u2014 he might be a lot farther south than the North Pole. The tweet that started it all came from an account dedicated to celebrating \u201deverything NOLA.\u201d It featured a photo of Santa, holding a baby as he does, and a caption: \u201dIf you\u2019re from New Orleans you got pic with this Santa.\u201d One look at the responses makes it obvious that the caption was not at all an exaggeration.",
        "What began as a dispute over littering rapidly escalated into the arrest of a black woman and her two daughters Wednesday in Fort Worth, Texas. The incident was captured on video and has sparked an internal affairs inquiry into the white police officer who forcefully arrested the women. \u201dThe family\u2019s lawyer says racism is all over the incident,\u201d Christopher Connelly of member station KERA tells our Newscast unit. \u201dIn a statement, the department acknowledged that the video looks bad, but urged calm until an investigation is completed.",
        "Montana State Senator Ed Buttrey is a businessman from the central part of the state. Like a lot of Republicans, he\u2019s not a fan of the Affordable Care Act and its expansion of Medicaid, health insurance for the poor and disabled. \u201dWe didn\u2019t want to implement a plan that was another entitlement that just had a bunch of people signing up to get free or cheap or subsidized health care,\u201d says Buttrey, who represents Great Falls. \u201dWe wanted a plan that said, \u2019We\u2019re going to get you on. We\u2019re going to get you healthy."
