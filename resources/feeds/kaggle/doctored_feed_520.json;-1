        "Even after the Electoral College officially made Donald Trump our next president, a lot of Americans are still wondering how it happened. In part, anger is said to have fueled Trump\u2019s victory and to understand where that anger is coming from, some people are turning to books. Works of nonfiction, like the J. D. Vance\u2019s Hillbilly Elegy, are shooting to the top of lists, and Daniel Halpern, the publisher of Ecco books, is already fielding book proposals about the election and Trump\u2019s presidency. So far, they\u2019ve all been nonfiction, but fiction can also help explain how we got here.",
        "Spiritual quandaries \u2014 or at least questions of guilt \u2014 lace most of Martin Scorsese\u2019s films. Yet despite his Catholic upbringing, the director worships primarily at the church of cinema. Thus his stately if not quite transcendent adaptation of Shusaku Endo\u2019s 1966 novel Silence is as much a chance to impersonate great Japanese auteurs as it is an investigation of faith under duress.",
        "The director of the Central Intelligence Agency, John Brennan, is warning against retaliation by the U. S. government for Russian hacking during the presidential election. In an interview with NPR\u2019s Mary Louise Kelly, Brennan said, \u201dThey do some things that are beyond the pale,\u201d referencing those who would undermine democratic processes, adding: \u201dI don\u2019t think we should resort to some of the tactics and techniques that our adversaries employ against us.

        "We at NPR Music love a big, flashy rock \u2019n\u2019 roll concert as much as the next person. But we\u2019re especially fans of those moments when our favorite artists bring their music into smaller spaces, when singers and guitarists and producers and drummers reckon with the particular intimacy and joy that go along with performing in close quarters. That\u2019s the impulse behind our Tiny Desk series \u2014 and it\u2019s something we share with our partners at public radio stations across America, who record hundreds of sessions every year.",

        "Editor\u2019s note: This story was originally published in 2006. It\u2019s all about the oil. Through the eight days of Hanukkah, it almost doesn\u2019t matter what you eat, as long as it\u2019s cooked in oil. A good case could be made for eating potato chips with every meal throughout the holiday. The story goes that in 165 B. C. the Maccabees, a small band of pious Jews, led a revolt that defeated the powerful Hellenist imperial army.

Right now I\u2019m haunted by Ariana Grande\u2019s \u201dSanta Tell Me,\u201d which I heard for the first time while researching this article. Help me. There may be good reasons why a song like that becomes an earworm, according to Elizabeth Margulis, director of the music cognition lab at the University of Arkansas.

Leonard Cohen put out a record for his own 82nd birthday, and a few weeks later, he too was gone.

He made six foreign trips and oversaw many events and ceremonies with millions of pilgrims throughout what he proclaimed the Holy Year of Mercy. The year was also marked by the pope\u2019s efforts to heal divisions within the Christian world and tackle dissension within Catholicism.
