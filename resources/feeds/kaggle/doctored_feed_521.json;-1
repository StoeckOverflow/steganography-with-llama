        "In 2013, Dr. John Henning Schumann reminisced about a difficult assignment in his medical residency that helped him understand what it meant to be a good doctor. We\u2019re publishing the piece again for the holidays. December is supposed to be the time of year filled with family gatherings and holiday good cheer. For medical residents, quite the opposite is true. There are no school breaks during residency. Being a medical resident is a real job, and a stressful one at that.",
        "We\u2019ve all been there \u2014 hopelessly tangled in red tape, struggling to get a faceless bureaucracy to hear us. So the conversation that takes place under the opening credits of Ken Loach\u2019s absurdist dramedy, I, Daniel Blake, will be as familiar as it is sublimely ghastly. Daniel, played with exasperated stoicism by standup comic Dave Johns, is talking to an interviewer who\u2019s asking vaguely medical questions, but who is neither a doctor nor a nurse \u2014 \u201dI\u2019m a health care professional,\u201d she intones when challenged.",

But Syrian officials say there are other areas where local truces have averted deadly military takeovers, and which offer the only way forward for the country. One of those areas is the Damascus suburb of Qudsaya. There, a \u201dreconciliation\u201d was brokered with the help of local religious leaders, activists and the rebels themselves.

        "There\u2019s a great quote by Haruki Murakami: \u201dIf you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking.\u201d This, of course, is because it also means that if you want to think more broadly and gain a larger understanding of the world, you will seek out lesser known books, and from different places. In 2016, small publishers like New Directions and Coffee House Press and lauded indie powerhouses like Melville House continue to bring many deserving international voices to the forefront.",
        "Deadly encounters between police and civilians often made 2016 a year full of palpable tension. Across the country, demonstrators took to the streets to protest police shootings, while at the same time officers in a number of states were targeted and killed by gunmen. Both situations have prompted law enforcement to examine policies. Early next year, the FBI will take the first steps in developing a national database to track police shootings.",

Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss in the presidential race and Democratic failures further down the ballot have the party searching for a way forward.

        ", It\u2019s a time of year when we\u2019re often urged to be grateful for friends, for family, for presents under the tree. But not everyone experiences gratitude as a positive force in their life. People who score higher on measures of autonomy experience less overall gratitude and value it less, according to experiments conducted by Anthony Ahrens, an associate professor of psychology at American University, and his colleagues. Autonomous folks who really value independence might feel that gratitude undermines that independence, says Ahrens.",

His father was setting up Christmas lights when a ladder slipped out from beneath his feet. \u201dHis whole entire side was scratched up,\u201d Lentine says. Thousands of people get hurt this way in the winter. In the last two months of 2015, 14, 000 Americans ended up in the emergency room with injuries, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

And it\u2019s likely mom and dad are a little digitally distracted too. In many households, screens are omnipresent. That reality has some big implications for children.
