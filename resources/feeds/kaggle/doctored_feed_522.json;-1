        "This story is the second in a report on conditions at mobile home parks in the U. S. Read part one here. If you had strolled one Saturday afternoon through the Park Plaza neighborhood in Fridley, Minn. you might have thought you were at just another block party. The residents were milling around a picnic buffet on folding tables on the street in front of their houses and the American flag. Kids were tossing beanbags and shouting. Neighbors were delivering and marshmallow salad, and a pot of pork, cilantro and beans. But this was not an ordinary picnic.",
        "Donald Trump is lashing out in defense of his charitable foundation as he prepares to shutter it before taking the oath of office next month. And in doing so, Trump incorrectly stated the charitable reach of the Donald J. Trump Foundation. In a series of tweets Monday evening, Trump said he had given millions to the foundation he began in 1987 and that all of the money raised went to \u201dwonderful charities.\u201d But extensive reporting over the past year has shown those claims to be overstated.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s type of wealth \u2014 based largely on the value of his brand name and on global real estate holdings \u2014 doesn\u2019t fit well with existing ethics laws, which were written for an earlier time when rich politicos mainly invested in stocks and bonds. To be clear, some ethics laws do apply to the incoming president. \u201dHe\u2019s still subject to bribery laws, he\u2019s subject to the STOCK Act, which prohibits insider trading,\u201d says Larry Noble, general counsel for the Campaign Legal Center, which supports laws. What doesn\u2019t apply to presidents is the federal law.",
        "In San Francisco, companies will pay salaries to tech workers from all over the world. So this might come as a surprise: A public university there is laying off some of its own IT staff and sending their jobs to a contractor with headquarters in India. Until recently, Hank Nguyen\u2019s daughter wanted to follow in his footsteps and work in tech. Last spring, she was accepted into the University of California system. \u201dShe was inclined to take computer science and engineering,\u201d Nguyen says. But then the letters started arriving. The first was a hefty tuition bill.",
        "Charlie Oen\u2019s battle with addiction started when he was 16 and his family moved to Lima, Ohio. It was the last stop in a string of moves his military family made \u2014 from Panama to North Carolina, Kentucky, Texas and Germany. \u201dI went toward a bad group because those were the people that accepted me,\u201d he says. Drugs became a substitute for real friendships. He started drinking, popping pills, cooking meth and shooting heroin. He was homeless for a while when his parents kicked him out of the house.",
        "President Donald Trump will hold the keys, or the codes, to America\u2019s nuclear weapons arsenal in a few short weeks. On Thursday, the president elect tweeted that the United States should expand its nuclear capability, which could suggest a strategy counter to that of decades of presidential administrations \u2014 crossing party lines \u2014 aiming to decrease the role of nuclear weapons in U. S. defense policy.",
        "The Washington Post expects to hire more than 60 journalists in the coming months \u2014 a sign of remarkable growth for a newspaper in the digital age. After a year of record traffic and digital advertising revenue, the Post newsroom will grow by more than 8 percent, to more than 750 people. The extent of the newsroom expansion was first reported by Politico. The Post will add a \u201d \u201d investigative team, expand its video journalism and breaking news staff, and make additional investments in podcasts and photography.",
        "To get a glimpse of where Medicaid may be headed after Donald Trump moves into the White House, it may be wise to look to Indiana. That\u2019s where Seema Verma, Trump\u2019s pick to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, comes from. And that\u2019s where she put her stamp on the state\u2019s health care program for the poor. Verma is a private consultant who was hired by Indiana Gov. and Vice Mike Pence to design a expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.",
        "After Rubi Ibarra\u2019s father invited \u201deverybody\u201d to her quincea\u00f1era, more than a million people RSVP\u2019d to say they\u2019d be attending the bash. Most of those people were having a lark. But not all of them: The Monday night party in northern Mexico was, indeed, a celebration for the ages. More than 30, 000 people showed up, reports Univision, citing the local civil protection agency. El Heraldo pegs the number at 20, 000. Rubi\u2019s hometown, Villa de Guadalupe, is home to about 140 residents, NPR\u2019s Carrie Kahn has reported.",
        "In Jim Jarmusch\u2019s 2013 film Only Lovers Left Alive the members of a vampiric odd couple live continents apart, but are linked by shared hipster tastes in music and literature. The \u2019s Paterson is essentially the same movie, except that this time the lovers live together in New Jersey, and have very different enthusiasms. Yet they\u2019re just as hip, in their gentle, domestic way. Paterson is a nostalgic celebration of things that Jarmusch loves, from movies to Ohio Blue Tip matchboxes to Iggy Pop (the central figure in the director\u2019s recent documentary, Gimme Danger).",
        "One of the most controversial questions in education has been whether preschool \u2014 and specifically Head Start \u2014 helps kids succeed as they move through elementary school. Critics have long noted, and research has supported, that the benefits of Head Start fade in a few years. It\u2019s an important question for an $8 billion federal program that provides support for nearly a million children and their families. This year brought several new studies, however, that found that \u2014 when done right \u2014 Head Start and other programs can give students lasting benefits.",
        "The world may forever remember him as the \u201980s Wham! frontman who turned serious in the \u201990s and in the next century retired from fame while generating tabloid infamy. But George Michael\u2019s skill at singing, writing, producing and playing on most of his hits set him apart from most teenybop idols, as did the quality and durability of his tunes.",
        "All year long in my Viking\u2019s Choice column, I attempt to simultaneously crush and widen the ears of All Songs Considered fans. As is now tradition, Bob Boilen and I get together on this last show of the year to discuss all things metallic, psychedelic, synthetic and exploratory. You\u2019ll hear about a metal band\u2019s most feral album ever, synth artists imagining a dystopian society and mimicking ocean waves, an cutting the dance floor into cubist shapes and more.",
        "Rosemary Navarro was living in Mexico when her brother called from California. Something wasn\u2019t right with their mom, then in her early 40s. She was having trouble paying bills and keeping jobs as a food preparer in convalescent homes. Navarro, then 22, sold her furniture to pay for a trip back to the U. S. for herself and her two young children. Almost as soon as she arrived, she knew her mother wasn\u2019t the same person. \u201dShe was there but sometimes she wasn\u2019t there,\u201d she said.",
        "On Jan. 20, 2016, exactly a year before a new president would be sworn into office, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia announced the court\u2019s decision reinstating the death penalty for two Kansas brothers. It was the last time the Scalia would announce an opinion. Three weeks later, on a hunting trip in Texas, the conservative icon died in his sleep. Since then, the year has been one long ride for the Supreme Court, with the eight remaining justices putting off the most controversial cases while President Obama and the U. S. Senate struggled over filling the vacancy.",
        "In an interview released Monday, President Obama expressed confidence that he would have won the 2016 election had it been possible for him to seek a third term. The president\u2019s remarks were hypothetical: The 22nd Amendment to the Constitution limits presidents to two terms in office. Obama made his remarks to The Axe Files, the podcast of his former adviser David Axelrod, now director of the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. The president argued that a majority of Americans continue to support his progressive vision for the country.",
        "On my first New Year\u2019s Eve in Madrid a few years ago, we went out around 10 p. m. and found the streets deserted. The bars were closed. It threw me for a loop: Weren\u2019t Madrile\u00f1os supposed to be notorious party animals? Where were they all? It turns out, I just went out way too early. Spaniards often spend Nochevieja \u2014 literally, the \u201dold night\u201d \u2014 at home. They watch the countdown to the new year on live TV, surrounded by family. And only then do they kiss grandma goodnight and go out partying.",
        "Donald Trump and @realDonaldTrump are contradicting each other. Wednesday afternoon, Trump emerged from his resort to tell reporters that he and President Obama had spoken on the phone and had \u201da very nice conversation.\u201d \u201dI appreciate that he called me,\u201d Trump said. The comment came hours after Trump blasted Obama on Twitter. But asked by reporters Wednesday afternoon how that transition was going, Trump said, \u201dI think very, very smoothly. Very good.",
        "Oh, 2016. The year it all went to hell. The year nothing made sense. The year we lost track of reality. The year made \u201dsurreal\u201d its word of the year. For many, 2016 hasn\u2019t just been awful and strange it\u2019s become its own catchphrase. 2016 itself has become its own meme. Where were you when you decided this would be how we remembered the year? When you decided 2016 was pure trash, utter filth, a fire in a dumpster? Was it when David Bowie died? Or when Prince ended his purple reign?",
        "Some politicians seem to have nine lives, constantly evading scandal and overcoming the odds. But this past year, Donald Trump may have had more than that. Many things he did would have been the death knell for any other candidate\u2019s political hopes \u2014 mocking a disabled reporter, bragging about groping, disparaging a Gold Star family and even boasting about his manhood during a national debate. But every time political pundits and reporters thought Trump was done for, he seemed to rise like a phoenix from the ashes.",
        "With his tenure as secretary of state rapidly pulling to a close, John Kerry made an impassioned defense for a solution in the conflict on Wednesday. Kerry said he is concerned that some Israeli politicians are rejecting it. \u201dIf the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic it cannot be both, and it won\u2019t ever really be at peace,\u201d said Kerry. Speaking at the State Department, Kerry sharply criticized the Israeli government\u2019s construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank. He said the policy was dimming the prospect of peace.",
        "Amazon\u2019s personal assistant device called Echo was one of the most popular gifts this Christmas. But this week, the device grabbed headlines for another reason: Police in Arkansas are trying to use its data in a murder investigation. What we know from court documents is that in November 2015, a man in Arkansas had some friends over at his house to watch a football game and in the morning, one of the friends was found dead in a hot tub in the backyard. Police later charged the man who lived in the house, James Bates, with murder.",
        "Studies of fish oil and health are like studies about coffee \u2014 there\u2019s plenty of contradictory information out there. With that in mind, here\u2019s the latest turn: A Danish study finds that women who took fish oil supplements during pregnancy reduced the risk of asthma in their children. \u201dI would say that the finding that the effect was there was maybe not the surprise, because there have been indications,\u201d says the study\u2019s lead researcher, Dr. Hans Bisgaard, of the University of Copenhagen.",
        "The man convicted of the deadly shooting rampage at a Charleston, South Carolina church says he won\u2019t call witnesses or offer evidence that could spare his life in the penalty phase of his murder trial. Dylann Roof also reaffirmed his plan Wednesday to represent himself as he faces the death penalty in the final phase of his trial. U. S Judge Richard Gergel expressed misgivings over Roof\u2019s decision, Reuters reports: \u201d\u2019I think it\u2019s a bad idea,\u2019 Gergel warned, encouraging Roof to discuss his decision with his family and lawyers.",
        "Talking publicly about women\u2019s menstruation has long been a taboo. But in 2016 the world made big strides getting over the squeamishness. There was the Chinese swimmer at the Rio Olympics who had no qualms explaining that she was on her period after she finished a race grimacing in pain. Some medical students in India launched a \u201dhaiku\u201d contest on menstruation. New York joined the growing number of states that have ended taxation of tampons and sanitary pads.",
        "When Almothana Alhamoud, a Syrian data analyst, arrived in Chicago two years ago after fleeing the Syrian war, he jumped at his first job offer, a nightshift cashier at a convenience store. \u201dWhen I came over here I just want to find anything to survive,\u201d he says over dinner with his family in Chicago. His parents and two sisters fled Damascus six months after he did. The family has applied for asylum in the U. S. Alhamoud has a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer engineering.",
        "Chinese officials have seized 3. 1 tonnes (more than 3. 4 tons) of illegally trafficked pangolin scales from a port in Shanghai, according to state media. It\u2019s the largest such seizure China has ever made, Xinhua News Agency reports. Pangolins are the world\u2019s most widely trafficked mammals \u2014 their meat is a delicacy and their scales are used in traditional Chinese medicine. All eight species of pangolin are facing extinction. \u201dThe pangolin is about the size of a raccoon and looks like an artichoke with legs,\u201d NPR\u2019s Jackie Northam wrote last year.",
        "It\u2019s not yet Oscar season, but buzz is building about the performance of a Chinese candidate. On Dec. 24, a woman in the city of Nanyang, in central China\u2019s Henan province, was caught on a dashcam as she ran across a road and launched herself onto a car. It\u2019s a scam in China. Suspects will seek out a car driving at a slow speed and hurl themselves in front of it, only to ask for compensation afterward."
