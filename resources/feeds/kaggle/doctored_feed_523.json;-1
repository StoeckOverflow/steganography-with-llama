        "At first glance food policy appears like it has been on a slow march through legislating the production, market supply chain (either for local and regional or the export) for decency of treatment for food and food processing employees as it concerns safety, paying a \u201cLawrence Wise minimum-would have-be\u201d for those working hard on food and in its\u2019 processing (as opposed for \u201cfool\u2019y\u2019ing-on the side, for fun) in America today, and a slow crawl as to food and farmy",
        "Vegan schnitzel? Veggie w\u00fcrst? and meatless meatballs? There\u2019s no such thing, says Germany\u2019s agricultural minister. He\u2019s crying fowl over product packaging, and is calling for a ban on using terms to describe meatless products. In an interview with Germany\u2019s Bild newspaper, Christian Schmidt said terms like \u201dvegetarian schnitzel\u201d are \u201dcompletely misleading and unsettle consumers,\u201d according to a translation by The Associated Press.",
        "Here\u2019s the biggest understatement of the year: 2016 was the most disruptive moment the mainstream American news media have faced in a very long time. That\u2019s not because so many media outlets misread the presidential election, although that is part of it. And it\u2019s not just because \u201dfake news\u201d has become a genuine issue, prompting Facebook and other social media outlets to address fraudulent items formatted to look like legitimate news reports \u2014 a change. It\u2019s because a number of disturbing trends eating away at the effectiveness of modern news media came to a head in this year\u2019s election.",
        "Actress Carrie Fisher, beloved for her iconic role as Princess Leia, died on Tuesday at the age of 60. She leaves behind her daughter, Billie Lourd, her brother, Todd Fisher, her mother, Debbie Reynolds \u2014 and her French bulldog, Gary. Gary Fisher is a celebrity in his own right \u2014 he traveled widely with Fisher and was a star on Instagram and Twitter. And when Carrie Fisher visited NPR\u2019s studios in New York City, to talk to Fresh Air host Terry Gross, Gary came along, too. Gross, however, was in Philadelphia.",
        "Authorities in Germany have detained a man for questioning in connection to the deadly attack on a Christmas market in Berlin earlier this month. Last week, police in Milan, Italy, shot and killed Anis Amri, the Tunisian man suspected of driving a truck into the market on Dec. 19. Twelve people died in that attack. Now they are questioning a man whose phone number was found in Amri\u2019s cellphone. \u201dThis new suspect is also from Tunisia and police say investigations indicate he may have been involved in the attack,\u201d Kerry Skyring reports for NPR.",
        "If you took the \u201980s \u2014 by which I mean not necessarily the real \u201980s, but the cultural \u201980s, the popular idea of the \u201980s \u2014 and you put them over a low flame for many hours until only the essence remained, and then you took that essence and you painted it onto a piece of acetate and you held that acetate up to the light, what you would see is a single still frame of George Michael dancing in Wham! \u2019s \u201dWake Me Up Before You \u201d video.",
        "People in Columbia, S. C. had their pick of four health insurers last year when they shopped for policies during the Affordable Care Act\u2019s open enrollment. This time they have just one: Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Carolina, which had the most Obamacare enrollees in Richland County in 2016 due to its low prices. It\u2019s a change that\u2019s been repeated around the country after big health insurers such as Aetna, Humana and United Healthcare pulled out of dozens of Obamacare marketplaces that they judged unprofitable.",
        "It started with a cup of coffee, or more precisely, a hot beverage. Seven years later came fries, the now infamous eggplant and friends. Sandwich lovers waited for their time to come, while begrudgingly sending another drumstick, wishing it were barbecue. Food and drinks account for just 82 of around 2, 000 emojis approved by the Unicode Consortium, the official body that regulates what emojis are added and their appearance, ensuring they work on different devices.",
        "This year we\u2019ve learned an amazing amount about Zika \u2014 how it damages developing brains, how it spreads through sexual contact and where in the world (and the U. S.) it\u2019s hiding out. But there has been one big question lingering: What risk does Zika pose to pregnant women and their fetuses? How scared should they be of it? More specifically, what\u2019s the chance a woman will have a healthy baby if she catches Zika during her pregnancy? Finally, scientists are starting to figure it out. And at first, it seems like good news.",
        "At a busy office in central Rome, the man who oversees Italy\u2019s national network of committees that process asylum requests sits behind a desk with tall piles of folders. Angelo Trovato says each committee has three members \u2014 representing police, local authorities and the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR. \u201dEach applicant is interviewed by one committee member,\u201d says Trovato. \u201dBut when it comes to deciding the destiny of an individual, the decision can\u2019t be by a single person.",
        "Updated at 6:15 p. m. The White House has announced new actions targeting Russia in response to what U. S. officials say were cyberattacks intended to interfere with the U. S. election. In a statement Thursday, President Obama said, \u201dAll Americans should be alarmed by Russia\u2019s actions,\u201d referring to hacks of the Democratic National Committee. Obama also cited an \u201dunacceptable level of harassment\u201d of American diplomats by Russian security services and police in Moscow. The immediate impact of the president\u2019s executive order is that 35 Russian diplomats will be expelled from the U. S.",
        "The actress Debbie Reynolds\u2019 death just one day after her daughter, Carrie Fisher, died has led some to speculate that grief from the loss might have been a contributing factor. There was similar speculation when actress Brittany Murphy\u2019s husband, Simon Monjack, was found dead at just 39, several months after the sudden death of his wife. It\u2019s a common theme in literature \u2014 10 of Shakespeare\u2019s characters die of strong emotion \u2014 but is it actually possible to die of a broken heart? The short answer is, maybe.",
        "Here\u2019s a timely reminder for all you revelers out there: Be careful with your countdowns this New Year\u2019s Eve. There will be a little extra time to bask in the glow of a retreating 2016 \u2014 or curse its name, as the case may be. Whatever your inclination may be, one thing is certain: Before the year is out, the world\u2019s foremost authority on time will be adding one more second to the clock.",
        "Every year in late November, the New Mexican village of Abiquiu, about an hour northwest of Santa Fe, celebrates the town saint, Santo Tomas. Townfolk file into the beautiful old adobe Catholic church to pay homage its namesake. But this is no ordinary saint\u2019s day. Dancers at the front of the church are dressed in feathers, face paint and ankle bells that honor their forebears \u2014 captive Indian slaves called genizaros. The dances and chants are Native American, but they don\u2019t take place on a Pueblo Indian reservation.",
        "Time to get together the transcripts and the test scores and put the final touches on those personal essays. It\u2019s college application season, again. To a lot of students, the process seems wrapped in a shroud of mystery. What exactly happens when you send your application out into the unknown only to . .. wait? Well, here\u2019s a glimpse behind the curtain at one school. Inside a tiny conference room at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass. the admissions committee is preparing to review 23 applications.",
        "Hollywood is in the process of closing out a $11. 2 billion year. The big draws were talking animals \u2014 including a fish called Dory and a bear named Baloo \u2014 a slew of superheroes and a new batch of Star Warriors. The numbers have movie studios \u2014 especially Disney, which led the pack \u2014 celebrating. But this year, moviegoers also have a lot to celebrate. Most years, there are several films that could fill the No. 1 slot on my list. This year, there\u2019s no contest.",
        "Dealing with a flood of pardon requests amounted to one of the biggest surprises of his presidency, George W. Bush once wrote. Bush declared himself \u201ddisgusted\u201d by how many people exploited their connections to make personal appeals. Now, President Obama faces the same set of difficult decisions on the way out the door, with many applicants requesting clemency in the president\u2019s final weeks in office. White House press secretary Josh Earnest recently warned applicants not to get their hopes up. \u201dHe does not expect to essentially ram through any pardons at the last minute,\u201d Earnest said.",
        "Rashaan Salaam, the former college football standout whose body was found in a Boulder, Colo. park earlier this month, died of a gunshot wound to the head, according to the Boulder County Coroner\u2019s office.

He went on to play parts of four seasons in the NFL, winning the NFC Rookie of the Year award with the Chicago Bears in 1995.",
        "On the top of Hawaii\u2019s Mauna Kea mountain Thursday, astronomers will point the large Subaru Telescope toward a patch of sky near the constellation of Orion, looking for an extremely faint object moving slowly through space. If they find what they\u2019re looking for, it will be one of the most important astronomical discoveries in more than a century: a new planet in our solar system. Technically, a new planet hasn\u2019t been discovered since Neptune was spotted in 1846. Pluto, discovered in 1930, was demoted to \u201ddwarf planet\u201d a decade ago.",
        "A tiny pink peanut is not a white rhinoceros. Nor is it a green turtle or a Bengal tiger. But until a few years ago the Carolina African runner peanut \u2014 at one time, the South\u2019s most praised peanut, packed with flavor and rich with oil \u2014 was much like the rhinoceros and turtle and tiger. That is, it was nearly extinct. The Carolina African runner, like many heirloom cultivars of the South, was first brought to America in the 1600s by enslaved West Africans, who grew it in their backyard gardens.",
        "In a disappointment to Alzheimer\u2019s patients and researchers, drugmaker Eli Lilly said in late November that a clinical trial of solanezumab, an experimental medication to treat the degenerative neurological condition, had failed. The company has pressed on with tests of solanezumab, despite mixed results in earlier studies. The latest test, involving more than 2, 000 patients, found the drug didn\u2019t significantly slow cognitive decline in patients with mild dementia from Alzheimer\u2019s. The sad refrain is a familiar one, unfortunately. Solanezumab is just the latest casualty in a parade of disappointing dementia drug trials.",
        "In my early 20s, smitten by the mythic underpinnings of American popular music, I built an Elvis shrine in my living room. It largely consisted of magazine clips that my parents\u2019 next door neighbor Esther Schor had given me, culled from her own little tribute to the Memphis faun, which she\u2019d set up near her basement tiki bar.",
        "It\u2019s been a lively year for social media mavens as they hashtagged their way through the ups, the downs and the downright silly. The past 12 months have been characterized by radical political change, and folks around the world have used hashtags to launch serious debates about politicians and policies. In Zimbabwe, as Goats and Soda reported earlier this year, activists used slogans like #ThisFlag to demand government reform. Meanwhile, Indians and Chinese hashtagged their woes. And Thai women posted pictures of themselves bathing in potholes to draw attention to unrepaired, crumbling roads.",
        "This is not a review. It started out as one: I fully intended to offer a considered critique of the new comics anthology Love is Love, in which various creators both within the comics industry (Gail Simone, Matt Millar, Jim Lee, G. Willow Wilson and more) and without it (Matt Bomer, Patton Oswalt, Morgan Spurlock, John Ross Bowie, Taran Killam and more) produce dozens of brief \u2014 \u2014 reactions to the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando.",
        "On a summer\u2019s day in December, a warehouse in Melbourne, Australia, was filled with two things \u2014 gingerbread houses and people who were willing to spend good money to smash them. In the center, a giant gingerbread house was surrounded by the items of its impending doom: mallets, baseball bats, rolling pins, frying pans. Smaller edible homes bordered the room, waiting to be raffled for private destruction. There was even a karate chop station.",
        "Elections aren\u2019t exactly cozy, even in the best of times. This one, though, felt worse for a lot of people. No matter where your allegiances lie, 2016 has been the emotional equivalent of a dumpster fire. But it wasn\u2019t all unbearable. Here and there, lighter moments emerged to provide comic relief \u2014 or even a small burst of joy. Here are 10 of them, in no particular order. When the balloons fell from the rafters on the final night of the Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton and her running mate Tim Kaine had a lot to feel triumphant about.",
        "Although her oldest child, Ben, is 10 years old, Andrea Scher, 44, feels like a new mom again. Scher suffered from maternal depression after Ben was born, eventually recovering with the help of antidepressants and psychotherapy. She was understandably relieved that her depression didn\u2019t return after the birth of her second son. But now she\u2019s struggling again. Once more, Scher is having anxiety attacks and it\u2019s difficult for her to sleep through the night. \u201dAt 3 a. m.",
        "When a political scandal explodes in France, there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019s Wednesday. That\u2019s the day satirical newspaper Le Canard Enchain\u00e9 hits newsstands. The fiercely independent weekly, known for its incisive and derisive reporting and more than its share of scoops and bombshells, turns 100 this year. Despite the economic downturn, changing media landscape and a print press crisis, Le Canard Enchain\u00e9 continues to do well. Remarkably, it takes no advertising and has only a webpage that often just summarizes what\u2019s on the print front page.",
        "The darkest moment for American police this year was July 7 in downtown Dallas, when police officers providing security for a peaceful protest march suddenly found themselves under attack. And those weren\u2019t the only cops targeted this year. Deadly ambushes followed in Baton Rouge, Des Moines and Palm Springs. As a result, many police will remember 2016 as a grim chapter in what many call the \u201dwar on cops.\u201d These of officers created a sense that they were under siege, threatening to poison the debate over police reform.",
        "Russia was ordered to vacate two compounds it owns in Maryland and New York, as part of the sanctions imposed Thursday by the White House to punish Russia for its meddling in last month\u2019s U. S. presidential election. \u201dThey are compounds that the Russian government owns and that they use for multiple purposes .. . intelligence, but also recreational, as well,\u201d said a senior White House official in a call with press on Thursdsay."
