QUESTION: What are your thoughts on the UK\u2019s economic outlook after Prime Minister May\u2019s comments yesterday indicating it would leave the single market?",
        "U. S. consumer prices increased in December as households paid more for gasoline and rental accommodation, leading to the largest increase in years and signaling that inflation pressures could be building. The rise in inflation, coming as economic growth strengthens, was corroborated by a separate report on Wednesday from the Federal Reserve, which said pricing pressures \u201dintensified\u201d somewhat from late November through the end of 2016. The trend, if sustained, may push the U. S. central bank to raise interest rates at a faster pace than currently anticipated. The Fed has forecast three rate hikes this year.",
        "The United Nations Security Council needs to push Iran to abide by an arms embargo, outgoing U. S. Ambassador Samantha Power said on Wednesday amid U. N. concerns that Tehran has supplied weapons and missiles to Lebanese Shi\u2019ite group Hezbollah. Most U. N. sanctions were lifted a year ago under a deal Iran made with Britain, France, Germany, China, Russia, the United States and the European Union to curb its nuclear program. But Iran is still subject to an arms embargo and other restrictions, which are not technically part of the nuclear agreement.",
        "Nearly 80 rights groups on Wednesday accused Facebook ( ) of \u201dracially biased censorship\u201d and failing to be more transparent about its removal policies and cooperation with law enforcement, adding to criticism the company has faced in recent months over its management of content on its network of 1. 8 billion users. The sharp rebuke, sent in response to a December letter from Senior Vice President Joel Kaplan, reflected increasing impatience among advocacy groups that say Facebook has inadequately addressed their concerns despite repeated promises of action from senior executives.",
        "The department in a complaint filed with an administrative judge in Washington said the company was prohibited from engaging in racial discrimination given the hundreds of millions of dollars it receives as a contractor with the federal government. Oracle America is a unit of Oracle Corp. Oracle spokeswoman Deborah Hellinger in a statement said the claims were baseless and \u201dpolitically motivated,\u201d and that the company bases employment decisions on experience and merit. \u201dOracle values diversity and inclusion, and is a responsible equal opportunity and affirmative action employer,\u201d she said.",
        "Some senior regulators are privately raising doubts over whether politically unpopular European rules seeking to shield taxpayers from bank bailouts will ever be enforced as intended. \u201d \u201d were trumpeted as the centerpiece of Europe\u2019s response to the financial crisis, but some of the people who will have to apply them are now questioning in private whether they will be used following the Italian government\u2019s rescue of the troubled Monte dei Paschi di Siena ( ). The rules demand that private investors must suffer some losses before public money is used to rescue a bank.",
        "Donald Trump is preparing to sign executive actions on his first day in the White House on Friday to take the opening steps to crack down on immigration, build a wall on the U. S. border and roll back outgoing President Barack Obama\u2019s policies. Trump, a Republican elected on Nov. 8 to succeed Democrat Obama, arrived in Washington on a military plane with his family a day before he will be sworn in during a ceremony at the U. S. Capitol.",

        "Mexico extradited its drug lord Joaquin \u201dEl Chapo\u201d Guzman to New York on Thursday, likely ending a criminal career that included two jail breaks and a lead role in a national drug war, the day before Donald Trump assumes the U. S. presidency. Mexican officials said the timing of the move was both a gift to outgoing U. S. President Barack Obama and an olive branch to Trump, who has regularly insulted Mexico and threatened to tear up the NAFTA trade agreement that underpins its economy.",
        "Shortly after Donald Trump won the U. S. presidential election in November, Vice Mike Pence visited the country\u2019s largest manufacturing lobby group, six blocks from the White House, to brainstorm about Trump\u2019s legislative agenda.

        "Donald Trump\u2019s national security transition has been more chaotic than others in recent memory, with important positions unfilled and many of his people less able, or willing, to engage on substance, U. S. officials said.

S. and foreign diplomats.",
