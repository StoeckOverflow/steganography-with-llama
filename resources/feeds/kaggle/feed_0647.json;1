        "Chancellor Angela Merkel pushed back on Friday against renewed criticism of Germany\u2019s trade surplus from U. S. President Donald Trump, who told EU officials Germany was \u201dvery bad\u201d on trade and suggested it was selling too many cars in the United States.

        "(Reuters Breakingviews) Donald Trump\u2019s looming decision about whether to keep the United States in the Paris climate agreement will be, let\u2019s say, anticlimactic. It will be a surprise if the skeptic who has called the phenomenon a hoax breaks a campaign pledge by sticking with the 2015 agreement. If he pulls out, though, the actual impact on the climate and on global efforts to limit warming will be limited. The accord reached in the French capital 18 months ago among nearly 200 countries should have more than enough momentum even without Washington\u2019s support.",

        "The fate of President Donald Trump\u2019s order to ban travelers from six predominantly Muslim nations, blocked by federal courts, may soon be in the hands of the Supreme Court, where his appointee Neil Gorsuch could help settle the matter.

The comments came two days after Moody\u2019s downgraded China\u2019s sovereign ratings by one notch to A1, saying it expects the financial strength of the world\u2019s economy to erode in coming years as growth slows and debt continues to mount.",
        "As OPEC\u2019s latest meeting wrapped up in Vienna on Thursday night, ministers congratulated each other on its rare spirit of amity and consensus. The talks were, without a doubt, a success. But two hours later, one veteran delegate was staring in despair at the numbers flashing red on his smartphone showing crude down some 5 percent to $51 a barrel. \u201dThat is a disaster,\u201d he said.",
        "In the mountains above Caracas, two government officials often stand watch over the antennas of TV news network Globovision, poised to take it off air if regulators object to coverage of protests, according to two station employees.

        "With trouble facing him back home, U. S. President Donald Trump ended his overseas journey in dramatic fashion on Saturday, addressing U. S. troops at a rally. Trump flipped traditional U. S. foreign policy upside down on his tour through the Middle East and Europe, coddling Middle Eastern leaders with questionable human rights records while demanding traditional European allies pay more for their defense. At a Group of Seven summit in the resort town of Taormina on the island of Sicily, Trump refused to entreaties from the other six allies to maintain U. S.",

        "\u201dSell in May and go away\u201d is perhaps the oldest saw on Wall Street, but it appears there\u2019s no shortage of U. S. mutual funds doing exactly that this year. After all, the S&P 500 has delivered a total return, including reinvested dividends, of 10. 8 percent over the last six months, essentially capturing all of the average rolling total return on the index since 1990, so why not cash in? Indeed, political drama and high valuations are clearly driving some investors to take profits. American fund investors have yanked more than $17 billion from U. S."
