        "Pearson\u2019s hospitalization, disclosed on Dec. 25, is the latest challenge for the Canadian drugmaker whose shares have fallen nearly 60 percent since late August in the face of questions from Congress, investors and customers about how it prices and sells drugs. Valeant only last week said a group of company executives would take over for Pearson until he returned, an unusual arrangement that sent shares diving. Pearson, who joined Valeant as CEO in 2010 after a career at consultancy McKinsey & Co, has made acquisitions that greatly increased Valeant\u2019s size and share price.",

        "Several Republican presidential hopefuls responded on Monday with a careful balance of defense and condemnation to news that armed militia members had taken over a remote wildlife refuge center in Oregon. Saturday\u2019s seizure of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, 30 miles (50 km) south of the small town of Burns, Oregon, poses a tricky balance for Republican candidates, who do not want to upset voters who may hold sympathetic views toward the government arguments of the militia members.",

        "A sale would represent the latest effort by Verizon, the No. 1 U. S. wireless carrier, to streamline its portfolio following a divestment last year of a chunk of its landline business and a portfolio of wireless towers. It would also mark a reversal of its strategy to expand in hosting and colocation services after it acquired data center operator Terremark Worldwide Inc in 2011 for $1. 4 billion.

A rift between Saudi Arabia and Iran over the Saudi execution of a Shi\u2019ite cleric failed to boost prices this week, as it appeared to put an end to speculation that OPEC members could agree production cuts to lift prices.
