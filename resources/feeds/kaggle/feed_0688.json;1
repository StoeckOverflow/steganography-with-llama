        "No. 3 U. S. railroad CSX Corp does not see any compelling benefits stemming from mergers of major railroads in North America and fears regulatory burdens could be attached to the approval of deals that would add to the cost of doing business, the railroad\u2019s top executive said on Wednesday. \u201dThe benefits seem somewhat unconvincing, I really think the Class I railroads have great opportunities to create shareholder value without mergers,\u201d Chief Executive Michael Ward told Reuters by phone when asked about Canadian Pacific\u2019s unsolicited bid for No. 4 U.

        "\u201dWe\u2019re not trying to the Germans or try to be like anyone else,\u201d Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields told reporters at the Detroit auto show, declining to forecast sales volume for the revival of the Continental, a model that was discontinued in 2002. Ford\u2019s U. S. luxury sales have lagged those of foreign competitors including BMW AG and Daimler AG\u2019s unit. Until the 1990s, Lincoln along with General Motors Co\u2019s Cadillac were far and away the U. S. luxury sales leaders. Fields said Ford has made \u201dmeaningful progress and significant momentum\u201d in reviving the Lincoln brand.",

        "Grueling revenge movie \u201dThe Revenant\u201d emerged as the Oscar on Thursday in nominations that pit movies against small personal dramas and once again shut actors of color out of the industry\u2019s biggest honors. The hashtag #OscarsSoWhite was quickly revived on Twitter. It had emerged last year, when only white actors received nods. Will Smith, who stars in football injury drama \u201dConcussion,\u201d and Idris Elba from \u201dBeasts of No Nation\u201d were among the black actors who were not nominated this year.

Just seven people were killed in Jakarta despite multiple blasts and a gunfight, and five of them were the attackers themselves, but the brazenness of the assault suggested a new brand of militancy in a country where strikes on police are common.",
        "The world\u2019s largest economy is a bulwark for an increasingly shaky global one, and has the most immediate positive prospects for generating inflation with a very low unemployment rate and a solid pace of private hiring. But a storm has blown through global markets since the start of this year, hitting stock markets, commodities and oil prices based on renewed worries that China, the world\u2019s second largest economy, is struggling. That has already led some to tone down their optimism over U. S.",
        "Tamara Fields, a Florida woman whose husband Lloyd died in the Nov. 9 attack on the police training center in Amman, said Twitter knowingly let the militant Islamist group use its network to spread propaganda, raise money and attract recruits.
