        "The first glimpse of a secretly negotiated U. S. prisoner exchange came on Saturday in a flurry of early morning electronic filings in federal courts from New York to California as prosecutors dropped sanctions violations cases against more than half a dozen Iranians. The legal steps were followed by Iran\u2019s announcement via state media that it was freeing four including Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian and Christian pastor Saeed Abedini and Amir Hekmati, a former U. S. Marine. Hours later, Secretary of State John Kerry said they had all been released and would soon be on their way home.",
        "NEW YORK In recent years, bond investor Jeffrey Gundlach has been outperforming his rival Bill Gross. He has even been dubbed the \u201dBond King\u201d by the media a title Gross has held for many years. Now, Gundlach has replaced Gross on a investor panel. Weekly financial magazine Barron\u2019s said on Saturday that Gross decided to quit its Barron\u2019s Roundtable. Instead, Gundlach, who has often been critical of Gross\u2019s investment calls, was added to the panel which meets at the beginning and middle of each year and he features prominently in the magazine\u2019s Roundtable latest cover story published on Saturday.",
        "The growing feud between Republican Donald Trump and his central rival Ted Cruz intensified on Saturday with attacks that put to rest any notion that their debate night fight was a solitary engagement. The split between the two is evidence of the closeness of the race for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, particularly in Iowa. Polls there show a battle with little more than two weeks to go until Iowa on Feb. 1 stages the first nominating contest on the road to the Nov. 8 election.",
        "Taiwan should abandon its \u201dhallucinations\u201d about pushing for independence, as any moves towards it would be a \u201dpoison\u201d Chinese media said after a landslide victory for the island\u2019s opposition. Tsai and her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won a convincing victory in both presidential and parliamentary elections on Saturday, in what could usher in a new round of instability with China, which claims Taiwan as its own. Tsai pledged to maintain peace with its giant neighbour China, while China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office warned it would oppose any move towards independence and that Beijing was determined to defend the country\u2019s sovereignty.",
        "WASHINGTON U. S. President Barack Obama on Saturday laid out a plan to help support the income of workers who lose their jobs and end up in lower paying positions, as part of a push to get unemployed Americans back to work. The proposal would offer experienced workers who now make less than $50, 000 a form of wage insurance, allowing them to replace half of their lost pay. The benefit would cover up to $10, 000 over two years.",

        "The day before the Obama administration was due to slap new sanctions on Iran late last month, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif warned U. S. Secretary of State John Kerry the move could derail a prisoner deal the two sides had been negotiating in secret for months. Kerry and other top aides to President Barack Obama, who was vacationing in Hawaii, convened a series of conference calls and concluded they could not risk losing the chance to free Americans held by Tehran.",
        "construction projects have provided 1, 000 new dwellings for Palestinians left homeless by the 2014 Gaza war with Israel, and a similar number for families in the territory, officials said on Saturday. The Gulf state\u2019s contribution is the sole significant sign of rebuilding in the Gaza Strip, where some 100, 000 people remain displaced 18 months after the fighting, with economic growth stifled by Israeli and Egyptian blockades. The Qatari donations have buoyed Gaza\u2019s de facto Islamist Hamas rulers, irking Israel and the U. S. Palestinian administration based in the occupied West Bank.",
        "The United Nations\u2019 refugee agency will seek additional resources for Turkey, the world\u2019s largest host of refugees, and push for more resettlement, its head said on Saturday, as the war in Syria is set to enter its sixth year. Filipo Grandi, the U. N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) also cautioned against sentiment. A suicide bomber with links to Islamic State killed 10 German tourists in Istanbul this week after registering as a refugee, according to Turkish officials.",
        "Bill Clinton may not be the \u201csecret weapon\u201d that Hillary Clinton needs in the U. S. presidential race. And the former Democratic president may not become the albatross that Republican candidate Donald Trump expects, either. Bill Clinton simply is not wielding that kind of influence \u2014 good or bad \u2014 over voters so far this year, according to a poll. A majority of Americans, including 73 percent of Democrats and 52 percent of Republicans, said Bill Clinton does not factor into their opinion of Hillary for president. ( ) The poll, conducted Jan.",
        "Three arrived in Germany after leaving Tehran on Sunday in a prisoner swap that followed the lifting of most international sanctions on Iran under a deal U. S. President Barack Obama said cut off Tehran\u2019s path to a nuclear bomb. In a sign of sustained readiness to track Iranian compliance with remaining United Nations curbs, the United States imposed fresh sanctions on 11 companies and individuals for supplying Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program. The Obama administration had delayed the step for more than two weeks during tense negotiations to free five American prisoners, according to people familiar with the matter.",
        "The United States imposed sanctions on 11 companies and individuals for supplying Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program in a move delayed by over two weeks so as not to endanger this weekend\u2019s release of U. S. prisoners, sources familiar with the matter said. The U. S. Treasury Department said it had blacklisted the Mabrooka Trading, and its owner Hossein Pournaghshband for helping Iran\u2019s produce carbon fiber for the program.

        "A purchase of more than 100 aircraft from Europe\u2019s Airbus may be one of Iran\u2019s first big deals in a trade and investment boom that could reshape the economy of the Middle East. \u201dThe legs of Iran\u2019s economy are now free of the chains of sanctions, and it\u2019s time to build and grow,\u201d President Hassan Rouhani tweeted on Sunday, a day after world powers lifted sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program.",
        "Iran\u2019s success in winning an end to international sanctions will only intensify a power struggle among the elite, and President Hassan Rouhani cannot count on domestic political support from the supreme leader before two critical elections. However, Tehran\u2019s leadership has now decided on a less confrontational foreign policy than in the past, although a restoration of full ties with the \u201dGreat Satan\u201d the United States remains out of the question, officials say. The scrapping of most U. S.",
        "Democratic White House candidate Bernie Sanders went on the offensive against Hillary Clinton on Sunday in the most contentious of their four presidential debates, accusing her of cozying up to Wall Street and misrepresenting his stance on healthcare and guns. Reflecting Sanders\u2019 rise in opinion polls, the two battled with new urgency over who was best suited to lead Democrats in the November election. Sanders cast himself as the outsider who would lead a political revolution, while Clinton touted her experience and embraced President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy.",

S. citizens who Iraqi lawmakers said on Monday had been kidnapped, which, if confirmed, would make them the first Americans abducted in the country since U. S. troops withdrew in 2011.

S. snooping.",
        "For China, whose President Xi Jinping is already taking an increasingly muscular approach to claims in the East and South China Sea, the question of Taiwan trumps any other of its territorial assertions in terms of sensitivity and importance. After eight years of calm in what had been one of Asia\u2019s powder kegs, the landslide election of an opposition leader, Tsai has thrust Taiwan back into the spotlight as one of the region\u2019s most sensitive security issues. Defeated Nationalist forces fled to Taiwan at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.",

S. presidential election for almost a quarter of a century, back when he supported Ross Perot\u2019s independent candidacy in 1992. But Republican Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 White House bid has motivated Wade to get involved and he plans to support the real estate mogul in Nevada\u2019s nominating caucus next month.

Iran, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) issued an order on Monday to increase production by 500, 000 bpd, the country\u2019s deputy oil minister said.

        "A minimal recovery in stock markets helped the dollar gain some ground on Monday against Europe\u2019s current safe havens of choice, the euro and the Swiss franc. With trade thinned out by the absence of U. S. markets for a holiday, China\u2019s yuan gained around half a percent on a Reuters report of new moves to add to funding costs for foreign players speculating against the currency.
