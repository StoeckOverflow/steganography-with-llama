        "Things were not looking too good a year ago for Georgia\u2019s top elections officer as he tried to stitch together a primary in the U. S. South. Efforts to bring Alabama and Arkansas online had stalled. Tennessee was threatening to defect.

        "But some emails, phone messages, and petitions sent by the Sanders boosters have backfired, upsetting superdelegates with their aggressive tone and leading many to dig in their heels for Clinton, according to interviews conducted by Reuters. The drive to flip Clinton\u2019s super delegates has not been sanctioned by Sanders\u2019 campaign, his spokesman Michael Briggs said. \u201dBernie\u2019s campaign is focused on reaching out to all voters and earning delegates at primaries and caucuses,\u201d he said in a statement, stressing that the Sanders campaign was not coordinating with supporters to contact superdelegates.

The department has been regularly releasing batches of her work emails in keeping with a judge\u2019s order.
