        "As the Republican race moves to the crucial battlegrounds of Ohio and Florida among three other states on Tuesday, Tea Party support promises to help Trump\u2019s campaign offset its relative lack of organization compared to Texas Senator Cruz, his closest rival nationally. Having loyal Tea Party supporters could also help him fend off moves to block his nomination at the Republican National Convention in July if he falls short of the threshold of 1, 237 delegates that would guarantee him the party\u2019s candidacy.",
        "Microphone in hand, Republican John Kasich promised the crowd inside a Ohio factory Saturday that he\u2019ll never be beholden to Washington insiders if he wins the White House in November.

        "The U. S. subway system, which serves Washington D. C. will close for 29 hours at midnight EDT (0400 GMT) on Tuesday for emergency safety checks, leaving hundreds of thousands of government workers, tourists and business travelers struggling to get around town.

        "The S&P 500 closed at its highest in 2016, leading global stock gains, while the U. S. dollar weakened after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady while lowering expectations for the number of rate hikes this year. The Fed noted that the U.

        "U. S. retail sales fell less than expected in February, but a sharp downward revision to January\u2019s data could reignite concerns about the economy\u2019s growth prospects. Tuesday\u2019s weak report from the Commerce Department bucked the trend of recent labor market data that had suggested the economy remained on solid ground despite some fears of a looming recession. The data could give the Federal Reserve more reason to keep interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, when it is due to release its latest policy statement. \u201dThe economy\u2019s engines are not going into reverse . ..",

S. export restrictions imposed last week, according to a person familiar with the matter, after the telecom equipment maker\u2019s costly lobbying effort failed to allay concerns about its business.

        "The dollar fell sharply on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged, but reduced its expectations for interest rate hikes in 2016 to two from four.

        "Russian warplanes flew home from Syria on Tuesday as Moscow started to withdraw forces that have tipped the war President Bashar \u2019s way, and the U. N. envoy said he hoped the move would help peace talks in Geneva. As the first aircraft touched down in Russia, U. N. envoy Staffan de Mistura called President Vladimir Putin\u2019s surprise move a \u201dsignificant development\u201d toward resolving a conflict which this week passes its fifth anniversary.

        "Members of a U. S. Senate panel and firms working on vehicles on Tuesday called for national rather than state regulation of the cars to avoid a patchwork of rules that could slow development. Major automakers and technology companies are racing to develop and sell vehicles that can drive themselves but have complained that state and federal safety rules are impeding testing and ultimate deployment. The rules will determine when and if a fully autonomous car could be driven on roads. Differing rules from state to state would prevent the cars being driven over state lines.",

        "U. S. Senator Marco Rubio suspended his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination on Tuesday, having lost his home state of Florida despite support from a party establishment worried about the rise of billionaire Donald Trump. \u201dWhile this may not have been the year for a hopeful and optimistic message about our future, I still remain hopeful and optimistic about America,\u201d Rubio, 44, told supporters in Miami after his projected loss to Trump.

        "The United States unveiled new measures on Tuesday to make it far easier for Americans to visit Cuba and eased limits on the use of U. S dollars in trade there as President Barack Obama prepared to make a historic trip to Havana next week. Rolling out some of the most significant changes since Obama announced his opening to Cuba in December 2014, U.

        "Vladimir Putin cited Russian military success in Syria as his reason for scaling back his forces there. But his belief that the intervention delivered him a seat at the top table of world affairs is more likely to have tipped his hand. Russia\u2019s Syria operation, launched on Sept. 30 last year, made military, diplomatic and domestic political sense for the Kremlin which was keen to shore up its closest Middle East ally and protect its only naval facility on the Mediterranean. It has largely achieved both aims."
