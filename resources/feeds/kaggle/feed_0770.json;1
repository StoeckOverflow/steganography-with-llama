        "The wildfire that swept through the Canadian city of Fort McMurray blazed a capricious trail. Swathes of homes were burned to the ground while nearby areas were unscathed and dotted with blooming lilacs, a tour showed on Monday. In Beacon Hill, one of the neighborhoods of a city that booms and busts with the price of oil, houses on street after street were reduced to nothing more than blackened foundations and front steps. Metal barbecues stood outside some. Cars and trucks sat in some driveways on melted tires, streams of metal snaked from underneath. \u201dThis was a beast.",
        "Tiny bubbles that formed inside volcanic rock 2. 7 billion years ago are providing big insights into the conditions on primordial Earth. Scientists said an analysis of gas bubbles trapped in ancient basalt rock that formed from ancient lava flows in western Australia showed the planet back then possessed a much thinner atmosphere, with air pressure half of what it is today. That finding contradicts a notion that Earth then had a thicker atmosphere to compensate for a fainter sun, with sunlight about 15 percent dimmer. The sun is slowly brightening over time, part of a star\u2019s natural evolution.",

The new complaint, filed by Manuela Herzer, 52, in Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday, alleges that Redstone\u2019s daughter Shari interfered with the inheritance Herzer was due to receive in his will and invaded her privacy.
