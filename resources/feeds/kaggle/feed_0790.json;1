S. presidential hopeful Donald Trump on Saturday presented his vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, as the man who can unify a fractured Republican party and help him bridge the gap created by the candidate\u2019s outsider status.

        "Twitter Inc moved swiftly to remove posts from Islamic extremists glorifying a truck attack in Nice, France, watchdog groups said on Friday, in a rare round of praise for a platform that has often struggled to contain violent propaganda. A spate of violence over the past several months has posed numerous challenges to social media companies. Friday\u2019s unsuccessful military coup in Turkey was marked first by restrictions on social media, internet monitoring groups said, but the crackdown appeared to ease as the events unfolded and numerous citizens broadcast live video on Facebook and sent tweets.

S. serviceman espousing militant black nationalist views killed five Dallas officers.",
        "Tensions in Louisiana\u2019s state capital go back years. For many residents, the police force has been viewed as overly aggressive and unrepresentative of a city where over half the 230, 000 residents are black and where racial problems date back decades. Minorities are \u201dvery wary of police and often afraid of them,\u201d says Michele Fournet, a veteran Baton Rouge criminal defense lawyer.

Congress extolling democracy and investment opportunities in the subcontinent.

        "European Union foreign ministers urged Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Monday to respect the law and human rights in dealing with defeated coup plotters, warning that reinstating the death penalty would likely end Ankara\u2019s EU membership bid.

The Turkish leader was returning to Istanbul from a holiday near the coastal resort of Marmaris after a faction in the military launched the coup attempt on Friday night, sealing off a bridge across the Bosphorus, trying to capture Istanbul\u2019s main airport and sending tanks to parliament in Ankara. \u201dAt least two harassed Erdogan\u2019s plane while it was in the air and en route to Istanbul.",
        "Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan pledged to overhaul the army in response to last week\u2019s failed coup, a sign that a newly imposed state of emergency would be used to press on with a purge that has alarmed the West.

        "Japan\u2019s aging population may be bad for the economy but it is giving dealmakers a break. As more owners of small and businesses reach their golden years without grooming a successor, some are turning to private equity firms for capital and management expertise. The number of older owners has been rising, and a low birth rate means that there are often precious few heirs to take over from them.",
        "The failure of Turkey\u2019s latest attempted coup will be complete when we see President Tayyip Erdogan return to his daily duties in Ankara. Why did he first fly to Istanbul rather than his country\u2019s capital? Because it contains the largest group of his 60 per cent of the city\u2019s 14 million people. And they came through for him. It is also the base of Turkey\u2019s powerful First Army. Note that its commanding officer was appointed acting chief of staff when the present incumbent was temporarily captured by the coup supporters. Erdogan clearly thinks this army is loyal.",
