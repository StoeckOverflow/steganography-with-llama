        "Afghan authorities are investigating why Taliban militants were able to push past checkpoints in the central city of Tarin Kot with such ease during a recent attack that exposed the fragile defenses of many remote regions. The Sept. 8 raid on the capital of Uruzgan province briefly sparked fears of a collapse like that in the northern city of Kunduz last year, a short yet symbolic victory for an Islamist insurgency that shows few signs of weakening. The Tarin Kot advance was eventually repelled when reinforcements, backed by U. S.",
        "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) Millions of girls are left \u201dinvisible\u201d because of a lack of data, a children\u2019s charity said on Monday, and the absence of accurate statistics on issues such as sexual violence means policymakers cannot draw up effective plans to help them. There is no data that fully captures the daily realities of girls in poor communities, Plan International said in a report, including why girls drop out of school or how many become pregnant because of sexual violence.",
        "The U. S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to rehear a bid to revive President Barack Obama\u2019s plan to spare from deportation millions of immigrants in the country illegally, a case in which the justices split in June. In a brief order, the court rejected the Obama administration\u2019s request, meaning the justices\u2019 June 23 decision is final. That ruling left in place lower court decisions blocking the plan, which Obama announced in 2014 but never went into effect. The high court remains one justice short following Antonin Scalia\u2019s February death.",

        "Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday suspended a treaty with Washington on cleaning up plutonium, signaling he is willing to use nuclear disarmament as a new bargaining chip in disputes with the United States over Ukraine and Syria. Starting in the last years of the Cold War, Russia and the United States signed a series of accords to reduce the size of their nuclear arsenals, agreements that have so far survived intact despite a souring of U. S. relations under Putin.",

        "It was always very personal. Since stepping down as president six years ago, Alvaro Uribe has relentlessly condemned the policies of his handpicked and chiseled away at support for his biggest goal: ending the war with Marxist rebels. On Sunday, the hardline senator scored his biggest victory yet against President Juan Manuel Santos, turning what seemed like certain victory for a peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, into a massive blow to the government. Colombians\u2019 narrow rejection of the peace accord in a referendum shocked the world.",
        "Colombia\u2019s government and Marxist guerrillas scrambled on Monday to revive a plan to end their war after voters rejected the deal as too lenient on the rebels in a shock referendum result that plunged the nation into uncertainty. Any renegotiated peace accord now seems to depend on whether the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) could accept tougher sanctions against them. \u201dNo\u201d voters, who narrowly won Sunday\u2019s plebiscite, want assurances the rebels will hand in cash from drugs, spend time in jail, and earn their political future at the ballot box rather than get guaranteed, unelected seats in Congress.",

        "Indiana Governor Mike Pence, the Republican nominee for U. S. vice president, lost another round in federal court on Monday in his bid to keep refugees fleeing Syria\u2019s civil war from resettling in his state. The 7th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago affirmed a ruling that Pence\u2019s order seeking to bar state agencies from helping the resettlement of Syrian immigrants discriminates against the refugees based on their national origin.
