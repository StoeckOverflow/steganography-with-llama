        "For India\u2019s dream of taking the baton of global growth from China, its savings rate is flashing a warning sign. Gross national savings as a percent of the South Asian nation\u2019s gross domestic product will slip this year to 30. 2 percent, the lowest since 2003, and fall further over the next two years, the International Monetary Fund forecasts.
