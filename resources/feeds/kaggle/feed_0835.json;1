        "Federal officials have warned authorities in New York City, Texas and Virginia about an unspecific threat of attacks by al Qaeda militants around Election Day, putting local law enforcement on alert days before the vote, officials said on Friday.

        "Billionaire investor William Ackman and Chipotle Mexican Grill ( ) have signed an agreement to engage in confidential discussions, a source familiar with the matter said, in a sign that the activist may be able to force change at the burrito chain without a costly and proxy contest.

        "New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is unlikely to face criminal prosecution for the \u201dBridgegate\u201d lane closure scandal, even after two of his former associates were convicted for their roles in the scheme on Friday. U. S. prosecutors have essentially conceded that charges are not forthcoming against the Republican, even though a key government witness testified that Christie was aware of the scheme as it unfolded in September 2013. State charges are also a long shot, legal experts said. The state assembly might explore impeaching Christie, though that is no sure thing.",
        "U. S. employers maintained a strong pace of hiring in October and boosted wages for workers, which could effectively seal the case for a December interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve.

The closely watched employment report was published four days before the Nov. 8 presidential election. The solid labor market fundamentals were also underscored by revisions to August and September data, which showed 44, 000 more jobs created than previously reported.",
        "Old disputes between Saudi Arabia and rival Iran resurfaced at a meeting of OPEC experts last week, with Riyadh saying it could raise oil output steeply to bring prices down if Tehran refuses to limit its supply, OPEC sources say. Clashes between the two OPEC heavyweights, which are fighting proxy wars in Syria and Yemen, have become frequent in recent years. Tensions subsided, however, in recent months after Saudi Arabia agreed to support a global oil supply limiting pact, thus raising the prospect that OPEC would take steps to boost oil prices.",
        "Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim said on Friday that Donald Trump\u2019s plans would \u201ddestroy\u201d the United States economy and joked that the Republican presidential candidate\u2019s proposed wall at the border would be undermined by smuggling tunnels. Slim made his first public comments since Trump accused him of trying to help the candidate\u2019s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, in the U. S. election at an event in Mexico City. Slim said that he thought it was unlikely Trump would win the election on Tuesday, and dismissed the New York businessman\u2019s economic proposals.",

        "Two former associates of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie were convicted on Friday for their roles in the \u201dBridgegate\u201d lane closure scandal, following a trial that served to further tarnish the Republican\u2019s damaged reputation. Bridget Kelly, the governor\u2019s former deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, were found guilty in Newark federal court on all counts.

S. airline industry has consolidated, with carriers operating more efficient itineraries and having more power to raise fares on some routes.",

        "Californians are expected to pass a ballot measure on Election Day legalizing recreational marijuana, and the prospect has cities and counties seeing dollar signs. Proposition 64 would impose state taxes on the cultivation and sale of marijuana. But it also allows local jurisdictions to add taxes of their own, something many cities and counties said they plan to do.

Invoking the demand of \u201dno taxation without representation,\u201d supporters say becoming a state would end Washingtonians\u2019 status as citizens because they lack representation in Congress. But opponents dismiss the referendum as a \u201dfool\u2019s errand\u201d destined to fail because of partisan political hurdles and the need to amend the U. S.

S. border, Alicia Villa is praying to God that Republican candidate Donald Trump does not become the next president of the United States.

        "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump won a legal battle on Sunday when a U. S. appeals court in Ohio removed new restrictions on partisan poll watchers that Democrats had sought to prevent Election Day voter intimidation.
