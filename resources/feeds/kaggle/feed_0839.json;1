        "Republican Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to shake up Washington and as president the brash real estate mogul will be in a position to dramatically change how the United States handles immigration, trade and a range of other policies. Yet many of his more ambitious proposals will require cooperation from Congress. While he will likely enjoy a honeymoon with congressional Republicans, a romance is far from guaranteed, given his uneasy relationship with congressional leaders and some basic ideological differences he has with Republican orthodoxy.",
        "Republican Donald Trump fared better with parts of U. S. society than expected, and Democrat Hillary Clinton did worse, to produce a U. S. presidential election outcome that defied opinion polls forecasting a Clinton victory. Early readings from a national Election Day opinion poll help explain how the New York real estate magnate eked out his advantage in Tuesday\u2019s vote. The Election Day poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It included more than 45, 000 people who voted in the presidential election.",
        "Americans in liberal enclaves from New York to San Francisco reacted with shock and despair on Wednesday to Republican businessman Donald Trump\u2019s defeat of Democrat Hillary Clinton, with many struggling to explain the result to their children. Trump, who had never before run for public office, won on a broad wave of support both from the Republican U. S. heartland and by flipping previously Democratic states, including Pennsylvania, Florida and Ohio, helping his party protect majorities in both chambers of Congress.",
        "Voters in four states raised minimum wages on Tuesday even as Republicans who oppose such increases won nationally, indicating that workers may still be able to improve compensation at the expense of restaurants, retailers and other employers. Pay hikes appeal to voters who lifted Republican Donald Trump to a decisive win in the U. S. presidential race, and also to liberals who voted for Hillary Clinton, worker advocates said. \u201dThis could be a uniting issue,\u201d said Saru Jayaraman, of the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United and director of the Food Labor Research Center at University of California, Berkeley.",
        "Jay Y. Lee, de facto head of South Korea\u2019s sprawling Samsung Group, accelerated taking a board seat at flagship unit Samsung Electronics ( ) partly because of investor pressure to improve governance, two people familiar with the matter said. Samsung Group narrowly survived a bid by U. S. activist hedge fund Elliott Management last year to block a controversial merger of two group businesses, Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries. The deal sparked criticism that the Lee family put its interests ahead of those of shareholders. In its latest campaign, Elliott, which owns 0.",
        "Shares fell for U. S. automakers and suppliers, which rely heavily on production in Mexico to feed their U. S. manufacturing and sales operations. General Motors Co ( ) shares dropped as much as 4 percent on Wednesday before recovering some of that decline in the late afternoon. The automaker said on Wednesday it was laying off 2, 000 people and cutting a shift at a Lordstown, Ohio, factory that builds Chevrolet Cruze small cars and at a Lansing, Michigan, plant that builds Cadillac sedans and Chevrolet Camaro sports cars.

        "Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital, said U. S. stock markets rebounded strongly from overnight losses because investors believe U. S. Donald Trump\u2019s policies are better for economic growth in the than Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s would have been. Gundlach, known on Wall Street as the \u2019Bond King\u2019 told Reuters by telephone: \u201dMany foreigners wanted Trump to lose, so you saw huge selling overnight. But U. S.",
        "(Reuters Breakingviews) Donald Trump has been parsimonious with details about his plans. He talked broadly about fixing roads and bridges, enforcing borders and security, chilling out on regulation and retaliating against those who don\u2019t share his vision. Mr. Market is filling in the blanks. U. S. equities started mostly flat on Wednesday, but specific enterprises were targeted to benefit from the new Republican leader, while perceived losers were punished. Many of these ideas showed up in the Breakingviews Trump Victory Portfolio in September (See graphic ).",

        "(This November 9th story has been refiled to clarify that Keyes comment in 3rd paragraph from end was said in jest) By Andy Sullivan and Michelle Conlin In a bitterly divisive presidential election, at least one thing united U. S. voters: a feeling that the country\u2019s economic and political systems were tilted against them. A Election Day poll of 45, 000 voters found an electorate burning with resentment against Wall Street, politicians and the news media, increasingly alienated from a country that is changing in ways it doesn\u2019t like.",
        "Global stock markets experienced a bit of shock (without the awe) after Republican Donald Trump upset the establishment to win the White House. Renewable energy stocks, including solar and wind power companies, took a beating on Wednesday morning as investors presumably expect a Trump presidency will be bad for those businesses. But oil and gas companies may be poised to hitch a ride on the \u2019s coattails, if his energy plan succeeds. Trump\u2019s policy proposals include opening onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands, eliminating renewable energy subsidies and removing the U. S.",
        "For all their mutual praise, Russian President Vladimir Putin and U. S. Donald Trump are likely to disagree on many things. But Trump\u2019s election win could hand Moscow an elusive prize the lifting or easing of Western sanctions. Rolling back those sanctions, imposed by the United States and the European Union to punish Moscow for its 2014 annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, could spur investment in Russia\u2019s economy.",

        "So now we know. Sometime after the presidential inauguration on January 20, America\u2019s new will take his seat in the Oval Office for the first time. Donald Trump will sit back, survey the room where so much history has taken place and then, somehow, make his mark on the world.

        "A rally in major world stock markets lost some steam on Thursday despite a continued surge in bank shares, as investors reassessed positions, while U. S. bond yields continued to climb on the likelihood of inflation under Donald Trump\u2019s proposed fiscal policy. Investors after the election quickly shifted to focus on Trump\u2019s priorities, including tax cuts, an increase in defense and infrastructure spending, and bank deregulation. The expansionary policy is expected to lead to inflation. After a strong start, stocks in Europe reversed course and turned negative. Europe\u2019s index of leading 300 shares was down 0.",
        "World leaders offered to work with Donald Trump when he takes over as U. S. president, but expressed anxiety over how he will handle problems from the Middle East to an assertive Russia and whether he will carry out a number of campaign threats.

        "NATO promised on Wednesday to defend all allies despite election victor Donald Trump\u2019s call to set conditions for U. S. help, as the alliance braced for a more impulsive leader some fear could withdraw funding to deter Russia. During the presidential election campaign Trump threatened to abandon U.

        "Germany\u2019s mighty automakers wasted little time on Wednesday in voicing concern that Donald Trump\u2019s election as U.

        "Hillary Clinton walked onto the ballroom stage Wednesday morning to do what many had considered unthinkable: thank her campaign staff after failing in her bid to become the first woman elected U. S. president, instead of the anticipated victory speech under a symbolic glass ceiling. Hundreds of staffers and supporters gathered at the New Yorker Hotel in midtown Manhattan to hear Clinton speak publicly for the first time after her bruising loss to New York real estate magnate Donald Trump in the early hours of the morning.",
        "Donald Trump will have an early Capitol Hill honeymoon with Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress when he takes office in January, but a romance may be more challenging. A president whose party controls both the Senate and House of Representatives can generally count on getting things done fairly quickly, and Trump likely will not be an exception, despite starting with unusual handicaps. Many Republicans in Congress only backed Trump after he became the candidate. Some never fell in line.",
        "Some Republican foreign policy veterans who came out against Donald Trump during the presidential campaign said on Wednesday they were sticking to their guns following his election victory, but a few others signaled that objections to serving in his new administration were softening. Trump\u2019s stunning upset over Democrat Hillary Clinton has created a new dilemma for the Republican national security establishment, much of which had publicly distanced itself from their own party\u2019s candidate, declaring him unfit to lead. They must now decide whether to return to the fold.",

        "U. S. corporate dealmakers were likely to put major merger plans on hold as they assess whether U. S. Donald Trump will follow through on his populist promises and a threat to block AT&T Inc\u2019s ( ) purchase of Time Warner Inc ( ) or act more like traditional Republican administrations. Trump\u2019s rhetoric and the personal nature of the campaign, which included little discussion of policy, left many uncertain about the new U.

        "U. S. President Barack Obama\u2019s foreign policy legacy rests in part on a foundation of unilateral actions that his successor Donald Trump could reverse with the stroke of a pen. Due to take office on Jan. 20, Trump, the winner in Tuesday\u2019s election, campaigned at times to dismantle Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran and to reimpose sanctions Obama eased on Cuba.

McAndrew, 69, a retired steel worker, voted Democrat in every presidential election for half a century. This year he stayed home. And Northampton County, a heavily white, heavily Democratic, largely working class area that backed President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, went for Donald Trump, a Republican.",
