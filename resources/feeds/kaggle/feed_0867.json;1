        "People have dreamed about flying cars for decades, but the technology has always seemed far out of reach. Airplanes have long been too big, expensive, dangerous, loud, and complex for personal aviation to be more than a hobby for rich people. But that might be about to change. \u201cThere\u2019s a couple of technologies that are maturing and converging\u201d to make small, affordable airplanes feasible, says Brian German, an aerospace researcher at Georgia Tech.",
        "US intelligence agencies believe that this year Russia mounted an unprecedented attack on the integrity of the American electoral process in an effort to undermine American democracy and ensure the election of Donald Trump. On Thursday, the Obama administration announced an equally unprecedented effort to punish Moscow with sanctions for its past hacking \u2014 and serve notice that future meddling will draw an even harsher response.",
        "Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison hadn\u2019t been campaigning for chair of the Democratic National Committee for more than a week before veteran party officials began publicly saying he wouldn\u2019t have time to both hold the position and serve as a congressman. Ellison then announced that he\u2019d step down from congress if he won the DNC race. But almost as soon as he did so, a new chorus of objections to his candidacy began: top Democratic sources told reporters they were growing concerned about Ellison\u2019s alleged ties to the Nation of Islam and radical black Muslim organizers in the 1990s.",
        "One of the biggest and most important science stories of 2016 will probably also be one of the biggest science stories of the next decade. So this is as good a time as any to get acquainted with the powerful new technology known as CRISPR. If you haven\u2019t heard of CRISPR yet, the short explanation goes like this: In the past four years, scientists have figured out how to exploit a quirk in the immune systems of bacteria to edit genes in other organisms \u2014 plant genes, mouse genes, even human genes.",
        "I gave up drinking when my pancreas exploded. In early 2014, after celebrating a job loss with a bender, I spent a sunny Sunday with a knifing pain in my gut, vomiting so hard that I ripped my gastrointestinal tract. My mom gave me a ride to the emergency room, and I spent a week in the hospital. A doctor told me that if I kept drinking, I would die. And I had to think about it for a second. If you\u2019re not blacked out, is life worth remembering?",
        "Visit any Ikea, and you\u2019ll see hordes of milling through a vast maze of bed frames, bookshelves, tables, and lamps. More than 771 million people visit the home furnishing company\u2019s 375 retail locations (40 of which are in the US) each year. Collectively, these stores generate an annual revenue of $34. 5 billion USD and use 530 million cubic feet of wood to manufacture their offerings. A supposed ease of construction, modern design, and relative affordability have made Ikea a furniture mecca for young college grads.",
        "In retrospect, David Bowie returning to the stardust from whence he came on January 10, 2016 was some horrific foreshadowing for the year of celebrity deaths to come. Yes, people die every year, and sometimes their deaths are sudden and arbitrary. And no, 2016 may not categorically be \u201cthe worst,\u201d no matter how many despairing memes claim otherwise.",
        "When Secretary of State John Kerry described Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government as \u201cthe most in Israeli history,\u201d he wasn\u2019t just taking a pot shot at a foreign leader the Obama administration has come to loathe. The top US diplomat was instead making an accurate assessment of an important, and dangerous, shift in Israel\u2019s domestic politics. With the country\u2019s left wing hobbled by electoral losses and bitter infighting, Netanyahu believes his biggest political threat comes from the right, not the left.",
        "The United Nations resolution condemning Israeli settlements that passed last week does not impose any kind of financial sanctions or other punitive measures on Israel. What it does do, though, is essentially give the green light to activist groups and countries to accelerate campaigns aimed at striking Israel\u2019s economic interests and weakening its international reputation. And that could potentially prove to be just as damaging. In the past few years, movements like \u201cboycott, divestment, and sanctions\u201d (BDS) a campaign modeled off the economic activism that helped end apartheid in South Africa, have begun to gain traction in the West.",
        "A controversial new United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory has triggered a brutal and messy diplomatic fight between President Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and now Donald Trump. The war of words got even nastier Wednesday, when Secretary of State John Kerry delivered a speech warning that Netanyahu\u2019s settlement policy could doom any chance at a peace deal and threaten Israel\u2019s future as a Jewish and democratic state. \u201cThe status quo is leading toward one state and perpetual occupation,\u201d Kerry warned.",
        "Hope everyone enjoyed 2016, because this year is going to last one second longer than usual. No, really: On December 31, New Year\u2019s Eve, the world\u2019s timekeepers will add in a \u201cleap second\u201d to keep all our clocks in sync with the Earth\u2019s rotation. They do this because the Earth technically takes a bit longer than 24 hours to complete a full rotation (86, 400. 002 seconds, to be exact). So a leap second gets added every few years.",
        "The 2016 campaign trail was a long and rocky, but for members of the \u2014 the noxious, movement built on a foundation of white nationalism \u2014 it was a turbulent ride to an unexpected victory. Amid the group\u2019s triumphant reveling in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s win, the following image circulated online: The poster combines several memes, and though it\u2019s undoubtedly \u2014 the \u2019s rhetoric deliberately straddles a murky line between ironic hyperbole and sincere conspiratorial belief \u2014 it actually contains a lot of insight about Trump\u2019s journey to the White House.",
        "One of Donald Trump\u2019s major themes on the 2016 campaign trail was the need to improve the health care offerings afforded to America\u2019s veterans. We\u2019re going to \u201ctake care of our veterans like they have never been taken care of before\u201d was a fairly typical stump speech line, though he sometimes shortened it to simply a brief promise to \u201ctake care of our vets. \u201d This was typically laced with references to the spring 2014 VA scandal and devoid of references to the bipartisan reform legislation that passed in the wake of the scandal.",
        "According to Todd Fisher \u2014 son of the actress Debbie Reynolds, who died yesterday at age 84 after suffering a stroke \u2014 his mother died of a broken heart. The death of Reynolds\u2019s daughter and Todd\u2019s sister, Carrie Fisher, of a heart attack Tuesday \u201cwas too much,\u201d he told reporters. \u201dShe was under a lot of emotion and stress from the loss [of Carrie] and it\u2019s pretty much what triggered this event,\u201d he told E News. We\u2019re not going to speculate about whether Reynolds\u2019s death was a direct result of her daughter\u2019s death. We haven\u2019t spoken with her doctor.",
        "Early in \u201cThe Jacket,\u201d the finale of FX\u2019s terrific new comedy Atlanta, protagonist Earn (Donald Glover) leaves the apartment he unexpectedly woke up in after a wild time the night before. As he strolls down the sidewalk, blinking blearily in the sun, he\u2019s suddenly passed by several people in cow costumes. It\u2019s free chicken sandwich day, one of them proclaims, but Earn seems as if he could not be less fazed by the sight of people in cow costumes interrupting his morning.",
        "With the country in the middle of an essentially unprecedented political crisis, there\u2019s a kind of eerie normalcy to the speech on Israel and Palestine that John Kerry delivered Wednesday afternoon. The remarks themselves were unusually harsh, as was the United Nations resolution on Israeli settlements last week that the administration allowed through. But US presidents and secretaries of state have been talking about the issue for literally decades without much changing. Related 9 questions about the UN vote on Israeli settlements you were too embarrassed to ask Nothing seems in the offing here, either.",
        "I\u2019ve been trying to process my feelings about the cultural outpourings of grief that have become a terribly common part of 2016 \u2014 specifically those surrounding the Christmas Day death of George Michael. I am a culture nerd who is forever playing with pop culture; there are a lot of cultural icons whose worth I recognize intellectually rather than emotionally because they never happened to me. Prince, David Bowie, Carrie Fisher \u2014 these are losses I felt on a cultural level rather than an individual one.",
        "The Congressional Budget Office has stepped into the Obamacare repeal fight, issuing a fierce warning to Republicans in the form of \u2026 a sternly worded blog post. CBO is the government\u2019s nonpartisan scorekeeper, the agency that tells Congress how much new programs cost and who they\u2019ll cover. Their analysts will estimate how many people get insurance under any Republican replacement plan. And CBO, in its new blog post, says it won\u2019t let Republicans count especially skimpy coverage as health insurance.",
        "You\u2019re walking to work when you see a man tailing a woman, muttering sexual obscenities at her as she stares straight ahead, picking up her pace. You\u2019re on the train when someone shouts across the aisle, calling a Muslim family \u201cterrorists. \u201d You\u2019re shopping when you see an employee following a black teenager with a backpack, waiting for him to swipe something. At first, you look for some other brave witness to intervene, calling out the discriminatory or scary acts to try to put an end to them.",
        "There\u2019s no shortage of misinformation in the world \u2014 particularly around health and science topics. Sometimes that\u2019s just because the research can be a little contradictory (nutrition, for instance, is famously hard to study). Sometimes that\u2019s because there are quacks or vested interests trying to spread lies and pseudoscience. And sometimes there are just weird myths that have randomly taken hold and refuse to go away (like the idea that you need to drink eight glasses of water a day \u2014 you don\u2019t). Alas, it\u2019s unlikely that the world\u2019s ever going to be completely free of nonsense.",
        "Today, New York City is celebrating the opening of the first phase of the Second Avenue Subway, a project that\u2019s been anticipated for nearly a century and that\u2019s sorely needed to relieve overcrowding on the Lexington Avenue lines and to extend access to some very densely populated neighborhoods. But as exciting as the opening is, phase one is also a very project encompassing just three stations. The plan is, eventually, to extend it up into East Harlem, and potentially then either go farther south or swing west to provide crosstown subway service across 125th Street.",
        "What happened to the US in 2016 is historical and terrifying, and most of us were unprepared for it. This year saw the rise to power of a vocal, extremism with white supremacist and fascist leanings not considered a legitimate part of American politics in over half a century, while the ideological differences between the left and right splintered so far that it seems to have fractured reality itself. That\u2019s not hyperbole. In 2016, it became difficult even to achieve consensus about what\u2019s actually real. These reality distortions took hold deeply in 2016.",
        "All art is political, but science fiction is perhaps the most conscientiously political genre in all of fiction. So it\u2019s been odd to witness the surrounding the recent Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which has centered on discussions of whether the original Star Wars trilogy was intentionally political, or whether its latest incarnation has somehow muddied waters.",
        "Ah, January, when the weather throughout most of the country gets unbearable and the number of enticing options at the local cineplex takes a nose dive. What better time to hole up inside and stream a bunch of movies and TV shows?",
        "The last week of 2016 has been unexpectedly momentous for \u2014 and \u2014 relations. First, the Obama administration decided to abstain on a United Nations Security Council vote on a resolution condemning Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory. The international community has long considered the building of Israeli settlements on Palestinian land both illegal under international law and an impediment to the eventual creation of a Palestinian state. The US\u2019s refusal to veto allowed the resolution to pass, rebuking Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s policies and infuriating him and his office.",
        "Over the past several years, Jack Gallant\u2019s neuroscience lab has produced a string of papers that sound absurd. In 2011, the lab showed it was possible to recreate movie clips just from observing the brain activity of people watching movies. Using a computer to regenerate the images of a film just by scanning the brain of a person watching one is, in a sense, mind reading. Similarly, in 2015, Gallant\u2019s team of scientists predicted which famous paintings people were picturing in their minds by observing the activity of their brains.",
        "A few things are curiously missing from the Mitch McConnell \u2014 Elaine Chao Archives at the University of Louisville. At an exhibit designed to celebrate the Senate majority leader and his wife, there\u2019s almost no mention of any bills McConnell has authored in his 32 years in the Senate. There\u2019s virtually nothing about the people he\u2019s helped, nothing to highlight courageous speeches made on the Senate floor.",
        "Donald Trump is a divisive figure, but does writing his name in chalk on a university sidewalk amount to the harassment of minority students? Some students at Emory University claimed as much last spring, when the \u2019s name, along with phrases like \u201dBuild a Wall,\u201d appeared near the buildings where many student groups had their headquarters. The messages were a \u201ddirect threat to their safety,\u201d the students contended. Asked by some to defend the First Amendment and by others to side with the aggrieved students, Emory\u2019s president came down squarely in the middle.",
        "Donald Trump is continuing to show signs that he\u2019s serious about transforming the way America does business in the global arena: On Tuesday, he picked Robert Lighthizer, a former trade official in the Reagan administration and longtime skeptic of free trade, to head the US Trade Representative office. The USTR takes the lead responsibility for negotiating trade agreements with other countries and represents the United States at the World Trade Organization.",
        "Less than 24 hours after House Republicans met behind closed doors and held an anonymous vote to bring the Office of Congressional Ethics under the thumb of the House Ethics Committee, they backed down \u2014 stripping the changes to the office out of the package of House rules that the chamber will vote on later Tuesday. The reversal is already being hailed as a victory for democratic accountability. Critics of House Republicans are reassured that even in the era of Donald Trump, there are some things the government can\u2019t get away with . Public pressure works. #Ethics: SAVED."
