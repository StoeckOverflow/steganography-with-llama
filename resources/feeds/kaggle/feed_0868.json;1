        "The new Congress was sworn in on Tuesday, and the first thing it did was prepare to repeal Obamacare. Senate Budget Committee Chair Michael Enzi ( ) introduced a budget resolution Tuesday that includes \u201dreconciliation instructions\u201d that enable Congress to repeal Obamacare with a simple Senate majority. Passing a budget resolution that includes those instructions will mean that the legislation can pass through the budget reconciliation process, in which bills cannot be filibustered.",
        "NAACP protesters prepared for the worst: Either Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions withdrew from consideration as Donald Trump\u2019s attorney general nominee or they\u2019d risk arrest during a at Sessions\u2019s Mobile, Alabama, office. NAACP president Cornell William Brooks announced the on Tuesday. And seven hours later, the NAACP protesters were arrested when they refused to leave Sessions\u2019s office. NAACP against Sen.

        "Milo Yiannopoulos \u2014 a leader of the racist, misogynist fringe movement known as the who built his career on being hateful to people on the internet and has been described as a professional troll and the leader of an online hate mob \u2014 recently signed a book deal with Simon & Schuster imprint Threshold Editions for a reported $250, 000 advance, says the Hollywood Reporter. The response from progressives was immediate and outraged.",
        "Derek Parfit, who died at age 74 on Sunday evening, was not the most famous philosopher in the world. But he was among the most brilliant, and his papers and books have had a profound, incalculably vast impact on the study of moral philosophy over the past half century. His work did not dwell on topics of merely academic interest. He wrote about big topics that trouble everyone, philosopher and layperson alike: Who am I? What makes me \u201cme\u201d? What separates me from other people? How should I weigh my desires against those of others?",
        "The annual New Year\u2019s Eve party at Donald Trump\u2019s resort in Florida was a festival of ostentatious excess. Celebrities and the wealthy sipped on champagne with their caviar and foie gras. But the hundreds of people who bought a ticket to the event enjoyed something even more elite: access to Donald Trump, who profited personally from their $500 entry fee. Trump showed up to the event and gave a brief speech to club members, according to the New York Times.",
        "On Tuesday morning, the news of the day was that House Republicans had voted to gut the independent office that oversaw their ethics, behind closed doors and without any public debate. The news did not go over well \u2014 stories about the move went viral on social media, and a chorus of condemnations rained in from all sides. At first the \u2019s team didn\u2019t seem particularly disturbed by this news.",
        "If you\u2019re like the vast majority of culture fans, you probably still have plenty of 2016 pop culture left to check out. But look sharp \u2014 2017 is here, and it\u2019s bringing everything from a sequel to one of the biggest movies of all time to a TV adaptation of Margaret Atwood\u2019s classic novel The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. Here are 23 projects slated for this year that we can\u2019t help but look forward to. Note: Release dates could shift, so don\u2019t take them as gospel.",
        "Late in the evening on a federal holiday, behind closed doors and with no public record of how members of Congress voted, House Republicans voted to advance a proposal to eviscerate the independent watchdog overseeing their ethics. Then \u2014 after a public outcry and two critical tweets from Donald Trump \u2014 they reversed course. At least for now, the Office of Congressional Ethics will live another day. But House Republicans still plan to tackle the matter through a bipartisan report later in the year.",
        "John Ziegler hosts a Los nationally syndicated radio talk show. Or at least he did until a couple of weeks ago. On Sunday, December 19, he called it quits. And he did it because of Donald Trump. A lifelong conservative, Ziegler opposed Trump from the beginning of the 2016 presidential campaign, and he paid a steep price for that opposition. Conservatives \u2014 or the kinds of conservatives who listen to talk radio \u2014 weren\u2019t interested in contrarianism. They wanted affirmation, not information; loyalty, not principled disagreement. Ziegler\u2019s honesty was not rewarded.",
        "When 2009 began, the Republican Party looked like a smoking pile of rubble. The GOP had lost the presidency, and much of its outgoing president\u2019s legacy seemed set to be reversed. Republicans had fallen into the minority in both houses of Congress. And in the states, they held less than half of governorships and only about a quarter of state legislatures. The party has since, of course, made a remarkable comeback. But that comeback didn\u2019t unfold entirely in 2016.",
        "Tom and I broke up a few weeks before he was due to start medical school. Our relationship had been a whirlwind. We had known each other since childhood but had been dating for just 10 days before he moved down from Connecticut to Pennsylvania and into my small apartment. A few months later, we were planning our wedding, deliberating what guest favors we would choose (DIY terrariums were under consideration) and stopping in at jewelers to try on engagement rings. I was elated, effervescent, convinced he was \u201cthe one.",
        "We\u2019re about to enter a golden age of genetic engineering, where huge advances in technology are making it possible for scientists to tweak the DNA of different organisms with incredible, unprecedented precision. Until just a few years ago, altering individual genes in everything from plant cells to mouse cells to human cells was a crude, laborious, and often futile process. Now scientists have developed a technology called (or CRISPR for short) which harnesses the immune system of bacteria to snip individual genes, either knocking them out or even inserting new ones in their place.",
        "Few things knock your emotional world off its axis like a breakup. When my first relationship ended, I woke up for several days in a row not quite remembering that my ex and I had split. This lapse would only last one or two seconds, but each time the reality hit, I switched from my usual cozy contentment to cold, sickening shock all over again. And I was far from alone in how I reacted to my split. Breakups aren\u2019t just unpleasant; for young adults, they are one of the most common risk factors for clinical depression.",
        "On Monday, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway was on Morning Joe and was asked about Obamacare. Her recitation of her boss\u2019s position likely filled congressional Republicans with dread. This is simply not realistic under any conceivable Obamacare replacement, as Republicans who work on health care policy understand. pic. twitter. \u2014 Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) January 3, 2017 This raises one of the central unanswered questions about Donald Trump. We know he wants to repeal Obamacare. But why does he want to repeal it? And how much of a political price is he willing to pay to repeal it?",
        "Senate Republicans took initial steps to repeal the Affordable Care Act Tuesday, using a process called budget reconciliation to start the process of gutting some of the health care law\u2019s major provisions. Update: Watch interview with President Obama on the future of Obamacare The budget reconciliation process is complex, and not the normal way that Congress passes laws. It is a process that starts with a budget resolution \u2014 essentially a list of spending targets for the coming years \u2014 and a set of instructions for how committees can hit those targets (in this case, by repealing Obamacare).",
        "When workers in the UK sat down for lunch on Wednesday, on average they had earned roughly around \u00a3150, or $185, so far this year. But by the time of that same meal, top British executives had already raked in more than \u00a328, 200, or $35, 000 \u2014 surpassing the amount of money those workers expect to earn over the course of all of 2017. That\u2019s the calculation of the High Pay Centre, a nonpartisan think tank that tracks income inequality trends in the UK.",
        "Following Donald Trump\u2019s election, the media tried to identify several indicators for why he won. Was it the opioid painkiller and heroin epidemic? Poor health outcomes? The economy? A new paper by political scientists Brian Schaffner, Matthew MacWilliams, and Tatishe Nteta puts the blame back on the same factors people pointed to before the election: racism and sexism.",
        "Early on weekday mornings, I often find myself panting and sweating beside strangers in a dark room. Riding stationary bicycles with nightclub music blaring in my ears isn\u2019t my idea of fun. But I turned to Flywheel\u2019s spinning classes after the YMCA next to my office shut down, and now I\u2019m hooked. The draws for me are the ruthless efficiency of 45 minutes of grinding interval work and the fitness returns \u2014 running is a lot easier since I started spinning. The studio is also just a short walk from my house.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s message during his presidential campaign was clear: America is being humiliated by the rest of the world. China is killing us on trade. Mexico\u2019s least desirables are streaming across our border. \u201cWe don\u2019t win anymore,\u201d Trump said, over and over. Trump\u2019s words hit on a psychological principle that scientists are beginning to understand. It\u2019s called collective narcissism, and it likely helps explain why Trump\u2019s slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d resonated with some Americans.",
        "A couple of years ago, free trade was seen as a key principle of the Republican Party. Then Donald Trump became the Republican nominee for president, and things got more complicated. \u201cThe Partnership is another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country,\u201d Trump said in June. The 1994 NAFTA free trade deal with Mexico and Canada was \u201cone of the worst things that ever happened to manufacturing industries,\u201d Trump added during a September debate. Since his election, Trump has made clear that this wasn\u2019t just talk.",
        "Halfway through La La Land, Damien Chazelle\u2019s critically beloved paean to the movie musicals of the 1950s, two characters have a conversation I\u2019m not precisely sure the movie or Chazelle understands. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) a diehard nostalgist who longs for the purity of early jazz, is having second thoughts about joining The Messengers, a band headed up by his old friend and rival Keith (John Legend). The Messengers play jazz, sort of. There\u2019s a horn section and occasionally some improvised riffs, but what they really offer is a kind of &B hybrid with subtle jazz influences on the side.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election victory, and Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss, was a devastating blow to feminism. America had a choice between its first woman president and an alleged sexual predator; between \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human rights\u201d and \u201cgrab \u2019em by the pussy\u201d; between telling our daughters they can do anything they want, and telling them that anything can be done to them by powerful, entitled men. We know which option America chose.",
        "Right after Donald Trump won the election, a number of observers worried that having a climate denier in the White House would be a crushing setback for efforts to tackle global warming. Here\u2019s a sample hyperventilating headline from, uh, me: \u201cThere\u2019s no way around it: Donald Trump looks like a disaster for the planet. \u201d Since then, though, there\u2019s been a bunch of optimistic reappraisals suggesting that perhaps not all is lost (see here, here, here, or here).",
        "Background checks are supposed to be the main line of defense against a dangerous person looking to buy a gun. But a new study found that 22 percent of gun purchases in the US go through without a background check. The study, published on Tuesday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, analyzed 2015 survey data of more than 1, 600 adult gun owners in the US, gauging whether gun owners had gone through a background check if they purchased a firearm in the past two years.",
        "The 115th Congress, which was officially sworn in on Tuesday, will be the most racially diverse Congress in history. Gender diversity, though, is another story. While 14 women were elected to Congress in 2016, the overall number of women in Congress is staying exactly the same \u2014 104, among both the House and Senate. The good news for equal representation is that the women\u2019s caucus will be more racially diverse. Women of color are now better represented than ever, with a 38 women of color (35 Democrats, three Republicans) serving in the 115th Congress.",
        "Many people are in the habit of not taking Donald Trump literally, and that appears to include investors on Wall Street who have responded to Trump\u2019s election with the sort of stock price boom you would have expected from the election of a completely orthodox free marketer like Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio. Trump has said, many times, that he favors a drastic revision of American trade policy aimed at making it much more difficult for companies to manufacture products in foreign markets (especially China) and then sell them to American consumers.",
        "Health care coverage has become more common in the United States than wearing a seatbelt, the AP reported earlier this year. The reason: 20 million Americans gained insurance under the Affordable Care Act, sending the uninsured rate plummeting to an low. But this might be about to change. Trump and congressional Republicans have promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and early Thursday morning, the Senate took a key vote that kicks off that process. Republicans say they will replace it with something much better.",
        "Programming note from Vox general manager Andrew Golis: When Melissa, Matt, and Ezra started Vox, they wrote on a regular basis about the challenges, experiments, and successes they had building the team and brand. But then they got busy building the team and brand! In 2017, we\u2019re bringing the \u201cHow we make Vox\u201d writing back. Sometimes, I\u2019ll offer updates on experiments and projects. Other times, like this, we\u2019ll share internal news and thinking about what we\u2019re doing.",
        "Last year, North Carolina Republicans passed a sweeping law that, among other measures, prohibited transgender people from using the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity in schools and government buildings. The law inspired a furious backlash, leading businesses to boycott the state and contributing to Gov. Pat McCrory\u2019s defeat on Election Day. Despite the backlash, Texas is gearing up to pass its own law prohibiting trans people from using the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity. On Thursday, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick unveiled SB6.",
        "Donald Trump, who takes the oath of office in just 15 days, has been publicly smearing the integrity and legitimacy of the US intelligence community on Twitter \u2014 disputing their assessment that Russia tried to influence the US election and mocking their erroneous War assertion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. Today, the intelligence community \u2014 and their supporters in Congress \u2014 fired back."
