        "For 2016, Democrats put all their chips on a bet that demographic destiny would sweep Hillary Clinton into the White House on the backs of the \u201crising\u201d Obama coalition of young, minority, and female voters. This gamble came up just short \u2014 in a narrow Electoral College loss with huge consequences for the country. Now partisans and pundits alike are debating the \u201ccrisis of the Democratic Party. \u201d Such stocktaking would have been needed in any event.",
        "You\u2019ve probably heard it before: Too many black students don\u2019t do well in school because they think being smart means \u201dacting white.\u201d Just last week, Columbia University English professor John McWhorter mentioned it in a piece for Vox to support his critique of elements of the Black Lives Matter platform. Key to his argument was the assertion that the similar goals of the 1960s \u201cwar on poverty failed,\u201d in part, due to black people\u2019s \u201ccultural traits and behaviors.",
        "The idea that liberals and cultural elites suffer from religious illiteracy is now widely accepted, by both the accusers and the accused. New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet confessed to NPR\u2019s Terry Gross that \u201cmedia powerhouses don\u2019t quite get religion. \u201d Former Obama White House staffer and evangelical Christian Michael Wear went further, arguing that liberals are \u201cdisdainful\u201d of religion and that there\u2019s a \u201creligious illiteracy problem in the Democratic Party.",
        "It was a horrific attack in Chicago, broadcast for the world to see on Facebook Live: A young woman and three others apparently held a horrified young man captive, his mouth taped shut and wrists tied as the alleged kidnappers took turns beating him and, at one point, cut his hair and scalp with a knife \u2014 all in an apparent hate crime. \u201cFuck Donald Trump,\u201d a person can be heard repeatedly shouting during the video, which was posted earlier this week. \u201cFuck white people.",
        "The actress looks at the audition judges, her eyes wide with nerves but softening nonetheless. This is Mia\u2019s big shot, and she knows it, and she\u2019s about to lose herself in completely crushing it. As performed by Emma Stone, the monologue that follows \u2014 a swelling, climactic scene in Damien Chazelle\u2019s La La Land \u2014 is Mia\u2019s crowning achievement. It\u2019s the only moment throughout the movie in which she gets to shine as the brightest star in a city full of twinkling talent, and both Stone and Mia grab the opportunity with both hands.",
        "Even though the GOP is about to control both the White House and Congress, they\u2019re still not free to do whatever they want. As they were reminded this week, congressional Republicans could still see their ambitions blocked by angry phone calls, or even a presidential tweet. The House GOP\u2019s failed attempt to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics this week provided an early glimpse into the hazards Republicans could encounter as they seek to push a sweeping policy agenda through Congress.",
        "Is Donald Trump a madman? Or, at least, would he like foreign leaders to think he might be just a little unstable? Such questions are being batted around in papers like the Boston Globe and the Washington Post in response to the \u2019s foreign policy moves: his provocations toward China, his attacks on NATO and the UN, his warm overtures toward Rodrigo Duterte and Vladimir Putin. Across the analysts are asking, is he crazy, or crazy like a fox? In no context is the question more pertinent than Trump\u2019s position on nuclear weapons.",
        "If you\u2019re around Washington, DC, while Donald Trump is getting sworn in on January 20, you might be able to pick up a surprising gift: free marijuana. The DC Cannabis Coalition, a legalization advocacy group, plans to hand out joints near Dupont Circle during Inauguration Day. But it\u2019s not just an act of charity; activists said that it\u2019s about sending a message. \u201cThe main message is it\u2019s time to legalize cannabis at the federal level,\u201d Adam Eidinger, a local marijuana legalization activist, told USA Today. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any money exchanged whatsoever.",
        "When I first told my doctor I wanted a vasectomy, I was 42 years old. She said I should wait, just to make sure. My doctor is younger than I am, and she had just had her first child. My wife and I do not have any children, and the doctor wanted to make sure that we didn\u2019t prematurely preclude ourselves from the joys of parenthood. Two years later, I told the doctor that my wife, Nicole, has been on birth control pills for most of her adult life.",
        "Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s grand scheme to connect US cities to one another with interstates was a great idea. It enhanced trade, economic development, and mobility. By contrast, jamming interstates and freeways through cities \u2014 something Eisenhower never envisioned \u2014 was a terrible idea. The power of cities is in the connections that form among people and institutions in close proximity. freeways destroy that connectivity. They chop cities into pieces, creating disconnected zones, isolating people from business districts and often from urban waterfronts.",
        "With Republicans set to control both the presidency and Congress in just two weeks, the future of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement \u2014 the Affordable Care Act \u2014 has been thrown into question, with the law\u2019s repeal looking like a real possibility. So on Friday morning, Vox\u2019s Ezra Klein and Sarah Kliff sat down with President Obama to talk Obamacare.",
        "President Barack Obama says he\u2019d be happy to get rid of Obamacare \u2014 if Republicans can replace it with something better. Addressing his comments to Republicans during an interview with Vox Friday morning, Obama said, \u201cIf you can in fact put a plan together that is demonstrably better than what Obamacare is doing, I will publicly support repealing Obamacare and replacing it with your plan. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have pride of authorship on this thing,\u201d the president added.",
        "Late Friday afternoon, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) released a declassified version of its report on Russia\u2019s interference in the US presidential election. The report, which draws on intelligence gathered by the FBI, CIA, and NSA, concludes with \u201chigh confidence\u201d that \u201cRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election\u201d that included hacking the personal email accounts of Democratic Party officials and political figures.",
        "At least eight people were injured and five were killed in a shooting on Friday at the airport in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, according to law enforcement officials. The story is quickly developing, so some details may be wrong and may change. But here\u2019s a rundown of what we know and don\u2019t know, based on the best information available so far. What we know: Shortly before 1 pm Eastern Time on Friday, there were reports of a shooting at terminal 2 baggage claim at the Fort Lauderdale \u2014 Hollywood International Airport. The attack lasted for less than 15 minutes.",
        "At 2:24 pm on Friday, Donald Trump concluded a meeting with America\u2019s top spies on their assessment that Russia hacked Hillary Clinton allies and released their emails to help Trump\u2019s campaign. The evidence, we know from both public sources and leaked intelligence community conclusions, is damning \u2014 yet Trump has continually cast doubt on it, even citing WikiLeaks head Julian Assange as a witness in his favor. Ten minutes after his briefing, his office released the following statement. The full text, appended below, doesn\u2019t contain a single whiff of apology (aside from pro forma praise for America\u2019s spies).",
        "Sarah Kliff and I interviewed President Obama this morning about Obamacare (you can watch the whole interview here). During the conversation, Obama made this promise to Republicans: \u201cI am saying to every Republican right now, if you in fact can put a plan together that is demonstrably better than what Obamacare is doing, I will publicly support repealing Obamacare and replacing it with your plan. But I want to see it first. \u201d The key here, of course, is a plan that is \u201cdemonstrably better than what Obamacare is doing. \u201d Obama to GOP: Make a better Obamacare!",
        "The 2017 Golden Globes, hosted by Jimmy Fallon, will be awarded on Sunday, January 8, with the ceremony airing live at 8 pm EST on NBC. With a reputation for being one of the most \u201cfun\u201d shows of awards season due to how early they fall in the season, the presence of alcohol (and thereby tipsy celebrities) and general unpredictability with regard to the winners, they\u2019re usually a pretty good time as far as awards shows are concerned.",
        "Advocates for reproductive health and rights are bracing for a big fight as soon as Donald Trump takes office. Trump has promised to appoint \u201c \u201d justices to the Supreme Court who could overturn Roe v. Wade. His administration will be full of people like Tom Price \u2014 who would lead the nation\u2019s health department while opposing basic health coverage for women under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and Vice Mike Pence, who was once the Congress member responsible for launching the GOP\u2019s war on Planned Parenthood in the first place.",
        "Julian Assange insists, against all evidence, that the hacked Democratic emails WikiLeaks published didn\u2019t come from Russian intelligence services. \u201cOur source is not the Russian government,\u201d he said in a Tuesday interview with Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity. This is a touch hard to believe. Publicly available evidence, including unique code and Russian writing in the hacked documents themselves, links the document theft to Russian hacks. Every US intelligence agency that has investigated the issue has concluded Russia is, in fact, responsible.",
        "Amazon doesn\u2019t have a booth at the Consumer Electronics Show, but Alexa is everywhere at the Las Vegas event this week. Dozens of companies have announced plans to work with the virtual assistant that powers the Echo, Amazon\u2019s smart speaker. LG is building Alexa into one of its refrigerators. GE made a fancy LED lamp. Even Ford has announced plans to add Alexa to its cars later this year. This means you\u2019ll be able to ask any of these products to look up recipes, play music, or tell you what the weather is like.",
        "For years, the conventional wisdom about diet has been that we get fat because we eat too many calories. Gary Taubes, the enfant terrible of nutrition writing, has long been making the case that that\u2019s wrong. In his newest book, The Case Against Sugar, he argues that it\u2019s actually the sweet stuff in our food that\u2019s the most probable cause of the parallel obesity and diabetes epidemics today (as well as contributing to heart disease, cancer, stroke, high blood pressure, and even dementia). Sugar, he argues, is making us sick. It\u2019s making us fat. And it\u2019s \u201cvery likely\u201d toxic.",
        "Prediction: In 2022, two stars will collide into one another. That collision will unleash a massive amount of energy. So massive, the two stars \u2014 which are now invisible to the naked eye \u2014 will increase in brightness by a factor of 10, 000. And not only will we be able to see this explosion, in real time, with unaided eyes, it will become one of the brightest objects in the entire sky. Astronomer Larry Molnar of Calvin College is making this prediction today at the meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Grapevine, Texas.",
        "In a few short weeks, Donald Trump will become our next president. As a disabled woman, I am terrified by what Trump\u2019s presidency means for me and my community. Throughout his campaign, Trump paid little attention to the disability community. Policies for people with disabilities were not part of his platform. Indeed, Trump\u2019s only real mention of people with disabilities was when he mocked a disabled reporter \u2014 and then repeatedly denied having done so. While Trump has been nearly silent on disability policy, he has been quite vocal on his intent to dismantle the health care system.",
        "The most remark of the fight to pass Obamacare arguably came from Nancy Pelosi. \u201cWe have to pass the bill so you can find out what is in it, away from the fog of the controversy,\u201d she said. That \u201cfog of controversy\u201d bit \u2014 which is usually dropped from recitations of Pelosi\u2019s quote \u2014 reveals what she was actually saying, which was that once the fight over the law\u2019s passage died down, the American people would find there was quite a lot to like in it. But Republicans correctly smelled blood.",
        "Over the weekend, a Cleveland Clinic doctor\u2019s blog post sparked a social media furor, prompting the prestigious medical center to issue a statement reaffirming its trust in vaccines. In an on Cleveland. com, entitled \u201dMake 2017 the year to avoid toxins (good luck) and master your domain,\u201d Dr. Daniel Neides, the medical director and chief operating officer of the Cleveland Clinic Wellness Institute, questioned whether vaccines have contributed to a rise in neurological diseases like autism and ADHD and argued that ingredients in them are harmful to newborns.",
        "Just three days before the mass shooting at the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, airport, the Florida legislature was considering a bill that would allow people to openly carry firearms in airports. Washington Post reporter Dave Weigel pointed out the news on Twitter, based on a Tallahassee Democrat report from January 3: Florida Open Carry Inc. began rallying its troops New Year\u2019s Eve with a mass email in support of \u201cthe most important Amendment rights bill of the 2017 legislative session. \u201d SB 140 repeals laws forbidding guns on college campuses, in airports terminals, and at government meetings. Sen.",
        "The marriage plot, which gave so many of the great novels and movies their structure, has been eulogized countless times. It is impossible, the theory goes, for a marriage plot to have real stakes in this era of divorces and women\u2019s economic liberation. The marriage plot is effectively dead. In the 21st century, Mr. Rochester isn\u2019t going to lock his mad wife in the attic; he\u2019s going to send her to an institution and quietly get a divorce, and there goes the plot of Jane Eyre.",
        "The 2017 Golden Globe Awards, hosted by Jimmy Fallon, will air live on NBC on Sunday, January 8, at 8 pm EST. Like last year, there won\u2019t be a live stream of the ceremony available for those who don\u2019t have cable, so tuning in on NBC is your only option (last year NBC let cable subscribers view the show on NBC. com with a cable provider login, but that\u2019s not the case this year).",
        "The Democratic Party\u2019s upcoming campaign to save Obamacare will kick off Monday night with a pep rally on the Senate floor. In an event they say could stretch long into the night, congressional Democrats will a \u201ctalkathon\u201d within the halls of Congress recounting stories from tens of millions of people who stand to lose health care if the Affordable Care Act is dismantled. Part of the purpose of the event is to steel Democrats for what\u2019s shaping up to be a fight with the new Republican Congress over the law.",
        "The two things that made me think Obamacare repeal isn\u2019t a sure thing \u2014 One month ago, as the surprise of the election wore off and the reality of a Washington sunk in, I would have predicted that Obamacare repeal was a foregone conclusion. Republicans have spent six years promising to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They have maintained incredible party unity on the issue, not wavering even as millions of people gained coverage. Legislators quickly moved to make it their first agenda item in Congress. The matter felt settled."
