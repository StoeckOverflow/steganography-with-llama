        "At Sunday\u2019s Golden Globes, venerable actress Meryl Streep received the Cecil B. DeMille Award for \u201coutstanding contributions to the world of entertainment\u201d \u2014 and in so doing made a controversial speech that took direct aim at Donald Trump without ever mentioning him by name. Streep\u2019s speech dominated conversation online for most of Sunday night and the following morning, garnering responses across the political spectrum. Some praised the speech as \u201cepic and powerful,\u201d while others called it a classic example of Hollywood \u201celitism.",
        "It\u2019s not unusual for a new company to lose money as it seeks market share and traction, but Uber is testing investors\u2019 patience to a degree that\u2019s unprecedented in the history of Silicon Valley. Uber just shared its 2016 financial results with Bloomberg, and they show that the app lost $2. 8 billion last year \u2014 and that\u2019s excluding losses from the China division Uber sold last August. It\u2019s a staggering sum, and with the company losing almost $1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016 alone, there seems to be no end in sight.",
        "On Sunday, Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro raised the country\u2019s minimum wage by a whopping 50 percent. But it wasn\u2019t much of a surprise \u2014 the country has already raised the minimum wage four times in the past year alone, in an attempt to adapt to a crippling inflation crisis that has caused the price of basic necessities like food to skyrocket to astronomical levels.",
        "Donald Trump is alarming to liberals in many ways, not least of all because he simply does things that defy the \u201cnormal\u201d rules of politics. He disregards transparency, his bizarre tweets are often false or offensive, and he dismisses all kinds of unspoken rules governing everything from financial conflicts of interest to dialogue with the political leadership of Taiwan. This naturally leads to nostalgia for his more conventional predecessors, including the man liberals spent the past decade scorning \u2014 George W. Bush.",
        "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has a simple request for Majority Leader Mitch McConnell: Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees must meet the same traditional standards that were demanded of President Barack Obama\u2019s nominees eight years ago. In fact, the request is so similar that Schumer sent the exact same letter McConnell sent to Harry Reid, then the Democratic majority leader of the Senate, and simply swapped out some of the names: Our requests are eminently reasonable, shared by leaders of both parties. I\u2019ll return this letter to @SenateMajLdr with the same requests. pic. twitter.",
        "Throughout its run, The Good Wife \u2014 which aired from 2009 to 2016 \u2014 embraced its status as a legal drama airing specifically under Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, exploring issues of national security, increasingly precarious privacy, and the potential for local politics to have a national impact. So it\u2019s fitting that the series\u2019 upcoming spinoff The Good Fight, which premieres February 19, will nod to the fact that it\u2019s debuting shortly after a dramatically different president takes office . .. even if that wasn\u2019t always the plan.",
        "On Sunday\u2019s Face the Nation, Sen. Mitch McConnell teed off on the Affordable Care Act: MCCONNELL: Well, what you need to understand is that there are 25 million Americans who aren\u2019t covered now. If the idea behind Obamacare was to get everyone covered, that\u2019s one of the many failures. In addition to premiums going up, copayments going up, deductibles going up.",
        "The Senate took a crucial step to pave the way toward repealing Obamacare early Thursday morning, passing a budget resolution that would let Republicans\u2019 eventual repeal bill move through the chamber with just 51 votes. The measure passed with every Senate Democrat present opposing it, and every Senate Republican except Sen. Rand Paul ( ) supporting it. If the House of Representatives passes the same measure \u2014 and they plan to do so later this week \u2014 it will go into effect, and make sure that Obamacare repeal cannot be filibustered by Senate Democrats.",
        "As Golden Globe ceremonies go, the 74th was disappointingly tame. Yes, some of the celebrities in the crowd had obviously taken one too many trips to the bar. And, yes, there were some amusing bits. (Our favorite? Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig introducing the Best Animated Movie category.) But for the most part, the ceremony took on the personality of its host, Jimmy Fallon. It was basically fine, but distinctly unmemorable.",
        "The Russian Embassy in the United Kingdom loves to troll the West on Twitter. On Monday morning, it outdid itself \u2014 tweeting an image of a cartoon frog linked to Donald Trump\u2019s white nationalist fans: In today\u2019s papers: pundits call on @Theresa_May to disrupt possible thaw. No trust in Britain\u2019s best friend and ally? pic. twitter. \u2014 Russian Embassy, UK (@RussianEmbassy) January 9, 2017 Even absent the image, the tweet would be pretty trolly.",
        "By now, so much has been said about Sherlock\u2019s constant embrace of narcissism that it feels redundant to go over it again for yet another one of the series\u2019 few and episodes. Yet Sunday\u2019s season four episode, \u201cThe Lying Detective,\u201d cycles through the same beats we\u2019re already well acquainted with: Sherlock embarking on a dangerous long game in order to catch someone deadly, John lashing out with violence as Sherlock\u2019s plan unfolds, and Sherlock flirting with disaster in the form of untold drug addictions, only to emerge, once again, victorious and vindicated by the depth of his own intellect.",
        "Malaysia is a country that I know well, and whose political system I have studied closely for 15 years. It is also not a democracy. Malaysia has a multiparty parliamentary system of government, but the same coalition of parties has been in power for six decades, and has never lost a general election. In a holdover from the British colonial period, Malaysia\u2019s government retains the legal authority to detain people without trial if it so desires. The print and broadcast media are fairly compliant, mostly owned by the corporate allies of political elites, and rarely criticize the government.",
        "The 2004 election gave President George W. Bush a second term in office and expanded Republican majorities in both houses of Congress. So soon afterward, he pledged to spend the \u201cpolitical capital\u201d he said he\u2019d earned on a longtime conservative priority \u2014 the partial privatization of Social Security. The effort failed. Despite those sizable GOP majorities and the president\u2019s own barnstorming across the country to sell his proposal, creating private accounts for Social Security became so toxic that it was never brought to a vote in either the House or Senate.",
        "Late on Tuesday afternoon, CNN dropped an absolute bombshell of a story \u2014 the heads of America\u2019s top intelligence agencies showed Donald Trump evidence that the Russian government may have \u201ccompromising personal and financial\u201d information on him and that his campaign spoke directly with Kremlin intermediaries. \u201cThe allegations came, in part, from memos compiled by a former British intelligence operative, whose past work US intelligence officials consider credible,\u201d write CNN\u2019s Evan Perez, Jim Sciutto, Jake Tapper, and Carl Bernstein (yes, that Carl Bernstein). After CNN\u2019s report, BuzzFeed published the British officer\u2019s full dossier, which you can read here.",
        "Barack Obama\u2019s presidency will soon come to an end, and he will deliver a farewell address to the nation tonight at 9 pm Eastern in Chicago. The speech will air on most major broadcast networks, and a live stream is embedded above. The address comes at a tense and uncertain moment in American politics. Donald Trump, whom Obama has called \u201cunfit to serve,\u201d is preparing to take the office. Trump has pledged to deport many more unauthorized immigrants, sharply limit Muslim immigration, repeal Obamacare, roll back climate change regulations, and build up the US\u2019s nuclear weapons arsenal.",
        "Public discussions of racism are notoriously frustrating, but there\u2019s one especially aggravating related trend that took off during the election season and that I\u2019d love for people to commit to eliminating in 2017: a push for vanity sizing. Yes, vanity sizing for racism. The original term applies to the way clothing manufacturers have gradually adjusted their sizing in a way that appeases the growing number of shoppers who, because of societal shame around weight, would rather see a label that says 6 than one that says 16.",
        "Trumpism isn\u2019t getting a confirmation hearing in the US Senate. But the confirmation hearing of Jeff Sessions, nominated to be attorney general in the Trump administration, is the next best thing. Sessions has been one of Trump\u2019s closest policy advisers since before he won the Republican presidential nomination, and many Sessions advisers now staff the presidential transition team or have been named to Trump\u2019s White House. The combination of populist immigration hawkery and \u201c \u201d rhetoric that defined much of Trump\u2019s successful presidential campaign was Sessions\u2019s hallmark back when Trump was still a Democrat.",
        "Every House Democrat has joined a call for Congress to set up an independent and bipartisan commission to probe Russia\u2019s interference in the US presidential election. The problem is that not a single congressional Republican has supported their effort, basically ensuring it won\u2019t succeed. In a letter released by Rep. Elijah Cummings, more than 170 House Democrats endorsed legislation that would create a commission similar to the one that investigated the September 11, 2001, attacks to look into Russian election meddling.",
        "When he sits down Wednesday for his confirmation hearing, Secretary of Rex Tillerson will immediately become one of the most unusual picks to be the America\u2019s top diplomat in recent US history. A former ExxonMobil CEO, Rex Tillerson has no experience inside the US government and a long record of working with foreign powers, most notably Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. That relationship led Sen. John McCain, a leading Russia hawk, to say he could only support Tillerson \u201cwhen pigs fly. \u201d McCain\u2019s office later claimed this was a joke.",
        "Within 10 days of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory, the Office of Government Ethics was already worried. Its purpose is to ensure an ethical transition, enforcing the laws banning financial conflicts of interest for administration officials. But in the immediate aftermath of the election, the and his team were AWOL. Meanwhile, the ethics office faced a monumental task: working closely with the transition team to gather, review, and sign off on thousands of pages of financial disclosures for new appointees and advisers.",
        "Beyonc\u00e9 and Solange Knowles are, simply put, brilliant. Most recently, the sisters released two of 2016\u2019s best albums with Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade and Solange\u2019s A Seat at the Table. More continually, they\u2019ve each crafted their careers in exactly the image they intend. Beyonc\u00e9 famously grants precious few interviews, the better to tell her story exactly as she wants to, through her music and onstage speeches; Solange took four years to write and produce A Seat at the Table to make sure it matched the vision in her head.",
        "Senate confirmation hearings usually focus on the people nominated to the government\u2019s most powerful positions. This time around, they\u2019ll focus on the man who nominated them. The first batch of Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees will start the confirmation process this week, with Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee today and a whopping five other nominees \u2014 including Trump\u2019s controversial picks for secretary of state and CIA director \u2014 heading to Capitol Hill on Wednesday.",
        "In October 2015, a college student named Lauren Batchelder stood up at a campaign forum in Manchester, New Hampshire, and challenged Donald Trump\u2019s record on women\u2019s issues. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m wrong,\u201d she said, \u201cmaybe you can prove me wrong, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a friend to women. \u201d So far, this might sound like a perfectly ordinary case of campaign confrontation, but things soon took a more surprising turn. Trump attacked Batchelder personally on Twitter, describing her as \u201dnasty\u201d and an \u201darrogant young woman,\u201d and even suggesting she was secretly working for Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign.",
        "At least five people were killed and 45 people were injured during and after a shooting Friday at the airport in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Police have identified the suspect as Esteban Santiago, a National Guard veteran. He most recently lived in Anchorage, Alaska \u2014 where, the Alaska Dispatch News reports, he was charged with domestic violence in January 2016. Santiago\u2019s girlfriend told police that he had bashed in her bathroom door and tried to strangle her.",
        "Crazy The CW\u2019s sparklingly brilliant musical antihero comedy, has received an early season three renewal from the network. Instead of having to bite its nails until May, the show was lumped in with six of The CW\u2019s other shows in a January renewal announcement. Here\u2019s what\u2019s interesting about this news, though: There\u2019s no way to make an argument for renewing Crazy based on its performance. It\u2019s the show on television, and, so far as I can tell, it\u2019s the show ever to be renewed by a major broadcast network. Yes, ever.",
        "Former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of state, is clearly an intelligent and man. During the first six hours or so of his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday, Tillerson was polished, articulate, and clearly knowledgeable about countries ranging from Saudi Arabia to North Korea to Equatorial Guinea. The hearing went badly for him anyway. There was one issue, above all others, that mattered in these hearings: Russia.",
        "Donald Trump explained very clearly at Wednesday morning\u2019s press conference why he won\u2019t release his tax returns, thus leaving the public entirely in the dark as to who may or may not be paying him off: \u201cI won. \u201d It\u2019s as good an explanation as any. Norms are important in politics and government. But norms get a fair amount of their bite from fear. Fear that if you break them, you\u2019ll come in for damaging criticism and lose public support.",
        "With reports that the Russian government may have dirt that they are using to blackmail Donald Trump setting the political world ablaze, it\u2019s worth being clear about two things. One is that the content of these reports is unverified and, likely, unverifiable. What\u2019s more, to the extent that any of it could be verified, it\u2019s inconceivable that the Intelligence Community would publicly reveal the kind of human or signals intelligence sources that could verify it. So as far as the public knows, we are never really going to know.",
        "Donald Trump has called his election a historic landslide, but it was anything but. Only two other presidents have been elected with smaller popular vote margins since records began in 1824. His edge in the Electoral College, while decisive, depends on less than 80, 000 votes across three states (Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania) out of more than 135 million cast nationwide. It was a very close election. In a close election, there are a million reasons \u201cwhy\u201d it was close. Trump\u2019s popularity with whites. Turnout among the Democratic base. Campaign malpractice in the Midwest. Jill Stein. Millennials.",
        "Seth Meyers welcomed Donald Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway to Late Night on January 10 for an interview, greeting her with a jovial smile. He extended warm congratulations for her being the first woman to manage a winning presidential campaign. He even conceded that Conway\u2019s distaste for people who say that Trump isn\u2019t their president makes sense \u2014 but by his sentence\u2019s end, Meyers made his own position clear with a barbed joke."
