        "Donald Trump promised Americans \u201csomething terrific\u201d in place of Obamacare, but it\u2019s simply not possible to replace it with something that\u2019s better for most people unless you violate the core tenets of conservative ideology. At times on the campaign trail, Trump suggested that he was, in fact, prepared to violate core tenets of conservative ideology. That\u2019s one thing some of the voters who picked him liked about him. And while he\u2019s done little since Election Day to suggest that he intends to follow through on that promise, there\u2019s no reason Democrats can\u2019t do it for him.",
        "It\u2019s not surprising that Donald Trump\u2019s key Cabinet nominees are being asked to defend his most controversial statements at their confirmation hearings. What\u2019s surprising is the way some of them are responding: by telling skeptical lawmakers that they hadn\u2019t actually discussed the issues with the . John Kelly, Trump\u2019s pick to head the Department of Homeland Security, says he hasn\u2019t talked to Trump about immigration. Rex Tillerson, nominated for secretary of state, says he hasn\u2019t talked to Trump about Russia.",
        "There\u2019s an enormous amount we don\u2019t yet know about CNN\u2019s bombshell report that US intelligence agencies believe Russia has \u201ccompromising personal and financial information\u201d on Donald Trump and that his campaign was in direct contact with Russian intermediaries before the election. We don\u2019t know who CNN\u2019s sources are or if those people\u2019s information is accurate. We don\u2019t know which Trump aides were allegedly dealing with the Russians or whether those Russians worked for Vladimir Putin\u2019s government. And we don\u2019t know the answer to the biggest question of them all: Just what does Russia have on Trump?",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s team is defending attorney general nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions from accusations that he unfairly investigated black activists for voter fraud in the 1980s, citing an article alleging that \u201cblack Democrats\u201d really did steal votes. At day two of the attorney general confirmation for Sessions, a Trump transition staffer stopped by the reporters\u2019 table and dropped off a dossier of stories defending Sessions\u2019s record. Among the stories cited was an article by Hans von Spakovsky in the Conservative Review titled, \u201cHow Black Democrats Stole Votes in Alabama and Jeff Sessions Tried to Stop It.",
        "President Obama participated in a venerable tradition Tuesday night by using his farewell address to give warnings about his fears for America\u2019s future. While the speech was broadly optimistic in tone and avoided any significant discussion of the man who will soon occupy the White House, the bulk of the text was devoted to expressing his fears about how things could go wrong for the United States. Saying early on that his speech\u2019s theme would be \u201cthe state of our democracy,\u201d Obama went on: \u201cThere have been moments throughout our history that threatened to rupture that solidarity.",
        "One of the bitterest fights being waged in Congress right now is over an acrylic painting by a teenager in Missouri that almost nobody had heard of until this Friday. For seven months, the painting (shown below) sat in the middle of a tunnel connecting the US Capitol to a House office building after it was hung there by Missouri Democratic Rep. Lacy Clay: The painting by Missouri student David Pulphus, 18, was hung there after he won a local art competition in Clay\u2019s district.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s press conference today is a long time coming. It\u2019s been 168 days since his last one, on July 27, and six weeks since he promised \u2014 and canceled \u2014 a press conference where he said he\u2019d explain how he\u2019ll disentangle his business interests from his presidency.",
        "If you worked a factory shift in Michigan in January 2009, when Barack Obama assumed the office of the presidency, you were wrestling with two manners of economic crisis. One was the immediate threat to your job. If you lost it, you were in danger of losing your car, and your house too. The other moved slower than the flood of the financial crisis. It was the realization that came into picture over many years \u2014 that the economic future you were once promised was drifting away. That imminent crisis has long since receded.",
        "Rex Tillerson\u2019s confirmation hearing has been a fairly staid affair so far. But one relatively intense exchange came when Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine pressed him on ExxonMobil\u2019s history on climate change. As anyone who has read the blockbuster investigations from Inside Climate News and the LA Times knows, documents show that Exxon\u2019s scientists were aware of the scientific consensus on the threat of climate change way back in the 1970s. Exxon did its own research on the subject and made plans to address it.",
        "Mere miles from where Barack Obama gave his presidential victory speech in Grant Park, Chicago, eight years ago, he delivered a symbolic farewell speech at Chicago\u2019s McCormick Place Tuesday night. It\u2019s not the first time Obama has taken the opportunity to reflect on his administration\u2019s accomplishments. But after monumental losses for Democrats in the last election, his farewell speech was geared toward what\u2019s next. \u201dIt\u2019s a passing of the baton\u201d to the next generation of Democrats, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told a group of reporters before the speech, according to the Chicago Tribune.",
        "Midway through Paterson, Jim Jarmusch\u2019s lovely tribute to finding the poetic beauty in everyday life, lead character Paterson (yes, that\u2019s his name, and he\u2019s played by Adam Driver) stops to talk to a young girl. She, like him, is an aspiring poet. But she\u2019s still in school, with her whole life ahead of her. He already has a job, driving a bus through the streets of Paterson, New Jersey. (Yep, it\u2019s the name of the town, too.) His poems \u2014 written by American poet Ron Padgett \u2014 are frequently, starkly beautiful. But he\u2019s hesitant to do anything with them.",
        "A week before Barack Obama hands the presidency over to Donald Trump, the outgoing administration is making a significant change to American immigration policy. But not in the way you might think: Obama is making it harder, not easier, for certain people to enter the US. According to reports from the Associated Press and the Washington Post, the White House will be ending the policy that allowed any Cuban national who reached US soil to enter the country legally on humanitarian grounds.",
        "Republicans in Congress are taking the first of three steps necessary to repeal the Affordable Care Act: The Senate passed the budget resolution to start that process at 1 am on Thursday, and the House is expected to do the same on Friday. And as they work to repeal the ACA, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan promised last week that Republicans in Congress also plan to defund Planned Parenthood.",
        "Early in Thursday\u2019s Senate confirmation hearings for Gen. James Mattis, Trump\u2019s pick for secretary of defense, Sen. Jack Reed asked something that, for most Trump nominees, would be a tough question: What do you think about working with Russia to solve problems? Mattis\u2019s answer was blunt, and very . \u201cI\u2019m all for engagement, but we have to recognize reality,\u201d the general said. \u201cThere are a decreasing number of areas where we can cooperate, and an increasing number of areas in which we will have to confront Russia.",
        "For months during the presidential primaries last summer, a debate raged over whether Bernie Sanders was \u201creally\u201d a Democrat. Sanders caucused with the Democrats in the Senate, but spent three decades as a registered independent and once scoffed at the Democratic and Republican candidates for Vermont governor as \u201cTweedledum and Tweedledee. \u201d However, the outcome of the election has pushed Sanders more firmly into the Democratic tent. In November, Sanders was elevated to a leadership position under Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as the party\u2019s official \u201coutreach chair.",
        "President Barack Obama had a surprise up his sleeve Thursday at a tribute to the vice president, awarding Joe Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction. Biden will be the third vice president to be awarded a Medal of Freedom. Just eight days from their last day in office, Obama ran through Biden\u2019s legacy almost in its entirety, including the vice president\u2019s work as a young Delaware senator, as an advocate for women\u2019s safety, and in his two terms in executive office, calling him a \u201clion of American history.",
        "Welcome to Today in Obamacare, Vox\u2019s regular update on the battle over the Affordable Care Act, the changes a new president and new Congress might make, and what it means for the American people. Have a story you think should be here? Send me an email at sarah@vox. com. Let\u2019s explore some Republican health policy plans \u2014 One of the biggest shifts this week \u2014 driven largely by Donald Trump and a handful of Republican senators \u2014 is one away from \u201crepeal and delay\u201d and toward \u201crepeal and replace.",
        "There\u2019s been no shortage of protests in the face of an impending Donald Trump presidency, and some of the loudest have come from performers, entertainers, artists, and writers \u2014 many of whom are prominent in their fields. But though everyone wants to make a statement, no singular tactic is at play. Instead, protesting artists have proposed everything from boycotts to museum closures to public statements. Boycott has been the response of choice for most artists asked to perform at the inauguration.",
        "BuzzFeed\u2019s decision to publish an unverified intelligence report, filled with explosive and lewd allegations about Donald Trump, has triggered intense criticism from Trump and an ethics debate among journalists. More importantly for BuzzFeed, it might invite a defamation suit. The intelligence report includes claims that the Russian government possesses materials that could blackmail Trump, including financial information and video of him engaging in sexual acts. Trump and his team say there is no truth in that dossier. If that\u2019s true, they could have a legal case against BuzzFeed.",
        "Last fall, the Environmental Protection Agency discovered that Volkswagen had used illegal \u201cdefeat device\u201d software that enabled hundreds of thousands of diesel vehicles to cheat on their pollution tests. As a result, the cars emitted far more harmful nitrogen oxide on the road than they did during laboratory testing. This ended up being a huge global scandal that cost VW billions of dollars. Now the scandal may be widening. On Thursday, the EPA also accused Fiat Chrysler of cheating \u2014 by failing to disclose software in at least 104, 000 diesel vehicles that could increase their emission levels.",
        "At his first press conference as Donald Trump repeatedly slammed two of the biggest media companies in the country for publishing blockbuster articles claiming that Russia has compromising personal and financial information that it could use to blackmail him. But Trump\u2019s attack conflated two very different stories \u2014 eliding a swirling controversy inside the journalism profession about the approach of the outlets that published them, one with broader implications for how we understand the press\u2019s relationship with Trump.",
        "As chair of the Council of Economic Advisers since August 2013, Jason Furman has been President Barack Obama\u2019s chief economist, holding that job during a time when unemployment dropped below 5 percent. But he was also in the trenches in the Obama administration during the depths of the recession (when unemployment hit 10 percent) working at the National Economic Council, helping to formulate and sell the Recovery Act and other stimulus bills.",
        "Shigeru Miyamoto is a big name in gaming. Since he first designed Donkey Kong in 1981, he\u2019s been called \u201cthe father of modern video games\u201d \u2014 and for good reason. Right after Donkey Kong\u2019s release, the North American video game market came close to collapse in the early 1980s. Console sales alone peaked at over $3 billion in 1983 before plummeting to around $100 million by 1985. Miyamoto\u2019s subsequent games (Super Mario Bros. The Legend of Zelda, Star Fox) are often credited with jumpstarting the industry in North America. So how does he do it?",
        "Obamacare repeal just took a big step forward. Shortly after 1 am Thursday morning, the Senate voted 51 to 48 along party lines to approve the budget that Republicans want to use to repeal the health care law. It\u2019s bad news for Obamacare supporters and the 20 million people who rely on it for insurance. Earlier this week, a group of moderate Republicans \u2014 led by Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker \u2014 had proposed delaying the budget to give the GOP more time to figure out its replacement package.",
        "Despite all the tense, even openly hostile moments to come out of Donald Trump\u2019s first press conference as some of the most surprising moments came not from the podium, but from the back of the room. From Vice Mike Pence\u2019s glowing introduction through Trump\u2019s harsh dismissal of the reporters before him, one of the most prominent features of this press conference \u2014 meant to be a source of clarity for reporters on his many conflicts of interest \u2014 was applause.",
        "President Obama\u2019s farewell address came as Washington obsessed over a sketchy intelligence report alleging that Donald Trump is being blackmailed by Moscow with a tape of perverted sex acts. Somehow, it was fitting. Obama\u2019s presidency was tumultuous, polarizing, and consequential. He presided over the grinding recovery from a financial crisis, the controversial reshaping of America\u2019s social safety net, the end of two wars, and a bitterly divided polity. He ran promising to bring Americans together only to find himself splitting them apart.",
        "The Chicago Police Department routinely violates civil rights, uses unnecessary force, discriminates against minority residents, and fails to hold officers accountable \u2014 creating a climate of distrust, violence, and fear that makes residents and cops unsafe. That\u2019s according to a massive new report that the US Department of Justice released on Friday. As part of the investigation for the report, the Justice Department reviewed thousands of pages of documents, conducted hundreds of interviews with officials and residents, and participated in dozens of observations with police over 13 months.",
        "hFirst it was too many calories. Then it was too much fat. Now there\u2019s a war on sugar, our latest dietary enemy No. 1. In health policy and nutrition science circles, this single nutrient is taking up a lot of oxygen these days. Sugar is being blamed for the obesity and diabetes epidemics. We\u2019ve started to tax it in our beverages and remove it from our schools. New York Times columnists and svelte celebrities are eliminating it from their diets to retrain their palates or detox for the new year.",
        "Donald Trump defied the odds to win the 2016 US presidential election. When he announced his candidacy, virtually nobody thought he had a shot at securing the Republican Party nomination. Having done so, he consistently trailed Hillary Clinton in the polls right up to Election Day, leading to a reasonable widespread presumption that he was going to lose. While poll averages had Clinton beating Trump by 5 points nationally, she in fact beat him by just slightly over 2 points.",
        "Rep. Drew Ferguson ( ) just used a metaphor to describe Obamacare: a rogue goat. This is like the GOAT of all Obamacare metaphors. pic. twitter. \u2014 Dan Diamond (@ddiamond) January 13, 2017 Ferguson went on at length on the House floor about this goat, telling a story about what the goat\u2019s been up to for the past six years. It\u2019s kind of hard to sort out what\u2019s what, so we decided to illustrate the metaphor to see if we can get this straight."
