        "BuzzFeed published a dossier earlier this week full of unsubstantiated claims about Donald Trump\u2019s ties to Russia. Most of the discussion since then has orbited around the veracity of the claims and the ethics of the organization that published them. (For a thorough account, read this explainer by Vox\u2019s Zack Beauchamp.) What has received less attention is the intelligence value of documents themselves. It\u2019s not clear how seriously we should take them, or how seriously the intelligence community takes them. Remember: The dossier isn\u2019t an official document of the intelligence community.",
        "If you had any doubts about the \u201dnightmare\u201d and \u201dcatastrophic threat\u201d of antimicrobial resistance, take a look at this new field report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nevada public health officials tell the story of a Washoe County resident who appeared at a Reno hospital in August 2016 with sepsis. Doctors found out that she was infected with a type of enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, superbug called Klebsiella pneumoniae and quickly put her in isolation.",
        "A synagogue burning in Germany is perhaps among the most literal illustrations of imaginable. But apparently, not all synagogue burnings are equal. This week a German regional court ruled that the 2014 firebombing of a synagogue in Wuppertal, a region just east of D\u00fcsseldorf, was an act of criminal arson, but not . Instead, the court found it was a protest against Israel, even though the synagogue was obviously not in Israel and those who worship there are Jews, not Israelis.",
        "\u201cRepeal and replace Obamacare. \u201d It\u2019s a simple, clear, crisp campaign slogan. Now that Republicans are set to assume unified control of government, they\u2019re discovering it\u2019s an incredibly complicated reality. To repeal the bulk of Obamacare, the GOP will have to keep 218 House members and at least 50 senators \u2014 and majorities of relevant committees \u2014 together.",
        "How much should an adaptation stand on its own, divorced from the original source material that inspired it? This is the question I tried to answer as I watched Netflix\u2019s adaptation of Lemony Snicket\u2019s A Series of Unfortunate Events, because \u2014 to be upfront \u2014 I never read Daniel Handler\u2019s books as a kid or otherwise.",
        "Anxiety in China has been mounting for some time over continued provocations from the incoming Trump administration. Now Chinese media outlets have started sounding the alarm in response to comments by Rex Tillerson, Trump\u2019s nominee to be secretary of state, about taking unprecedented steps against China\u2019s territorial claims in the hotly disputed South China Sea. \u201dIf Trump\u2019s diplomatic team shapes future ties as it is doing now, the two sides had better prepare for a military clash,\u201d said one particularly belligerent editorial in the Chinese Global Times newspaper.",
        "If you live in a city or a suburb, chances are you\u2019ve seen the health of people around you improve over time \u2014 fewer deaths from cardiovascular disease, better cancer treatments, and fewer premature deaths. But if you\u2019re one of the 46 million Americans who live in a rural area, odds are you\u2019ve watched the health of your neighbors stagnate and worsen.",
        "Just a few months ago, things were looking very bleak for the private prison industry. In the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general issued a report finding that privately operated federal prisons are more dangerous than those managed by the federal Bureau of Prisons and need more oversight. Within a week, the Justice Department announced it would phase out private prisons to house federal inmates. Later that month, the Department of Homeland Security announced it would evaluate whether detention operations conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement should move in the same direction.",
        "At this point, we still don\u2019t know exactly what the Trump administration plans to do about the Paris climate accord \u2014 the core international treaty for dealing with global warming. During the campaign, Donald Trump kept insisting he\u2019d withdraw from the Paris deal as soon as possible. Except now his nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, sounds more hesitant about pulling out. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that the United States maintain its seat at the table in the conversation on how to address threats of climate change,\u201d Tillerson said at his confirmation hearings.",
        "No show on television enjoys having its yellowcake uranium and eating it too as much as Showtime\u2019s Homeland, which officially begins its sixth season on January 15. (The season premiere is already available online to subscribers.) The series feints toward being a serious critique of the American intelligence apparatus, and from time to time, it\u2019s as scathing a look at the intelligence community as one could imagine commercial television coming up with.",
        "Marijuana has been with humans in some way or another for thousands of years. But after all this time, there is still a lot of public debate about what, exactly, pot\u2019s risks and benefits are. A recent review of the research from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine attempts to fill the gap in our knowledge. By combing through more than 10, 000 studies published since 1999, the review, conducted by more than a dozen experts, provides the clearest look at the scientific evidence on marijuana yet.",
        "Not all queens are created equal. In the past few years, a couple of different TV shows have aimed to show viewers the inner workings of the English monarchy. E\u2019s The Royals, now in its third season, conjures up a trashy, soap opera with vindictive (and fictional) Queen Helena pulling all the strings. On the other side of the spectrum is Netflix\u2019s The Crown, which debuted its first season in November. It\u2019s a gorgeous prestige drama that meticulously traces the life of Queen Elizabeth II as she navigates conflicts between crown, duty, and her personal life.",
        "The folks at Streetfilms have a new video that celebrates Seattle\u2019s recent progress on transit. (You should also check out their film on Vancouver, which I wrote about recently.) The video focuses on buses, particularly downtown and bus rapid transit (BRT) routes, which have improved markedly and now carry many more people than they used to. But even the video undersells Seattle\u2019s newfound . For years, Seattle has been a transit laggard and something of a comedy of errors, going all the way back to voters famously and fatefully rejecting a rail system in 1970.",
        "As you read this, I will have pulled off a miraculous accomplishment: escaping winter. I will be sitting on a tropical beach, gently caressed by sunlight and ocean breezes, reading as many galleys as I can fit into my . For you, gentle reader, whether you\u2019re trapped in snowy January weather or a fellow winter escapee, I have collected the week\u2019s best writing on books and related subjects. But I had to do this one early, so it\u2019s more like the best writing from the first half of the week.",
        "On Monday afternoon, the Pew Research Center released its annual report on how Americans see foreign policy \u2014 which focused, appropriately, on Russia. Its findings are striking. The report\u2019s findings make a very compelling case that Donald Trump\u2019s victory has, transformed the way Americans see Russia. Republicans are more friendly to Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime, and Democrats more hostile, than at any point in Pew\u2019s of polling. It\u2019s a testament to just how powerfully partisan politics shapes the way Americans see the world.",
        "John Lewis is probably not the person you want to accuse of \u201call talk, no action\u201d if you\u2019re the of the United States. Lewis is a leader of the civil rights movement and a veteran of the House of Representatives; he\u2019s a Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient and an American hero. But on some level, Donald Trump\u2019s tweets lashing out at Lewis (who had called the \u201cillegitimate\u201d in an interview with Chuck Todd on Friday) are totally expected, even inevitable. It\u2019s what Lewis has been dealing with all his life.",
        "Ask any American over the age of 7 what the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. stood for, and chances are you\u2019ll hear something about how the color of your skin shouldn\u2019t determine the way you\u2019re treated. That\u2019s a fair answer, and it does represent one element of the iconic civil rights leader\u2019s vision.",
        "Donald Trump gave an interview to the Washington Post Sunday in which he described an alternative to Obamacare that sounds pretty terrific. That \u2014 or it\u2019s a huge con that Trump isn\u2019t going to be able to keep covered up for much longer. Trump vowed that his plan would provide \u201cinsurance for everybody\u201d \u2014 unlike the Affordable Care Act, which still leaves about 25 million people without coverage. Insurance plans, he promised, would have \u201cmuch lower deductibles. \u201d And price, he said, won\u2019t be an issue.",
        "The Young Pope glances at his adversary, preternaturally long eyelashes blinking, tanned face stretching into a sneer. He takes a drag of his cigarette, ash falling on the cold marble of the Vatican floor, then he exhales and says with barely concealed disdain: \u201cThere\u2019s a new pope now. \u201d And indeed, there is.",
        "Since he was appointed to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in June 2009, Tom Frieden, the equivalent of a health official in the movie Contagion, has taken many phone calls. He\u2019s guided the agency through H1N1 swine flu, Ebola, and Zika outbreaks \u2014 just a few of the viruses that are spreading around the world faster and more effectively than ever before. With Donald Trump taking office this week, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty about how the US will handle public health and respond to potential future pandemics.",
        "New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker was trying to walk to the men\u2019s bathroom Tuesday afternoon when about 30 immigration activists surrounded him to offer their thanks. Booker had just vowed to testify against Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, a longtime immigration at the attorney general nominee\u2019s confirmation hearing \u2014 something no senator had ever done to a colleague. Progressives cheered the decision. When Booker followed through the next day and denounced Sessions\u2019s record on race, many voices were ecstatic: Applauding @CoryBooker, first sitting Senator to testify against fellow sitting Senator. Will oppose #JeffSessions. https: .",
        "It\u2019s a weird time to be PBS. On the one hand, the network was never a political football in the 2016 presidential election in the way it was in 2012, when Republican candidate Mitt Romney proposed defunding the US\u2019s only public television broadcaster. That might suggest a degree of security. On the other hand, the network has more to worry about than just an incoming Republican administration turning it into a political talking point again.",
        "Originally published on Grist. Even before the election, food luminaries had started brawling over President Obama\u2019s legacy. In a New York Times Magazine cover story, author Michael Pollan accused the administration of bowing to the demands of corporate agribusiness. \u201cThey went wobbly in the knees,\u201d former Sen. Tom Harkin said in the piece. Sam Kass, the former White House chef and food czar, fired back, saying that people like Pollan dismiss steps forward because they fall short of their \u201cidyllic\u201d vision of farming. \u201cWe are so good at turning our wins into losses, it\u2019s stunning,\u201d he said.",
        "A day before leaving office, President Barack Obama broke one of his own records. By using the president\u2019s pardon powers and shortening the prison sentences of 330 prison inmates convicted of drug crimes, he made Thursday the biggest use of clemency by a president in a single day in US history \u2014 breaking a record he himself set earlier in the week. It\u2019s the culmination of a effort to use the president\u2019s clemency power to get hundreds of people \u2014 most of them nonviolent drug offenders \u2014 out of prison sooner.",
        "More than a dozen women accused Donald Trump of sexual assault during his presidential campaign. He reacted by calling them liars and threatening to sue them. Now one of them, Summer Zervos, is suing Trump herself. Zervos, represented by Gloria Allred, a feminist attorney with a knack for the spotlight, is suing Trump for defamation, alleging that by calling her and his other accusers liars, he exposed her to threats from his supporters and damaged her reputation.",
        "As prescription prices in the US continue to skyrocket, the idea of importing cheaper drugs from Canada has gained popularity, favored by politicians as diverse as Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. Between 2 and 8 percent of Americans already turn to foreign pharmacies to save on the cost of their medications. (The practice is currently illegal, but enforcement is patchy.) And polls have long found that a majority of Americans would support legalizing drug importation from the Great White North. Last week, a proposal, by Sanders ( ) and Minnesota Democrat Amy Klobuchar, tried to do just that.",
        "In March 2009, Mara Keisling visited the White House. It was an event that has now become typical; Keisling estimates she\u2019s been in the White House dozens of times since then. But back then, it was a big deal \u2014 even historic. \u201cAs far as I know, I was the first trans person invited as a trans person to the White House,\u201d Keisling, who\u2019s the executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE) told me.",
        "When I lived and worked in Saudi Arabia as a lawyer from 2010 to 2012, I spent a lot of time waiting outside restaurants. Not because I really like food, or had a fetish for restaurant exteriors, but because I was really bad at estimating when Salat would happen. \u201cSalat\u201d is the Arabic word for the prayer time that Muslims are asked to perform five times a day. During the usual workday, Salat occurs about four times. In most countries, Salat is voluntary. Saudi Arabia is not most countries.",
        "In her first major speech outlining London\u2019s plan for shepherding the UK out of the European Union, British Prime Minister Theresa May laid out a vision for a cleaner break from Europe than many Brexit critics had hoped for. May said the UK would be leaving the European single market, the system that ensures freedom of movement, goods, services, and capital among all members of the regional bloc.",
        "Something very unusual \u2014 and unnerving \u2014 is happening on this planet of ours. The chart below shows the total extent of floating sea ice in the Earth\u2019s oceans at any given point in time. Normally it waxes and wanes with the seasons. But ever since September, as the red line shows, global sea ice has utterly collapsed, following a pattern never seen before. On January 14, total sea ice extent was at its lowest level since satellite records began in 1978 \u2014 and likely the lowest it\u2019s been for thousands of years."
