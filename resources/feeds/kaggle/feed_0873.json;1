        "As Donald Trump prepares for Friday\u2019s inauguration with historically low approval ratings, he\u2019s also preparing for an inauguration celebration that\u2019s been plagued by controversy. Since shortly after the election in November, his team has been struggling to book performers who are willing to appear at the inauguration of such a controversial president \u2014 or even performers willing to honor a prior commitment to the inauguration in the face of backlash from fans. It looks as though a lot of (and ) celebrities have strong political qualms about celebrating Trump\u2019s presidency, or think that their fans might.",
        "A striking new poll from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal finds that for the first time since 2009 or so, the American public suddenly thinks the Affordable Care Act was a \u201cgood idea. \u201d There is something a little perverse about this, but it also fits with longstanding research indicating that American public opinion operates like a thermostat: When Democrats are in the White House it shifts to the right, while when Republicans win it shifts to the left.",
        "The day after inauguration, tens of thousands of people \u2014 maybe more \u2014 led by a group of four women, are marching in Washington, DC. and around the country. Their goal, although they\u2019re not officially pitching it as such, is to send a message about women\u2019s rights that will provide a counterbalance to the political and personal values espoused by incoming President Donald J. Trump.",
        "Republicans have a problem: The promises they\u2019ve made about what their Obamacare replacement plan will do are impossible to keep. Over the weekend, Donald Trump told the Washington Post that his plan would provide \u201cinsurance for everybody\u201d with \u201cmuch lower deductibles. \u201d Oh, and don\u2019t worry about the cost. \u201cThere was a philosophy in some circles that if you can\u2019t pay for it, you don\u2019t get it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen with us. \u201d There is simply no way, within the GOP paradigm of private insurance, lower taxes, and less regulation, to make that work.",
        "As the clock ticks nearer to the day when President Trump and the Republican Congress move to repeal the Affordable Care Act, a struggle looms with a simple, elemental force that cares not for slogans, spin, or bluster \u2014 and that is the troubling arithmetic encompassed in the Republicans\u2019 expected repeal bill. More specifically, the arithmetic focuses on whether Trump and congressional Republicans will have the fiscal ability to pay for a \u201cgreat\u201d replacement to the repealed ACA.",
        "What does the American Health Care Act \u2014 the healthcare bill the House of Representatives is voting on Thursday, after weeks of negotiation and a previous failed attempt \u2014 actually do? You can answer this by talking about what\u2019s actually in the bill: it replaces Obamacare\u2019s subsidies with a flat (and overall less generous) tax credit; it overhauls and dramatically cuts Medicaid; and it allows states to get waivers from Obamacare requirements that protect people with conditions. But that\u2019s not the reason that Republicans want to pass the bill. Republicans want to pass the bill to cut taxes.",
        "I am a millionaire. The first in my family. A success. It\u2019s the story we love to tell ourselves in America about how anyone can make it. Except it\u2019s not true. The reality is that most entrepreneurs \u2014 myself included \u2014 are the product of generations of privilege that enable success. You just have to look a little deeper to see it. I was not born into wealth. Both of my parents were teachers. My dad worked an extra job making pizzas to pay the bills. My sisters and I wore clothes donated by our church.",
        "The final episode of Sherlock\u2019s fourth and probably final season arrived at last on Sunday night, appropriately titled \u201cThe Final Problem. \u201d With it, showrunners Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss, who also the episode, proposed to conclude \u201cthe story we\u2019ve been telling from the beginning.",
        "Just days before his inauguration, Donald Trump made headlines by trashing America\u2019s European allies in an interview with two of Europe\u2019s biggest newspapers. The hubbub over Trump\u2019s attack on Europe obscured one of the stranger comments in the interview \u2014 that he hoped to work with Russian strongman Vladimir Putin to reduce both countries\u2019 nuclear arsenals. \u201cLet\u2019s see if we can make some good deals with Russia,\u201d Trump said. \u201cFor one thing, I think nuclear weapons should be way down and reduced very substantially. \u201d To say this is a is an understatement.",
        "President Barack Obama has not been, at least in public, freaking out about the election of Donald Trump. If anything, his insistence on giving the a chance has frustrated many of Obama\u2019s own supporters, who were hoping to see a validation from the president that (as the catchphrase has gone) \u201cthis is not normal. \u201d They just got that moment. Kind of. During his last press conference Wednesday afternoon, Obama sent a message to \u201cDemocrats and progressives.",
        "Politics is inherently unpredictable, as the tumultuous 2016 presidential election certainly showed, and every new administration enters surrounded by a haze of Donald Rumsfeld\u2019s famous \u201cknown unknowns\u201d \u2014 questions that are clearly in play but to which the answer is, as of yet, not clear. For Donald Trump, that range of questions is larger and deeper than usual, for several reasons. One is that he comes to office backed by congressional majorities that, while not large, are quite influential given the substantial constraints that have been placed on filibustering over the past few years.",
        "Unless you\u2019ve blocked out the 2016 election from your mind, you probably remember that Donald Trump once posted this bit of gibberish: The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U. S. manufacturing . \u2014 Donald J.",
        "Twenty years ago, CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria wrote an essay in Foreign Affairs titled \u201cThe Rise of Illiberal Democracy. \u201d His thesis was that democracies around the world were surrendering to illiberal reforms, and that the strands holding the traditions of democracy and liberalism together were rapidly eroding. \u201cFrom Peru to the Palestinian Authority, from Sierra Leone to Slovakia, from Pakistan to the Philippines,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe see the rise of a disturbing phenomenon in international life \u2014 illiberal democracy. \u201d Zakaria\u2019s piece made an important distinction between democracy and liberalism, constructs that are often conflated.",
        "After more than a year of campaigning, 26 primary and general election debates, and countless press conferences, attack ads, victory speeches, public apologies, and early morning Twitter rants, Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration is here. On Friday, January 20, Trump will officially be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. Event planners are estimating that 900, 000 people will attend Trump\u2019s ceremony and the ensuing parade \u2014 about half the turnout of President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 inauguration ceremony. There\u2019s also a growing boycott among congressional Democrats; more than 50 lawmakers have said they will not attend Friday\u2019s ceremonies.",
        "Senate Democrats hit Betsy DeVos, Donald Trump\u2019s pick for education secretary, on all sides at her confirmation hearing Tuesday night. But the question that made her look worst required her to demonstrate a basic understanding of education policy \u2014 a test DeVos failed. Sen. Al Franken asked DeVos to explain her thinking on whether test scores should be used to measure students\u2019 proficiency or their growth. That\u2019s an important, and basic, difference because it affects how schools are labeled as succeeding or failing. But DeVos had no idea what Franken was talking about.",
        "There are woefully few people and institutions capable of meaningfully constraining Donald Trump. Congress won\u2019t do it; Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell have made it clear they\u2019re not interested in pressuring the on his sundry conflicts of interest or in launching investigations into Russian involvement in the election. Opportunities for resistance are limited, given the small number of states with Democratic governments.",
        "I remember the precise moment that I realized I regretted voting for Donald Trump. It was during his 60 Minutes interview after the election. I was, like everyone else, shocked that he had won. It seemed so unlikely based on the polls and the confidence the media had that he would lose. It was a pleasant surprise, and I went to bed on election night thrilled that he would be our president. But sitting on my couch, sipping coffee as I watched the interview, I saw with my own eyes who Trump really was as a person.",
        "Samantha Power, the outgoing US ambassador to the United Nations, gave her final public speech in office on Wednesday \u2014 and she devoted basically all of it to the threat Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia poses to global stability. Speaking at the Atlantic Council, Power offered what might be the simplest and clearest explanation of Putin\u2019s grand strategy I\u2019ve heard from a US official. Here it is, in one sentence: \u201cIn international affairs in 2017, it\u2019s often easier to be bad than good.",
        "One of the most iconic moments of Barack Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration celebrations came during one of that night\u2019s galas. As Barack and Michelle Obama danced together for the first time as president and first lady, Beyonc\u00e9 serenaded them with Etta James\u2019s \u201cAt Last. \u201d The moment encapsulated everything that was new and exciting about the beginning of the Obama era: the youth and cool of the first couple, their unapologetic celebration of black culture, the pervasiveness and sincerity of the optimism that surrounded them.",
        "President Barack Obama released a goodbye letter to the country on Thursday, just one day before he hands over the White House to Donald Trump. Here\u2019s Obama\u2019s letter: \u201cYou made me a better President, and you made me a better man. \u201d: President Obama pens a final goodbye letter to his fellow Americans pic. twitter. \u2014 CNN (@CNN) January 19, 2017 Obama is about to be replaced by someone who questioned the authenticity of his birth certificate, who called him \u201cthe most ignorant president in our history,\u201d a \u201cdisaster\u201d and even the \u201cfounder of ISIS.",
        "What happens when a man who now has the keys to the highest office openly mocked people with disabilities? They fight back. According to organizers of the Women\u2019s March on Washington, people with disabilities will be participating in droves, with a number expected to shatter any previous records of past rallies for people with disabilities. In 2016, disability was at the forefront of the election \u2014 unfortunately, at times, for all the wrong reasons.",
        "Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison is the frontrunner to lead the Democratic National Committee in the Trump era. Ellison has a fascinating backstory: He\u2019s the first Muslim elected to the US Congress, and he was the second member of Congress to endorse Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign. Now Sanders has returned the favor, backing Ellison to lead the DNC. But in an unexpected effort to close ranks, Sen. Chuck Schumer \u2014 who does not exactly come from Sanders\u2019s wing of the Democratic Party \u2014 has also backed Ellison. Which isn\u2019t to say Ellison doesn\u2019t face a race.",
        "Hundreds of thousands are expected to rally in Washington, DC, on Saturday for the Women\u2019s March on Washington. It\u2019s happening the day after Donald Trump\u2019s presidential inauguration, but it could be bigger than the inauguration itself. Whether you\u2019re following along at home or making the trek to DC yourself, here\u2019s what you can expect on Saturday. This post will be updated as more information comes in. The march schedule Date: Saturday, January 21, 2017 Time: The rally portion of the event, featuring speeches and musical performances, is scheduled to begin at 10 am Eastern and end at 1:15 pm.",
        "Will Donald Trump make the Cabinet great again? Recent reports suggest that once in office, the may delegate a great deal of policymaking authority to his 15 Cabinet secretaries, rather than managing things hands on or through White House staff. Trump is planning to give his Cabinet \u201cunusually wide latitude,\u201d Politico\u2019s Josh Dawsey and Andrew Restuccia reported earlier this month, citing sources close to the transition. They added that Trump\u2019s own role would likely be that of a \u201c style manager,\u201d focusing on \u201c issues, publicity and his brand.",
        "Over the past eight years, relations have taken the shape of two fearsome giants who eye each other with caution \u2014 but also consistently find more reasons to cooperate rather than clash. There have been major points of tension between the two, as the global powerhouses have traded accusations of cyber espionage and butted heads over China\u2019s land grabs in the South China Sea. But they\u2019ve also worked together on preventing a nuclear Iran and partnered against the threat of climate change.",
        "Former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman strode into room 430 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building, grinning and waving. Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, of neighboring Rhode Island, greeted him by first name. Lieberman nodded at Sen. Al Franken, the former Saturday Night Live funnyman, and said, \u201cI laugh at all his jokes. \u201d Franken shook his head, smiling. Were the moment not so fraught with high political drama, it might have felt like a college reunion.",
        "We\u2019re hearing a lot about the 22 million people who may lose their health insurance if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. But there\u2019s another, quieter tragedy that could play out if the ACA is gutted: States could lose critical funding for efforts like responding to outbreaks, vaccination programs, and and campaigns. When the ACA was enacted in 2010, the law established the Prevention and Public Health Fund, with an annual appropriation that began at $500 million in 2010.",
        "For families with disabled children, few federal laws are as important as the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, known as IDEA. It\u2019s the law that grants children with disabilities the right to attend public school. It also mandates that schools provide them with the services necessary to achieve success in that setting \u2014 in the same classrooms as kids, whenever possible. During Tuesday\u2019s confirmation hearing for Betsy DeVos, Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to run the US Department of Education, DeVos appeared to be unfamiliar with the law at the most basic level.",
        "When Rick Perry walked into his secretary of energy confirmation hearing this morning, he was all set to make a bold pitch for the Department of Energy\u2019s crucial role in supporting scientific research and developing new energy technologies. He told the Senate panel that the DOE was crucial in developing hydraulic fracturing technology, which led to a huge oil and gas boom in America. He talked about boosting research into advanced supercomputing in the agency\u2019s national labs. He touted his record in creating a Texas Emerging Technology Fund that made investments in advanced solar technology.",
        "Before NASA sends humans to Mars, it has to figure out this really, really basic problem: How do you get six or more people to live in a very confined space, on a desert, without naturally occurring oxygen, for a year, without wanting to kill one another? It\u2019s ironic: NASA can successfully launch a rocket to Mars and land it, but if the crew hates their roommates, the mission will collapse. This isn\u2019t an abstract problem. In the past, simulated space colonies have gone horribly wrong."
