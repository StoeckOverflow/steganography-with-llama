        "Electric utilities increasingly find themselves at war with their own customers. Homeowners and commercial building owners have all sorts of new choices for how to generate, store, and manage their own electricity \u2014 solar panels, home batteries, electric vehicles, smart thermostats and appliances, and more gizmos coming along every day. The more they take advantage of these new \u201cdistributed energy resources,\u201d they less power they buy from their utility. Turns out utilities don\u2019t like that!",
        "Barack Obama burst onto the national scene with a speech denying the power \u2014 denying even the reality \u2014 of the deep divisions that seemed to define American politics. \u201cThe pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states: red states for Republicans, blue states for Democrats,\u201d he said in 2004. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the blue states, and we don\u2019t like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states. \u201d His 2009 inaugural speech held to the theme.",
        "Donald Trump is officially president of the United States. A lot of people are not happy about that fact. And on Saturday, January 21, potentially hundreds of thousands plan to show their discontent in the nation\u2019s capital through the Women\u2019s March on Washington. The march may draw more attendees than Inauguration Day. As of Thursday, fewer than 400 buses had applied for parking permits on Inauguration Day \u2014 and 1, 200 buses had applied for permits the day after, when the Women\u2019s March will take place.",
        "\u201cToday is supposed to be a celebration,\u201d Barbara Queeney told me, \u201cbut instead it\u2019s just . .. crushing. \u201d Queeney, a gregarious woman from St. Augustine, Florida, was standing on the sidewalk in downtown Washington, DC, on Inauguration Day, holding a sign that read, \u201cNot Fit, Not Worthy, Not Legitimate. \u201d I asked her why she considered incoming President Donald Trump illegitimate. \u201cHe was influenced and aided by a foreign government,\u201d she told me. A few blocks away, Amy Kellash had a much different perspective on the Trump inauguration. She\u2019d traveled with her family from Gilman, Minnesota.",
        "Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, was the only Democrat with a speaking slot at Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, and he milked that opportunity for all it was worth, using his few minutes to issue a barely disguised repudiation of the man about to become president. \u201dMy fellow Americans, we live in a challenging and tumultuous time,\u201d he began, striking a nervous tone. And his examples seemed to specifically warn of dangers represented by Trump and his political coalition.",
        "Since President Jimmy Carter\u2019s inauguration in 1977, the presidential parade has become a tradition, with the newly minted president walking part of a route along Pennsylvania Avenue past supporters crowded into grandstands. But as you\u2019ll see in the photos below, the attendance Friday along the parade route for President Donald Trump was pretty sparse. Parade route from Capital to WH. Entire stands empty. Crowd thin. pic. twitter. \u2014 Katy Tur (@KatyTurNBC) January 20, 2017 Reuters also captured empty stands elsewhere along the route.",
        "As soon as Donald Trump was sworn in as president, the official White House website \u2014 WhiteHouse. gov \u2014 got a speedy makeover to reflect the change in administration, as had long been planned. Gone is the Obama White House\u2019s page on climate change, which is now archived here for posterity (along with virtually everything else from the website).",
        "President Donald Trump boasted his inauguration would have an \u201dunbelievable, perhaps turnout.\u201d But aerial shots of the National Mall from President Barack Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration and today show that isn\u2019t likely. Here\u2019s an image taken at about 11:30 AM ET in 2009: And here\u2019s what it looks like today as of 11:04 AM ET. And here they are : Federal and local agencies have estimated that anywhere from 700, 000 to 900, 000 people will be in Washington, DC, today for Trump\u2019s inauguration. That\u2019s roughly half the number of people who attended Obama\u2019s inauguration in 2009.",
        "\u201cFear is preventing you from investing in yourself,\u201d according to one script used by salesmen at Trump University, unsealed as a result of civil litigation. \u201cI find it very difficult to believe that you\u2019ll invest in anything else if you don\u2019t believe enough to invest in yourself and your education. \u201d It was, apparently, a pretty good sales pitch.",
        "Through an incredibly fortuitous historical coincidence, the World Economic Forum \u2014 the premier confab of the global political and economic elite \u2014 is happening on the same day that Donald Trump is taking office in the United States. The dispatches from Davos, Switzerland (where the forum takes place) make it sound like a place of barely concealed panic.",
        "When Hillary Clinton showed up to the inauguration of her former rival Donald Trump on Friday, her outfit made a striking statement. She wore an suit \u2014 making a reference to the women\u2019s suffrage movement. It\u2019s an especially striking choice on the eve of the Women\u2019s March on Washington, which promises to draw massive crowds of people aiming to remind Trump of the importance of a famous Clinton quote: \u201cWomen\u2019s rights are human rights.",
        "On the last day of his presidency, President Obama is preparing to hand over the keys to the official @POTUS Twitter account and White House website (as well as the nuclear codes, Air Force One, and just about everything else). But on his way out the door, he unveiled Obama. org, the website for his presidential center, a \u201cliving, working center for citizenship\u201d on the South Side of Chicago. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said many times before, true democracy is a project that\u2019s much bigger than any one of us,\u201d Obama said in a video announcing the project.",
        "George W. Bush won the 2004 election. He won it by more than the pundits expected. He won it by enough to keep Republicans in control of the House and the Senate. He won it by enough to say, with real reason, \u201cI earned capital in this campaign, political capital, and now I intend to spend it. \u201d He began his second term with a 57 percent approval rating. Two years later, Republicans lost the House and Senate. Four years later, they lost the presidency. Bush left office with a 34 percent approval rating.",
        "Barack Obama fills whatever space you put him in. Make him president, and he\u2019ll seem presidential. Make him a law professor, and he\u2019ll seem professorial. In some other universe, there\u2019s probably some alternate version of Obama who became a novelist and is widely regarded as one of America\u2019s foremost men of letters. This is not to say Obama is multitalented \u2014 though he is \u2014 but rather that he boasts the ability to make himself seem like a natural fit for wherever he ends up.",
        "On Inauguration Day, Donald Trump will be sworn in as the president of the United States with the lowest approval rating for any incoming president in the modern era. So we want to know: How are you feeling about it? Submit up to five emotions, and we\u2019ll tell you the most common emotion other readers are feeling, as well as how many other people are feeling the way you do. We\u2019ll also grid all the collective feels by their level of happiness and intensity after you submit.",
        "It takes a certain type of individual to run for office these days \u2014 one who enjoys the limelight. But what does this age mean for the political spouse, especially for one new to the political world, like Melania Trump? We know very little about Melania, and already much has been made of her decision not to move into the White House this month.",
        "A beloved TV show doesn\u2019t just become a favorite work of art. It becomes a literal part of your life, weaving its way into the fabric of everything else going on for you at that point in your personal timeline. That\u2019s why some TV shows \u2014 through no fault of their own \u2014 become almost inextricably tied to certain presidential administrations. Their lives eerily parallel said administrations, and they explore themes that are particularly raw during that specific moment in American history.",
        "On Saturday, President Donald Trump excoriated the media for \u2014 in his view \u2014 massively understating the size of his inaugural crowds. \u201cI turn on one of the networks, and they show an empty field,\u201d Trump said at a speech Saturday afternoon at the CIA. \u201cI\u2019m like, wait a minute. I made a speech. I looked out, the field was, it looked like a million, million and a half people. \u201d The unnamed television network, he noted, estimated a turnout of 250, 000 people \u2014 a figure he argued was way too low. \u201cNow, that\u2019s not bad.",
        "\u201cWhat are they doing out there?\u201d \u201cWhat do they want?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s their goal?\u201d If there\u2019s a protest or demonstration, you can count on an observer asking these questions from the sidelines. And, to be fair, the answer is less than obvious when tens of thousands of diverse people have gathered, with signs, chants, and group memberships that cover a wide range of issues. That\u2019s already been the case for the Women\u2019s March on Washington, taking place in Washington, DC, on Saturday.",
        "It started with a small idea on Facebook, born out of despair after the election \u2014 a group of women marching to protest the presidency of Donald Trump. Soon, the idea of a women\u2019s protest ballooned through social media channels into a viral event with thousands expected to descend on Washington, DC, the day after inauguration. Organizing the protest got off to a shaky start.",
        "The process of making America great again will start with a bang. Donald Trump reportedly told Fox News\u2019s Andrew Napolitano that he plans to issue as many as 200 executive orders by the Monday after his inauguration. While plans are still somewhat up in the air, we have a pretty good idea from Trump\u2019s prior public statements and plans, and the behavior of past Republican presidents, as to what they might be.",
        "Shortly after the end of his inaugural parade, President Donald Trump issued his first executive order: instructions for the federal government to dismantle the Affordable Care Act \u201cto the maximum extent permitted by law. \u201d The executive order is a powerful political statement about the health care law, one that directs agencies to \u201cwaive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay\u201d any taxes or penalties they possibly can. The order doesn\u2019t give Trump any new powers, but does suggest that he wants to move quickly on dismantling major parts of the health overhaul.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign led to fresh attention to a related landmark moment in US history: the ratification of the 19th Amendment, in 1920, granting women the right to vote. Election Day saw a steady flow of pilgrims to the gravesite of suffrage leader Susan B. Anthony. Observers have noted that the white pant suits Clinton wore at key moments in the campaign \u2014 and, later, on Inauguration Day \u2014 evoke the white dresses worn by suffrage activists. Clinton ultimately failed to crack the highest glass ceiling.",
        "Speaking at the CIA this afternoon, President Donald Trump said, \u201cI have a running war with the media. \u201d Like much that Trump says, this isn\u2019t quite true. His war isn\u2019t with the media. Trump lives off media attention and delights in press coverage. His war is with facts. And it\u2019s there that his tactical skirmishes with the press begin to make sense. Delegitimizing the media is important to Trump because delegitimizing certain facts is important to Trump.",
        "Perhaps as big as the actual inauguration of Donald Trump may be the protests surrounding the ceremony. As a National Park Service spokesperson told the New York Times, in a typical election cycle the agency gets four or five protest permit applications for Washington, DC. This year, the number of applications is at least 20. So just what are the protests about? It really varies: Most are against Trump, but some support him. Some support abortion rights, while one is explicitly against them. Some are socialist. Some are focused on racial justice. One is even focused on marijuana.",
        "The 2017 Sundance Film Festival opened on January 19 and runs through January 29. Alissa Wilkinson is on the ground in Park City, Utah, from January 19 to 25, and we\u2019ll be running festival diaries those days with capsule reviews and reflections on the day\u2019s films. The second day of Sundance was stacked with movies about the mental states of women living in constricting systems that aren\u2019t quite their own making. One takes place in Scotland. One is set in an American convent in the 1960s. And one is caught in the web of social media circa 2017.",
        "There were two protests that took place in Washington, DC, on Saturday, both under the banner of the Women\u2019s March on Washington. One was headlined by Angela Davis and Gloria Steinem; the Indigo Girls and Toshi Reagon; Alicia Keys and Ashley Judd. The other was a messy, glorious, wildly unstructured of families and singletons, millennials and octogenarians, all there to take a stand for women\u2019s rights, in whatever form that took. They waved banners and sang songs. They began chants.",
        "Under President Barack Obama, the Federal Communication Commission passed regulations that provided strong legal protections for network neutrality. These rules, which were strongly opposed by telecommunications giants such as Comcast and Verizon, were designed to create a level playing field for online companies. Now Donald Trump has taken the first step toward gutting those regulations: He has named Ajit Pai to be the next chair of the FCC. Pai has served as a Republican member of the FCC since 2012. He\u2019s known for his deregulatory views generally and his opposition to network neutrality in particular.",
        "Every previous winning presidential candidate \u2014 and a good number of losing ones like John McCain and John Kerry \u2014 have been popular. Even Bill Clinton, who kind of limped into office with 43 percent of the popular vote in 1992, enjoyed approval ratings in the 60s during his winter. Donald Trump is not like that. While Barack Obama won the votes of a decent number of people who also had a favorable impression of McCain, Trump triumphed in the face of a badly divided opposition.",
        "Nobody knows what to make of the Trump executive order, not even Senate Republicans \u2014 About 72 hours ago, President Donald Trump issued his first executive order: one that directed agencies to do everything \u201cto the maximum extent permitted by law\u201d to waive and delay Obamacare fees and regulation. Key players in the Affordable Care Act debate are still struggling to make heads or tails of what it actually means. This is what Sen."
