        "Now that he\u2019s president, Donald Trump is laying the groundwork to drastically reshape the Environmental Protection Agency in the weeks and months ahead. All signs indicate that Trump will soon issue a flurry of executive orders as part of the process of weakening various air and water pollution rules and cutting agency budgets. It\u2019s all part of his plan to dismantle President Obama\u2019s climate policies and make life easier for America\u2019s fossil fuel industry.",
        "When it comes to predicting the 2017 Oscar nominees, most of the categories follow the same pattern. (The nominees are announced at 8:18 am Eastern on Tuesday, January 24.) There are always two or three locks. Then there\u2019s at least one more that looks pretty solid. And then the fight for the last spot is absolute pandemonium, with seemingly hundreds of different potential nominees having a viable shot. But the fact that there are so many names competing for so few nods makes it almost even more exciting.",
        "Donald Trump is walking the walk: His first executive order during his first full working day as president was to withdraw from the negotiations process over the Partnership, the gargantuan free trade agreement that he\u2019d railed against on the campaign trail as a job killer and promised to do away with. The move fulfills one of Trump\u2019s signature campaign pledges to get out of the sweeping trade deal, which he once deemed \u201da rape of our country,\u201d and marks a major blow to the Washington consensus on free trade.",
        "President Donald Trump reinstated \u2014 and massively expanded \u2014 an executive order Monday barring US foreign aid from going to any nongovernmental organization (NGO) that either provides abortion services, or even discusses abortion with its patients as an option for family planning. Trump has promised to take sweeping actions against abortion, including appointing Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade. Reinstating and expanding the global gag rule is the first indication of how serious he is.",
        "Replication has emerged as a powerful tool to check science and get us closer to the truth. Researchers take an experiment that\u2019s already been done, and test whether its conclusions hold up by reproducing it. The general principle is that if the results repeat, then the original results were correct and reliable. If they don\u2019t, then the first study must be flawed, or its findings false. But there\u2019s a big wrinkle with replication studies: They don\u2019t work like that.",
        "Recent political events \u2014 Brexit, the election of Donald Trump \u2014 have majorly shaken up world order. The future is now looking pretty uncertain. But it\u2019s not so bad! We human beings are lucky. For most other species of primate \u2014 the branch of mammals we belong to \u2014 the future is far, far more uncertain. For most primates, there may be no future. A new report in Science Advances finds around 60 percent of primate species are threatened with extinction, all due to the actions of, well, us.",
        "The most inexperienced president in American history has officially been sworn in. In the office\u2019s storied existence \u2014 from George Washington to Barack Obama \u2014 there has never been a president who has entirely lacked both political and military service. Donald Trump has broken this barrier. I went through historical presidential archives and manually compiled each president\u2019s total years of service to the country prior to being elected. I define \u201cpublic office\u201d as any elected or appointed government position and \u201cmilitary service\u201d as active duty in any capacity, including leadership positions.",
        "The Women\u2019s March on Washington drew at least 500, 000 people to the streets of Washington, DC on Saturday \u2014 a crowd roughly three times bigger than the audience at Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration the day before, crowd scientists told the New York Times. Nationwide, the Women\u2019s March may have been the largest demonstration in US history, with at least 3. 3 million people attending marches in more than 500 cities. Organizers said the event was a march for women\u2019s rights, not a protest against Trump.",
        "You probably know how it feels to be in pain. But have you ever wondered how a dog or cat feels pain? Or a fish? An octopus? In a new video, evolutionary biologist Robyn J. Crook provided some insight into what we know about this issue. Of course, we can\u2019t ever know for sure, since we can\u2019t (yet) read animals\u2019 minds. But there are some things we can infer from the science of pain. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we find out,\u201d Crook argued. \u201cWe keep animals as pets. They enrich our environment. We farm many species for food.",
        "Deepak Chopra is a fraud. This is what I was thinking as I lingered 20 rows back, waiting for Bree, my boss, to finish huddling with Deepak onstage about the presentation he would give that evening. Bree ran the San Francisco chapter of The Learning Annex, that mainstay of adult education courses for the set. This was the \u201990s, when people still called the New Age movement \u201cthe New Age movement. \u201d Deepak was our big get that season.",
        "In an interview with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos that seems to have flown a bit under the radar, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said the president may stop enforcing Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate that requires nearly all Americans to carry health coverage. Here\u2019s the exchange: STEPHANOPOULOS: I do want to get to a question on Obamacare. You had the president\u2019s executive order signed on [Friday]. And a lot of people were trying to figure on Friday, a lot of people trying to figure out what exactly does that mean?",
        "Days after the Women\u2019s March on Washington, the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress launched attacks on public funding for women\u2019s health care. On Monday, President Trump reinstated the global gag rule, which strips all US funding from foreign aid groups that counsel patients on abortion. Rather than decrease abortion rates, the move is likely to increase them, devastate the global health system in the process, and leave millions of women across the globe without access to either safe abortion or contraception.",
        "Donald Trump is reportedly close to making what will be one of the biggest decisions of his entire presidency: choosing a replacement for late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Trump is now saying he will announce a pick next week. After Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell successfully obstructed President Obama\u2019s nominee, Merrick Garland, for nearly a year, the Court is still short a member, a vacancy that Trump and his allies in the Senate are eager to fill quickly. In May, Trump released a list of 11 possible choices for the slot, before adding 10 more in September.",
        "The 2017 Oscars, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, will be awarded Sunday, February 26, with the ceremony airing live at 8:30 pm Eastern on ABC. The awards are considered the most prestigious honor in the film industry. La La Land is the frontrunner this year and the favorite to take home Best Picture. The movie is nominated 14 times in 13 categories, which means it now shares the record for most Oscar nominations for a single film \u2014 1997\u2019s Titanic and 1950\u2019s All About Eve also earned 14 nods at their respective Oscars.",
        "The first week of President Donald Trump\u2019s new administration started with a lawsuit claiming he\u2019s already violated the Constitution. The lawsuit, filed by a collection of ethics experts and legal scholars, argues that because Trump has refused to give up ownership of his hotels and other businesses, he\u2019s violating a clause of the Constitution that prohibits government officials from accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments.",
        "Donald Trump made a lot of promises on the campaign trail about what he\u2019d do on day one of his presidency. Now day one is over \u2014 and after the first full weekday of the Trump administration, what Trump hasn\u2019t done is just as notable as what he has. Trump\u2019s first round of executive orders were surprisingly consistent with what you might see from any other Republican president: a splashy but vague order on implementing Obamacare, a federal hiring freeze, and a reinstatement of the \u201cglobal gag rule,\u201d an funding rule that\u2019s existed under past Republican administrations.",
        "On Tuesday, President Trump signed two executive orders intended to revive the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines \u2014 two controversial oil projects that had been halted under President Obama after years of grassroots protest and fierce opposition from climate activists. While nothing\u2019s final until the pipelines are actually built, these orders make approval much more likely. Trump has made supporting the oil and gas industry a key priority of his presidency, and this is his first big policy move toward that end.",
        "\u201cThis was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period. Both in person and around the globe. \u201d The new White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, introduced himself to the American people this weekend with these words \u2014 words that came after a series of tendentious factual claims about attendance at President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration and that made a remarkable contrast with readily available photographic evidence. Spicer\u2019s statement made for a jarring introduction to the new Trump administration, and he came in for a good deal of condemnation from reporters and mockery from observers of all political stripes.",
        "The 89th annual Academy Award nominations are in \u2014 and they\u2019re about what you\u2019d expect: some good nominations here, some surprise snubs there, two random nominations for the truly awful Passengers way over there. (Granted, both of those Passengers nominations \u2014 Production Design and Original Score \u2014 are for the film\u2019s technical elements, but still. That movie should be jettisoned into space.) Related Here\u2019s the complete list of 2017 Oscar nominees Overall, though, it\u2019s a good list, one that showcases the breadth and diversity of films made in 2016.",
        "Politically speaking, there was no debate on United States international trade agreements in 2016: All politicians seeking to win a national election, or even to create a political coalition, agree that our trade agreements are bad things. From the left, we had Democratic presidential primary Bernie Sanders \u2014 and a remarkably close he was \u2014 slamming trade. From the \u2014 I do not think it\u2019s wrong but it\u2019s not quite correct to call it \u201cright,\u201d at least not as Americans have hitherto understood what \u201cright\u201d is \u2014 but from somewhere, we had Donald Trump.",
        "Back in November, I was not convinced I wanted to attend the Women\u2019s March on Washington. I voted for Hillary Clinton, but I had complex feelings about what my motivations for going to the march would be, especially as it was then being organized by white women. Several of the black feminists I follow on Twitter expressed concern about whether the march would include and amplify black, brown, trans, indigenous, disabled, and queer women\u2019s voices. Cut to last week. A colleague sent me a profile of the march\u2019s organizers, and I was heartened by what I saw.",
        "Writer Julia Hahn drives immigration coverage on Breitbart \u2014 an site that helped shape the Trump campaign\u2019s policies and messaging on immigration. Unlike most immigration reporters, Breitbart doesn\u2019t approach the beat through the lens of domestic policy so much as through the lens of crime \u2014 painting a bleak and downright scary (and often untrue) picture of immigrants. Hahn is expected to take a job in the White House under top Trump adviser Stephen Bannon, a former Breitbart executive who is now a chief strategist in the White House.",
        "Two Republican senators are pitching an Affordable Care Act replacement that they hope will appeal to the law\u2019s supporters. States that like Obamacare, they argue, should get to keep it. Sens. Bill Cassidy ( ) and Susan Collins ( ) held a press conference Monday to roll out the Patient Freedom Act. They propose giving states three options: Keep Obamacare, switch to a different insurance expansion, or go forward with no coverage expansion at all. \u201cCalifornia and New York, you like Obamacare, you should keep it,\u201d Cassidy said at the press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s not for us to dictate.",
        "Donald Trump keeps talking about how he wants to rebuild America\u2019s roads, bridges, and other infrastructure. Now Senate Democrats are signaling that they\u2019d be happy to work with him on this \u2014 only they have very different ideas on how to go about it. On Tuesday, Democrats led by Sen. Chuck Schumer ( ) unveiled a proposal to spend $1 trillion over the next 10 years to repair old bridges and roads, expand bus and rail systems, modernize ports, highways, airports, schools, grids, and much, much more. Unlike Trump\u2019s plan, this would be accomplished through direct federal spending.",
        "Donald Trump is poised to put \u201cdealmaking\u201d at the center of the presidential economic policy making tool kit. Even before taking office, the has claimed to save thousands of jobs by cajoling companies into keeping jobs in the United States. Outside of concerns about the sustainability of such deals, just how much of a change would such deals bring to the US labor market? How many of these deals would Trump have to make to significantly improve the jobs situation in the United States?",
        "When President Donald Trump and his surrogates said the media lied about how many people were at his inauguration, it was easy to tell our readers it was absurd. There were pictures that showed he was wrong \u2014 and virtually everyone who attended both events could attest to it. But here\u2019s the potential future scenario that worries me: The Bureau of Labor Statistics announces its monthly data showing unemployed rates \u2014 and Trump and his surrogates say it\u2019s wrong.",
        "On Tuesday, Vox was given six documents that purported to be draft executive orders under consideration by the Trump administration. The source noted that \u201call of these documents are still going through formal review\u201d in the Executive Office of the President and \u201chave not yet been cleared by [the Department of Justice or the Office of Legal Counsel]. \u201d We were not, at the time, able to verify the authenticity of the documents and did not feel it would be reasonable to publish or report on them.",
        "On Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed a pair of executive orders that constitute the biggest change to federal immigration policy in a single day in recent memory. Trump signed an order that directs the Department of Homeland Security to begin construction on a wall between the US and Mexico \u2014 while cracking down on people who cross the border now, many of whom are children and families seeking asylum from Central America.",
        "On Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed an executive orders building up security on the border \u2014 including directing money to start building his famous wall \u2014 and increasing immigration enforcement within the interior. The following link explains the Wednesday executive orders: Related The wall is the least aggressive part of Trump\u2019s executive actions on immigration Later this week, he\u2019s expected to sign an order imiting legal immigration to the US for refugees fleeing persecution and from several countries. Details about the forthcoming executive orders are still unconfirmed. But here\u2019s what we can say with high confidence.",
        "Late Tuesday night, 11 Senate Democrats joined the Republicans on the banking committee to unanimously approve Ben Carson\u2019s nomination as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Even darlings of the progressive left like Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown voted yes on Carson. Many progressives were outraged. Carson has never run a federal agency, seems unaware of basic details on housing policy, and says he wants to weaken laws that combat housing segregation. Judd Legum, editor of the blog ThinkProgress, shared a headline blasting turncoat Democrats titled \u201cWTF\u201d and captioned it in all caps. 8."
