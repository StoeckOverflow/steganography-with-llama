        "Every year, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) the research arm of the company that publishes the Economist magazine, issues a report assessing the state of democracy in countries around the world. This year\u2019s report, released on Wednesday morning, has a striking finding: The United States has, for the first time, been rated as a \u201cflawed\u201d rather than \u201cfull\u201d democracy. You\u2019d think, given the timing, that the election of Donald Trump is the reason why. But that\u2019s not it. The report is based on a quantitative metric, linked to survey data and policy, that doesn\u2019t incorporate the election results.",
        "Mary Tyler Moore, the entertainment industry legend best known for starring in the landmark sitcom The Mary Tyler Moore Show, has died at the age of 80, according to the actress\u2019s publicist. Moore was a prolific performer. She began her career on the Broadway stage, before being plucked to star in The Dick Van Dyke Show in 1961. She became a TV mainstay in the \u201960s and \u201970s, a Emmy winner and sitcom staple. Later, she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her turn as a grieving mother in 1980\u2019s Ordinary People.",
        "During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump vowed to bring back torture, including both waterboarding and techniques that were \u201ca hell of a lot worse. \u201d And on Wednesday, a draft executive order leaked that, if issued, could clear the way for the CIA to brutally interrogate terror suspects in secret prisons around the globe.",
        "This is a tense moment for science in America, now that a president who is skeptical of proven ideas like climate change and vaccine safety is in office. Donald Trump once called the National Institutes of Health \u2014 a research facility that has saved millions of lives \u2014 \u201cterrible. \u201d When Trump assumed command of the federal government on Friday, he inherited thousands of civil servants who produce critically important research on disease threats, natural disasters, climate change, and so much more. This week, there are already several reports out that suggest major changes could be afoot.",
        "Mary Tyler Moore has died at age 80, but her television legacy will never be forgotten. In particular, her ability to coax a laugh from anyone and everyone was undeniable. Perhaps the greatest example of Moore\u2019s indomitable comedic talent is the legendary \u201cChuckles Bites the Dust\u201d episode of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, which aired during the series\u2019 sixth season in 1975. The gist: Chuckles the Clown was a character on the news station where Mary Richards (Moore) worked.",
        "White House counselor Kellyanne Conway coined a new term this weekend: \u201calternative facts. \u201d And the dictionary, a authority on English language use, had to weigh in. Conway claimed in a television appearance last Sunday that the new White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, was merely presenting \u201calternative facts\u201d when he said the crowd at Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration \u201cwas the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period. Both in person and around the globe. \u201d According to \u201cLookups for \u2019fact\u2019 spiked after Kellyanne Conway described false statements as \u2019alternative facts\u2019.",
        "President Donald Trump just can\u2019t stop talking about voter fraud. In a meeting with senators on Thursday, participants told Politico that Trump ranted as former New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte was in the room about how she would have won her reelection in November if \u201cthousands\u201d of people weren\u2019t \u201cbrought in on buses\u201d from Massachusetts to New Hampshire to vote \u201cillegally. \u201d Like other Trump conspiracy theories about voter fraud, there is zero evidence for his claim.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s election may have inspired a birth control boom. Intrauterine device (IUD) prescriptions and procedures increased 19 percent between October and December of this year, according to a data set compiled by analysts for the electronic health record AthenaHealth. No similar pattern was observed at the end of 2015. In the wake of Trump\u2019s surprise electoral victory, social media was replete with anecdotes of women worried about the possible repeal of Obamacare\u2019s birth control mandate \u2014 and rushed to the doctor to get IUDs, one of the most effective reversible contraceptives.",
        "About two and a half months ago, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi embarked on a radical experiment, pulling 86 percent of India\u2019s cash out of circulation overnight in a bid to take on corruption. The sudden move threw the country\u2019s mostly economy into total chaos, and tens of thousands of people took to the streets across India to protest. The prime minister argued that while people might face temporary hardship, in the longer run the benefits to the economy would far outweigh the costs.",
        "It seems Ben Affleck is struggling to figure out what to do with himself as an actor. In this month\u2019s Live by Night, which he also wrote, directed, and produced, Affleck stars as Joe Coughlin, an Irish veteran embittered by his experience fighting World War I. Coughlin no longer believes in right and wrong, or the legitimacy of any system or authority, and so he has turned to crime in his \u2014 and Affleck\u2019s \u2014 hometown of Boston. Still, Coughlin refuses to join the local mobs, which he believes are engaged in another pointless war.",
        "I am a robot, programmed to obliterate my list. During the day, I direct a research laboratory, write papers, and teach classes as a professor of psychology at the University of Arizona. Come 4:30 pm, I run a kid limousine service, shuttling between various activities, preparing dinner, helping with homework and the evening routine. I scurry through these activities \u2014 often missing the moments of joy embedded in everyday life \u2014 until I have some sort of nightly electrical shortage, then crash out on the couch. I reboot in the morning and do it all again.",
        "On the same day that President Donald Trump signed an executive order that would make many, if not most, unauthorized immigrants living in the United States priorities for deportation, he took pains to reassure one group of unauthorized immigrants: unauthorized immigrants who\u2019ve been protected from deportation by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program created by President Obama. \u201dWe\u2019re going to take care of everybody,\u201d Trump told ABC News\u2019s David Muir on Wednesday.",
        "It\u2019s safe to say there\u2019s an enormous amount of panic \u2014 and confusion \u2014 about what\u2019s going on with the Trump administration and the Environmental Protection Agency right now. Over the past few days, we\u2019ve seen reports that Trump\u2019s team ordered EPA employees not to speak to the press or use social media for a period of time. They\u2019ve imposed a (temporary) freeze on new grants and contracts.",
        "President Donald Trump has tweeted about his inauguration crowd size, he spoke about it in a meeting with the CIA in front of a memorial wall for fallen agents, and he sent his press secretary to make false claims about the ceremony\u2019s turnout on his first full day in office. Despite all that, Trump rejects the notion that he\u2019s focusing on his popularity \u2014 it\u2019s the media that \u201ckeeps bringing it up. \u201d Unsurprisingly, he talked about it at length Wednesday night during his first interview from the White House with ABC\u2019s David Muir.",
        "Mary Tyler Moore died on January 25, leaving behind a rich legacy of television that wouldn\u2019t be the same \u2014 or possibly exist at all \u2014 without her influence. The Mary Tyler Moore Show, which Moore produced with her husband and business partner Grant Tinker, was more than just a TV series. Moore played a single woman with a demanding journalism job \u2014 a role that, when the show debuted in 1970, stood as a strong rebuke of traditional sitcom gender roles.",
        "President Trump\u2019s Wednesday night interview with ABC\u2019s David Muir suggested a very simple explanation of why he continues to make outrageous and false claims about voter fraud and crowd sizes: motivated reasoning. This is the lens through which Trump\u2019s repeated, easily disproven claims make sense. Trump believes that he\u2019s a popular president, swept into office in a popular uprising, with a strong mandate. He starts with that belief and works backward. He fabricates claims to support it.",
        "Donald Trump has accused Democrats of working to undermine the legitimacy of his presidency, but he should look somewhere else: to the faceless bureaucrats leaking drafts of his executive orders and the West Wing staffers sharing hugely embarrassing information about him. In the past two days alone, government sources gave reporters drafts of executive orders that would gut US contributions to international organizations like the United Nations, potentially pave the way for the CIA to once again torture terror suspects, start the process of building Trump\u2019s wall, and make it easier to arrest and deport undocumented immigrants.",
        "Broody teens, dark secrets, melodramatic school dances, supernaturally hot people breaking each other\u2019s hearts for as far as the eye can see: This is the teen soap way. And no show on the air right now knows that better than The CW\u2019s Riverdale. The new teen drama \u2014 which you may have heard discussed in recent weeks as \u201cthat sexy Archie Comics show\u201d \u2014 is a 2017 update of the Archie comic books that prizes nefarious murder mysteries and washboard abs over wholesome stories about football games and battles of the bands.",
        "In August 2008, the Census Bureau released a report that predicted a seismic shift in American demographics: By 2050, minorities would make up more than 50 percent of the population and become the majority. When Yale psychologist Jennifer Richeson heard about the report on NPR, she remembers thinking, \u201cThis is probably freaking somebody out. \u201d By \u201csomebody,\u201d she means white people. Richeson\u2019s studies on interracial interactions had taught her that when people are in the majority, the sense of their race is dormant.",
        "During his inauguration address on Friday, Donald Trump released an image that had nothing to do with crowd size or marchers: his official White House portrait. The picture, which features prominently in the White House website\u2019s biography of Trump, depicts the president in front of what appears to be a image of the White House. In his characteristic red tie, Trump leans forward, no smile, with an aggressive \u2014 arguably menacing \u2014 stare. The image struck us as unusual, so we reached out to some professional photographers and presidential scholars to help us unpack why.",
        "Every administration has, from time to time, sought to mislead the public about something or other. But Donald Trump\u2019s administration already stands out for the frequency of misleading statements, their baldfacedness, and the at times absurd content. Anyone might try to exaggerate the degree to which the president deserves credit for good economic news while averting blame for bad news. But to send out a White House press secretary with bad Metro ridership numbers and spin that directly contradicts clear photographic evidence about crowd size is insane.",
        "Over the past week, liberals on social media have taken on an unusual debate: Is it okay to punch white nationalist Richard Spencer in the face? The discussion came shortly after Spencer was actually punched in the face on camera by a protester during Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. Shortly before he was punched, Spencer denied that he was a and said, \u201cYeah, sure,\u201d when asked if he liked black people. Then a man approached Spencer off camera and attacked him.",
        "In the months since President Donald Trump won on Election Day, Trump has continued his unusual habit of questioning the legitimacy of his own election \u2014 claiming that he would have won the popular vote if \u201cmillions of people\u201d hadn\u2019t voted illegally, and now calling for an investigation into voter fraud, even though reputable studies have found voter fraud is nearly nonexistent in the US. What\u2019s the basis for all of this?",
        "On Friday, President Donald Trump overhauled US refugee policy \u2014 laying the groundwork for a fundamental shift in how the US allows people to enter the country. Trump signed an executive order Friday afternoon that bans all immigrants and visa holders from seven countries from entering the US for 90 days, and opens the door to more bans in future. It also bans all refugee admissions for 120 days \u2014 and bans Syrian refugees indefinitely.",
        "As liberals prepare to fight back against Donald Trump and his nascent administration, they are swiftly finding reasons to be disappointed in the elected leadership of the Democratic Party. Liberal senators like Sherrod Brown and Elizabeth Warren are voting to confirm Ben Carson as secretary of housing and urban development, outraging grassroots progressives. Ben Carson openly said that he was against constitutional rights for Muslims and Dems are voting him in.",
        "When congressional Republicans went off to Philadelphia for a retreat this week, they hoped to make at least some progress toward a consensus about how to proceed with repealing and replacing Obamacare. However, secret recordings of discussions at the retreat obtained by the Washington Post\u2019s Mike DeBonis reveal that the party remains divided, uncertain, and deeply concerned about how to move forward. It\u2019s long been clear that there are a great many unsettled questions regarding the legislative and policy details of the GOP\u2019s repeal effort. These include: How quickly should repeal go into effect?",
        "On Thursday morning, the Washington Post published a piece with an explosive headline: \u201cThe State Department\u2019s entire senior management team just resigned. \u201d The piece alleged that Undersecretary for Management Patrick Kennedy, one of the top officials the department, and three of his deputies had left their jobs because they didn\u2019t want to serve in the Trump administration. \u201cThe entire senior level of management officials resigned Wednesday, part of an ongoing mass exodus of senior foreign service officers who don\u2019t want to stick around for the Trump era,\u201d Josh Rogin, the story\u2019s author, wrote.",
        "I\u2019ve been studying public opinion on abortion for the past few years. A central finding is that voter support for women\u2019s rights on abortion is steady, if not increasing. A majority (64 percent) wants abortion legal in all or most cases. Seven in 10 agree with the Roe v. Wade decision. oppose nominating a Supreme Court justice based on beliefs. This week, however, President Trump and the overwhelmingly male Republican leadership in Congress proposed several pieces of legislation to reduce abortion access and rights.",
        "Friday, January 27, is International Holocaust Remembrance Day. It may also become the day President Donald Trump signs an executive order banning all refugees from entering the US for four months, and banning Syrian refugees indefinitely \u2014 along with any other refugees from countries that the federal government decides don\u2019t have \u201csufficient safeguards\u201d in place. The coincidence is particularly painful for anyone familiar with a dark chapter in US refugee history. The US turned down multiple opportunities to help Jews fleeing Nazi Germany in the to the Holocaust.",
        "Religious topics aren\u2019t foreign territory for Sundance movies. Maybe that\u2019s because independent filmmakers have the freedom to explore religious topics with more nuance and even irreverence than the traditional studio system is ready to risk. And the 2017 Sundance Film Festival has its share of obviously religiously oriented films, including not one, but two about nuns \u2014 the transgressive comedy The Little Hours and the more contemplative drama Novitiate. Two others, though, came in from a different angle, by exploring territory most commonly linked with religion: the afterlife."
