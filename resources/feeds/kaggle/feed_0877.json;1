        "Let\u2019s be clear: Donald Trump is not proposing to raise the price of your avocados in order to pay for a border wall. Well, not right now, anyway. Who knows what he\u2019ll say tomorrow. The fact that this matter is even in question is a testament to the haphazard and confusing way the Trump administration has decided to make major policy announcements.",
        "In recent years, mass incarceration\u2019s cost has typically been estimated to be in the ballpark of around $80 billion a year. Federal, state, and local lawmakers have long criticized the price tag as too high, touting it as a key rationale for cutting the massive jail and prison population that has made America the world\u2019s leader in incarceration. A new report from the Prison Policy Initiative, however, has bad news: That $80 billion number is an underestimate.",
        "President Donald Trump has now been in office for two weeks. So it\u2019s a good moment to take a step back from the controversies of the moment and look at what, concretely, the Trump administration has done so far. In doing so, let\u2019s set aside the many plans for action, rumored policy changes, and discussions about possible legislation for the moment. Presidents say a lot of things, but what\u2019s most important and revealing is what they actually do. And Trump has already made important changes to US policy \u2014 some major, and some minor.",
        "The first week of the Trump administration was already full of tension at many federal agencies, where transition uncertainties and new communication and funding directives made scientists fear their work could be suppressed or even canceled by politicians. But scientists are already mobilizing \u2014 and fast. \u201cScientists worldwide have been alarmed by the clear actions taken by the Trump administration,\u201d Caroline Weinberg, an organizer of an upcoming \u201cScientists\u2019 March on Washington,\u201d told Vox in an email. The exact details of the march \u2014 specifically when it will occur \u2014 have not been set.",
        "Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania recently surveyed 426 primary care physicians about whether Obamacare should be repealed. The majority of the doctors who voted for Trump, somewhat surprisingly, said it shouldn\u2019t be. Generally, primary care doctors were less favorable to repeal than the wider population \u2014 only 15 percent supported getting rid of the law. Researchers David Grande and Craig Pollack found that just 38 percent of primary care doctors who voted for Trump want him to repeal Obamacare. The rest do not support getting rid of the health care law that Trump . ..",
        "Cardboard. Memory foam. Wet cotton balls. There are many ways to describe the flavor of the supermarket tomato. It may be the only fruit in America to qualify as a biological tragedy. Back in 1989, a molecular biologist named Harry Klee was hired by Monsanto to create a genetically modified tomato with better flavor. After years of research and $10 million, Klee managed to develop one \u2014 but it tasted only marginally superior to what was available in supermarkets.",
        "Federal Judge Ann Donnelly of the Eastern District of New York has handed an early victory to the lawyers challenging President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order barring immigrants and travelers from seven countries from entering the US. Judge Donnelly announced during an emergency hearing Saturday night that she was granting a stay that would prevent the government from deporting immigrants currently detained in airports around the country. You can read the stay in full here. Now, let\u2019s be clear: The stay does not strike down the full executive order.",
        "On Friday, Donald Trump made the most plainly indefensible promise of his presidential campaign a reality. He suspended all refugee admissions to the US for 120 days, even as millions of displaced people from Syria, Iraq, Myanmar, and elsewhere are risking their lives to flee murderous governments and hellish war zones. He barred all entry to the US for natives of seven countries, a ban so wide in scope that it prevents as many as 500, 000 green card holders from either leaving America or coming back if they\u2019re now abroad.",
        "On Friday, Donald Trump signed a controversial executive order that blocks immigrants from seven countries from entering the United States \u2014 initially including legal permanent residents, commonly known as \u201cgreen card\u201d holders. The result: A bunch of people from these seven countries have gotten stranded in airports, unable to enter the United States. They range from people just arriving in the US for new jobs to people who have lived in America legally for years and were merely taking a vacation overseas.",
        "Key congressional Republicans who denounced Donald Trump\u2019s proposed \u201cMuslim ban\u201d during the campaign have refused to condemn the president\u2019s executive order barring immigrants of seven countries. On December 2, 2015, Trump called for a \u201dtotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d That proposal was repeatedly repudiated by key leaders in the Republican Party, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Vice President Mike Pence, then the governor of Indiana. Calls to ban Muslims from entering the U. S. are offensive and unconstitutional.",
        "Samira Asgari had spent months planning her move from Switzerland to the United States. The Iranian had secured a postdoctoral fellowship at the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. She\u2019d won a prestigious award for her research in genomics that would even pay her salary at her new American lab. \u201cI was really happy, and it felt like everything was going right,\u201d she said. But everything changed this morning, when Asgari flew from Geneva to Frankfurt. There, she attempted to board her second flight to Boston. \u201cA gentleman stopped me from boarding the plane,\u201d she said.",
        "President Trump\u2019s executive order barring nearly all refugees from entering the United States has been in effect for less than 24 hours. But it has already upended the lives of real people. It\u2019s keeping families apart and destroying their plans to continue \u2014 or rebuild \u2014 their lives. In New York, two Iraqi refugees, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, were detained overnight at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Both of these men worked with the US military and contractors in Iraq. Their lives were threatened as a result.",
        "On Sunday night it appeared protesters of Donald Trump\u2019s executive order issuing a broad temporary ban on entries to the US from any national of 7 countries had scored an early victory. The Department of Homeland Security said it would no longer bar holders from those countries from entering the United States. The precise language of the DHS statement \u2014 which came after a weekend of contradictory statements from other federal officials \u2014 was that permanent resident status (a green card) would be a \u201cdispositive factor\u201d in allowing immigrants from those countries into the US during screening.",
        "President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Friday temporarily blocking people from seven countries from entering the US on visas. The list of targeted countries is Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen \u2014 all countries. Trump\u2019s order says that it protects American people from the threat of terrorism. It doesn\u2019t necessarily do that. But it does show that the new president is serious about putting the Islamophobia that was a central part of his campaign into practice.",
        "Let\u2019s say you\u2019re trying to board a plane from another country and cross the border into the United States. There have always been reasons why you can\u2019t enter the US, like if the US believes you\u2019re a spy or a terrorist. But on Friday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that added to these reasons \u2014 and now innocent people, including refugees, will be turned away. (Read an explainer here.) So if you\u2019re trying to enter the US, you now have to pass a few more tests.",
        "Arina Yaghoubi is obsessed with Drake. She reminisces about the days she watched Hannah Montana as a kid. She tweets about pizza and drinking too much coffee. She\u2019s far from keen on Donald Trump\u2019s presidency but has a certain respect for Ivanka Trump\u2019s class and ambition. She\u2019s 21 years old, and she has cancer, and even that, suddenly, is not her only concern, due to an order signed by the new president. It\u2019s leukemia she\u2019s battling at St. Jude Hospital in Memphis. It\u2019s the second time in two years that her cancer has come back.",
        "Will Hurd is a Republican member of the US House of Representatives. His district, which stretches from the suburbs of San Antonio to the outskirts of El Paso, also contains the largest swathe of the border of anyone in Congress. And because the sections of the border that pass through California, Arizona, and New Mexico are overwhelmingly already protected by physical barriers of one kind or another (some of it a wall, some of it more like a fence) he represents far and away the majority of the land through which Trump\u2019s new physical border would be built.",
        "Trump\u2019s sweeping executive order on immigrants has already led to a great deal of chaotic fallout \u2014 and we\u2019re now learning that the process of putting the order together was equally chaotic.",
        "Note: We\u2019ve stopped checking for statements by members of Congress. Donald Trump\u2019s executive order, which bans entry into the US if you\u2019re from one of seven countries, was signed on Friday afternoon. Almost every Democratic member of Congress publicly opposed the order, on Twitter, on Facebook, or in a statement.",
        "On Saturday night, thousands of protesters around the country flooded airports to speak out against President Donald Trump\u2019s newly signed executive order barring travelers from seven countries. The New York Taxi Workers Alliance quickly showed its support, calling on social media for drivers to avoid John F. Kennedy International Airport between 6 and 7 pm Eastern time on Saturday. BREAKING: NYTWA drivers call for one hour work stoppage @ JFK airport today 6 PM to 7 PM to protest #muslimban!",
        "Nearly every modern president has, at one time or another, reached the point at which at least 50 percent of the country disapproved of his job performance as president. For Donald Trump, though, that moment has come earlier than most \u2014 much earlier. While Trump entered office with approval, he now stands at a dismal 42 percent approval, according to a Gallup poll of 1, 500 Americans released January 28. The same poll showed that just eight days into his presidency, 51 percent of those surveyed do not approve of Trump\u2019s job in office.",
        "Fraternal twins can look as similar or dissimilar as any other siblings \u2014 from features to size and height to hair color. So when they\u2019re born with different skin tones, it\u2019s not really a big deal. Or at least it shouldn\u2019t be. But somehow, thanks to the often confusing topic of racial identity, stories like People magazine\u2019s \u201cBiracial Twins Born in Illinois: \u2018It\u2019s So Rare\u2019\u201d still make headlines. \u201cTwins in Quincy, Illinois, are garnering attention and not just because they are super adorable,\u201d People reported Tuesday.",
        "With President Trump\u2019s attorney general nominee, Jeff Sessions, still awaiting Senate confirmation, Sally Yates, a holdover from President Obama\u2019s administration, has been running the Justice Department. And in a dramatic statement Monday night, Yates announced that she was instructing department lawyers not to defend Trump\u2019s executive order \u2014 which restricts entry into the US by refugees and nationals of seven countries \u2014 from court challenges. \u201cI am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful,\u201d Yates wrote.",
        "On Monday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that, he says, would force federal agencies to scrap two older regulations for every new one they propose. \u201cSo if there\u2019s a new regulation,\u201d Trump said, \u201cthey have to knock out two. \u201d It\u2019s a bold claim. But it\u2019s not clear that things will actually work this way. The order itself has some sizeable loopholes, and experts say it\u2019s far more likely to create confusion within federal agencies than lead to massive deregulation. Jody Freeman, a law professor at Harvard, calls it \u201carbitrary\u201d and \u201cnot implementable.",
        "\u201cWe don\u2019t want them here,\u201d President Donald Trump said on January 27, just before he signed his controversial executive order on immigrants and refugees. \u201cWe want to make sure we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. \u201d Thus launched the refugee ban that would be among the first controversies of the Trump administration. As written, that first executive order banned immigrants and visa holders from seven countries \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Sudan, and Somalia \u2014 from entering the US for 90 days.",
        "A Senate Democrat announced Monday that he will filibuster Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court \u2014 setting up what would be only the second time in modern history that a nominee to the Court has been filibustered. \u201cWe will use every lever in our power to stop this,\u201d Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley told Politico. \u201cA very large number of my colleagues will be opposed. \u201d In practical terms, a filibuster from Senate Democrats will almost certainly not prevent Trump from getting whichever nominee he wants.",
        "One of Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominee has galvanized more opposition than any other: Betsy DeVos, the conservative billionaire philanthropist whom Trump has nominated to head the Department of Education. She\u2019s inspired hashtags, a \u201cwear red day\u201d revolt among teachers, and an aggressive critique from sitting Democrats. In recent days, her critics have reportedly overwhelmed phone lines urging senators to oppose her nomination when it comes up for a vote this week. Take, for example, the nerve she\u2019s struck among North Dakotans. Wall Street Journal reporter Reid Epstein reported Monday what he\u2019d heard from Sen.",
        "Former President Barack Obama indicated that he is not going to just fade away or stay silent even though he\u2019s no longer in the Oval Office. His office released a statement Monday praising protesters and saying that Obama \u201cfundamentally disagrees\u201d with Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration and refugees. The full text, attributed to spokesperson Kevin Lewis, reads: President Obama is heartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country.",
        "Due to security concerns for her family in Syria and all over the world, Nadia Al Moualem uses a pseudonym in telling her story. No one wants to be a refugee. My husband and I loved our home in Daraa, Syria: a spacious house with a courtyard that smelled of jasmine, where we ate in the evenings with our families and friends. We raised our daughters and sons to work hard and get an education; two graduated from college, and two were almost finished when the revolution began.",
        "There is a story Donald Trump liked to tell on the campaign trail. The story of the snake. The fable goes like this. A \u201c \u201d woman finds a wounded snake on the road. She takes it in and nurses it back to health. The snake, revived, bites her. The woman, dying, asks why. Trump loves recounting the story. He makes a performance out of it. He puts on his reading glasses. He lingers on the antiquated, florid language."
