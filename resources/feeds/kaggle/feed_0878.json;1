        "Six months ago, President Donald Trump signed an executive order shutting out refugees and halting visas from six countries. But that ban was never implemented, thanks to rulings in two separate federal courts. That changed on Monday. The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration should be permitted to enforce the ban starting on Thursday, June 29. The court did impose some restrictions on the ban, however, including allowing people who already have a valid visa to enter the country. The ban on refugees remains, though.",
        "It\u2019s happened: After promises of strict immigration measures to halt the flow of visitors from countries on the campaign trail, President Donald Trump has signed an executive order for a ban on entries from seven countries (which also includes a ban on refugees). How did we get here? The short answer: fear. Fear of refugees isn\u2019t logical. It\u2019s emotional. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s so powerful. After the Paris terror attacks in 2015 and the Brussels attacks last year, Trump called for banning travel from countries. And people at his rallies cheered.",
        "Donald Trump has officially closed America\u2019s doors to some of the world\u2019s most desperate, banning all refugees from entering the country for 90 days \u2014 and banning Syrian refugees indefinitely. His timing could hardly be worse. The world is currently in the midst of a refugee crisis unlike anything we\u2019ve seen in the post \u2014 World War II era. A series of conflicts around the world, most notably but not only the Syrian civil war, has left more than 60 million people without homes or a safe place to return to.",
        "President Donald Trump released a brief statement to commemorate International Holocaust Remembrance Day, a small, symbolic step taken by past presidents to mark one of the world\u2019s greatest tragedies. It didn\u2019t take long for many people to notice that a key word was missing: Jews. \u201cIt is with a heavy heart and somber mind that we remember and honor the victims, survivors, heroes of the Holocaust,\u201d Trump\u2019s statement began. \u201cIt is impossible to fully fathom the depravity and horror inflicted on innocent people by Nazi terror.",
        "President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Friday, January 27, banning all immigrants and visa holders from seven nations from entering the United States for 90 days. The executive order, titled \u201cProtecting the Nation From Terrorist Attacks by Foreign Nationals,\u201d applies to visitors from Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, and Iran, including dual citizens. It bans all refugees for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely. For two days, the ban also applied green card holders.",
        "\u201cHumans are social animals\u201d is a phrase often repeated by psychologists to sum up why we\u2019ve been such a successful species. Our ability to live, work, and cooperate in groups is the key to our survival. But it comes with a tradeoff. Companionship is an asset for human survival, but its mirror twin, isolation, can be toxic. Loneliness is associated with higher blood pressure and heart disease \u2014 it literally breaks our hearts. A 2015 of 70 studies showed that loneliness increases the risk of your chance of dying by 26 percent.",
        "Not every movie that screens at the Sundance Film Festival will end up playing at your local multiplex: Distributors \u201cshop\u201d at the festival for movies to buy, and only then do they start making plans for theatrical and streaming release. That means some of the films they pick up might not arrive in theaters for a year or more \u2014 no matter how good they are.",
        "On Monday, Neil Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge on the 10th Circuit, begins confirmation hearings to succeed Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. Gorsuch is a widely acclaimed jurist, a favorite of conservatives and libertarians but also very respected by liberal colleagues. He\u2019s exactly the kind of elite, educated figure who\u2019s traditionally made it onto the Court. His mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, was Ronald Reagan\u2019s director of the Environmental Protection Agency from 1981 to 1983.",
        "President Donald Trump upended American immigration policy with three executive orders in his first week as president. He may not be done yet. The Washington Post obtained two draft executive orders the Trump administration is reportedly considering, both of which (in title and content) resemble documents Vox wrote about and published last week. One order deals with work visas; the other addresses social services for legal immigrants who are already in the United States. It\u2019s an indication that the many immigration restrictions Trump has signed are not the full scope of what key advisers have discussed.",
        "Wondering how Neil Gorsuch, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals judge whom President Trump has nominated to serve on the Supreme Court, thinks about the proper role of judges? You could do a lot worse than to read the 2016 Sumner Canary Memorial Lecture, which Gorsuch delivered in April of last year at Case Western Reserve University School of Law. Neil Gorsuch Of Lions and Bears, Judges and Legislators, and the Legacy of Justice Scalia by Dylan Matthews on Scribd The lecture was delivered two months after the passing of Antonin Scalia, whom Gorsuch is nominated to succeed.",
        "Steve Bannon, the chief strategist in President Trump\u2019s White House, is a political brawler who has told the news media to \u201ckeep its mouth shut\u201d and helped craft a controversial new executive order on immigration without talking to the Cabinet secretaries charged with carrying it out. All of that makes his new appointment to a full seat on the Principals Committee of the National Security Council all the more jarring. No White House political adviser has ever previously served on the NSC, which is charged with giving Trump unvarnished advice about literal national security issues.",
        "In September 2016, when the possibility of a Trump presidency still seemed remote, Aya Aljamili, a Syrian citizen who grew up in Aleppo, arrived in the United States to get her master\u2019s degree at American University in Washington, DC. She spent most of the fall on her computer, refreshing Facebook, hoping to hear from friends and family left behind in the war zone. When I spoke with Aljamili three weeks ago, she told me she\u2019d started making plans to visit her family \u2014 currently living in Gaziantep, a city near the border \u2014 this spring.",
        "\u201cNancy Pelosi and Fake Tears Chuck Schumer held a rally at the steps of The Supreme Court,\u201d President Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday morning, \u201cand mic did not work (a mess) like Dem party. \u201d The jibe was a to remarks the president made to reporters earlier in the day after a White House meeting with owners. \u201dI noticed Chuck Schumer yesterday with fake tears,\u201d Trump told the press pool.",
        "In the immediate wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, as one State Department official would later recall, the Bush administration\u2019s Department of Justice \u201cwanted to shut down visas like they shut down airplanes\u201d \u2014 completely. They never followed through; they didn\u2019t come close. Officials ultimately settled on adding an extra security check before issuing visas to men from countries where was active (in addition to putting a pause on refugee resettlement). Even a major terrorist attack wasn\u2019t enough to turn people away from the US categorically.",
        "New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Monday that he will propose an amendment to codify Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion, into the New York state constitution. \u201cOur rights are under attack in Washington. And as they seek to limit women\u2019s rights, we in New York seek to protect them,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cAnd as they threaten this nation with a possible Supreme Court nominee who will reverse Roe v. Wade, I want them to know today if that\u2019s what they do, we\u2019re going to protect Roe v. Wade in the state of New York.",
        "For the past 20 years, American politicians have mostly debated illegal immigration to the United States. But inside the Donald Trump administration, there appear to be discussions that go much further. A draft memo is raising the idea of a broad crackdown on the legal employment of workers. Jeff Sessions, Trump\u2019s nominee to serve as attorney general and guru on immigration policy, and senior adviser Steve Bannon have both been longtime restrictionists across all categories of migration, so this isn\u2019t entirely surprising.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s second Monday as president ended with a bang, as he decided to fire acting Attorney General Sally Yates for refusing to defend his sweeping immigration order in court. Yates, a holdover from President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, had been running the Justice Department in the early days of the Trump administration while Jeff Sessions has been awaiting confirmation as attorney general.",
        "The abrupt rollout of President Trump\u2019s immigration executive order over the weekend caused utter chaos at airports around the country. That chaos might calm down eventually \u2014 but the executive order won\u2019t stop rupturing immigrants\u2019 lives. White House officials and some congressional Republicans appear to have settled on the line that the problems with the immigration order were a matter of temporary \u201cinconvenience\u201d to some small number of people. That\u2019s only narrowly true. After the first few days, the government\u2019s actions to prevent people from coming to the US will be invisible to most Americans.",
        "On Sunday, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the White House to decry President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping executive order banning Syrian refugees and visa holders from seven nations. But at times, the crowd chants switched from criticizing Trump to \u201cStop President Bannon!\u201d Trump may have signed the executive order, but critics have gleaned that the policy\u2019s severity was the work of his chief strategist Steve Bannon, formerly an executive at Breitbart \u2014 an platform for the views of .",
        "President Donald Trump\u2019s new immigration order \u2014 the one many have labeled a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d because it temporarily bars entry to the US for natives of seven countries \u2014 stops people associated with various films from attending the 2017 Academy Awards. That\u2019s just one reason the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should cancel its annual ceremony and instead announce the winners via press release.",
        "A lot happened in the 2016 campaign, but one of the things Donald Trump did to win the election was shift to the left on a number of key issues \u2014 promising to avoid cuts in Social Security and Medicare benefits and adopting a longstanding Democratic pledge to let Medicare negotiate bulk discounts in the price it pays for prescription drugs. Today, after a meeting with pharmaceutical industry lobbyists and executives, he abandoned that pledge, referring to an idea he supported as recently as three weeks ago as a form of \u201cprice fixing\u201d that would hurt \u201csmaller, younger companies.",
        "For liberals alarmed by Donald Trump\u2019s election, there is something heartening about the revelation that the new president has no idea what he\u2019s doing. His rollout of new travel restrictions aimed at offering a constitutionally, economically, and diplomatically viable alternative to his campaign pledge of a total ban on Muslim entry to the country has been shambolic. It has spurred judicial and political mobilization against a sloppy and policy, which will likely end up with Trump accomplishing much less harm than he could have with a more measured approach.",
        "We are part of the legal team that sued President Donald Trump, on January 23, for violating the Constitution. We did so not for partisan reasons, but to affirm the most basic aspect of the rule of law: No one, not even the president, is above the law. From the first moments of his presidency, Donald Trump has been violating an important constitutional provision: the foreign emoluments clause, which prevents a government official from benefiting personally from a foreign government.",
        "Whenever a reactionary populist regime takes power and begins doing illiberal things, the same question arises among its critics: How much of this is part of a master plan and how much is just flailing? What is the exact mix of incompetence and ill intent? That argument is already taking shape around Trump, as he issues executive orders poorly understood by his own bureaucracy and fires members of his administration. It is aptly captured in two recent essays. The first is by Yonatan Zunger, a Google privacy engineer.",
        "Vice President Mike Pence broke a Senate tie to confirm Betsy DeVos, as the next education secretary, after a contentious process that made her Trump\u2019s most divisive nominee. So the thousands of Americans who called their senators begging them to vote against DeVos, in the end, aren\u2019t going to get what they want. The Senate Democrats who stayed up all night arguing that she would be a disaster as education secretary were stymied too. But that doesn\u2019t mean the opposition failed utterly.",
        "On the same day the Senate confirmed Rex Tillerson as Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state, the House voted to kill a transparency rule for oil companies that Tillerson once lobbied against while CEO of Exxon Mobil. So all in all, a good day for America\u2019s largest oil and gas firm. Using the Congressional Review Act, the House GOP voted on Wednesday to kill an regulation that would require publicly traded oil, gas, and mining companies to disclose any payments that they made to foreign governments, including taxes and royalties.",
        "Over the past few days, our inboxes have been flooded with letters from doctors and medical researchers whose lives have been shaken up by President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order, which, among other things, restricts immigrants and visa holders from seven countries from entering the US. We\u2019ve heard from health care workers who are trapped inside the United States, and from those who can\u2019t enter, despite having jobs, research positions, and US visas or green cards. It\u2019s . But the chaos unleashed by the executive order also reveals a fact about our health care system: We\u2019re heavily reliant on foreigners.",
        "Last Friday, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order that dramatically upended US immigration policy and banned both refugees and nationals from seven countries from entering the US. The effect was immediate and total chaos. That\u2019s mostly because, according to reports, the Trump administration barely consulted with any of the agencies actually tasked with carrying out the order before issuing it, and didn\u2019t issue any sort of guidance to those agencies about how to implement the new policy or explain it publicly.",
        "This month, Kellyanne Conway, senior adviser to President Donald Trump, was asked whether the administration would refuse to enforce the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate \u2014 the requirement that people get health insurance or pay a penalty. \u201cHe may,\u201d she said, instantly sending a shiver of fear down the spines of health reform\u2019s supporters. Without the mandate, insurance markets in many states will teeter; some will probably collapse. Would it be legal for Trump to decline to enforce the mandate? The short answer is no. The longer answer is more complicated, but it\u2019s also instructive.",
        "President Donald Trump repeatedly promised on the campaign trail that he would pick a \u201c \u201d Supreme Court justice. Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch as his Supreme Court nominee on Tuesday night. Gorsuch is, without a doubt, a respected conservative jurist. But when it comes to abortion rights, specifically, Gorsuch\u2019s record is minimal. He\u2019s never ruled on a case hinging on the constitutionality of abortion restriction. So the best way to look at his views is to look at how he\u2019s thought about birth control and about assisted suicide. Together, it appears he is more likely than ."
