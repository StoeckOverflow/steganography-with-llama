        "\u201cPull a lever for me and you\u2019ll horrify them all. \u201d That\u2019s how journalist and author Matt Taibbi describes the proposition Donald Trump made to the electorate in 2016. For the past year, Taibbi has covered Trump for Rolling Stone. His latest book, Insane Clown President: Dispatches From the 2016 Circus, is a collection of and shortform articles drawn from that experience. To read the pieces in chronological order is to witness a familiar journey: In the beginning, like so many people, Taibbi saw Trump\u2019s candidacy as a joke.",
        "Earlier this week, David Brooks wrote that Republicans and conservatives had made \u201ca Faustian bargain with Donald Trump,\u201d agreeing to tolerate all the things they may privately find disturbing about the president in return for the chance to score major wins on some of their key issues. With the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, Trump has begun delivering on his part of the bargain \u2014 and even those on the right who often criticized Trump during the campaign are beside themselves with joy.",
        "Dan Kahan is a professor of law and psychology at Yale whose research over the years has taught us something critically important about political debate today. It\u2019s this: While we would like to believe we can persuade people on the other side of a political debate with evidence, his studies show the other side is likely to become even more deeply entrenched in its view in the face of more information. His findings are a blow to the great underlying assumption of democracy: that an informed public is the key for a government that works.",
        "Early on Wednesday, in a bizarre rant supposedly commemorating Black History Month, President Donald Trump made a curious statement about the black abolitionist, activist, and writer Frederick Douglass: He \u201cis an example of somebody who\u2019s done an amazing job and he\u2019s being recognized more and more, I noticed. \u201d Frederick Douglass did \u201can amazing job\u201d and CNN is \u201cfake news,\u201d President Trump says in History Month listening session pic. twitter. \u2014 Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) February 1, 2017 Douglass passionately wrote and spoke for the abolition of slavery as a black man who himself escaped slavery.",
        "On Wednesday, Republicans in Congress will get started dismantling President Barack Obama\u2019s environmental legacy \u2014 deploying a rarely used tactic to overturn two big federal regulations around coal mining and methane leaks (as well as three other rules). The background here is that it would be tricky and for the Trump administration to repeal many regulations all by itself.",
        "Saturday saw thousands of Americans hit the streets for the March for Science to protest President Trump\u2019s proposal to cut billions in funding for scientific research. This mobilization came three months after millions joined in Women\u2019s Marches across the country and separate protests of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order banning immigrants and refugees from entering the country. More mass demonstrations are in the works.",
        "If Trump\u2019s pharma comments are any clue, we have no idea what he wants on Obamacare President Trump has apparently done some rethinking on his views of American drug pricing policy, offering confusing remarks that indicated he might not support Medicare negotiating drug prices. \u201cI\u2019ll oppose anything that makes it harder for smaller, younger companies to take the risk of bringing their product to a vibrantly competitive market,\u201d Trump said after meeting with pharmaceutical executives Tuesday. \u201cThat includes by the biggest dog in the market, Medicare, which is what\u2019s happening.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s executive order limiting immigration from seven countries has made a lot of people upset. Immigrant communities are most directly affected, of course, and the policy inspired spontaneous protests at airports across the country this weekend. But some of the most consequential opponents may be business groups. Over the past four days, many American companies \u2014 including iconic brands Ford, and Apple \u2014 have denounced Trump\u2019s policy. Businesses normally try to stay out of politics, but several factors inspired these companies to speak out. Some have angry customers pressuring them to oppose the policy.",
        "GOP legislator: Medicaid will be \u201charder\u201d than I thought Yesterday afternoon, I interviewed Rep. Phil Roe ( ) a conservative legislator who the GOP Doctors Caucus and authored the Republican Study Committee\u2019s Obamacare replacement plan. We spent most of the time talking about that health care bill, and you can read that full conversation here. But one of the things Roe told me that surprised me the most was that he has begun to think Medicaid is going to be much harder than he initially expected.",
        "On Thursday morning, Americans woke up to the news that their president had gratuitously insulted the prime minister of Australia and maybe threatened to invade Mexico. In a call with Australian leader Malcolm Turnbull, Trump reportedly bragged about his election victory and railed against a deal the Obama administration had struck with the Australian government to take in a small number of refugees currently trying to enter Australia.",
        "On Saturday night, the hashtag #DeleteUber began trending on social media. Enraged by Uber\u2019s response to Donald Trump\u2019s controversial immigration order, customers demanded that Uber delete their accounts, and they went on Facebook and Twitter to encourage their friends to do the same thing. The protest was inspired by Uber\u2019s decision to disable surge pricing around New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy Airport in response to a taxi drivers\u2019 strike spurred by the Trump order \u2014 something Uber routinely does during emergencies to avoid being seen as profiting from tragedy.",
        "Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has withdrawn from Donald Trump\u2019s economic advisory council, according to reports by the New York Times and Recode. The announcement came in an internal company email after a week of protests by advocates of immigration rights. On Saturday night, New York taxi drivers announced a boycott of John F. Kennedy Airport to protest Donald Trump\u2019s controversial immigration order. Uber chose to continue serving the airport \u2014 albeit with surge pricing disabled \u2014 a move that critics saw as crossing picket lines.",
        "Just about every analyst agrees that the electric vehicle market is poised for rapid growth. But how rapid? It\u2019s not an idle question. The rate of EV growth will have huge implications for oil markets, auto markets, and electric utilities. Yet it is maddeningly difficult to predict the future; forecasts for the EV market are all over the place. I don\u2019t think the wide range of projections means that we\u2019re blind here, though \u2014 I think we can make educated guesses.",
        "Over the past two weeks, liberal activists have quietly and widely circulated a long Google spreadsheet. It contains the exact time, date, and location of more than 100 events that members of Congress will host in their districts this month. It\u2019s titled Town Hall Project 2018, and it is a battle plan, borrowed from an old foe: the Tea Party. In their efforts to pressure Republicans to save the Affordable Care Act, liberals are increasingly copying the tactics of the conservative activists who mobilized against the law in 2009.",
        "A new report from the US Department of Agriculture tracks how food consumption patterns in the US have changed over the past 40 years by looking at how many fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, dairy, added fats and oils, and added sugars and sweeteners per capita are available. (Food availability data, adjusted for food loss, is a pretty good proxy for consumption.) The main finding is no surprise at all: Americans are eating more of all of the major food groups, too many fats, sugars, and grains, and too few fruits and vegetables.",
        "Donald Trump has been president for less than two weeks, but his bizarre, meandering, angry phone calls with foreign leaders have spawned a frighteningly concise description: \u201ca normal Trump tantrum. \u201d Related Trump\u2019s bizarre, dangerous calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia, explained Those are the words of Graham Richardson, a senior cabinet minister in one of Australia\u2019s most recent Labor governments.",
        "With everything that Republicans want to do \u2014 repeal Obamacare, overhaul the tax code \u2014 it might seem odd that one of Congress\u2019 very first acts would be to kill an obscure regulation that restricts coal companies from dumping mining waste into streams and waterways. But that is indeed what\u2019s going on. In early February, the House and Senate voted to repeal the \u201cstream protection rule\u201d \u2014 using a tool known as the Congressional Review Act. On Thursday, President Trump signed the bill, which means the stream protection rule is now dead.",
        "Here\u2019s a question: Who was in charge of the implementation of Donald Trump\u2019s executive order on Friday banning people from seven countries and nearly all refugees from entering the US? It sounds like a trick question. Reporting over the last week has made it clear that the rollout of the executive order was chaotic at every level. The secretary of the Department of Homeland Security got briefed on it only as the president was signing the order on national TV.",
        "President Trump on Saturday justified his executive order suspending the US\u2019s refugee admissions program on national security grounds, calling for a more thorough form of \u201cextreme vetting\u201d to replace the current screening regime in order to better determine whether a refugee poses a danger to the country. But the reality is that the current vetting system is already pretty extreme: exhaustive, loaded with safeguards, enormously selective, and constantly being improved. It typically takes 18 to 24 months, but it can last as long as three years.",
        "There\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know for certain about Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be the next Supreme Court justice: for example, his exact views on abortion, gay rights, and affirmative action. But there\u2019s one issue, virtually unnoticed by the public but huge in the legal community, where Gorsuch\u2019s views are clear \u2014 and potentially critical for the future of government regulation and executive power. At issue is a doctrine known as Chevron deference, named for the 1984 Supreme Court case Chevron v.",
        "Around 1:30 pm on Tuesday, soon after a Saudi Airlines plane landed from Jeddah, a US Customs and Border Protection agent slipped through the security wall at the international arrivals terminal at Virginia\u2019s Washington Dulles airport. He opened a door, crossing between a group of people already welcomed to the United States, and those still waiting in bureaucratic limbo. Azadeh Erfani spotted him and began her chase, a copy of a court order in hand. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d she said. \u201cNo comment,\u201d the agent said. He walked past her. \u201cI\u2019m an attorney,\u201d Erfani said. \u201cI\u2019m not the press.",
        "It starts out innocently enough. A older woman stands in front of a pretty pastoral background talking about how a church group brought refugees into her neighborhood. Then about a minute in, things get really, really strange. The woman, Ann Corcoran, claims that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is \u201cunder the influence of a powerful Muslim supremacist group\u201d \u2014 and that the Muslim refugees it is sending over are the vanguard of an evil plot to colonize America and subject it to a theocratic Muslim government.",
        "In January, Rep. Jason Chaffetz ( ) introduced a bill in the House that would direct the Bureau of Land Management to sell off 3. 3 million acres of federally owned lands \u2014 an area the size of Connecticut. But this week, Chaffetz decided to yank the bill after a fierce backlash from hunters, sportsmen and women, and conservationists on both the left and the right. Privatizing public land, it turns out, is a lot harder than it sounds.",
        "If President Donald Trump\u2019s first two weeks in the White House have been defined by anything, it\u2019s protest. Just a day after Trump\u2019s inauguration, millions of people around the country demonstrated as part of the Women\u2019s Marches \u2014 potentially the biggest single day of protests in American history. And over this past weekend, thousands of people flooded airports to protest Trump\u2019s executive order banning refugees for 120 days and travelers from seven countries for 90 days. Many Americans are, it\u2019s safe to say, ready to protest Trump\u2019s presidency. But can these protests be successful?",
        "What kind of knife was the man that killed your father holding? Can you remember how many stars were on the jacket of the military officer that raped you? How many hours were you on the boat that night before the smuggler shot your brother and threw him overboard? How did you survive if you couldn\u2019t swim? Pause. I give her time to rest. I let the interpreter decide when the client is ready again.",
        "Republicans have a new idea on the path forward for the Affordable Care Act. Or, rather, in lieu of a new idea they have a new buzzword: repair. It was suggested to them not by a health policy guru but by Frank Luntz, a prominent Republican consultant who specializes in buzzwords. Luntz, according to a team of Bloomberg reporters who asked him about it, recommended the term because it \u201ccaptures exactly what the large majority of the American people want. \u201d As he explains, \u201cthe public is particularly hostile about skyrocketing costs, and they demand immediate change.",
        "Less than a full week into his presidency, Donald Trump took his very first foray into military counterterrorism operations in his new role as commander in chief, authorizing a risky US special operations raid on an base in Yemen. It didn\u2019t go well. The raid resulted in the deaths of at least 14 suspected militants and, according to the Pentagon, \u201cthe seizure of materials and information that is yielding valuable intelligence.",
        "The problem with Neil Gorsuch\u2019s nomination for the Supreme Court is not Neil Gorsuch. He is, by all accounts, a brilliant jurist and a kind man. But he is an extremely conservative judge at a moment when an extremely conservative judge makes a mockery of the popular will. For the good of the country and the Court, this moment demands a compromise nominee, and Gorsuch is not that. Antonin Scalia\u2019s seat came open under a Democratic president and a Republican Senate. This should have led to a centrist nominee.",
        "At least three of Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet officials are receiving payouts \u2014 \u201cgolden parachutes\u201d \u2014 from the companies they are leaving to join the federal government. Exxon Mobil will pay Rex Tillerson, its former CEO, a compensation package worth $180 million after he becomes secretary of state. Elaine Chao will receive between $1 million and $5 million from the bank Wells Fargo on her way to oversee Trump\u2019s transportation department. Goldman Sachs will award Gary Cohn, incoming chair of the National Economic Council, close to $285 million.",
        "Every year, up to 10 films get in the ring to duke it out for the biggest prize in movies: the coveted Oscar for Best Picture. The list of Best Picture nominees isn\u2019t necessarily the best indicator of overall trends in cinema \u2014 many of the year\u2019s best movies never make it onto the list, because they\u2019re too obscure, small, or foreign. Nonetheless, it\u2019s a good barometer for what Hollywood thinks is worth remembering. Some years there\u2019s a lot to gripe about when the nominations are released, but this year the Academy picked well."
