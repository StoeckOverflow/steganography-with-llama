        "In an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews that aired on Thursday night, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway managed to get two huge things wrong in a short, answer. First, she said that the Obama administration banned Iraqi refugees from entering in the United States for six months in 2011 \u2014 which is flatly untrue. Second, and more significantly, she made up a terrorist attack committed by Iraqi refugees that never happened \u2014 the \u201cBowling Green Massacre\u201d: . @KellyannePolls says that 2 Iraqi refugees \u201dwere the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. \u201d(There was no such massacre.) pic. twitter.",
        "In 1971, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first drug that could reverse a heroin or opioid overdose. More than 40 years later, makers of this drug, called naloxone, are cashing in on the nation\u2019s opioid painkiller and heroin epidemic and consumers. According to a group of researchers, the cost of one package of Evzio \u2014 a branded version of the lifesaving injection \u2014 has quickly risen from $690, when it hit the market in 2014, to $4, 500.",
        "There\u2019s a moment in the cult classic animated film An Extremely Goofy Movie where Bobby Zimmeruski, Max\u2019s stoner friend, asks, \u201cWhy do you think we\u2019re always, like, wearing gloves?\u201d If anyone could help me get to the bottom of this question, it\u2019s John Canemaker. He\u2019s an animation historian and professor at NYU. \u201cAt the dawn of animation\u201d he explains, \u201ccertain techniques to make the animation process easier were used. \u201d These techniques included using round edges instead of angles because they were more efficient to draw over and over and over again.",
        "At his first National Prayer Breakfast on February 2, President Trump reiterated a campaign promise \u2014 to repeal the Johnson Amendment: Our republic was formed on the basis that freedom is not a gift from government, but that freedom is a gift from God. It was the great Thomas Jefferson who said the God who gave us life gave us liberty. Jefferson asked, \u201cCan the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God?\u201d Among those freedoms is the right to worship according to our own beliefs.",
        "The Super Bowl is the purest distillation of America there is. It\u2019s brutal, lucrative, tawdry, spectacular, amazing, and full of delicious snacks. It\u2019s the one moment when we as a nation truly come together to reflect on our greatest achievements as a society \u2014 television, innovative chicken and cheese products, and marketing. This year, there\u2019s also going to be a football game on. But as the social pressure to watch a football game \u2014 or at least be in the presence of others who are watching \u2014 mounts, you may find yourself with some nagging questions.",
        "President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping visa and refugee ban is likely only the beginning. Already he has signed a variation of a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d \u2014 and has suggested expanding it. He has pushed forward on the southern border wall, regardless of Mexico\u2019s refusal to pay for it. And he is reportedly considering moves to overhaul the United States\u2019 legal work visa program ( visas) that many technology companies rely on. To many, it would appear that Trump is doing what he said he would do.",
        "The Super Bowl dominates the list of the programs in American television history, routinely drawing more than 100 million total viewers \u2014 even in the current era, where shows that attract more than 10 million are considered smash hits. The mania for all things related to the NFL\u2019s annual championship game spreads beyond game day. Sports news channels offer coverage of every pregame interview and workout. The NFL\u2019s own cable network runs marathons of past Super Bowl highlights. The entertainment media speculates about what the halftime show will entail.",
        "Approximately 9. 2 million people signed up for 2017 coverage through Healthcare. gov, a decrease from 9. 6 million enrollments in 2016, the Trump administration announced Friday afternoon. The health care marketplace had especially lackluster performance in its last two weeks, from January 15 to 31, when about 376, 620 people enrolled in coverage. Nearly double that number \u2014 789, 708 people \u2014 signed up in the same time period last year. These new numbers will no doubt fuel the already fierce political battle over whether the health law\u2019s programs are working.",
        "On Friday night, Judge James Robart of the Western District of Washington issued a temporary restraining order that forces the federal government to stop enforcing a ban on entries to the US from seven countries, as well as nearly all refugees. The ruling was issued in a lawsuit against the federal government by the attorneys general of Washington and Minnesota \u2014 one of 40 that have been filed against the ban so far. The Trump administration hasn\u2019t had much luck defending the executive order.",
        "LGBTQ groups are worried that President Donald Trump will soon act on what they\u2019ve long feared: an executive order that would give federal employees and contractors a \u201clicense to discriminate\u201d based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The White House said the order is not happening \u2014 for now. \u201cThere is no plan to take any action on this topic at this time,\u201d principal Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told me in an email Thursday morning. But LGBTQ groups remain fearful, pointing to Trump and his Republican colleagues\u2019 history on these issues and a recent leak.",
        "In his final State of the Union address one year ago, President Obama announced a \u201cmoonshot\u201d initiative to \u201ccure cancer once and for all. \u201d Though the moonshot will be one of Obama\u2019s few health programs to continue under President Donald Trump \u2014 its $1. 8 billion budget is secure \u2014 today, on World Cancer Day, it remains more difficult than ever to imagine a real cure. Take the man diagnosed with prostate cancer in my clinic at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.",
        "Two days ago, the Trump administration ominously warned Iran that it was putting the country \u201con notice\u201d after Tehran flexed its muscles in the region by testing a ballistic missile over the weekend. It didn\u2019t take long for Trump to follow through on the threat: On Friday morning, the Treasury Department announced that it was expanding sanctions against Iran.",
        "A photo of President Donald Trump in the Oval Office signing a series of executive orders \u2014 including one that would dramatically restrict women\u2019s access to health care around the world \u2014 surrounded by nothing but white men sparked anger and ridicule on social media last week, with many pointing out the irony of the situation: As long as you live you\u2019ll never see a photograph of 7 women signing legislation about what men can do with their reproductive organs pic. twitter.",
        "Reddit has banned a handful of controversial subreddits whose members are part of the white nationalist because users repeatedly violated the site\u2019s terms of service regarding doxing and harassment. The most prominent of those subreddits, was shut down on Wednesday for \u201cproliferation of personal and confidential information,\u201d according to Reddit. The subreddit had been an ongoing source of controversy and had previously sparked debate in November, after Reddit moderators named it \u201cSubreddit of the Day. \u201d Two additional subreddits, and were also banned for \u201cviolating the Reddit rules.",
        "Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed a new bill into law last week that effectively bans abortions after 14 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 or forces doctors to use riskier methods to perform them. The new law does this by banning the safest and most common method of performing an abortion in the second trimester, dilation and evacuation (D&E) which is used in about 95 percent of abortions in the US. Doctors who violate the ban face felony charges. The law does have an exception for risks to the woman\u2019s health.",
        "J. D. Vance\u2019s Hillbilly Elegy has been adopted as the book that explains Trumpism. It\u2019s the book that both Sen. Mitch McConnell and Sen. Rob Portman recommended as their favorite of 2016. It\u2019s a book Rep. Keith Ellison, the frontrunner to lead the Democratic National Committee, brought up in my recent conversation with him. Everyone, on both sides of the aisle, has turned to Vance to explain What It All Means. All of which is a bit odd, because Vance\u2019s book is an awkward fit with Trumpism.",
        "On his 13th day in office, President Donald Trump threatened to break an international agreement. On Twitter. Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal! \u2014 Donald J.",
        "Melissa McCarthy made a surprise visit to Saturday Night Live on February 4, channeling her signature comedic rage to play Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary who\u2019s spent the better part of the past two weeks defending President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration and the size of his inauguration crowd to a confused press. She first stormed onstage in a square suit, glared out at the audience, and spat, \u201cI\u2019m apologizing on behalf of you to me, for how you\u2019ve treated me for the last two weeks. And that apology is not accepted.",
        "It\u2019s easy to miss amid Donald Trump\u2019s frenetic pace of activity and nonstop media coverage, but the most important story in American politics right now isn\u2019t about what Trump is doing: It\u2019s that the opposition is working. The millions of people who marched in Washington and other cities around the world on inauguration weekend and then demonstrated again at airports the following weekend are making a concrete difference in the world. So are the tens of thousands who\u2019ve called members of Congress or showed up in person at their events.",
        "A group of former CIA and US Department of State officials who worked under Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton on Sunday filed a legal brief against President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration order, arguing that it \u201cundermines the national security of the United States. \u201d The brief, which officially opposes the order that halted refugee intake into the US for 120 days and travel from seven countries for 90 days, was signed on to by mostly Democratic administration officials, including Obama and Clinton Secretaries of State John Kerry and Madeleine Albright.",
        "Marine Le Pen, the face and leader of the French Front National party, believes France should exit the European Union, drop the euro, and fight radical Islam, and not necessarily in that order. \u201cThe division is no longer between the right and the left,\u201d she told her supporters this weekend, \u201cbut between patriots and [believers in] globalization. \u201d On Sunday, Le Pen officially launched her bid for the French presidency, before an adoring crowd of about 3, 000 in the French city of Lyon.",
        "On Friday, the Trump administration announced an expansion of sanctions against Iran, its first action after a previous warning that it was putting Tehran \u201con notice\u201d after the country tested a ballistic missile the weekend before. You\u2019d expect Iran to react angrily. But the move also sparked criticism from a source you might not have expected: China.",
        "Every year, two football teams claw their way to the top of the NFL to tear each other to pieces on live television for our viewing pleasure. And every year, millions of Americans watch the game less for the actual football than because they want to see the commercials everyone will be talking about the next day. Sometimes these exorbitantly expensive ads do little more than bombard us with celebrity cameos and anthropomorphized animals.",
        "On his first day in office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order instructing his agencies to dismantle the Affordable Care Act \u201cto the maximum extent permitted by law. \u201d But what that would actually mean in practice has remained extremely unclear. The administration has drawn up a proposed new rule, but its content isn\u2019t yet public. However, the Huffington Post\u2019s Jonathan Cohn reports that, according to \u201cindustry consultants and lobbyists,\u201d the administration is considering a few executive changes affecting the insurance market.",
        "Last summer, Matt Anderson cut his finger on a knife while doing dishes. He\u2019s a college student, and his roommate, a biology major, suggested that he go to the emergency room. He had recently used the same knife to cut raw meat and thought Anderson\u2019s finger might get infected. Anderson estimates he got to the emergency room around 11 pm. A nurse saw him shortly after midnight and cleaned his wound. A doctor came by a little later to apply liquid stitches to his finger. Anderson went home around 1 am.",
        "Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes is exactly the kind of Democrat whom you would expect to lend bipartisan support to President Donald Trump\u2019s $1 trillion infrastructure proposal. The chair of the \u201d \u201d New Democrat Coalition on the party\u2019s right flank, Himes said he\u2019s been thrilled for months by Trump\u2019s promise of a major infrastructure bill \u2014 even if it relies more on private investment than some progressives would like. \u201dWe get really excited about the idea he keeps reverting to \u2014 a very major investment in infrastructure in a way the brings the economy into the 21st century.",
        "Melissa McCarthy nailed her Saturday Night Live impression of White House press secretary Sean Spicer. She captured his anger, his mocking tone toward the press, and his ability to produce spin in an instant. She also nailed the small details \u2014 like the fact that Spicer likes to swallow gum whole. \u201dI\u2019m here to swallow gum. And I\u2019m here to take names.\u201d #SNL pic. twitter. \u2014 Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) February 5, 2017 The bit about gum swallowing wasn\u2019t a joke.",
        "Lady Gaga\u2019s Super Bowl 51 halftime show was a showcase of her raw star power. Gaga transformed Houston\u2019s NRG Stadium into a slick arena concert, singing her best hits, bringing out her trademark mix of gleeful spectacle and chaos, and even weaving in a subtle political message. She quietly opened her performance with a medley of \u201cGod Bless America\u201d and \u201cThis Land Is Your Land,\u201d which she sang from the roof of the stadium with red and blue drone lights swirling behind her in the sky.",
        "Tax season is upon us, which means many of us are getting ready to prepare our taxes. Or, more likely, we\u2019re ready to have someone else do our taxes. A 2013 Quinnipiac poll found that 64 percent of Americans say they have someone else prepare their federal income tax return and a similar portion say it\u2019s too complicated. So if you asked many of them how US tax policy works right now, they may be stumped. So how would you fare?",
        "Some of Super Bowl 51\u2019s most intense drama started \u2014 as all good drama does \u2014 well before the game itself kicked off. The building supply company 84 Lumber wanted to air a poignant, weighty commercial depicting a Mexican mother and daughter making their way through the desert, with the daughter collecting scraps of fabric as they traveled, so she could eventually stitch them together into an American flag. Eventually, the pair ends up facing a giant wall."
