        "There is nothing about the Trump administration that should threaten America\u2019s system of government. The Founding Fathers were realistic about the presence and popularity of demagogues. The tendency of political systems to slip into autocracy weighed heavily on their minds. That power corrupts, and that power can be leveraged to amass more power, was a familiar idea. The political system the founders built is designed to withstand these pressures, and to a large extent, it has. So why, then, are we surrounded by articles worrying over America\u2019s descent into fascism or autocracy?",
        "In 2015, President Barack Obama signed an executive order that created the White House\u2019s Social and Behavioral Sciences Team, a team of social scientists tasked with using psychological research to make the government work better. Mostly, the team went after projects like testing language on a human resources form to get more service members to sign up for a savings plan, and testing whether a single signature box could get government vendors to report sales more accurately.",
        "Beatings. Starvation. Rape. And then death, administered quickly and with sickening efficiency. Those are the hallmarks of Saydnaya Prison, a facility just outside of Damascus that the Assad regime has turned into a death camp. Many of the inmates are civilian dissidents, and they are mostly killed not long after their arrival. As detailed in Amnesty International\u2019s newest report from Syria, \u201cHuman Slaughterhouse: Mass Hangings and Extermination at Saydnaya Prison,\u201d between 5, 000 and 13, 000 people have been executed there since the civil war began in 2011.",
        "Putting solar panels on rooftops and arrays is a process. You need people to design and manufacture the panels. Then people to market the panels to homes, businesses, and utilities. Then people to come and install them. It all adds up to a lot of jobs. Even though solar power still provides just a fraction of America\u2019s electricity \u2014 about 1. 3 percent \u2014 the industry now employs more than 260, 000 people, according to a new survey from the nonprofit Solar Foundation.",
        "This is it: The Trump administration is about to approve the final permit needed to finish the Dakota Access Pipeline, US Army officials told Congress on Tuesday. While it\u2019s still possible that a legal challenge could halt the controversial project, the pipeline is now very, very close to completion. Once built, it would transport 450, 000 barrels of crude oil per day from the Bakken fields of North Dakota to a shipping terminal in Illinois.",
        "Someone out there really wants President Donald Trump\u2019s polarizing nominee for secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, to get the job \u2014 so much so that they\u2019ve been paying random internet users to write notes supporting her contentious confirmation. Users on paid task sites like InstaGC, Swagbucks, which reward users for shopping at certain websites or completing small tasks and surveys online, as well as \u2018freemium\u2019 mobile fashion game Covet Fashion, have been reporting a task that links to SupportDeVos. com.",
        "Education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos narrowly squeaked through the Senate on Monday, winning confirmation by a vote of 51 to 50 after Vice President Mike Pence weighed in to break the tie. DeVos is the most controversial education secretary ever. She was confirmed with fewer votes than any Cabinet secretary in history. If Democrats hadn\u2019t abolished the filibuster on executive branch nominees in 2013, DeVos\u2019s opposition would have relegated her to the heap of Cabinet .",
        "The slender American woman in the black abaya looks directly at the camera, her two children, their faces caked with dirt, sitting just to her left. \u201cToday is December 3, 2016. We have waited since 2012 for someone to understand our problems, the Kafkaesque nightmare in which we find ourselves,\u201d she says in the video released by her captors in Afghanistan late last year. \u201cMy children have seen their mother defiled. We ask, in our collective 14th year of prison, that the governments on both sides reach some agreement to allow us freedom.",
        "During February, it\u2019s not uncommon to hear the refrain, \u201cIf there\u2019s an History Month, why isn\u2019t there a white one?\u201d This question, and its close relative \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with being proud of being white?\u201d sometimes comes from people who sincerely, if oversimplistically, think racial equality should mean identical treatment for all racial identity groups. But it\u2019s also the kind of idea you might hear from members of the \u201c \u201d and groups with closely related beliefs: white nationalists and white supremacists.",
        "A federal judge in Washington state has imposed a temporary restraining order that prevents enforcement of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order banning residents from seven countries from entering the United States \u2014 either as refugees or as travelers. But whether that injunction will be upheld will be decided soon by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, by reputation one of the most liberal appellate courts in the nation. That result will affect the roughly 15 other federal court challenges across the nation, some filed on behalf of specific individuals and some more .",
        "Inside the Beltway, it\u2019s easy to forget that the fate of the Affordable Care Act is a question of life and death. If President Trump and the Congress repeal or destroy the law without replacing it, people will die. But getting a firm number on exactly how many deaths an ACA repeal would lead to is surprisingly contentious. Right now we don\u2019t have any direct evidence of Obamacare\u2019s impact on mortality, since it takes a long time for changes in things like health insurance to show up in death statistics and the law was only enacted in 2009.",
        "At a Tuesday meeting with law enforcement, President Donald Trump repeated a false claim he has made multiple times since he first launched his presidential campaign: He said that the US murder rate was the highest it\u2019s been in 45 to 47 years, according to a pool report. The false claim echoes remarks Trump made on the campaign trail and afterward, including several rallies where he said that \u201cthe murder rate in the United States is the highest it\u2019s been in 45 years. \u201d That would be very worrying if it were true. Thankfully, it\u2019s not. At all.",
        "Donald Trump has accused the media of bias and dishonesty, but his newest attack on the press has broken new ground in its brazenness \u2014 and its complete divorce from reality. Speaking to troops from the military\u2019s Central Command headquarters (CENTCOM) in Florida Monday, Trump accused the press of intentionally covering up terrorist attacks. No, seriously. The president of the US actually said that: Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland, as they did on as they did from Boston to Orlando to San Bernardino and all across Europe. You\u2019ve seen what happened in Paris and Nice.",
        "On Monday morning, President Donald Trump decided that there was an urgent matter he needed to clear up for the public. \u201cI call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cSome FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!\u201d It may seem odd that the president of the United States would feel compelled to remind the country that he is actually in charge.",
        "On Wednesday morning, two Democratic senators did something that had been declared out of bounds by their Republican colleagues just the night before \u2014 they read a letter from Coretta Scott King on the Senate floor. Written in 1986, the letter criticizes the civil rights record of Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) President Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general. When Sen.",
        "It was an unusual exchange even by cable news standards: When CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota asked Wisconsin Republican Rep. Sean Duffy why his party\u2019s leader, Donald Trump, says a lot about Muslim terrorists but nothing about white terrorists, Duffy said that there just haven\u2019t been that many white terrorists recently \u2014 and the ones that have existed didn\u2019t represent a broader problem. Here\u2019s part of the exchange, taken from Slate: CAMEROTA: Why isn\u2019t the president talking about the white terrorists who mowed down six Muslims praying at their mosque? DUFFY: I don\u2019t know.",
        "On Wednesday, Sen. Rand Paul published a curious on the conservative website Rare. In it, he lays out the case for why President Donald Trump shouldn\u2019t let Elliott Abrams, a former Reagan and Bush administration official who is reportedly Trump\u2019s pick for deputy secretary of state, into his administration. \u201cI hope against hope that the rumors are wrong,\u201d Paul writes. \u201cAbrams would be a terrible appointment for countless reasons. \u201d Paul has a solid case. In 1991, Abrams pleaded guilty to criminal charges stemming from his role in covering up the scandal.",
        "You\u2019ve probably heard something about this story. President Trump signed an executive order on January 27 that banned entry into the US by anyone from seven countries for 90 days, and banned nearly all refugees for 120 days. Over the week that it was in effect, it caused chaos at airports, heartbreak to families inside and outside the US, and confusion throughout the US government. After several temporary or localized court rulings protecting individual people, the order was put on hold February 3 by a federal judge, and is currently being considered in court.",
        "President Trump went to war Wednesday with Nordstrom, the department store, over its decision to stop carrying his daughter Ivanka\u2019s line of branded apparel. And it appears Nordstrom won, with the company\u2019s stock up almost 5 percent on the day. In today\u2019s battle of Trump vs @Nordstrom, Nordstrom is the overwhelming winner: shares up nearly 5% at the closing bell pic. twitter.",
        "Donald Trump campaigned as a champion of the \u201cforgotten man,\u201d promising to make America great again with a focus on populism and steel mills. He accused both Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton of being \u201ctotally controlled\u201d by Wall Street. And he cleverly leveraged Bernie Sanders\u2019s primary campaign accusations that Clinton was too close to banks into weapons he himself could wield.",
        "Gina Brown was pregnant and single when she was diagnosed with HIV in 1994. \u201cI thought I was going to die,\u201d she says. She promptly quit her job at a nursing home out of fear she\u2019d infect her elderly patients. More than 20 years later, Brown, now 51, is working as a social worker in New Orleans. The discovery of antiretroviral treatments turned her HIV diagnosis from a death sentence into a chronic illness, and Brown now worries more about her heartburn than the virus. But getting health care has been a constant struggle.",
        "Late on the night of November 14, Igor Sechin, the CEO of the Russian state oil giant Rosneft, reportedly summoned Economic Development Minister Alexei Ulyukayev to a meeting at the company\u2019s headquarters in a building across the river from the Kremlin. When he arrived, Ulyukayev was handed a large amount of cash in front of Sechin \u2014 and then arrested on the spot and charged with soliciting a $2 million bribe. Ulyukayev, who insists that he is innocent, was fired by Russian President Vladimir Putin the day after his arrest.",
        "Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) was censured on the floor of the Senate Tuesday night for criticizing Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) nominated to serve as President Donald Trump\u2019s attorney general. Only Warren wasn\u2019t criticizing Sessions in her own words. She was quoting the wife of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. In 1986, when Sessions was being considered for a federal judgeship, Coretta Scott King wrote to the Senate to urge them to reject his nomination. And she did not mince words.",
        "Every few years, various economists and wonks will try to sell the Republican Party on a carbon tax as a conservative solution to climate change. And so far, these campaigns have attracted public support from \u2026 exactly zero elected Republicans in Washington. But the dream refuses to die. On Wednesday, a handful of GOP elder statesmen \u2014 including officials James Baker III and George Shultz \u2014 unveiled their own big proposal for a conservative carbon tax at the National Press Club in Washington.",
        "Here\u2019s a quick answer to a question that\u2019s been bothering Donald Trump: If you want to improve living standards for most Americans, a strong dollar is better. But if you want to deliver on your campaign promises to the Midwest, you probably want a weaker one. A leak to S. V. Date and Christina Wilkie of the Huffington Post reveals that on one recent night, President Trump was up at 3 am and decided to call up National Security Advisor Michael Flynn to ask him about this.",
        "Over at the Upshot, Kyle Dropp and Brendan Nyhan look at a new Morning Consult poll exploring Americans\u2019 confusion regarding the terms \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d and \u201cObamacare. \u201d percent either think Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act are different policies or aren\u2019t sure whether they\u2019re different policies. The confusion is worst among young people and those making less than $50, 000, and it\u2019s magnified when you begin asking about the consequences of repeal: When respondents were asked what would happen if Obamacare were repealed, even more people were stumped. Approximately 45 percent did not know that the A. C.",
        "With Hollywood studios audiences brand expansions mandated by nothing more than their own bottom line, it\u2019s understandable that we\u2019ve gotten a little dubious of sequels. Responses to the news of a beloved film going franchise tend to range from cautious optimism at best to bafflement and rage at worst. It feels like just yesterday that cries of \u201cWho could have asked for The Nut Job 2: Nutty By Nature? !\u201d echoed all across America, though it\u2019s possible that may have been just me.",
        "The first time Natalie Portman speaks in Jackie, Noah Oppenheim\u2019s arthouse about former first lady Jackie Kennedy Onassis, is three minutes into the movie. It\u2019s a week after John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination, and a journalist from Life magazine has come to the Kennedys\u2019 home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, to interview her. He offers his condolences. Portman, a startling amalgam of cheekbones, sharp brows, and a thicket of root hair, lets out a breathy, biting rebuke. \u201cHave you read what they\u2019ve been writing? Krock and Merriman and all the rest?\u201d she snaps, referring to journalists Arthur Krock and Merriman Smith.",
        "If a bunch of who\u2019d obsessively watched every Batman movie were equipped with a ridiculously excellent, eclectic Lego set, the result might be The Lego Batman Movie. It\u2019s everything you could want from a Batman movie and, in some respects, from any movie: goofy, very funny, imaginative, and packing a sincere message that has both personal and political implications. There are explosions and parties and dinosaurs and chases. And it\u2019s both nostalgic and contemporary \u2014 both Lego and Batman have entertained kids for generations \u2014 which means it\u2019s a movie for pretty much everyone.",
        "The Trump administration is now in the legal battle over its executive order banning people from seven countries, and nearly all refugees, from entering the United States. And it\u2019s reportedly not sure whether it\u2019s going to appeal the latest ruling, from a panel on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, to the Supreme Court. If Trump doesn\u2019t appeal, that mean the ban is dead? Hardly. The case hasn\u2019t even been resolved at the lowest level of the federal court system. And the 9th Circuit is considering reopening it. This is going to be a longer legal battle."
