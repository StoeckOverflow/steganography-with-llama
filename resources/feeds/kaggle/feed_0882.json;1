        "The first steps the Trump administration took on criminal justice \u2014 a trio of executive orders signed in early February \u2014 aren\u2019t really policy documents. They\u2019re basically a reassuring gesture to law enforcement officers. Dear Police, BLUE LIVES MATTER! Sincerely, Donald J. Trump. They\u2019re symbolic, but that doesn\u2019t make them pointless. Trump is picking a side in a culture war that\u2019s arisen in the past few years, with advocates for racial justice and improvements in relations on one side, and law enforcement officers (and their supporters) who fear \u201c \u201d reforms on the other.",
        "The Senate is on track to confirm Rep. Tom Price ( ) as health and human services secretary late Thursday or early Friday morning. And at a moment when congressional Republicans are struggling to figure out what comes next, the Georgia legislator and former doctor already has a plan for how to abolish Obamacare. Price is the author of the Empowering Patients First Act, one of the most thorough and detailed proposals to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Once he\u2019s confirmed, he\u2019s expected to craft the Trump administration\u2019s plan for repealing and replacing the law.",
        "Thursday afternoon, Reuters reported that Donald Trump interrupted a phone call with Vladimir Putin to ask a basic question about relations. Specifically, he asked what New START, a nuclear arms agreement inked by the Obama administration, was. Once he heard the basics, he immediately informed Putin that he was against it. \u201cWhen Putin raised the possibility of extending the 2010 treaty, known as New START, Trump paused to ask his aides in an aside what the treaty was,\u201d the Reuters reporters, Jonathan Landay and David Rohde, write.",
        "A prescient passage from a forgotten book has been making the rounds since Donald Trump\u2019s election. It\u2019s plucked from a 1998 book titled Achieving our Country. The author is Richard Rorty, a liberal philosopher who died in 2007. The book consists of a series of lectures Rorty gave in 1997 about the history of leftist thought in America.",
        "One week ago, Beyonc\u00e9 announced that she was pregnant with twins in the most Beyonc\u00e9 fashion: with an Instagram post teasing a forthcoming highly referential photo essay on her website. Today, Amal Clooney \u2014 international human rights attorney and wife to George \u2014 announced that she was pregnant with twins in the most Amal Clooney fashion: by tipping off Julie Chen, host of The Talk, in an announcement that had absolutely no photos of the pregnant .",
        "President Donald Trump wants to do something about crime in America. He just doesn\u2019t know what, exactly, he wants to do yet. On Thursday, the day Jeff Sessions was sworn in as Trump\u2019s attorney general, Trump signed a series of executive orders that deal with these issues. But the orders don\u2019t change laws or even really create new policy.",
        "On Wednesday night, Americans got a very public glimpse at what President Donald Trump has promised to do millions of times over: an unauthorized immigrant\u2019s arrest and deportation in Phoenix, Arizona. The victim who caught the attention of media and protesters at the scene was a or mother of two American teenagers, Guadalupe Garc\u00eda de Rayos. She had been in the US, according to the New York Times, since the age of 14, when she came into the country illegally. According to her lawyer, she has already been deported. Garc\u00eda de Rayos was known to immigration authorities already.",
        "Senate Democrats have spent this week scrambling to fight the ultimately successful nomination of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and coming up with a strategy for vetting Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee. But this week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( ) invited this Vox reporter to his office on Capitol Hill to talk about something else entirely \u2014 the Super Bowl. No, not the game. Schumer wanted to talk about the Super Bowl ads.",
        "The aftershocks of Donald Trump winning the presidency have been rippling through Hollywood in waves. While some very visible shows of opposition to the new administration came from Meryl Streep\u2019s impassioned Golden Globes speech and constant jabs from SAG Award winners, a major player has since come out in a big way against Trump \u2014 or more specifically, Trump\u2019s sweeping, hotly contested immigration ban. The United Talent Agency \u2014 better known as UTA \u2014 announced on February 8 that it\u2019s canceling the company\u2019s traditional Oscars party.",
        "Kellyanne Conway has jumped into President Trump\u2019s ongoing, feud with Nordstrom department stores, which have stopped carrying his daughter Ivanka Trump\u2019s fashion line. \u201cGo buy Ivanka\u2019s stuff, is what I would tell you,\u201d Conway said on Fox & Friends, while standing at the podium in the White House briefing room on Thursday morning. The Nordstrom saga has now crossed the line from a somewhat vague conflict of interest (Trump seemed like he was defending his daughter, but his company, the Trump Organization, also owns the Ivanka Trump brand) to a seemingly more violation of federal ethics rules.",
        "President Trump\u2019s refugee and visa ban is still on hold \u2014 and its future isn\u2019t looking good. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals just rejected an attempt by the Justice Department to reinstate the ban, after District Judge James Robart put a temporary restraining order on it last week.",
        "Alcohol may not be the first thing that most Americans think of when they think of violent crime, but a growing body of research keeps proving that America\u2019s favorite drug is a big contributor to crime and violence. Consider the latest evidence: A new study, by researchers at the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California Davis, found that alcohol may be a much better predictor of future crime, including violent acts, than whether you have a criminal record at all. And that suggests that preventing alcohol abuse could play a big role in preventing future violence.",
        "The masterminds behind Cards Against Humanity (CAH) \u2014 the blackly comedic, risqu\u00e9, and politically tinged version of Apples to Apples that\u2019s become a staple at game nights \u2014 threw everyone for a loop earlier this week when they bought a Super Bowl ad. Shown locally in Chicago, home to the game\u2019s founders, the ad featured a potato with the word \u201cadvertisement\u201d written on it in black marker. That\u2019s right, a potato. The ad featured no branding of any kind, and sparked a lot of confusion among viewers, tech types, and CAH fans.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, may be in a lot of trouble. Late Thursday night, the Washington Post reported that Flynn had called Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak on December 29, the same day that Obama had slapped new sanctions on Russia in retaliation for its hack of the US election. The conversation covered the sanctions, and, according to two officials, suggested that the Trump administration would be rolling back the sanctions in the future.",
        "It turns out Donald Trump may not be looking for a fight with China after all. Just weeks after questioning a cornerstone of Washington\u2019s diplomatic relationship with Beijing, Trump used a Thursday night phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping to say that he would honor the \u201cOne China\u201d policy that has kept ties between the two superpowers on an even keel since 1979. In December, Trump had raised doubts about his commitment to the agreement \u2014 and infuriated many in Beijing \u2014 by speaking by phone with Taiwanese President Tsai .",
        "At 5 pm Friday, CNN\u2019s website splashed an exclusive headline \u2014 \u201cUS investigators corroborate some aspects of the Russia dossier\u201d \u2014 in what sounded like a major development in the unconfirmed allegations that the Russian government had blackmail material on President Donald Trump. But it wasn\u2019t quite that. There was no confirmation of the alleged sex tape of Trump and prostitutes, or any major headway on rumors that Trump\u2019s aides were working with foreign nationals during the election \u2014 or anything that \u201crelates to the salacious allegations,\u201d or even Trump, for that matter, CNN reported.",
        "A presidential transition is an inherently uncertain time to be a federal employee. New leaders must be appointed. Potential budget and staff cuts loom menacingly. There\u2019s a lot of flux. But it\u2019s increasingly clear that President Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the federal government is smashing the norms of transition right and left. Look no further than what\u2019s happening at the Food and Drug Administration. The agency has become the perfect encapsulation of a transition gone awry.",
        "Yes, it\u2019s the dead of winter. And yes, temperatures will be around freezing in much of the United States. But there are reasons \u2014 three, to be exact \u2014 to be brave and venture outside. That\u2019s because Friday night there will be a trio of celestial treats: a full moon, a penumbral lunar eclipse, and a comet. First, the full moon and eclipse. Tonight, the moon will pass through the Earth\u2019s penumbra \u2014 the outer region of the Earth\u2019s shadow \u2014 which will cast a gray shadow over the surface of the moon.",
        "The 59th annual Grammy Awards will air Sunday, February 12, on CBS, bringing with them a clash of musical titans, colliding musical genres, and tributes to Prince and George Michael. Adele and Beyonc\u00e9 are already the talk of the evening, as they\u2019ll go toe to toe in four categories. Both women are also performing, as part of a lineup that runs the music industry gamut, with appearances from pop divas like Lady Gaga and Katy Perry as well as Chance the Rapper, Metallica, Daft Punk, and many more.",
        "Even for President Donald Trump, the past 24 hours have been tumultuous. There was the court ruling that kept his most sweeping policy initiative (thus far) frozen. There was the ethical breach by a top aide who promoted Trump\u2019s daughter\u2019s products. There was a report that another top aide mischaracterized his contacts with the Russian ambassador. There was a reversal on Trump\u2019s stated plans for Taiwan policy aimed at pleasing China. There was a report that Trump paused a call with Vladimir Putin because he didn\u2019t know what a major nuclear arms treaty was.",
        "Close your eyes and try to remember the world as it existed as recently as January 2015. At the time, Ivanka Trump \u2014 a glamorous, former model and mother of young kids with some television experience and a family connection to a business \u2014 was a natural partner for Nordstrom, the luxury department store found in upscale malls, generally in the suburbs of big cities. The Ivanka Trump clothing line was and progressive without being radical.",
        "Resistance to the Trump administration has taken the form of rallies, speeches, fundraisers, boycotts, fervent Facebook posts, a sea of knitted pink hats. It\u2019s been loud, determinedly visible, and often furious. So if you walk through the stark halls of New York City\u2019s Museum of Modern Art, you might not immediately peg it as a site of fiery protest. But thanks to some pointed tweaks to the museum\u2019s most iconic exhibit \u2014 the 1880s \u2014 1950s collection \u2014 that\u2019s exactly what the museum has become.",
        "The five documentaries nominated in the Best Documentary Feature category at the 2017 Oscars are unusually eclectic \u2014 and unusually urgent. Dealing with topics including race, mass incarceration, autism, and the European migrant crisis, they might all be seen as \u201cissue documentaries,\u201d movies that challenge the viewer to reconfigure the ways they understand the world. But they\u2019re also all very different, and none of them are totally conventional. Life, Animated, about a family learning to navigate their son\u2019s autism, is the most documentary, a story told by its subjects.",
        "Hundreds of people shouted down Rep. Jason Chaffetz ( ) at a town hall he held in his home district on Thursday night, with many yelling \u201cDo your job!\u201d at the chair of the House Oversight Committee. Cong Chaffetz Town Hall crowd chanting \u201dDo your job!\u201d He\u2019s having a hard time answering over crowd noise @UtahIndivisible @IndivisibleTeam pic. twitter. \u2014 Kyung Lah (@KyungLahCNN) February 10, 2017 Chaffetz has come under fire for taking few actions against either Donald Trump\u2019s international business empire and the potential conflicts of interest it creates, or pushing Trump to release his tax returns.",
        "It began as an unpaid modeling gig. A decade ago, Munira Ahmed met with photographer Ridwan Adhami to shoot photos for the Illume magazine, a publication focused on the lives of Muslims in America. Now a likeness of her face has become one of the most popular protest images following President Donald Trump\u2019s election. \u201cThe concept was to have me standing in front of where the New York Stock Exchange Building is, and the image was supposed to be more of that, really. There was an American flag that used to hang over it.",
        "Donald Trump wants to start building a wall across the border right away, but it\u2019s still not at all clear how much this would cost. On Friday, Reuters reported the highest estimate yet: a possible $21. 6 billion price tag for a \u201cseries of fences and walls\u201d that would take more than three years to build, according to a leaked Department of Homeland Security internal report.",
        "The judicial branch is officially resisting the Trump administration. Since Friday, when a federal judge put Trump\u2019s executive order banning visa holders from seven countries and nearly all refugees from entering the US, the president has issued a steady stream of invective at the judiciary \u2014 claiming the judge undermined national security and blaming him for hypothetical future terrorist attacks. He\u2019s taunted the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for taking more than a day to issue a ruling he claimed was an \u201ceasy D.",
        "The president of the United States has, legally speaking, a ton of power. He can fire the head of the country\u2019s federal investigative agency. He can decide, unilaterally, to give information to foreign leaders. He has essentially unconstrained authority to use nuclear weapons however he sees fit. So what would happen if the president were to \u2026 not be in his right mind? Months into his presidency, President Donald Trump\u2019s impulsiveness, willingness to contradict himself or his aides, and apparent heedlessness for consequences isn\u2019t just a matter of personality.",
        "Garry Kasparov knows what it is to oppose an authoritarian ruler. The longtime world chess champion was arrested twice in his native Russia for opposing Vladimir Putin. Since 2013, he has lived with family in exile in New York City, and is now the chair of the Human Rights Foundation. Winter Is Coming, Kasparov\u2019s prescient book detailing Putinism\u2019s rise and transnational menace, came out in paperback recently. Deep Thinking, his new book on chess and artificial intelligence, comes out May 2. A Ronald Reagan and John McCain supporter, Kasparov is a critic of Trumpism.",
        "When the 2017 Grammy Awards are held on Sunday, February 12, only a handful of winners will be announced during the ceremony that airs on live TV. Related Beyonc\u00e9 dominates the 2017 Grammy nominations with 9 nods for Lemonade But the Grammys will hand out awards in literally dozens of less glamorous categories before the live broadcast begins. Just what are these categories? What\u2019s being rewarded? Read on. 1) Why are there so many categories? The Grammys are a massive awards show."
