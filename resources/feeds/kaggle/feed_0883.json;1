        "The 2017 Grammy Awards handed out 84 awards to the music industry\u2019s best and brightest on Sunday. The major awards were handed out during the televised broadcast, but many were handed out before the big show began. The big winner of the night was Adele, who took home five Grammys, including Record of the Year and Song of the Year for \u201cHello,\u201d and, in a major upset, beat out Beyonc\u00e9 for Album of the Year (25).

        "When Donald Trump was on the campaign trail, he promised to create more jobs in America if he became president. One person who\u2019s already benefitting from that promise \u2014 in a way Trump surely didn\u2019t intend \u2014 is Melissa McCarthy, who\u2019s landed a new gig impersonating White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Saturday Night Live.",
        "On January 31, Reuters released a survey that said 49 percent of Americans approved of President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration and refugees. Just the day before, Rasmussen, another pollster, found 57 percent of voters supported it. Then on Sunday, CBS News published a poll showing that just 45 percent of the country supported Trump\u2019s executive order and 51 percent opposed it. That was followed by yet another poll from Morning Consult on Wednesday finding that the country approves of the order \u2014 by a wide margin. What\u2019s going on here?",

They bring the little feline to the big man seated at a nearby table. In his large hands, he cradles the kitten, clicking and tutting at it to see if it might rouse itself. He listens for breath.

        "Every Sunday, we pick a new episode of the week. It could be good. It could be bad. It will always be interesting. You can read the archives here. The episode of the week for February 5 through 11 is \u201cChapter \u201d the 10th episode of the third season of The CW\u2019s Jane the Virgin. (Spoiler alert, etc. and so on.) When Jane the Virgin isn\u2019t sharing warm family stories or wrenching out its audience\u2019s heart, it\u2019s layering storyline twists on top of each other and twisting them into complicated knots.",
        "The 2017 Grammy Awards will take place on Sunday, February 12, with the Recording Academy giving out trophies in 84 categories. Most of these categories are divided by genre (rock, country, rap, etc.) but four of them \u2014 Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist \u2014 are open to music from every genre. Beyonc\u00e9 leads the nominations with nine nods for her monumental hit Lemonade; it\u2019s nominated in the Album, Record, and Song of the Year categories, with the latter two nominations for \u201cFormation.",
        "Last July, a sharply dressed man named Frank Gaffney walked onto the stage of a crowded convention center in downtown Denver and proceeded to calmly warn his audience that Muslims were working to conquer America from the inside. Speaking without notes at a glass lectern, Gaffney \u2014 who worked, decades ago, as a Pentagon official in the Reagan administration \u2014 told the audience that political leaders from both parties had spent years covering up the true threat to the US. It didn\u2019t come from terrorists acting in the name of Islam. It came from Islam itself.",
        "Are we in a constitutional crisis? Well, no. As silly as the president declaring \u201cSEE YOU IN COURT\u201d in all caps on Twitter is, it\u2019s not exactly a sign that he\u2019s willing to bypass the judiciary altogether, which really would portend a crisis. But with Trump tweeting attacks on \u201c judges,\u201d and warning that decisions contrary to his wishes could lead to terrorist attacks, and Customs and Border Patrol officials at the nation\u2019s airports initially ignoring court orders and according to some reports doing so on orders from the White House, it\u2019s an understandable worry to have.",
        "LGBTQ organizations sent out a public letter on Monday to President Donald Trump\u2019s administration making a single plea: Please keep a guidance, from the previous Obama administration, that protects transgender students\u2019 rights in public schools. The letter, from major LGBTQ advocacy groups, argues: These guidance documents, addressing important issues such as sexual violence prevention and response, bullying and harassment, and the needs and rights of transgender students, provide practical answers to schools on issues they face every day.",

        "Beyonc\u00e9 has never been shy about how fantastic she is, but lately she\u2019s been really getting into the goddess imagery. Two weeks ago, she announced that she\u2019s pregnant with twins in a photo essay filled with copious visual references to Venus, the Virgin Mary, and the African goddess Mami Wata. Related Watch: Beyonc\u00e9 invokes sainthood, motherhood in a powerful Grammys performance And on Sunday night at the Grammys, she performed Lemonade\u2019s \u201cLove Draught\u201d and \u201cSandcastles\u201d in a virtuoso piece that drew heavily from multiple religious iconographies. Let\u2019s take a look a few of them.",
        "The Oroville Dam in northern California is the tallest dam in the United States, rising 770 feet high. It holds back a reservoir containing 1. 1 trillion gallons of water, supplying farms and cities across the state. It\u2019s a vital piece of infrastructure. But over the past week, the aging dam has also became a serious threat. On Sunday, authorities ordered some 188, 000 people around Oroville to evacuate their homes over concerns that the dam\u2019s emergency spillway could fail and an onrush of water out of the reservoir could flood nearby towns and roads.",
        "\u201cWhy can\u2019t therapists do something about a psychopath getting his dirty little fingers on the nuclear codes?\u201d a patient asked me. It was a week after the presidential election. There was anguish in my patient\u2019s voice. I put on my air and intoned, \u201cI hear how upset you are at what\u2019s happening in the country and that people who should know better aren\u2019t taking care of you the way they should \u2026 \u201d She said, \u201cPrecisely, I feel so let down. \u201d We were back on safe ground.

Jeff Sessions ( ) to a federal judgeship, McConnell ordered her to be silent, and Republicans voted to rebuke Warren for violating the Senate\u2019s Rule 19, which holds that no senator can insult another senator during proceedings.",
        "Few Trump surrogates have been as effective at defending their boss as Kellyanne Conway. As Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager turned senior adviser, she\u2019s distinguished herself as a notoriously difficult interview, effortlessly dodging pointed questions and derailing segments that might hurt her boss. That evasiveness, along with her \u201cBowling Green massacre\u201d and \u201calternative facts\u201d controversies, has made her a popular target for criticism and parody. But Conway\u2019s ability to avoid answering even basic questions about Trump\u2019s positions or statements demonstrates real skill.",
        "President Donald Trump has lied about almost every major political topic imaginable \u2014 unemployment numbers, the crime rate, voter fraud, and even the weather during his inauguration speech. The lies have gotten to be so ridiculous that John Oliver took a break from his usual style of segment to focus on Trump\u2019s deceit.",
        "Donald Trump has long talked about reining in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which is in charge of enforcing federal laws on air and water pollution. It\u2019s a top priority for his supporters in the industry. But there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty over what, exactly, this will look like. Trump himself has been all over the map on the agency\u2019s future. In Congress, there are bills floating around that would do everything from abolish the EPA to merely curb its powers at the margins.",
        "An Oklahoma state legislator, Rep. Justin Humphrey, is pushing a bill that would require a woman to get written permission from her sexual partner if she wants to have an abortion. The Supreme Court already struck down a very similar bill two decades ago, which means Humphrey\u2019s bill would have almost no chance of holding up in court if it ever became law. So why is Humphrey trying to pass it anyway?",
        "The Trump administration appears to be putting together a new and improved version of its executive order banning people from seven countries (and nearly all refugees) from entering the United States. The original order, signed January 27, was in effect for only a week before being put on hold by a federal judge in Washington. Despite personal appeals (or, rather, Twitter threats) from Trump himself, the administration wasn\u2019t able to get the Ninth Circuit to allow the ban to go back into effect \u2014 and its prospects don\u2019t look terrific going forward, either.",
        "Every year, the biggest stars in music get together to watch each other perform, walk a red carpet, and balance an armload of golden gramophone statuettes. And every year, the actual presentation of Grammy awards becomes less and less important. Though the Recording Academy hands out 84 categories\u2019 worth of awards every year, only the biggest get handed out during the show, and even those get pressed for time.",
        "President Donald Trump signed his first significant piece of legislation on Tuesday, repealing an rule that forced energy and mining companies to disclose any payments they made abroad. \u201cThis is a big signing,\u201d Trump said, \u201ca very important signing. \u201d That part\u2019s. .. debatable. Outside of a few firms like Exxon Mobil \u2014 which once lobbied against the rule and whose former CEO Rex Tillerson is now Trump\u2019s secretary of state \u2014 it\u2019s hard to find too many people overjoyed that this regulation is dead.",
        "The frontrunner to replace fired National Security Adviser Michael Flynn is basically the . The Washington Post reports that Vice Adm. Robert Harward, a onetime Navy SEAL and former deputy commander of US Central Command who served under current Secretary of Defense James Mattis, is the leading contender to succeed Flynn. If Harward gets the post, it would be a clear signal that the grownups on the Trump team are stepping in to make sure that the person who replaces the fired national security adviser can provide some calm and stability to the fractious White House.",
        "When White House adviser Kellyanne Conway told the audience of Fox & Friends to \u201cgo buy Ivanka\u2019s stuff\u201d last week, referring to President Trump\u2019s daughter, it seemed like a clear violation of government ethics rules.

        "With National Security Adviser Michael Flynn already forced to resign due to scandal, there are rumors of another White House in the works. Those rumors grow to a roar if you surf to today\u2019s Breitbart report by Matthew Boyle, which quotes at least three \u201csources close to the president\u201d who claim that Chief of Staff Reince Priebus\u2019s future is \u201cin doubt. \u201d Boyle\u2019s anonymous sources paint a picture in which Priebus\u2019s bumbling is the primary reason for the Trump administration\u2019s rocky start.

        "America\u2019s doctors have finally admitted it: Their pharmaceutical tools to treat one of patients\u2019 most common ailments don\u2019t work. Lower back pain is one of the most frequent reasons people visit the doctor. Yet doctors are finding drugs should actually often be the last line of treatment for it.

        "It wasn\u2019t very long ago that the romantic comedy was a mainstay of Hollywood\u2019s annual box office strategy. As recently as 2005, the Wedding Crashers was the sixth biggest movie of the year, and since then, movies like Knocked Up, The Proposal, and Silver Linings Playbook (a \u201cquality drama\u201d that tried to pretend it wasn\u2019t a ) have crossed the $100 million mark in the US without breaking a sweat.

        "Everybody knows that Donald Trump isn\u2019t conventionally qualified to be president of the United States. But as a candidate, he appealed to people\u2019s distaste for the conventional political system, and a segment of the public had faith in his management skills, figuring he would do what any business genius would do \u2014 surround himself with talent. \u201cI am self funding and will hire the best people,\u201d he wrote in April, \u201cnot the biggest donors!\u201d The fact that his national security adviser couldn\u2019t make it four weeks before being forced to resign tells you something about that \u201cbest people\u201d claim.",

        "Donald Trump\u2019s presidency didn\u2019t even make it a month before one of his top aides resigned in scandal. After days of \u201cdrip, drip, drip\u201d leaks about just what National Security Adviser Michael Flynn may have said to the Russian ambassador during the transition, Flynn resigned Monday night. With Flynn\u2019s resignation, the Trump administration has made history \u2014 Flynn\u2019s tenure in the office is the shortest of anyone\u2019s since the position of national security adviser was created.

        "One evening in October 2015, my Russian friend Valera and I went to the movies in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk. There was a multiplex not far from his apartment, and with a dozen movies to choose from, we decided to see The Martian. As we walked out of the movie, I asked how he liked it. To my surprise, he began fuming about a scene I hadn\u2019t thought twice about: a plot point in which the Americans ask China, not Russia, for help in getting a powerful enough rocket to return to Mars."
