        "Why is the attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, being forced to justify to a Texas judge why and how she is doing her job? In the latest instance of the corporate takeover of the First Amendment \u2014 and other constitutional rights \u2014 Exxon Mobil, the world\u2019s largest oil and gas corporation, has invented a constitutional right to obstruct state investigations into allegations of fraud.",
        "Maybe your feminism says Valentine\u2019s Day is an empty ritual of patriarchal capitalism that reinforces harmful gender norms and shames people who are single or who otherwise don\u2019t meet society\u2019s heteronormative, cisgender, monogamous expectations of romance. That\u2019s cool! Or maybe your feminism says we should reclaim Valentine\u2019s Day to celebrate all kinds of love between all kinds of people, including close friendships. That\u2019s cool too! Or maybe no matter what you think of Valentine\u2019s Day (or feminism) you\u2019d still enjoy sending some fun cards to your feminist friends or significant other( s) this February 14.",
        "Valentine\u2019s Day is one of those holidays people hate to love or love to hate. Its very nature as a celebration of romantic love \u2014 not to mention its reputation as a Hallmark holiday \u2014 puts you in a box: Single? No conventional celebration for you. In a relationship? Here\u2019s a holiday with expectations (and in many cases, some complicated feelings regarding gender norms, feminism, and patriarchal standards). But you know what won\u2019t let you down? Music about love \u2014 or the lack of it.",
        "President Trump\u2019s Russia problem is getting even worse. Late Wednesday night, the Washington Post reported that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had met with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak twice during the 2016 campaign, when he was serving as a Trump advisor. This is despite the fact that Sessions said in his confirmation hearing that \u201cI did not have communications with the Russians\u201d \u2014 while under oath. This is a devastating revelation, as Sessions is nominally in charge of the FBI \u2014 which is investigating the links between Trump\u2019s team and Russia.",
        "Andrew Puzder is out. On Wednesday, Donald Trump\u2019s pick for labor secretary announced that he would be withdrawing his name from consideration, according to the Associated Press. The withdrawal comes amid reports that several Republican senators were refusing to support Puzder, and it makes him the first Cabinet nominee in Donald Trump\u2019s administration to go down in flames. Republicans revolted against Puzder, CEO of the conglomerate CKE Holdings, amid two particularly scandals \u2014 a revelation that he\u2019d hired an undocumented immigrant and failed to pay employer taxes, and an ugly divorce in which his accused him of assaulting her.",
        "Biotechnology has advanced so rapidly over the past few years that scientists can now edit the genomes of plants and animals with precision. Using new techniques like researchers have already shown they can alter genes to create hornless cattle or mushrooms that don\u2019t brown easily. But the really big question \u2014 the stuff of \u2014 is whether we\u2019ll use tools on people to wipe out heritable diseases or to enhance human capabilities. It\u2019s no longer a question of whether we\u2019ll be able to create \u201cdesigner babies\u201d: The technology is improving at a stunning pace.",
        "The Trump administration issued its first Obamacare regulation early Wednesday morning. The document essentially outlines the rules that insurers need to play by if they want to sell coverage on the marketplaces. The rule suggests that the Trump administration wants to keep the marketplaces running but is also all right with enrollment shrinking in 2018. The summary: Health insurers are happy with this rule because they say it makes it harder for people to wait until they are sick to buy coverage.",
        "President Trump has said that any unauthorized immigrant in the US should be deportable. But he has also said that the 750, 000 immigrants who\u2019ve been protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program \u2014 which grants protection from deportation and work permits to young adults who came to the US as children \u2014 are \u201cterrific\u201d people who shouldn\u2019t worry about their futures. Those two positions always conflicted.",
        "White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer was asked during his afternoon press briefing yesterday if he could still confirm that \u201cnobody on the Trump campaign, not even Gen. Flynn, had any contact with the Russians before the election. \u201d His answer was, well, awkward: \u201cI don\u2019t have any \u2014 there\u2019s nothing that would conclude me \u2014 that anything different has changed with respect to that time period. \u201d Thanks to a report by Michael Schmidt, Mark Mazzetti, and Matt Apuzzo for the New York Times, we now know that Spicer got it wrong.",
        "New Jersey just passed one of the nation\u2019s most comprehensive laws to combat the growing opioid and heroin crisis. The law will reduce the supply of drugs that patients getting their first opioid prescription can get from 30 days to five days. It also will require doctors to talk to patients about how addictive the drugs are. For addicts whose doctors have recommended treatment, the law also mandates that insurers offer 180 days of coverage without preauthorization.",
        "Timmy Morrison was delivered by emergency weighing in at 3 pounds, 9 ounces. Doctors put him under anesthesia within a week and into surgery within a month. Some of the contents of his stomach sometimes made their way to his lungs. Workers in the intensive care unit frequently needed to resuscitate him. He arrived seven weeks premature \u2014 but, in a way, just at the right time. Six months before Timmy was born, President Barack Obama signed a sweeping health care law that would come to bear his name.",
        "Usually, the sudden resignation of a top Cabinet official just 24 days into a presidential administration and after intrigue involving the Russian ambassador would lead to congressional hearings. But on Tuesday, House Republicans weren\u2019t interested in investigating the resignation of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. Rep. Devin Nunes, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, said his committee wouldn\u2019t be looking into conversations between President Trump and Flynn. Those conversations, Nunes said, would be covered by executive privilege, the president\u2019s right to keep conversations with his advisers secret from Congress and the courts.",
        "Verizon had good news for consumers this weekend, as it announced a new plan: unlimited talk, text, and data for just $80 per month. This is probably not a move Verizon wanted to make \u2014 since 2011, it\u2019s been charging customers by the gigabyte. But Verizon\u2019s hand was forced by its smaller rivals Sprint and which introduced unlimited data plans last summer (albeit with some restrictions). It\u2019s just the latest sign that competition is working in the wireless industry. It vindicates the Obama administration\u2019s 2011 decision to block AT&T from acquiring \u2014 a move strongly supported by liberals.",
        "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will have his first meeting with President Trump today in what was supposed to be a moment of triumph for the Israeli leader. But the Trump Netanyahu will see in Washington is not the Trump of November, nor the Trump of the campaign trail. Netanyahu had thought he was getting a stridently president who would green light (or at least not block) new in the West Bank, immediately move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and tear up, or seriously rework, the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran.",
        "On March 31, activists plan to march on Washington to defend what they call their \u201clegal right to make informed, voluntary vaccine choices. \u201d So far, a little more than 300 people have signed up to march with this group of pseudoscience promoters. But the \u201ccall to action\u201d at this moment in history signals something alarming: The movement seems to be energized under President Donald Trump. And that\u2019s dangerous, given that lately, vaccine skeptics have been persuading more parents in a number of states to refuse shots for their children.",
        "Sometimes, it\u2019s hard to believe that it\u2019s been less than four weeks since President Donald Trump took office. In that time, the White House has been mired in scandal after scandal and controversy after controversy, from Trump\u2019s botched immigration order to the resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn to new questions about the administration\u2019s ties to Russia. The latest scandal surrounding Flynn and the Russia connections led longtime journalist Dan Rather to conclude in a Facebook post, \u201cWatergate is the biggest political scandal of my lifetime, until maybe now.",
        "The fourth week of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has been tumultuous, with his top national security official being forced out due to scandal, reports that members of his campaign staff and associates had contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials last year, and various factions of his White House apparently knifing each other in the press. Meanwhile, an initial flurry of new policy actions has slowed to a crawl, his major immigration order remains blocked in the courts, and a significant legislative achievement remains far away.",
        "David Friedman, President Trump\u2019s pick to be the next US ambassador to Israel, appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Thursday for his confirmation hearing. It was anything but routine. As Friedman began his opening remarks, a young Palestinian man stood up and shouted, \u201cMr. Friedman said that Palestinian refugees don\u2019t have a claim to the land. . .. My grandfather was exiled, was kicked out, by state officials.",
        "Minutes after President Donald Trump\u2019s press conference concluded on Thursday afternoon, CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper called it \u201cunhinged\u201d and \u201cwild. \u201d Here are nine quotes from the presser that back up that assessment. 1) At the beginning of the press conference, Trump blasted intelligence community leaks about his campaign\u2019s alleged contact with Russia as \u201cfake news. \u201d A reporter asked Trump to clarify whether he meant the leaks were fake. Here\u2019s the exchange: REPORTER: I just want to get you to clarify this very important point.",
        "From 2012 to 2015, Evelyn Farkas served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia. Since leaving office, she\u2019s been raising the alarm that there was more to the strange relationship between Trumpland and Russia than the public knew. Maybe even much more. This week, she was proven right. We spoke Wednesday, and the relief was evident in her voice. Far from being concerned over the new revelations, she\u2019s comforted that the ties are finally being made public and broad pressure is finally being applied for more investigations.",
        "President Trump\u2019s bizarre, rambling news conference hit an unrivaled low at the mention of an issue that\u2019s continually defined the president down: race. April Ryan, a black reporter with American Urban Radio Networks in Baltimore, asked Trump if he plans to meet and work with the Congressional Black Caucus \u2014 a perfectly legitimate question from a political reporter. His answer was not so legitimate. Immediately, Trump treated Ryan as if she were personally aligned with the Congressional Black Caucus \u2014 even as she insisted that she\u2019s \u201cjust a reporter.",
        "The first thing President Donald Trump repeals and replaces is going to be his own executive order on immigration. Both Trump, in a press conference, and the Department of Justice, in a court filing, said Thursday that the president is abandoning the order he signed January 27, banning all visa holders from seven countries and nearly all refugees from entering the United States. The ban was only in effect for a week before being put on hold by a federal court \u2014 and judges around the country have been less than sympathetic to the administration\u2019s arguments for its constitutionality.",
        "Deep uncertainty and serious divisions within the Republican coalition about the way forward on Obamacare have surfaced in the new Congress, and they\u2019ve put the future of repeal and replace in doubt. It\u2019s become evident that there is little GOP unity on how much a replacement plan should cost, how to pay for it, whether the Medicaid expansion should be rolled back, or how to fix the individual markets.",
        "Around the time of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, Ben Wikler began visiting the DC offices of Senate Democrats to press them to fight harder against the new president. The director of the progressive group MoveOn. org, Wikler wanted to know if they would do everything they could to block the Republican agenda. He got a lukewarm reception. \u201cThey were really nervous about objecting to routine and procedure because it might disrupt the comity of the body,\u201d Wikler said.",
        "On Thursday, President Trump nominated a law school dean as the next secretary of labor after his first choice for the job went down in flames. R. Alexander Acosta, currently the dean of Florida International University College of Law, served as assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice under President George W. Bush. Acosta is the first Hispanic person nominated to Trump\u2019s cabinet. \u201cI just want to begin by mentioning that the nominee for secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta,\u201d Trump said at a press conference Thursday afternoon.",
        "President Trump\u2019s press conference Thursday had many unbelievable moments. But one of the most shocking was an exchange in which Trump asked a black reporter to set up a meeting for him with the Congressional Black Caucus, and asked if the caucus members were \u201cfriends\u201d of hers. April Ryan, the White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks in Baltimore, asked Trump whether he would include the Congressional Black Caucus in conversations about his \u201curban agenda\u201d for the \u201cinner city.",
        "At home, President Trump is flailing in the face of three separate scandals stemming from his administration\u2019s close ties to the Kremlin. Abroad, his own appointees are busy creating another problem \u2014 brazenly undermining his stated policy on Russia in trips to foreign countries. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who said that the list of threats to America \u201cstarts with Russia\u201d during his Senate confirmation hearing, was in Brussels for a meeting of NATO defense officials. During a press conference, Mattis contradicted Trump on two major Russia issues.",
        "Presidents often clash with branches of the federal government. Most famous, perhaps, is the high levels of mistrust between President John F. Kennedy and the Pentagon in dealing with the Cuban missile crisis. The Pentagon favored an invasion of Cuba and thought Kennedy was naive and shy about the Soviet threat. Kennedy favored restraint and thought the Pentagon officials, left to their own devices, would bring the world to nuclear war. Kennedy\u2019s greatest success, historian Robert Dallek writes in an Atlantic retrospective, was fending off not the Soviets but the voices that contradicted him inside the Pentagon.",
        "There\u2019s a huge amount of discussion these days about the opioid epidemic in America: how the overdose rate got so shockingly high and what should be done to stop it. A common belief is that opioid addiction often begins with a single prescription from a doctor: Patients seek relief from some minor problem like a toothache or back pain, leave with a prescription, and wind up hooked. But there\u2019s not much actual evidence tying doctors\u2019 prescription patterns to individual patients\u2019 use of opioids or complications caused by the drugs later on.",
        "President Donald Trump is outraged about the number of intelligence leaks to the press since he took office \u2014 seemingly in large part because the news reports forced the White House to fire former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. His concerns have reached the ears of top congressional investigators. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the Republican chair of the House Oversight Committee, and Republican House Judiciary Chair Rep. Bob Goodlatte sent a letter this week to the Department of Justice\u2019s inspector general, Michael Horowitz, requesting an immediate investigation into intelligence leaks."
