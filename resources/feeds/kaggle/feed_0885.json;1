        "As the White House staff tries to put together a budget for President Donald Trump, they face a fundamental problem. Trump has promised to cut taxes, increase spending on the military and infrastructure, and avoid cuts to Social Security and Medicare. The only way to do that without producing an exploding budget deficit is to assume a big increase in economic growth. And Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal reports that Trump is planning to do just that \u2014 by making things up.",
        "During his chaotic press conference on Thursday, President Donald Trump was on the defensive about his relationship with Russia. One key point he made, attempting to prove that that he wasn\u2019t soft on Moscow, was to paint the previous administration as weak in handling the Kremlin \u2014 by claiming again that Hillary Clinton gave Russia \u201c20 percent of our uranium\u201d as secretary of state.",
        "President Donald Trump\u2019s Thursday press conference was a cascade of lies, contradictions, and non sequiturs \u2014 so it might have been easy to miss, slipped into a dig at pro \u2014 Affordable Care Act protesters, a line that inadvertently reveals how Trump sees politics and government as a whole: We\u2019ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It\u2019s a disaster. You can say, \u201cOh, Obamacare!\u201d \u2014 They fill up our rallies with people that, you wonder how they get there, but they\u2019re not the Republican people that the representatives are representing.",
        "The Department of Homeland Security considered \u2014 but says it rejected \u2014 letting governors in 11 states decide whether to deputize their National Guards to enforce immigration law, including helping to detain and deport unauthorized immigrants. The memo, first reported by the Associated Press Friday, matches the description of a memo leaked to Vox. The memo lays out several possible policies to help implement President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order regarding border enforcement. The White House strongly denied the report, calling it \u201c100% not true.",
        "Of all Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks, it\u2019s hard to find anyone who\u2019s been more overtly hostile toward the agency he\u2019s about to lead than Scott Pruitt has been toward the Environmental Protection Agency. Pruitt made no secret of this; during his tenure as Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general, his bio page called him \u201ca leading advocate against the EPA\u2019s activist agenda.",
        "Republicans in Congress took several steps this week toward investigating President Trump\u2019s campaign and administrative ties to Russia. Those steps still fall short of the most aggressive probes Congress can launch, but they have helped satisfy at least some of the Democrats who for months have accused GOP lawmakers of shielding Trump from scrutiny on a widening controversy. Congressional Democrats are continuing to call for Republicans to do more \u2014 a reflection of both the politics at play and the complicated degrees of investigative power that Congress can deploy on a given issue.",
        "At a raucous press conference on Thursday, President Trump faced a volley of questions about his and his inner circle\u2019s ties to Russia. At one point, he declared: \u201cI can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don\u2019t have any deals in Russia. \u201d And he\u2019s right. Trump has a long history of trying to do business in Russia, but despite many efforts and plenty of boasting and angling, he hasn\u2019t managed to land a single major real estate deal there. But that\u2019s only part of the picture.",
        "If nothing else, Big Little Lies, HBO\u2019s dive into the \u201dsalacious melodrama\u201d genre, captures the loneliness of car rides. Rating 3. 5 The vehicles are luxurious, sleek, elegant, and expensive. But the wealthy women who drive them always seem isolated. Their children might be having the best time in the back seat, but the mothers are always singularly focused and alone. Yes, that\u2019s because they\u2019re concentrating on the road. But Big Little Lies suggests it\u2019s also because, no matter where these women go or whom they surround themselves with, they\u2019re surprised to find they\u2019re ultimately alone with themselves.",
        "When the gorgeous Planet Earth II premiered in the UK in November, one clip in particular turned heads. As it begins, a baby iguana, newly hatched from an egg buried in sand, tentatively pokes its head out above the surface \u2014 and then launches itself into one of the most thrilling chase sequences ever to grace television, courtesy of the iguana\u2019s desire to live and a truly terrifying army of snakes. The drama of \u201cSnake Island\u201d \u2014 as the Vox Culture team calls it \u2014 would not be denied.",
        "PewDiePie, a. k. a. Swedish gaming vlogger Felix Kjellberg, is the most popular personality on YouTube. His videos of gaming reactions and cultural commentary have garnered him 53 million subscribers. He\u2019s so on YouTube and in gaming circles that in 2014, South Park made an episode about him. And his comedy style \u2014 characterized by Kjellberg reacting to \u201ccrazy\u201d or \u201cshocking\u201d or \u201cridiculous\u201d things with performative incoherence \u2014 has become a ubiquitous part of YouTube culture. In most of his videos, Kjellberg babbles nonsensically and screams a lot.",
        "At one point in the first half of Logan, the new Wolverine movie starring Hugh Jackman (who has sworn this will be his last time playing the character) the film\u2019s central players pause just long enough to watch the classic 1953 Western Shane on a hotel room TV. Rating 4. 5 They\u2019re on the run from people who are attempting to round up mutant children who were created in a lab. One of those children \u2014 dubbed Laura by the nurses at the lab \u2014 is technically Logan\u2019s daughter, though he\u2019s only just realized she exists.",
        "The US has a long history of discriminatory housing policies, which has entrenched communities of color in poor neighborhoods. And the one tool the federal government has to push back against these segregation patterns is the Fair Housing Act \u2014 specifically the part that says local communities that receive federal funds for affordable housing must \u201caffirmatively further\u201d fair housing. But for much of the law\u2019s lifetime, advocates say it has been toothless. So two years ago, the Obama administration tackled this issue by creating a new rule that leveraged the growing amount of racial disparity data.",
        "Allen Frances is a psychiatrist who wrote the rules for diagnosing personality disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The DSM is the No. 1 tool mental health professionals have for making diagnoses. Frances, a professor emeritus at Duke, doesn\u2019t mince words about what he thinks of mental health professionals who are now using the DSM to diagnose President Donald Trump with a mental disorder. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on is bullshit,\u201d he says. Some mental health experts believe Trump has a severe mental disorder Frances is talking about the recent Change.",
        "Political cartoonist Glenn McCoy is just the latest person to compare those who blocked President Trump\u2019s secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, from entering a public school last week to those who aimed to stop Ruby Bridges from becoming the first black child to desegregate the William Frantz Elementary School in Louisiana in 1960. Trump\u2019s defenders would be wise to stop this. While attempting to paint DeVos in a sympathetic light, as a brave pioneer, they\u2019re also unintentionally highlighting the deep racism that fueled the protests against Bridges.",
        "Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s manifesto on the future of Facebook begins with a capsule narration of human achievement. \u201cHistory is the story of how we\u2019ve learned to come together in ever greater numbers,\u201d Zuckerberg writes, \u201cfrom tribes to cities to nations. At each step, we built social infrastructure like communities, media and governments to empower us to achieve things we couldn\u2019t on our own. \u201d The Facebook CEO does not explicitly add his social network to that list of social infrastructure, but the rest of the letter makes clear that he wants to see it on there, and soon.",
        "Since 2014, China has been building islands in the middle of the South China Sea. What were once underwater reefs are now sandy islands complete with airfields, roads, buildings, and missile systems. In less than two years, China has turned seven reefs into seven military bases in the South China Sea, one of the most contentious bodies of water in the world. The sea is one of the most important areas of ocean in the world. It\u2019s estimated to hold 11 billion barrels of oil, 109 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 10 percent of the world\u2019s fisheries.",
        "Allowing some state governors to deputize the National Guard to help arrest and detain immigrants isn\u2019t the only step the Trump administration considered to carry out the president\u2019s executive order on immigration. The administration also sketched out plans for mandatory detention of asylum seekers; sending immigrants back to Mexico while their cases were still pending in immigration court; and making it much easier to deport unauthorized immigrants living in the US without a court hearing at all.",
        "A Cure for Wellness clocks in at 146 minutes long, and Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean, The Lone Ranger) and his Justin Haythe cram every one of those minutes with pure, undiluted silliness. Then they douse them in kerosene and light them on fire. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s a bad movie. (It\u2019s not really to say it\u2019s a good movie, either.) A Cure for Wellness is so bonkers that a evaluation seems beside the point. It\u2019s the sort of movie that can only be described by talking about other things: It\u2019s like Crimson Peak meets Mr.",
        "Republican legislators need a way to pay for their eventual Obamacare replacement plan. One leading contender is capping the tax exclusion for health insurance, which shows up in multiple replacement plans as well as recent interviews with legislators. It\u2019s going to be a huge fight. Right now, companies and their workers pay no taxes on health benefits. This means the federal government misses out on a lot of potential revenue \u2014 $260 billion in 2013, according to Congressional Budget Office data.",
        "According to the Wall Street Journal, the Trump administration\u2019s proposed revamp of its refugee and visa ban would make the ban easier to defend in court \u2014 but maybe not easy enough. The executive order President Trump signed on January 27, temporarily banning all people from seven countries and nearly all refugees from entering the United States, has been put on hold as judges around the country have questioned its constitutionality and enjoined its implementation.",
        "Every Sunday, we pick a new episode of the week. It could be good. It could be bad. It will always be interesting. You can read the archives here. The episode of the week for February 12 through 18 is \u201cGodspeed,\u201d the fourth episode of the second season of Syfy\u2019s The Expanse. In its first season, The Expanse always felt like it was hiding what was really going on in an elaborate shell game.",
        "On Monday, 11 Jewish community centers across the country were targeted with bomb threats. Outside St. Louis, a Jewish cemetery was desecrated: More than 100 tombstones were overturned and damaged. \u201cEnough already,\u201d Karen Aroesty, an League local leader, told a Fox news affiliate. \u201cThis is where your loved ones come to be safe in perpetuity, and the level of tension in the Jewish community is pretty high.",
        "Saturday night, President Donald Trump held a rally in Melbourne, Florida, where he attempted to defend his controversial \u201cMuslim ban\u201d executive order by pointing to the consequences of migration in Europe. He focused on an unspecified event that took place \u201clast night in Sweden\u201d: When you look at what\u2019s happening in Germany, when you look at what\u2019s happening last night in Sweden \u2014 Sweden! Who would believe this? Sweden! They took in large numbers, they\u2019re having problems like they never thought possible. The only problem is that nothing happened the prior night in Sweden.",
        "Milo Yiannopoulos finally went too far for conservatives. On Monday, he lost his book deal, and his speech at the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) was canceled. And on Tuesday, he resigned from the website Breitbart. But it wasn\u2019t his racism, sexism, transphobia, or other kinds of bigotry that led to Yiannopoulos\u2019s fall. Nope. After all that, it\u2019s comments apparently supporting child molestation that did Yiannopoulos in. Here\u2019s the backstory: Over the weekend, it was revealed that Yiannopoulos was invited to give a speech at CPAC, the biggest mainstream conservative conference in America.",
        "H. R. McMaster, an Army general, will be President Donald Trump\u2019s next national security adviser, according to an announcement on Monday afternoon. McMaster isn\u2019t exactly a household name, but he\u2019s among observers of the US military \u2014 and has a sterling reputation as a strategist, leader, and intellectual. McMaster\u2019s predecessor, retired Gen. Michael Flynn, had a (seemingly justified) reputation for being a loose cannon attracted to fringe political ideas. McMaster is the opposite \u2014 a careful scholar and successful general who\u2019s in the Washington foreign policy establishment.",
        "in snow, in remote locations close to the border, migrants have been braving temperatures and the danger of being stopped by border patrol agents to find the American dream \u2014 in Canada. Compared to February 2016, the number of asylum seekers crossing into Canada illegally has tripled this year, according to figures obtained by the Washington Post. The trend has been growing rapidly since the United States\u2019 election in November.",
        "Capturing Planet Earth is a video series from Vox Observatory about the evolution of the BBC\u2019s wildlife films. When the BBC launched its Natural History Unit in 1957 to produce radio and TV programs about wildlife, its film cameras could only run for 20 seconds at a time. There was no way to schedule airplane trips, and once a crew arrived at their remote location, they couldn\u2019t communicate with Bristol for weeks or review their footage.",
        "Economic events don\u2019t usually sneak up on Jim O\u2019Sullivan. He has won a prestigious forecasting competition \u2014 predicting jobs reports, inflation rates, and growth trends \u2014 for six consecutive years. MarketWatch, which runs the contest, says the odds of pulling off that streak by sheer guessing would be about 10 billion to 1. Which is to say, when something surprises O\u2019Sullivan, it\u2019s a big deal. Since November, it\u2019s happened twice.",
        "Friday morning, President Donald Trump gave a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference \u2014 in which he took shots at, of all things, the nation of Sweden. The president warned that some dire stuff was happening there as a result of mass Muslim immigration: Foreign terrorists will not be able to strike America if they cannot get into our country. And, by the way, take a look at what\u2019s happening in Europe, folks. ..Take a look at what happened in Sweden. I love Sweden. Great country, great people, I love Sweden. They understand I\u2019m right.",
        "Internet troll and Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos is in the news again \u2014 after he was caught defending the sexual abuse of children. Over the weekend, it was revealed that Yiannopoulos was invited to give a speech at the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) the biggest mainstream conservative conference in America. Shortly after, the conservative website Reagan Battalion resurfaced video footage of Yiannopoulos defending the idea of \u201c13 year olds\u201d having sex with \u201colder men,\u201d referencing his own story that he benefited from a priest molesting him when he was a teenager."
