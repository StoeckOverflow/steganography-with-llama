        "A prominent engineer named Susan Fowler has penned an explosive blog post describing her year as an Uber employee. She alleges that between her hiring in November 2015 and her departure in January 2017, she experienced a truly remarkable string of sexist incidents that \u2014 if proven \u2014 would give her grounds for a sexual harassment lawsuit, several times over. Fowler alleges that on her first day on her new team, her boss propositioned her for sex over company chat.",
        "Michael Flynn\u2019s resignation \u2014 under fire \u2014 as national security adviser has the larger question of Donald Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia back in the news. It\u2019s a story that centers on three big, but fundamentally unproven, allegations: that Trump is on the take from Russia, that he is somehow exposed to Russian blackmail material, that his campaign actively collaborated with the Russian government during the 2016 campaign, or some combination of the above. The evidence for those explosive charges is thin. What we have instead are a lot of small, unanswered questions.",
        "BOSTON \u2014 Scientists have long spoken up for causes like the proliferation of nuclear weapons and climate change. But with President Donald Trump in office, something\u2019s different. On Sunday, hundreds of scientists filled Boston\u2019s Copley Square at a rally, holding signs with statements like \u201cAlternative facts are the square root of negative one. \u201d Thousands are expected to show up at the March for Science in Washington, planned for April 22. \u201cWhen the proposed budget comes out . ..",
        "\u201cWhat about when you and your husband get divorced, and you meet someone else?\u201d She said when. The gynecologist\u2019s voice was steady and detached, but her lips pursed in a condescending smirk and her eyes gleamed. I was 25 years old and had married my best friend three years earlier. Everything about being married brought me joy. I certainly had no intention of getting divorced. She paused briefly before delivering the final blow. This story is republished from Narrative. ly \u201cWhat if Mr.",
        "Within moments of President Donald Trump finishing his freewheeling press conference Thursday, his campaign sent out the \u201cMainstream Media Accountability Survey\u201d: 25 questions polling Trump supporters on how the media has been treating the administration. \u201cYou know that I don\u2019t trust the media to report on anything we achieve,\u201d the campaign\u2019s email said. \u201cInstead, you \u2014 the American people \u2014 are our last line of defense against the media\u2019s hit jobs. You are our greatest asset in helping our movement deliver the truth to the American people.",
        "Twelve days after Donald Trump halted the US refugee program with his controversial executive order, Jenny Yang traveled to Capitol Hill to lobby Congress to challenge it. \u201cWe have a lot of concerns with the executive order,\u201d Yang said, with quiet understatement. She was standing in the hallway of the Cannon House Office Building breaking down those concerns for Harvey Sparks, the legislative assistant to Oklahoma Republican Rep. Steve Russell. A marble hallway is not an ideal spot in which to lobby for a cause.",
        "The Facebook Live video, recorded on Tuesday, opened with what looked like a happy family enjoying a car ride, singing along to a song by rapper Chief Keef as it played on the radio. Suddenly, the mood changed: Loud bangs popped in the background and the woman screamed \u2014 \u201cPlease! No!\u201d \u2014 in pain. When the hail of bullets calmed, a boy was fatally wounded, his aunt was seriously injured, and her boyfriend was dead. The details were exceptionally horrific \u2014 a after all, was shot and killed, and his pregnant aunt, whose unborn baby survived, was wounded.",
        "The Department of Homeland Security is officially putting the sweeping executive orders that President Donald Trump signed his first week in office into practice \u2014 giving the federal government nearly free rein to arrest, detain, and deport unauthorized immigrants wherever it finds them. On Monday, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly issued memos to senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that provide instructions for implementing two executive orders President Trump signed January 25, regarding immigration enforcement on the border and within the United States.",
        "South Korea is set to become the world leader in life expectancy by the end of the next decade. And the United States? Well, it\u2019s poised to lag behind other wealthy countries when it comes to progress in longevity. In a new study published in The Lancet, researchers predict that average life expectancy will reach beyond 90 years for South Korean women by 2030. Men there will also see big gains. A handful of other wealthy countries will get closer to becoming centenarians too, but these improvements won\u2019t be spread evenly.",
        "There are 549 key positions in President Donald Trump\u2019s administration that require Senate confirmation. Trump has yet to nominate anyone to 515 of them. According to Max Stier, the CEO of the nonpartisan Center for Presidential Transition, when it comes to political appointments, Trump is lagging behind almost every recent president \u2014 and he has a long way to go. Of course, presidential transition is always a difficult process. There are upward of 4, 000 positions that can be filled by presidential appointment, and no administration has handled this perfectly. But some transitions have been smoother than others.",
        "As the chief official White House photographer for President Barack Obama, Pete Souza spent eight years capturing snapshots of some of the most intimate and important moments in Obama\u2019s tenure. Now he\u2019s sharing those photos to create the Instagram version of a subtweet of President Donald Trump. It all began on January 21, the day after Trump\u2019s inauguration. When photos circulated showing that Trump had redecorated the Oval Office with golden drapes, Souza took to Instagram to let everyone know he preferred Obama\u2019s aesthetic choices. I like these drapes better than the new ones. Don\u2019t you think?",
        "Members of Congress meeting constituents in their district this week are likely to encounter an unusual dynamic: Obamacare supporters who suddenly seem to outnumber the law\u2019s opponents. The New York Times\u2019s Jonathan Martin wrote this weekend about a new reality dawning on congressional Republicans: Constituents who dislike Obamacare are no longer anywhere near as vocal as they used to be, while the health law\u2019s supporters are suddenly more energized than ever.",
        "As the Trump administration finds its feet, a fear of autocracy is in the air. Some spy the beginning of a sustained assault on our democratic order \u2014 envisioning a world in which \u201ckeeping the president happy\u201d becomes a widespread corporate goal, as the president metes out warnings on Twitter to companies that threaten his business interests. They sense disdain for constitutional limits on presidential power in Trump\u2019s attack on a \u201c judge\u201d who dared to issue a stay against his hastily issued executive order banning refugees.",
        "The very thought of yet another TV show, starring a comedian, set in and around the world of comedy or show business, could make viewers roll their eyes. We have Louie, 30 Rock, even Curb Your Enthusiasm. Do we really need another show like this? Crashing, HBO\u2019s new entry in this subgenre, is eager to change your mind. What makes the show so good is its dedication to chronicling every detail of the rise of a young comic, Pete, who\u2019s played by comic Pete Holmes.",
        "In just his first month in office, President Donald Trump has cost taxpayers almost $10 million in travel expenses, according to calculations from the Washington Post \u2014 meaning he\u2019s on track to far exceed the amount President Obama\u2019s travel cost in eight years. The figure for Trump\u2019s trips, calculated from an October 2016 Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimate of presidential travel costs to Florida, includes only the expenses associated with Trump\u2019s three trips to \u2014 which he\u2019s dubbed the \u201cwinter White House\u201d \u2014 since the inauguration.",
        "Donald Trump has been president for a month, and his supporters are already praising him for bringing back US coal mining jobs \u2014 even though he hasn\u2019t, really. Here\u2019s a sample quote from a Trump backer in Florida, via Jenna Johnson and David Weigel of the Washington Post: \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t gotten into office, 70, 000 miners would have been put out of work\u201d . .. \u201cI saw the ceremony where he signed that bill, giving them their jobs back, and he had miners with their hard hats and everything \u2014 you could see how happy they were.",
        "For decades, the Bank limped along at the margins of American politics, a rightfully obscure program regarded as neither particularly interesting nor important but sustained by and subject to the banal of interest group politics. It was criticized politically, to the extent it was criticized at all, mainly on environmental grounds as a funder of dirty energy projects. But a reformist presidential candidate by the name of Barack Obama also criticized it as an example of the kind of wasteful corporate welfare he thought the country shouldn\u2019t tolerate.",
        "A few weeks back, I wrote a piece about Donald Trump titled \u201cHow to stop an autocracy. \u201d The essay began with the premise that Trump has a will to power and a contempt for the basic norms and institutions of American democracy, and then explored how to limit the damage. The answer, basically, was that Congress needs to do its damn job. But after I wrote it, smart people argued the piece was built atop a mistake. Trump might have the will to power, but he doesn\u2019t have the discipline for it.",
        "On Wednesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said there\u2019s no argument: The Trump administration is ready to revoke a guidance that protects transgender students from discrimination in public schools. Spicer was disputing a New York Times report that there\u2019s been debate within the administration about whether the guidance should be revoked. His explanation: The president has maintained for a long time that this is a states\u2019 rights issue and not one for the federal government.",
        "The first step in finding life outside our own planet is to find a planet like our own: small, rocky, and at just the right distance from the star that liquid water could exist on its surface. That\u2019s why an announcement today from NASA is so exciting: The space agency, along with partners around the world, has found seven potentially planets orbiting a star 40 away.",
        "Chuck Grassley just can\u2019t escape death panels. Back in 2009, the Iowa senator suggested that the Affordable Care Act might create something akin to a \u201cdeath panel,\u201d where the government decides which patients survive. In remarks at a town hall, he seemed to endorse the idea that the health care law had a program meant to ration medical care. (It didn\u2019t.) This week, eight years later, Grassley had another town hall, and \u201cdeath panels\u201d came up again. But this time, the term meant something very different \u2014 because Obamacare supporters, not critics, were the ones saying it.",
        "Speculation about a potential massive Trump administration scandal has become rampant since last month\u2019s reports that Trump advisers were in regular contact with senior Russian intelligence officials during the campaign. We\u2019ve already had National Security Adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s resignation for lying about contacts with the Russian ambassador, and now it\u2019s been reported that Attorney General Jeff Sessions met with the ambassador too and didn\u2019t disclose it to Congress.",
        "Mikhail Fishman is the of the Moscow Times, an weekly newspaper published in Moscow. The paper is critical of Vladimir Putin; indeed, it was targeted twice in 2015 by Russian hackers and has been attacked repeatedly by pundits. A Russian citizen and an outspoken critic of Putin, Fishman has covered Russian politics for more than 15 years. For the past year, he has monitored the increasingly bizarre relationship between Putin and Trump, with a particular focus on Putin\u2019s strategic aims.",
        "The narrative as we head into the 2017 Oscars and the battle for the year\u2019s Best Picture trophy is that La La Land\u2019s win is inevitable. Even among its detractors and amid some recent backlash (which mostly centers on accusations of the film\u2019s racism cultural appropriation, but which you could definitely argue is a result of its popularity) there\u2019s a concession that it will beat out fellow frontrunners Moonlight and Manchester by the Sea, plus the other six nominees on the list. La La Land\u2019s frontrunner status is akin to being the team in a sporting event.",
        "Bill Maher, the controversial liberal host of Real Time, says he\u2019s to thank for the fall of former Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos. Maher, who interviewed Yiannopoulos on his show over the weekend, told the New York Times on Tuesday night: About a week ago, I went on Van Jones\u2019s show, and somebody asked me about the booking. I hadn\u2019t really gotten into the details of Milo yet. He was just getting on my radar. I said, specifically, sunlight is the best disinfectant.",
        "CPAC, the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, starts Wednesday at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in the suburbs of Washington, DC. The conference has already made headlines for the invitation and subsequent disinvitation of troll and provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos when it was revealed that he\u2019s added the occasional remark to his usual arsenal of misogyny, racism, and transphobia. But while speaker invitation controversies are part and parcel of any good CPAC, the annual conference is much more than the Milo story.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s Inauguration Day swag store is now open for business. In exchange for a contribution to the president\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign, donors can buy Trump commemorative plates ($55) \u201cgolf \u201d bearing the president\u2019s name and inaugural seal ($35) and \u201cAmerican Creed\u201d ($25). \u201cAmericanism, not globalism, will be our credo,\u201d the shirts read. There\u2019s nothing particularly unusual about presidential candidates selling apparel or merchandise to raise money for their campaigns. What is unusual is starting that campaign before your first month in office is up. Trump\u2019s team is fundraising earlier than any other president in modern American history.",
        "President Trump started his February 16 press conference sounding almost subdued. Standing in front of a backdrop of flags and gold curtains in the White House East Room, he announced his new nominee for labor secretary \u2014 Alex Acosta \u2014 to a quiet and respectful audience. But the calm did not hold. As the event went on, the president became combative, visibly angry with the press. \u201cI\u2019m not ranting and raving,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just telling you, you\u2019re dishonest people. \u201d He was particularly incensed over leaks.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Justice has reopened its doors to business from private prisons. On Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions made it public that he rescinded a guidance that tasked the Justice Department with ending its use of privately operated prisons. Last year\u2019s memo by Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates came after the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) found serious problems and more frequent reports of violence at privately run, facilities compared with federal public prisons.",
        "Former House Speaker John Boehner says he started \u201claughing\u201d when he heard the GOP\u2019s plan to swiftly repeal and replace Obamacare. \u201cRepublicans never ever agree on health care,\u201d he said in comments first reported by Politico. And here\u2019s the kicker. \u201cMost of the framework of the Affordable Care Act \u2026 that\u2019s going to be there,\u201d Boehner said. He went on to say that he thought everyone covered by Medicaid now would keep their Medicaid coverage. Ouch. I\u2019ve seen some react with fury to these comments. Didn\u2019t Boehner hold repeal vote after repeal vote?"
