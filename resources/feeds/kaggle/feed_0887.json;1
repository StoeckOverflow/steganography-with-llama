        "As members of Congress take a break from the hard work of legislating to go home to their districts, many Republicans are facing a tough reception at town hall meetings. Liberals, echoing tactics used by Tea Party activists in the summer of 2009, are flooding these forums with unusually large and hostile crowds demanding answers about what the GOP plans to do for the millions of Americans who depend on the Affordable Care Act for health care.",
        "On Tuesday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that will begin the long, hard process of dismantling President Barack Obama\u2019s climate policies \u2014 including, most prominently, the Clean Power Plan. Trump\u2019s executive order won\u2019t, by itself, repeal the Clean Power Plan, which is a major Environmental Protection Agency regulation that aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants 32 percent below 2005 levels. Instead, Trump will ask his new EPA head, Scott Pruitt, to replace Obama\u2019s rule with \u2026 something else.",
        "In the first weeks of 2017, at least 90 bomb threats have been called in to Jewish community centers across the country, sending preschool kids scurrying to safety, again and again beyond the walls of their daytime homes. In late February, a historic Jewish cemetery outside Philadelphia was vandalized, with nearly 100 tombstones overturned. On February 27th alone, seven Jewish community community centers, along with the San Francisco office of the League (ADL) were evacuated after receiving threats.",
        "Over the past few years, eight states and Washington, DC, have legalized marijuana for recreational purposes, and 20 more have legalized it for medical uses. President Barack Obama\u2019s administration took a approach to these states, deciding not to enforce federal laws that prohibit marijuana use as long as states followed some rules. But what will President Donald Trump\u2019s administration do? On Thursday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer gave the clearest answer yet to this question: There\u2019s two distinct issues here: medical marijuana and recreational marijuana.",
        "Ten days after Kim Jong Nam, the of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, was killed at a Malaysian airport, we still don\u2019t know who murdered him \u2014 or why. Malaysian investigators are pointing fingers at North Korea and at Kim Jong Un himself for organizing the murder, which was reportedly carried out by two women recruited as assassins who attacked Kim Jong Nam with a poison.",
        "When White House counselor Kellyanne Conway tried to defend President Trump\u2019s record on women Thursday, she picked a strange way to do it: claiming that attendees of the Women\u2019s March, and many other women who oppose Trump, \u201cjust have a problem with women in power.",
        "Julienne Edwards was 26, five days away from taking the California bar exam and 14 months away from her wedding, when she felt a twinge in her stomach. The throbbing grew sharper, like a knife puncturing her gut, so Edwards went to the hospital to get help. It was the beginning of a nightmare. Edwards, who was otherwise healthy, was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer. Within four days of her hospital visit, she was on an operating table for emergency surgery to remove a tumor blocking her lower intestines and part of her colon.",
        "The Trump administration has made it clear that it won\u2019t protect transgender students from discrimination: On Wednesday, it sent out a letter officially revoking an guidance protecting trans students in federally funded public schools. The decision upholds a promise President Donald Trump made on the campaign trail, but comes as a major blow to LGBTQ groups who over the past few weeks pleaded with the administration to keep the guidance in place.",
        "In 2002, when I first started working on in southern Africa, my friends and colleagues devoted every weekend to attending funerals. At that time, the antiretroviral drugs that were keeping people alive in New York and San Francisco were almost nowhere to be found in Africa, and the disease swiftly ravaged its victims. Fifteen years later, the epidemic has turned a corner in three African countries that are at the epicenter of the crisis.",
        "NATIONAL HARBOR, Maryland \u2014 Sarah Chaulk says she remains \u201cextremely bitter\u201d about how much taxpayer money was spent on President Barack Obama\u2019s travel and family vacations during his time in office. \u201cWhen Obama put his dog on Air Force One and then told us to give more to help poor people, it was a slap in the face to the entire country,\u201d Chaulk, 60, a graphic designer from Columbus, Ohio, said on Wednesday at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) the marquee annual gathering for conservative activists.",
        "For 88 years, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has been handing out gold statuettes to honor the best movies Hollywood has to offer. And since the early 2000s, the (rich, beautiful, talented) winners and losers alike have been going home with thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of free goods. These gift bags are one of the weirdest and most ostentatious traditions to spring up around the awards show \u2014 one company\u2019s 2016 bags contained items worth $232, 000, and even prompted the Academy to sue that company. So what\u2019s the deal with the bags?",
        "Donald Trump very deliberately picked a fight with the media to help fuel his rise to the White House, and now that he\u2019s there \u2014 and his administration is struggling \u2014 he is strategically escalating it. On Friday, the administration canceled press secretary Sean Spicer\u2019s scheduled briefing to the full White House press corps, and replaced it instead with an briefing to which some media outlets were invited \u2014 and others were excluded, including CNN, the New York Times, Politico, and BuzzFeed News. The move was met with howls of protests.",
        "Politico has obtained a leaked draft of a Republican replacement plan for Obamacare. The plan may be somewhat outdated already \u2014 it is two weeks old, per its time stamp, and Republicans have been working hard on their proposal in the meantime \u2014 but it almost certainly reveals an important shift from earlier GOP plans. In broad strokes, the draft bill hews closely to ideas outlined by House Speaker Paul Ryan and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price.",
        "The story of Milo Yiannopoulos\u2019s fall from conservative grace ended when a conservative blog posted video footage of him making comments that seemed to rationalize pedophilia. But it started when a high school student in Canada decided Yiannopoulos was embraced much too closely by mainstream conservatives. The teen was moved to dig up footage on Yiannopoulos when she heard that he\u2019d been invited to speak at the highest profile gathering of conservatives each year in America, the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). She defines herself as \u201cvery socially liberal,\u201d but leans right on economics and foreign policy.",
        "The 89th annual Academy Awards announce their winners this Sunday, February 26, so if you want to catch up on the nominees \u2014 the better to know when to celebrate roll your eyes during the ceremony \u2014 you\u2019ve got a couple days left to do so.

        "The Democratic National Committee will elect a new chair on Saturday, in a vote that has pitted the party\u2019s grassroots base and dozens of Democrats in Congress against veterans of President Barack Obama\u2019s White House and Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign. Rep. Keith Ellison ( ) one of the two leading contenders, enjoys the support of state party chairs, most Democrats in the House, and the Bernie wing of the party. Former Obama Labor Secretary Tom Perez has the strong backing of former administration officials, including Vice President Joe Biden and former Attorney General Eric Holder.",
        "Kim Jong Nam, the of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, died in a Malaysian airport on February 13 after two women rubbed a poison on his face. It\u2019s unclear why Nam was killed, and who was behind the plot. But this story gets more mysterious, more dramatic, and weirder by the day. On Friday, Malaysian authorities reported that the poison that killed Nam was VX, a chemical \u201cweapon of mass destruction\u201d that the United Nations banned in 1993. This is no drugstore poison: VX is one of the most toxic chemical substances ever to be manufactured.",
        "The last week must have been one of the worst in Uber CEO Travis Kalanick\u2019s life. It began with viral allegations of toxic misogyny in the company\u2019s ranks and continued with a public apology and an internal investigation launched from the executive suite. Then came the corporate espionage allegations, and lawsuit, that could kneecap a key piece of Uber\u2019s future plans. Taken together, the events underscore just how tenuous of a position Uber occupies on the tech landscape, especially compared to other giants such as Facebook or Apple.",
        "If for some reason you haven\u2019t seen Die Hard, it\u2019s a movie about a gang of thieves who hold an office building hostage to perpetrate a robbery. Except part of the plan to get away with it involves pretending to be ideologically motivated terrorists. At one point the ringleader, Hans Gruber, is speaking on the phone with an FBI negotiator and rattles off a list of political prisoners being held around the world whose release he is demanding. It\u2019s just a stalling tactic, designed to get the authorities spinning their wheels for no reason.",
        "If you want to see where the movie business is going, just look at the top 10 grossing films internationally for 2017 so far. The casual American movie fan has heard of just over half of these films. Resident Evil, LEGO Batman, Split, The Great Wall, Fifty Shades Darker, and xXx have all received major American releases, and two of those films \u2014 Split and LEGO Batman \u2014 have made more than half their box office in North America so far.",
        "President Donald Trump spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference Friday, delivering a freewheeling speech in a style familiar from his time on the campaign trail. Trump touted his election victory, took a couple of swings at his former opponent Hillary Clinton, and defined the \u201cmess\u201d he inherited from President Barack Obama \u2014 and, of course, went on a winding tangent about his distaste for the media. Here are Trump\u2019s remarks in full. Great to be back at CPAC. It\u2019s a place I have really \u2014 I love this place. I love you people. So thank you very much.",
        "Here\u2019s an odd sign of the times. Snapchat\u2019s Peter Hamby was at National Harbor to watch President Donald Trump\u2019s speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday, and he saw audience members waving tiny Russian flags emblazoned with the name \u201cTRUMP. \u201d Staffers seem to have swiftly realized this was a bad look for a president who is under suspicion of a variety of shady ties with Russia, and confiscated them. At the same time, the speech itself really only deepened the questions around Trump and Russia.",
        "A picture is beginning to emerge of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s first three weeks as America\u2019s top diplomat. It isn\u2019t pretty. On Thursday, a pair of devastating articles in Politico and the Washington Post described how the former Exxon Mobil CEO has been cut out of the loop on major foreign policy shifts, slapped down by the White House on personnel choices, and given virtually no opportunities to make public appearances with President Trump.",
        "Google just filed a lawsuit against Uber that will have huge implications for the future of car technology. Google has been working on cars since 2009, and for a long time the company practically had the field to itself. But in the past couple of years, the market has gotten a lot more crowded. One of the newcomers was Otto, founded by Google veterans in January 2016 to create technology for trucks.",
        "Republican lawmakers around the country are facing angry backlash from their constituents over Obamacare and other issues at packed town halls. But an event for Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton on Wednesday night got especially heated. One voter, her voice raw with emotion, told Cotton that her husband is dying and has Alzheimer\u2019s and other conditions. \u201cAnd you want to stand there with him at home, expect us to be calm, cool, and collected? Well, what kind of insurance do you have?\u201d she said, as the crowd erupted. Voter to @SenTomCotton: My husband is dying.",
        "Republican replacement plans for Obamacare would lead to significant declines in the number of Americans with health insurance coverage, according to an analysis presented Saturday at the National Governors Association and obtained by Vox. The analysis was conducted by the health research firm Avalere Health and the consulting firm McKinsey and Company. The analysis includes graphs on what the Republican plan to overhaul Obamacare\u2019s tax credits, generally making them less generous, would do. They are based on the recent proposal that Republican leadership released about their plan to repeal and replace Obamacare.",
        "The Democratic Party has made its first leadership pick of the Trump era, by electing former Secretary of Labor Tom Perez as DNC chair \u2014 a candidate who, rightly or wrongly, was seen as the leading party establishment choice against the Bernie Keith Ellison. But just after he won, Perez quickly made a gesture of unity, asking DNC members to suspend the rules so that Ellison could be named deputy chair. Ellison then spoke to the Atlanta gathering and urged party unity. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury to walk out of this room divided,\u201d he told his supporters.",
        "President Trump has officially named the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s Kevin Hassett as the chair of his Council of Economic Advisers. The CEA chair serves as the White House\u2019s chief economist, and while Trump has demoted the position from the standing it enjoyed under past presidents, it remains one of the most important economic policy jobs in the federal government. That makes Hassett\u2019s selection important \u2014 and intriguing.",
        "Rep. Darrell Issa, the California Republican who bedeviled the Obama administration with inquiries into Benghazi and the IRS, thinks the alleged ties between President Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia are worth investigating \u2014 and wants a special prosecutor to do it. His remarks on HBO\u2019s Real Time With Bill Maher Friday broke with the party line from the House GOP, which has been reluctant to call for aggressive investigations into Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re going to ask the intelligence committees of the House and Senate to investigate within the special areas they oversee,\u201d Issa said.",
        "Republican governors are undecided on how far they want Congress to go in overhauling Medicaid, internal documents obtained by Vox show. The governors, who gathered in Washington this weekend for the National Governors Association, will be a crucial voice in the debate over repealing and replacing Obamacare. Many participated in the health law\u2019s Medicaid expansion, which has expanded coverage to millions of Americans. The Republican Governors Public Policy Committee has drafted up its policy demands for Congress \u2014 but is still undecided on at least two significant policy questions."
