        "Elizabeth Drew is the author of Washington Journal, one of my favorite books about Watergate. Drew covered Richard Nixon\u2019s collapse as a reporter for the New Yorker, and the book emerges from the journalistic diary she kept amid the chaos. As such, it does something no other Watergate book does: tells the story not as a tidy tale with a clear beginning and inevitable end, but as an experience thick with confusion, rumors, alarm, and .",

        "Donald Trump\u2019s but rarely desire for some kind of major infrastructure legislation has always faced two major hurdles. One is the simple reality that in general, it is hard to get laws passed in the United States. The other is that it\u2019s long been clear that enacting a major infrastructure building law is not a high priority of the Republican Party leadership in Congress.",
        "ATLANTA \u2014 Karl Sandstrom looked at the room across from where the Democratic Party was about to choose its new leader and shook his head in disbelief. The scene was chaotic. Pete Buttigieg had just quit the race, and three of the Indiana mayor\u2019s young volunteers were hugging. Two reporters conducting an interview walked briskly past. Hundreds of campaign posters were scattered across the room \u2014 dozens of Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison\u2019s green signs lay on the floor next to a pile of ads for vice chair candidate Michael Blake. \u201cYou see these signs out here?",
        "At the Oscars, the award for Original Song (and Original Score) is just what it sounds like \u2014 music written specifically for a film, rather than for something else. For instance, Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s 2014 performance of \u201dThe Hanging Tree\u201d from the third Hunger Games movie was ineligible, because its lyrics were written by Suzanne Collins for the Hunger Games book series. The music was original to the movie, but that\u2019s not enough. Original songs must be heard within the movie itself, or as the first song during the closing credits.",
        "For a brief moment, the 2017 Oscars belonged to La La Land, and then, at the last minute, Moonlight ended up winning Best Picture. In short: La La Land was erroneously announced as the Best Picture winner, and after a few abruptly truncated speeches and general confusion, Moonlight, the true recipient, was then announced as the winner. That shocking moment will be the most memorable thing about the 89th Academy Awards. But La La Land didn\u2019t go home . In fact, it was the night\u2019s biggest winner, taking home six awards, including Best Director and Best Actress.",
        "ATLANTA \u2014 One day before the Democratic Party chose its new leader, supporters of Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison found themselves suddenly parrying an attack they thought they\u2019d already defeated: that Ellison had a troubling record of opposing Israel and American Jews. On Friday, a group called the American Jewish Congress told members of the Democratic National Committee that Ellison \u2014 the first Muslim member of Congress \u2014 would \u201dthreaten the relationship\u201d between America and Israel.",
        "Right now, if you\u2019re thinking about the Oscars, it\u2019s probably because you\u2019re filling out a ballot in hopes of winning your friendly local Oscar pool. And if you need informed choices, we\u2019ve got \u2019em. Related The complete ranking of this year\u2019s films This year\u2019s awards are a little less exciting than they\u2019ve been in year\u2019s past, mostly because the La La Land stands to win many of the 13 categories it\u2019s nominated in. (It was nominated twice for Best Original Song.) But there are a few interesting races around the edges of the evening.",
        "The Academy Awards are in what they honor. There are plenty of proposed Oscars \u2014 including best stunt coordination, best ensemble cast (or best casting) and best voiceover performance \u2014 but they seem unlikely to ever materialize. At the very least, it\u2019s safe to say the Oscars will never come close to handing out as many trophies as, say, the Grammys, which reward nominees in more than 80 categories.",
        "Those who don\u2019t learn from the past may be doomed to repeat it, but in the case of Oscars fashion trends, that may actually be a good thing. Canadian blogger Sarah Ganske took to Twitter Saturday to share a fascinating and revealing look back at vintage Oscar fashion through the years. And now for a GIF parade of vintage Oscars glamour. If gowns, caftans, and bouffants aren\u2019t your thing, you may want to mute me for an hour.",
        "What happened at the Oscars is unprecedented. The night\u2019s biggest award \u2014 Best Picture \u2014 was handed to the wrong film, presumed frontrunner La La Land, because presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway were given the wrong envelope. It bore the name of La La Land\u2019s Emma Stone, who had won Best Actress moments before.",
        "In remarks at a press preview of his budget priorities on Monday, President Donald Trump teased the idea that, after working with his team and in consultation with Republican governors, he is nearly ready to unveil his plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. \u201cWe have come up with a solution that\u2019s really, really, I think very good,\u201d he said, before proceeding to say nothing about what that solution looks like. One issue, according to Trump, is that health insurance policy is difficult. \u201cIt\u2019s an unbelievably complex subject, nobody knew that health care could be so complicated.",
        "In the annals of New York Times corrections, this one is a doozy: Correction: February 25, 2017Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Sean Spicer\u2019s upbringing. He was New England bred, having been raised in Rhode Island; he was not \u201cNew England born. \u201d (Mr.",
        "For decades, China has held the status of \u201cthe world\u2019s factory,\u201d harboring the largest supply of inexpensive labor for industrial production across the globe. But as its economy has grown, so have wages \u2014 and now some are so high they\u2019re approaching levels seen in Europe. According to new data from Euromonitor, a market research firm, average manufacturing wages in China rose to $3. 60 an hour last year. That might not sound like much compared to the US, where they\u2019re around $26 per hour.",
        "\u201cIt is simply to conceal something as fundamental as the nature of constitutional \u2014 especially if concealment is motivated by the fear that the citizenry wouldn\u2019t stand for the practice if it knew the truth. If the Court can\u2019t admit what it is doing, then it shouldn\u2019t do it. \u201d \u2014 Paul Brest, 1981 The doctrine of originalism, whereby judges purport to identify and then rely on the original meaning of the United States Constitution to resolve constitutional cases, is more ingrained in our national consciousness today than at any other time in our history.",
        "President Donald Trump\u2019s Office of Management and Budget is set to release a \u201cskinny budget\u201d Thursday morning, outlining spending and tax policies for fiscal year 2018, which starts in October. The budget will reportedly feature a hike in defense spending, paid for by slashing the State Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, foreign aid, and many domestic spending programs. That\u2019s big news \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t mean those changes are necessarily going to happen. The president\u2019s budget is not law, and it is not actually implemented government policy.",
        "The story of the Oscars this year won\u2019t be written in terms of the Best Picture winner \u2014 Moonlight \u2014 or the biggest trophy gatherer, La La Land. It won\u2019t be written in terms of host Jimmy Kimmel or memorable speeches.",
        "I spent Thursday night in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, conducting focus groups with Obamacare enrollees to get a sense of what they think of various Republican ideas to change the ACA. What I found surprised me. I worked with the research firm PerryUndem, which set up two groups. One was exclusively Medicaid enrollees. The other was Trump voters enrolled on Obamacare programs (either Medicaid or the marketplace). In total, we talked to about 14 participants for three hours.",
        "The Trump administration is working on a budget proposal to boost military spending by roughly 10 percent, or $54 billion, in fiscal year 2018 \u2014 while pursuing deep, offsetting cuts to a variety of other federal agencies, particularly the State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency. Right now this proposal is only the first step in a long, complex budget process. The White House will send a broad budget outline to federal agencies on Monday and ask for feedback on which programs to cut. The Trump administration will then finalize a formal budget request to Congress by May.",
        "Democrats have selected former Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear to deliver the party\u2019s response to President Donald Trump\u2019s congressional address on Tuesday. Beshear bolstered his national reputation by implementing Obamacare in an especially conservative area. Under the health law, Kentucky\u2019s uninsured rate has fallen from 20 percent to 7. 5 percent \u2014 the largest drop in the country. \u201cIn the first 18 months, we had, like, 400, 000 to 500, 000 Kentuckians involved in this program, most of them for the first time in their lives getting health care,\u201d Beshear told us in an interview last November.",
        "There was a major upset at the Oscars on Sunday night \u2014 in more ways than one. The favorite to win the night\u2019s big prize, La La Land, held the title of Best Picture for about 45 seconds. Presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway announced that the musical had won, and then, in a shocking turn of events, the producers accepting the award suddenly stopped their acceptance speech and revealed that Moonlight had actually won.",
        "Back on February 18, CBS News\u2019s Major Garrett reported that Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to serve as secretary of the Navy was likely to withdraw from consideration. Any withdrawal by a nominee is somewhat unusual, but it wasn\u2019t a totally shocking story. Trump\u2019s transition was somewhat chaotic due to the \u2019s lack of political experience and the fact that he fired his transition director, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, on the first day of the transition. A lot of traditional vetting was skipped, and so you run into some problems.",
        "The World Health Organization says we need to step up the fight against a dozen bacteria that are growing resistant to all the antibiotics we have to treat them. One of the scariest features of the antibiotic resistance crisis \u2014 which has been accelerated by how we overuse these drugs \u2014 is that pharmaceutical companies aren\u2019t developing new antibiotics quickly enough. They also often place profits ahead public health when choosing which drugs to develop.",
        "Obamacare has permanently shifted America\u2019s health care debate, and Donald Trump\u2019s address to Congress proved it. In the speech, Trump laid out five principles any Obamacare replacement must meet. First, \u201cwe should ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the health care exchanges. \u201d Second, \u201cwe should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the government.",
        "The Donald Trump Show is getting stale, old, and, frankly, a little bit boring. President Trump\u2019s big speech before Congress on Tuesday night was the epitome of the show. There was the gross hypocrisy of \u201cthe time for trivial fights is behind us,\u201d the campy propagandism of creating a Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement office, the prepared remarks in all caps calling to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. Trump knows a thing or two about publicity stunts.",
        "President Donald Trump used his first congressional address to deliver a outline of some policies he supports in an Obamacare plan. Trump only briefly explained each, but what he described are in line with what we know House Speaker Paul Ryan and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price support. Related President Trump\u2019s first big speech to Congress, annotated by Vox staff Hill Republicans badly need to get on the same page to craft and pass a bill.",
        "Most Americans thought little of President Harry Truman when he ascended to the White House in April 1945. Six months later, they thought even less, as the nation\u2019s economy slowed at the end of World War II and the nation woke up to the dangers of the Cold War.",
        "In The Art of the Deal, Donald Trump writes, \u201cYou can\u2019t con people, at least not for long. You can create excitement, you can do wonderful promotion and get all kinds of press, and you can throw in a little hyperbole. But if you don\u2019t deliver the goods, people will catch on. \u201d Trump is having trouble delivering the goods. At this point in his presidency, Barack Obama had far more nominees both named and confirmed, and he had passed the stimulus bill, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, and a massive expansion of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.",
        "A new video released by Bloomberg isn\u2019t going to help with Uber\u2019s existing public image problem. The video was taken by Fawzi Kamel, a longtime driver in Uber\u2019s original, Uber Black service, in early February. It shows the company\u2019s CEO, Travis Kalanick, taking an Uber ride with two female companions. At the end of the ride, Kalanick and the driver get into an argument about Uber\u2019s falling fares. Kalanick says he didn\u2019t have any choice about the fare cuts. \u201cWe didn\u2019t go because we wanted to.",
        "At first glance, it\u2019s hard to see why the Clean Water Rule (also known as the \u201cWaters of the US rule\u201d) inspires such fury. It\u2019s a technical regulation from the Environmental Protection Agency meant to clarify which streams and wetlands fall under federal clean water protections \u2014 a question that had been causing legal confusion for years. But when the rule was published in June 2015, it triggered fierce blowback from farm and industry groups across the country."
