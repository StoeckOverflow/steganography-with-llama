        "President Donald Trump will cap off the first 40 days of his presidency by addressing a joint session of Congress tonight at 9:10 pm Eastern in the Capitol, in his first major speech since his inauguration. Update: Trump\u2019s address to Congress (full annotated transcript) The speech will look a whole lot like a State of the Union address, since the president will deliver it to an audience that includes the vice president, members of the Senate, the House, the Cabinet, and probably the Supreme Court.",
        "Anyone living in the eastern United States has probably noticed how unusually warm it\u2019s been this February. And it\u2019s not just your imagination. There\u2019s even a good way to visualize this. The US Geological Survey has a neat set of maps, updated daily, showing how early spring has arrived in each state this year \u2014 an index based on plant events, like leaves appearing on trees and flowers blooming. In a swath of the country from San Antonio to New York City, spring arrived two to three weeks earlier than usual.",
        "Donald Trump has been president for 39 days. And as Americans prepare themselves to listen to his first address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, it seems appropriate to compare what he promised to do in his first 100 days in office with what has been achieved in close to half that time. The answer, broadly speaking, is that while Trump has certainly initiated some consequential policy changes, he hasn\u2019t come remotely close to accomplishing even a third of his agenda.",
        "Over the past several years, the US Department of Justice played a key role in exposing abuses from local police departments, exposing everything from unjustified shootings to a broader pattern of racism in a police force. But on Tuesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions confirmed that all of that work will come to an end \u2014 saying that the Justice Department will \u201cpull back\u201d on civil rights lawsuits and investigations against police.",
        "Education policy is not a major point of emphasis for Donald Trump personally, but his choice for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, turned out to be perhaps his most controversial nominee. That inaugurates an era in which the normally sleepy Department of Education is going to come under heavy scrutiny, and DeVos as a political neophyte with relatively extreme views and not a ton of White House interest in her issue area just stepped in it again.",
        "Bomb threats against Jewish community centers across the country. The desecration of headstones at a Jewish cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri. For Christian Picciolini, these recent incidents are not necessarily surprising. He\u2019s at the forefront of warning Americans against the growing threat from white nationalists. What makes Picciolini\u2019s insight into these individuals so compelling is that he used to be one. When he was only 14, Picciolini was recruited by Clark Martell, a prominent skinhead leader. By age 18, Picciolini was leading America\u2019s first skinhead gang and helping to recruit and organize cells across the country.",
        "The 2017 Oscars celebrated two men famously accused of hurting women. One of them was a superstar when the accusations against him went public eight years ago. Since then he\u2019d been on a fame hiatus, but now he\u2019s making a comeback. The film he directed was nominated for six Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director, and he grinned through the handful of mild jokes that were made at his expense during the ceremony. The other man hadn\u2019t been all that famous when the accusations against him went public, so he\u2019d never been on any sort of hiatus.",
        "The prolonged standing ovation that President Donald Trump led on Tuesday for the widow of a fallen US commando was an effective bit of political theater. It also masked the lingering controversy over the botched raid in Yemen that took the life of Navy SEAL William \u201cRyan\u201d Owens, which has injected a grieving family into a raging political debate about whether the White House erred in signing off on the mission.",
        "Lent is a mystery to a lot of people. Many folks are generally aware that it\u2019s a religious observance that happens every spring and somehow involves people getting ashes smeared on their forehead giving up chocolate or booze or Facebook until Easter. But like most practices rooted in Christianity, the way people observe Lent, or whether they observe it at all, varies wildly depending on their heritage, specific religious tradition, and preferences. Still, there are some rules and guidelines that mark the observance of Lent for Christians who observe the season.",
        "Attorney General Jeff Sessions, under oath at his confirmation hearing, told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he didn\u2019t communicate with Russians during the 2016 campaign. But a new report by Adam Entous, Ellen Nakashima, and Greg Miller for the Washington Post found that Sessions did speak with the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak. Justice Department officials told the Post that Sessions, in fact, spoke twice with Kislyak, including, the Post reported, \u201cat the height of what U. S. intelligence officials say was a Russian cyber campaign to upend the U. S. presidential race.",
        "If you\u2019re a young progressive, a racial justice activist, or someone who\u2019s developed an affinity for the verb \u201cresist\u201d in the past several months, you probably watched the wrong Democratic response to President Trump\u2019s joint session of Congress. Unless you speak Spanish, that is. The response, delivered by former Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear in a diner that looked like a sitcom set, wasn\u2019t for you. Instead, you should have listened to the response, delivered by DREAMer and activist Astrid Silva (sporting sleek purple hair) on Telemundo and Univision.",
        "A Republican legislator told multiple news outlets that he and other members of Congress will gather in a private room on Capitol Hill Thursday to review a secret draft of the party\u2019s Obamacare replacement plan. Via Bloomberg News: The document is being treated a bit like a surveillance intercept. It is expected to be available to members and staffers on the House and Energy Commerce panel starting Thursday, but only in a dedicated reading room, one Republican lawmaker and a committee aide said. Nobody will be given copies to take with them.",
        "If President Donald Trump really wants to stop \u201cthe cycle of violence\u201d in America, there is a series of statistics in criminal justice that should really, really worry him. The figures, from a new Pew Research Center report: Fewer than half of violent crimes and about a third of property crimes in the US are reported to the police each year. Meanwhile, less than half of violent crimes and less than of property crimes that are reported are actually cleared by police and referred to prosecution.",
        "There was a major twist ending and a major snafu at the very end of the 2017 Academy Awards for the category of Best Picture. The wrong winner was declared. If you look back on the footage and analyze it, you could read on presenter Warren Beatty\u2019s face that something was not right just before the Best Picture winner was announced. Let\u2019s quickly review the timeline of what happened: Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway come out to present Best Picture, but are wrongly given the envelope for Best Actress instead.",
        "Donald Trump, in his speech to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night, did something that he rarely ever does: He spoke in code. Trump called for the US to change its immigration system to be \u201c \u201d \u2014 one of those terms that is generally understood, in Washington, to refer to a specific policy. It\u2019s political code for changing the composition of people settling in America to favor educated, highly skilled immigrants and reduce immigration, which allows US citizens and permanent residents to bring certain family members to settle permanently in the US.",
        "President Donald Trump\u2019s Tuesday night address to Congress was an unusually important occasion. While it wasn\u2019t technically a State of the Union, it served the same purpose: to outline his priorities and policy agenda for the coming year. For many presidents, the SOTU can feel a bit rote. They reiterate policies they\u2019ve already suggested in press releases or past years, trying in vain to get Congress to pass them anyway. It didn\u2019t make news when George W. Bush called for privatizing Social Security in 2005; he\u2019d been doing that for months.",
        "\u201cI realized that I was traumatized, but I didn\u2019t realize it until later. \u201d It\u2019s easy to forget that powerful people often have to struggle to get where they are. But if we\u2019re lucky, they carry that struggle with them and use their power to make things better for the rest of us. One of the most powerful people in Hollywood right now is television producer and creator Ryan Murphy, whose litany of hit TV shows includes Glee, American Horror Story, and The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story.",
        "Right now, the Trump administration is crafting a budget proposal that envisions steep cuts to a number of federal agencies \u2014 including, reportedly, a 24 percent cut to the Environmental Protection Agency that would eliminate of its 15, 000 jobs. There aren\u2019t yet any final decisions on exactly which environmental and energy programs will be targeted for elimination; the White House is still discussing with the relevant agencies. But one place to look for clues is this budget \u201cblueprint\u201d put out by the Heritage Foundation, a major conservative think tank.",
        "Donald Trump would like a lot of things to happen. Donald Trump would like peace in the Middle East. Donald Trump would like Mexico to pay for the wall. Donald Trump would like the press to be nicer to him. So when Donald Trump says, as he did to Congress Tuesday night, \u201cI believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible. . .. I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades,\u201d it shouldn\u2019t necessarily be taken as a promise to labor on a comprehensive reform bill.",
        "Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin (WV) Joe Donnelly (IN) and Heidi Heitkamp (ND) stood and applauded multiple times during President Trump\u2019s speech to Congress Tuesday night, breaking with the bulk of the Democratic Party. The majority of congressional Democrats were visibly critical of Trump\u2019s address. Others laughed, groaned, or even skipped the speech altogether. But Manchin, Donnelly, and Heitkamp are all moderate Democrats facing reelection campaigns in 2018. And their applause \u2014 singled out by the Washington Post\u2019s Chris Cillizza \u2014 is the latest in their distance from the Democratic caucus\u2019s opposition to Trump.",
        "The universe needs saving again, and there\u2019s no one more suited to the job than the ragtag group of misfits known as Marvel\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy. A new trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 debuted on Tuesday night, and by the looks of it, the Guardians have their work cut out for them. The movie\u2019s first trailer, released back in October, gave us a look at Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) and subsequent teasers have offered a glimpse of some of the new characters Guardians vol. 2 will introduce.",
        "A Republican bill to replace Obamacare is reportedly hidden somewhere on Capitol Hill \u2014 and on Thursday morning, legislators and reporters ended up on a bipartisan wild goose chase to find it. Republicans have been hard at work drafting a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. House Speaker Paul Ryan has repeatedly promised it is coming quite soon. Yesterday, multiple news outlets reported that some Republican legislators would have a first chance to look at the bill Thursday. The briefings would be secretive. Members wouldn\u2019t actually receive copies of the legislation.",
        "Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday announced that he would recuse himself \u201cfrom any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns\u201d for president in 2016. Things came to a head after a Washington Post report revealed that Sessions had met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the campaign season \u2014 and subsequently denied meeting with Russians during Senate hearings for his attorney general nomination months later. Outside of his recusal, Sessions has maintained that he did not lie to Congress. The White House has brushed off the matter altogether.",
        "Now that Rick Perry has been confirmed as Donald Trump\u2019s energy secretary, we\u2019re about to find out what he really believes \u2014 and what he\u2019s willing to fight for. Back when he was governor of Texas and running for president in 2011, Perry famously vowed to abolish the Department of Energy (DOE) \u2014 an agency with a $32 billion budget that oversees the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons arsenal and also funds energy research on everything from solar panels to carbon capture. He\u2019s since apologized for that.",
        "President Donald Trump\u2019s Russia scandals are deeply intertwined. As Vox\u2019s Zack Beauchamp writes, there are three separate scandals that together call into question the nature of Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia: the resignation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn; the hacking of the DNC; and the as yet mostly unproven dossier. Now it seems there could be a fourth: The Washington Post reported Wednesday night that Attorney General Jeff Sessions met with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the US twice, even though he has stated twice that he did not.",
        "A strain of deadly bird flu that has a high risk of becoming a pandemic is surging in China, and experts are warning that the US isn\u2019t making the necessary preparations. According to the latest assessment from the World Health Organization, China has had 555 human cases of the H7N9 bird flu virus since last October \u2014 the most of any flu season since the virus was first reported in humans in 2013.",
        "In a Thursday afternoon press conference, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that he would recuse himself \u201cfrom any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns\u201d for president in 2016. Investigations related to the 2016 campaign would be handled by his acting deputy, Dana Boente, according to a Justice Department press release. This list would seemingly include reported investigations into Russian hacking of Democrats\u2019 emails, and into contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials.",
        "During his confirmation hearing, Attorney General Jeff Sessions testified, under oath, that \u201cI did not have communications with the Russians. \u201d We now know, thanks to the Washington Post, that this is false: Sessions met with the Russian ambassador to the US twice in the past year, when he was serving as both a Trump adviser and a US senator. The questions: Did Sessions break the law? And, if so, could he lose his job \u2014 or even be charged with perjury like someone who lied in court?",
        "Barack and Michelle Obama each just sold a book in a joint deal that appears to be bigger than any previous presidential book deal in history. Reportedly, they are making $65 million, which is an unprecedented amount of money for a presidential memoir. It\u2019s a move that signals the publishing industry\u2019s faith in the enduring value of a book from the Obamas \u2014 and the belief that if Barack Obama\u2019s memoir is good enough, it might become a genuine American classic. The Obamas are reportedly earning more than $65 million in this deal.",
        "Anyone with a news app on their phone probably received a notification this morning about Republican leaders and other representatives calling for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from any investigations looking into ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. Since then, Sessions announced that he would indeed recuse himself. If you\u2019re like me, you may have needed some clarification on what \u201crecuse\u201d actually means and quickly looked it up. The dictionary company is now saying you\u2019re not alone \u2014 \u201crecuse\u201d was the most searched word on its site this morning."
