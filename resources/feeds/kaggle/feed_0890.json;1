        "\u201cSuperficial\u201d is how Anna Lembke describes the common understanding of the opioid painkiller and heroin epidemic. Lembke, a Stanford psychiatrist focused on addiction care, agrees that the commonly cited causes of the epidemic \u2014 doctors hoping to treat previously untreated pain conditions, pain patients demanding better treatments, and big pharma pushing opioids on the market \u2014 contributed to the vast overprescription of opioids. That let the pills flow not just to patients\u2019 hands but to their family, their friends, and the black market.",
        "April 26, dubbed #AlienDay by Fox, sees a of both the oldest and the most recent installments in the Alien franchise: Alien and Prometheus. That these films are so different in tone speak to how many things the franchise has become since Alien\u2019s release nearly 40 years ago: an action series, an epic space opera, a deep study in dystopian science fiction, and a staunchly feminist narrative. But what it hasn\u2019t really been, at least not since Ridley Scott\u2019s 1979 classic original film, is horror.",
        "Why do people pretend to know things? Why does confidence so often scale with ignorance? Steven Sloman, a professor of cognitive science at Brown University, has some compelling answers to these questions. \u201cWe\u2019re biased to preserve our sense of rightness,\u201d he told me, \u201cand we have to be. \u201d The author of The Knowledge Illusion: Why We Never Think Alone, Sloman\u2019s research focuses on judgment, and reasoning. He\u2019s especially interested in what\u2019s called \u201cthe illusion of explanatory depth. \u201d This is how cognitive scientists refer to our tendency to overestimate our understanding of how the world works.",
        "Hollywood feeds itself on a steady stream of gossip, and there\u2019s rarely anything juicier than the shockwaves that emanate from a true celebrity rivalry. The upcoming FX series Feud \u2014 which premieres Sunday, March 5 \u2014 explores this in decadent fashion through the lens of the deep freeze between stars Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, whose ongoing clash has become just as legendary as each actress in her own right.",
        "A fierce policy battle is quickly developing around a crucial potential element of GOP replacement plans: tax credits to make individual coverage more affordable. Republican leadership currently faces flak from both liberals and conservatives over this proposal. On one side, a slew of new think tank reports argue that the proposed tax credits are significantly less generous than those under Obamacare, and could leave enrollees unable to afford coverage. On the other, conservative legislators argue the exact opposite: that the tax credits are much too generous and amount to just another entitlement program.",
        "Fewer than 24 hours after President Donald Trump condemned a recent wave of attacks and spoke of allying with Muslim nations, a top White House aide returned to the administration\u2019s unfounded claims that some of the incidents may have been faked and declined to explicitly say whether the president believes Islam is a religion.",
        "President Donald Trump has promised the only immigrants being deported now that he\u2019s in office are \u201cbad hombres\u201d: convicted criminals, threats to American safety and the national interest. News reports from across the country are making clear that\u2019s not true. One day, it\u2019s Daniela Vargas in Jackson, Mississippi, who once was protected from deportation by President Barack Obama\u2019s deferred action program and now could be deported without trial. The next, it\u2019s Romulo the father of four children, pulled over and arrested while driving his youngest daughters to school \u2014 while his daughter taped the whole thing on her phone.",
        "Jeff Sessions, already one of the most controversial and most influential members of Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet, now finds himself enmeshed in a major scandal. He twice stated \u2014 once under oath at his confirmation hearing, another time in answer to a written question from the Judiciary Committee\u2019s ranking member \u2014 that he never discussed the 2016 campaign with officials from the Russian government.",
        "There\u2019s an easy way to cut taxes in Washington, and there is a ludicrously hard way. The easy way is just to cut tax rates. The hard way is to cut rates while also limiting some deductions; the ludicrously hard way is to do all that while also taxing something that was not taxed before, to help offset the cuts. That sort of effort is more commonly known as \u201ccomprehensive tax reform,\u201d and Washington hasn\u2019t really pulled it off for 30 years. Which is why it is notable \u2014 and, to many conservatives, confounding \u2014 that Rep.",
        "March 8 is International Women\u2019s Day, which is usually celebrated in the US with a awareness campaign about the importance of women\u2019s rights. But this year, grassroots activists around the world are planning something more radical \u2014 a women\u2019s general strike, both to oppose President Donald Trump and to make a big push for women\u2019s equality. The age of Trump is the perfect time for a women\u2019s strike, a group of feminist activists and scholars argued in a February Guardian .",
        "One of the biggest video game franchises in the world has a new entry. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild finally came out on Friday for both the Wii U and Nintendo Switch, the company\u2019s newest console. This is big. Video games are now a $ industry, growing massively over the past few years with the mainstream rise of games like World of Warcraft and Call of Duty. But it\u2019s hard to imagine the gaming industry existing as it does today without Zelda, which has literally revolutionized gaming multiple times over several generations of games.",
        "For years, Uber\u2019s app has had a secret feature designed to thwart local government efforts to stop drivers from driving without a taxi license, according to the New York Times. The feature, known as \u201cGreyballing,\u201d blocks suspected city officials from calling drivers. When blacklisted officials logged in to Uber, they would be shown a fake map populated with cars that didn\u2019t actually exist. If officials hailed these imaginary cars, the ride would mysteriously get canceled before they got picked up. The Greyball program was part of a game Uber has played with officials in various cities for years.",
        "President Trump\u2019s advisers are reportedly having a big internal debate over whether the US should pull out of the Paris climate deal \u2014 the key international treaty to address global warming. During the campaign, Trump promised to \u201ccancel\u201d the deal, and senior adviser Stephen Bannon wants him to follow through immediately, reports Coral Davenport of the New York Times. On the other side, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Ivanka Trump are urging Trump to keep the US in the treaty, fearing that an abrupt withdrawal would have \u201cbroad and damaging diplomatic ramifications.",
        "Back when he was governor of Indiana, Vice President Mike Pence used a private email account to conduct official government business, per an investigation from the Indianapolis Star. This is, as any sane person would admit, not the biggest deal in the world. And in a sane universe, it would be a relatively small story. But in the actual universe, the story of the 2016 presidential election campaign \u2014 by far \u2014 was a over Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email account to conduct official State Department business.",
        "A set of screengrabs making the rounds on Twitter is an amazing encapsulation of the Fox News approach to political email scandals. The first image depicts one of the many scenes from Fox\u2019s coverage of the Hillary Clinton email scandal last year. Here it is: The second shows Fox & Friends Friday morning, following Thursday night\u2019s revelations from the Indianapolis Star that Mike Pence used a personal email address while governor of Indiana \u2014 and was hacked. Here it is: Now, the 180 treatment of Democrats on Fox News versus Republicans is not surprising.",
        "President Donald Trump has responded to growing concerns about his administration\u2019s ties to Russia \u2014 by trolling Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in a series of tweets. On Friday, Trump first tweeted out this picture of the Democratic senator from New York sharing donuts and coffee with Russian President Vladimir Putin: We should start an immediate investigation into @SenSchumer and his ties to Russia and Putin. A total hypocrite! pic. twitter. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2017 The picture is apparently from a gas station opening in Manhattan in 2003.",
        "Federal officials have begun making arrests in connection to the numerous bomb threats called into Jewish community centers. On Friday, New York City Police unsealed a complaint charging Juan Thompson, a former Intercept writer from Missouri, for cyberstalking and calling up to eight bomb threats into JCCs. Notably, officials say Thompson\u2019s arrest does not close the investigations into recent bomb threats made to JCCs. Rather, Thompson is tied to threats from late January and early February, and reportedly made them to \u201csettle a personal score.",
        "Snap, the company behind the very popular Snapchat app, released its first quarterly financial results as a public company, and the results weren\u2019t pretty. Revenue was well below Wall Street\u2019s expectations, and losses were larger than expected. Markets responded by slashing 20 percent off the company\u2019s share price. Yet there\u2019s still some reason to be bullish about Snap\u2019s prospects. When Snap went public earlier this year, there was a lot of discussion about whether it\u2019s the next Facebook (e. g. poised for massive growth and profitability) or the next Twitter (slowing growth and continued losses).",
        "Tim Ferriss is the author of The Workweek, as well as the new book Tools of Titans. He\u2019s also the host of The Tim Ferriss Show, which is one of my favorite podcasts. Tim is a relentless optimizer, and on his program he interviews fascinating people to discover how they work, think, and get things done. It\u2019s a show about the secrets of high performers. Here, I ask Tim about basically the reverse of that. How does he think about the parts of his life that, though crucial, are harder to optimize and systematize?",
        "The American Health Care Act \u2014 Republicans\u2019 proposal to repeal and replace Obamacare \u2014 is headed for a vote in the House of Representatives on Thursday. Despite years of Republican promises to repeal and replace Obamacare, though, the bill\u2019s ability to pass is in serious doubt. The bill, according to an estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, would cause 24 million more people to be uninsured by 2026. It will offer a modest benefit to younger, wealthier people at the expense of older and poorer ones.",
        "The Trump administration continued to leak like a sieve over the weekend, with White House reporters unearthing enlightening new information about the president\u2019s reaction to recent events. The short version? President Trump is not happy. He\u2019s not happy that Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from investigations, he\u2019s not happy that people aren\u2019t taking his accusations that President Obama tapped his phones more seriously, and he may not be happy with his chief of staff, Reince Priebus.",
        "The first version of President Donald Trump\u2019s refugee and visa ban \u2014 the one he signed on January 27, in place for only a week before federal courts put it on hold \u2014 was an ambitious disaster. It attempted, literally overnight, to prevent people who had already bought plane tickets from entering America. It posed a substantial problem for people currently living in the US who might want to travel abroad. And it turned preference for \u201cpersecuted religious minorities\u201d into a cornerstone of US refugee policy.",
        "At least three US public school districts have announced that they are canceling classes on International Women\u2019s Day \u2014 because too many of their teachers will be taking the day off in protest to support women\u2019s rights. The \u201cDay Without a Woman\u201d protest and general strike on March 8 has apparently attracted a lot of interest among teachers in Alexandria City Public Schools in Virginia, Prince George\u2019s County public schools in Maryland, and the Chapel school district in North Carolina.",

But all three of them refused to take any questions from the press. Tillerson, Kelly and Sessions refuse to take questions amazing. \u2014 Glenn Thrush (@GlennThrush) March 6, 2017 President Trump himself, meanwhile, signed the order quietly and .

        "Early Saturday morning, President Donald Trump tweeted that he \u201cjust found out\u201d that former President Barack Obama \u201chad my \u2018wires tapped\u2019 in Trump Tower\u201d just before the election. Trump then claimed his \u201cphones\u201d specifically were tapped by Obama \u201cin October\u201d and added, \u201cThis is . Bad (or sick) guy!\u201d The president cited zero sources and gave zero evidence for these earthshaking claims, and even his top aides were reportedly caught by them. Then, he changed the subject from this allegedly momentous scandal he had just discovered to tweet about Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s low ratings as host of The Apprentice.",
        "Ben Carson says slaves were \u201cimmigrants\u201d who \u201chad a dream that one day their sons, daughters, grandsons, granddaughters, great grandsons, great granddaughters might pursue prosperity and happiness in this land. \u201d Seriously.

        "A lengthy new investigative story published by Adam Davidson in the New Yorker reveals that Donald Trump\u2019s business dealings in Azerbaijan likely violated the Foreign and Corrupt Practices Act, and may have served as a conduit for and other underhanded activities undertaken by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. It\u2019s a very long New story that deserves your time and attention. But one of the main things it shows isn\u2019t anything specific to Azerbaijan or Iran.",

Their home is part of a larger compound centered on her husband\u2019s father and his four wives. She is expecting her third child very soon. Her husband lives in Nairobi, and every week and a half or so he sends back money: about 200 shillings ($2) in lean times, about 500 ($5) when things are going better.

        "If you read articles about the sharing economy \u2014 and there have been hundreds of them over the past decade \u2014 you\u2019ll often see a line that refers to \u201csharing economy companies such as Airbnb, Uber, and Lyft. \u201d The implication is that these are just three examples of a larger trend that\u2019s transforming the American economy. \u201c is going to become the default way people exchange things, whether it is space, stuff, skills, or services,\u201d wrote Rachel Botsman and Roo Rogers in their influential 2010 book What\u2019s Mine Is Yours.",
        "A second Indian man was killed in a series of potentially racially motivated attacks against Indians living in the US on Thursday night. Harnish Patel, who had lived in the US with his family for 14 years, was shot and killed outside of his home late Thursday night in Lancaster, South Carolina, according to the Lancaster County Sheriff\u2019s Office. The sheriff\u2019s office is still investigating potential motives for the attack, and investigators have not ruled out the possibility that the attack was racially motivated, said staff attorney for the sheriff\u2019s office Doug Barfield."
