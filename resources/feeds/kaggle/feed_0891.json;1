        "What exactly are we fighting over when it comes to health reform? Is there really a fundamental philosophical difference between the parties\u2019 positions? Does either party actually have a philosophy of American health care? On the one hand, the difference between the parties seems clear: the GOP plan is basically a tax cut for the rich that takes health care away from the poorest Americans and leaves the states holding the bag.",
        "FBI Director James Comey requested yesterday that the Justice Department publicly refute President Trump\u2019s claims that President Obama had \u201ctapped\u201d phones at Trump Tower in the runup to the November election, according to the New York Times. Trump had suggested that the behavior rose to \u201c \u201d levels of illegality. That official rebuttal has not yet occurred \u2014 although Comey has now effectively produced his own refutation, thanks to leaks to the Times (whose reporting has not been confirmed elsewhere, as of early Sunday evening).",
        "A few years ago, I stood in a small basement classroom just outside of New York City, watching a high schooler named Serena Stevenson answer math questions in rapid succession. An instructor read out numbers \u2014 74, 470 70, 809 98, 402 \u2014 and Stevenson added them in her head. For each question, she closed her eyes, and then the fingers of her right hand began to twitch, a progression of plucks and jerks. The movements were fast and exact. For almost an hour, she used the approach to solve math problems.",
        "China is facing the biggest and deadliest outbreak of H7N9 bird flu in human history. The virus causes pneumonia and death in most of its victims, which is why it tops the list of global flu pandemic threats. According to the latest assessment from the World Health Organization, China\u2019s had 555 human cases of the H7N9 bird flu virus since last October \u2014 the most of any flu season since the virus was first reported in humans in 2013.",
        "It was a scary Monday on the Korean Peninsula, where the following all happened in less than 24 hours: North Korea launched four ballistic missiles toward Japan and boasted they were a dry run for attacking American troops there; the US began the deployment of a controversial missile system in South Korea despite furious pushback from a very unhappy China; and North Korea temporarily banned all Malaysian citizens from leaving the country in a dramatic escalation of a diplomatic spat with one of its few allies in the world.",
        "Have you read Sarah Kliff\u2019s thorough look at the GOP Obamacare replacement? You have? Good. Some thoughts. Little in politics shocks me. The process House Republicans want to use for their health care bill does. After literally years of complaining Obamacare was jammed down the American people\u2019s throats with insufficient information or consideration, the GOP intends to hold committee votes on their bill two days after releasing it, and without a Congressional Budget Office report estimating either coverage or fiscal effects. It\u2019s breathtaking.",
        "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u01e7an went to the mat on Sunday over the decision of three German cities to cancel upcoming Turkish political rallies. \u201cYour practices are not different from the Nazi practices of the past,\u201d Erdo\u01e7an railed, speaking at a political rally in Istanbul. \u201cYou will lecture us about democracy and then you will not let this country\u2019s ministers speak there. \u201d German Chancellor Angela Merkel had a few choice words in response.",
        "Back during the original Affordable Care Act debate of \u201910, Republicans made a big deal out of the fact that the overall text of the legislation was extremely long. What exactly that proved was never entirely clear, but at Tuesday afternoon\u2019s briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer showed that he is all in on this stale, nonsensical talking point by offering the fact that the House GOP\u2019s American Health Care Act is literally shorter than President Obama\u2019s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. \u201cThis is government,\u201d he said, gesturing to the big stack of paper that represents ACA.",
        "After seven years, Republicans have finally released their health care legislation. Now their bill can be compared with the Affordable Care Act based on how it affects enrollees\u2019 pocketbooks \u2014 including both premiums and costs for care. The bill does not measure up well: For all but the youngest individuals, it increases both overall costs and the risk of a financially devastating event. Republicans will argue that by cutting back insurance standards, their bill would lower premiums \u2014 because people can choose to buy less coverage than the ACA currently requires.",
        "On Monday, House Republicans released their Obamacare replacement plan. Vox\u2019s Sarah Kliff has a explainer on the bill, which was developed with the White House and Senate Republicans. One key component is that it gets rid of the individual mandate \u2014 the most unpopular part of Obamacare, because it fines people who don\u2019t have health insurance. Instead, Republicans are okay with you not having health insurance.",
        "Set aside, for a moment, Donald Trump\u2019s wholly unsubstantiated allegation that Obama tapped his phones before the elections. Ignore that it\u2019s been denied, on the record, by the man who just stepped down as the nation\u2019s top spy. And ignore that FBI chief Jim Comey wants to go public with a formal denial that would effectively mean accusing the president he serves of lying. Let\u2019s focus on something much scarier.",
        "You can think of human psychology as a series of overlapping mental programs. One program identifies faces as individuals we recognize. Another is working memory, which allows us to make quick calculations in our heads. These programs were coded by evolution and help us survive every day; they are the sources of our ingenuity and our compassion. They are everything we are. These mental programs \u2014 etched in all of us \u2014 are also the sources of horror and pain.",
        "Apple has announced that it will temporarily suspend buying cobalt in the Democratic Republic of Congo, less than a week after the publication of a Sky News investigation chronicling brutal \u201cslave conditions\u201d and child labor in cobalt mines there. Cobalt is one of the most precious minerals in the world for the tech industry. It\u2019s an indispensable component of the rechargeable batteries that run smartphones and laptops. And a majority of the world\u2019s supply is found in the DRC \u2014 one of the poorest countries in the world.",
        "On paper, it seems pretty reasonable that Amazon Studios asked Gilmore Girls creator Amy to produce a pilot episode of her new show, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, before handing over a order. Pilots are a standard part of the TV development process, and Amazon loves to emphasize how it\u2019s the only network in the business that asks for public feedback on the shows it\u2019s considering before it goes ahead and produces a whole season of TV.",
        "House Republican leaders have, at long last, released the American Health Care Act, their bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. In the days preceding the bill\u2019s release, Speaker Paul Ryan reportedly urged the White House to deliver President Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement, which he believed would greatly help its chances of passing. And the administration has now made clear that yes, they do support the House bill and want it passed through the chamber.",
        "The National Park Service has released hundreds of official images from Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration ceremony in January that prove, once and for all, that the crowds in attendance were far smaller than those that attended Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration in 2009. Here\u2019s a comparison of Trump\u2019s inauguration in 2017 with Obama\u2019s in 2009, based on the newly released photos: The NPS released the photos this week in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request from BuzzFeed News and other media outlets.",
        "The simplest way to understand Logan is that it\u2019s : The movie opens on America\u2019s dusty southern border and eventually moves to the rocky badlands of North Dakota. The movie\u2019s title refers to Wolverine\u2019s given name, and he\u2019s portrayed as less a traditional superhero and more an aging cowboy who spends a sizable chunk of the movie helping a small farm. There are multiple extended references to the classic 1953 Western Shane, and the unhurried pacing and editing owes more to classic Clint Eastwood than contemporary Michael Bay.",
        "After an almost hiatus, Fleet Foxes have released the first new single off their upcoming album, whose June 16 release was announced today. In an email to fans, lead singer Robin Pecknold acknowledge the band\u2019s long absence, saying, \u201cBet you never thought you\u2019d hear from us again; well, here we go,\u201d before sharing details about the new LP from Nonesuch Records. \u201cThird of May \u014cdaigahara,\u201d the new song, will sound instantly familiar.",
        "Donald Trump added his own signature dose of shamelessness to the Republicans\u2019 shameless crusade against Obamacare. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have insurance for everybody,\u201d Trump told the Washington Post after the election. Under Trumpcare, according to Trump, people \u201ccan expect to have great health care. It will be in much simplified form. Much less expensive and much better. \u201d This was bolder and brasher than what more Republicans had said over the years. But it was, fundamentally, similar to promises and insinuations made by Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, and dozens of other Republicans.",
        "Richard Grenell, a conservative communications professional, will reportedly soon be announced as the Trump administration\u2019s ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It\u2019s an important job given the alliance\u2019s mission of standing up to Russia \u2014 and a tough one given President Trump\u2019s harsh criticism of the organization. Which makes it interesting that Grenell, unlike his potential boss, is a strong supporter of maintaining the NATO alliance and using it as a counterweight to Russia\u2019s efforts to expand its influence in Eastern Europe. Grenell, who served as a foreign policy spokesperson in the George W.",
        "Since the 2016 presidential election, more than 1, 400 companies \u2014 and counting \u2014 have yanked their advertising from the website Breitbart News, where President Donald Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, was formerly the . The ad removals are the result of consumer backlash spearheaded by the Sleeping Giants, an anonymous collective of progressive activists who organize their protests on social media. The group has been urging people to blitz corporations with calls about the message the corporations are sending when they advertise on Breitbart, which is known for incendiary content that is frequently unsourced, false, deliberately distorted.",
        "For health insurance to work, it needs to be a bad deal for lots and lots of healthy people. Those people pay for coverage for years without an expensive chronic illness or catastrophic accident. The money they pay covers the millions of dollars of medical costs for the small share of insurance enrollees who aren\u2019t as lucky. When that doesn\u2019t happen, the health insurance market collapses. It\u2019s a catastrophe known as a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d \u2014 and it\u2019s what some experts fear could happen under the Republican plan to replace Obamacare. But not everyone shares that concern.",
        "Four leading organizers of \u201cA Day Without a Woman,\u201d a strike for women\u2019s rights, were arrested Wednesday during an act of civil disobedience in New York City. Linda Sarsour, Tamika Mallory, Carmen Perez, and Bob Bland (who were also the lead organizers of the Women\u2019s March on Washington) were arrested after blocking traffic outside Trump International Hotel in Columbus Circle. The organizers were released Wednesday night. Bland, who recently gave birth, was the last to be released.",
        "Sonny Perdue, President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to serve as agriculture secretary, has not yet been confirmed, and nobody knows why. It\u2019s not that Democrats are obstructing his confirmation \u2014 since changes to the Senate\u2019s filibuster rule, they can\u2019t block a Trump nominee unless they recruit three Republican \u201cno\u201d votes. And in the case of Perdue \u2014 unlike, say, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos \u2014 they aren\u2019t trying to do this.",
        "Donald Trump won the White House after railing against free trade and has already pulled the US out of one massive trade deal. With less public notice, the new president just took what could be an even more step \u2014 formally declaring that Washington would no longer be bound by rulings made by the World Trade Organization. Citing concerns that many Americans do not \u201csee clear benefits from international trade agreements,\u201d the report lays out Trump\u2019s intention to \u201caggressively defend American sovereignty over matters of trade policy.",

        "On International Women\u2019s Day, other nations have more to celebrate when it comes to women in government. In the past two decades, the US has sunk from 52nd in the world for women\u2019s representation to 104th today, according to data compiled by the Union. In the past year alone, the US has dropped nine places \u2014 from 95th to 104th \u2014 among more than 190 countries. US rank in women\u2019s government dropped 9 spots in the past year And that\u2019s a problem.",
        "An Ohio town is trying an extreme strategy with drug overdose survivors: It will charge them with \u201cinducing panic. \u201d Amanda Hoover at the Christian Science Monitor reported that Washington Court House, a small town in central Ohio, rolled out the idea last month as part of a strategy to deal with the opioid painkiller and heroin epidemic. After first responders revive someone with the opioid overdose antidote naloxone, officials will formally charge the person with \u201cinducing panic.",
        "Donna and Earl Eck took a bus from Altoona, Pennsylvania, to Washington, DC, on Tuesday to spend the day rallying against Obamacare. They were whisked to the capital by Americans for Prosperity, a group that has spent tens of millions of dollars opposing the Affordable Care Act. When they headed to DC, the Ecks had simply planned to stomp around the Capitol, meet other Obamacare opponents, and make their voices of ACA dissent heard.",
        "Today\u2019s Google Doodle honors half of the world\u2019s population \u2014 by celebrating International Women\u2019s Day. But what is International Women\u2019s Day? Where did it come from, and why is it necessary? The day actually has fairly radical origins, involving the Socialist Party of America. Over the past few years, however, it has become a global rallying day for women\u2019s issues with a key goal: to finally bring about gender parity around the world. What is International Women\u2019s Day? In short, it\u2019s a day to work toward gender parity."
