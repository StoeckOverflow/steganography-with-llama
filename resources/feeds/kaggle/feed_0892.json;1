        "We\u2019re excited to announce the second Vox Conversations unconference on April 26 and 27 in Washington, DC. As we approach President Trump\u2019s 100th day in office, we want to convene leading minds across both sides of the aisle to take stock of what\u2019s changed, what hasn\u2019t, and where policy is likely to go at both the federal and state levels. Like our first gathering, this will be an unconference: The conversations will emerge organically from participants, and discussions will be chosen in real time.",
        "Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who was fired in February after lying about his contacts with the Russian government, has formally registered with the Justice Department as a \u201cforeign agent\u201d and admitted that he had lobbied on behalf of the Turkish government as recently as November 2016. As the Associated Press reports, Flynn\u2019s lawyer filed paperwork with the Justice Department Tuesday disclosing that the retired Army general had done lobbying work between August and November 2016 that \u201ccould be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.",
        "At 4:30 am Thursday, after a markup, the GOP\u2019s health bill passed out of the Ways and Means Committee untouched. The American Health Care Act passed out of committee exactly 58. 5 hours after it was introduced on Monday evening. The committee voted in the bill\u2019s favor without knowing how much it costs or whom it covers because they voted before the Congressional Budget Office \u2014 or any other credible authority \u2014 had time to assess the bill\u2019s likely impacts. And Republicans preferred it that way.",
        "I still remember carrying a knife into the showers with me, and being told I should never walk around the forward operating base in Iraq alone for fear of sexual assault. I\u2019m a former Marine \u2014 I spent five years on active duty and two more in the reserve component before departing in 2012. I love the Marine Corps. And I was enraged when I read the news that yet another secret online community had been discovered harassing military women.",
        "The rollout of the House GOP\u2019s Obamacare repeal bill has been very rocky indeed. Major industry associations, conservative activist groups, health policy wonks, the AARP, and the entire Democratic coalition have all panned the American Health Care Act. Other than the US Chamber of Commerce and Republican leadership, enthusiastic supporters are few and far between. The history of congressional politics suggests that something opposed by so many powerful actors is unlikely to become law.",
        "Has President Donald Trump, in his first six weeks in office, singlehandedly secured the border \u2014 simply by scaring people out of coming to the US? It sounds absurd. But it\u2019s plausible. In the first two months of 2017, apprehensions of people crossing into the US from Mexico have fallen by more than half. In December, US Border Patrol agents caught 43, 254 people trying to cross into the United States; in February, they caught 18, 762. The Trump administration is already bragging about its victory over the forces of illegality.",
        "The whole idea behind the Affordable Care Act, the bill Republicans in Congress are now moving to replace, was to make sure more Americans who couldn\u2019t afford health insurance gained coverage. And that\u2019s pretty much how it has worked out. Today, many of the 20 million Americans who became insured through the ACA are the working poor. They are also the group that\u2019s going to hurt the most if the Republicans go ahead with their Obamacare repeal and replace plan, the the American Health Care Act.",
        "Health care news is moving fast these days \u2014 really, really fast. Republicans kicked off this year by introducing a plan to replace Obamacare. Conservative groups howled at it, doctors rejected it, analysts said it could kick millions off insurance rolls, and House legislators ultimately gave up on it. That was all in the first three months of 2017. This is why we\u2019ve launched a daily newsletter, VoxCare, where I am the lead editor and writer. My goal is to explain the day\u2019s most important health care news \u2014 from the Hill to the White House to policy land.",
        "Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. has been tapped to be President Donald Trump\u2019s ambassador to Russia. And that is very, very strange. Huntsman isn\u2019t a Russia expert, or anything close. President Barack Obama appointed Huntsman, a Republican, to serve as ambassador to China in his first term because Huntsman speaks Mandarin and had lived in Taiwan. But he doesn\u2019t speak Russian and he\u2019s never spent any time living in Russia. He\u2019s never held a position where he had to deal with Russian officials regularly or really ever had much to say about the relationship at all.",
        "NEW YORK, NY \u2014 A little more than a century ago, the tragic deaths of 145 garment workers \u2014 most of whom were women, many immigrants \u2014 became a rallying cause for America\u2019s burgeoning labor movement. The fire at the now infamous Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, became a symbol for the right to safe workplaces, better work conditions for immigrants, and women\u2019s rights more broadly. And on March 8, only blocks from where that factory once stood, women gathered in Washington Square Park to strike on International Women\u2019s Day for equal rights and access in the workplace.",
        "The American Health Care Act, Republicans\u2019 Obamacare bill introduced Monday night, is quickly making its way through House committees. Despite President Trump\u2019s claim that it\u2019s all \u201ccoming along great,\u201d however, the bill faces much opposition from a slew of major health care lobbying groups, conservative political organizations, media, and Republican lawmakers (not to mention all the liberals who have spoken out against it). Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture! \u2014 Donald J.",
        "In just a few years, scientists will unveil a creature whose every letter of DNA was written by a human being. It will be a yeast cell with a fully designer genome, and biological capabilities seen nowhere else in nature. Recently, a global team of scientists announced a major milestone in their quest to create a fully synthetic yeast genome. As described in the journal Science, the hundreds of scientists have completed work on six of the yeast\u2019s 16 chromosomes (the individual stands of DNA that make up a genome).",
        "It was nearly 3 am in the House Ways and Means Committee hearing room when the talk turned to Viagra. The hearing was a for the Republican bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. It had been going for 16 hours. Democrats were still offering amendments to the bill. Rep. Linda Sanchez ( ) was up, with a proposal to bar registered sex offenders from using their Health Savings Accounts to pay for erectile dysfunction medication. \u201cI feel very strongly about this,\u201d she said \u2014 but not strongly enough, she admitted, to vote for the bill if the amendment succeeded.",
        "The reaction to the House GOP\u2019s health care bill \u2014 the American Health Care Act, or ACHA \u2014 was swift and severe. Liberals hated it. But so did conservative health care wonks. One exception was Hoover Institute fellow Lanhee Chen, who served as Mitt Romney\u2019s policy director. \u201cIt is a good start and big step in the right direction,\u201d he tweeted. So I called him to hear his case for the bill. A transcript of our conversation, lightly edited for length and clarity, follows.",
        "Imagine that, in 20 or 30 years, a company creates the first artificially intelligent humanoid robot. Let\u2019s call her \u201cAva. \u201d She looks like a person, talks like a person, interacts like a person. If you were to meet Ava, you could relate to her even though you know she\u2019s a robot. Ava is a fully conscious, fully being: She communicates; she wants things; she improves herself. She is also, importantly, far more intelligent than her human creators. Her ability to know and to problem solve exceeds the collective efforts of every living human being.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s embrace of the American Health Care Act, authored by Paul Ryan and other House Republicans seemingly in collaboration with members of his administration, represents a massive betrayal of his own clear and repeated promises to the American people. To an extent, sophisticated political journalists always knew Trump was likely to break those promises. And his embrace of conventional, conservative House Republicans such as Mick Mulvaney to run the Office of Management and Budget and Tom Price to run the Department of Health and Human Services was a clear indication that he intended to break them.",
        "The Trump administration has failed to staff key positions in vital federal agencies. It isn\u2019t clear who is responsible for what, and the White House\u2019s relationship with the federal bureaucracy is rocky. All of this screws up the US government in ways that are often hard to notice from the outside. But sometimes that dysfunction goes public in really revealing ways. Thursday\u2019s State Department briefing was one of those examples. Mexico\u2019s foreign minister, Luis Videgaray, was in Washington. The Los Angeles Times\u2019s Tracy Wilkinson asked State spokesperson Mark Toner what the plans were for his visit.",
        "Most of the people who got insurance through Obamacare were the more than 11 million poor people who benefited from the Medicaid expansion that 31 states, plus Washington, DC, adopted. And they have the most to lose under the American Health Care Act, the Republican replacement. The Republican plan rolls back the expansion, taking 4 million to 6 million people off the rolls, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s. But it goes further than that as well.",
        "There is a line worth noting in David Brooks\u2019s column today: \u201cThe Republican plan will fuel cynicism. It\u2019s being pushed through in an elitist, middle of the night rush. It seems purposely designed to fail. \u201d Quietly, the idea that the House bill is designed to fail is percolating around Washington. I\u2019ve heard it from a people now. The law\u2019s construction is shoddy. The outreach has been nonexistent. The hypocritical, process is baffling. Nothing about it makes sense.",
        "At 2 am on Sunday, March 12, we will push our clocks forward one hour to mark the start of daylight saving time. The change will push sunsets later into the evening hours, at the cost of temporarily disrupting the sleep of millions of Americans. There\u2019s a lot of confusion about daylight saving time. The first thing to know: Yes, it begins in the spring, just as the increase in daylight hours starts to become noticeable. Let\u2019s sort it all out. 1) Why do we need to \u201csave\u201d daylight hours in the summer?",
        "Rushing a major piece of legislation that involves a complicated set of interconnected working parts onto the floor of the House of Representatives without a proper score and analysis from the Congressional Budget Office is worse than a crime \u2014 it\u2019s a mistake. Democrats, when writing their own complicated health care law eight years ago, arguably ended up getting too hung up on the details of CBO scoring. Decisions about when to phase in certain provisions, in particular, were at times excessively driven by the scoring window.",
        "The Affordable Care Act, President Obama\u2019s signature health reform, had one big goal: to make health insurance more affordable and accessible to those who had trouble getting coverage. In essence, that meant finding ways to get America\u2019s poor \u2014 the millions who couldn\u2019t pay for private health insurance or were ineligible for Medicaid \u2014 health coverage. The new GOP health reform plan, the American Health Care Act, is filled with provisions \u2014 some subtle, some not \u2014 that\u2019ll undo that work.",
        "The US economy posted strong gains in February \u2014 which President Donald Trump will almost certainly gloat over, and Federal Reserve officials will almost certainly take as further support for an interest rate hike this month. US companies added about 235, 000 workers, higher than the 200, 000 jobs the economy has gained in a typical month during the current economic recovery. February\u2019s report included other good news for workers too. Hourly wages rose by 2. 8 percent from a year earlier.",
        "The White House tried to claim that federal ethics rules shouldn\u2019t apply to its employees. The Office of Government Ethics, responsible for making sure those rules are enforced, says that\u2019s not true. Now Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have written the White House counsel asking for clarification on the matter. \u201cThe President\u2019s staff need to follow ethics rules \u2014 not flout them,\u201d the letter read. \u201cWhen they violate these rules, the President must impose discipline, not invent a legal fiction that these rules do not apply.",
        "My first shock is a TV mounted high on the wall in one of the airport cafes. American policemen are gassing a crowd of protesters. It\u2019s a little after 7 am on January 26, six days since the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States. I have just arrived at Moscow\u2019s Sheremetyevo Airport from New York. The last time I visited Russia, the country of my birth, was in October 2013. The ticker headline on the TV screen reads Unruly political situation in the US after presidential elections.",
        "House Speaker Paul Ryan could point to any number of challenges as his biggest to overhauling Obamacare. His answer: Senate procedure. \u201dPeople are saying I\u2019d love to have this in there, I\u2019d love to have that in there,\u201d Ryan says. But he can\u2019t. Ryan knows his only chance of getting a plan through the Senate is with a simple majority. That leaves him with the \u201dreconciliation process,\u201d which only lets him touch parts of the law that affect the federal budget \u2014 not, say, the entire health care system.",
        "When The WB debuted a comedy about a teen girl vampire slayer in the spring of 1997, no one expected it to make much of an impression \u2014 let alone become a bona fide pop culture force. But since the launch of Buffy the Vampire Slayer 20 years ago, TV has never been quite the same. So when TV critic Emily Nussbaum declared, in 2014, that 1999 had marked a turning point for television, it wasn\u2019t just because 1999 was the year The Sopranos debuted.",
        "Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt recently wrote a letter explaining why he supported the repeal of Obamacare to a constituent, who was concerned about the results of the 2016 election. The only problem: Blunt\u2019s facts were a bit misleading. The investigative news outlet ProPublica Blunt\u2019s letter, after the constituent sent it to the newsroom. ProPublica discovered problems and misleading claims, including a stat that more than 4. 7 million Americans had their health care plans canceled by the end of 2013. The number is more like 2. 6 million. Read more on their findings here.",
        "In the eyes of its most fervent fans, Marvel has assassinated Magneto, arguably the most beloved villain the comic book company has ever created. And they did it with just one cover. This past week, Marvel revealed variant covers to its upcoming crossover event \u201cSecret Empire,\u201d an event in which Steve Rogers\u2019s allegiance to the Hydra criminal organization will be revealed. Magneto appears on one of those covers, suggesting he\u2019s been in clandestine cahoots with Rogers and Hydra.",
        "Pope Francis, the current leader of the Roman Catholic Church, is known for his relative openness toward conversations long considered taboo in the church, such as LGBTQ issues, contraceptives and abortion. Now the pope is questioning the church\u2019s longstanding rule that priests cannot be married. In an interview published Thursday in the German newspaper Die Zeit, Francis suggested that married men could be ordained as priests in rural communities facing shortages of priests, according to the Associated Press. \u201cWe must consider if viri probati is a possibility,\u201d he said in the interview."
