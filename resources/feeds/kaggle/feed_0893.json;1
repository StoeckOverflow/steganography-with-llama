        "Scott Gottlieb, President Trump\u2019s choice for head of the Food and Drug Administration, was confirmed by the Senate on Tuesday in a 57 to 42 vote. The former deputy commissioner of the FDA under George W. Bush will come to the job with strong views about what FDA reform might look like \u2014 unlike many of Trump\u2019s other nominees. He was also the most mainstream of Trump\u2019s rumored FDA choices. Others included Silicon Valley insiders like Jim O\u2019Neill and Balaji Srinivasan, who both have no background in medicine and seemingly little appreciation for how medical regulation works.",
        "Every weekend, we pick a movie you can stream that dovetails with current events. Old, new, blockbuster, arthouse: They\u2019re all fair game. What you can count on is a weekend watch that sheds new light on the week that was. The movie of the week for March 11 through 17 is The Death of Mr. Lazarescu (2006) which is available to rent on Vudu. The big political debates in the US this week have been all about health care \u2014 who should have it? Who should pay for it? What types of care should we pay for?",
        "The value of bitcoins plunged more than 15 percent on Friday afternoon after the Securities and Exchange Commission rejected an application to create the first fund (ETF) for Bitcoin. The proposal would have made it easier for ordinary investors to buy bitcoins, but the SEC is worried that these investors could be cheated in the largely unregulated Bitcoin marketplace. The ruling has been closely watched in the Bitcoin world.",
        "Robert E. Kelly is a respected political science professor and international security analyst. He\u2019s also \u2014 as much of the internet has now learned, thanks to a new viral video \u2014 a dad. On Friday, Kelly\u2019s two kids barged into his sedate home office in Busan, South Korea, while Kelly was being interviewed by the BBC about the impeachment of the South Korean president.",
        "The Congressional Budget Office on Monday released its analysis of the Republican plan to replace Obamacare \u2014 and it contains some very bad news for supporters of the American Health Care Act. CBO projects that the Republican plan would cause 24 million Americans to lose coverage by 2026. This is a much bigger drop in coverage than experts had expected. Republican legislators will now be forced to answer questions about why tens of millions of Americans will lose coverage and how those people will fare under the new system.",
        "In the cafes of New York City and the offices of Chicago, blue America seeks his wisdom like he\u2019s a prophet or a sage. What should we do? they ask. Show us the path. He likes to respond with a joke \u2014 a dad joke. \u201cWell, you could move to Wyoming or North Dakota,\u201d Barack Obama has taken to telling city liberals, according to one of his senior aides. Since leaving the White House, Obama has publicly embraced the traditionally apolitical role of most former American presidents.",
        "The Congressional Budget Office\u2019s analysis of the GOP\u2019s American Health Care Act is one of the most singularly devastating documents I\u2019ve seen in American politics. For a thorough explanation of the findings, read Sarah Kliff\u2019s explainer. But here is the summary: Under the GOP\u2019s bill, the more help you need, the less you get. The AHCA would increase the uninsured population by about 24 million people \u2014 which is more people than live in New York state. But the raw numbers obscure the cruelty of the choices.",
        "On November 20, less than two weeks after Donald Trump\u2019s upset win, Bernie Sanders strode onto a stage at Boston\u2019s Berklee Performance Center to give the audience his thoughts on what had gone so disastrously wrong for the Democratic Party. Sanders had a simple answer. Democrats, he said, needed to field candidates who would unapologetically promise that they would be willing \u201cto stand up with the working class of this country and . .. take on interests.",
        "After the Congressional Budget Office evaluated Republicans\u2019 plan to replace Obamacare in March, concluding that it would take more than $1 trillion away from programs targeting poor and families and deny 24 million people health insurance, I reached out to one of DC\u2019s most experienced advocates for programs for the poor, to see just how bad this was. His verdict was cutting. \u201cNo legislation enacted in recent decades cut programs this much \u2014 or even comes close,\u201d Robert Greenstein, the founder and president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told me. The bill has changed since March.",
        "As a candidate, Donald Trump promised that he wouldn\u2019t cut Medicaid. He\u2019d \u201csave Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security without cuts,\u201d he pledged during his announcement speech. \u201cHave to do it. \u201d The House Republican health care bill doesn\u2019t just break that promise \u2014 it makes a mockery of it. According to the Congressional Budget Office estimate released Monday, the American Health Care Act would slash $880 billion in federal funds from Medicaid in the next 10 years. As a result, 14 million fewer people would have Medicaid coverage in 2026, the agency estimates.",
        "Congress votes on bills, and the president signs them. And yet, to hear some tell it, it\u2019s an entirely different institution that really calls the shots in Washington. \u201cI say all the time that CBO is God around here,\u201d Sen. Chuck Grassley ( ) mused back in 2006. \u201cBecause policy lives and dies by CBO\u2019s word.",
        "The scenes at the protests at Standing Rock over the Dakota Access pipeline in the past year have been extreme, at times terrifying: guards unleashing dogs on peaceful demonstrators, police spraying freezing cold water on the protesters, and journalists arrested while doing their jobs. Yet behind all this drama, it became easy to miss that this battle is intrinsically linked to Supreme Court cases from nearly 200 years ago. But for Native Americans taking a stand for their tribal lands, that\u2019s exactly what the pipeline battle is largely about.",
        "A few seconds of video have reopened old wounds about police brutality in America. Over the weekend, documentary filmmaker Jason Pollock debuted his movie Stranger Fruit at SXSW, and with it previously unreleased surveillance footage of black teenager Michael Brown at a grocery store. The video shows Brown just hours before he was shot and killed by then \u2014 Ferguson, Missouri, police officer Darren Wilson in August 2014. According to the filmmaker, the new video shows Brown walking into a store and exchanging marijuana with the clerk for cigarillos at about 1 am on August 9, 2014.",
        "When President Donald Trump discusses health reform, there are a few questionably accurate talking points he repeatedly returns to. Obamacare, he says, is \u201cimploding. \u201d Republicans\u2019 replacement for it, he promises, will let people \u201cpick the plan they want\u201d and \u201cthe doctor they want.\u201d Costs, he claims, will \u201cgo down, down, down. \u201d But one point he likes to make has the ring of truth to it \u2014 though in a way that might not help his cause.",
        "As tens of thousands of Americans die from drug overdoses each year, House Republicans are preparing a bill that could make the current and next drug crisis worse. The American Health Care Act, which seeks to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare) may not at first seem directly linked to the ongoing opioid painkiller and heroin epidemic, which contributed to a majority of the more than 52, 000 drug overdose deaths in 2015.",
        "A new bill is quietly making its way through Congress that could bring the US a little closer to a future in which employers could discriminate against their employees based on their genes and risk of disease. To understand how we might get to Gattaca, let\u2019s back up. Under Obamacare, employers are allowed to offer employees deep discounts on health insurance premiums if they participate in workplace wellness programs. The programs often involve medical questionnaires and health assessments \u2014 which has meant employers can get access to some of their employees personal health data. Employers embraced the wellness programs.",
        "In April 2015, Dutch politician Geert Wilders traveled to Washington, DC, to give a speech to the Conservative Opportunity Society, a meeting group of conservatives in the House of Representatives. Wilders had been invited by the Society\u2019s chair, Steve King, to talk about the effect Muslim immigration was having on Europe. Wilders did not disappoint. \u201cThere is no moderate Islam. Islam has changed Europe beyond recognition,\u201d Wilders told the Iowa Congress member and the other representatives. \u201cOur duty is clear: In order to solve the problem, we have to stop mass immigration to the West from Islamic countries.",
        "You probably haven\u2019t heard of Mobileye, but in the past couple of years it has become one of the most important players in the emerging car industry. And that means Intel\u2019s $15 billion acquisition of the company, announced Monday, makes Intel one of the most important tech companies in the car industry. Intel powered the PC revolution by providing the computer chips that allowed PCs to become ever more powerful.",
        "In a Monday morning interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway doubled down on President Donald Trump\u2019s baseless claim that Barack Obama wiretapped his phones in October. Asked to explain what evidence Trump had for the allegation, Conway responded: \u201cChris, I\u2019m not Inspector Gadget. I don\u2019t believe people are using the microwave to spy on the Trump campaign. However, I\u2019m not in the job of having evidence. That\u2019s what investigations are for.",
        "For several decades, cat breeders have been working to develop a pet cat with the appearance of a wild feline, such as a leopard or tiger, but the temperament of a domestic tabby. Some breeds, such as the Bengal and Savannah, were developed by breeding domestics with other species to create hybrid cats. Other breeds, like the Toyger, were created from selectively breeding domestic species. In both instances, the process has been complicated and continues to this day.",
        "Since the House GOP\u2019s health reform bill was released last week, it\u2019s drawn the loudest Republican criticism from the Freedom Caucus. This group of Congress members, aligned with a few senators, has threatened to oppose the bill because it fails to roll back enough of Obamacare. That group could, conceivably, kill the bill in either the House or the Senate, if all its members hang together. But another massive threat to the bill comes from a different group of Republicans entirely \u2014 those worried a GOP health law would cause too many people to lose health insurance coverage.",
        "His Twitter page is emblazoned with the phrase \u201cStop Islam. \u201d He\u2019s called some Moroccan immigrants \u201cscum\u201d who make Dutch streets \u201cunsafe. \u201d Meet Geert Wilders, the Dutch politician and known nearly as much for his thick head of peroxide platinum hair as for his Islamophobia. Wilders, who heads the Freedom Party, is often dubbed the Dutch Donald Trump. But this populist is both more ideological and less impulsive than America\u2019s president.",
        "A key Trump friend and ally is urging the president to dump Paul Ryan\u2019s Affordable Health Care Act and embrace something that sounds sort of like a lightweight version of a health care system. Christopher Ruddy, CEO of the conservative Newsmax brand, isn\u2019t normally considered a major thought leader on policy issues, but he is a longtime friend of Trump\u2019s, and counts as one of a relatively small number of conservative players who have closer ties to Trump than to congressional Republican leaders.",
        "Winter Storm Stella battered the East Coast overnight, dropping more than a foot of snow in some parts of the Northeast by this morning, according to the National Weather Service. The storm also blanketed parts of the Midwest and Plains, with an average of 8 inches of snow accumulation near Milwaukee. We created a map using the NWS\u2019s National Snowfall Analysis to visualize the average snow accumulation in the contiguous United States. The map will update throughout the day as the analysis updates. Check out your location here.",
        "Beyond its findings on higher premiums and coverage loss, the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s official score of the American Health Care Act also quietly demolishes the central publicly stated rationale for repealing the Affordable Care Act. The key passage is a somewhat sentence on the second page of the report that says, \u201cIn CBO and JCT\u2019s assessment, however, the nongroup market would probably be stable in most areas under either current law or the legislation. \u201d Since this is a score of a proposed bill, the rest of the discussion naturally focuses on the \u201clegislation\u201d side of the ledger.",
        "There\u2019s no question that the fate of Obamacare is a matter of life and death. The GOP\u2019s senate plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, the Better Care Reconciliation Act, will result in 22 million fewer people with health insurance by 2026 compared to Obamacare, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That\u2019s like taking health coverage away from a country as big as Australia. If the plan passes through the Senate and becomes law, health researcher and writer Atul Gawande told Vox, \u201cThere will be deaths.",
        "In February, the aid group Save the Children sent photographer Nick Ballon to the border with a grim mission: Put a human face on the suffering of the estimated 7. 5 million Syrian children directly impacted by the country\u2019s brutal civil war. The resulting project, published below, includes portraits of six Syrian children \u2014 one for each year of the conflict \u2014 and then visual interpretations of key parts of their stories by animator Alma Haser. Abbas, 7, and his mother, Abira, 30: \u201cWe felt we needed to show the boy\u2019s vulnerability and his mother\u2019s pain in the art.",
        "How do you actually run a White House? What is the president\u2019s job? What is the chief of staff\u2019s role? What happens if you screw up? These are questions I\u2019ve been reflecting on rather a lot lately, for obvious reasons. And so I asked Denis McDonough on the podcast to talk about them. McDonough served as President Barack Obama\u2019s chief of staff from 2013 to 2017 \u2014 a position in which he earned the nickname \u201cObama\u2019s Obama.",
        "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated late Monday that 24 million Americans would lose insurance coverage under the American Health Care Act. The score is terrible news for Republicans and shows way more Americans losing coverage than most experts had expected. To put that in context: 24 million people is close to the entire population of Australia. This is no good, very bad news for congressional Republicans, who will now field endless questions about why so many people would lose coverage under AHCA \u2014 and what they\u2019re actually trying to accomplish with this plan.",
        "Dear Bill, A few weeks ago, you and your wife Melinda released your famous annual letter on global health and development. I\u2019m always a fan. This year you chose to talk about health \u2014 highlighting the good news that, by one measure, 122 million lives have been saved since 1990 through the reduction of rates."
