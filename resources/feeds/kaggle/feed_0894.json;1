        "The Congressional Budget Office on Monday released its analysis of the American Health Care Act, the Republican bill that would replace Obamacare. It\u2019s a devastating report for the Republican plan, and it can be summed up in one chart: But to understand who will become uninsured, first we have to understand whom Obamacare gave insurance to.",
        "This article contains many spoilers about seasons one through four of The Americans. By the time Philip and Elizabeth Jennings\u2019s teenage daughter Paige announces to her parents at the dinner table that she would like to be baptized as a Christian, we know everything Paige doesn\u2019t: that behind their comfortable home in the suburbs outside Washington, DC, her parents are living a secret life as KGB spies; that their sworn loyalty to their motherland \u2014 where they haven\u2019t lived in decades \u2014 and its ideals means their attitude toward organized religion is, at best, uneasily tolerant.",
        "A federal judge on Wednesday stopped President Trump\u2019s second attempt to temporarily ban visa holders from several countries \u2014 and nearly all refugees \u2014 from entering the United States, hours before it was supposed to take effect. The ruling found that the order likely violates a constitutional prohibition against religious discrimination. It was a scathing rebuke for an order that administration officials spent weeks reworking, in hopes of avoiding the judicial blockade that the first attempt sailed into in January. Trump immediately panned it, in a speech in Tennessee.",
        "On January 6, President Barack Obama sat down with us for one of his final interviews before leaving the White House. The subject was the Affordable Care Act \u2014 the legislation that has come to carry his name and define his legacy. It was strange circumstances Obama found himself in. He was leaving office an unusually popular president, with approval numbers nearing 60 percent. But his most important domestic achievement was imperiled. Republicans had spent years slamming Obamacare for high premiums, high deductibles, high copays, and daunting complexity.",
        "President Donald Trump\u2019s baseless claim that former President Barack Obama had tapped his phones during the election has been unraveling for so long now that it\u2019s easy to lose sight of the fact that no Republicans of any stature remain willing to defend it \u2014 and that even Trump\u2019s closest aides are twisting themselves into pretzels to avoid having to explicitly concede that their boss seems to have made the entire thing up.",
        "The White House is 0 for 2 on implementing its immigration executive order, after a Hawaii court put a temporary restraining order on the revised travel ban Wednesday \u2014 and it\u2019s partly because President Donald Trump and his surrogates couldn\u2019t keep their mouths shut. Federal Judge Derrick K. Watson of Hawaii, who issued the restraining order just hours before the revised immigration order was scheduled to go into effect, brushed aside the administration\u2019s argument that the executive order did not amount to a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d that targets a particular religion.",
        "Last week, I wrote about seven things I thought probably needed to happen for the American Health Care Act to get to President Trump\u2019s desk. So why don\u2019t we check in and see how things are going? 1. Trump decides he wants a win \u2014 and doesn\u2019t care about the bill\u2019s details: There\u2019s good news and news here for Paul Ryan.",
        "President Donald Trump\u2019s second attempt at an executive order temporarily blocking refugees from entering the US, along with immigrants and travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries, was placed on hold by a Hawaii court on Wednesday. As Vox\u2019s Dara Lind writes: It was a scathing rebuke for an order that administration officials spent weeks reworking, in hopes of avoiding the judicial blockade that the first attempt sailed into in January. The temporary restraining order came from federal judge Derrick K. Watson, of the District of Hawaii.",
        "More than a third of Americans now experience chronic pain \u2014 more than those who have cancer, heart disease, and diabetes combined. And startling recent data shows that the severity of pain Americans report is increasing each year. Pain is an incredibly complicated medical issue to diagnose, measure, and treat. Prescription painkillers meant to reduce the number of Americans living in pain have instead given rise to serious opioid addiction and an overdose epidemic.",
        "The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday, in a move that every investor and economist in America saw coming because at least half a dozen Fed officials signaled it in advance. The top end of the target range for the Fed\u2019s key rate \u2014 the rate big banks charge for loans \u2014 is now 1 percent, safely above the land of rates that the US economy long inhabited in the slow recovery from the Great Recession. At least two more rate hikes are almost certainly coming this year.",
        "American Gods is one of this year\u2019s most anticipated new TV shows, and from the looks of its latest trailer, we\u2019re in for a trippy good time. The upcoming Starz series \u2014 which gave fans a sneak peek at the premiere episode during Austin\u2019s South by Southwest festival this past weekend \u2014 is based on Neil Gaiman\u2019s popular book of the same name, which described an epic clash between old gods and new ones in the modern day.",
        "Bit by bit, President Trump is starting to rewrite the multitude of policies the Obama administration put in place to fight global warming. Today\u2019s target is a big one: the fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks. In 2011, the Obama administration began crafting sweeping new rules that would steadily increase the efficiency of US passenger vehicles through 2025. By the final year, the Environmental Protection Agency expects new cars and light trucks sold in the US to average roughly 36 miles per gallon on the road, up from 25 mpg today.",
        "David Malpass, a veteran of two previous Republican Party administrations as well as a former chief economist for the investment bank Bear Stearns, has been nominated to serve as undersecretary of Treasury for international affairs. It\u2019s a critical crisis management role in the federal government, and one that Malpass certainly has the broad r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for. But despite decent paper credentials, Malpass has a striking track record of poor judgment about major economic issues over the past decade \u2014 cheerleading the economy on the verge of the Great Recession while warning of a collapse just as recovery was getting underway.",
        "A real estate company owned by the family of Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s and senior adviser in the White House, is poised to sign a lucrative sweetheart deal with the politically connected Chinese insurance giant Anbang. According to a Bloomberg report published Monday, Kushner Companies is set to receive $400 million in a deal in which Anbang will invest in the Kushner Companies\u2019 flagship Manhattan office tower at 666 Fifth Ave. The deal values their office building at $2. 85 billion, making it the highest valuation of a single Manhattan building ever.",
        "When I fretted in my review of the first season of This Is Us that the show would run out of things to do or say once it revealed the answer to its biggest mystery \u2014 how did Jack Pearson, paterfamilias of the Pearson clan, die? \u2014 I didn\u2019t actually expect the show to agree with me. But that\u2019s the only conclusion one can draw from \u201cMoonshadow,\u201d a sometimes lovely, mostly tortured season one finale that feels more like a brief pause in the middle of a sentence than it does a period at the end of said sentence.",
        "During a 1954 White House luncheon, Winston Churchill told the assembled notables that \u201cto always is better than to . \u201d Diplomacy, Churchill had come to believe, was capable of resolving conflict more reliably and at far lower cost than any kind of military action. President Trump\u2019s budget outline is what would happen if one reversed Churchill\u2019s principle entirely, and then built a government around it. The Trump budget takes the $615 billion annual defense budget, $65 billion of which goes to funding current wars, and increases it by 9 percent ($54 billion).",
        "White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the word \u201cprong\u201d 16 different times at a briefing this week. He was practicing what has become the most common way for congressional Republicans and the White House to deflect criticism of Paul Ryan\u2019s American Health Care Act \u2014 by pitching it as only the first step, or the first \u201cprong,\u201d of their much bigger \u201c \u201d health care overhaul. \u201cIt\u2019s a major, complicated piece of legislation that\u2019s got three prongs to it,\u201d Spicer said of ACHA.",
        "Tesla has a seemingly bottomless appetite for capital. The company raised $2 billion from bond investors in 2014, sold $738 million in stock in 2015, and sold $1. 46 billion in stock in 2016. Now it\u2019s planning to raise another $1. 15 billion in the coming months. Tesla needs so much cash because it has hundreds of thousands of preorders for the Model 3, Tesla\u2019s relatively affordable electric vehicle that\u2019s slated to begin production later this year. CEO Elon Musk has set a goal to produce 500, 000 cars a year between 2018 and 2020.",
        "President Donald Trump\u2019s debut budget proposal is a stark declaration of war on the future of the American economy that substitutes a curious mix of ideology and blind nostalgia for any effort to think critically about the actual needs of a nation. The war starts with reducing spending \u2014 even though an aging population, plus the government\u2019s role in inherently activities like education and care, militates overwhelmingly in favor of a somewhat larger role for the state. But it continues with the priorities Trump set for where the remaining cash gets spent.",
        "Top Republicans have spent days distancing themselves from President Donald Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated allegation that President Barack Obama tapped his phones. Now the heads of the Senate Intelligence Committee are flatly saying it didn\u2019t happen. \u201cBased on the information available to us, we see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016,\u201d the panel\u2019s chair, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, and ranking member, Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, said in a joint statement.",
        "We\u2019re not even two months into Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, and his agenda is in deep trouble. What was to be his most significant executive action \u2014 his immigration and travel \u201cban\u201d aimed at refugees and people from several predominantly Muslim countries \u2014 was dealt another blow Wednesday night, when a federal judge blocked a revised version of it just hours before it was set to go into effect.",
        "President Donald Trump\u2019s first official budget document includes massive changes to the of federal spending going to \u201cdiscretionary\u201d programs. Programs to mitigate climate change are cut or eliminated across the government. Programs to assist the poor are slashed. And while almost every department would face large cuts, three would see sizable increases in spending: Defense, Homeland Security, and Veterans Affairs. The impact of the cuts and hikes laid out in the document would be massive.",
        "President Donald Trump\u2019s budget blueprint, out today, includes devastating cuts to health research funding and public health programs \u2014 along with some vague commitments to launch a pandemic response fund and maintain funding in the fight against HIV. While the plan may be too extreme to get Congress\u2019s seal of approval, the White House is signaling a clear desire to gut some of America\u2019s health infrastructure to bolster defense spending and build a wall along the border. We\u2019ve parsed the health winners and losers in the budget for you. Here\u2019s a quick overview.",
        "Tucker Carlson\u2019s with Donald Trump Wednesday night was not exactly a interview, but the Fox News host did speak up at one point for conservative populists who are a bit skeptical of Trump\u2019s embrace of Paul Ryan\u2019s health care plan. Carlson noted that one centerpiece of the American Health Care Act is a huge tax cut for rich investors. At the same time, he added, \u201ca Bloomberg analysis shows that counties that voted for you, and counties, would do far less well under the bill than counties that voted for Hillary.\u201d Trump\u2019s response: \u201cOh, I know.",
        "The numbers of President Donald Trump\u2019s budget proposal should give the nation\u2019s scientists shivers. The administration doesn\u2019t seem to think science should be a priority at all. The blueprint released today is preliminary. The administration still needs to draft a full budget, which we won\u2019t see until May. And ultimately, it\u2019s up to Congress to decide who gets what. But what\u2019s important about this budget proposal is that it tells the public and Congress where the president\u2019s concerns lie. And they don\u2019t appear to be issues like climate change, disease treatment and prevention, or basic research funding for universities.",
        "Back in 2014, Wendy Davis was simply a Democratic lawmaker in a red state. But an filibuster against a bill that aimed to restrict Texas women\u2019s access to abortion thrust her onto the national stage, turning her into a feminist icon overnight. While she is largely known for her famous protest, the former Texas state senator and 2014 gubernatorial candidate knows change is not created in a moment but in a movement, deep and sustaining, intersectional and intergenerational. As women strike, march, and embrace electoral politics in unprecedented numbers, Davis is ready for the future of feminism.",
        "Forced to explain his allegation that President Barack Obama \u201cwiretapped\u201d Trump Tower, President Donald Trump misquoted the New York Times, said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be here if it wasn\u2019t for Twitter,\u201d and talked about how much money Celebrity Apprentice made for NBC. The explosive charge is looking more and more like purely invented bogus \u2014 White House officials are under fire for refusing to provide evidence, and even congressional Republicans are stuck refusing to defend Trump\u2019s claim. After his rally in Nashville, Tennessee, on Wednesday night, Trump sat down for an interview with Fox News\u2019s Tucker Carlson.",
        "President Donald Trump\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2018 can be read as a political document, a statement of his administration\u2019s policy priorities. Many of these proposed cuts won\u2019t get passed by Congress, but it\u2019s a look at what Trump values. And what\u2019s clear is that Trump wants the US government to pull back sharply from any effort to stop global warming, adapt to its impacts \u2014 or even study it further. Under the proposal, a wide variety of climate programs across multiple agencies would be scaled back or slashed entirely.",
        "Republicans have been warned: Any attempt to fund the southern border wall could lead to a government shutdown fight in Congress. Democrats may not have control of the House or the Senate, but when it comes to appropriating funds for the border wall, they have leverage. Congress needs to pass the appropriations bills by April 28 to keep the government open. Democrats can block the Department of Homeland Security funding in a filibuster. A delay that lasts beyond April 28 will lead to a shutdown of the department.",
        "\u201cI want everyone to know I\u2019m 100 percent behind [the American Health Care Act],\u201d President Trump said today. \u201cThe press has not been speaking properly about how great this is going to be. I watch, I say, \u2018That\u2019s not the bill we\u2019re passing.\u2019 But does Trump really know what\u2019s in the bill he\u2019s passing, or trying to pass? With the help of Vox\u2019s Jacob Gardenswartz, I collected and read absolutely everything Donald Trump has said publicly about the AHCA. The transcripts cover speeches, rallies, meetings with congressional leaders, interviews with friendly news outlets, and, of course, tweets."
