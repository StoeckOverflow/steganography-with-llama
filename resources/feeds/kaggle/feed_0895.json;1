        "The night of the presidential election marked a turning point for The Late Show With Stephen Colbert \u2014 but not because of anything that happened on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. As the election results rolled in on November 8, Colbert was hosting a live Showtime special that was clearly conceived in anticipation of Hillary Clinton defeating Donald Trump to win the presidency \u2014 rather than the other way around \u2014 as so many people and polls had predicted.",
        "Of all the cuts proposed in President Trump\u2019s new budget, the proposal to eliminate federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is perhaps most poorly understood. Because the CPB is an umbrella agency involved with PBS and NPR, any time the government considers cuts to the agency, it\u2019s usually interpreted as the government defunding Sesame Street (which airs in first run on HBO now, before being rerun on PBS) or some other PBS Kids production.",
        "During the campaign, Donald Trump billed himself as the \u201clast shot\u201d for coal country. He alone could save regions like Appalachia that had long suffered from poverty and dwindling coal jobs. And voters in West Virginia and eastern Kentucky believed him \u2014 choosing Trump over Hillary Clinton by wide, wide margins. So it\u2019s striking that President Trump\u2019s first budget proposal would slash and burn several key programs aimed at promoting economic development in coal regions \u2014 most notably, the Appalachian Regional Commission and the Economic Development Administration.",
        "There are two men. They have nearly identical bodies, with close to the same height and weight. Which one is larger? Which one is more threatening? Which one could do more harm to you? Most people would probably think to answer \u201cneither,\u201d since both men are the same size. But according to a new series of studies published by the American Psychological Association, a person\u2019s answer to these questions depends largely on the men\u2019s race \u2014 and that, researchers warn, may lead people to justify greater use of force against black men compared to their white counterparts.",
        "In the crush of news, it\u2019s easy to lose perspective. And this year especially, it\u2019s easy for the abnormal to become normal. So let\u2019s be clear: If President Trump truly does have no evidence to back up his accusation that President Obama tapped his phones \u2014 as increasingly seems to be the case \u2014 he has viciously slandered his predecessor with a bogus accusation.",
        "During a CNN Health Care Town Hall on Wednesday, Dana Bash asked Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price about what would happen to the women who rely on Planned Parenthood for health care if the organization were to be defunded. Specifically, she asked about those who live in the 105 counties where Planned Parenthood is the only clinic that offers women the full range of contraceptive services. \u201cWell, I\u2019d be interested in the list you have,\u201d Price replied.",
        "Speaking to National Review editor Rich Lowry at an event hosted by the conservative magazine, House Speaker Paul Ryan made the case for the American Health Care Act by presenting it as a opportunity to cut Medicaid spending. \u201cWe\u2019ve been dreaming of this since I\u2019ve been around,\u201d Ryan says, before interrupting himself to clarify exactly how big of an opportunity this is, \u201csince you and I were drinking out of kegs. \u201d Disgusting. @PRyan says he\u2019s been \u201ddreaming\u201d of capping health insurance funds for Americans since he was drinking out of kegs. pic. twitter.",
        "Briefing journalists today, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney cited the Meals on Wheels program as an example of spending money on something that \u201csounds great\u201d but is \u201cnot showing any results. \u201d The basic result of delivering meals to seniors is, of course, food being consumed. But as it happens, Mulvaney is mistaken, and the program shows a range of broader results than that. Mulvaney just said Meals on Wheels \u201dsounds great\u201d but it\u2019s one of those programs \u201dnot showing any results\u201d \u2014 via @MSNBC pic. twitter.",
        "The health care debate is, as of late, all about the prongs \u2014 three prongs, to be exact. All the most powerful Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and White House press secretary Sean Spicer, are talking about the \u201d \u201d strategy to repeal and replace Obamacare. My colleague Jeff Stein wrote an excellent explainer on this. It made one thing exceptionally clear to me: Trying to move repeal and replace through the process will be really difficult. It\u2019s not clear that all the prongs can even happen. Here\u2019s a perusal of the prongs \u2014 and their problems.",
        "Standing just feet away from President Donald Trump, Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny on Thursday bashed the basic foundation of views that carried Trump to the presidency. In his remarks, Kenny launched into a lengthy monologue about St. Patrick, whom the White House proceedings were honoring. Kenny said: It\u2019s fitting that we gather here each year to celebrate St. Patrick and his legacy. He too of course was an immigrant. And though he is, of course, the patron saint of Ireland, for many people around the globe he\u2019s also a symbol of \u2014 indeed the patron of \u2014 immigrants.",
        "Back in 2014, when we were busy smugly predicting that the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge wouldn\u2019t cure anything but were still doing it anyway, we were working for a company that edited and rewrote folks\u2019 r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. It was a pretty straightforward business model \u2014 our clients would email us their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, and we\u2019d email them back with edits and questions until the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was as solid as we could make it. Our only interaction with clients was over email, and in the comment bubbles on their documents. No phone conversations, no .",
        "Beauty and the Beast, Disney\u2019s fairytale romance, is the story of a hybrid who falls in love with a human woman; of servants cursed and turned into flatware and other household items; of Stockholm syndrome; of an abusive misogynist who eats five dozen eggs a day. But the thing that has gotten people really upset about the new film \u2014 a remake of the 1991 animated classic \u2014 is that one of its characters is gay.",
        "In his first address to Congress, President Trump cited a recent National Academy of Sciences report to argue in favor of a radical overhaul of the American immigration system. In particular, he used the NAS report to support his claim that the American economy is hurt by immigrants. Here is his reference to the report, in context (emphasis added): The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers. Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others \u2014 have a immigration system.",
        "You may think people grow beards because of their fashionability or warmth, but author and professor Stephen Mihm says there might be another reason. In a New York Times piece, he makes the case that in Western countries, trends in beard popularity often closely follow trends in capitalism. During the century, communists and other labor radicals donned bushy Karl Marx \u2014 style beards as a form of protest. Members of the business community viewed these movements as scary and threatening to the establishment, and as a result, beards became verboten in general society.",
        "Now that it\u2019s clear opioid painkillers have helped cause the worst drug epidemic in history, health experts are scrambling to figure out when dependency on these powerful prescription drugs starts \u2014 and how to prevent it. A new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked at the relationship between the number of days of someone\u2019s first opioid prescription and their use. It found that that number has a huge impact: Patients face an increased risk of opioid dependency in as few as four days of taking the drugs.",
        "FBI Director James Comey has just dropped a bombshell \u2014 confirming for the first time that the FBI is investigating links between Trump allies and Russia. \u201c[The FBI is] investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia\u2019s efforts,\u201d Comey said. Comey\u2019s comments were a direct rebuke to President Trump, who has long tried to argue that concerns about potential Russian involvement had been ginned up by Democrats for political gain.",
        "It\u2019s official: Each of President Donald Trump\u2019s claims about President Obama wiretapping him during the presidential election has now been officially debunked, under oath, by FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers. The statements came during a House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence hearing looking into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election on Monday. Comey also officially stated on the record that the FBI is in fact currently investigating links between Trump allies and Russia.",
        "The Republican replacement plan for Obamacare hurts the most vulnerable people in our society: poorer and older Americans. But the Republican plan does benefit some people, albeit at the expense of 24 million who would lose insurance by 2026. So where do you fit into this? That\u2019s what this calculator is for. How we made it To create this calculator, we worked with Urban Institute researcher Linda Blumberg, who extrapolated how much insurance premiums would cost on average for all people under 64.",
        "When Antonin Scalia\u2019s death was announced, Neil Gorsuch was on the ski slope. Checking his phone halfway down the hill, tears welled up as he read the news, he has said. According to Gorsuch, who is President Trump\u2019s nominee to replace Scalia on the Supreme Court, Scalia was \u201ca lion of the law\u201d whose judicial philosophy was exactly right: A judge must apply the law as it is, and never as the judge prefers it to be.",
        "These are strange, unsettling times. And for the past several months, I\u2019ve been asking psychologists variations on a basic question: What research can best help us reckon with uncomfortable social and political realities \u2014 like the rise of Donald Trump, the widening partisan split, the divisiveness that comes with multiculturalism? More than ever before, people of different ideological backgrounds seem to live in separate universes. One example: In the days after the inauguration, social scientists showed participants photos of Trump\u2019s inaugural crowd and Obama\u2019s.",
        "One of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s most infamous quotes was something she said during a speech to the National Association of Counties\u2019 2010 legislative conference. Congress was considering the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and the endless, breathless coverage of the contentious process, Pelosi explained, was preventing people from appreciating the significance of its contents. \u201cWe have to pass the bill,\u201d she said, \u201cso that you can find out what is in it \u2014 away from the fog of the controversy.",
        "Health care provider groups \u2014 representatives of America\u2019s doctors, hospitals, and other caregivers \u2014 have generally been critical of the Republican American Health Care Act, but in a fairly restrained way. Bob Doherty, senior vice president for government affairs at the American College of Physicians, the trade group for internists and the association of doctors in America, is taking a different approach on Twitter this morning, blasting the bill as the worst measure he\u2019s seen in nearly 40 years of advocacy work.",
        "Two American billionaires with extremely divergent worldviews are engaging in a quiet war of rhetoric about global health and development. One is Bill Gates; the other is Donald Trump. On Monday, Gates is scheduled to meet with the president. And ahead of that meeting, Gates has been putting out articles and letters that seem like thinly veiled arguments against Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to foreign aid. In a Time magazine opinion article on Friday, Gates argued for why the cuts to global health in Trump\u2019s budget proposal last week would actually make Americans sicker and less safe.",
        "Lawrence Krauss wants you to see the poetry in the universe. A theoretical physicist, Krauss proclaimed in a recent talk: \u201dEvery atom in your body came from a star that exploded, and the atoms in your left hand probably came from a different star than your right hand. It really is the most poetic thing I know about physics: You are all stardust.\u201d Krauss, who is the director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University, has emerged in recent years as one of the leading advocates for science and reason in public life.",
        "Mark Zuckerberg popularized the slogan \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d to describe the breakneck pace of innovation at Facebook, and the phrase has become popular across Silicon Valley. So what happens when technology companies start to build a technology \u2014 cars \u2014 that can literally move fast and break not just things but people? It\u2019s a crucial question not only for the major Silicon Valley companies working on technology \u2014 including Google, Uber, and Tesla \u2014 but also for regulators. The balance is tricky: If regulators are too lax, people could die from malfunctioning vehicles.",
        "In Iran, the idea of \u201dspring cleaning\u201d isn\u2019t just a seasonal excuse to gut your closet; it\u2019s the basis of a national holiday dating back millennia. Every year, millions of Iranians celebrate Persian New Year, or Nowruz (prounced \u201d \u201d). In Iran, the new year begins with the advent of spring, and most everyone in the country \u2014 not to mention the millions of Iranians living elsewhere around the world \u2014 observe it by doing a deep clean of their homes, celebrating a season of new life, and wishing for good luck in the year ahead.",
        "Americans are blasted daily with news about Russia. The CIA and FBI believe the Russian government stole information from the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election to hurt Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances and help Donald Trump. Intelligence committees in the House and Senate are probing the extent of Moscow\u2019s interference in the elections. Reporters have dug up ties and meetings between various Trump aides and Russian government officials, prompting the resignation of Trump\u2019s national security adviser and threatening the future of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The country dominates our headlines.",
        "On Friday, Marvel and Netflix unleashed 13 episodes of the first season of Iron Fist upon the world \u2014 and it is the single worst thing the superhero television factory has ever created. This series takes everything good Marvel has done on a joy ride, then returns it scratched, bruised, and smelling like patchouli and broken promises. After the slog, I\u2019m not angry \u2014 I\u2019m just disappointed. Rating Disappointed, but not particularly surprised. After all, from concept to release, Iron Fist has been a challenge. Iron Fist isn\u2019t really one of Marvel\u2019s most compelling heroes.",
        "A feature of the House Republican health care bill is that its premium subsidies are not tailored by income. A who earns $22, 000 gets the same $4, 000 tax credit as one who earns $75, 000 \u2014 a sharp departure from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s approach. Less noticed but potentially just as controversial is that the proposed tax credit is not \u201cgeographically adjusted. \u201d It provides the same subsidy to someone in Kentucky as to someone in Alaska \u2014 even though Alaska\u2019s premiums are more than twice as high.",
        "House Speaker Paul Ryan still appears to be short of the votes he needs to pass the American Health Care Act, but he\u2019s been picking off a few wavering moderates and conservatives here and there as the vote \u2014 scheduled for Thursday \u2014 draws nearer. Will it be enough? I don\u2019t know, and neither does Ryan. So rather than trying to predict the future, let\u2019s look to the past for some scenarios about how big votes like this one tend to play out. Four come to mind."
