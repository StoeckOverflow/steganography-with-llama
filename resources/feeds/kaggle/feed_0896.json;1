        "Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is scheduled to skip an April meeting of NATO foreign ministers to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Washington, giving a cold shoulder to many of Washington\u2019s closest allies. Experts on Washington\u2019s delicate diplomatic relationship with Europe had surprisingly undiplomatic reactions. \u201cUnprecedented,\u201d Ivo Daalder, former US ambassador to NATO and current president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, said of Tillerson\u2019s decision. \u201cUS allies are alarmed and worried,\u201d Jenny Mathers, a Russia expert at Aberystwyth University, told me.",
        "Early on Tuesday, the federal government notified airlines serving 10 airports in countries that sometime before Friday, airlines will have to prevent passengers from carrying on laptops, tablets, or electronic cameras on flights from those airports to the US. The \u201claptop ban\u201d had been rumored throughout the day Monday, due in part to a tweet from the Royal Jordanian airline. Initial reports made the new requirement seem sudden and hectic \u2014 and maybe, given the track record of the Trump administration with countries, ideologically motivated.",
        "The American Health Care Act \u2014 House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s and President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to replace Obamacare \u2014 was in its original form a truly massive cut to Medicaid. It slashed the program by $880 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It would eventually unwind the Medicaid expansion included in the Affordable Care Act and slash the yearly growth rate for Medicaid spending, forcing states to provide worse coverage or to kick people off the rolls. Now it\u2019s about to get harsher.",
        "For much of the past century, the rate at which humans pumped carbon dioxide into the atmosphere increased inexorably year after year, and it seemed like we\u2019d never make any progress on this big honking climate change problem. But over the past three years, something genuinely shocking has happened. Global CO2 emissions from energy have stayed flat, even as the world economy has kept chugging along, according to a new report by the International Energy Agency.",
        "Imagine someone had told you, a few years ago, that the FBI would soon be investigating a possible plot by a Republican presidential campaign to help Russia interfere in the US election \u2014 and that this interference had ultimately helped Donald J. Trump become president of the United States. You would have laughed in their face, or maybe accused them of confusing reality with a particularly lurid Tom Clancy novel. But we learned on Monday morning that this is absolutely, 100 percent, without a doubt our reality.",
        "The planned House vote on the American Health Care Act Thursday is being interpreted as a major test for Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. If it fails, the thinking goes, he\u2019ll have fallen victim to a humiliating defeat that will imperil the rest of his agenda. But perhaps Trump should be thinking more about the risks of success. This is such a giant mess, and everyone knows it, and they might pass this thing anyway.",
        "Almost exactly a year ago, a widely shared article in the New York Daily News alerted the world that Richard Simmons \u2014 the beloved \u201880s fitness guru whose peppy enthusiasm and flamboyance became forever associated with the decade \u2014 had not been seen in public since February 2014. The article, citing a close friend of Simmons, raised the disconcerting possibility that Simmons was somehow being held captive against his will or was being coerced to remain in his own house by a manipulative housekeeper.",
        "Last fall, Uber hired Jeff Jones, Target\u2019s former chief marketing officer, to serve as president of the company\u2019s core business, with a mandate to improve relationships with Uber drivers and counteract the company\u2019s increasingly negative public image. But Jones couldn\u2019t solve those problems, and over the weekend he resigned in a way that will exacerbate them, telling Recode\u2019s Kara Swisher and Johana Bhuiyan that \u201cthe beliefs and approach to leadership that have guided my career are inconsistent with what I saw and experienced at Uber.",
        "Even though it was 15 years ago, I still remember the first time I helped deliver Meals on Wheels. I was in college at the time, I had very little clue what the program even was. All I knew was that a lady from my campus church was asking for volunteers to help her deliver meals to nearby seniors. So, I met up with her and the other volunteers in my 1983 Plymouth Colt at a nearby senior center to pick up the food.",
        "This is the fun part of the legislative process for President Donald Trump. Two days out from the House\u2019s expected vote on the Republican health bill, Trump paid a visit to House Republicans to close the deal on the American Health Care Act. Still, the bill\u2019s harshest conservative critics say Trump\u2019s methods didn\u2019t work \u2014 and some key conservative voices House Speaker Paul Ryan had been hoping to win over still look like they\u2019re \u201cno\u201d votes. House Freedom Caucus Chair Rep.",
        "NEWARK, New Jersey \u2014 The one thing that makes Jessica Goense really brighten up is her dream of becoming a chef and owning her own restaurant. She describes it as her fate. \u201cI\u2019m Italian,\u201d she quipped. \u201cThe olive oil runs in my veins. \u201d It\u2019s been a long road to a point where that dream might finally become reality. At just 11 years old, Goense began using marijuana and drinking. At 15, she progressed to heroin. Now 29, she\u2019s not proud of the things she did to get drugs, from prostitution to stealing.",
        "In 2006, at a Federalist Society gathering in Puerto Rico, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia gave a speech about his \u201coriginalist\u201d or \u201cstrict constructionist\u201d judicial philosophy. He rejected roundly the idea that the Constitution is a \u201cliving\u201d document: That\u2019s the argument of flexibility and it goes something like this: The Constitution is over 200 years old and societies change. It has to change with society, like a living organism, or it will become brittle and break. But you would have to be an idiot to believe that. The Constitution is not a living organism, it is a legal document.",
        "In 2009, Democrats scrambling to pass Obamacare carved out a special exemption from new Medicaid payments for Nebraska. The exemption was designed entirely to win over the vote of the state\u2019s Democratic senator, Ben Nelson. Conservatives mocked the giveaway as the \u201cCornhusker Kickback. \u201d Now trying to pass a health care bill of their own, Republicans have created their own special rule to win over moderates in the GOP\u2019s New York delegation. Critics have already nicknamed it the \u201cBuffalo Buyout,\u201d the \u201cTammany Haul,\u201d and the \u201cUpstate Shakedown.",
        "Rep. Devin Nunes, chair of the House Permanent Subcommittee on Intelligence, held a hastily convened press conference on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. Standing in a hallway in front of a staircase, he announced that he had startling information to share: The US government had intercepted communications between Trump\u2019s transition team and foreign nationals in the three months prior to Trump taking office. \u201cOn numerous occasions, the intelligence community incidentally collected information about US citizens involved in the Trump transition,\u201d Nunes announced.",
        "British authorities have identified the suspected perpetrator of Wednesday\u2019s bloody attack outside the parliament complex in central London that left five dead, including one police officer and the assailant, and at least 30 wounded, some grievously. Law enforcement personnel said Khalid Masood, 52, carried out the assault, the deadliest terror attack in London in more than a decade. Masood, whose birth name was Adrian Russell Ajao, was born in Kent, England. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, but police have said they believe Masood was acting alone.",

But if they don\u2019t, a major reason will be that President Trump\u2019s closing argument was weak.",
        "Here\u2019s a reasonable fear: 20 years from now, very few people are going to agree on the details of our shared history. Recently, I spoke Henry \u201cRoddy\u201d Roediger, a psychologist at Washington University in St. Louis, one of the world\u2019s leading experts on memory and learning. In recent years, he has focused his research on a what\u2019s known as \u201ccollective memory,\u201d or the tendency for groups of people to form unique \u2014 and biased \u2014 narratives about events. His research and others\u2019 paint a grim picture for the future.",
        "The fate of the Republican health bill in the House could rest on President Donald Trump\u2019s salesmanship. He pitched himself as the ultimate dealmaker during the campaign, and Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s office has lately been hyping him up as \u201cthe ultimate closer. \u201d With Republicans still short on votes, his intercession may be the only thing that can save them. Yet there\u2019s one glaring oddity in the pitch Trump\u2019s been making: It doesn\u2019t include anything even remotely resembling an affirmative case for the actual bill House Republicans have to vote on.",
        "Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort stepped down last August in the wake of reports of his murky financial dealings with Ukrainian leaders. Former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was pushed out of the White House in February after lying about his communications with Moscow. Now new information suggests that both men\u2019s relationships with Russian interests may have been considerably more extensive, and involved far more money, than was previously known. Take Manafort, the former campaign head.",
        "If you watch or read the news lately, you might think that an amazing new miracle drug to combat high cholesterol is about to change the world. Last week, the New England Journal of Medicine published a big new study about a cholesterol drug called Repatha. The hype has been pretty hard to miss. news is trumpeting a \u201cbreakthrough,\u201d anecdotes about patient miracles abound, and there have been commercials urging people to ask their doctor about the treatment. When the Food and Drug Administration first approved Repatha in 2015, it indeed seemed promising.",
        "Australian documentarian Anna Broinowski traveled to North Korea in 2012 for an unusual purpose: to make a documentary in the style of a North Korean propaganda film. After receiving a copy of Kim Jong Il\u2019s propaganda manifesto The Cinema and Directing as a joke gift, Broinowski became fascinated with the supreme leader\u2019s passion for filmmaking. She decided to visit the notoriously closed country to learn about its propaganda industry. After a long application process, she was granted access to the country\u2019s filmmakers.",
        "Back in November 2009, as the Obama backlash was just gathering steam, Rush Limbaugh devoted a segment of his radio program to \u201cClimategate. \u201d That was the episode in which a climate research institute was hacked and the private emails of scientists were leaked. Conservative media sifted through the emails, stripping individual sentences and phrases out of context and spinning them to look sinister, as though scientists were coordinating and manipulating results. Mainstream media dutifully covered the \u201ccontroversy.",
        "It was early March, and Israeli police were questioning Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as part of a burgeoning corruption probe that could force him out of power \u2014 and potentially even send him to jail \u2014 when the phone rang at Netanyahu\u2019s official residence in Jerusalem. The caller was President Donald Trump. Netanyahu excused himself and took the call. According to his office, the two leaders discussed the Trump administration\u2019s Iran strategy for several minutes, after which the interrogation resumed.",
        "In the race to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle have been guilty of spreading erroneous statements, exaggerating the truth, and skimping on context. That\u2019s the takeaway from a review by ProPublica and its partners at Kaiser Health News, Stat, and Vox of more than 200 letters that members of Congress sent out to their constituents in response to the public\u2019s questions and concerns about the Affordable Care Act and its proposed replacement, the GOP\u2019s American Health Care Act.",
        "The typical family making less than $10, 000 will lose $1, 420 if the Republican health care plan passes, a cut that amounts to almost of their income. Meanwhile, the average family making $200, 000 or more would gain $5, 640, according to a new analysis from the Tax Policy Center and the Urban Institute\u2019s Health Policy Center: The report combines an analysis of the tax provisions of the act \u2014 which repeal the taxes the Affordable Care Act imposed largely on rich people, like a 3. 8 percent surtax on investment income over $250, 000 and a 0.",
        "Ivanka Trump\u2019s power behind the scenes in the White House is now really, truly official. The president\u2019s daughter, who already had a West Wing Office, a security clearance, and a phone, will become an unpaid government employee with the title of special assistant to the president, according to the New York Times. That title is a shift from her earlier plans, which would have given her the office and the clearance without the official status. As a White House employee, even an unpaid one, Trump, like her husband, Jared Kushner, will have to abide by federal ethics regulations.",
        "A lot of weird stuff happened over the past seven days in American politics that might make President Trump\u2019s party skeptical of him. The Trump administration provoked a minor international incident with the United Kingdom by accusing its surveillance agency of complicity in an illegal scheme to subject Trump\u2019s campaign to surveillance. The directors of the FBI and the National Security Agency, plus the chairs of the congressional intelligence committees, rebuked the president for lying about these surveillance issues.",
        "I don\u2019t need to be here. I have friends. It\u2019s a line I repeated to myself, a line I almost blurted out loud, at a \u201cfriend speed dating\u201d event I attended in Washington, DC, earlier this year. It was designed for women in their 20s and 30s to find not love, but friendship. For two hours, scores of women paraded in front of me like a Golden Corral buffet. The same scent of desperation and loneliness that characterizes actual speed dating events on TV permeated the air. And so I kept telling myself: I\u2019m not like them.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has reached a new level of chaos, somehow. Last night, CNN reported that the FBI \u201chas information that indicates\u201d Trump\u2019s associates communicated with Russian operatives, \u201cpossibly\u201d to coordinate the release of information damaging to his opponent\u2019s campaign. That\u2019s just days after the FBI director revealed, in congressional testimony, that he was investigating whether the president\u2019s associates colluded with Russia to interfere with last year\u2019s election \u2014 publicly confirming something we knew of only from anonymously sourced news reports.",
        "If it passes, the American Health Care Act will be Donald Trump and Paul Ryan\u2019s Iraq War. It\u2019s been sold with lies. It\u2019s been pushed forward with a legislative strategy. And its architects are woefully unprepared for the chaos it would unleash upon passage. There is an honest argument that could have been made for the AHCA. Conservatives believe it is not the government\u2019s responsibility to ensure the poor can afford decent health insurance."
