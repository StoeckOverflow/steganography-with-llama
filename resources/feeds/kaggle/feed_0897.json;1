        "Obamacare repeal is done. On Friday afternoon, almost at the exact same time the House of Representatives was set to vote on the American Health Care Act (AHCA) the bill was suddenly pulled from the floor, and the House went into recess. House Speaker Paul Ryan later confirmed at a press conference that the bill is effectively dead. \u201cObamacare is the law of the land,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future. \u201d By the latest count, the bill was facing tough odds. Rep.",
        "It\u2019s official: Senate Democrats are going to try to filibuster Neil Gorsuch\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stated in a Senate floor speech that Gorsuch \u201calmost instinctively favors the powerful over the weak,\u201d and is \u201cnot a neutral legal mind but someone with a conservative ideology. \u201d (function( d, s, id) (document, \u2019script\u2019 \u2019 \u2019)); Senator Schumer Explains Why He will Vote No on Judge Gorsuch\u2019.",
        "On Thursday, a bunch of men met at the White House to discuss taking away potentially millions of women\u2019s coverage for pregnancy, maternity, and newborn care. The White House meeting was broadly about the American Health Care Act, the Republican bill meant to repeal and replace Obamacare. But it was focused on whether the bill should include a repeal of 10 \u201cessential health benefits\u201d that insurers in the individual marketplace must cover. Among those benefits is pregnancy, maternity, and newborn care.",
        "Back in 2015, the world\u2019s governments met in Paris and agreed to keep global warming below 2\u00b0C, to avoid the worst risks of a hotter planet. See here for background on why, but that\u2019s the goal. For context, the planet\u2019s warmed ~1\u00b0C since the 19th century. One problem with framing the goal this way, though, is that it\u2019s maddeningly abstract. What does staying below 2\u00b0C entail?",
        "Here is a real series events that took place over the course of the past week in Washington: On Monday, during a hearing of the House Permanent Subcommittee on Intelligence, the heads of the FBI and NSA categorically denied President Donald Trump\u2019s tweets claiming that President Barack Obama ordered the US intelligence community to wiretap Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential campaign. Sometime between the hearing and Wednesday morning, the committee\u2019s chair, Devin Nunes, received a tip from an unnamed source that US intelligence had picked up the communications of some Trump staff during the presidential transition.",
        "If you ever want to see fairy tale nerds have a rumble, ask them whether or not \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d is a feminist story. Disney has remained stalwartly on the affirmative side of the argument ever since it made its first version of Beauty and the Beast in 1991, when it positioned Belle as the studio\u2019s \u201cfirst feminist princess.",
        "Israeli police have arrested a Jewish man with dual citizenship as the main suspect in hundreds of bomb threats made against Jewish community centers in the US and worldwide. In just the first three months of 2017, there have already been more than 160 bomb threats against Jewish organizations and day schools within the US, according to the League. The man arrested on Thursday in Israel is suspected of being behind most of those threats, in addition to threats against communities in Europe, Australia and New Zealand.",
        "In 2015, a blockbuster study came to a surprising conclusion: white Americans are dying younger for the first time in decades, despite positive life expectancy trends in other wealthy countries and other segments of the US population. The research, by Princeton University\u2019s Anne Case and Angus Deaton, highlighted the links between economic struggles, suicides, and alcohol and drug overdoses. Since then, Case and Deaton have been working to more fully explain their findings. They\u2019ve now come to a compelling conclusion: It\u2019s complicated.",
        "In an exclusive interview with Time\u2019s Michael Scherer, published Thursday, President Donald Trump basically gives three types of explanations for why it\u2019s okay for him to say things that aren\u2019t true. Trump thinks it\u2019s okay to repeat a false claim as long as he is accurately stating the fact that someone else made the false claim. He thinks it\u2019s okay to say something false as long as it later turns out that something vaguely similar is true. And he appears to think it\u2019s okay to just lie and then keep lying for no reason.",
        "As the White House and Republicans in Congress desperately try to craft a Obamacare repeal bill, even as it becomes clear that anything they come up with will go either too far for members of Congress who fear their constituents losing insurance or not far enough for Freedom Caucus members, let me offer a simple suggestion: Just repeal the taxes and go home. You can split Obamacare into three parts.",
        "The loose agglomeration of conservatives known as the House Freedom Caucus routinely threatened to derail the government during the presidency of Barack Obama. Now, they\u2019re threatening to derail the top legislative priority of President Donald Trump. On the morning of the day the House is supposed to vote on the American Health Care Act, the White House \u2014 facing enough defections from both the Freedom Caucus on the right and a \u201ccoverage caucus\u201d of Republicans \u2014 is negotiating directly with the Freedom Caucus to try to win over its support.",
        "America is in the middle of its deadliest drug crisis ever. With all the other news going on, it can be easy to lose track of this fact. But it\u2019s true: In 2015, more than 52, 000 people died of drug overdoses, nearly of which were linked to opioids like Percocet, OxyContin, heroin, and fentanyl. That\u2019s more drug overdose deaths than any other period in US history \u2014 even more than past heroin epidemics, the crack epidemic, or the recent meth epidemic.",
        "Politico\u2019s Josh Dawsey and Jennifer Haberkorn report that the White House is in negotiations with the House Freedom Caucus about getting the caucus\u2019s conservative members to support the American Health Care Act, the Obamacare repeal package put forward by House Speaker Paul Ryan and backed by President Trump. Key to the deal, they report, are changes to the law that would eliminate the Affordable Care Act\u2019s \u201cessential health benefits,\u201d a list of 10 categories of procedure that all insurance plans offered to individuals or small businesses must cover. The 10 are, in the words of Healthcare.",
        "CNN just dropped a bombshell report about President Donald Trump\u2019s potential ties to Russia: The FBI has information that indicates associates of President Donald Trump communicated with suspected Russian operatives to possibly coordinate the release of information damaging to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, US officials told CNN. There are a lot of unanswered questions in this. Who were the Trump associates and Russian officials? How exactly did these different people communicate and possibly coordinate? Is CNN\u2019s report even reliable, given that it cites anonymous US officials? But the report, if true, is big.",
        "Let\u2019s be clear about what happened here. The American Health Care Act failed because it was a terrible piece of legislation. It would have thrown 24 million people off insurance and raised deductibles for millions more \u2014 and the savings would\u2019ve gone to pay for tax cuts for millionaires. It broke virtually all of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign promises, and was opposed not just by Democrats but also by Republicans.",
        "Donald Trump promised to be a different kind of president. He was a populist fighting on behalf of the \u201cforgotten man,\u201d taking on the GOP establishment, draining the Washington swamp, protecting Medicaid from cuts, vowing to cover everyone with health care and make the government pay for it. He was a pragmatic businessman who was going to make Washington work for you, the little guy, not the ideologues and special interests. Instead, Trump has become a pitchman for Paul Ryan and his agenda.",
        "President Donald Trump is supposed to be the . He\u2019s supposed to get the deals his predecessors couldn\u2019t get, the concessions they couldn\u2019t make, the wins they couldn\u2019t find. Instead, Trump signed onto the first health care bill Paul Ryan came up with only to watch it go down in flames. As I write this, the question has moved from whether the bill will pass to whether Trump can force a House vote to humiliate Ryan. So what the hell happened? The answer can be found in Trump Steaks. And Trump University. And Trump Vodka. And Trump Suits.",
        "It was the biggest workplace immigration raid the US had seen to date. On May 12, 2008, 389 workers, almost all of them Hispanic, were detained at a kosher meatpacking plant in Postville, Iowa. They were taken to a cattle show ground in nearby Waterloo and tried in groups as large as 10 at a time. Most were imprisoned and then deported. The workers were traumatized, but so were their family members. \u201cI just remember sinking into my desk and just crying,\u201d Pedro Lopez Vega says, thinking back to the day he found out his mother had been detained.",
        "Pop culture can range from thrilling to frustrating, escapist to educational. And between books, movies, music, podcasts, and the glut of TV, there\u2019s a lot of it to keep up with, especially if you\u2019re interested in ever going outside or just, you know, being a part of the world.",
        "Egypt\u2019s longtime strongman dictator Hosni Mubarak was released Friday morning from the hospital, where he has been both prisoner and patient for most of the past six years. The returned to his mansion in a suburb of Cairo to live out his days as a free man. Mubarak\u2019s release had been expected after he was acquitted earlier this month on charges of inciting the deaths of hundreds of demonstrators during the uprising in January 2011 that ended with his ouster. An appeals court overturned the 2012 court decision that found the leader guilty of incitement to kill protestors.",
        "The chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, has spent the week trying to help President Trump deal with the aftermath of the collapse of Trump\u2019s wiretapping allegations and the FBI\u2019s formal confirmation that it\u2019s probing the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia. Instead, Nunes, a Congress member from California, may end up making Trump\u2019s Russia problems worse. The latest stumble came Friday, when Nunes abruptly canceled a planned public hearing with top former national security officials about Russian interference in the 2016 election.",
        "For Mary Saville, 41, giving birth to four children in the US has brought joy, but also stress and worry about how to pay for them. Saville, a nonprofit worker now based in Tampa, Florida, had her children while covered by just about every kind of health insurance plan you can imagine as she followed her husband\u2019s transient work as a pastor and teacher. But one thread connected them all: medical bills and severe financial strain. \u201cI would have these kids again in a heartbeat,\u201d she said.",
        "\u201cFirst you get the votes, then you take the vote,\u201d the Washington saying goes. Paul Ryan failed to get the votes for his health bill. So he\u2019s not taking the vote. Republican leaders told members of Congress Friday that the House vote on the American Health Care Act, which President Donald Trump demanded for Friday, will not in fact happen. President Trump just called me. Still on phone. \u201dWe just pulled it,\u201d he tells me.",
        "The only expectation anyone should have when going to see a Power Rangers movie is that in exchange for your ticket price, you will be able to sit in a dark room and enjoy a story involving dinosaurs, robots, and karate. The writing should twist itself into a pretzel for the sole purpose of bringing in more dinosaurs, more robots, and more karate. The only logic the story needs is logic that justifies the presence of dinosaurs, robots, and karate. And the only theme that matters is \u201cdinosaurs, robots, and karate.",
        "The March for Science, planned for April 22 on the National Mall in Washington, DC, has a lot of momentum in its favor. President Donald Trump\u2019s blueprint budget proposal released last week contains cuts that would \u201dcripple\u201d science funding as we know it. Many scientists are livid. The rally on the Mall and the satellite demonstrations across the globe seem likely to attract at least thousands. The movement has received endorsement from the country\u2019s major science interest organizations, which are powerful nonpartisan sources of science advocacy. So why the planning for it \u201dplagued by infighting\u201d?",
        "The idea of defunding public media in the United States, as President Trump\u2019s new budget proposes, is nothing new according to Shane Iverson, \u201cbut it\u2019s serious every time it happens. \u201d Iverson is the general manager of a small public broadcast station in Bethel, Alaska \u2014 one of the only reliable news sources in the Bethel Census Area. And if the Trump budget were to pass, it would cut funding to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting \u2014 which would in turn mean that his station might not get the money it needs to stay open.",
        "Wednesday night, CNN dropped what seemed like a bombshell of a story: \u201cThe FBI has information that indicates associates of President Donald Trump communicated with suspected Russian operatives to possibly coordinate the release of information damaging to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign,\u201d reported CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown, Evan Perez, and Shimon Prokupecz. The FBI\u2019s evidence reportedly includes \u201chuman intelligence, travel, business and phone records, and accounts of meetings.",
        "We\u2019re excited to announce our first round of featured participants for Vox Conversations, our unconference series that unites voices around the country to talk about new ideas for the future.

        "In 2006, Pluto was demoted from a planet to a dwarf planet. The reason: Pluto wasn\u2019t special anymore. Astronomers had discovered many other objects in Pluto\u2019s section of the solar system, called the Kuiper belt. If Pluto was a planet, why wasn\u2019t Eris? Or Haumea or Makemake? As Vox explained in 2015, there are likely dozens more objects in the Kuiper belt. That, combined with the fact that Pluto is tiny, closed the case: Pluto was to be known as a dwarf planet. But then something unexpected happened: Pluto became incredibly fascinating.",

What\u2019s the first piece of media you consume every day? The weather on my smartphone. Next, New York Times articles forwarded to me by my wife. Name a writer or publication you disagree with but still read. The National Review, on occasion. An attempt to understand the brain wiring of as many points of view as I can. Who is the person who has most influenced the way you think?"
