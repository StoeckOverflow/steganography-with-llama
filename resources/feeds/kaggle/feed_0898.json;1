        "It\u2019s time to get the team together. A new trailer for Warner Bros.\u2019 Justice League debuted on Saturday, providing our second official look \u2014 the first trailer premiered last July during San Diego \u2014 at the studio\u2019s counter to Marvel\u2019s Avengers. Previously, we saw Batman (Ben Affleck) assembling the Justice League and making elevator pitches to the likes of Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and the Flash (Ezra Miller).",
        "Welcome back to the weekly Vox book link roundup, a curated collection of the best recent writing on books and related subjects. Here\u2019s the best the internet has to offer for the week of March 19, 2017. The white supremacists of the have added Jane Austen to the list of cultural signifiers they use to represent an imagined white European paradise, the New York Times reports. (They are also fans of medieval imagery.) Which, as Tom Hawking points out, misses the point of Austen by a fair amount.",
        "BEIJING \u2014 Lucifer does not follow Chinese politics. The musician in Beijing \u2014 who chose his English name \u201cto be different\u201d \u2014 doesn\u2019t read state media. He cannot name any of the standing committees of the Politburo, the seven men who steer the Chinese Communist Party, save for \u201cXi Dada,\u201d a common nickname for Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
        "Rep. Mark Meadows ( ) walked out of a meeting Thursday afternoon with an ultimatum over his head and his health vote uncertain. President Trump had just ordered a vote on his endorsed plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, a bold attempt to break Republican rebels and ram the plan through the House. Meadows led one of the rebel groups, the House Freedom Caucus, and Trump had forced him into a choice: back a bill that Meadows said left too much of Obamacare in place, or shun it and allow the whole law to stand.",
        "The cancellation of the planned House vote on the American Health Care Act Friday is a devastating defeat for President Trump, marking the first major legislative setback of his administration. Yet in some ways, it might also come as a relief to him \u2014 because the Republican health bill, crafted mainly by Speaker Paul Ryan, was hideously unpopular, violated many of Trump\u2019s campaign promises, and would have caused a whole lot of pain to a whole lot of voters if it were ever enacted.",
        "This is it. The battle over the future of US climate policy is officially underway. In a sweeping new executive order, President Trump ordered his Cabinet today to start demolishing a wide array of policies on global warming \u2014 including emissions rules for power plants, limits on methane leaks, a moratorium on federal coal leasing, and the use of the social cost of carbon to guide government actions. Everyone knew this was coming: Trump has said repeatedly that he wants to repeal US climate regulations and unshackle the fossil fuel industry. But Tuesday\u2019s order is only a first step.",
        "ROSWELL, Georgia \u2014 On a sunny Sunday in Karley Barber, 54, spends her morning and afternoon going door to door for Jon Ossoff, the leading Democrat running for the Georgia House seat vacated by former Rep. Tom Price, Donald Trump\u2019s health and human services secretary. Clipboard in hand, she laughs nervously as she marches up the steep gravel path to the first house on her list. She raps twice on the wood door frame, and shivers with a nervous jitter as someone inside approaches. \u201cI\u2019ve never done this!",
        "House Republicans introduced the American Health Care Act on March 6. On March 24 \u2014 just 18 days later \u2014 it was dead. This was a very short debate over a very big policy proposal, one that would have gutted Obamacare\u2019s insurance expansion and left a projected 24 million Americans uninsured.

        "On Friday, the Department of Justice sent letters to a handful of jurisdictions that currently receive federal funding for law enforcement, with what seems like an innocuous request: they have 2 months to \u201cprovide documentation\u201d proving that they\u2019re in full compliance with a federal law about in order to continue qualifying for federal grants in the coming fiscal year. But that uncontroversial request \u2014 asking cities to prove they obey a law that pretty much all of them say they already obey \u2014 is the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to turn up the heat on \u201csanctuary cities.",
        "The Pentagon is reportedly considering ramping up US support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s bloody war in Yemen, which has already killed at least 10, 000, displaced 3 million, and left millions more at risk of famine since it began in March 2015. That would be a major shift from the current US mission there, which has largely focused on using drones and special operations forces to batter \u2019s affiliate in Yemen.",
        "Someone needs to tell House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes to stop digging. Nunes has faced sustained criticism for a bombshell announcement last Wednesday that an unnamed source had given him information that seemed to validate Donald Trump\u2019s baseless wiretapping allegations. Nunes later acknowledged he had no such evidence and apologized for personally briefing top White House officials about the supposed information before speaking to the rest of his committee.",
        "Yuval Noah Harari\u2019s first book, Sapiens, was an international sensation. The Israeli historian\u2019s tour through the triumph of Homo sapiens is a favorite of, among others, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Barack Obama. His new book, Homo Deus: a Brief History of Tomorrow, is about what comes next for humanity \u2014 and the threat our own intelligence and creative capacity poses to our future. I spoke with Harari recently for my podcast, The Ezra Klein Show. To hear our whole conversation, subscribe on iTunes (or wherever you get your podcasts) or stream it off SoundCloud.",
        "It\u2019s tax season again, and that means you\u2019re probably thinking about using TurboTax. You wouldn\u2019t be alone; Intuit, the company that sells TurboTax, claimed last year that the app has 31 million users. Its competitors did pretty well for themselves too, with H&R Block preparing more than 23 million returns last cycle and millions more using TaxAct and TaxSlayer. Let me be blunt: You should not pay for TurboTax. If you want to use a free version of TurboTax or H&R Block at Home or Credit Karma Tax or TaxAct, go nuts.",
        "There is a debate about the reasons for Donald Trump\u2019s populist appeal. Is it about economic angst among the white working class, or is it primarily a cultural backlash? Writers like the Atlantic\u2019s Michelle Cottle worried that \u201cTrumpism has, in part, made the rest of the nation all the more eager to ignore the millions of white voters living on the edges of the economy. \u201d But as my Vox colleague Dylan Matthews noted, \u201cthere is absolutely no evidence that Trump\u2019s supporters, either in the primary or the general election, are disproportionately poor or working class.",
        "Among experts who study energy policy, there\u2019s remarkably widespread agreement that tackling climate change would be easier if we could quickly and cheaply build lots of new nuclear power plants. It\u2019s not always a popular argument, but it\u2019s a compelling one on its face. This paper from Jesse Jenkins and Samuel Thernstrom offers a great overview of the relevant research. Yes, it\u2019s absolutely possible to imagine a grid powered 100 percent by renewables like wind, solar, and hydropower. But it\u2019s also undeniably hard to juggle intermittent sources of electricity.",
        "Americans looking with confusion and shock at the state of our own political system may take solace in the madness happening in South Korea, one of our closest allies, where the country\u2019s former president was just arrested. The bizarre political scandal surrounding former President Park started in late 2016 and ultimately resulted in Park\u2019s impeachment and dismissal from her post earlier this month. It was the first time that a democratically elected president had been removed from office in South Korea. Now Park is also the first democratically elected South Korean leader to be put behind bars.",
        "There comes a time in every administration when Congress brings the president\u2019s ambitions of sweeping legislative change to a screeching halt. For Bill Clinton, it was the failure of his health reform plan in 1994. For George W. Bush, it was the death of Social Security reform in 2005. For Barack Obama, the Senate failed to act on his bill in 2010.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s initial reaction to the news that his plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act wouldn\u2019t pass the House of Representatives was unusual, to say the least. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying for the last year and a half that the best thing we can do, politically speaking,\u201d he argued in a statement to the press delivered in the Oval Office, \u201cis let Obamacare explode. It is exploding now. \u201d Presidents fail to accomplish policy goals all the time. George W. Bush wanted to privatize Social Security. Barack Obama wanted to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility.",
        "At 9 pm on Saturday, Fox News commentator Jeanine Pirro called for House Speaker Paul Ryan to step down from his leadership position after failing to pass a health care bill this week, on her show Justice. Here\u2019s the kicker: Earlier in the day, President Donald Trump told the nation to tune in and watch her say it. The unusual timing sent the internet spinning: Was Trump, an avid Fox News consumer, sending political messages through the network?",
        "Amber Galloway Gallego is one of a growing number of American Sign Language interpreters who specialize in the performing arts. If you frequent music festivals and concerts, you might see her \u2014 or an interpreter like her \u2014 grooving to the music, mirroring the emotions and physicality of the artists onstage, interpreting their imaginative lyrics for who rely on visual accommodations. She\u2019s interpreted for more than 400 artists at this point, and has a special knack for interpreting acts. You might have seen this viral video floating around of her signing alongside Kendrick Lamar\u2019s live performance at Lollapalooza.",
        "Ivanka Trump is refusing to be transparent about her current position at the White House but only two years ago she crafted an entire campaign encouraging women to do the opposite. \u201cRecord yourself saying your extended job title, followed by your name and actual job title,\u201d reads a post on her website, advertising a campaign that encourages women to state all of their roles, even the ones that extend beyond the workplace. \u201cPost the video to your social channels and tag a few of the women who inspire you to encourage them to follow suit.",
        "The House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election is embroiled in yet another controversy. A new report from the Washington Post\u2019s Devlin Barrett and Adam Entous says that Trump administration officials wouldn\u2019t approve former acting Attorney General Sally Yates\u2019s planned testimony before the committee on certain topics, claiming they were \u201clikely covered by the presidential communications privilege.",
        "The American Health Care Act, the Republican bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, suffered a quick and decisive defeat last week, pulled from the House floor before a vote because it couldn\u2019t get enough support to pass. But some members of Congress are already hinting they want to try again. House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters Tuesday that repeal efforts would continue on the Hill. Across the Capitol, many Republican senators appeared undeterred by the House bill\u2019s failure. One suggested the Senate might draft its own bill to accomplish what House Republicans couldn\u2019t.",
        "In a 215 to 205 vote, the House of Representatives has approved legislation to allow internet service providers to sell information about their customers\u2019 web browsing histories to advertisers and other third parties. The legislation has already been passed by the Senate, so it is now headed to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk for his signature.",
        "The ongoing confusion of Donald Trump\u2019s first months as president has presented a unique challenge to anyone who mines the news for comedy, especially now that Trump can\u2019t be written off \u2014 like he was when he officially announced his candidacy in June 2015 \u2014 as a punchline slowly descending an escalator. Namely: How the hell are you supposed to make jokes about news that feels so hyperbolic \u2026 and often disturbing? It\u2019s a question that\u2019s especially relevant to TV, where hosts have been offering sardonic takes on the headlines almost daily for decades.",
        "UPDATE March 29, 1:40 p. m.: According to a press briefing with Interior Secretary Zinke, the formal review of the federal coal leasing program launched by the previous administration has in fact been scrapped (contrary to what the post below anticipated). It is a much more significant change than the lifting of the moratorium. Here\u2019s a post on what it means. In January 2016, the Department of Interior placed a temporary moratorium on the leasing of federal land to private companies for the purposes of coal mining.",
        "It\u2019s easy to get lost among the 15, 000 attendees at AIPAC\u2019s Policy Conference, the lobby group\u2019s massive annual confab held in Washington\u2019s Convention Center. But when you ask their opinion of the Trump administration, there\u2019s one thing they all seem to agree on: Where Israel is concerned, President Trump is a real improvement over President Obama. \u201cYou surely sense that there\u2019s much more of a desire in this administration than the last one to get things done with Israel, our greatest ally,\u201d Uri Kirschner, a real estate attorney in Manhattan, said.",
        "Civilian deaths are surging at an astonishing rate in the fight against ISIS, a tangible sign that the war is growing more dangerous, not less, as Washington and its allies steadily regain territory that had been lost to the group. In part, it reflects a major shift in the fight\u2019s dynamics. Iraqi, Kurdish, and US forces are no longer battling ISIS in remote and sparsely populated parts of the two countries. Instead, the battle has moved to cities like Mosul, where the large civilian populations mean that a single errant airstrike can cause heavy casualties.",
        "If your family looks a bit like Ivanka Trump\u2019s, you might just have a shot at benefiting from the national child care proposal she\u2019s shopping around Congress. But if you\u2019re one of the millions of and parents hoping to catch a break? Don\u2019t count on it. (function() ; if( typeof( pym) === \u2019undefined\u2019) else })(); The New York Times reported that the first daughter has been holding meetings \u201cquietly\u201d (she has no formal role in her father\u2019s administration) to push her trademark issue of boosting opportunities for working women through child care and paid family leave policies.",
        "\u201c[Geert] Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny,\u201d Iowa Rep. Steve King tweeted earlier this month, referring to the Dutch nationalist. \u201cWe can\u2019t restore our civilization with somebody else\u2019s babies. \u201d That\u2019s a lot of racist theory to pack into 140 characters. The tweet evokes a fear of American decline caused both by genetics and culture, nature and nurture."
