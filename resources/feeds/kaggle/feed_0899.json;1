        "On Tuesday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order rolling back a number of policies put in place by the Obama administration to combat climate change. As Vox\u2019s Brad Plumer explained in detail, the order includes these key instructions to the federal government: Start rolling back the Clean Power Plan. Reconsider carbon standards for new coal plants. Reconsider regulations on methane emissions from oil and gas operations. Revisit the \u201csocial cost of carbon\u201d estimate used to justify climate regulations. Lift the moratorium on federal coal leasing. Repeal guidance for factoring climate change into National Environmental Policy Act reviews.",
        "Lately, we\u2019ve heard a lot about Obamacare \u201cexploding\u201d from members of the GOP, including President Donald Trump. But Obamacare, with its thousands of provisions, isn\u2019t going anywhere short of a full repeal. Most at risk for now, however, are the Obamacare exchanges created to help some 13 million Americans buy quality and affordable insurance outside of the market. And the overwhelming majority of these people happen to live in rural parts of the country \u2014 the very same places that voted for Donald Trump.",
        "The Kansas legislature has voted in favor of a bill to expand the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion \u2014 a move that would extend Obamacare\u2019s footprint just days after the Congress\u2019s failed attempt to repeal the law. The Kansas House passed the Medicaid expansion bill in February. Late Monday, the Kansas Senate voted to expand Medicaid in an overwhelming vote. The bill will go through one more vote in the Senate. If it passes with the same level of support, it then moves to the desk of Republican Gov. Sam Brownback.",
        "Jared Kushner has been tasked with helping the federal government solve some of America\u2019s most vexing public policy crises \u2014 from streamlining Veterans Affairs to fixing the opioid epidemic \u2014 by bringing the acumen of the business world to the White House. On Monday, President Donald Trump announced that he\u2019d tapped his to lead the newly formed \u201cWhite House Office of American Innovation. \u201d Its charges include fulfilling key Trump campaign pledges like \u201cfighting the opioid crisis\u201d and \u201creforming care for veterans,\u201d according to the Washington Post. Kushner has never held government office before taking this post.",
        "Mired in scandal over possible political ties to Russia, President Donald Trump took to Twitter Monday night to turn the blame to his former political adversary Hillary Clinton. Rattling off a list of the Clintons\u2019 ties to Russia, Trump raised a widely debunked allegation that Clinton personally profited from a 2009 Uranium deal with Russia during the State Department\u2019s \u201creset\u201d campaign to soften relations with the country. Why isn\u2019t the House Intelligence Committee looking into the Bill & Hillary deal that allowed big Uranium to go to Russia, Russian speech. ... \u2014 Donald J.",
        "In his daily press briefing on Monday, White House spokesperson Sean Spicer suggested that President Trump canceled a vote on the Republican plan to replace Obamacare because it was a \u201cbad deal\u201d that was \u201cnot going to be keeping with the vision that he had. \u201d But Trump was trying to get House Republicans to vote for the bill until the very last minute, even though it never lived up to his promises on the campaign trail to cover everyone and do it cheaply.",
        "Shortly after taking office, Donald Trump announced the United States\u2019 official withdrawal from the Trans Pacific Partnership. As a matter of substance, it was meaningless \u2014 the agreement had been dead for months. But it stood as a symbol of and a down payment on Trump\u2019s promise of a larger revision in American trade policy. Instead, Trump has given us, so far, exactly the trade policy that Hillary Clinton promised. On trade, exactly nothing has happened. The TPP is still dead, but NAFTA is very much still with us.",
        "The term \u201cpopulism\u201d is often used but rarely understood. In the 2016 presidential election, populism became a catchall to describe both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. Populism was a phenomenon and a phenomenon. It\u2019s also been used to describe some of the movements sweeping across Europe. As recently as last month, writers like the Atlantic\u2019s Uri Friedman have described populism as a \u201cthin ideology. \u201d But how can populism conform to any ideological framework and still apply to such an array of movements and people?",
        "With support from Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and the legislature, North Carolina on Thursday passed what supporters brandished as a \u201crepeal\u201d of HB2, the state\u2019s law. But LGBTQ advocates are furious, arguing that the deal falls far short of the full repeal they were hoping for. To understand why, let\u2019s back up. HB2 had two major parts: It overturned and banned local statutes that protect LGBTQ people from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.",
        "It was a fall day in 2014, and my classroom was full of excitement. My students had transformed themselves into historical figures for a living history project. I was going to broadcast it online so other schools could watch our \u201cAge of Exploration News Conference\u201d live. One half of the class researched and dressed up as European explorers like Christopher Columbus. The other half acted as news reporters from all the major outlets ready with questions. It was my attempt to bring history to life. Andy stepped to the mic. Several classes from across America were watching live online.",
        "Republican leaders have been complaining for years about the Freedom Caucus, the group of House members who live to annoy the party brass. But they\u2019ve never taken a shot so public, vocal, and direct as what Donald Trump tweeted today \u2014 basically calling Freedom Caucus members electoral enemies on a par with the Democratic Party. The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don\u2019t get on the team, & fast. We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018! \u2014 Donald J.",
        "If you want to keep up with the future of Obamacare, you\u2019d be better served following the news from Topeka, Kansas, than the news out of Washington. This is not a joke! My favorite news publications right now are the Kansas City Star and the Lawrence . Both are covering the twists and turns of the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion battle. That, and not the Washington debate over Obamacare repeal, is the key health policy fight to watch right now. Republican efforts on Obamacare repeal are stalled. There is no plan that can get enough support to move through Congress.",
        "During the 2016 campaign, Donald Trump broke every rule of politics \u2014 and he won anyway. He dominated the Republican primary by running against the Republican Party. He repulsed the GOP\u2019s key leaders and emerged all the stronger for it. He delighted in conspiracy theories and schoolyard insults. He contradicted himself routinely, but managed to sell his as evidence of pragmatism rather than proof of dishonesty. He knew nothing about policy, didn\u2019t bother to learn more, and profited from the uncertainty about his true positions.",
        "A couple of times a day, every day, I consider whether life is worth it. An action or an inaction \u2014 some monumental and some minuscule \u2014 an observation, or sometimes a realization causes me to consider the world, my place in it, and whether or not I even want one. I call it my daily internal dialogue about suicide. I don\u2019t ever like having these conversations. But there are other people out there who may feel this way and think they\u2019re alone, and my story may help. Some 9. 3 million American adults (3.",
        "Spoiler: This article deals with the plot of the entire season of Legion and touches on what happened in its season finale. Legion\u2019s season finale marks the end of one of the most challenging \u2014 and best \u2014 superhero shows in recent memory. In a genre cluttered with shows that bleed into one another, Legion stood out emphatically. Looking at any given scene from Legion, it would be impossible to mistake it for any other show.",
        "The Hate U Give is a didactic issues novel for teenagers. It is also a good book. Those two categories intersect only rarely, but The Hate U Give \u2014 a debut novel by Angie Thomas \u2014 manages the balancing act with aplomb. Rating Starr grew up in a poor black neighborhood, but after she saw her best friend gunned down in a gang shooting when she was 10, her parents sent her off to a wealthy white private school.",
        "The new Republican Congress hasn\u2019t gotten much done in its first three months, but one thing it has accomplished is rolling back internet privacy regulations passed in the waning days of the Obama administration. The regulations, if they had gone into effect, would have prohibited internet service providers from selling information about your online activities to advertisers. But yesterday the House of Representatives blocked the move. Companion legislation has already passed the Senate, and President Donald Trump is expected to sign the bill. That has sparked a backlash from Democrats and many privacy advocates.",
        "It\u2019s official: The United Kingdom is leaving the European Union. On Wednesday, UK Prime Minister Theresa May submitted notice to the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, that her country would be departing his union under Article 50 of the EU\u2019s Lisbon Treaty. This marks the formal beginning of EU and UK negotiations over what the British and EU relationship will look like after Britain leaves. If the negotiations don\u2019t produce any agreement, then the UK will simply be kicked out of all EU agreements \u2014 including, most notably, the EU\u2019s internal free trade and free migration agreements.",
        "The US tax code is definitely complicated at points, so it\u2019s no wonder that the claim that it is 70, 000 pages long has become a widely cited factoid, most recently in messaging from Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee, the committee that\u2019s leading the Republican effort to simplify and reform income taxes: The tax code has nearly tripled in length over the last 30yrs. Americans deserve a simpler, fairer, and flatter codehttps: . pic. twitter. \u2014 Ways and Means (@WaysandMeansGOP) March 29, 2017 The only problem with this claim is that it\u2019s clearly false.",
        "President Donald Trump wants to do something about the opioid epidemic. It\u2019s just not clear what, exactly, he\u2019ll do. Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order to deal with the opioid epidemic. It doesn\u2019t take any specific actions against the epidemic. But it creates a commission, to be headed by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, that will decide what can be done. The President\u2019s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis will focus on putting together a report, due in the fall, on the opioid crisis and potential solutions to it.",
        "If you\u2019re the Republican chair of the House panel charged with leading the growing investigation into President Trump\u2019s wiretapping allegations, it isn\u2019t a good sign when a leading senator from your own party says you\u2019ve lost all credibility and mockingly compares you to Inspector Clouseau. It\u2019s also not a good sign when the top Democrat on your committee accuses you of doing the White House\u2019s bidding and demands that you recuse yourself from the probe. Or when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says you\u2019ve tarnished your office.",
        "President Donald Trump signed his executive order on \u201cenergy independence\u201d yesterday. It was a sprawling mess \u2014 a laundry list of Obama policies Trump wants to \u201csuspend, revise, or rescind. \u201d If you want to know the details of what it does, read Brad Plumer\u2019s explainer. Before it is overshadowed by the next Trump outrage, I want to take a step back and try to get some perspective on what it tells us about Trump\u2019s administration, and what it means for climate change.",
        "Today\u2019s release of the Samsung Galaxy S8 today is highly anticipated, but it should also be fairly routine, as Samsung has released seven previous models of the flagship Galaxy S smartphone line. But these are not ordinary circumstances. Samsung is still recovering after exploding Galaxy Note 7 phones damaged Samsung\u2019s brand last fall. And the company is facing growing competition both from the high end of the market \u2014 especially Google\u2019s Pixel phone \u2014 and from Chinese phone makers. So the launch of the S8 is a fairly moment for Samsung.",
        "One of the biggest mysteries in the strange case of Rep. Devin Nunes, the House Intelligence Committee chair who\u2019s trying \u2014 and failing \u2014 to substantiate President Trump\u2019s wiretapping claims, may have just have been solved. In a bombshell report Thursday, the New York Times named the sources who provided Nunes with classified intelligence reports purportedly validating some of Trump\u2019s wiretapping claims \u2014 and both of them are Trump administration political appointees working directly in the White House complex.",
        "Republicans have two ways to move forward on health care reform, and House Speaker Paul Ryan and President Donald Trump can\u2019t seem to agree on which one to go with. Ryan shot down Trump\u2019s idea of working with Democrats to push through health care reform in an interview with CBS, which aired Thursday. \u201dI don\u2019t want that to happen,\u201d he said, referring to the president\u2019s claim that the \u201cthe Democrats will make a deal\u201d with him after Obamacare spirals out. The Democrats will make a deal with me on healthcare as soon as ObamaCare folds not long.",
        "House Republicans just passed two bills that will make it harder for the Environmental Protection Agency to use scientific research to protect health and the environment. And they\u2019ve done so under the deceptive guise of \u201ctransparency. \u201d Over the past two days, the House has passed the \u201cHONEST Act\u201d and the \u201cEPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act. \u201d On the surface, they seem noble. They use the same language scientists use when advocating for stronger research practices. But they\u2019re \u201cwolf in sheep\u2019s clothing types of statutes,\u201d says Sarah Lamdan, a law professor who studies environmental information access at CUNY.",
        "a stunning new podcast hosted by This American Life producer Brian Reed and produced by the creative team behind Serial, is brilliant, complicated, frequently troubling, and often painfully beautiful. I\u2019m not convinced it should have been made. The first few episodes of the series comprise a baffling, rapidly expanding set of mini stories, involving one narrative twist after another about murder, mental health, impending societal collapse, and clocks. But they almost serve as misdirection away from a larger, more central thread. Indeed, it\u2019s not until episode four of seven that \u2019s theme finally articulates itself.",
        "Twitter just rolled out one of the most important changes the social networking site has ever made to its core product: It is removing usernames from reply tweets, instead showing them outside the body of the tweet. That\u2019s a change from the old system, where replying to a tweet required starting your reply with the recipient\u2019s username. Under the new system, these usernames won\u2019t count against the limit. Anytime a major social media platform makes even minor changes, it generates consternation.",
        "Bullshitting is easy, but governing is hard: Trump\u2019s bluster and bombast, so effective on the campaign trail, has backfired spectacularly in office. As Vox\u2019s Ezra Klein noted this week, Trump is failing on almost every front. His health care bill died \u2014 killed by his own party. His approval rating has sunk to 35 percent. His executive orders banning immigrants from seven countries were struck down by the courts. investigations are undermining his agenda. And his administration, plagued by leaks, remains divided.",
        "When horrible news breaks \u2014 like the 2015 Paris attack, or Robin Williams\u2019s suicide \u2014 crisis counseling services often get a deluge of calls from people dealing with despair. Deciding whom to help first can be a decision. At the Crisis Text Line, a text messaging \u2014 based crisis counseling hotline, these deluges have the potential to overwhelm the human staff. Nowadays data scientists at Crisis Text Line are using machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence, to pull out the words and emojis that signal a person at higher risk of suicide ideation or ."
