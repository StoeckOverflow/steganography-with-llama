        "I wasn\u2019t planning to write about Harlots. But then I ended up watching two episodes in a row and found myself thinking things like, \u201cI\u2019d rather work in the rowdy cathouse than the stuffy brothel,\u201d and, \u201cI could definitely run a smoother virginity auction than that fiasco at the opera,\u201d so here we are. Hulu\u2019s new period drama \u2014 produced in conjunction with the UK\u2019s ITV \u2014 tells the story of the ongoing turf war between two London brothels.",
        "The failure of Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare doesn\u2019t just preserve insurance coverage for the 22 million or so people who have gained coverage under the legislation. It could mean that millions more will gain coverage in the future. That\u2019s because 18 states have still refused to adopt the Medicaid expansion included in the legislation. Doing so would expand Medicaid to 4. 5 million people in those states alone, and at least 90 percent of the costs would be borne by the federal government.",
        "Last week we shared the first three speakers for our next Vox Conversations unconference series, and we\u2019re now thrilled to announce the full lineup joining us on April 26 and 27. Vox Conversations is our semiannual unconference series that takes place in Washington, DC. Over two days, we assemble 200 thinkers and doers, representing the worlds of government, health care, technology, academia, media, and more, to participate in and sessions designed to encourage meaningful dialogue and new ideas.",
        "The 2017 African Global Economic & Development Summit, put together by a firm called the Global Green Development Group and hosted on the University of Southern California campus, took place in earlier this month. No one from Africa attended. About 100 people were slotted to come to the conference from Africa \u2014 from filmmakers to government officials, from Guinea to Ethiopia to South Africa. But all of their visas to come to the US for business travel were rejected. Every. Single. One.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t work with women. If they\u2019re attractive, I\u2019m too tempted. And if they\u2019re not attractive, what\u2019s the point?\u201d A male partner at a law firm casually made this pronouncement one day at lunch, hardly looking up from his plate. Everyone laughed and went back to eating \u2014 in the world of DC law, it wasn\u2019t even the most obnoxious thing said that day. But this is no laughing matter for the women whose career opportunities are impeded by men who cavalierly dismiss half of the labor force and insist that they\u2019ve behaved honorably by doing so.",
        "\u201cGeneral Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it. \u201d So begins a Thursday statement from former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s attorney, Robert Kelner, about his client\u2019s willingness to testify before the House and Senate intelligence committees in exchange for immunity from prosecution. The implication is that Flynn has vital information about the ties between Trump and Russia, and that he did some questionable stuff while working for the Trump team.",
        "Atlanta\u2019s road problems seem to be multiplying. In late March, a massive fire under an elevated section of one of the city\u2019s major highways, caused a portion of the road to collapse. Monday morning saw the temporary shutdown of two additional sections of highway: An accident involving an SUV and a caused a chemical spill that closed the city\u2019s downtown connector for several hours; then around 11:30 am, a section of Interstate 20 buckled because of an underground gas leak, causing ongoing westbound lane closures. Reports have indicated that the incidents involved some injuries.",
        "After years of abhorrent conditions and abuses, New York City will shut down the notoriously troubled Rikers Island jail. \u201cNew York City will close the Rikers Island jail facility,\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Friday. \u201cIt will take many years. It will take many tough decisions along the way. But it will happen. \u201d The details of what will come to replace Rikers Island are still unclear. As the New York Times reported, a commission previously recommended that the jail be broken up into smaller jails located in each of the city\u2019s five boroughs.",
        "In an appealing but weird TV coincidence, A&E\u2019s Duck Dynasty and HBO\u2019s Girls \u2014 which debuted in March and April 2012, respectively \u2014 ended their respective runs in satisfying parallel, on March 29 and April 16, 2017. Related Girls\u2019 series finale wasn\u2019t satisfying, but it was fitting The two series were diametrically opposed in everything from viewership to media attention. Duck Dynasty, at its height, commanded more than 10 million viewers for broadcasts, while Girls was lucky to break 1 million.",
        "The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday night that former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has been seeking an immunity deal from both the FBI and the House and Senate intelligence committees under which he would testify in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Shortly thereafter, Flynn\u2019s attorney, Robert Kelner, released a letter to the press that appeared to confirm the story. \u201cGeneral Flynn certainly has a story to tell,\u201d according to the letter, \u201cand he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit.",
        "To look at the list of shows leaving Netflix, April 2017 is going to be a bloodbath. Buffy is leaving. Scratch that \u2014 the complete TV works of Joss Whedon are leaving (save Dollhouse, season two). Better Off Ted is leaving. Ally McBeal is leaving. The is leaving. Go through that list, though, and you\u2019ll see that most of the shows leaving the service have one thing in common: They\u2019re 20th Century Fox productions.",
        "Several years ago, a male colleague and I left a meeting on one side of campus at the university where we both teach to return to our offices, a walk away. Since I had driven my car to the meeting, I asked my colleague if he\u2019d like a ride back. After an almost imperceptible hesitation, he politely thanked me and said no.",
        "We\u2019ll level with you: April 2017 is absolutely stacked with new streaming options, to the point where the committed viewer could get away with not leaving the house for the entire month. There\u2019s a true bounty, featuring hotly anticipated original TV series, intriguing new documentaries, underseen recent classics, and some of the best films of last year.",
        "Sherri Underwood reluctantly cast her vote for Donald Trump in November. But as her health insurance premiums continued to rise, reaching a price higher than her mortgage, she decided to vote for Trump with the hope that he would repeal and replace Obamacare. She wasn\u2019t alone: Health care was one of the top reasons that voters chose Trump in the 2016 election. A Pew study shows the issue was one of the five most important issues for Americans. Many Trump voters expressed frustration with high premiums and the penalty tax of Obamacare.",
        "Since the election, the science community has been grappling with a bleak question: Would Donald Trump \u2014 occasional climate change denier, flirt, and conspiracy theorist \u2014 be the \u201cmost \u201d president we\u2019ve ever had? This week, we got a better sense of what his science policy is going to look like. The series of actions that unfolded reveal an administration, and a Congress, with little regard for scientific consensus and expertise swinging at President Obama\u2019s environmental legacy. Here\u2019s a recap.",
        "House Republicans haven\u2019t just failed to repeal Obamacare \u2014 their attempts to do so seem to have also caused the law\u2019s popularity to skyrocket, making the path to future repeal even tougher to achieve. A new poll released on Friday by found support for Obamacare repeal plummeting, particularly among Republicans. In just one month, the number of Republican voters who want the law abolished dropped from 68 percent to 57 percent \u2014 an swing.",
        "Every weekend, we pick a movie you can stream that dovetails with current events. Old, new, blockbuster, arthouse: They\u2019re all fair game. What you can count on is a weekend watch that sheds new light on the week that was. The movie of the week for April 1 through 7 is The Social Network (2010) which is available to digitally rent on Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, YouTube, and Vudu.",
        "This week, Roxane Gay \u2014 feminist writer, editor, and professor of English at Purdue University \u2014 answers our questions. What\u2019s the first piece of media you consume every day? Twitter. Name a writer or publication you disagree with but still read. The American Conservative. Who is the person who has most influenced the way you think? My mother. When was the last time you changed your mind about something? In my early 30s, I changed my mind about feminism. What\u2019s your worst intellectual habit? Procrastination. What inspires you to learn?",
        "All politicians discuss their policies in terms meant to appeal to a target audience. When it\u2019s done well and honestly, we call it powerful rhetoric. When it\u2019s more tendentious and inelegant, we call it spin. And when it reaches a point where the language and the policy are completely at odds, we call it Orwellian, after George Orwell\u2019s 1984 and the totalitarian Ministry of Truth it depicted. \u201cWar is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength. \u201d But Orwellian language only sounds chilling coming from a regime able to enforce obedience.",
        "The crackdown on opioid prescriptions to rein in the raging epidemic of opioid abuse and overdoses is picking up steam. Ten states have passed legislation that limits new opioid prescriptions to 10 days or less (in line with 2016 Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention guidelines) and more states are likely to follow suit. This week, President Trump signed an executive order that would create a commission to review various strategies to prevent addiction.",
        "For such a massive, conflict, World War II boasts a surprising amount of film documentation. Some moments were staged by necessity (the light was wrong, or something hadn\u2019t been captured quite right) and a few real events were even recreated on soundstages. But filming many of those moments required work from directors who had never made documentaries before. And these directors weren\u2019t \u2014 they included some of the biggest names in Hollywood at the time. Yet less attention has been paid to the men behind those cameras than you might expect, given Hollywood\u2019s constant stream of .",
        "Welcome back to Vox\u2019s Saturday book link roundup, a curated collection of the week\u2019s best writing on books and related subjects. Here is the best the internet has to offer for the week of March 26, 2017. You might remember that we talked to Timothy Snyder about his new book, On Tyranny, a few weeks ago. A fake book with the same title just popped up on Amazon, apparently to direct sales traffic away from Snyder\u2019s book, and the Guardian reports that the fake book appears to have been created in Russia.",
        "This the second post in a series on the 100th anniversary of Jeannette Rankin\u2019s induction into the US House of Representatives. Passing the statue of Rep. Jeanette Rankin in the US Capitol recently, a student remarked how weird it was that a woman had served in Congress before women had the right to vote. It\u2019s weird, but also not: Women have been far more prominent in American politics throughout history than conventional wisdom might suggest. As we mark the centennial of Rep.",
        "When a book gets adapted into a movie or a TV show, it used to be fashionable to say, knowingly, \u201cOf course the book was much better \u2014 just a lot more nuanced, you know?\u201d But over the past few years, there\u2019s been a slew of YA novels that have been adapted into pretty good TV: first Pretty Little Liars, then The Vampire Diaries, then The 100.",
        "Every Sunday, we pick a new episode of the week. It could be good. It could be bad. It will always be interesting. You can read the archives here. The episode of the week for March 26 through April 1 is \u201cRichard Youngsta,\u201d the 19th episode of the third season of ABC\u2019s . This week, tackled some of the themes it tackles best: the importance of seeing yourself represented in popular culture, the sword of having to be a \u201cmodel minority,\u201d and the complex web of expectations that comes with being anything other than white.",
        "The Senate voted to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court Friday \u2014 though they couldn\u2019t have done it without triggering the \u201cnuclear option\u201d the day before, which allowed his nomination to advance with a simple majority. That\u2019s because, on Thursday, Democrats voted to filibuster Gorsuch\u2019s nomination, and Republicans couldn\u2019t come up with the necessary 60 votes to overcome that filibuster. If Senate rules were adhered to, Gorsuch\u2019s nomination would have been blocked right there.",
        "Here\u2019s one thing we learned from the Trump administration\u2019s financial disclosures: If conflicts of interests were seeds, the administration would be a kiwi. It\u2019s always relevant to understand the personal financial interests of White House influentials, who\u2019ll be instrumental in making national economic policy. It\u2019s especially important in this administration. Without tax returns, a lot of President Trump\u2019s finances are still a mystery. As of Friday, though, there are more clues about the possible conflicts his top staffers could face \u2014 and there are a lot of them.",
        "George Washington set in motion a strategy so radical that it made this country the wealthiest and strongest on Earth \u2014 it made America great. Immigration. He embraced a vision for an open America that could almost be read today as a form of deep idealism or altruism. \u201cAmerica is open to receive not only the opulent and respectable stranger, but the oppressed and persecuted of all nations and religions,\u201d he told newly arrived Irishmen in 1783.",
        "Britain just kinda, sorta, maybe threatened to go to war with Spain. After Britain\u2019s stunning Brexit vote last summer, the 30, 000 or so residents of the tiny British territory of Gibraltar voted overwhelmingly to remain in the European Union, with 95. 9 percent casting their ballots to stay in the EU. Shortly after the vote results were announced, Madrid \u2014 which has long believed that the territory rightfully belongs to Spain \u2014 called for joint sovereignty over Gibraltar. That hasn\u2019t played well with British politicians \u2014 and some are now publicly threatening actual war with Spain.",
        "After just three months, Donald Trump\u2019s presidency certainly looks like a disaster for climate policy. Trump has filled his administration with climate deniers, plans to disembowel the Environmental Protection Agency, and signed a big executive order to tear up President Obama\u2019s regulations on greenhouse gases. It all seems staggeringly consequential. Lately, however, some liberals and environmentalists have taken a surprisingly sanguine view of these moves, arguing that Trump probably can\u2019t do too much climate damage. Obama\u2019s policies aren\u2019t easy to unwind, after all. Coal is declining no matter what Trump does. Wind and solar are growing regardless."
