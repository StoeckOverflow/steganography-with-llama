        "Egyptian President Abdel Fattah the brutal military dictator who overthrew his country\u2019s democratically elected president in a 2013 coup, killed more than 800 protesters in a single day, and has imprisoned tens of thousands of dissidents since he took power, was President Donald Trump\u2019s honored guest at the White House on Monday. This is Sisi\u2019s first official state visit to Washington as Egypt\u2019s president.",
        "While Republican leaders try again to piece together votes to repeal Obamacare in the House, the party\u2019s moderate wing is looking leftward \u2014 trying to work with centrist Democrats toward a series of health care compromises, according to interviews with four members of Congress. Since the repeal bill championed by House Speaker Paul Ryan failed to garner enough Republican support to pass the House last month, some members of the \u201cNew Democrats\u201d caucus have resumed health care talks with members of the Republican \u201cTuesday Group.",
        "It\u2019s hard to tell at a glance, but Gudetama is an egg yolk with a butt crack. It\u2019s a fictional character of sorts, one with limbs but no fingers or toes. It has a mouth but no obvious teeth. It has thighs but no visible joints, a head but no neck. Its eyes look like sesame seeds. It has no gender. To the naked eye, it could easily be mistaken for a golden bean, a kernel of corn, or an unappealing drop of honey.",

        "This article discusses the season finale of Big Little Lies, \u201cYou Get What You Need,\u201d and contains major spoilers. \u201cYou Get What You Need,\u201d the seventh and final installment of HBO\u2019s Big Little Lies miniseries, is profoundly gripping, arguably one of the most engrossing and uncomfortable TV episodes of this young year. The hour was designed to scare you, to gnaw at your emotions, to keep you in a heightened, tense state; after watching it, I was emotionally spent. As it turns out, all of Big Little Lies\u2019 mysteries revolved around Perry.",
        "In a spectacular display of acting talent and the most gorgeously filmed elementary school fundraiser possibly ever, HBO\u2019s Big Little Lies aired its gripping final episode on April 2 \u2014 or did it? \u201cYou Get What You Need\u201d has (rightfully) received stellar reviews across the board for how well it wrapped up seven episodes\u2019 worth of dark and tangled suburban webs.",

        "It\u2019s clear there was once a pulsing intelligence beneath Ghost in the Shell\u2019s shiny exterior \u2014 some kind of idea it was trying to explore in a complex, engaging story drawing on cyberpunk tradition. But now, it\u2019s an expensive, flashy Hollywood movie, intended to appeal to fans of the manga and anime originals as well as a global audience that\u2019s never read or watched those originals (and to launch a studio franchise, naturally).",
        "Many Americans \u2014 especially women \u2014 are working more hours than they did three decades ago. But they\u2019re not seeing a corresponding growth in wages. A new analysis from the Economic Policy Institute compared wages and hours from 1979 and 2015 to show that most workers saw increases in the amount of time they had to work to make the same amount of money. \u201cPeople are working more of the year,\u201d Valerie Wilson, director at EPI\u2019s Program on Race, Ethnicity, and the Economy, said.",
        "The first few months of the Trump administration have been a goldmine for comedians and political satirists. Shows like Full Frontal With Samantha Bee, Saturday Night Live, and Late Night With Seth Meyers have enjoyed ratings boosts thanks to their regular lampooning of the Trump White House. But beyond the jokes and sight gags, political satirists have done an excellent job of seriously covering the Trump administration \u2014 sometimes even better than major TV news networks.",
        "Senate Democrats have the 41 votes they need to filibuster Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch. On Monday afternoon, Sen. Chris Coons ( ) told reporters that he would be joining the Democratic filibuster against Gorsuch\u2019s nomination. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( ) has said he would respond to a filibuster by rewriting the Senate\u2019s rules so that Supreme Court justices need 51 rather than 60 votes to be confirmed. That rule change \u2014 called the \u201cnuclear option\u201d on Capitol Hill \u2014 would allow Gorsuch to be confirmed without Democratic votes.",
        "RALEIGH, North Carolina \u2014 Sarah Gillooly, policy director for the American Civil Liberties Union North Carolina, waited outside the room where the Senate Rules Committee meets. It was Thursday, and the Rules Committee was scheduled to vote on a repeal of House Bill 2, North Carolina\u2019s infamous \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d based on terms negotiated by Republican and Democratic leaders the night before.

In February, his briefings \u2014 which are carried live by cable news networks \u2014 garnered an average of 4. 3 million viewers, surpassing the viewership of many daytime soap operas.

        "Less than a year after it happened, the Tulsa, Oklahoma, police officer who shot and killed Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man, is speaking out in public. The interview with 60 Minutes doesn\u2019t add much to what we already know about the case, but it does contain one particularly alarming line from Betty Shelby, the officer. \u201cIf I wait to find out if he had a gun or not, I could very well be dead,\u201d Shelby claimed. Then the key sentence: \u201cThere\u2019s something that we always say: \u2018I\u2019d rather be tried by 12 than carried by six.",
        "If you currently have any free time to speak of, prepare for it to be sucked up by the gaping and undeniably magnetic black hole that is television. April is a particularly packed month for TV, and not just any old TV.

        "Donald Trump is the president of the United States, and has information from some of the world\u2019s most powerful intelligence agencies at his disposal. And instead of asking them what\u2019s going on in the world, he\u2019s telling them to watch Fox News. On Monday morning, Trump sent a tweet referring to a recent Fox News report about surveillance of his associates discussed that morning on Fox & Friends \u2014 and tagged it \u201c@FBI,\u201d apparently indicating he wants the FBI to, I guess, look into it? .",
        "A massive explosion tore through a packed commuter train in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Monday, killing 14 people, wounding over 50 more, and raising immediate fears that the country \u2014 which has lost hundreds of people to Islamist terror attacks in recent years \u2014 may have just been hit again.

        "Days ahead of a pivotal meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, President Donald Trump used a weekend interview to send him a blunt message: The US is prepared to act on its own if Beijing doesn\u2019t do more to rein in North Korea. In an interview with the Financial Times on Sunday, Trump repeatedly drove home the point that the threat posed by North Korea\u2019s rapidly growing nuclear program is dire enough that the US will move unilaterally if China isn\u2019t willing to apply more pressure to Pyongyang to halt its activities. \u201cChina has great influence over North Korea.",
        "Last Week Tonight host John Oliver had a surprising anecdote for just how far marijuana legalization has come in the US. \u201cThere is now a Cannabis Caucus in DC, and it\u2019s by these four narcs,\u201d Oliver said, pointing to a picture of four congressmen. \u201cAnd if even an Republican from Alaska,\u201d Oliver said, referring to Rep.

        "Talking about FX\u2019s new drama Feud has become synonymous with gushing about Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon, who play Joan Crawford and Bette Davis with such biting relish that it\u2019s hard to take your eyes off them. But the fact that Feud is such a sumptuous TV treat is just as much thanks to the people behind the scenes, the ones making 1963 Hollywood come to life \u2014 especially the show\u2019s production designer, Judy Becker. The production designer is a crucial position on any television or film set.",
        "With the debacle of health care reform in the rearview window, conservatives in Congress and the White House are turning their sights on President Barack Obama\u2019s financial regulations. All indications are that the GOP is more unified in how they want to go about \u201crepealing and replacing\u201d these regulations \u2014 most of which were passed as part of the Act in 2010. For the past six years, these reforms have provided key protections to consumers and stability to the banking system by protecting consumers.

        "In the barrage of news surrounding President Donald Trump, one of the things his administration quietly did over the past few months was reopen the federal prison system to private prison companies. Some members of Congress, however, have noticed \u2014 and they want the Trump administration to explain itself. On Monday, Sens. Chris Van Hollen ( ) and Cory Booker ( ) will send a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions asking that the Justice Department explain why it reversed the Obama administration\u2019s decision to stop contracting with some private prison operators.",
        "The Walking Dead\u2019s seventh season has often felt like an endless slog through a quagmire, where even the zombies are too stuck to do much more than moan. If there\u2019s been a theme for this season, it\u2019s arguably been ambivalence and indecision. Yet a full season of characters being unsure what choices to make \u2014 and talking about their indecisiveness a lot \u2014 has resulted in a final burst of activity in the season finale, \u201cThe First Day of the Rest of Your Life. \u201d Spoilers for The Walking Dead finale follow.",

The new trailer floated up nearly 200 million views in its first 24 hours, smashing a world record for trailer traffic previously held by Fate of the Furious.

        "Multiple sources tell me that former Obama adviser Zeke Emanuel was at the White House Thursday, meeting with staff about what comes next on health care. I\u2019m told the meeting included a discussion of funding for reinsurance \u2014 one of the programs that protects insurers against exceptionally large financial losses if they have a handful of really medical claims to pay out.
