        "In the past 24 hours, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced both the creation of a settlement in the occupied West Bank (widely reported as the first new, officially sanctioned settlement in 20 years) and promised to curtail settlement activity, in deference to President Donald Trump\u2019s wishes. Netanyahu, in other words, is trying to have it both ways.",
        "Doctor Who is not just returning on April 15 after a lengthy hiatus but returning with a brand new companion for the Doctor \u2014 and as actress Pearl Mackie has now revealed, she\u2019ll be the first openly gay companion since the show premiered 54 years ago. \u201d[Being gay] is not the main thing that defines her character,\u201d Mackie told the BBC of her character, Bill Potts.",
        "Susan Rice, President Obama\u2019s final national security adviser, has all of a sudden become public enemy No. 1 in Trumpworld. In a Wednesday interview with the New York Times, President Trump suggested that she had criminally misused classified information for political purposes. \u201cDo I think [she committed a crime]? Yes, I think,\u201d the president told the Times\u2019 Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman. \u201cIt\u2019s such an important story for our country and the world. It is one of the big stories of our time.",
        "The Trump administration is in talks with congressional Republicans about making another push at repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. The Republicans\u2019 first proposal, the American Health Care Act, failed when the party could not shore up enough support for the bill that would leave 24 million Americans without coverage. The party was split between those who thought AHCA did too much to turn back Obamacare, and those who thought it did not do nearly enough.",
        "When Mike Cernovich, one of the most prominent internet trolls supporting Donald Trump, was interviewed on 60 Minutes, he used the platform to spread conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health and to allege that she is involved with pedophilic sex trafficking operations. But he also declared his belief in health care. \u201dI believe in some form of universal basic income,\u201d he told CBS\u2019s Scott Pelley, citing concerns about technological unemployment. \u201dI\u2019m health care. Is that or is that anymore?",
        "Donald Trump says he is looking for ways to work with Democrats these days. His team has floated the notion of working with the Congressional Black Caucus on infrastructure matters, and told the Financial Times that if the Freedom Caucus remains aloof \u201cwe will make a deal with the Democrats\u201d on health care. There is also a large caucus of protectionist Democrats in Congress who\u2019d be eager on the merits to see Trump fulfill some of his campaign pledges on trade. Yet there\u2019s precious little sign of this strategy happening.",
        "Here\u2019s a frustrating fact for anyone who has been prescribed medication or therapy for depression: Your doctor doesn\u2019t know what treatment will work for you. \u201cIt is currently complete primitive guesswork,\u201d Leanne Maree Williams, a professor at Stanford University, says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine how you can do worse than the current situation, to be honest. \u201d Depression means being stuck in a chronic state of sad mood or lack of enjoyment in life, to a degree where it starts to degrade quality of life.",
        "When New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie discusses his compassionate approach to the ongoing opioid epidemic, he frequently brings up a close friend from law school. He describes this friend as perfect \u2014 incredibly smart, with a successful law practice, with a beautiful and brilliant wife and kids, and both good looking and athletic. \u201cSo we loved him, but we hated him,\u201d Christie joked at a 2015 town hall. \u201cBecause the guy had everything, right?\u201d This friend, however, had a drug problem. Starting with a back injury from running, he was prescribed opioid painkillers.",
        "White House spokesperson Sean Spicer tried to pick another fight with the media on Monday \u2014 and the media fought back. When Spicer called ProPublica, a nonpartisan, nonprofit investigative journalism outlet, a \u201c blog,\u201d the organization took the fight to Twitter. Appropriately for a group that\u2019s known for its reporting, ProPublica showed its receipts. Here\u2019s how the fight started: During Monday\u2019s press briefing, Politico\u2019s Matthew Nussbaum asked Spicer about a ProPublica report from earlier in the day that revealed that President Donald Trump now can withdraw money from his businesses without disclosing it.",
        "\u201cI wish to say \u2014 and I say it without the slightest hesitation \u2014 that if I had my way about it at this hour, I would today build a wall about the United States so high and so secure that not a single alien or foreign refugee from any country upon the face of this earth could possibly scale or ascend it. \u201d But for the slightly antiquated phrasing, those words could have come straight from Donald Trump.",

        "Marvel, the comic book juggernaut known for bringing many iconic superheroes to life, is still figuring out how not to look like a villain. Over the weekend, part of an interview with Marvel vice president David Gabriel made the rounds, in which Gabriel inelegantly and inadvertently suggested that poor sales reflected readers\u2019 disinterest in comic books featuring nonwhite and female superheroes. \u201cWhat we heard was that people didn\u2019t want any more diversity,\u201d Gabriel said in the interview with ICv2. \u201cI don\u2019t know that that\u2019s really true, but that\u2019s what we saw in sales.",

Sign up to get VoxCare in your inbox here. Can a bill be simultaneously dead and alive? Because that\u2019s how the American Health Care Act is looking right now. A week and a half after House Republicans dramatically canceled their vote on the AHCA, it\u2019s now clear that the White House isn\u2019t yet ready to accept defeat and walk away.",
        "After surpassing Ford in value last week, Tesla became the most valuable car company in America Monday as it surged past General Motors. As I write this, Tesla is worth $51 billion, compared with $50 billion for GM and $45 billion for Ford. At first glance, that doesn\u2019t make any sense. Ford sold 6. 6 million vehicles in 2016 and earned $4. 6 billion for the year. GM sold 10 million cars in 2016 and earned $9. 4 billion. Tesla shipped a comparatively tiny 76, 000 vehicles and recorded a loss of $675 million.",
        "The gender pay gap may be narrowing, but those pay increases aren\u2019t happening equally for everyone. White women are making a lot more progress than their black and Hispanic peers, according to data on media hourly wages. Advocates are taking notice of such disparities on Equal Pay Day \u2014 Tuesday, April 4 \u2014 which represents how far into the year women have to work to catch up to the amount men earned in the previous year.",
        "In preparation for the new Ghost in the Shell movie, I recently returned to the 1995 anime film on which it\u2019s based, and I couldn\u2019t help but think of two things: The Matrix, and philosopher Daniel Dennett. The link to The Matrix is obvious enough. Before making that movie, the Wachowskis showed Ghost in the Shell to producer Joel Silver as an example of what they wanted to accomplish with their action sequences. It\u2019s not an adaptation, but The Matrix ended up borrowing heavily from both the structure and visuals of Ghost in the Shell.",
        "A suspected poison gas attack by the Syrian regime on the town of Khan Sheikhoun has killed at least 74 people \u2014 including 16 women and 23 children \u2014 and wounded over 350, according to the Syrian American Medical Society. Videos and photos taken by activists and medics on the scene showed victims choking and fainting, some with foam coming out of their mouths. These videos and photos have not been independently verified.",
        "As the confirmation hearings for Judge Neil Gorsuch were getting underway, the University of Wisconsin philosopher J. Paul Kelleher explored, in Vox, an important aspect of Gorsuch\u2019s view of the world. Gorsuch has praised the late Justice Scalia\u2019s \u201coriginalist\u201d approach to interpreting the Constitution. But he has also been influenced by the concept of \u201cnatural law\u201d \u2014 and even studied under a famous natural law theorist at Oxford.",
        "The Trump administration on Monday announced that it will strip the United Nations Populations Fund (UNFPA) which works on reproductive health, family planning, and infant and maternal mortality in more than 150 countries, of all US funding. The administration claims the organization is in violation of the 1985 Amendment, which forbids US funding of organizations that support or participate in forced sterilizations and abortions. The UNFPA has vigorously denied the charge.",
        "In the months since Donald Trump took office, his administration and its allies have declared the president to be the sole reliable source of truth; presented clear, easily disproven falsehoods as the truth; and suggested that what used to be quaintly called \u201clies\u201d are in fact \u201calternative facts. \u201d Within the same time period, 1984 \u2014 George Orwell\u2019s tale of a dystopian world in which the government declares itself to have a monopoly on the truth \u2014 shot up Amazon\u2019s list. And now, 200 theaters across the world are screening the movie version as a protest against Trump.",
        "LGBTQ advocates aren\u2019t happy with the partial repeal of North Carolina\u2019s law, saying it leaves too much of the old law in place. But on Tuesday, the biggest governing body for college sports said that the \u201crepeal\u201d is good enough. Previously, the NCAA had joined in boycotts of North Carolina in response to HB2, the law, and barred the state from hosting championship games. But the NCAA apparently reconsidered when North Carolina lawmakers last week reached a repeal compromise on HB2 \u2014 barely avoiding the NCAA\u2019s stated deadline before its boycott became permanent.",

        "A new memo by the Trump administration makes it official: The US Department of Justice is putting police reform on hold. The March 31 memo, published by the Washington Post, instructs Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s top two deputies to \u201cimmediately review\u201d reform agreements \u2014 known as \u201cconsent decrees\u201d \u2014 reached with police departments across the country after Justice Department investigations found that these departments routinely violated their residents\u2019 civil rights.",
        "Donald Trump and the broader Republican Party are moving forward on an agenda of business deregulation with a lack of concern for public opinion that, depending on how you look at it, could be seen as reckless, courageous, or horrifying. The latest and clearest example is the bill rolling back efforts by the Federal Communications Commission to prevent cable and telecom companies from secretly selling users\u2019 data. This was, obviously, not a major Trump campaign pledge or a headline feature of any GOP House or Senate candidate\u2019s campaign.",
        "Imagine powering civilization entirely with energy from renewable sources: wind, sun, water (hydroelectricity) naturally occurring heat (geothermal) and plants. No coal mines, oil wells, pipelines, or coal trains. No greenhouse gas emissions, car exhaust, or polluted streams. No wars over oil, dependence on foreign suppliers, or resource shortages. Sounds nice, right? A growing number of activists say it is within reach. The idea has inspired ambitious commitments from an increasing number of cities, including Madison, Wisconsin, San Diego, and Salt Lake City. Advocates are pushing states to support the goal.",
        "Jimmy Fallon\u2019s recurring Lip Sync Battle segment, like most of the party games he hosts on The Tonight Show, has a simple and fundamental appeal: It\u2019s fun to watch people who worked incredibly hard to be good at something bring the same overcommitment to bear on something dumb. What elevates Lip Sync Battle above The Tonight Show\u2019s other games \u2014 for instance, the trivia contest where the winner pours increasingly large amounts of ice down the loser\u2019s pants \u2014 is that it involves a certain amount of performance.",
        "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer appears to have secured support from 40 fellow Democrats for a filibuster of Judge Neil Gorsuch. That marks a victory for Schumer in his bid to block Gorsuch\u2019s nomination. In the long term, though, we think it will prove to be a strategic blunder, making it easier for President Donald Trump to fill a future Supreme Court vacancy with a conservative justice who will swing the balance on issues such as abortion, LGBTQ rights, and affirmative action. The next moves in the parliamentary chess match are predictable.",
        "Prison Break was never a great television show, but it was always agreeably stupid. Its original run, from 2005 to 2009, existed in a weird netherworld between the \u201che\u2019s so smart, he can make a bomb out of a paper clip!\u201d shenanigans of MacGyver and the rowdy antics of The Dukes of Hazzard. (I prefer to watch almost every scene imagining Waylon Jennings pausing the action to drawl, \u201cBoy, them Prison Break boys sure are in a heap o\u2019 trouble!",
        "Hungary\u2019s hardline populist Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n has praised the benefits of \u201cethnic homogeneity,\u201d championed curtailing immigration, and called asylum seekers \u201ca poison. \u201d He is known for criticizing the very idea of liberal democracy and promoting instead a model of what he calls \u201can illiberal state\u201d \u2014 states like Russia and Turkey. But in his recent effort to shut down Budapest\u2019s Central European University, he may have finally gone too far.",
        "Perhaps the best way to describe DC\u2019s Legends of Tomorrow, the weirdest show in The CW\u2019s DC superhero universe, is to let the characters speak for themselves: \u201dThis can\u2019t be happening. They\u2019re not smart enough for this to be happening.\u201d \u2014 Eobard Thawne \u201cWe\u2019ve barely begun, and already this is the worst, unmitigated disaster of my career."
