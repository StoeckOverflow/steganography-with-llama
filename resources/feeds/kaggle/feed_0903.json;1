        "Leaked documents reveal just how President Donald Trump plans to decimate the Environmental Protection Agency and cut 31 percent of its funding. The more detailed vision for the EPA appears in an internal memo by its acting financial officer that was shared with Vox. It includes the elimination of more funding for programs, drastically scaling back different departments within the agency, and more staff layoffs than initially proposed.",
        "More than 20 million people in Somalia, South Sudan, Nigeria, and Yemen currently don\u2019t have access to enough food and water to survive. The United Nations has already officially declared a famine in parts of South Sudan and is warning that if \u201cprompt and sustained humanitarian intervention\u201d doesn\u2019t happen soon, the three other countries could soon cross that threshold as well. Unfortunately, that kind of intervention probably won\u2019t be coming anytime soon. That\u2019s because the primary causes of food insecurity in each of these four countries are ongoing violent conflict and a lack of humanitarian aid funding.",
        "Trey Radel claims to be the first US member of Congress to ever be busted for cocaine possession. That sounds plausible, though it\u2019s impossible to . What\u2019s certain is that Radel, elected in 2012, was a rising star in the Republican Party with a strong libertarian bent until he bought cocaine from an undercover police officer in October 2013. After seeking treatment and attempting to hang on to his seat, he resigned under heavy pressure the following January.",
        "After a North Korean missile test on Tuesday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson released a terse and frankly bizarre statement \u2014 one that confused even dedicated foreign affairs reporters: Uhhhh what does this mean pic. twitter. \u2014 Jessica Schulberg (@jessicaschulb) April 4, 2017 Is the US giving up negotiating with Kim Jong Un? Is it planning to slap new sanctions on Pyongyang? Is it even thinking of some kind of military action against North Korea? So far, the answer has been, \u201cNo, no, and also no.",
        "A quarter of women and 10 percent of men have experienced sexual harassment at work, according to a Washington Post survey. It\u2019s a problem that spans all forms of work, from servers and nursing assistants to panelists on major news networks: The New York Times reported earlier this week that Fox News anchor Bill O\u2019Reilly settled five separate sexual harassment cases over the past two decades. President Donald Trump, himself accused of sexual harassment and assault, even came to O\u2019Reilly\u2019s defense. It\u2019s also a huge problem in work. of workers are women.",
        "The Trumpcare revival is flailing just a few days after it got started. Republican lawmakers left a big meeting on Tuesday night signaling that there had been no great breakthrough on the issues that derailed the American Health Care Act two weeks ago. Another meeting is expected today, though it\u2019s not clear what there is left to do. No new legislative text has been made public.",
        "It was a Thursday morning in Austin, and suddenly ICE was everywhere. A hotline for immigrants \u2014 which typically got a call or two a day \u2014 started fielding a call a minute, overwhelming the volunteers manning the phones. The pleas were vivid: They just took away a member of my family. They just raided my neighbor\u2019s house. They followed him and pulled him over at the side of the road. I saw them in a strip mall parking lot. I saw them down the street. There\u2019s a black SUV, and I think that\u2019s them.",
        "A new Pepsi ad that sparked public outrage is a sign of just how far soda companies are willing to go to appeal to black and Latino youth. The ad features a staged protest filled with beautiful, smiling young people (many of them people of color) and the model Kendall Jenner of the Kardashian clan. Near the end of the almost video, Jenner offers a Pepsi to a handsome young cop, and all is sunny and well in the world.",
        "During a Wednesday press conference, President Trump gave some uncharacteristically harsh comments about Bashar \u2019s government in Syria. The president claimed Assad\u2019s gas attack on Tuesday, which killed at least 74 people, \u201chad a big impact on me,\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s very possible \u2026 that my attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed.",
        "A federal court just unleashed a massive decision in favor of gay rights. In an ruling, the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on Tuesday concluded that federal civil rights law \u2014 specifically, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \u2014 protects workers from discrimination based on sexual orientation. So, the court decided, it\u2019s not legal in the US for an employer to discriminate against gay workers \u2014 making it the first federal appeals court to conclude that gay people are protected under existing civil rights law.",
        "The closest astronomers have come to directly \u201cseeing\u201d a black hole happened last year, when the LIGO observatory detected the gravitational waves radiating from a pair of black holes that collided some 1. 3 billion years ago. That\u2019s cool. But for astronomers, it\u2019s not enough. What\u2019s eluded them is a view of the event horizon, the boundary of the black hole from which, when crossed, there is no return. After the event horizon, gravity is so intense that not even light can escape. We\u2019ve never seen a direct image of a black hole.",

        "You\u2019d be forgiven for assuming that IFC\u2019s new comedy Brockmire would run out of ideas about five minutes in. For starters, it\u2019s based on an online comedy sketch from Funny or Die. Or, to be more precise, it\u2019s based on a funny character type developed by star Hank Azaria over the years and first unveiled by him in that sketch \u2014 a baseball announcer who describes everything in his life as if he\u2019s calling a game. There\u2019s precisely one joke in that premise, and you can probably think of almost every variation on it.",

        "On Tuesday night, Pepsi released a new ad starring Kendall Jenner to the internet. On Wednesday morning, less than 24 hours later, Pepsi pulled the ad from the internet. But I can only imagine that when Pepsi first signed off on the ad, a scene like this played out: INT. PepsiCo, Inc. corporate headquarters \u2014 office of Ron Draper Ron picks up a photograph of Don Draper and gazes into Don\u2019s eyes. RON, whispered: I finally did it, Grandpa. I did it for you.",
        "Last week, Jeff Bezos became the person in the world, with a net worth of $76 billion. If Amazon\u2019s stock continues its meteoric rise, Bezos could soon surpass Bill Gates, whose fortune is worth $83 billion, to become the world\u2019s wealthiest person. Today Amazon is a powerhouse that sells everything from to diapers, so it\u2019s easy to think its rise was inevitable. But Amazon almost didn\u2019t make it. During the boom of the 1990s, the company posted larger and larger losses, financed by investor funds that came pouring in.",
        "Donald Trump often professes to be doing battle with the mainstream media, frequently lambasting it as \u201cfake news\u201d and specifically calling out the \u201cfailing New York Times\u201d by name. But for a clearer view of how Trump actually feels about major media institutions, it\u2019s more useful to look at what he does. For example, he sat down today for an exclusive interview with Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush of the New York Times.",
        "Last week, President Donald Trump declared April National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. This week, he took time in a New York Times interview to defend Bill O\u2019Reilly, a man who has been repeatedly accused of sexual harassment. \u201cI think he\u2019s a person I know well. He is a good person,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think he shouldn\u2019t have settled. Personally, I think he shouldn\u2019t have settled. \u2026 Because you should have taken it all the way. I don\u2019t think Bill did anything wrong.",
        "President Trump\u2019s new national security adviser, Army Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, just made his first big power play: undoing one of the administration\u2019s most controversial decisions by removing White House chief strategist Steve Bannon from the National Security Council. Bannon had been the first White House political adviser ever appointed to the principals committee of the NSC, an exclusive body charged with giving Trump unvarnished advice about literal national security issues. Now Bannon\u2019s short tenure there has come to an end.",
        "New Girl, a show I\u2019ve loved and often cherished as a reliable shot of heartfelt comedy, might be done for good \u2014 and that would be fine by me. If star Jake Johnson\u2019s hints are right, last night\u2019s sixth season finale just may double as New Girl\u2019s series finale. When I first heard that, I was more crushed by the possibility than I thought I\u2019d be (six seasons is a long time, after all).",
        "Sen. Jeff Merkley ( ) left his office in the Hart Office Building around 6 pm Tuesday, walked to the US Capitol, and took to the Senate floor to criticize President Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch. He didn\u2019t leave the floor for another 15 hours and 28 minutes. The Oregon senator didn\u2019t technically filibuster Gorsuch\u2019s nomination: Instead, he used the existing floor time allowed under Senate rules to highlight Democrats\u2019 opposition to Gorsuch, according to an aide.

        "The growing number of allegations about President Trump\u2019s links to Russia sounds really incriminating. But would any of them actually be illegal? As the FBI probes possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Moscow in the to the 2016 election, an array of Trump associates find themselves in the crosshairs of federal and congressional investigators.

        "It\u2019s taken less than two days for President Trump\u2019s Syria policy to go from Bashar can stay to Assad must go. The question now is whether Trump is willing to do something President Obama wouldn\u2019t: use US military force to punish the Syrian dictator for using chemical weapons against his own people. Trump is notoriously hard to predict, but he has told lawmakers he\u2019s actively considering a military response to a suspected sarin gas attack this week in Syria that killed at least 85 people.",
        "The initial spin on White House chief strategist Steve Bannon\u2019s removal from the National Security Council was that nothing was amiss. He had only been there in the first place to keep an eye on the Michael Flynn, senior officials told reporters. Or maybe it was to \u201c \u201d the NSC, whatever that means. Either way, he\u2019s not mad about the demotion; he\u2019s happy about it! A set of soon indicated that the exact opposite was true. Both the New York Times and Politico reported that Bannon was so annoyed about this move that he threatened to quit.",
        "Congress is getting ready to attempt the near impossible: rewrite the tax code for the first time in 31 years. And if there\u2019s one thing to learn from the past effort, it\u2019s that reform will require strong cooperation from both sides of the aisle. The passage of the Tax Reform Act in 1986 was heralded as a triumphant bipartisan effort, one led by President Ronald Reagan. Back then, lawmakers were trying to simplify the tax code and make it more fair, and they focused on lowering the top individual tax rate and eliminating some tax shelters and special deductions."
