        "Legendary insult comic Don Rickles has died at the age of 90. Variety reports that the standup comedian, whose claims to fame include numerous feisty TV appearances and acting in films ranging from Toy Story to Casino, died at his Los Angeles home from kidney failure Thursday morning. Ironically nicknamed \u201cMr. Warmth,\u201d Rickles epitomized the comedic tactic of jovially insulting people to their faces. In many ways, over a career that began in the late 1940s and lasted until his death, Rickles personified America\u2019s growing postwar cynicism and increasing turn toward ironic entertainment.",
        "Details coming out of Rex Tillerson\u2019s State Department tell a story of staff vacancies, scarce meetings, and general bewilderment from aides who have worked through multiple administrations. The emerging picture is of a secretary of state who has given little direction to his team on how he plans to run the diplomatic wing of the US government. State Department employees are even discouraged from making eye contact with Tillerson while he\u2019s in the office, the Washington Post reported last week.",
        "The YouTube video shows girls convulsing in hospital beds, on the floors of their schools, losing control of their bodies, unable to walk or talk. The young women have allegedly just been given shots of the HPV vaccine to prevent cervical cancer. Instead of a lifesaving treatment, they\u2019re left crippled, \u201cchemically lobotomized. \u201d A voice over the disturbing footage screams: \u201cI am not a slave. You cannot force me to inject my kid with this poison. This is sick!\u201d That voice belongs to Owen Shroyer, a reporter for Infowars, the conspiracy theory \u2014 laden \u201cnews\u201d site.",
        "Bill O\u2019Reilly made clear what he thinks of sexual harassment more than a decade ago. \u201dI think that the sexual harassment thing is used as a club, as I said, by many women,\u201d he said on a March 2004 episode of his Fox News show, The O\u2019Reilly Factor. \u201dIt\u2019s something they have against men, a threat to keep men at bay in a very competitive marketplace.\u201d He isn\u2019t the only prominent man who has propagated the idea that sexual harassment is a myth created by women to bring down men.",
        "Earlier this week, I sketched out what I think is the most plausible outcome for climate policy over the next four years of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. To wit: Despite Trump\u2019s regulatory rollbacks, wind and solar power will keep growing, coal will keep declining, and US emissions will dip modestly. But without a big federal policy push, it\u2019s unlikely the US will be on track for the \u201cdeep decarbonization\u201d that\u2019s really needed to stop global warming. That task will fall to a future president. In this post, I\u2019d like to explain why that prediction could very well be wrong!",

Two major insurers said this week that they wouldn\u2019t sell insurance in Iowa\u2019s Obamacare marketplace, both citing concerns about the current uncertainty around the health law\u2019s future.

        "The American Health Care Act, the Republican plan to replace Obamacare, failed for one main reason: Republicans can\u2019t agree on the best way to change the current system. Despite recent reports indicating a renewed push among Republicans tackle the issue of health care, this problem isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. In this episode of The Weeds, Sarah Kliff, Ezra Klein, and Matt Yglesias weigh in on the many forces \u2014 within the Republican Party and beyond \u2014 that brought down the GOP legislation and continue to stymie attempts to reanimate the effort.",
        "Don Rickles had two special gifts: the audacity to make fun of anyone and everyone, often to their faces, and the skill to do it so hilariously that no one really cared he was laying down insult after insult. Rickles died on Thursday at age 90, but his comedic legacy will never be forgotten. He was best known as an insult comic, blessed with a quick, raunchy wit and an utter lack of shame. Whether you were Frank Sinatra or Ronald Reagan or some random person in his audience, you were a fair target. In Mr.",

As the story begins, reporter Brian Reed travels to Woodstock, Alabama, after being contacted by one of the town\u2019s residents, John B. McLemore, to investigate a murder that John believes was committed and then covered up. But soon the podcast takes a hard left turn, with the crime fading into the background as Reed begins to focus on the mysterious story of the town\u2019s residents \u2014 especially John himself.",
        "The showdown over Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch culminated on Thursday as predicted: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( ) triggered the \u201cnuclear option\u201d to eliminate the rule requiring 60 votes to confirm Supreme Court nominees. That paves the way for Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation with just 51 Republican votes. The decision was lamented by senators on both sides of the aisle \u2014 even from Republicans who thought doing so was a necessary evil, given Senate Democrats\u2019 pledge to filibuster Donald Trump\u2019s nominee. \u201cThis is a body blow to the institution,\u201d Sen. John McCain ( ) told reporters on Wednesday.",
        "The Food and Drug Administration just granted the genetic testing company 23andMe approval to tell people whether they are at a higher risk for certain diseases \u2014 after ordering the company to stop doing precisely that in 2013. That\u2019s a big turnaround for the Silicon Valley startup, but it\u2019s not yet clear how helpful these tests will be for people\u2019s health.

        "(Warning: This article contains major spoilers for the entirety of HBO\u2019s limited series, Big Little Lies.) For all of the lethal barbs, snappy comebacks, and compliments dripping with poison condescension that first defined Big Little Lies, the show\u2019s most powerful moments came when no one was speaking at all. The seventh and final episode of HBO\u2019s miniseries (\u201cYou Get What You Need\u201d) let snap all the tension that had coiled into knots over the weeks, somehow both suddenly and in excruciating slow motion.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s rambling, incoherent remarks on federal infrastructure spending during a interview with Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman of the New York Times have set headline writers abuzz with the desire to extract some kind of meaning and news value from his comments. \u201cTrump says infrastructure plan could top $1 trillion,\u201d wrote Marketwatch, while Reuters reports that \u201cTrump says he may use his $1 trillion infrastructure plan as a political incentive.",

        "The Daily Show thinks it\u2019s cracked press secretary Sean Spicer\u2019s particular style of moderating press conferences, and it\u2019s not exactly Melissa McCarthy bellowing about \u201cradical . \u201d In fact, host Trevor Noah marveled, Spicer\u2019s tone has recently shifted away from that initial belligerence, and gone in a fascinating, disturbing direction. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s still incompetent,\u201d Noah clarified, \u201cbut now he does exactly what Trump wants \u2014 which is to show complete disdain for the media.",
        "Protests against the dire state of American policing are working. After the 2014 rise of Black Lives Matter protests over police shootings and brutality, states have passed more and more laws changing how their police departments work. In total, a new report by the policy and research group Vera Institute of Justice found that 34 states and Washington, DC, passed at least 79 laws regarding police in 2015 and 2016 \u2014 compared to fewer than 20 bills in the period before.",

        "Rep. Devin Nunes is stepping aside from the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s deeply troubled and highly politicized investigation into possible ties between President Donald Trump and Russia, removing another of the president\u2019s key defenders in a scandal that shows no signs of abating. \u201cI believe it is in the best interests of the House Intelligence community to have Representative Mike Conaway \u2026 temporarily take charge of the Committee\u2019s Russia investigation,\u201d he said in a statement emailed to press.",

        "Colossal doesn\u2019t want to meet expectations. The new film actively defies categorization. Sometimes it\u2019s a romantic comedy; sometimes it\u2019s something much darker. And sometimes \u2014 quite unexpectedly \u2014 it\u2019s a monster movie, with actual, monsters. All of those components mashed together make for an oddly entertaining, refreshingly original movie. But it\u2019s not just entertaining: Colossal is about how complicated addiction can be, and about the ways our relationships and our histories can make healing messy. Sometimes, the people we think are our friends turn out to be monsters. And sometimes, we\u2019re the monster.",
        "The most emotionally devastating comic book in recent memory features a man coming to grips with his obsolescence, questioning humanity\u2019s squandering nature and gross consumerism, and coping with the scars of war.

Created by writer Mark Russell and artist Steve Pugh, The Flintstones is obsessed with the human frailty that permeates the colorful, funny, Time Bedrock that many of us grew up with. It uses Bedrock\u2019s first family and \u2019s prehistoric vision to tell a basic truth about human nature: that a civilization\u2019s first steps to survival involves someone else\u2019s doom.",
        "I held my toddler\u2019s hand as I walked her into a synagogue for the very first time, her father and infant sister following behind us. With every concrete step almost as tall as her little legs, climbing each one felt like a monumental accomplishment for her, even with my help. We entered the narrow room full of Rachels and Sarahs, were introduced to Eli and Abraham, and found an empty carpet square to sit on, claiming our place in the circle.",
        "\u201dIt is depressing; I\u2019m very depressed,\u201d Republican Sen. John McCain said this week. \u201cWe\u2019re going down the wrong path here,\u201d Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin said. They were both talking about the same thing: the GOP\u2019s potential use of the \u201cnuclear option\u201d to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.

        "Patrick McHenry is a Republican Congress member who serves as the party\u2019s chief deputy whip. Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill today, including Bloomberg\u2019s Sahil Kapur, he offered a defense of Obamacare that sounded like it could have come from a Democrat: GOP chief deputy whip P.

        "Donald Trump lies about the unemployment rate. But his professed skepticism that the American labor market is as healthy as the official 4. 7 percent unemployment rate might lead you to believe feels correct to a lot of people because it does, in fact, capture an important truth about the current state of the American economy. Broadly speaking, most economists would say that\u2019s good. It\u2019s now similar to where it was before the onset of the Great Depression, with some even saying we\u2019re close to \u201cfull employment\u201d in the American workforce.",

He doesn\u2019t want you to buy phones that were assembled in China, because he believes they could literally blow up.

        "As soon as Seema Verma was sworn in as the new administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, overseeing America\u2019s two biggest health programs, she and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price sent a letter to the nation\u2019s 50 state governors promising them new flexibility and freedom in overseeing Medicaid benefits for poor, disabled, and elderly beneficiaries.

        "The cruise missile strikes President Donald Trump launched in reprisal for Bashar \u2019s chemical weapon attack in Syria are well within the norms of American foreign policy. But they fall far outside the stated boundaries of Trump\u2019s foreign policy, and reflect an administration bereft of a consistent, considered approach to the world \u2014 an approach that would make America\u2019s actions predictable to both our friends and enemies, and guide the commitments we\u2019re willing to make in the event of escalation or reprisal.",
        "Progressive activists say they\u2019re dismayed that senior congressional Democrats aren\u2019t more strongly condemning President Donald Trump\u2019s strikes against Syria on Thursday night. Some Democrats in Congress dinged Trump on the process \u2014 not seeking congressional approval \u2014 but largely supported the action itself. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( ) called punishing Syria\u2019s Bashar \u201cthe right thing to do,\u201d and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( ) labeled the strikes a \u201cproportional response. \u201d Pelosi has also called for the House to end its recess and reconvene to discuss the attacks.",
        "President Trump\u2019s decision to bomb a Syrian airfield in response to a deadly chemical weapons attack has inspired a more bipartisan response from Congress than anything else the president has done in his 11 weeks in office.
