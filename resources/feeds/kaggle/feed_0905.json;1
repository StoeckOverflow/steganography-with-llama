        "On Thursday night, President Donald Trump launched a military strike against a Syrian government airbase. The move, made in response to a gas attack by the regime earlier this week, was sudden, and reactions from members of Congress have only just started to come in. Republicans generally were quick to speak out in support of the president\u2019s action. Sens.",
        "Jenny Rellick was born with spinal muscular atrophy, a degenerative disease that causes muscles to waste away. Eight years ago, she was facing pain so severe that her doctors put her on a regimen of two different kinds of opioids. One is a opioid called Kadian that delivers 100 milligrams of morphine or its equivalent (MME) throughout the day. The other is a dose of oxycodone, which she takes in 15 MME increments as needed. Today Rellick, 46, takes anywhere from 175 to 190 MME of these painkillers daily.",
        "President Trump\u2019s official rationale for initiating the first American airstrikes against the Assad regime in Syria struck humanitarian notes, complete with reference to the \u201cbeautiful babies\u201d who \u201cwere cruelly murdered in this very barbaric attack. \u201d Mark Landler of the New York Times reports that \u201cTrump\u2019s heart came first\u201d in ordering the attack. On its face, that\u2019s a striking turnaround from a campaign season track record that was not only generally supportive of Bashar but much more broadly dismissive of humanitarian considerations in general.",

        "On Friday night, Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, will directly align with the Earth and the sun \u2014 the best opportunity to go outside and observe this massive gaseous world and its moon you\u2019ll have this year. This event is called an \u201dopposition,\u201d simply because Jupiter will be directly opposite the sun in orbit. It\u2019s special because when celestial objects are directly opposite the sun, they appear brighter in the sky. And because Jupiter will be near its closest distance to the Earth this year, it will appear slightly bigger.",
        "Late Thursday evening, President Donald Trump ordered the US military to fire dozens of Tomahawk missiles against a Syrian regime airbase. The strike was in response to a chemical gas attack carried out on Tuesday by President Bashar against his own people, which killed at least 85, including about two dozen children. The strike marks the first direct US attack against the Assad regime since the Syrian civil war began in 2011. Here\u2019s what we know and what we don\u2019t know about the strike so far.",
        "The Trump administration has opened the door for states to put new restrictions on their Medicaid programs, and Florida is stepping through it. The state House is advancing a plan to introduce work requirements and charge most enrollees a nominal premium. From the Miami Herald: The Florida House is moving ahead with a plan to force Medicaid recipients to prove they are employed, participating in job training or searching for work in order to receive benefits, the same requirements the state puts on welfare recipients.",
        "On Thursday night, President Trump fired 59 cruise missiles into Syria. It was a limited attack, aimed at a single airbase. We know that the strike was a response to Syrian President Bashar \u2019s gas attack on his own people Tuesday. We don\u2019t know what Trump\u2019s strategy for Syria is: Was this a attack? Part of a plan to remove Assad from power? Something else? This interview is about the strategic wisdom of Trump\u2019s attack, the possible motivations behind it, and what to look for in the days ahead.",
        "On Thursday evening, the US government launched cruise missiles into Syria days after a deadly chemical weapons attack there. Earlier that day, Republicans rammed through a change in Senate rules so they could confirm a Supreme Court justice nominee Democrats had been blocking. Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, it became clear that the GOP\u2019s bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, which the White House had spent the week trying to resurrect, was now dead again. And leaks and infighting among White House staffers reached a new level of intensity, with top aides reportedly believing their jobs are at stake.",
        "President Trump\u2019s Tomahawk strikes on a Syrian airbase Thursday evening has \u2014 predictably \u2014 incensed Russia, Syrian President Bashar \u2019s indispensable ally in the Syrian civil war. In response, Russia has announced it is taking swift new steps to bolster Assad and dropping an agreement with the US on the use of airspace in Syria that could make a clash between the two world powers more likely.",
        "There is more than one way to fight a war. Making movies, for instance. Propaganda films proliferated on all sides of the conflict during World War II, seeking to sway public opinion toward the government\u2019s position and bolster morale. In Britain, the effort was centralized in the Ministry of Information, which was created and then disbanded during both World Wars. The Ministry\u2019s job was to regulate news and monitor the public mood as the war raged on, shaping coverage to keep spirits up.",
        "Republicans in Congress are lining up to support President Donald Trump\u2019s decision Thursday night to direct the US military to launch a series of strikes against Syrian targets. But when asked about this very issue in a 2015 primary debate, many of the same Republicans now praising Trump had conflicting views on the subject. In the debate, they were asked about their views on Syrian intervention following Syrian President Bashar \u2019s forces launching sarin gas \u2014 a deadly chemical considered a weapon of mass destruction \u2014 into the Damascus suburb of Ghouta in 2013.",
        "President Trump probably isn\u2019t happy with the latest jobs report. The number of nonfarm jobs created in March \u2014 98, 000 \u2014 was far lower than economists had predicted. In February, the number was more than twice as high. Economists believe this has a lot to do with the weather. A record number of construction jobs were added in February because of the unusually warm temperatures. That was followed by a cold front in March, which chilled job growth in the industry.",
        "Friday morning, the White House released a photo of President Donald Trump and his national security team being briefed on the missile strike against the Syrian regime at the Secure Compartmented Information Facility that\u2019s been assembled at his resort.

        "On Thursday night, President Donald Trump launched a military strike against a Syrian government airbase. The move, made in response to a gas attack by the regime of Syrian President Bashar earlier this week, took place while most US allies in Europe and the Middle East were asleep. But within a few hours, reactions began to trickle out. The support came from predictable corners \u2014 Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Israel. Russia, the Assad regime\u2019s most important overseas ally, predictably issued a swift condemnation.",
        "Another state has legalized medical marijuana. This time, West Virginia became the 29th state to allow cannabis for medicinal purposes after Gov.

        "Smurfs: The Lost Village is an overlong, exhausting, but remarkably animated reboot starring the little blue characters who first entered public consciousness in 1958, when the Belgian comics artist Peyo created them. Since then, they\u2019ve been the subject of comic books, animated TV series, films, and a host of merchandising. And now they\u2019re all set for their in a new era.",
        "The standard critique of Joan Didion \u2014 insofar as there is a standard critique of the legend, one of America\u2019s greatest prose stylists and a pioneer of new journalism, she of the inscrutable photograph \u2014 is that she is a cold and writer. That her exquisitely polished and balanced sentences concern only herself, and never her ostensible subjects. Didion, says Barbara Grizzuti Harrison in her famous 1980 takedown, reports almost exclusively on \u201cDidion\u2019s sensibility,\u201d noting that in the author\u2019s essays, said sensibility \u201cassumes more importance than, say, the existence of the electric chair.",
        "The world has agreed to a set of shared targets on climate change. Those targets require deep (80 to 100 percent) decarbonization, relatively quickly. What\u2019s the best way to get fully decarbonized? In my previous post, I summarized a raging debate on that subject. Let\u2019s quickly review. We know that deep decarbonization is going to involve an enormous amount of electrification. As we push carbon out of the electricity sector, we pull other energy services like transportation and heating into it. (My slogan for this: electrify everything.) This means lots more demand for electricity, even as electricity decarbonizes.",
        "\u201cIn my view, Trump wouldn\u2019t be president if not for Bob. It doesn\u2019t get much more effective than that. \u201d That\u2019s a quote from Nick Patterson, a computational biologist who New Yorker writer Jane Mayer interviewed for her recent sweeping profile of Robert Mercer. Mercer is a reclusive computer scientist and manager. He\u2019s also the billionaire financier behind Breitbart. com, the Donald Trump campaign, a data analytics firm called Cambridge Analytica (which worked on behalf of Trump) and a whole range of conservative online publications and advocacy groups. Early in the presidential campaign, Mercer was a Ted Cruz backer.",
        "When Paul Ryan\u2019s push to repeal the Affordable Care Act collapsed earlier this spring, the Trump administration\u2019s initial reaction was that it would simply move on to tax reform. But it\u2019s quickly become apparent that a key problem in the White House\u2019s push for tax reform is that the White House has absolutely no idea what it actually wants to see changed about the tax code. Brady told Dems today he\u2019s committed to border adjustment and hopes to provide tax bill this spring, Dem spox says \u2014 Ylan Q.",
        "Every single episode of The Get Down, Baz Luhrmann and Stephen Adly Guirgis\u2019s Netflix series about the early days of feels like a season finale. Every installment is packed with huge moments, even bigger montages, and emotional landmines constantly threatening to explode. It\u2019s a show that ratchets up the sound design even in its quiet moments. It never met a volume dial it couldn\u2019t turn up to 11. Rating This is a perverse part of the series\u2019 charm, especially in the second half of the series\u2019 first season.",
        "Donald Trump spent his initial weeks in office promising to make a decisive break from what he described as years of failed Obama administration policies toward Israel, ISIS, China, and Russia \u2014 only to basically keep all of Obama\u2019s policies in place. That\u2019s over now. After giving the order to bomb Syria after a deadly chemical weapon attack, Trump has begun charting his own path as commander in chief.",
        "President Donald Trump, on the campaign trail, was firmly against intervening in Syria. Even before he ran for president, he demanded that President Barack Obama not send troops into Syria and argued for not using military force against Bashar . America, he argued, had wasted valuable blood and treasure abroad and needed to spend more time nation building at home: We should stop talking, stay out of Syria and other countries that hate us, rebuild our own country and make it strong and great ! \u2014 Donald J.",
        "After President Donald Trump ordered a missile strike on a Syrian airbase Thursday in direct response to a Syrian regime \u2014 ordered gas attack on civilians earlier this week, many Republican lawmakers applauded his leadership. For a lot of them, it was an from four years ago. In 2013, President Barack Obama asked Congress for military authorization to intervene in Syria after a similar chemical attack. But Republicans in Congress said no. House Speaker Paul Ryan was among them.",
        "Late on Thursday, the United States launched a cruise missile strike against a Syrian regime airbase \u2014 the first intentional US strike on Bashar \u2019s forces since the Syrian war began in 2011. The strike was in direct response to a chemical weapon attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun on Tuesday, which killed at least 85 civilians (23 of whom were children). After the strike, President Trump spoke to reporters to explain the administration\u2019s reasoning for escalating America\u2019s role in Syria\u2019s war.",
        "The US officially launched a strike on Syria on Thursday night, just days after the Syrian regime launched a chemical weapon attack on that country\u2019s civilians. We now have video of that strike. Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesperson, gave the following statement with the video: At the direction of the president, U. S. forces conducted a cruise missile strike against a Syrian Air Force airfield today at about 8:40 p. m. EDT (4:40 a. m. April 7, in Syria).",
        "On Thursday night, President Donald Trump announced that the US had launched strikes against the regime of Syrian president Bashar in retaliation for Assad\u2019s use of the chemical weapon sarin in an attack that killed dozens of civilians. \u201dNo child of God,\u201d Trump said in a statement, \u201dshould ever suffer such horror.\u201d But the damage has already been done \u2014 and America, including President Trump himself, is already deeply culpable."
