        "The United States has just intentionally bombed a Syrian regime target for the first time since the country\u2019s civil war began in 2011. So far, it has been a limited cruise missile strike targeting one Syrian airbase, causing an number of casualties. \u201dDozens of Tomahawks were launched against a single Syrian regime airfield,\u201d a Department of Defense official told Vox. The decision to attack was a direct reaction to the Syrian regime\u2019s Tuesday gas attack that claimed 85 lives, including about two dozen children.",

        "On the face of it, President Trump\u2019s decision to attack Syria doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. Launching 59 missiles at a single airbase, as Trump did, is not going to seriously change the outcome of a civil war. So what\u2019s the point of doing it at all? Understanding the answer to that question, and really anything the United States does and does not do in Syria, requires understanding the real nature of the country\u2019s horrific civil war.",
        "This week, Henry Rollins \u2014 musician, writer, actor, radio and television host, and generally fascinating human \u2014 answers our questions. What\u2019s the first piece of media you consume every day? I read articles online. Huffington Post, New York Times, BBC, Washington Post. Name a writer or publication you disagree with but still read. I\u2019ve read Cheney\u2019s and Bush\u2019s autobiographies. Books by Sarah Palin and Anne Coulter. I read articles on Breitbart. Who is the person who has most influenced the way you think? Ian MacKaye for the good things.",
        "Uber has fired the star engineer who has been at the center of its legal battle with Waymo, Google\u2019s car unit. The engineer, Anthony Levandowski, is a former Waymo engineer who left to start a truck company that was quickly acquired by Uber. Waymo sued Uber, charging that Levandowski stole confidential information on the way out the door and used the information in his new job at Uber. But when Waymo tried to force Levandowski to turn over the documents, Levandowski invoked the Fifth Amendment right against instead.",
        "Nearly every article you read about Your Name, a 2016 Japanese animated film that made its American debut April 7, will mention, offhand, that it\u2019s one of the biggest films of all time in Japan. Bigger than any Harry Potter or Marvel film. Bigger than Avatar. Bigger than every other Japanese movie not named Spirited Away (which remains the biggest film in Japanese box office history).",
        "The gravest danger facing Obamacare now is not legislative action \u2014 it\u2019s executive inaction. Fortunately for the millions who rely on the Affordable Care Act, the states can save the health care law from \u201cexploding. \u201d But they need to move fast. President Donald Trump\u2019s latest bid to repeal the ACA looks as though it\u2019s destined to meet the same fate as House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s failed effort last month. Still, Trump has the ability \u2014 and quite likely the inclination \u2014 to undermine the health care law by deliberately failing to carry out important elements of it.",
        "Every weekend, we pick a movie you can stream that dovetails with current events. Old, new, blockbuster, arthouse: They\u2019re all fair game. What you can count on is a weekend watch that sheds new light on the week that was. The movie of the week for April 8 through 15 is Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, which is available to digitally rent on Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, YouTube, and Vudu. Most of what Congress does has consequences, but isn\u2019t terribly interesting to watch.",
        "I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so weird that Pierce Brosnan is playing the patriarch of a sprawling Texas family in AMC\u2019s new Western The Son. His accent isn\u2019t bad (though you can hear hints of his native Irish accent here and there) and his performance is generally quite solid. But there\u2019s something off about him all the same \u2014 as if there\u2019s no way he would ever be the head of this particular family.",
        "So a lot happened this week, huh?

        "When Donald Trump ran for president, he showed no interest in seeking the ouster of Syrian President Bashar and fantasized routinely about the idea of working with his most powerful ally and protector, Russia, to defeat ISIS in Syria and Iraq. \u201dWouldn\u2019t it be nice if we got together with Russia and knocked the hell out of ISIS?\u201d he frequently asked his audience on the campaign trail.",
        "Days after President Trump launched 59 Tomahawk missiles at Syrian President Bashar \u2019s airbase, the administration sent the big guns out to the Sunday morning talk shows to defend and explain the action. Trump\u2019s people forcefully said \u201cregime change is something that we think is going to happen\u201d but were far less clear about when or how that might happen. Collectively, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, National Security Adviser H. R.",
        "\u201cMaking feminism a universal pursuit might look like a good thing,\u201d author Jessa Crispin writes, \u201cbut in truth it progresses, and I think accelerates, a process that has been detrimental to the feminist movement. \u201d Crispin has written a polemic titled Why I am Not a Feminist, in which she laments the banality of contemporary feminism. Her thesis is simple enough: At some point, feminism lost its political moorings; it became vapid and toothless in its quest for universality. Feminism became a term for for individual achievement.",
        "Wow, is Alec Baldwin getting sick of playing Donald Trump or what? Baldwin announced a month ago that he plans to hang up his orange spray tan in the near future, ostensibly because he\u2019s worried viewers will get tired of him. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much more people can take it,\u201d he said. But judging by the shockingly cold open to the latest episode of Saturday Night Live \u2014 the show\u2019s first in nearly a month \u2014 Baldwin just can\u2019t take playing Trump anymore. The sketch featured Baldwin\u2019s Trump visiting a group of his supporters in Kentucky.",

The episode of the week for April 2 through April 8 is \u201cR Is for Romeo,\u201d the 11th episode of the sixth season of Showtime\u2019s Homeland. Stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one before. The president, angry, accuses a media personality of peddling fake news.",
        "The president\u2019s executive orders seeking to restrict immigration from selected countries have turned our immigration system into a partisan battleground. But despite President Donald Trump\u2019s heated rhetoric about refugees and immigrants, there are some things on which reasonable people on both sides of the debate can agree. The vast majority of migrants, be they refugees, guest workers, or permanent immigrants, pose no threat, and there is no serious doubt that some immigration is economically beneficial.",
        "When I was finally diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at 27, the thing that helped me the most wasn\u2019t therapy or autism organizations. It wasn\u2019t even my introduction to the neurodiversity movement and the idea that I didn\u2019t have to be \u201ccured\u201d to have a worthwhile life. It was watching television. One of my favorite shows was the cult favorite sitcom Community. The character Abed Nadir, though never officially labeled autistic on the show, is heavily coded as autistic. He was intensely interested in pop culture, and his use of sarcasm was a work in progress.",
        "It\u2019s clear from the Trump administration\u2019s 2018 budget proposal: The administration doesn\u2019t think spending at the National Institutes of Health is a very good deal. The budget suggests cutting $6 billion from the NIH \u2014 or nearly a quarter of the agency\u2019s total budget. The main problem with NIH, according to the White House, is the size of the agency\u2019s budget.",
        "The details certainly make it sound like a hate crime: A white man, who\u2019s a member of a Facebook group called \u201c : Nation\u201d (a combination of the white nationalist \u201calt right\u201d and a reference to the Nazi Third Reich) stabbed a black man at the University of Maryland campus \u2014 killing Richard Collins. But so far, local law enforcement isn\u2019t calling the act a hate crime. Instead, officials have said they will wait until they are further into the investigation to determine a motive.",
        "Fast and Furious 8: The Fate of the Furious, the latest chapter in Universal\u2019s box office \u2014 throttling franchise, is a clinic in lunacy, destruction, and unbridled joy. In other words, it lives to up the Fast & Furious legacy. Director F. Gary Gray has the keys this time around, and gives the franchise a gut punch of a twist: Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) has turned on his team and, under the command of the nuclear winter blonde villain known as Cipher (Charlize Theron) threatens to destroy the Furious family and everything we love about them.",
        "When Pepsi released its astonishingly ad earlier this week, there was a single question on everyone\u2019s mind: How on earth did that ad get made? Dozens of people have to sign off on a massive, ad campaign for a giant global brand. How could they all have thought it was a good idea to suggest that the key to ending police brutality is to present the cops with soda? How did no one suggest that it might not be great to appropriate the Black Lives Matter movement so crassly and with such little grace?",
        "A scandal involving an extramarital affair with a key staffer and an alleged by law enforcement led Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley to resign Monday after briefly being booked into jail. The scandal has been a train wreck for Bentley, a Republican who surprised the state\u2019s political establishment by winning his party\u2019s nomination in 2010 and then easily won election and reelection in a deeply conservative state. But beginning during Bentley\u2019s second term, an affair with a key staffer, Rebekah Mason, and the collapse of his marriage led to a steady of embarrassing revelations culminating in his likely resignation.",
        "This is the line that should vanquish any doubt that President Donald Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions want to escalate America\u2019s war on drugs. \u201cThe federal criminal justice system simply is not broken. In fact, it\u2019s working exactly as designed. \u201d The comment comes from Steven Cook, a top lieutenant in Sessions\u2019s inner circle who often travels by the attorney general\u2019s side as he speaks about the new administration\u2019s goals.",
        "On April 10, 2017, the Pulitzer committee released its 101st class of winners. The Pulitzer, which honors America\u2019s strongest journalistic and creative work, is usually chosen from a pool of finalists selected by experts in each category (the Pulitzer jury) and then narrowed down to a single winner by the Pulitzer board. But the board is not bound to the finalist list created by the jury; that\u2019s just a recommendation. In fact, some years the Pulitzer board has declined to pick a winner at all for certain categories.",
        "White House press secretary Sean Spicer just announced a policy that would mean constant and unending US involvement in Syria\u2019s civil war \u2014 if the Trump team is actually serious about it. During a daily press briefing on Monday, Spicer was asked what Bashar \u2019s regime could do to trigger another bombing attack like the one last Thursday. Would it have to be a chemical weapons attack, or would more conventional bombings targeting civilians also trigger US retaliation? Spicer\u2019s answer was surprising.",
        "United Airlines is getting a lot of negative press after videos showed security guards forcibly removing a paying customer from a flight scheduled to fly from Chicago to Louisville. @United overbook #flight3411 and decided to force random passengers off the plane. Here\u2019s how they did it: pic. twitter. \u2014 Jayse D. Anspach (@JayseDavid) April 10, 2017 The flight was overbooked, and United needed to find seats for four of its crew members so they could staff later flights taking off from Louisville.",
        "Elon Musk is having a great year. Last month his rocket company, SpaceX, made history by reusing a rocket \u2014 an achievement that could dramatically reduce the cost of spaceflight in the coming years. Meanwhile, his electric car company, Tesla, has seen its stock price soar. In early April, Tesla\u2019s market value surpassed Ford\u2019s as Wall Street got excited about Tesla\u2019s forthcoming Model 3. SpaceX and Tesla were far from overnight successes. Tesla repeatedly delayed the introduction of its first car. The first three SpaceX rocket launches all failed. Both companies nearly went bankrupt during the 2008 financial crisis.",
        "During the campaign, it was easy to scoff at President Donald Trump\u2019s promise to build a \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d concrete wall along the border. It sounded, well, preposterous. But now the prospect of a border wall is quite real. Trump intends to request $4. 1 billion over the next two years to build it. The Department of Homeland Security is reviewing proposals for designs that are \u201cphysically imposing in height\u201d and \u201caesthetically pleasing in color. \u201d There\u2019s a long debate over whether physical barriers on the border actually curb the illicit flow of people and drugs.",

The story is quickly developing, so some details may be wrong and may change. But here\u2019s a rundown of what we know, based on the best information available so far: At least three people were killed and one was injured in a shooting in a special needs classroom at North Park Elementary School, according to police. One of the dead was Jonathan Martinez."
