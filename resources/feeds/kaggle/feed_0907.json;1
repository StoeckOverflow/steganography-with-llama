        "Colson Whitehead\u2019s The Underground Railroad \u2014 about a woman escaping from slavery, with just a hint of magical realism \u2014 has won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, which means Colson Whitehead is having a very good year indeed. The Pulitzer comes after The Underground Railroad won the National Book Award, after it was selected for Oprah\u2019s Book Club, and after Moonlight director Barry Jenkins signed on to adapt it for television.",
        "The video looks more like something out of your nightmares than a message from the local sheriff\u2019s department. The Facebook video, posted by the Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Office in Florida, stars Sheriff Peyton Grinnell as he\u2019s backed up by four masked deputies. It\u2019s supposed to be a signal that the sheriff\u2019s office is taking the opioid epidemic very seriously.",
        "We are living in the era of the computer algorithm. Data science drives the global economy \u2014 to the point where, for many people, an algorithm will play a role in everything from what news articles they read to whom they will date \u2014 or even marry. So it\u2019s no surprise that political scientists would want to use an algorithm to improve political redistricting, a process that is often distorted by partisan maneuverings. About 30 years before Ada Lovelace created the world\u2019s first algorithm, a notorious political cartoon appeared in the Boston Gazette.",

Sign up to get VoxCare in your inbox here. The White House\u2019s decision to stay mum on certain health policy issues \u2014 particularly whether it will fund key Obamacare payments for enrollees \u2014 has left insurers skittish about selling marketplace coverage in 2018. Health insurers say they can\u2019t make decisions about participating in the health law marketplaces until the Trump administration makes its policies clearer.",
        "When you run a big company like United Airlines, it\u2019s hard to prevent your employees from occasionally doing something dumb, like violently removing a paying customer from a flight. But what should be fairly easy is to issue a heartfelt apology once the issue comes to your attention. On Monday, United CEO Oscar Munoz screwed that up big time: United CEO response to United Express Flight 3411. pic. twitter.",
        "For a lot of Americans and Yorkers, the number \u201c212\u201d holds no special significance. Neither does the number \u201c51. \u201d But for comic book artist Ardian Syaf, who slipped the numbers into Marvel\u2019s newest comic book, they represent an message. It\u2019s particularly inflammatory and disappointing that it was smuggled into the a team that\u2019s represented inclusivity, empathy, and tolerance. Syaf is Indonesian artist, and in Indonesia, \u201c212\u201d denotes a mass protest against Jakarta\u2019s Christian Gov. Basuki Tjahaja Purnama. Meanwhile, as the comics news websites Bleeding Cool and ComicBook.",
        "The unifying theme of the Trump era is that all subtext must become text. Nothing can remain implied; it\u2019s all got to be out in the open, obvious and crude. Take President Trump\u2019s promises to the US coal industry. His effort to prop up coal is as is its futility.",
        "On Sunday night, French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen of the Front National party denied French responsibility for the brutal fate of the 76, 000 Jews deported from France during the Second World War. Only 3, 000 returned. In so doing, she reignited a conversation on both the FN\u2019s xenophobic roots and the French state\u2019s role in World War II. She may also have irreparably damaged her chances for the presidency. Le Pen has spent the past several years trying to distance herself from her party\u2019s past.",
        "Since February, John Oliver and Last Week Tonight have been producing educational ads starring a friendly cowboy with a targeted audience of one: President Donald Trump. The idea is that if they air during specific cable news programs, the ads could, given the president\u2019s reliance on cable news, get through to him on crucial issues, like climate change or how the unemployment rate works, in a way that articles or congressional hearings wouldn\u2019t.",
        "One of President Trump\u2019s top aides says it\u2019s hard to publicly explain the administration\u2019s foreign policy for a simple reason: The White House doesn\u2019t appear to actually have a foreign policy. That\u2019s one of the main takeaways from an article in Politico about the White House\u2019s efforts to gain its footing after a rocky first three months in office. According to the account by Shane Goldmacher, more than 30 Trump administration officials held a meeting last week in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, near the White House, to talk about improving the administration\u2019s public messaging.",
        "Not too long ago, it seemed like Baltimore \u2014 a progressive city with lots of workers \u2014 would be an easy win for the nationwide movement to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour. Labor unions, churches, and advocacy groups had won support for the measure from the city council. Mayor Catherine Pugh made it a campaign promise. Then Pugh got cold feet and vetoed the bill, and the entire effort fell apart April 3 when council members couldn\u2019t get enough signatures to override her veto.",
        "On Friday, the Senate confirmed Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch before heading out of town for an recess. When they return to the Capitol on April 22, they\u2019ll almost immediately run into a hard deadline: Congress has until April 28 to pass a new budget to avert a government shutdown, or pass a \u201ccontinuing resolution\u201d to temporarily lock last year\u2019s funding for the government in place. If they fail to do either, Donald Trump\u2019s 100th day in office \u2014 April 29 \u2014 would be marked by a government shutdown.",
        "There\u2019s a particular kind of satisfaction to be had in skewering the pleasures of the global . It\u2019s not just that their stuff is expensive, or stuffy, or morally reprehensible \u2014 though it often is that. It\u2019s that it\u2019s often terrible, and we\u2019re all supposed to act like it isn\u2019t because the rich people say so. (Think golf, an agonizingly slow walk that we all pretend is a sport so bankers can play at being athletes.) This is the genius of Jay Rayner\u2019s review of Le Cinq, a star restaurant in Paris.",
        "\u201cUsing military force without a broader strategy is a pretty empty gesture. It\u2019s actually quite dangerous. \u201d That\u2019s the blunt assessment of retired Gen. John Allen, who led the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to coordinate an international effort against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. His 12 months in the job left him with a unique perspective on Syria\u2019s grinding civil war \u2014 and on the impact of President Trump\u2019s decision to strike Syria last week after a brutal chemical weapons attack there.",
        "\u201cNo child of God should ever suffer such horror. \u201d That was the critical line in Donald Trump\u2019s statement explaining his decision to bomb a Syrian airbase in response to the April 4 chemical attack in Khan Sheikhoun, Syria. I couldn\u2019t agree more with that sentence. In this view, at least, Trump is right: No child should ever endure such horror. I began working with refugees in Austin, Texas, in 2007, and in a decade of being friends with, supporting, and interviewing refugees from dozens of countries around the world, I have heard countless stories of atrocities.",
        "The success of populists in Europe and North America has led many to question the viability of multiculturalism. Steve Chapman, a reporter for the Chicago Tribune, asked last summer: \u201cHas the great American experiment in diversity ended in failure?\u201d Even German Chancellor Angela Merkel, often admired for her reasonableness and tolerance, remarked in 2015 that multiculturalism has been revealed to be a \u201clife lie\u201d or a sham.",
        "The very first trailer for Thor: Ragnarok has arrived, giving us the first glimpse at what Chris Hemsworth\u2019s Thor and Mark Ruffalo\u2019s Hulk have been up to since Avengers: Age of Ultron. It also lets us see Cate Blanchett\u2019s Hela for the first time, and is completely weird in the best way possible. Thor is in a battle with the Hulk. Hela stops Mj\u00f8llnir with her bare hands and lays ruin to Asgard. And Jeff Goldblum looks spectacularly bizarre.",
        "The great pendulum of Anne Hathaway hatred has begun to swing the other way. When Hathaway greeted her 2013 Oscar win with a whispered, \u201cIt came true!\u201d she was one of the most hated movie stars in America. People hated her constant smile, her eagerness, her desperate and palpable thirst for approval. \u201cMy my,\u201d said Alexis Rhiannon on Crushable, in what would become the iconic manifesto of the Hathahater, \u201cwhat a large beautiful mouth. I don\u2019t like it. Look at those dark beautiful eyes. I don\u2019t like them. Listen to her skinny beautiful words. I don\u2019t like them.",
        "When I was 3 or 4, some friends of my parents threw a party; the kids went and played in the basement while the adults sat upstairs and talked. Halfway through, I walked back up to the \u2019 area; the kids were playing I had no idea what was happening or what the rules were, and none of the kids would tell me. My mom started to explain when another mother interrupted. You shouldn\u2019t tell kids the rules, she told my mom \u2014 they have to figure it out for themselves.",
        "\u201cThe American healthcare system is rigged against you,\u201d journalist Elisabeth Rosenthal writes in her new book, An American Sickness. Rosenthal got a peek at the bamboozling when she was working full time as a doctor in the 1990s. She remembers one appendectomy patient, already in a hospital gown, pleading, \u201cYou guys [already] took my wallet \u2026 I don\u2019t have a credit card. \u201d The hospital was hassling the patient for a credit card number before continuing with the procedure, and the patient had to scramble to recover a card number from a friend before the operation could begin.",
        "\u201dNAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country,\u201d declared candidate Donald Trump during a September debate with Hillary Clinton. On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to drastically change the free trade pact to make it a winning deal for the US \u2014 and threatened to scrap the deal altogether if he didn\u2019t get what he wanted. But a draft proposal from the Trump administration that\u2019s been circulating in Congress recently doesn\u2019t appear to push for a radical transformation of NAFTA, or portend its destruction. In fact, it actually sounds .",
        "In Tuesday\u2019s briefing, press secretary Sean Spicer said something astounding \u2014 that Syrian dictator Bashar compared unfavorably, at least in one respect, to Adolf Hitler. \u201dHitler didn\u2019t even sink to the level of using chemical weapons,\u201d Spicer said. You\u2019re probably spotting at least one obvious problem here: The Nazis used poison gas as one of the principal means of exterminating the Jewish people. At one point, 6, 000 Jews were gassed to death every day in Auschwitz alone, according to the US Holocaust Museum. Surely, Sean Spicer knows this. He has to know this.",
        "On Monday, August 22, 2016, a surgical team at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore removed my left kidney. It was then drained of blood, flushed with a preservative solution, placed on ice, and flown to Cincinnati. Surgeons in Cincinnati then transplanted the kidney into a recipient I\u2019d never met and whose name I didn\u2019t know; we didn\u2019t correspond until this past month. The only thing I knew about him at the time was that he needed my kidney more than I did.",
        "The Trump administration knows it hasn\u2019t gotten off to a very impressive start, with Shane Goldmacher reporting that officials are increasingly panicked about a likely impending wave of stories about a first 100 days devoid of major achievements and Maggie Haberman reporting that \u201csome form of overall review\u201d is in the works that could be used to generate a . Meanwhile, tensions between chief strategist Steve Bannon and the rising star of chief Jared Kushner have been openly aired in multiple media outlets.",
        "United Airlines\u2019 motto invites its customers to \u201cfly the friendly skies\u201d aboard its planes. But the airline\u2019s actions on the ground will make you think twice. On Sunday, police at O\u2019Hare International Airport in Chicago boarded a United flight to Louisville prior to takeoff and physically pulled a man out of his seat, ultimately dragging him down the aisle and off the plane by his arms after he refused to leave the seat he had paid for. Videos of the incident taken by passengers quickly spread online. @United overbook #flight3411 and decided to force random passengers off the plane.",

        "On Tuesday afternoon, United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz did what he should have done 24 hours earlier: offer a clear and unconditional apology for Sunday\u2019s fiasco, in which a paying customer was violently removed from a United airplane. United CEO Oscar Munoz: I\u2019m sorry.

        "Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker doesn\u2019t seem to care how many hours schoolkids are in the classroom, as long as they can pass standardized tests \u2014 a proposal that could go against the academic consensus that time in the classroom matters. In his recent budget proposal, Walker called for state lawmakers to get rid of the minimum requirement for how many hours students spend learning each year. That would make Wisconsin the first state without any guidelines for how long students must spend in the classroom.",
        "President Donald Trump has said he won\u2019t be attending this year\u2019s White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner, but there will still be a comedian at the podium cracking jokes about him \u2014 and a perfectly fitting one, at that. Less than three weeks before the April 29 event, the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, which puts on the annual event, has finally announced a host: The Daily Show\u2019s Hasan Minhaj. This is somewhat surprising, if only because it hasn\u2019t been clear whether the dinner would have a host at all, or what the dinner itself will even be."
