        "A dead child became the collateral damage of domestic violence. That\u2019s the basic understanding of the North Park Elementary School shooting in San Bernardino, California, on Monday: The gunman, Cedric Anderson, was apparently targeting the teacher, who was his wife, Karen Smith. But when he opened fire in a special needs classroom, an and a were hit by stray bullets \u2014 killing the and wounding the . Fundamentally, this was a domestic violence situation that spiraled into a classroom. Police say Anderson was going after Smith, who was trying to divorce him after their brief marriage suddenly turned violent.",
        "United Airlines is in the midst of a scandal over a viral video of a passenger being forcibly dragged off one of its flights by police officers for refusing to give up his seat on an overbooked flight, and its atrocious public relations response that followed. But another airline is having a field day with it. Royal Jordanian Airlines promptly sent out a series of tweets brilliantly trolling United for the debacle and ensuring customers that they will not be violently removed from Royal Jordanian flights.",
        "The courthouse is supposed to be a place where justice is not only meted out to the perpetrators of crimes but offered as protection to its victims. But around the country, immigrants showing up for their day in court \u2014 as defendants, witnesses, or victims seeking redress \u2014 are encountering a different face of the law instead: They\u2019re being arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers seeking to deport them after they leave the courthouse, or even when they\u2019re still within its walls.",
        "When we encounter a stranger, one of our first (unconscious) thoughts is a question: Is there a mind in there? As humans, we have a unique ability to recognize others as having minds \u2014 capable of feeling, thinking, and acting \u2014 separate from our own. And the answer to the question \u201cIs there a mind in there?\u201d is a key predictor of how much we sympathize and empathize with one another.",
        "Bizarrely venturing into a controversy in which he was not otherwise involved, President Donald Trump told reporters for the New York Times last week that Bill O\u2019Reilly \u201cis a good person\u201d and that he didn\u2019t do \u201canything wrong. \u201d The comments came on the heels of the revelation that Fox News has settled with five women who claimed O\u2019Reilly, the Fox megastar, sexually harassed them. According to the Times, payouts to these women, who worked for him or had been guests on his show, total about $13 million.",
        "Easter season is upon us, and if you\u2019re like a majority of Americans who celebrate the holiday, you\u2019ll probably purchase some candy for the occasion. And that stash will likely include the hallmark of the season: Peeps. But just where did these squishy harbingers of spring come from? And why are they so popular? Read on to find out. Mmm, marshmallows with eyes In their traditional form, Peeps are shaped like baby chickens and made of a soft marshmallow rolled in colored sugar, with eyes made of edible wax. They are typically sold in packs of five conjoined marshmallows.",
        "In just one day, two shooting incidents shook the nation as a congressional baseball practice in Virginia, and a UPS facility in San Francisco both became the settings for gun violence. These two incidents on Wednesday are yet another contribution to the count of mass shootings in America. The shootings quickly led to calls for more gun control. Americans have heard these types of calls before: After every mass shooting, the debate over guns and gun violence sparks up once again. Maybe some bills get introduced.",
        "About two months ago, Colin Curtis received a call from a friend in his native state of Kansas with a request: The friend was leading a Democratic candidate\u2019s campaign for a House district in the Wichita area, and he wanted Curtis to join. \u201cI was pretty skeptical. I said that I thought it sounded crazy,\u201d said Curtis, who was at the time living in Washington, DC, and working at the political consulting firm The Strategy Group. But he agreed to sign on. \u201cI told my friends, and they said, \u2018Well, good luck.",
        "Eleanor Wasserberg\u2019s new novel Foxlowe is an insidiously creepy little book, modern in its understanding of psychology but purely Victorian gothic in its atmosphere. Rating It\u2019s told by a girl named Green, who grows up in a decaying mansion called Foxlowe in the English countryside. She\u2019s living in our time, but you couldn\u2019t tell from the way her life works: Green is raised by a group that describes itself to Green as \u201cthe Family\u201d and to outsiders as \u201ca commune,\u201d but which is clearly a cult.",
        "For decades, presidential administrations have tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to curb North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program. The Trump administration\u2019s approach so far has been both aggressive and confusing. Three months ago, for example, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson released a statement that read: \u201cThe United States has spoken enough about North Korea. We have no further comment. \u201d Does that mean negotiations are over? It\u2019s not clear. Tillerson insisted that America\u2019s policy remains a denuclearized North Korea, not regime change, but it\u2019s apparent that relations between North Korea and the United States are increasingly strained.",
        "You might have expected the first press conference in Moscow featuring both a Trump administration official and a Russian official to be something of a victory lap. After all, Trump was Russia\u2019s preferred candidate in the 2016 election; he had promised to realign US foreign policy to work with Moscow. He even picked Rex Tillerson, an oil magnate and a man to whom Vladimir Putin personally awarded a Russian state medal, to be secretary of state. But you\u2019d be wrong.",
        "After what amounts to a series of disasters, the American aviation industry is finally in a good place. Overcapacity and fare wars have been eliminated, redundant staff is gone, and with the economy improving, people are buying plane tickets again. Which is exactly how United Airlines found itself dragging an unwilling customer off an overbooked flight to Louisville, Kentucky, incurring a massive PR fiasco and reminding us that the industry is likely to bounce forever between exploitative and unprofitable.",
        "In 1980, the radical feminist Robin Morgan wrote, \u201cPornography is the theory. Rape is the practice. \u201d That\u2019s not a perfect formulation; feminism and feminist pornography both exist. But the idea that sexualized violence against women is the practice of a theory propagated by a form of media is useful for understanding Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s slow downfall at Fox News. The host has just been dismissed from the network by its parent company, 21st Century Fox, ending his tenure.",
        "The idea of capturing carbon dioxide from coal plants, gas plants, and other industrial facilities and burying the pollution deep underground has always been a tantalizing possibility for tackling climate change. It just. .. never seems to go anywhere. In the US, the technology has gotten a reputation as an awful boondoggle, especially after a major project to demonstrate coal with carbon capture in Kemper, Mississippi turned into a fiasco. Thanks to endless delays and overruns, Kemper now costs three times its original $2. 2 billion price tag, leading many to write off the whole concept.",
        "Here\u2019s something everyone knows: Social media is driving American politics into a ditch of partisanship. Political junkies log on and cocoon themselves in a bubble of friendly punditry, appealing fake news, and outrageous acts from the other side. Every retweet and every like is another moment of identity confirmation, another high five to our friends, another reminder that we\u2019re right and they\u2019re wrong.",
        "For years, Donald Trump has been fixated on taking China to task for manipulating its currency in order to give its goods an edge over competitors in global markets. He complained about it back in 2013 when he was a private citizen, and on the campaign trail he constantly vowed that he would put an end to it. \u201dOn day one of a Trump administration, the US Treasury Department will designate China a currency manipulator,\u201d he wrote in a Wall Street Journal in 2015.",
        "A little less than a week ago, I wrote that the knives were out for White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who was said to be clashing with other top administration officials, losing the president\u2019s favor, and potentially on his way out of the administration. On Tuesday, those reports were confirmed by the source possible \u2014 President Donald Trump himself. In an interview, the New York Post\u2019s Michael Goodwin asked Trump if he still had confidence in Bannon, and, Goodwin writes, \u201cI did not get a definitive yes. \u201d Far from it.",
        "Chicago Public Schools has a new requirement for its 435, 000 students: To graduate, they must prove they have a plan. That means a college acceptance letter, a job offer, military orders, or enrollment in a job training program. The idea of making students go through an extra hurdle to graduate sparked some criticism in the press when it was first reported last week, especially because Chicago schools already have a graduation rate. Some critics worried that the new requirement would hold back students who are already struggling to pass their classes.",

        "President Donald Trump recounted an absolutely astounding detail about one of his conversations with Chinese President Xi Jinping in comments published by the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday afternoon. Apparently, Trump came into his first meeting with the Chinese leader, in early April, convinced that China could simply eliminate the threat posed by North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. Xi then patiently explained history to Trump \u2014 who then promptly changed his mind. \u201cAfter listening for 10 minutes, I realized it\u2019s not so easy,\u201d the president told the Journal.",
        "After several years of the worst drought on record, California deserts are in bloom \u2014 and wildflowers are exploding across the harsh landscapes. Hundreds of species of wildflowers typically blanket California deserts between March and July \u2014 from Joshua Tree and Death Valley in the south to Carrizo Plain National Monument on the central coast. But the bloom is largely dependent on rainfall. And during the worst of the California drought, blossoms were sparse. In 2015, California finally got heavy rainfall again, leading to the \u201csuper bloom\u201d of 2016, which was especially spectacular in Death Valley National Park.",

The big political news last night was the Kansas special election in the state\u2019s Fourth Congressional District, where Republicans kept a seat they\u2019ve held for 20 years \u2014 but by such a narrow margin that it\u2019s surely giving other Republicans the jitters.",
        "Skeptics of Trumpworld\u2019s ties to Russia should take note: The Justice Department and the FBI took links between one of Trump\u2019s advisers and Russia so seriously last summer that they successfully obtained a secret court order to monitor his communications. According to a Washington Post report published Tuesday, the FBI and the DOJ obtained a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant last summer to surveil Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page on the grounds that he could be covertly working on behalf of the Russian government.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s second of three campaign chiefs, Paul Manafort, announced through a spokesperson today that he is planning to formally register as a foreign agent. Manafort has worked, in one capacity or other, for foreign politicians since at least his advocacy on behalf of Angolan guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi, a onetime Maoist who was trying to rebrand himself as a freedom fighter for the Reagan era. Foreign agent registration means, in essence, that you are an official lobbyist for a foreign government \u2014 there are well over 1, 000 registered foreign agents in Washington.",
        "Sean Spicer shocked many when he falsely claimed on Tuesday that \u201dHitler didn\u2019t even sink to the level of using chemical weapons\u201d during World War II. In normal times, it would probably have been enough to end the career of a spokesperson. But, we are continually reminded, these are not normal times. Trump and his people are far too familiar with gaffes involving the Holocaust. Spicer\u2019s Tuesday comments are but the latest in a series of dog whistles and Holocaust denials emanating from the president, his staff, and his family.",
        "Last week, Republicans in the Senate invoked the \u201cnuclear option,\u201d which immediately allowed President Trump\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, to be confirmed with a simple majority of the votes, rather than the previous threshold. But what about the impact of the rule change? As Vox\u2019s Jeff Stein noted, that senators have used such apocalyptic rhetoric to describe this rule change shows how important institutional procedure is to many of them. \u201cThis is a body blow to the institution,\u201d Sen. John McCain ( ) told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cI think we\u2019re on a slippery slope.",
        "When The Fast and the Furious opened in the summer of 2001, few would have predicted that it would launch one of Hollywood\u2019s biggest franchises. A modestly budgeted action picture built around urban street racing culture that borrowed heavily from Point Break, the film turned into a surprise hit, earning a total of $207 million at the box office, with about $144 million coming from domestic ticket sales, on a $38 million production budget. Sixteen years later, the series has become more of a behemoth than even that initial success would have suggested.",
        "Google is facing an intensive investigation from the Department of Labor over alleged pay discrimination. A Labor Department official made news on Friday when she testified in court that \u201cwe found systemic compensation disparities against women\u201d at the search giant. In a comment to the Guardian, another Labor Department spokesperson stated that \u201cthe government\u2019s analysis at this point indicates that discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme.",

        "You can hear someone\u2019s age in their voice. That\u2019s the point that voice actor Phil LaMarr illustrates in a new episode of Vox critic at large Todd VanDerWerff\u2019s podcast, I Think You\u2019re Interesting. LaMarr, whose voice you\u2019d recognize as Futurama\u2019s Hermes Conrad and Justice League\u2019s John Stewart, among many other voice roles, was speaking in this case about the new season of his show Samurai Jack. The new season of Jack premiered on March 11, 2017, a decade and change after the show ended its fourth season in September 2004."
