        "There was a time when I had seen but one and a half movies in the Fast & Furious franchise. I had always been skeptical of the films\u2019 powers, perhaps because I had only seen 2 Fast 2 Furious (easily the worst installment) and Fast Five \u2014 without sound, while on a plane (still pretty awesome). Then I watched the first seven of them in a week. That experience made me not just a convert, but an evangelist.",
        "The state of Arkansas is racing to kill eight people as quickly as possible. This month, Arkansas planned to execute eight convicted murderers in just 11 days. Don Davis and Bruce Ward were to be executed on April 17, Ledell Lee and Stacey Johnson on April 20, Marcel Williams and Jack Jones on April 24, and Kenneth Williams and Jason McGehee on April 27. But over the past several weeks, multiple court rulings have put the executions on hold.",
        "If you believe Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly, he\u2019s just going on a preplanned vacation. But if you look at the swirling disaster around him, this could be the end for The O\u2019Reilly Factor. O\u2019Reilly on Tuesday announced a vacation until April 24. A spokesperson for O\u2019Reilly told Variety that this was planned for months: \u201cThe arrangements, including airline and hotel reservations, for this vacation were made last October. The vacation involves a group of people, and the timing coincides with the period Mr. O\u2019Reilly often takes off in and around his children\u2019s spring break.",
        "When author and civil rights lawyer Alia Malek woke up to the images of Syrians dying from a chemical weapons attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun last week, her immediate response was pain, anger, and frustration. \u201cBut at the same time,\u201d Malek told me, \u201cthere have been so many mornings like that in the last six years. \u201d Since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, more than 5 million Syrians have become refugees. Moreover, at least 470, 000 Syrians have died, the vast majority by methods other than chemical weapons.",
        "Rains often spell trouble for Latin America. This month, more than 300 people died in a mudslide in Mocoa, Colombia. In March, flooding killed at least 95 people in Peru, left 700, 000 homeless, and caused severe property damage in Lima, a city built on a desert. While the weather pattern \u2014 linked to a localized, version of El Ni\u00f1o \u2014 is abnormal, the human costs were predictable. For centuries, Latin Americans have built housing without land titles or zoning approval.",
        "\u201dDon\u2019t pester, Ramona,\u201d said Mrs. Quimby. \u201dI\u2019ll get you there in plenty of time.\u201d \u201dI\u2019m not pestering,\u201d protested Ramona, who never meant to pester. She was not a slowpoke grownup. She was a girl who could not wait. Life was so interesting that she had to find out what happened next. Ramona Quimby was not meant to be a main character, not at first. She first appeared as a minor character in Beverly Cleary\u2019s Henry Huggins books. \u201dIt occurred to me that all the children appeared to be only children,\u201d recalls Cleary, who turns 101 on April 12.",
        "Some Republicans around Washington are floating an audacious idea: repealing the payroll taxes that fund Social Security as part of a forthcoming tax reform bill. It\u2019s a proposal that, even if it doesn\u2019t cut the program\u2019s funding right now, could have aftershocks for one of the pillars of America\u2019s social compact. We are in the trial balloon phase of tax reform. A lot of ideas are going to pop up in press reports in the coming months, and many or most of them won\u2019t actually end up in whatever legislation the Trump White House and Congress actually propose.",
        "\u201cWe see these beautiful pictures at night from the decks of these two US Navy vessels in the eastern Mediterranean \u2026 I am tempted to quote the great Leonard Cohen: \u2018I am guided by the beauty of our weapons. \u2019\u201d These words were uttered by MSNBC anchor Brian Williams on Thursday night. Williams, who was suspended two years ago for lying on air about being shot down in Iraq, was describing the recent missile strikes in Syria.",
        "Every week, some of Vox\u2019s writers will gather to discuss the latest episode of FX\u2019s spy drama The Americans. This week, deputy culture editor Genevieve Koski and staff writers Caroline Framke and Dara Lind take on \u201cCrossbreed,\u201d the sixth episode of season five. Caroline Framke: The Americans has never let anyone run too far from their past without letting that past catch up to them eventually. Even if they think they\u2019ve buried that shit deep, it always finds a way to bubble up, to catch them off guard.",
        "Something extraordinary happened in cities across Russia yesterday. It has been, in my mind, a turning point in the history of our country. Tens of thousands of Russians, both liberal and conservative, poured into the city streets yesterday and in April to protest the regime of Vladimir Putin. Over a thousand people were arrested. People put their bodies on the line to say they are ready for change in Russia. I walked the streets of Moscow with them.",
        "\u201cWe don\u2019t believe you, \u2019cause we the people Are still here in the rear, ayo, we don\u2019t need you,\u201d raps on A Tribe Called Quests\u2019s 2016 track \u201cWe The People,\u201d an opening verse aimed straight at a flawed America. As the song goes on, it calls out specific social problems in the US \u2014 discrimination, unequal pay, deportation. It\u2019s a protest song through and through. A Tribe Called Quest isn\u2019t the only band making protest music right now, nor is it the first. Far from it.",
        "\u201cIf there were an emperor of progressive Democrats, Howard Dean would be the man \u2014 except of course his fellow Vermonter, Sanders, is now that man,\u201d Ben Sarle wrote for the Atlantic last year. Certainly it\u2019s hard to imagine the unexpected success of Bernie Sanders\u2019s and Barack Obama\u2019s campaigns without Dean\u2019s insurgent \u201904 presidential run. Dean inspired thousands of new youth organizers, pioneered the use of digital technologies for political campaigns, and amassed sizable funds through many modest donations.",
        "Republicans survived a scare in Kansas\u2019s Fourth Congressional District on Tuesday night, winning a deeply conservative district that was starting to look like it might slip into Democratic control at the last minute. Republican Ron Estes, the state\u2019s treasurer, defeated civil rights attorney and Democrat Jim Thompson, according to the Associated Press. As of around 10:45 pm, Estes was ahead by about 8 points. The outcome does not radically alter the composition of power in Washington. Right now, Republicans control 238 seats to Democrats\u2019 194; a switch, obviously, wouldn\u2019t do much to loosen that majority.",
        "In the span of one week, President Donald Trump has completely abandoned nearly half a dozen major pledges on US foreign policy that he made during his campaign. As the new president is confronted by new and complex policy challenges and infighting among adviser factions within the White House, he\u2019s pulling reversals on a host of pivotal stances that are, on the whole, making his engagement with foreign affairs far more conventional than he once promised.",
        "Last year, Alaska\u2019s Obamacare marketplaces seemed on the verge of implosion. Premiums for individual health insurance plans were set to rise 42 percent. State officials worried that they were on the verge of a \u201cdeath spiral,\u201d where only the sickest people buy coverage and cause rates to skyrocket year after year. So the state tried something new and different \u2014 and it worked. Lori Alaska\u2019s insurance commissioner, put together a plan that had the state pay back insurers for especially high medical claims submitted to Obamacare plans. This lowered premiums for everyone.",
        "The US military has just dropped a big bomb in Afghanistan. The Massive Ordnance Air Blast, also called the \u201cmother of all bombs\u201d or MOAB for short, is the largest bomb ever used by the US military on the battlefield. The weapon was first tested in 2003 but had never been used in combat prior to Thursday \u2014 when a US aircraft dropped one on what it claims was a network of ISIS tunnels. 36 ISIS fighters were killed, according to the Afghan government, and the US military has not found any evidence of civilian casualties.",
        "Steve Bannon, the mercurial mastermind behind Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, has come under fire in recent weeks. Bannon, now serving as chief presidential strategist, has openly feuded with Trump\u2019s senior adviser (and ) Jared Kushner. Tensions, reportedly, have reached a tipping point, and Bannon may be close to losing his job. If Trump does decide to part ways with Bannon, however, he might pay a steep political price. Bannon is a and a very one at that. His influence will not end at the doors of the White House.",
        "Survivor player Zeke Smith is a welcome shot of enthusiastic, wickedly smart energy on the show. He proved to be a sly force of nature throughout season 33\u2019s Millennials vs. Gen X edition, winning allies with savvy gameplay and a wide grin. And on season 34\u2019s Game Changers \u2014 which is currently airing and pits some of Survivor\u2019s most interesting experienced players against one another \u2014 Zeke has been strategic, focused, and giddy as hell to be playing a game he loves with players he\u2019s watched for years. Zeke is also transgender.",
        "Canada wants to legalize marijuana \u2014 and it may be willing to break international law to do it. On Thursday, the ruling Liberal Party in the Canadian Parliament introduced a bill that would legalize marijuana for recreational purposes. It would be the first developed country in the world to fully legalize pot since the international war on drugs began in the 1970s. The bill will set the minimum age for purchasing marijuana at 18, although provinces could raise the age within their borders. The federal government will handle licensing producers, while provincial governments will manage distribution and retail sales.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s long, improbable journey to political power has been marked by a nearly endless procession of fallacious media conceits. The latest of these posits that the apparent downfall of chief strategist Steve Bannon, driven by personality clashes with Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump and substantive policy disagreements with National Economic Council chief Gary Cohn, mark the dawn of a new, more \u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201ccentrist\u201d version of Trumpism. The truth is closer to the opposite. Bannon himself was no prize pig, and the country is in many ways better off with his influence diminished. But the emerging Trumpism 2.",
        "\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be the person who messed up the new David Fincher movie,\u201d Carrie Coon tells me. She\u2019s recalling a moment early in her career \u2014 a moment that came just four years ago, in 2013, which seems rather remarkable for someone who is now playing the lead female role on two separate TV shows debuting new seasons within days of each other. Before landing the part of Margo (the main character\u2019s sister) in Fincher\u2019s Gone Girl, Coon had played a couple of small parts in films.",

        "A Quiet Passion is a perplexing and challenging film, crafted without the traditional guardrails that guide most biographical movies \u2014 dates, times, major accomplishments, etc. Time slips away in the film almost imperceptibly, and the narrative arc doesn\u2019t yield easily to the viewer. Cynthia Nixon plays Emily Dickinson, whose poetry and life is a perfect match for the signature style of director Terence Davies: rich in detail, deeply enigmatic, and weighed down with a kind of sparkling, sorrow.",
        "This week, NASA announced some exciting new findings about \u201coceans beyond Earth. \u201d The gist: The space agency has found the most compelling evidence yet that the ocean underneath the icy crust of Enceladus, Saturn\u2019s moon, could contain life. In the past, the Cassini spacecraft has observed jets of water containing organic chemicals streaming from Enceladus. This latest finding adds a key ingredient for life to the mix: hydrogen. The presence of hydrogen in the jets makes NASA scientists suspect there are geothermal geysers on Enceladus\u2019s ocean floor.",

        "White House press secretary Sean Spicer\u2019s shockingly ignorant claim during a Tuesday press conference that \u201dHitler didn\u2019t even sink to the level of using chemical weapons\u201d during World War II drew swift condemnation from a number of Jewish groups, as did his clumsy attempts to clarify what he meant. The Anne Frank Center, for instance, accused Spicer of \u201cHolocaust denial\u201d and called on President Trump to fire him immediately. The League, however, has decided to take a slightly different tack: offering to hold one of its Holocaust education classes for Spicer and others in the White House.",
        "Here\u2019s a simple question: How many Americans don\u2019t believe in God? Pew and Gallup \u2014 two of the most reputable polling firms in America \u2014 both come to a similar figure. About 10 percent of Americans say they do not believe in God, and this figure has been slowly creeping up over the decades. But maybe this isn\u2019t the whole story. University of Kentucky psychologists Will Gervais and Maxine Najle have long suspected that a lot of atheists aren\u2019t showing up in these polls.",
        "If you were a world leader, how would White House press secretary Sean Spicer pronounce your name? Spicer has been known to slip up and mispronounce the names of many heads of state in press briefings and live TV interviews. Now you can find out how he might garble your name too, thanks to an online widget created by Australia\u2019s Sydney Morning Herald newspaper. Type in your name and it will be magically \u201cSpicerized,\u201d morphed into something vaguely similar to, but completely different from, your name.",
        "In the third episode of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Hulu\u2019s extraordinary new adaptation of Margaret Atwood\u2019s enduring 1985 dystopian novel, women throughout the United States take to the streets, marching to make their voices heard. They\u2019re protesting the rise of an authoritarian religious conservative state, one that has stripped them of many of their rights and promises to strip them of more. Among their number is our hero, played by Mad Men\u2019s Elisabeth Moss, who shouts and pushes back, even as the police arrive and meet the protest with violence. Then the explosions ring out, and chaos unfolds.",

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio described a associate judge on New York\u2019s highest court, as a \u201chumble pioneer. \u201d When she was appointed to the New York State Court of Appeals, according to the New York Times, she was the first black woman to have held the position."
