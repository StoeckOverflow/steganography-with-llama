        "Going into The Fate of the Furious, the Fast & Furious franchise is riding high: Each installment has been more profitable than the last \u2014 a trend the new movie continued with a take of over half a billion dollars globally in its first weekend. And the franchise\u2019s success goes beyond gains: The series has reached new creative peaks with every release since director Justin Lin helped reroute things with 2009\u2019s Fast & Furious. It\u2019s become a bona fide phenomenon, and expectations were high that the eighth film would continue the series\u2019 upward trajectory.",
        "\u201cThe Middle East is one big, fat quagmire,\u201d Donald Trump said in a November 2015 GOP primary debate. Flash forward to April 2017. President Trump has just ordered the US military to bomb Bashar \u2019s forces for the first time. His deputies have suggested that the administration would consider more bombings if Assad uses chemical weapons again. The Trump administration has also ramped up US military activity in Yemen, dropping more bombs in one week in March than Obama did in all of 2016.",
        "President Donald Trump has made it explicit: He is taking Obamacare hostage to try to force Democrats to work with him on health care reform. The president has a real basis for the threat. A lawsuit working its way through the courts right now threatens crucial subsidies that help lower costs for millions of people who bought their insurance through Obamacare. Those subsidies are known as reductions. The Obama administration had been defending the subsidies, but Trump could choose to end them. This could throw the insurance market into chaos. Health insurers are already nervous about that possibility.",
        "Sometimes a clarification of a mistake is even more damning than the mistake itself. White House press secretary Sean Spicer declared this week, in an attempt to show that Syrian President Bashar is worse than Hitler, that Hitler \u201ddidn\u2019t even sink to the level of using chemical weapons. \u201d Given the obvious fact that Hitler did in fact use chemical weapons \u2014 a large share of Holocaust victims were gassed \u2014 Spicer clarified. \u201cHe was not using the gas on his own people,\u201d he said.",
        "Early on in The Lost City of Z, our hero, Percy Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam) is described with thinly veiled disdain by one older fellow to another as having been \u201crather unfortunate in his choice of ancestors. \u201d Fawcett\u2019s father pissed away the family fortune; so, as a young man and the only undecorated officer in his military regiment, Percy aims to regain his family\u2019s honor. That aim ultimately drives him straight into the jungle. He\u2019s assigned to join a major expedition sponsored by the Royal Geographical Society \u2014 a dangerous journey to map Bolivia and establish its borders.",
        "Democratic Party leaders, stung by criticism for having done so little to help their candidate in an unexpectedly narrow House special election in Kansas, have swiftly converged on an explanation for their actions. They\u2019re now arguing it wasn\u2019t a mistake \u2014 they didn\u2019t just underrate how much Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback\u2019s unpopularity would matter, or overrate how good state Treasurer Sam Estes, the Republican who ultimately won, was as a candidate. No, they argue, staying largely out of the race was a strategy.",
        "Much attention has been paid to flying delivery robot prototypes from Amazon and Google, but a San Francisco startup called Marble just released a product that \u2014 while a bit less futuristic \u2014 could turn out to win the robot delivery wars. Marble has built a fleet of robots that are now doing food deliveries in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District. The robots do the same job as human delivery people: They roll to a restaurant, pick up the food, and then roll along sidewalks to the customer.",

Every year, LLNL produces a new energy flow chart showing the sources of US energy, what it\u2019s used for, and how much of it is wasted. If you\u2019ve never seen it before, it\u2019s a bit of a . Behold US energy in 2016: So much information in so little space!",
        "It\u2019s worth taking a step back to realize just how broken the process for selecting Supreme Court justices now is. In 2016, Senate Republicans responded to Antonin Scalia\u2019s death by inventing and establishing the absurd faux principle that open seats on the Supreme Court cannot be filled in an election year. Given that America hosts national elections one out of every two years, that means, in theory, that Supreme Court seats should remain unfilled fully 50 percent of the time. But it gets worse.",
        "For weeks, White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has been locked in combat with another faction of administration officials \u2014 and both Bannon\u2019s job and the future of the Trump administration may be at stake. Bannon\u2019s rivals, led by senior White House adviser and presidential Jared Kushner and former Goldman Sachs president Gary Cohn \u2014 and with the crucial backing of President Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka \u2014 are an informal group of aides that has been pushing for the administration to take a more turn. Which means less of Steve Bannon, the outsider.",
        "A damaged and dour Luke Skywalker. Rey training with her lightsaber on a rocky bluff. An epic space battle. A retaliation against the Resistance from the First Order. Those images, among others in the first official trailer for Star Wars: Episode VIII \u2014 The Last Jedi, suggest that Rian Johnson\u2019s sequel will have a darker, more somber feel than 2015\u2019s The Force Awakens, just like The Empire Strikes Back had in comparison with the original movie.",

        "This is how the Beltway establishment, Republicans and Democrats alike, think about American foreign policy: America\u2019s role is to lead the world. Be it under the slogan of America\u2019s \u201cbenevolent global hegemony,\u201d the neoconservative version, or \u201cthe indispensable nation,\u201d the neoliberal variant, the party in power scarcely matters. Anything that happens across the globe is potentially a critical American concern. Except for Donald Trump. When he launched his 2016 presidential bid, Trump drew from the central message of thought: America was not imbued with a unique moral innocence in foreign policy. Many of our interventions have had terrible results.",

        "As a young boy, I remember accompanying my parents to visit their accountant and seeing them turn over large folders, neatly organized, with all of their tax forms and corresponding documents. My mother would tell me her priority was to show the government our family was contributing, so that when it came time to become legal permanent residents, and later US citizens, there would be no questions about our contributions to the country. I have lived in the United States for the past 17 years, half of that time as an undocumented immigrant.",
        "The biggest question plaguing HBO\u2019s political comedy Veep right now is how the hell it\u2019s going to continue finding hyperbolic comedy in the dysfunction of American politics, when the equivalent keeps devolving into unprecedented chaos. After seeing three episodes of the show\u2019s sixth season, which debuts Sunday, April 16, I can safely say the answer seems to be that it\u2019s not even going to try. Now that Julia \u2019s Selina Meyer is no longer the president, Veep no longer has an organic reason to keep mimicking Capitol Hill politics.",
        "Americans\u2019 top concern about the tax code is that they want corporations and wealthy individuals to pay more taxes. Even among Republicans, soaking the rich is at least moderately popular. That\u2019s according to a new report out from the Pew Center that takes a deep dive into public opinion on taxes. It reveals that there is extraordinarily little public support for the main thrust of GOP tax reform efforts that aim to \u201csimplify\u201d the tax code and deliver lower rates for businesses and households. Not only does this agenda have little public support, it\u2019s also divisive.",
        "The Force is with us again: The first trailer for Star Wars: Episode VIII \u2014 The Last Jedi made its debut on Friday at Star Wars Celebration 2017. We get to see Rey (Daisy Ridley) undergo training and wield a lightsaber. We witness what looks to be an attack on the Resistance. And we hear Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) utter an ominous sentence: \u201cIt\u2019s time for the Jedi to \u2026 end. \u201d The Last Jedi, directed by Rian Johnson, is the to 2015\u2019s Star Wars: Episode VII \u2014 The Force Awakens.

        "The smartest move the commercial airline industry ever made was to convince consumers to pay extra for what used to be the minimum. It\u2019s even got a name: \u201ccalculated misery. \u201d \u201cCalculated misery\u201d sounds like a movie featuring a revenge plot \u2014 one that involves social media and tears of frustration. Instead, it\u2019s the concept that there\u2019s money to be made by making an experience so awful that a customer will want to avoid it. And not only is it sinister, it\u2019s profitable \u2014 at least when it comes to air travel.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s election win, many speculated, must be due to geographic inequality and the increasing concentration of economic activity in a handful of big coastal cities. It was tough to escape the woeful tales of and Rust Belt voters in the final months of 2016. But as Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed. com, pointed out last September, the economy isn\u2019t actually becoming more concentrated. Something much more insidious is happening. Economic opportunity is becoming more concentrated, but Americans\u2019 ability to move to take advantage of that opportunity is declining.",
        "It was a bad week for . The hodgepodge group of libertarians, pacifists, and paleocons had, for the part, latched onto Donald Trump\u2019s campaign as a vehicle to smash the stranglehold of neoconservatives on the GOP and advance a foreign policy: no more wars in the Middle East, no interventions in the name of democracy or human rights or vengeance. Trump became their man, when, in the midst of the Republican primaries, he did the unthinkable: He called Iraq \u201ca disaster\u201d and \u201ca horrible mistake,\u201d then accused the Bush administration of lying about weapons of mass destruction.",
        "A Democrat with virtually no support from the national party came shockingly close to pulling off an upset in a deeply conservative House district in Kansas this week. The party has instead thrown its financial heft behind former Democratic Hill aide Jon Ossoff for a special election in Georgia\u2019s Sixth District on Tuesday \u2014 a district that Donald Trump only won by one point and that national Democrats have made their key election target of the early Trump administration. A crowded field of Republican candidates in the race also bolsters Ossoff\u2019s chances in the wealthy Atlanta suburbs.",
        "A majority of Democratic voters don\u2019t see eye to eye with their party\u2019s leaders on Capitol Hill over President Donald Trump\u2019s strikes in Syria. A new poll released by Gallup on Wednesday found that 61 percent of Democrats nationally opposed the strikes, with just 33 percent expressing their approval. (The remaining 6 percent said they weren\u2019t sure.) By contrast, only five Democratic senators have come out in opposition to the attacks, according to a tally compiled by FiveThirtyEight. The Democrat, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( ) called punishing Syria\u2019s Bashar \u201cthe right thing to do.",

Reaching speeds of more than 200 miles per hour, peregrine falcons can dive faster than a moving Formula One race car. Peregrine falcons can be found on every continent except Antarctica. They\u2019re a type of raptor or bird of prey, which hunts other animals for food.",
        "The greatest trick The Leftovers ever pulled was getting audiences to stop thinking about what had happened to the Departed, the 2 percent of the world\u2019s population who simply disappeared one October day in the series\u2019 universe. Rating This was no easy feat! Damon Lindelof, who the series with Tom Perrotta, the author of the novel the show was based on, was previously most famous for Lost, a series known for asking big questions that weren\u2019t always answered to viewers\u2019 satisfaction.

        "In a refurbished bank building in Wilmington, Delaware, there\u2019s a small classroom. It has a projector, neon posters on the wall, and several tables with pairs of plastic model uteruses scattered across them. A dozen or so clinicians have come here to learn how best to insert IUDs into these uteruses. Once they\u2019ve practiced on the models at their desks, they can try out a more model in the back. It\u2019s a robotic replica of the female pelvic area, complete with a vagina, cervix, and uterus, that groans in pain when an IUD is inserted incorrectly.",
        "When I first heard that Joel Hodgson wanted not only to revive his most famous creation, the \u201ctalking back to the movies\u201d TV show Mystery Science Theater 3000, but to revive it with an cast, the only reaction I could muster was scoffing disbelief. The original series, which ran from 1988 until 1999 on several different networks, did switch out its host and the voices of its robot puppets over the course of its run. But that happened gradually."
