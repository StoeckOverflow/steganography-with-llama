        "Melissa McCarthy is due to host Saturday Night Live in under a month, but that was too long a wait for her Sean Spicer to return to the show. In fact, McCarthy filmed her third appearance as Spicer in this week\u2019s sketch not from SNL\u2019s Studio H in New York City, but from a set all the way in Los Angeles (where, for the first time ever, SNL was airing live simultaneously with its East Coast airing).",
        "Doctor Who is back, and with him, a new companion in Pearl Mackie\u2019s effervescent Bill Potts. Meeting a new Doctor Who companion is like ordering a new drink at your regular bar. Your surroundings will look about the same, but there\u2019s an intriguing sense of possibility in a kooky bartender trying to sell you on an exciting specialty cocktail or expound on how \u201cthe passage of time\u2019s an illusion and life\u2019s the magician.",
        "This week, Whitney Cummings \u2014 comedian, actress, creator and star of the NBC sitcom Whitney, and part of the upcoming film Unforgettable \u2014 answers our questions. What\u2019s the first piece of media you consume every day? I\u2019m on a couple text chains with comedians, so I wake up to news in the form of offensive memes, which is oddly less offensive than the actual news. Am I supposed to put the word news in quotes now? Name a writer or publication you disagree with but still read. My twitter @replies.",
        "Every weekend, we pick a movie you can stream that dovetails with current events. Old, new, blockbuster, arthouse: They\u2019re all fair game. What you can count on is a weekend watch that sheds new light on the week that was. The movie of the week for April 15 through 21 is The Ten Commandments, which is available to digitally rent on Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, YouTube, and Vudu.",
        "As his parting line in the first episode of the Doctor Who spinoff Class, the Twelfth Doctor delivers the equivalent of a dad joke. He warns the students he\u2019s leaving behind at the notorious Coal Hill Academy, the site of many a minor plot point throughout the Whoniverse, that the dangers they\u2019re about to face will be roughly on par with their ridiculously difficult final exams \u2014 but much harder than \u201cmedia studies. \u201d It\u2019s one of many awkward meta moments throughout the series, whose attempts to wink at its status as a geeky teen never quite land.",
        "Welcome back to Vox\u2019s weekly book link roundup, a curated selection of the week\u2019s best writing on books and related subjects. Here is the best the internet has to offer for the week of April 9, 2017.",
        "Every Sunday, we pick a new episode of the week. It could be good. It could be bad. It will always be interesting. You can read the archives here. The episode of the week for April 8 through 15 is \u201cMinty,\u201d the sixth episode of season two of WGN\u2019s Underground. Letting a single character take center stage to talk for a full hour, with next to no interruptions, sounds like a surefire way to make a television audience tune out.",
        "It\u2019s been a scary few days on the Korean Peninsula. In just the past two days, North Korea\u2019s reclusive government has held a massive military parade, flubbed a missile test, and threatened nuclear war with the US. Meanwhile, the Trump administration, which recently ordered the US Navy to deploy an aircraft carrier strike group to the waters off North Korea, sent Vice President Mike Pence to the North Korean border to warn that Washington\u2019s era of \u201cstrategic patience\u201d toward the North had ended \u2014 a comment many interpreted as a veiled military threat to Pyongyang.",
        "Donald Trump doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. This became clear when he said he realized dealing with North Korea was \u201cnot so easy\u201d after 10 minutes with the Chinese president. Dealing with complicated problems is an occupational hazard faced by outsiders in all fields \u2014 and there\u2019s never been a president who is more of an outsider to the realm of public policy. Consequently, a lot of his assertions about critical matters of public concern are based on . .. nothing at all.",
        "The most interesting policy argument in America right now is the debate between conservatives\u2019 real position on health care and their fake position. The fake, but popular, position goes something like this: Conservatives think everyone deserves affordable health insurance, but they disagree with Democrats about how to get everyone covered at the best price. This was the language that surrounded Paul Ryan and Donald Trump\u2019s Obamacare alternative \u2014 an alternative that crashed and burned when it came clear that it would lead to more people with worse (or no) health insurance and higher medical bills.",
        "Andy Crouch knows that he and his wife, Catherine, raised their kids in an unusual way. He calls it \u201cradical. \u201d They set strict boundaries around technology: no devices in the car. They can check their children\u2019s devices at any time, for any reason. And before his children turned 10, they weren\u2019t allowed to use screens at all. The goal, according to Crouch, wasn\u2019t to deprive his kids of technology. Crouch is a \u201ctechnophile\u201d who\u2019s owned nearly every gadget Apple has made.",
        "Markets are very optimistic about Tesla\u2019s future \u2014 so optimistic that it would be impossible to explain if Tesla were a conventional car company. On paper, Tesla shouldn\u2019t be worth anywhere near as much as rivals like Ford and GM. Ford sold 6. 6 million cars in 2016. GM sold 10 million. Tesla sold a paltry 76, 000. Ford and GM both turned healthy profits in 2016. Tesla lost money. Yet earlier this month Tesla\u2019s market value surged past Ford and then briefly eclipsed GM as America\u2019s most valuable carmaker.",
        "ISTANBUL \u2014 Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has publicly feuded with the US, likened the German government to Nazis, jailed more journalists than any other leader in the world, and arrested tens of thousands of his own people on suspect charges. Now a slim majority of Turkish voters have just approved constitutional changes designed to make the strongman even stronger. In a referendum vote on Sunday, Turks gave Erdo\u011fan considerable new powers while leaving him subject to few, if any, meaningful checks and balances.",
        "The election of Donald Trump was a major shock to the left. It was not supposed to happen. It was not even supposed to be possible for it to happen. Many shuffle about their daily tasks suffused in gloom and pessimism. With Trump in the White House, and the Republicans in control of Congress and most states, surely little of the progressive agenda will remain in a few years. His brand of xenophobia and authoritarianism is on the ascent; the future looks bleak both for the country and a world torn by rising populism and threatened by climate change.",

White House staff huddles on key Obamacare payments Multiple sources tell me that White House staff held a meeting today to discuss reduction subsidies \u2014 that $8 billion Obamacare program whose fate still hangs in limbo. Ending these payments could \u201dblow up\u201d the health law\u2019s marketplaces, but President Trump has so far waffled on what he\u2019ll do about the issue.",
        "During President Donald Trump\u2019s first 12 weeks in office, he\u2019s struggled to deliver on many of his campaign promises \u2014 but just as he said he would, he\u2019s making enforcement of immigration law much harsher. On this episode of The Weeds, Matt Yglesias and Sarah Kliff are joined by Vox immigration reporter Dara Lind to talk through the changes the Trump administration has already made to immigration policy and what developments we can expect in the near future.",
        "Congressional Republicans have little reason to fear backlash from their own base if they defy President Trump on select policy issues. That\u2019s the clear message of a new Pew poll, which shows that a slight majority of conservative Republicans say they are okay with GOP members of Congress bucking Trump, and an even larger majority of moderate Republicans agree. Overall, 55 percent of Republicans and independents say it is fine to break with Trump. This question of an obligation to side with Trump came up most concretely in the abortive effort to pass the American Health Care Act.",

This and other marvels are the result of machine learning. These are programs that comb through millions of pieces of data and start making correlations and predictions about the world. The appeal of these programs is immense: These machines can use cold, hard data to make decisions that are sometimes more accurate than a human\u2019s. But know: Machine learning has a dark side.",
        "Last Week Tonight host John Oliver had a message Sunday night for the French: America and Britain failed to stop the rise of populism in their countries \u2014 don\u2019t be the third. \u201cBritain and America fucked up. Don\u2019t fuck up too,\u201d he implored the French voting public, which goes to the polls this Sunday, April 23, in the first round of voting to elect a new president.",
        "As President Donald Trump nears the end of his third month in office, it\u2019s clear his approval ratings aren\u2019t looking so great. But a new Pew Research Center report provides a useful reminder of just how bad Trump\u2019s numbers are for a new president in particular. This chart shows the most recent six presidents\u2019 approval ratings in their early months in office.",
        "United Airlines had a catastrophic past week. After a man was violently dragged off one of its planes to make room for a United crew member who needed his seat, the airline issued a for the man\u2019s injuries and suffered a massive loss in the stock market. Then, on a different United flight, a man was stung by a scorpion that dropped out of a plane\u2019s overhead bin. And the American people have taken note.",
        "The Leftovers, HBO\u2019s critically acclaimed drama, premiered its third and final season on Easter Sunday, April 16, with \u201cThe Book of Kevin. \u201d Below, Vox Culture writers Caroline Framke and Alissa Wilkinson discuss the episode in full \u2014 so beware, there are spoilers here, and lots of \u2019em. Caroline Framke: It feels fitting that this final season premiere doubles down on the fact that no one in The Leftovers\u2019 whole damn world is ever going to \u2014 as season two\u2019s plucky theme song by Iris DeMent suggests \u2014 just \u201clet the mystery be.",
        "President Trump will participate in the White House Easter Egg Roll, the 139th iteration of the annual tradition, on Monday morning. Yet even something as light as the Easter celebration for kids has become a sort of mini controversy for Trump, as a recent New York Times report detailed a planning effort behind on its organizational and staffing requirements. Some contractors went so far as to take to the president\u2019s favorite medium of Twitter to remind him of important dates: @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @MELANIATRUMP @IvankaTrump FYI manufacturing deadlines for the Easter eggs are near. Please reach out! pic. twitter.",
        "President Trump has directed much of his shtick at CNN over the past few months, publicly attacking the network for its coverage of his administration. But the truth is, a lot of the feud between Trump and CNN is theater. CNN has played an important role in mainstreaming and normalizing Trump\u2019s misinformation, thanks in large part to the small army of Trump surrogates the network has hired to defend the president during panel debates.",
        "Just over a week before the first round of French presidential elections are scheduled, the messy field of 11 contenders was jolted by a sudden surge in poll numbers for a populist candidate named M\u00e9lenchon, whose policies are so liberal they make Bernie Sanders look like a . A fan of Hugo Chavez, M\u00e9lenchon wants to impose a 100 percent tax on those who earn above \u20ac400, 000 \u2014 effectively a salary cap \u2014 and channel that money into public spending on things like poverty reduction and job creation.",
        "Labor unions in America are in crisis. In the a third of Americans belonged to a labor union. Today only 10. 7 percent do, including a minuscule 6. 4 percent of private sector workers. The decline of union membership explains as much as a third of the increase in inequality in the US, caused voter turnout among workers to crater, and weakened labor\u2019s ability to check corporate influence in Washington, DC, and state capitals.",
        "The dream of a bipartisan deal on carbon taxes is evergreen in US political circles. Lately, it has taken on a somewhat more specific form. The Climate Leadership Council (led by emeritus Republicans George Shultz and James Baker III) and the libertarian Niskanen Center have both proposed various forms of a deal in which Republicans would agree to a carbon tax in exchange for Democrats agreeing to repeal regulations on carbon emissions and fuel economy (among others). Reporter Amy Harder (who recently moved from the Wall Street Journal to Axios) points out that no Republicans support the deal.",
        "ROCKVILLE, Maryland \u2014 A woman was working on her taxes with a tax preparer Friday morning when a green box popped up on the computer screen: \u201cTaxpayer\u2019s Social Security number is not valid. \u201d This wasn\u2019t a surprise. The woman was an undocumented housekeeper from El Salvador who had come to file her tax returns at Casa de Maryland, which hosts two federally subsidized tax centers that help workers file their taxes for free. So far this year, the group has helped 198 unauthorized immigrants file their taxes.",
        "Girls aired a fantastic series finale. The episode managed to acknowledge a show\u2019s deep roots while excavating them. It asked the show\u2019s characters take their hardest, most unflattering looks at themselves and each other, tearing them apart before throwing them back together for a bittersweet dance party before everything changed forever. But that episode wasn\u2019t the show\u2019s final one. \u201cGoodbye Tour\u201d \u2014 which saw Hannah (creator Lena Dunham) let go of New York City and the nightmares friends she found there \u2014 was Girls\u2019 penultimate chapter."
