        "For fans of serious science fiction, there aren\u2019t too many options on TV these days. Despite this age of peak TV and the glut of original programming that has yielded some extremely popular genre series, including Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead, science fiction has struggled to find a foothold, and most of what exists is essentially contemporary in setting (think Westworld or Person of Interest). For the kind of classic built around spaceships and interplanetary relations, there\u2019s really only one choice: The Expanse. Fortunately, it\u2019s a good choice.",
        "Except when the topic turns to a fire at the Atlanta Braves\u2019 new stadium, Phil Lunney can hardly go a few minutes in his Atlanta suburb without hearing about Democratic House candidate Jon Ossoff. Lunney gets into his car and hears Ossoff being discussed on the radio. Ossoff is the subject of constant and feverish discussion among local liberals. Turn on the television, and every break is blanketed with Ossoff coverage \u2014 normally, one ad sandwiched between two negative ads. \u201cHe\u2019s literally everywhere,\u201d said Lunney, the head of the Fulton County Democrats, in an interview. \u201cYou can\u2019t escape it.",
        "President Trump likes to say that he doesn\u2019t want to announce in advance when he\u2019s going to launch an attack. But on Tuesday, he signed an executive order that did just that. While on a visit to the headquarters of Tools in Kenosha, Wisconsin, the president ordered an interdepartmental review of the visa program, which allows companies to bring \u201cskilled\u201d foreign workers to fill jobs in the US for a few years.",
        "On Tuesday morning, Americans woke up to some confusing news: The United Kingdom is having a general election on June 8 \u2014 even though the next one wasn\u2019t supposed to happen until 2020. \u201dI have concluded the only way to guarantee certainty and security for years ahead is to hold this election,\u201d Prime Minister Theresa May said in a televised statement. \u201cDivision in [Parliament] will risk our ability to make a success of Brexit.\u201d Under British law, all May needs to call a snap election is a vote in the British Parliament, which she appears certain to get.",
        "President Donald Trump wants to build a wall on the southern border of the US. It\u2019s going to be expensive. That\u2019s about specific as it gets with the White House\u2019s proposal to build roughly 2, 000 miles of walls and fences across the southern border. An initial estimate floated by the administration pegged the cost at $12 billion. But a recent report put together by Democrats on the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs estimated the price tag for the wall and patrolling technology at a whopping $70 billion \u2014 more than four times Trump\u2019s initial figure.",
        "Craigslist is where you find used sofas, not lawyers. But I\u2019m desperate, so I send my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Five minutes later, Nick calls to set up an interview. I put on my only suit and drive to the Hollywood office of a tax debt resolution firm. I park in the adjacent lot, hoping they validate. There\u2019s nowhere to sit in Nick\u2019s office, so I stand. Nick is with sleepy eyes and a Southern drawl. He occupies a worn green leather love seat, a newspaper spread across his lap.",
        "It\u2019s official. The Great Barrier Reef cannot be saved. The prognosis comes from the Australian government\u2019s Reef 2050 advisory committee, made up of experts and scientists responsible for managing the reef\u2019s future. In the more optimistic times of 2015, the committee put out a report on how to best preserve the reef. But now two of the committee\u2019s experts have told the Guardian that the plan is no longer feasible \u201cdue to the dramatic impacts of climate change. \u201d Instead, they recommend that the goal be revised to \u201cmaintain the ecological function\u201d of the Great Barrier Reef.",
        "Throughout the new season of Mystery Science Theater 3000, new host Jonah keeps attempting to introduce new bot companions to his classic pals Tom Servo and Crow \u2014 to no avail. Each time, Servo and Crow immediately vanquish the incoming android, destroying any perceived threats to replace them with newer models. That\u2019s a great running joke in keeping with Servo and Crow\u2019s characters, but it\u2019s also a metaphor for the new season as a whole. Overall, season 11 of MST3K is blessedly familiar \u2014 or at least it is until you scratch the surface.",
        "The polls close at 7 pm on Tuesday night in what may prove the most closely watched House special election in years \u2014 the race for Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District. Democrat Jon Ossoff has emerged as the leader in a crowded field of 18 contenders vying to replace former Rep. Tom Price, now President Donald Trump\u2019s health and human services secretary. Ossoff has raised more than $8 million, far more than any of the other candidates, and most polling \u2014 though notoriously unpredictable for special elections \u2014 pegs him at around 43 percent of the vote.",
        "Thursday at 3 pm, President Trump will announce whether or not the United States should stay in the Paris climate deal \u2014 the key international treaty to tackle global warming. Update: President Trump pulls US out of the Paris climate agreement The stakes are high: The Paris accord is a nonbinding treaty that will depend on persuasion and cooperation to succeed.",

        "On Tuesday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to review their policies with respect to hiring foreign workers, and to examine the controversial visa program for skilled foreign workers, popular with many tech companies. The order also directed agencies to minimize the number of waivers the government issues that allow exceptions to \u201cBuy American Laws. \u201d Trump signed the order while on a visit to the headquarters of a tool manufacturer in Kenosha, Wisconsin.",

Sign up to get VoxCare in your inbox here. Republicans hate Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate, which requires Americans who don\u2019t have health insurance to pay a penalty. So do most Americans. But now it\u2019s the Trump administration\u2019s obligation to enforce it. Today, Tax Day, is when that bill comes due.",
        "Someday you\u2019ll likely be able to slip on a pair of special glasses and see realistic digital objects \u2014 from cartoon monsters to your friends\u2019 faces \u2014 superimposed on the real world. But that vision may be years away from coming to fruition, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg doesn\u2019t want to wait. So on Tuesday, he announced that Facebook is taking a shortcut: creating software that gives ordinary smartphones sophisticated capabilities. Zuckerberg envisions users holding their phones in front of their faces to see virtual objects superimposed on the physical world.",
        "On April 9 \u2014 nine days ago \u2014 the Trump administration announced that it was sending an aircraft carrier and four accompanying vessels to Korean waters. The strike group was supposed to be doing exercises near Australia, but the administration was diverting it in anticipation of a possible North Korean missile test. The scary implication: The US was putting its warships in place in preparation for a possible strike on North Korea.",
        "President Trump signed a new executive order Tuesday that\u2019s supposed to make it harder for federal contractors to use cheaper imported products \u2014 especially steel \u2014 when building roads and bridges with public money. The president\u2019s order, dubbed \u201cBuy American, Hire American,\u201d was first reported Monday by the Wall Street Journal. (The \u201chire American\u201d part refers to changes to visas for highly skilled workers.) As part of the order, Trump will require all construction companies working on federally funded projects to use steel.",
        "Blink and you will literally miss everything in the teaser trailer for Kingsman 2: The Golden Circle. The promotional campaign for the upcoming sequel takes the word \u201cteaser\u201d literally in a new trailer released Tuesday: The clip intentionally crams a disorienting blur of action, explosions, and stars like Halle Berry and Channing Tatum (who appears to be in Brokeback Mountain cosplay) \u2014 along with images of butterflies, cheeseburgers, and a vintage theater marquee \u2014 into 15 seconds\u2019 worth of frames.",
        "Last week, President Trump said that he hadn\u2019t realized how difficult it would be to disarm North Korea until he received a short history lesson from Chinese President Xi Jinping. \u201cAfter listening for 10 minutes, I realized it\u2019s not so easy,\u201d Trump confessed to the Wall Street Journal. But it appears Xi\u2019s impromptu North Korea 101 class didn\u2019t go quite far enough. Trump doesn\u2019t seem to know exactly who the leader of North Korea is \u2014 or have any grasp of how long he\u2019s been in power.",
        "Today is one of the biggest days on Facebook\u2019s calendar: the start of F8, Facebook\u2019s annual developer conference. Software developers from around the world have traveled to San Jose, California, to learn about Facebook\u2019s latest technology initiatives and mingle with other programmers. And the biggest event on the agenda is the keynote by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

        "Romanian director Cristian Mungiu is one of international cinema\u2019s truly revered auteurs. He first made waves in 2007 with the release of his brilliant 4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days, a nightmarish odyssey involving a young woman trying to help her friend get an illegal abortion in 1980s Bucharest, which won the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes. Mungiu returned to Cannes in 2012 to premiere the engrossing Beyond the Hills, a film about a pair of estranged former lovers from the same orphanage who meet again at a convent, with devastating consequences.",
        "President Donald Trump\u2019s tax reform effort has many problems. The issue itself is fiendishly complex, affecting a host of different interest groups who are already lobbying furiously. House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s framework for a bill is tremendously unpopular in the Senate. And the president himself has sent mixed signals, lately saying he wants to give health care another shot rather than moving on. This morning the New York Times\u2019 Alan Rappeport points out another serious problem \u2014 President Trump\u2019s refusal to release own his tax returns.",
        "The blame game over the American Health Care Act\u2019s demise is escalating, threatening any prospect for a deal to resurrect the Republican Obamacare replacement bill. The archconservative House Freedom Caucus has taken the brunt of the public shaming, including from President Donald Trump himself. But nobody wants to be culpable for such an embarrassing failure in the first few months of renewed GOP control of the federal government. That\u2019s led to some slightly bewildering statements, like this one from Rep. Dave Brat of Virginia, a Freedom Caucus stalwart. From the Washington Times: Rep.",
        "After decades of declines in the murder rate, 2016 may have been the second bloody year in a row in America. According to a new report by the Brennan Center for Justice, the US murder rate rose by 7. 8 percent in 2016 compared with 2015. It\u2019s the second year in a row in which the murder rate increased. The outlook was even worse in big cities. In the 30 largest US cities, Brennan estimated that the murder rate increased by 14 percent from 2015 to 2016, following an increase of 13. 2 percent in 2015.",
        "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan narrowly won a referendum on Sunday that gives him vast new powers while eviscerating the parliament and judiciary that stand as the last checks and balances against his increasingly autocratic rule. European leaders stayed mostly silent. International monitors condemned the vote as unfair. And then there was President Donald Trump, who called Erdo\u011fan to congratulate him on the win.",
        "The Democratic Party is going all in on Georgia. More than $8 million in outside donations and 7, 000 volunteers have come to the aid of Democrat Jon Ossoff, who is hoping to clear the 50 percent mark during Tuesday\u2019s special election in the Atlanta suburbs. Liberals see a lot riding on the race. A win would deliver Democrats their first major electoral victory over President Donald Trump and a jolt of momentum to their base \u2014 and it would have added resonance given Democrats\u2019 surprisingly strong finish in a Kansas special election two weeks ago.",
        "Activist Debbie Dooley has some choice words for individuals who believe that fossil fuels have no impact on the environment. \u201cIf you think fossil fuel is not damaging the environment,\u201d she says, \u201cpull your car in a garage, start up your engine, and inhale the exhaust fumes for a few minutes and see what happens. \u201d You could be forgiven for suspecting that Dooley might be a Democrat. According to a Gallup poll conducted last year, 85 percent of Democrats believe humans are contributing to increases in global temperature. But she\u2019s not.",
        "On April 1, a report in the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta rocked the global LGBTQ community: At least 100 men who are gay or believed to be gay had been recently rounded up and tortured by authorities in Chechnya, in the Northern Caucuses region of southern Russia. And at least three, according to the report, had been killed. The catalyst seems to have been an attempt to organize an LGBTQ pride march in the region, prompting a crackdown against local gay and bisexual men.",
        "For years now, carbon dioxide emissions in the United States and Europe have been steadily falling \u2014 an encouraging sign of progress in the fight against global warming. But on the flip side, emissions in developing countries like China and India have been growing at a very rapid clip. So one natural question to ask is just how closely these two things are related. That is, are rich countries just \u201coutsourcing\u201d their climate pollution to poorer countries, by shifting their factories overseas? The answer is basically yes.",
        "One Direction breakout star Harry Styles is a solo act now, but he\u2019s not about to dismiss the fan base that made him the international icon he is today. In a new cover story for Rolling Stone, Styles tells writer Cameron Crowe why he\u2019ll never fall all over himself trying to please older potential fans when he\u2019s already got such savvy and devoted ones in the demographic that made One Direction a sensation: teenage girls. \u201cWho\u2019s to say that young girls who like pop music \u2014 short for popular, right?"
