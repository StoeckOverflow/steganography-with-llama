        "Manuel Gonzales\u2019s novel The Regional Office Is Under Attack! \u2014 newly out in paperback \u2014 belongs to a genre I loosely define as \u201cliterary deconstructions of science fiction and tropes. \u201d That\u2019s the genre where the Grossman brothers live, both Lev, with his Magicians novels, and Austin, with his take on what drives the psychology of the mad scientist in Soon I Will Be Invincible. It\u2019s where Jonathan Lethem does his gritty, novels, like A Gambler\u2019s Anatomy or The Fortress of Solitude. Works that fall into this genre are not, exactly, magical realism.",
        "At Karl Marx\u2019s funeral, his longtime friend and collaborator Friedrich Engels proclaimed to the less than dozen people gathered, \u201cHis name will endure through the ages, and so also will his work. \u201d Engels has certainly been vindicated. While Marxism has failed, Marx\u2019s ideas changed the world. Still, the story of Marx, the thinker, is complicated. Marx got plenty of things right. His critique of capitalism is flawed but imperishably useful. He understood that industrialization would upend prevailing social systems and create news ones in their place.",
        "Early on in Netflix\u2019s 13 Reasons Why, two girls confront a boy who\u2019s been watching them. \u201cHave you ever heard of the male gaze?\u201d one of the girls asks. \u201cNo,\u201d the boy says. \u201cWell, we have,\u201d the girl responds. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not totally sure what it means, but you have it. \u201d 13 Reasons Why is, among other things, a show about the concept of the male gaze, the idea that when our culture tells visual stories, we assume the viewer by default to be masculine, heterosexual, and predatory.",
        "Last Thursday, NBC News issued an anonymously sourced report claiming that the Trump administration was poised to carry out a preemptive strike against North Korea if Pyongyang conducted another nuclear test, as many expected would happen in the next few days. Luckily, it seems the report was wrong \u2014 defense and intelligence officials aggressively downplayed the possibility of a preemptive strike, calling the report \u201cwildly wrong,\u201d \u201ccrazy,\u201d and \u201cextremely dangerous,\u201d according to Fox News\u2019s Jennifer Griffin.",
        "A frequent fantasy in American politics \u2014 now brought to reality by the ascension of Donald Trump \u2014 is that a person without real subject matter knowledge could be an effective president by relying on skilled subordinates. Trump made a version of this argument on the campaign trail, arguing that he would \u201chire the best people\u201d for key roles in his administration. And lots of Americans have taken solace in the fact that many of Trump\u2019s key Cabinet appointees do, indeed, appear to be knowledgeable in their issue areas.",
        "Donald Trump appears to be delivering on one core promise, even as many other aspects of his agenda have languished: He has made life for undocumented immigrants much, much scarier. New data obtained by the Washington Post\u2019s Maria Sacchetti show that during the first several weeks of the Trump administration (through March 13) Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested 21, 362 immigrants \u2014 including 5, 441 with no criminal record. That\u2019s a huge increase from the last two years of the Obama administration, when noncriminal immigrants living within the US had little reason to fear deportation.",
        "After weeks of public criticism \u2014 and an advertising boycott involving more than 80 companies \u2014 Fox News has dropped Bill O\u2019Reilly, the longtime TV host who has repeatedly faced claims of sexual harassment, according to a press release Wednesday afternoon from parent company 21st Century Fox. O\u2019Reilly, whose juggernaut show The O\u2019Reilly Factor propelled Fox News to the top of the cable news rankings, is currently on an Italian vacation until April 24.",
        "Juan Manuel Montes Bojorquez is 23 years old. He came to the United States when he was 9. He has a cognitive disability stemming from a childhood brain injury, and a handful of criminal convictions: one for shoplifting, and three for driving without a license. He was granted protection from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program put into place by former President Barack Obama (which President Donald Trump threatened on the campaign trail to eliminate, but has thus far left in place).",
        "A startup called Juicero sells a $400 machine for making juice. Customers buy the machine and then they get a subscription to special Juicero bags of unsqueezed fruit. You put a bag into the machine and push a button, and in a couple of minutes you have a cup of juice. But a pair of Bloomberg reporters discovered something hilarious: Squeezing the bags with your hands works about as well as doing it with the machine. You don\u2019t really need a $400 machine at all. Investors have pumped $118. 5 million into this dubious invention.",
        "In February, President Donald Trump said that the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear agreement with Iran was \u201cone of the worst deals I\u2019ve ever seen. \u201d His comments were a direct echo of candidate Trump\u2019s rhetoric: In one 2016 speech, he said, \u201cMy number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. \u201d While Trump refused to commit to tearing it up on day one, he repeatedly suggested that the deal was a \u201cdisaster\u201d and that his administration would enforce it more harshly or perhaps seek to renegotiate its terms and make it a \u201ctotally different deal.",

        "Cable news is not a reservoir of deep thinking or serious discourse. The incentives on television, a visual medium, are toward partisan hackery and spectacle. Fox News pioneered this approach in the 1990s, and, more recently, CNN has reduced politics to pure theater. MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes is an exception, however. He\u2019s one of the sharpest minds on TV, and his nightly show, All In, is consistently smart and probing.",
        "President Donald Trump\u2019s surprising decision to launch a cruise missile strike on Syria was sharply criticized by Russia as a \u201cflagrant violation of international law. \u201d While it might be tempting to dismiss this claim as mere Putinesque propaganda, on this question at least, Russia is almost certainly correct. In the view of most international lawyers, the US strike on Syria is a violation of the UN Charter. So why doesn\u2019t anybody, except Russia and some international lawyers, seem to care?",
        "In France, all eyes are on a dapper former banker who has never held public office as the country heads into the second round of voting on Sunday in the French presidential elections. years old, with a face that looks a decade younger, Emmanuel Macron has emerged as France\u2019s last, best, and perhaps only chance of staving off candidate Marine Le Pen. That France finds itself in this position \u2014 hoping for a complete novice to win and cringing at the consequences if he should falter \u2014 has rattled the French political establishment, and Europe.",

        "On Monday, Bernie Sanders and recently elected Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez embarked on a \u201dUnity Tour\u201d in several states to rebrand a party now further from power than it\u2019s been in decades. But serious differences between the Democratic Party\u2019s factions remain. On Wednesday, Sanders and Perez appeared with MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes for their first joint interview \u2014 and it didn\u2019t take long for Hayes to pry open the split in the politicians\u2019 worldviews. Chris Hayes pushes Tom Perez to join Bernie in saying \u201dthe ruling class & billionaire class\u201d are to blame for our problems. Perez refused.",
        "As it fires former Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly following sexual harassment allegations, 21st Century Fox wants people to know that O\u2019Reilly is actually great. Here\u2019s the memo from Fox, which company owners the Murdochs sent out to staff to announce their decision: We\u2019d like to address questions about Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s future at Fox News. After a thorough and careful review of allegations against him, the Company and Bill O\u2019Reilly have agreed that Mr. O\u2019Reilly will not return to the Fox News Channel. This decision follows an extensive review done in collaboration with outside counsel.",
        "When Fox News decided to cancel Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show, it had America on its side. According to a recent poll by Morning Consult from late last week, Americans wanted O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show canceled by a margin: 46 percent said Fox should cancel The O\u2019Reilly Factor, while 22 percent said Fox should keep it on the air. (The rest gave no opinion.) That was a big shift from the week before, when 41 percent said O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show should be canceled versus 28 percent who said it should remain on the air.",
        "Here\u2019s a sign that President Trump\u2019s efforts to restrict who is allowed to enter the United States might be working a bit too well: One of the world\u2019s biggest international airlines is cutting back flights to the US. Emirates Airline, which has more international traffic than any other carrier in the world, has announced that it\u2019s reducing the number of flights it offers to five major American destinations after a plunge in booking from the Middle East that followed from Trump\u2019s attempts to restrict travel from the region.",
        "I once got a press release about a \u201dlandmark\u201d study showing cranberry juice could cut the risk of urinary tract infections. This study piqued my interest. All the credible research I\u2019d seen on cranberry juice and UTIs suggested the sweet stuff had little or no effect. So was this new study really a game changer? When I looked at the paper a little more closely, I found out it wasn\u2019t just funded by Ocean Spray, one of the world\u2019s leading makers of cranberry juice; it was also by Ocean Spray staff scientists.",
        "Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the Republican chair of the House Oversight Committee who is leading the House investigation into the ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, is leaving Congress early \u2014 on June 30, he announced Thursday. Chaffetz said in late April that he would not run for reelection in 2018 \u2014 and now says he will leave the seat mid session to spend more time with family. His early departure (Politico reports he may be appearing on Fox News) would open a seat in his Utah district.",
        "Democrat Jon Ossoff narrowly failed to clinch an outright victory Tuesday in the Georgia Sixth District special election. The fact that Ossoff is headed to a runoff, where he could lose to Republican Karen Handel, is a disappointment to Democrats given their expectations in this first marquee race of the Trump era. Still, this represents a dramatic improvement on the party\u2019s typical performance in a district Republicans have held for decades.",
        "On April 22, Earth Day, tens of thousands of people will assemble in Washington, DC, and several dozen satellite cities to march for science. What does that mean, exactly, to march \u201cfor science\u201d? I have some thoughts on that \u2014 on how to make sense of the controversies around the march (as covered by our own Brian Resnick) and the larger question of science\u2019s relationship to, well, Donald Trump. First, though, a side note on the reality of the march.",
        "Since its initially tiny theatrical release in the fall of 2001, Donnie Darko has become one of the cult hits of the early millennium, known for its eerie, plot and for its cadre of young actors who went on to become household names. The film solidified Jake Gyllenhaal\u2019s status as a breakout star, transitioned Jena Malone out of child stardom, and introduced fans to Jake\u2019s sister, Maggie Gyllenhaal, in what was only the second significant role of her film career. (She\u2019d previously had a memorable supporting turn in another cult film, John Waters\u2019s Cecil B.",
        "In 2016, Democrats lost Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District by 24 points. In Tuesday\u2019s special election, Democrat Jon Ossoff came in first place and captured 48 percent of vote in the district \u2014 not the victory he needed to avoid a runoff this summer, but still a huge improvement in the wealthy Atlanta suburb. Top Democratic strategist Brian Fallon thinks Ossoff\u2019s strong showing is a sign of the kind of Republican House seat that the party has the best chance to flip.",
        "North Korea suffered an embarrassing spectacle over the weekend. Kim Jong Un, North Korea\u2019s leader, ordered a missile launch to celebrate the 105th birthday of his grandfather, the country\u2019s founding president. But the missile blew up almost immediately, ending a fairly impressive military parade through the streets of Pyongyang with the wrong kind of bang. Still, the simple fact that North Korea continues to develop and test missiles \u2014 let alone nuclear weapons \u2014 means it will be one of the thorniest and most complex issues confronting President Donald Trump during his time in office.",
        "When we talk about movies and TV, we usually fixate on actors and directors \u2014 but without writers, the whole ship goes down. And once again, Hollywood\u2019s writers are on the verge of a strike, which, if it happens, would be the sixth writers strike in Hollywood\u2019s history. On April 24, the Writers Guild of America, the union that represents entertainment writers across the country, voted by a wide margin to authorize a strike.",
        "When Per Espen Stoknes looked at polls going back to 1989 assessing the level of public concern about climate change in 39 different countries, he found a surprising pattern in the data. \u201cIncredibly enough, it shows that the more certain the science becomes, the less concern we find in richer Western democracies,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can it be that with increasing level of urgency and certainty in the science, people get less concerned?\u201d After further research, Stoknes, the author of What We Think About When We Try Not to Think About Global Warming, found some answers.",
        "President Donald Trump has advertised his idea for a \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d at the border by arguing it will stop the flow of drugs into the US \u2014 a particularly timely goal as the US struggles with its worst drug crisis ever in the opioid epidemic. The wall\u2019s capabilities, however, could face a big nemesis: an ice cream truck.",
        "The woman who ended up persuading a conservative member of Congress that President Donald Trump should release his tax returns didn\u2019t use to consider herself an activist. When Trump was elected, though, Sara Walters, a consultant in Gainesville, Florida, felt drawn to oppose his agenda. Her involvement eventually led to a brief meeting in February with her member of Congress, Rep. Ted Yoho. Walters talked to Yoho for just 15 minutes, but she managed to persuade the Tea Party \u2014 supporting congressman from a heavily Republican district."
