        "On Earth Day, April 22, thousands of people descended on the National Mall in Washington, DC, and took to the streets in cities across the globe \u2014 in the name of science. Inspired by the success of the January 21 Women\u2019s March on Washington, the March for Science celebrated the scientific method and advocate for using evidence in in all levels of government. Though the event\u2019s website didn\u2019t explicitly mention Trump, it was a protest of his administration\u2019s policies, including his proposal to cut billions in funding for scientific research.",
        "What makes a person decide if they want to take action on climate change? According to a Pew survey, Americans say they are most influenced by education, the media, and personal experiences. One factor that barely plays a role: religious beliefs. Just 6 percent of American adults said their religious views were the most influential factor in deciding whether they think there should be stronger laws on the environment. Reverend Brooks Berndt wants to change that \u2014 he wants to bring religion into the debate over climate change and the environment.",
        "Democrat Jon Ossoff came in first place in the special election for Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District on Tuesday night, but failed to clear the 50 percent he needed to win the seat outright. As a result, Ossoff will face finisher, Republican Karen Handel, in June for a runoff to fill the seat vacated by former Rep. Tom Price, now President Trump\u2019s health and human services secretary. Democrats will likely view the race as a victory, giving them steam looking ahead to 2018 midterms.",
        "Obamacare\u2019s biggest challenge right now has nothing to do with the uncertain Republican bid to repeal and replace it. It\u2019s President Trump\u2019s threats to undermine obscure but important payments that help millions of Americans afford their health care. The Affordable Care Act has aided millions in purchasing private health insurance through billions of dollars of federal spending. Much of that is in the form of tax credits, which reduce the premiums that many people pay every month for their coverage.",
        "Before he was dumped abruptly by Fox News, Bill O\u2019Reilly was an onscreen avatar for the older, whiter, Trump voter. The man chosen to replace him at 8 pm, Tucker Carlson, more closely resembles Trump himself \u2014 a scion of privilege who turned against his fellow elites. And perhaps that is why, for a cable network that is still trying to figure out how it fits into the world of a Trump presidency, Carlson is a shrewd choice.",
        "House Republicans are floating a new amendment to their health care bill \u2014 one that would likely cause even more Americans to lose coverage than the last version. Leaders of the staunchly conservative Freedom Caucus and the more moderate Tuesday Group have reportedly hashed out a proposal that would let some states ditch key Obamacare policies, such as the requirement to charge sick people the same for coverage as healthy people. States would also have the choice to opt out of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s essential health benefit requirement.",
        "Eighteen years ago today, on April 20, 1999, 12 students and one teacher at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, were massacred, shot by two angry young men: Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who then took their own lives. others were wounded. The school shooting was an unmitigated tragedy that sparked nationwide arguments over video game violence, goth culture, guns, teenagers\u2019 use of the internet, and more. And it provided a kind of template for the many acts of mass gun violence that would come.",
        "By the time I began as a drug policy reporter in 2010, I was all in on legalizing every drug, from marijuana to heroin and cocaine. It all seemed so obvious to me. Prohibition had failed. Over the past decade, millions of Americans had been arrested and, in many of these cases, locked up for drugs. The government spent tens of billions of dollars a year on policies \u2014 not just on policing and arresting people and potentially ruining their lives, but also on foreign operations in which armed forces raided and destroyed people\u2019s farms, ruining their livings.",
        "Rents are so high in some of the nation\u2019s biggest cities that families earning well over the median national income are considered poor enough to need federal help to afford housing. In San Francisco, a family of four with an income as high as $105, 000 per year would qualify for Section 8 subsidized housing vouchers. In New York, Los Angeles, Boston, and Washington, DC, a family of four making more than $70, 000 could qualify. That\u2019s no guarantee, though, that families will get the help.",
        "Get Out is a message movie. That\u2019s not a bad thing or a good thing, just a description: Jordan Peele\u2019s hit movie uses horror and comedy to make deliberately unsubtle points about the dangers of being black in America and the hypocrisy of white liberals. And critics loved it for having a lesson to teach. From Slate\u2019s Aisha Harris, who praised Peele for \u201dlaying bare the many layers of America\u2019s historic treatment of the black body,\u201d to Vulture\u2019s David Edelstein, who called the film \u201da of Guess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner?",
        "Alex Jones\u2019s show Infowars often feels like a dark comedy. According to the conspiracy theory \u2014 fueled media titan, there\u2019s a \u201cfungal epidemic\u201d causing everything from rampant brain tumors to Crohn\u2019s disease. Sesame Street\u2019s new autistic Muppet was really designed to normalize autism, a disorder caused by vaccines. Bill Gates\u2019s global health philanthropy is a mass eugenics effort. The epidemic was created by the US government. Claims about global warming are based on \u201cfake science\u201d and only \u201cpromoted by politicians to scare the public into accepting a vast expansion of government to supposedly stop \u2018global warming.",

        "Ah, flying cars. For people of \u2026 a certain age, they are redolent with symbolism. In the 1950s and \u201960s, they represented the promise of a future, the inevitable outcome of relentless American ingenuity. (See: the Jetsons.) For the generations that came after, they grew to represent something else \u2014 the failure of that future to manifest. It became a common, plaintive lament: \u201cWhere is my flying car?\u201d Well, guess what? Thanks to advances in battery energy density, materials science, and computer simulation, it looks like the wait may be over.",
        "We\u2019re excited to announce that Evan McMullin, the 2016 independent presidential candidate and of Stand Up Republic, will be our final interview at next week\u2019s Vox Conversations unconference series.

        "Former President Barack Obama called current French presidential frontrunner Emmanuel Macron today, and it was frankly adorable. Macron was so excited about it that he tweeted a video clip of him talking to Obama over a speakerphone, flags of the European Union and France conspicuously draped behind the desk.

Sign up to get VoxCare in your inbox here. Leaders of the moderate and archconservative wings of the House Republican conference think they have a deal that could revive the American Health Care Act (like I said, I\u2019m calling it Vampire Trumpcare, and you should too). The deal would technically keep Obamacare\u2019s core insurance reforms, but also allow states to waive them if they set up a pool.",
        "This morning Tesla announced a voluntary recall of 53, 000 vehicles shipped in 2016. Tesla shipped a total of 76, 000 vehicles in 2016, so this is a large fraction of the company\u2019s sales for the year. According to Tesla, a defective part in the parking brake could prevent the brake from releasing. \u201cWe do not believe this issue could ever lead to a safety concern for customers and we have not seen a single accident or injury relating to it,\u201d Tesla said in an email statement to Vox.",
        "Facebook wants a direct line into your brain.

        "Add this to the list of news coming out of Venezuela as the country is engulfed by economic and political chaos: GM, one of America\u2019s largest companies, was just forced to shut down its operations in the country after the Venezuelan government abruptly seized control of its car factory there. In a statement, GM said the move was an \u201dillegal judicial seizure of its assets\u201d and that it expected to \u201cvigorously take all legal actions, within and outside of Venezuela, to defend its rights.",
        "On Thursday, Time magazine published its list of the 100 most influential people on earth. One of them is President Trump\u2019s and top adviser Jared Kushner \u2014 an obvious choice on Time\u2019s part given that Kushner has been assigned responsibility for handling everything from the opioid crisis to the conflict. Time got Henry Kissinger, President Nixon\u2019s ethically dubious foreign policy consigliere, to write a short blurb about Kushner \u2014 and his praise was comically faint. Here\u2019s the whole \u2014 I\u2019ve omitted nothing: Transitioning the presidency between parties is one of the most complex undertakings in American politics.",
        "It is bizarre watching House Republicans persuade themselves that the problem they face on health care is cutting a deal between the Freedom Caucus and the Tuesday Group rather than crafting legislation that people actually like, and that will actually make some part of the health care system noticeably better. But the GOP\u2019s refusal to take public opinion even mildly into account has put them in a disastrous position. I\u2019m not sure Republicans realize how deep a hole they\u2019re in on this issue. But here\u2019s a way to make it clear.",
        "It\u2019s the day tens of thousands of Americans gather around the country to celebrate a drug that remains illegal in most of the country: marijuana. April 20 (or ) is cherished by pot smokers around the world as a reason to toke up with friends and massive crowds each year. Major rallies occur across the country, particularly in places like Colorado and California, where marijuana is now legal. But as support for marijuana legalization grows, the festivities are becoming more mainstream.",
        "At the heart of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency is a promise to America \u2014 a promise to reinvigorate iconic industries and restore millions of manufacturing jobs, by defeating the foreign companies that have siphoned them away. Trump has thrown far more words than actions at that promise, but, in one case at least, that could be changing \u2014 though probably not to much effect. Trump has made clear that protecting the steel industry \u2014 and steel jobs \u2014 is one of his top priorities.",
        "Stephen Colbert is the only person who has an idea of what it\u2019s like to be Bill O\u2019Reilly on TV every night other than O\u2019Reilly himself. For nine years, he played \u201cStephen Colbert,\u201d a conservative blowhard pundit based almost entirely on O\u2019Reilly\u2019s style of hosting The O\u2019Reilly Factor. And now that Fox has let O\u2019Reilly go . .. well, Colbert wanted to say a few words. \u201cHe\u2019s been a guest on this show, and I take no pleasure in his downfall,\u201d the Late Show host said, to skeptical laughs. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and publicly gloat.",
        "On Saturday, thousands of people will march on Washington in support of science. And they\u2019ll do so for very good reasons: Science, under the Trump administration, is under assault. As Vox\u2019s Brian Resnick noted recently, the Trump administration has proposed cutting around $7 billion from science programs, including stifling research funding for the EPA and the National Institutes of Health. In this interview, I talk to Dave Levitan, author of the new book Not a Scientist: How Politicians Mistake, Misrepresent, and Utterly Mangle Science.",
        "As a medium, TV has rarely been held up as a destination for excellent action sequences and sprawling adventure plots filmed on location across the globe. For a long time, particularly inventive fight scenes and epics were somewhat restricted to the big screen, where budgets are higher and production schedules are more relaxed. But in the past several years, a new vanguard of and series has advanced the threshold of what was once considered possible to achieve on TV.",
        "It\u2019s government shutdown season again. Congress has until midnight on April 28 to pass a spending bill or the federal government will run out of money and close its doors. While a government shutdown remains a possibility, it is looking unlikely. Already Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen ( ) who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, introduced a continuing resolution to provide one week of funding, effectively extending the shutdown deadline to May 5, to buy Congress more time to negotiate a spending bill.",
        "Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s 200th birthday was last year, but 2017 is shaping up to be the year of the Bront\u00eb sisters regardless. They\u2019ve left the bookshelf to show up onstage and onscreen, and everywhere they go they bring with them allegories of fighting the patriarchy. Charlotte, Emily, and Anne Bront\u00eb \u2014 the sisters who lived in witchy isolation on the English moors and the authors of Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, and Agnes Grey, respectively \u2014 are the subjects of Masterpiece Theatre\u2019s biopic To Walk Invisible, which aired on PBS in February (donors of PBS member stations can stream it here).",
        "It\u2019s no secret that oil and gas companies are on the hunt for new places to drill. But the quest for more fossil fuels could heat up in places you might not expect: our national parks. With President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order on energy, federal agencies are now reviewing all rules that inhibit domestic energy production. And that includes regulations around drilling in national parks that, if overturned, could give oil and gas companies easier access to leases on federal lands they\u2019ve long coveted.",
        "Friday afternoon, Donald Trump traveled to the US Treasury Department where he\u2019s expected to sign a new executive order. The order aims at making life easier for American companies that want to avoid corporate income taxes, relax regulation on some large financial institutions, and make it harder for federal regulators to wind down big banks that fail during a financial crisis."
