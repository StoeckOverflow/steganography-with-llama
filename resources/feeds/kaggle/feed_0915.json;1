        "Justice Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court, on Thursday cast his first major decision \u2014 to allow an execution to move forward. Gorsuch joined Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito to clear the way for Arkansas to execute Ledell Lee. They didn\u2019t explain their decision. Lee is one of eight convicted murderers in Arkansas that the state has rushed to kill this month. Although the executions were supposed to begin on Monday, federal and state courts have so far halted the executions up until now.",
        "I\u2019ve been following the news about Bill O\u2019Reilly and his recent firing intently. The story of a serial harasser who leveraged his workplace power over the people around him is familiar to me. So is the one where the culture of the company allows him to weather the storm around the multiple public lawsuits he was forced to settle, only to be fired when the financial pressure becomes too much to bear. Only in my situation, the accused was proud of what he did. That\u2019s because I worked at American Apparel under its founder and CEO, Dov Charney.",
        "Georgia won\u2019t permit newly registered voters to participate in the June 20 runoff election for the state\u2019s Sixth Congressional District \u2014 a restriction that a new lawsuit argues is illegal. The National Voter Registration Act requires that states allow eligible adults to register to vote at least 30 days before an election. In Georgia, voters can register at least 30 days before a primary. However, if people want to vote in the general election, they need to have registered before the primary. For the June 20 special election, in other words, the registration window effectively closed March 20.",
        "Marine Le Pen, the face of the French is trying to bring identity politics to France \u2014 wagering that direct appeals to the country\u2019s women, Jews, and voters will help her win the French presidency despite widespread concerns about her hardline views on immigration, outsiders, and globalization. That strategy seems to have helped her ride a wave of general public dissatisfaction with the status quo into second place with 21. 7 percent of the voting after the first round of voting on April 23.",
        "This one\u2019s for the energy nerds out there. The University of Texas Austin\u2019s Energy Institute has put out an incredibly useful interactive map showing what types of power plants are cheapest to build in every county in the continental United States. (No, really, it\u2019s fascinating.) Playing around with the map, you can see why natural gas and renewables are likely to provide much of America\u2019s new electric capacity going forward. It also shows why, despite Trump\u2019s promises, it will be extremely difficult to build new US coal plants anytime soon.",
        "The internet has had a field day this week making fun of an juicer called the Juicero. It was supposed to provide ingredients and save people the hassle of having to buy, clean, and cut up their own fruits and vegetables. But a Bloomberg investigation revealed that you didn\u2019t actually need the company\u2019s $399 device to squeeze juice out of the company\u2019s $8 bags of fruits and vegetables. Bloomberg interviewed Juicero investors who were dismayed that they\u2019d sunk millions of dollars into an apparently useless gadget.",

        "When French voters go to the polls Sunday to begin picking their next president, the issues on the table are, without exaggeration, the future of Europe and the identity of France itself. Eleven candidates are currently in the running, but just four have a real chance to move on to a election on May 7. The candidate is leader Marine Le Pen, who has run on a campaign of populism and (mostly) subtle xenophobia. Her main competitor is centrist Emmanuel Macron, a rookie politician seeking elected office for the first time.",
        "Thursday afternoon, the young Trump administration scored an undeniably significant win: It got Egypt\u2019s dictator, Abdel Fattah to release an American aid worker, Aya Hijazi, who had been unjustly detained in a Cairo prison for three years. On Friday afternoon, the Trump team succeeded again \u2014 this time, in cheapening their accomplishment with an exceptionally bizarre video. President Donald Trump tweeted out the video in question, which looks like it was made on a computer that still runs on Windows 95 and exists solely to glorify the president (and Ivanka Trump): WELCOME HOME, AYA! #GodBlessTheUSA pic. twitter.",
        "Marine Le Pen is a leading candidate in the French presidential election, the first round of which is taking place this weekend on April 23. It will be followed by a runoff election on May 7. Le Pen is the leader of France\u2019s political party, the National Front (FN). She won the role of party president in 2011, but the party has been a part of her life since birth: Her father, Le Pen, was of the party and the leader for more than 40 years. Under her father\u2019s leadership, the National Front was seen as xenophobic and .",
        "I\u2019ve been thinking frequently this month about Henrietta, my paternal grandmother. I try to imagine what it felt like to be an American Jew in the with news coming in about what happened to one\u2019s counterparts in Europe. Henrietta and all but one of my grandparents were born in the United States. But in 1945, at the age of 36, my father\u2019s mother died anyway: of breast cancer. And one by one, her sisters all died of the same disease. I wonder about that as well. What \u2014 if any \u2014 treatment did they receive?",
        "The Trump administration rejected Exxon Mobil\u2019s request to resume an oil drilling project in Russia that is currently blocked by US sanctions, a tangible reminder that American policy toward Moscow has yet to change as much as some observers in both countries had expected.",

Sign up to get VoxCare in your inbox here. Donald Trump has, in recent weeks, laid out a vision of Republicans in Congress not actually needing to repeal Obamacare. Instead, the law will simply collapse on itself. \u201dThe best thing we can do, politically speaking, is let Obamacare explode,\u201d he said in late March.",
        "If you believe President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Justice, New York City is a hellscape ridden with crime. In a statement on Friday, the Justice Department claimed that \u201cNew York City continues to see gang murder after gang murder, the predictable consequence of the city\u2019s \u2018soft on crime\u2019 stance. \u201d Very grim stuff. Thankfully, reality is not so grim. In fact, crime in New York City is at record lows.",
        "Stop us if you\u2019ve heard this before: President Donald Trump says the White House tax plan will finally be released next week, but he wouldn\u2019t offer any details on what might be in it. From an interview with the Associated Press published Friday: President Donald Trump says businesses and individuals will receive a \u201dmassive tax cut\u201d under a tax reform package he plans to unveil next week. In an interview with The Associated Press, Trump says the plan will result in tax cuts for both individuals and businesses.",
        "Someone needs to save The from itself. A miniseries that aired in 2016 posted strong ratings (though they trended downward) and, as such, a new miniseries will air in the TV season. The core of the show is still strong.",
        "When powerful men are accused of sexual assault, they stand strong together. When their accusers become vocal about being sexually harassed, they\u2019re paid to shut up. Nothing seems clearer in the aftermath of Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s exit from Fox News. Sure, O\u2019Reilly is leaving the network, but Fox News knew of the several sexual harassment allegations against him long before the rest of the world found out. Executives even shielded him by paying large sums of money to buy victims\u2019 silence.",
        "An American imprisoned in Egypt for the past three years has just returned home, thanks in large part to Donald Trump\u2019s warm relationship with Egypt\u2019s brutal dictator President Abdel Fattah . Trump administration officials are hailing the release as an example of the administration\u2019s \u201cdiscreet diplomacy. \u201d Aya Hijazi, a US citizen, and her Egyptian husband Mohamed Hassanein were freed and flown back to the United States this morning. Hijazi and Hassanein were founders of a humanitarian organization in Cairo for homeless children called Belady.",
        "Bill O\u2019Reilly has long been about preserving an earlier time in America. He spent years standing on the front lines of the war on Christmas, railing against political correctness, and promoting bullish masculinity. And yet, that throwback masculinity finally did him in \u2014 and the longtime host has been ousted from his primetime slot on Fox News. Technically, it wasn\u2019t the years of sexual harassment allegations of Fox News employees and contributors that ended his tenure, though of course, this was a factor. Only weeks ago, the New York Times\u2019s Emily Steel and Michael S.",
        "When you get surgery or have a mole removed, and there\u2019s leftover tissue or blood, there\u2019s a chance that it might not be discarded. It might live on in a lab somewhere, available to researchers, unbeknownst to you. Your doctors didn\u2019t ask you if you wanted to donate your cells. They didn\u2019t have to. As long as your specimens are \u201c \u201d \u2014 meaning your name and other personal information are no longer attached to them anymore \u2014 they\u2019re fair game.",
        "Bill Nye comes out swinging in the first season of Bill Nye Saves the World, his new Netflix series. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be talking about important, perhaps even controversial issues,\u201d he promises. He then dives into a season of controversies, confronting misconceptions about climate change, conspiracies, artificial intelligence, and more. The new series\u2019 structure and tone is heavily influenced by Nye\u2019s connection to the modern skeptics movement, which can be a powerful tool for advancing science \u2014 and at some points in the six episodes of Bill Nye Saves the World that I watched for review, it is.",
        "Three days before the first round of French presidential elections, a terrorist struck Paris. Late on Thursday, a French national named Karim Cheurfi exited his car on the and opened fire on a police van using an automatic weapon \u2014 killing one officer, Xavier Jugel\u00e9. Afterward, officers engaged Cheurfi in a shootout, in which two officers were wounded and Cheurfi was killed. Cheurfi was a disturbed man. In 2005, he was convicted on three counts of attempted murder; France 24 reports that two of the targets were police officers.",
        "The ability of federal judges to strike down actions taken by Congress or the executive branch if they\u2019re deemed unconstitutional is a hallmark of the American system of government. It\u2019s an important part of the system of checks and balances, ensuring that the president and legislators don\u2019t acquire too much power. But to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the nation\u2019s top law enforcement officer, it\u2019s \u201camazing\u201d \u2014 and he means that in a bad way.",
        "It\u2019s been one year since Prince\u2019s death. For many of us, his songs will always represent inescapable sadness, bright sparks of joy, metallic moments of excitement, and all the emotions in between. But what\u2019s also important to remember is that Prince didn\u2019t just create music; He fought for it. In his book, I Would Die 4 U: Why Prince Became an Icon, cultural critic Tour\u00e9 detailed Prince\u2019s groundbreaking life and career. And what struck him as pertinent was Prince\u2019s refusal to be pigeonholed into a genre or have his race determine his stardom.",
        "I was asked recently to name a book that changed my life. The book I chose was Cal Newport\u2019s \u201cDeep Work,\u201d and for the most literal of reasons: It\u2019s changed how I lived my life. Particularly, it\u2019s led me to stop scheduling morning meetings, and to preserve that time for more sustained, creative work.",
        "On January 20, as hundreds of thousands of people flocked to Washington, DC, to attend President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, many artistic institutions across the country shut their doors for the day in an act of protest against the new commander in chief. Yet most major American museums did not join the artists\u2019 strike. Instead, many opted for a subtler form of dissent, waiving their entrance fees or developing programs to specifically address the political moment, like the Whitney\u2019s Speak Out event featuring artists and writers or the Brooklyn Museum\u2019s reading of Langston Hughes\u2019s \u201cLet America Be America Again.",
        "The Library of Congress just released a book on the history of the card catalog, and while I can physically feel you clicking away from this article even as I type, I am here to tell you that The Card Catalog is actually weirdly fascinating. The Card Catalog makes a persuasive case that cataloging knowledge is fundamental to the acquisition and spread of knowledge, and that a working library catalog is, in some ways, a basic necessity of civilization.",
        "President Trump believes the road to disarming North Korea runs through China, its biggest and most powerful ally. The problem is that Beijing doesn\u2019t seem willing to do much of anything to rein Pyongyang in. Trump is right that China is indispensable to North Korea\u2019s economy and serves as its biggest shield against international efforts to end its nuclear program. Unless Trump wants to pursue a potentially catastrophic military strike on North Korea, Beijing features front and center in any political answer to what is rapidly emerging as the most dangerous foreign policy challenge of Trump\u2019s young presidency.",
        "The federal government spends a large amount of money to support the living standards of elderly people \u2014 primarily through Social Security and Medicare but with significant helping hands from Medicaid and disability insurance. That amount is growing as a share of the economy because productivity growth is slowing, and because birthrates continue to fall (in line with a trend) but mostly because Americans are living longer. To many people in Washington, that rising life expectancy is itself a full rationale for cuts to the program.",
        "This year\u2019s Earth Day, April 22, will be dominated by March for Science rallies taking place in Washington, DC, and dozens of other cities around the world. But I also like to mark Earth Day by looking at some of the best new discoveries we\u2019ve made about this breathing, seething, planet of ours \u2014 the only place in the universe where life is known to exist. After all, a lot has changed since the very first Earth Day in 1970. Back then, America\u2019s most urgent environmental problems were smog and water pollution."
