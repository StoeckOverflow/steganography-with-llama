        "Labs across our country are a source of American optimism \u2014 advancing knowledge, technologies, and cures. And yet, as citizens in 500 cities worldwide prepare to march this weekend in support of science, many American scientific practitioners are afraid. They worry that American science as we know it would be hobbled if President Trump\u2019s proposed 18 percent cut to the National Institutes of Health, America\u2019s premier medical research funder, becomes reality. We hope Congress will hear history\u2019s call and American leadership in advancing humanity\u2019s scientific knowledge.",
        "Vivek Murthy, America\u2019s \u201ctop doctor\u201d and an Obama appointee, was dismissed and replaced by the Trump administration on Friday. In a statement, the administration said it asked Murthy to resign from his post as surgeon general after he helped with \u201ca smooth transition. \u201d Thank you America for the privilege of a lifetime. I have been humbled and honored to serve as your #SurgeonGeneral. https: . \u2014 Vivek Murthy (@vivek_murthy) April 22, 2017 \u201dDr.",
        "Thousands of scientists and science enthusiasts braved cold, rainy weather on Saturday to march in Washington, DC, in the name of disciplines they love, the research and discoveries they value, and the policies they oppose. And they came bearing signs \u2014 some of the cleverest, most creative, hilarious ones we\u2019ve seen in an already year. Many in the crowd said they never imagined they\u2019d be out at a rally for science support. \u201cIt never occurred to me that a politician wouldn\u2019t support science,\u201d Amy Blackmer, a marcher from Richmond, Virginia, said.",
        "That screeching sound you heard last week was the sound of President Donald Trump making a on the environment, pulling the United States out of the Paris climate accord. What a difference a year and an election have made. A year ago, the US was making notable progress on some of our toughest environmental problems. Grassroots mobilizations and other forms of pressure helped nudge America\u2019s political leadership to halt pipelines and craft new policies on climate change, fracking, and toxics.",
        "The airy montage of 1950s history and medical science that opens HBO\u2019s The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks temporarily grinds to a halt over a seemingly inconsequential detail \u2014 its title character\u2019s name. Biologist George Gey (Reed Birney) has cultivated \u201cHeLa\u201d \u2014 the world\u2019s first \u201ceternal\u201d line of cancer cells, which can live indefinitely outside the body and thus be used for medical testing. Now, he needs to provide the press with the name of the woman these miraculous cells came from. A moment before he discloses, Gey hesitates, and then he lies.",
        "Every weekend, we pick a movie you can stream that dovetails with current events. Old, new, blockbuster, arthouse: They\u2019re all fair game. What you can count on is a weekend watch that sheds new light on the week that was. The movie of the week for April 22 through 28 is Network, which is available to digitally rent on Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, YouTube, and Vudu. In a remarkable confluence of events, this week has gone haywire for not just one, but two bombastic men who use versions of the news to create something more like entertainment.",
        "Welcome to Vox\u2019s weekly book link roundup, a curated selection of the week\u2019s best writing on books and related subjects. Here is the best the internet has to offer for the week of April 16, 2017. At Jezebel, Anya spent an hour in Emily Dickinson\u2019s bedroom: It\u2019s from her bedroom that Dickinson composed everything. \u201cDickinson\u2019s genius always kept a fixed address,\u201d Dan Chiasson wrote in a December 2016 issue of the New Yorker. \u201cShe was a scholar of passing time, and the big house on Main Street was the best place to study it.",
        "It comes down to the populist versus the globalist. candidate Marine Le Pen and candidate Emmanuel Macron have come out on top in the first round of the French presidential elections and will be moving ahead to the final round on May 7. According to the French polling firm Ipsos, exit polls show Macron with 23. 7 percent followed by Le Pen with 21. 7 percent of the vote. candidate M\u00e9lenchon and conservative candidate Fran\u00e7ois Fillon tied for third place with about 19. 5 percent each. France, Ipsos exit poll:Macron ( *): 23. 7%Le Pen ( ): 21.",
        "This week, Martha Nussbaum \u2014 philosopher, author, and professor of law and ethics at the University of Chicago \u2014 answers our questions. What\u2019s the first piece of media you consume every day? The Chicago Tribune and the New York Times, both papers, delivered to my door each day. Name a writer or publication you disagree with but still read. This strikes me as the most hilarious question, given that I\u2019m a philosopher. Philosophy is all about respectful disagreement, and learning from disagreement. No decent philosopher simply parrots some other philosopher, so there must be disagreements somewhere in every case.",
        "Halfway through the first episode of Girlboss, Sophia Marlowe (Britt Robertson) storms out of her boring retail job after tearing apart her meek boss for the thousandth time and finally getting fired for it. She calls her best friend to complain, then briefly stops in her tracks to wonder, \u201cWhy am I such an asshole?\u201d It\u2019s a solid question \u2014 and one the show would\u2019ve been better off answering sooner rather than later so it could get to her actual story.",
        "Three months after the largest demonstration in US history, Saturday\u2019s March for Science again brought droves of people into the streets to celebrate their values and protest the Trump administration and its policies. And like the Women\u2019s March, the demonstrations happened not just in front of the symbols of political power in Washington, DC, but in cities and towns across the country and around the world. In all, organizers say people marched for science on Earth Day in more than 600 cities and towns across six continents.",
        "The Leftovers, HBO\u2019s critically acclaimed drama, is currently airing its third and final season. Below, Vox Culture writers Todd VanDerWerff and Caroline Framke discuss \u201cDon\u2019t Be Ridiculous,\u201d the season\u2019s second episode, in full \u2014 so beware, there are spoilers here, and lots of \u2019em. Todd: In some ways, Nora Durst\u2019s inability to register with touchscreens is the sort of metaphor The Leftovers sometimes in. Nora, reintroduced to the idea that she might be able to find out what happened to her husband and children in the Departure, starts to feel like she too is slipping off the map.",
        "A former banker with zero political experience just made a whole lot of European leaders really happy. Emmanuel Macron, a young, centrist, pro \u2014 European Union candidate, just came out on top in the first round of voting in the French presidential elections, winning 23. 7 percent of the vote, according to exit polls. He was followed closely by populist Marine Le Pen, who pulled in 21. 7 percent. The two of them will now face off in a runoff election on May 7, and polls show Macron with a solid chance of winning.",
        "Every Sunday, we pick a new episode of the week. It could be good. It could be bad. It will always be interesting. You can read the archives here. The episode of the week for April 16 through 22 is \u201cWe Have Brought You Little Cakes,\u201d the season two finale of Syfy\u2019s The Magicians. In nearly every episode of The Magicians\u2019 second season, I found myself thinking the show\u2019s writers would fuck everything up.",
        "Between windsurfing with Richard Branson and attending Broadway shows with his daughter, Barack Obama has been trying to decide what he wants to get done in his post \u2014 White House years. \u201cI\u2019m spending a lot of time thinking about: \u2018What is the most important thing I can do for my next job? \u2019\u201d Obama said on Monday, in his first public remarks since leaving the presidency on January 20. Obama ticked through a whole host of problems he might make his first priority before identifying what he said will be his No.",
        "The entire US Senate will head to the White House to attend a briefing on North Korea from four top Trump administration officials Wednesday, press secretary Sean Spicer announced Monday. But though it\u2019s unusual for all 100 senators to head to the White House grounds at once, Spicer also stressed that the briefing was not initiated by the White House but by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s office \u2014 a clarification perhaps made to tamp down any speculation that the administration is considering imminent military action in North Korea.",
        "As soon as polls in France closed Sunday for the first round of voting in the presidential election, a very uniquely French thing happened: Virtually all of the defeated presidential candidates and other political leaders promptly coalesced around centrist Emmanuel Macron, who faces off against populist Marine Le Pen on May 7. The endorsements came quickly, and they were notably enthusiastic.",
        "The media often conflates rurality and whiteness in this country. But this is a false \u2014 and misleading \u2014 narrative. Roughly of rural residents in this country are people of color, and their interests and political views are as diverse as they are. When coverage of rural areas dismisses or otherwise ignores this fact, actual political consequences follow: The specific concerns of certain communities simply fall out of view. Mara Casey Tieken, a professor of education at Bates College, studies the impact of race in rural communities.",
        "It does not take more than a few pages for journalists Jon Allen and Amie Parnes to arrive at what amounts to their thesis in Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton\u2019s Doomed 2016 Campaign, a new book built off years of reporting on the trail. \u201c[Clinton\u2019s] campaign was an unholy mess, fraught with tangled lines of authority, petty jealousies, distorted priorities, and no sense of greater purpose. No one was in charge, and no one had figured out how to make the campaign about something bigger than Hillary,\u201d Allen and Parnes write in the book\u2019s introduction.",
        "President Donald Trump\u2019s interview with Associated Press\u2019s Julie Pace was a doozy. In a freewheeling conversation intended to cover Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office, the president made wild assertions about his leadership, pushed false premises about his popularity and success, and made it explicitly clear that there are times he doesn\u2019t know what he is talking about. Here are some of the most bizarre moments from the interview: Trump didn\u2019t know much about NATO \u2014 so he said it\u2019s \u201cobsolete\u201d There were moments Trump stopped pretending.",
        "The Obama White House\u2019s prisoner swap with Iran in 2016 was a much bigger gift to Iran than the administration ever let on. That\u2019s the takeaway from an investigative report from Politico published Monday, which details how the Obama administration deliberately obscured and downplayed the national security threat posed by the seven prisoners and 14 fugitives freed as part of a deal to bring back five American prisoners held captive in Iran.",
        "A few months ago, around 11 at night, my phone lit up with a Twitter notification. I had a direct message from Zardulu, the wizard and performance artist who has claimed to be the mastermind behind the viral Pizza Rat video that took the internet by storm in September 2015. \u201chello,\u201d she said. Three questions immediately occurred to me: Was Zardulu DMing \u201chello\u201d to all of her Twitter followers for unexplained reasons known only to herself? Zardulu is known to give interviews now and then \u2014 she\u2019d done one with my colleague Aja Romano last year.",

        "We\u2019re excited to announce that this week, in an exclusive partnership with TED, Vox\u2019s video team will stream live backstage at the organization\u2019s iconic flagship conference in Vancouver. Over the course of four days, TED and Vox will broadcast live interviews with the brilliant speakers and participants, led by Vox\u2019s Dara Lind, Liz Plank, Phil Edwards, and me. We\u2019ll talk to surgeon and journalist Atul Gawande about health care; David Miliband, CEO of the International Rescue Committee, about the international refugee crisis; and many more surprises. Each conversation will broadcast live on both Vox and TED\u2019s Facebook pages.",
        "Flying cars have long been a staple of science fiction, but until recently the technology to build small, versatile flying vehicles hasn\u2019t really existed. But that may be about to change. John Markoff of the New York Times has given the world its first look at a flying vehicle created by Kitty Hawk, a startup funded by Google billionaire Larry Page. It looks a bit like a version of the quadcopter drones a lot of people got under their Christmas trees in recent years.",

        "As the Trump administration turns, allegedly, to the development of a tax reform proposal, it\u2019s notable that his administration\u2019s Treasury Department does not yet have any confirmed political appointees for the jobs that would be tasked with reforming the tax code. There is supposed to be an Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy, who is supposed to be assisted by Deputy Assistant Secretaries for Tax Policy, Tax Analysis, and International Tax Affairs. The department, obviously, continues to be staffed by a large number of skilled career civil servants.",
        "Before Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles was a living hit goddess, she beat the snot out of Ali Larter. In the distant past of 2009, when both Knowles and her Idris Elba were on a somewhat lower tier of fame, it made sense for them to take the leading roles in the erotic drama Obsessed. They played a married couple terrorized by Larter\u2019s unstable interloper, a secretary who spontaneously develops an insatiable desire for Elba\u2019s power executive.",
        "As some Southern states celebrate the Confederate States of America, New Orleans is tearing down symbols of its racist past. According to CNN, New Orleans\u2019s latest move happened in the dark of night, as the city tore down the first of four memorials that honor the Confederate States: the Battle of Liberty Place monument, which was erected in 1891 to celebrate a deadly insurgency in 1874 \u2014 led by the white supremacist Crescent City White League \u2014 against an integrated police force and state militia. New Orleans also plans to dismantle a statue commemorating Confederate General Robert E.",
        "When I stepped out of the elevator at the Wing (\u201ca home base and social club for women in New York\u201d) I could\u2019ve been walking into any trendy New York City party packed with women in ankle boots and fitted overalls, held in a venue where the walls are lined with bookshelves painstakingly organized by color. But I wasn\u2019t there to drink spritzers or eat charcoal emulsions in cucumber cups (though, okay, I did that, too)."
