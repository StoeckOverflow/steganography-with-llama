        "Like a sad father, Bill Nye wasn\u2019t mad that he was forced to debate climate change on CNN; he was disappointed that CNN had presumably pitted him against a climate change denier to create drama instead of spreading factual information. \u201cI will say, much as I love the CNN, you\u2019re doing a disservice by having one climate change skeptic and not 97 or 98 scientists or engineers concerned about climate change,\u201d he said during a segment on the April 22 March for Science that aired Saturday night.",
        "In his first speech since leaving the presidency, Barack Obama will speak on Monday at the University of Chicago about the importance of \u201ccivic engagement. \u201d The event, scheduled to begin at noon Eastern time, will be held at the University of Chicago\u2019s Logan Center. You can watch a live stream of the event on . Several high school, college, and university graduate students from the Chicago area will join him onstage, according to the Chicago Maroon, the university\u2019s student newspaper.",
        "Barack Obama is back. But don\u2019t expect him to start attacking his successor. On Monday, the former president will end his exile from public life \u2014 and series of vacations \u2014 with a speech at the University of Chicago and a conversation with a small group of the college\u2019s students. \u201dThis event is part of President Obama\u2019s goal to encourage and support the next generation of leaders driven by strengthening communities around the country and the world,\u201d Obama\u2019s office said in a statement. He\u2019ll follow that up next week with a speech at the John F.",
        "If you visit Philadelphia, in addition to seeing the Liberty Bell, you\u2019ll spot one of the thousands of murals in the city. That leads to a natural question: Why does Philly have so many murals? The city\u2019s unique public art program is the answer, as the above video shows. Mural Arts Philadelphia is a unique organization that mobilizes public and private funds to drive a very tenacious group of artists and administrators to cover the city in murals.",
        "Nearly a year ago, scientists noticed that the water level of the Slims River in British Columbia was extremely low. So they hopped into a helicopter and flew upstream to investigate. What they found startled them: A second, more powerful river, the Kaskawulsh, had stolen the Slims River\u2019s water for itself. Three days later, the Slims was gone entirely. For centuries, meltwater from the Kaskawulsh Glacier had fed both the Slims and Kaskawulsh rivers. But in the past 100 years, the glacier has retreated as a result of climate change.",
        "The first round of France\u2019s presidential election, held on Sunday, narrowed the field of 11 candidates to the two top vote getters: the charismatic young centrist Emmanuel Macron, who won 23. 9 percent of the vote, and populist Marine Le Pen, who won 21. 4 percent. These two will now face off in a May 7 second round to determine who, ultimately, gets to lead France. This was the result most pollsters were predicting before the vote.",
        "President Donald Trump famously promised Americans so much winning that they\u2019d be sick of it. He appears obsessed with this promise, to the point of actively undermining it. He is so focused on winning \u2014 or claiming to win \u2014 every little battle, that he has neglected the patient work required to win big wars in Congress. This strategy should unnerve conservatives; almost any other Republican president drawn from last year\u2019s primary field would be scoring more wins for their cause right now than Trump has. It should especially worry Trump\u2019s advisers.",
        "A wave of recent columns argue that what Trump superfans \u2014 or at least some hazily imagined, Northern version of them \u2014 really want is respect. By all appearances, though, the opposite is the case. Those voters want what most voters want from politicians: to be disrespected, via shameless pandering and the occasional blatant lie.",
        "The election of Donald Trump has lit a fire under people who donate to nonprofit organizations \u2014 or, at least, to some nonprofit groups. In the three months after Election Day, the ACLU collected more than $79 million online \u2014 more than 60 percent of what the organization spent in all of 2016. Planned Parenthood has been raking in donations as well, though it won\u2019t say how much, possibly because the figure is so large that disclosing it would discourage more giving. The largesse has been unequally distributed, however. organizations remain vulnerable.",
        "If you miss out on the last few episodes of Saturday Night Live this summer, blame America\u2019s struggle to bring its health care costs under control. The Writers Guild of America, the union that represents television and film writers, could go on strike as early as May 2 \u2014 and a big reason why is the cost of health care. The union and the Hollywood studios it contracts with are at an impasse. The workers will likely vote Monday to authorize a strike.",
        "To understand what France\u2019s election means, and what it tells us about the rise of movements around Europe, you need to understand two fundamental truths about the results. The first is that it\u2019s a historic victory for the Marine Le Pen and her National Front party. Le Pen was one of two candidates who qualified for the second round, soundly beating the of both of France\u2019s traditional establishment parties \u2014 the Republicans and Socialists. The FN has clearly entered the mainstream of French politics.",
        "When I was 26 years old and living in South Africa, I was offered a job that required me to live in the United States. It should have been good news. I had hoped for this job offer for months. But there was a problem: I did not want to leave my partner, whom I had met in South Africa eight months before. For weeks, I worried about my decision. I wanted to tell my new potential boss about my romantic relationship and ask if I could work from South Africa to stay with him.",
        "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 might be the most anticipated film of the year, give or take a Star Wars. The sequel arrives in theaters on May 5, three years after Guardians of the Galaxy \u2014 a lighthearted space opera with a great ensemble full of strange characters \u2014 became one of Marvel Studios\u2019 biggest surprise successes. Sure, the story was a little disjointed, and the film\u2019s bad guys weren\u2019t nearly compelling enough (a frequent Marvel problem). But the film\u2019s sardonic sense of humor, courtesy of director and James Gunn, was more than enough to carry the day.",
        "President Trump is planning to include a massive cut in the top tax rate on \u201c \u201d companies, from its current level of 39. 6 percent to a mere 15 percent, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Michael Bender and Richard Rubin report. This will be sold as a boost for small businesses, and it is, but it is mostly a huge giveaway to the rich \u2014 including the president himself.",
        "Before President Trump arrived in office, he promised to strip all federal funding from \u201csanctuary cities\u201d \u2014 cities that didn\u2019t do enough, in his estimation, to help the federal government enforce immigration law \u2014 in his first 100 days in office. The Trump administration is on the cusp of blowing that deadline. And now a federal court ruling threatens to thwart it from carrying out that defunding threat at all. A ruling issued Tuesday by Judge William H.",
        "For 35 years, the US and Canada have been locked in an endless fight about imported lumber \u2014 a cycle of tariffs and truces that has repeated itself under every president since Ronald Reagan. President Donald Trump, though, has found a way to use this otherwise mundane issue for political gain. On Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced that the United States will slap a 20 percent tariff on most Canadian softwood lumber imports, the kind of wood commonly used to build homes.",
        "Congress is barreling toward a government shutdown deadline. The House and Senate have until midnight on April 28 to pass a spending bill or the federal government will run out of money and close its doors. Despite controlling every lever of government, Republicans are somehow faced with the possibility that they can\u2019t get the votes together to keep the government open. Added to that, the shutdown deadline happens to coincide with President Donald Trump\u2019s mark, when journalists and historians assess what the White House has accomplished thus far. Needless to say, a shutdown would be a very bad look.",
        "Here is the most frightening thing you\u2019ll read all day: Growing numbers of US intelligence officials believe North Korea can produce a new nuclear bomb every six or seven weeks. That\u2019s one of the most jarring takeaways in an exhaustive New York Times story about North Korea\u2019s rapidly expanding nuclear program \u2014 and the decades of US efforts that have tried, and failed, to slow it. The Trump administration plans to detail its own approach Wednesday when it brings the entire US Senate to the White House for a highly unusual briefing on the North Korean threat.",
        "The Handmaid\u2019s Tale \u2014 both the 1985 book by Margaret Atwood and Hulu\u2019s forthcoming adaptation \u2014 is a dystopian story about women who are reduced to the functionality of their wombs, about a Puritan theocratic society that views women as sexual objects and punishes them for it.",
        "Former President Barack Obama\u2019s decision to accept a $400, 000 fee to speak at a health care conference organized by the bond firm Cantor Fitzgerald is easily understood. That\u2019s so much cash, for so little work, that it would be extraordinarily difficult for anyone to turn it down. And the precedent established by former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, to say nothing of former Federal Reserve Chairs Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan and a slew of other former officials, is that there is nothing wrong with taking the money.",
        "When liberals talk about their health care utopia, they have scores of examples to choose from. Some name France\u2019s system (No. 1 on the World Health Organization\u2019s rankings, in case you haven\u2019t heard). Others point to Canada\u2019s simplicity. The Scandinavian countries all do health care well, and there\u2019s much to recommend Germany\u2019s hybrid approach. Conservatives really only have one example of a free market health care paradise to point to: Singapore. But oh, what an example it is! In a New York Times column called \u201cMake America Singapore,\u201d Ross Douthat called it \u201cthe marvel of the wealthy world.",
        "As President Trump prepares to unveil his \u201cmassive\u201d tax cuts on Wednesday, an outline of his plan is starting to emerge. According to reports from the Wall Street Journal, it\u2019s basically the same as what he\u2019s been touting all along: trillions of dollars in tax cuts for corporations and businesses (\u201c \u201d) plus a small tax break for child care expenses.",

        "We hear a lot about the policy debate over \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d and that information gets filtered through our political preferences. Our perception is that the leaders who run these municipalities are either flagrantly flouting federal law or offering refuge for one of the nation\u2019s most marginalized groups. But one thing that doesn\u2019t come up all that much in these debates is an explanation of what exactly these sanctuary cities do. That\u2019s what you\u2019ll find in the video above.",
        "President Donald Trump delivered the type of strong, somber speech about the Holocaust Tuesday morning that US presidents from both parties have made for decades. He highlighted the uniquely Jewish nature of the tragedy, derided Holocaust denial as well as and bluntly labeled the mass slaughter of European Jewry \u201chistory\u2019s darkest hour. \u201d \u201cThose who deny the Holocaust are accomplice to this horrible evil,\u201d he said in remarks in the rotunda of the US Capitol commemorating the Days of Remembrance surrounding Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Memorial Day. \u201cWe will never, ever be silent in the face of evil again.",
        "Justice Sonia Sotomayor says the Supreme Court is letting police off the hook too easily. In a surprising dissent backed only by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sotomayor wrote in detail about one of the biases in the legal system that may let cops get away with excessive use of force \u2014 by slanting the system in favor of the police officer. \u201cOur failure to correct the error made by the courts below leaves in place a judgment that accepts the word of one party over the word of another,\u201d Sotomayor wrote.",
        "Donald Trump touts conspiracy theories more than most presidents in recent history, or perhaps any president ever. Trump has claimed that President Obama wiretapped his phone during the presidential campaign (a charge the FBI denied) and that several million people voted illegally in the election (also: no evidence). In the past, he\u2019s said that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese (it\u2019s not). But he\u2019s certainly not alone in jumping to conspiracies to explain world events. Often conspiracy theories can be powerful and damaging.",
        "Ivanka Trump is having trouble convincing the world that her father cares about women\u2019s issues. Trump spoke at a panel on women\u2019s entrepreneurship at the W20 conference \u2014 a summit of G20 countries aimed at promoting women\u2019s workforce participation and equality \u2014 in Berlin, Germany, on Tuesday. During the panel, her comments in defense of her father\u2019s treatment of women and his support for policies like paid family leave was reportedly met with boos and hissing from the crowd \u2014 and skepticism from the panel moderator herself.",
        "The Writers Guild of America has voted to authorize a strike, to the tune of 96 percent of the vote with the membership casting more than 6, 300 votes. (That\u2019s around 67. 5 percent of guild members who were eligible to vote, which the WGA says is turnout.) That\u2019s a big deal."
