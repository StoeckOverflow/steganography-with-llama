        "One of the touted benefits of Obamacare, particularly in the midst of the opioid epidemic, is it can link drug users to insurance needed to pay for potentially addiction treatment. But a new study suggests that Obamacare is ultimately limited in just how far it can go. The study, conducted by researchers Johanna Catherine Maclean and Brendan Saloner and published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, tells a mixed story about Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion.",
        "On the campaign trail, Donald Trump often shut out members of the mainstream media, barring certain reporters and entire outlets from attending his rallies. During the transition, he would dodge the press pool, once forcing them to stake out his dinner in Manhattan from behind a dumpster. But a funny thing happened when Trump reached the White House: He quietly cozied up to reporters. Though Trump continues to beat up on the \u201cvery dishonest\u201d media, relationships between White House officials and the women and men who cover them are surprisingly intimate.",
        "We know which pair of France\u2019s 11 presidential candidates will face off in next month\u2019s decisive second round of voting. Now we\u2019re learning a lot more about why the last two standing are centrist Emmanuel Macron and leader Marine Le Pen, who will face each other in a runoff on May 7. This result, while largely in line with polling expectations, is still a huge event in the arc of French politics.",

In the past couple of years, Waymo has had dozens of cars on the road racking up more than 2 million miles of driving experience.

        "Most Americans think President Donald Trump should keep the Affordable Care Act on the books and want to see him improve the law, a new Washington News Poll finds. More than a dozen recent polls have shown the Affordable Care Act becoming increasingly popular as Republicans work to dismantle it. Obamacare is now more popular than the Democratic Party, Republican Party, House Speaker Paul Ryan, and President Trump himself.

The American Shakespeare Center in Staunton, Virginia, has long been a source for contemporary interpretations of Shakespeare\u2019s plays.

        "A vinyl record is breakable: not terribly, but obviously. Pull it from between the sheaths of its cover, and the rings shine. Drop it, and it won\u2019t shatter \u2014 but bend it, and it\u2019ll snap. To keep a vinyl record in good condition, to make sure it will last to be a thing that can survive you, you have to be careful with it. You have to appreciate its very existence. For years, critics and market researchers have treated the vinyl medium\u2019s resurgence in the digital age with the same kind of tentative caution.",
        "On Wednesday, President Trump will unveil a new set of principles for what he calls \u201cmassive\u201d tax cuts for businesses and individuals \u2014 a plan bigger \u201cthan any tax cut ever. \u201d Those massive cuts will come with a massive problem for Trump\u2019s economic team: how to pay for them. The White House doesn\u2019t appear to have settled on a means of making up the trillions of dollars in lost federal revenue that economists predict will accompany cuts.",
        "The role of governor of a progressive West Coast state has taken on a somewhat different resonance since Jay Inslee was first elected in 2012. Comfortably reelected in 2016, he now finds himself part of a symbolic rebellion against the Trump Empire. (Sorry, just watched the Star Wars trailer.) With carbon policy moribund at the federal level, more attention than ever is focused on the west coast states that are making climate progress. California recently adopted some of the world\u2019s most ambitious carbon targets. Oregon recently banned coal. British Columbia has a carbon tax in place.",
        "If every Donald Trump voter again cast their ballot for Donald Trump in 2020, he could still fall short of victory \u2014 possibly devastatingly so. Approximately 46 percent of Americans voted for Trump in 2016. That\u2019s fewer than voted for Mitt Romney four years earlier and only slightly more than the 45. 5 percent who voted for John McCain during his landslide defeat in 2008. That Trump became president where Romney and McCain failed is a fascinating story of demographic alignments with the quirks of the Electoral College and the shifting dynamics of candidates.",
        "If President Donald Trump follows through on his threat to end some crucial Obamacare payments to health insurers, he could actually end up costing the federal government billions of dollars. Trump has been making veiled threats against those subsidies, known as reductions, all month. They are payments that the federal government makes to health insurers because the plans are reducing costs, such as deductibles and copays, for Americans who buy insurance through Obamacare. But if Trump stopped the payments, the federal government could actually end up on the hook for quite a lot more \u2014 $2.",
        "On Monday, film and TV writers took the next step toward walking off sets all over the country \u2014 a move with big consequences for the entertainment industry. The Writers Guild of America (WGA) voted by a margin of 96 percent to authorize a strike. The numbers were first reported by Variety. In all, 6, 310 ballots were cast, and 67. 5 percent of eligible WGA membership voted.",
        "The Trump administration released a skeletal outline for tax reform on Wednesday, one that was almost entirely ripped from the president\u2019s campaign proposals and concentrated on reducing rates for corporations and high earners. The rollout focused on the easiest part of tax reform \u2014 cutting taxes \u2014 while avoiding the hard part: picking the losers of reform, who will see their taxes rise to offset the cuts. \u201cThey are telling them all the good news,\u201d says Michael Graetz, a tax law professor at Columbia University, \u201cbut there must be some bad news for someone.",
        "Wednesday afternoon, nearly the entire membership of the US Senate packed into a bus and headed to the White House grounds for an unprecedented classified briefing from top Trump administration officials on North Korea policy. Such a huge meeting, on such a volatile topic, had people wondering \u2014 was the United States about to announce some risky new policy on North Korea? Perhaps some kind of scary military escalation, or even a preemptive strike on a power? Nope. According to senators who attended the briefing, it was a whole lot of nothing.",
        "Jonathan Demme, the Academy Award \u2014 winning director who died Wednesday, April 26, at the age of 73, is probably best known for The Silence of the Lambs, which won him his Oscar. And yet the director wasn\u2019t known for making horror films or even thrillers.",
        "Ajit Pai, the new Republican chair of the Federal Communications Commission, has declared war on his predecessor\u2019s signature policy achievement: sweeping regulations to protect network neutrality, the idea that content and services online should compete on a level playing field. In a Wednesday speech in Washington, DC, Pai promised to roll back these rules, arguing that innovation will thrive with a more lightly regulated internet. \u201cWe need rules focused on growth and infrastructure investment, rules that expand investment everywhere,\u201d Pai said.",

        "A Republican legislator has vowed to close a loophole in his Obamacare replacement proposal, following Vox\u2019s reporting on the exemption Tuesday night. The amendment offered by Rep. Tom MacArthur ( ) would exempt health insurance plans held by legislators and their staff from key Obamacare repeal plans. Congressional staff are currently required to buy coverage through the Obamacare marketplaces. The amendment offered by Rep.",
        "On Wednesday, at a White House press briefing, National Economic Council Chair Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin unveiled the broad outlines of President Donald Trump\u2019s tax reform plan. The details were summarized in a single sheet of paper: Overall, it\u2019s a huge cut to corporate taxes and individual rates for high earners, with some significant cuts to deductions that are nowhere near enough to pay for it all. The plan is almost identical to the final plan Trump released on the campaign trail, a plan which would have cost $7.",

        "These are dark times for science \u2014 or at least that\u2019s what we keep hearing. President Trump is pushing to slash research budgets. Republicans in Congress are harassing climate scientists. Vaccine skeptics are clogging the airwaves. Indeed, a big reason why tens of thousands of scientists rallied in cities around the country last weekend was to counter what they see as \u201c \u201d attitudes taking hold in the United States \u2014 particularly in the US government.",

        "The Trump administration is weighing an executive order that could yank the US out of NAFTA and cause a potentially upheaval in trade relations across North America. Reports on the executive order have varied considerably in tone and substance. The Wall Street Journal reports that the White House is \u201cdebating\u201d a \u201cformal threat\u201d to withdraw from the free trade agreement.

        "In his latest assault on protections for federal lands, President Trump has just signed an executive order that calls for the review of all national monuments created in the past 20 years that are at least 100, 000 acres in size.

But on Wednesday, 22 Senate Democrats \u2014 including several party leaders \u2014 signed on to legislation that would raise the minimum wage to a $15 an hour by 2024.

Now, a version introduced by Senate Assistant Democratic Leader Patty Murray ( ) and Sanders has support from almost half of the caucus.",
