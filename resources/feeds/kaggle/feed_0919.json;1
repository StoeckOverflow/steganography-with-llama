        "A drug dealer tried an innovative legal strategy to defend his heroin business in court: He argued religious freedom laws protect him, because his religious beliefs drive him to sell heroin to people. Therefore, he claimed, the government shouldn\u2019t prosecute him for dealing heroin. On Wednesday, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals was clear about this interpretation of the law: No, that\u2019s not anywhere close to correct. The court summarized defendant Timothy Anderson\u2019s situation: Anderson filed a pretrial motion seeking dismissal of the indictment.",
        "Jonathan Demme, the director of The Silence of the Lambs, Philadelphia, Rachel Getting Married, and more, died Wednesday morning of esophageal cancer and complications from heart disease, reports Indiewire. He was 73. Demme\u2019s career is quietly astounding in its range and versatility. After breaking into feature filmmaking in the 1970s under the wing of maestro Roger Corman (with whom he and directed films like Angels Hard as They Come, Caged Heat, and Fighting Mad) Demme ascended to the plane of \u201ccritical darling\u201d with 1980s dramas like Melvin and Howard and Swing Shift.",
        "Last Thursday, on the in Paris, a single shooter killed a police officer named Xavier Jugel\u00e9 in the name of ISIS. For days, the news cycle \u2014 and President Trump \u2014 focused on how that terror attack would impact the French election. But the biggest impact was on one man, Etienne Cardiles, Jugel\u00e9\u2019s life partner. So it was fitting that for one moment yesterday, all eyes in Paris turned away from the results of the contentious French election and toward Cardiles, who gave an incredibly stoic, moving eulogy for his lost love.",
        "Suddenly, House Republicans sure seem like they are starting to move again on their previously stunted quest to repeal and replace Obamacare. Where that movement is actually heading is not yet clear. House Republicans do seem to be inching toward a deal that could get enough votes to pass an amended version of the American Health Care Act. On Wednesday afternoon, in a major breakthrough for the bill, the House Freedom Caucus \u2014 a bloc of three dozen archconservatives \u2014 collectively endorsed it.",
        "As we approach the 100th day of the Trump administration, America is intensely divided on political topics across the spectrum. And those divisions are playing out in classrooms, a sensitive battleground where issues like class, race, and gender converge. We collected stories from teachers around the country about how their students, their classroom environments, and their jobs have changed in the era of Trump. Some said they\u2019d noticed an uptick in racist language among students. Others mentioned criticism from parents that they were indoctrinating students in the classroom.",
        "For those who expected Hillary Clinton to win the 2016 presidential election, the fact that it was Donald Trump who pulled off the victory came as something of a shock. But for the people who make TV like Full Frontal With Samantha Bee \u2014 TBS\u2019s weekly shot of righteous liberal hellfire \u2014 there was barely a single minute to process what had just happened before they had to write and produce a whole new reaction for a whole new reality.",
        "Whatever the fate of the Republican bid to repeal and replace Obamacare, the most immediate threat to the law is President Donald Trump\u2019s ability to cut off key payments to insurance plans that reduce health care costs for millions of Americans. The White House amplified that threat Tuesday night, according to congressional Democratic aides. The administration is disputing that \u2014 sort of. But White House officials will not actually give any assurances that the payments will continue to be made.",
        "Every week, a few members of the Vox Culture team will gather to talk out the latest episode of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Hulu\u2019s adaptation of Margaret Atwood\u2019s 1985 novel. This week, staff writers Caroline Framke and Constance Grady discuss the first three episodes (\u201cOffred,\u201d \u201cBirth,\u201d and \u201cLate\u201d) which were released simultaneously on April 26. Caroline Framke: The Handmaid\u2019s Tale tells the kind of story that curls up in the pit of your stomach, settles into a gnarled knot, and stays for a long, long while.",
        "Wednesday night, text leaked of a new Republican amendment to the party\u2019s health care bill, the American Health Care Act, which was part of an ongoing effort to revive the bill in the House. The amendment would allow states to opt out of some politically popular Obamacare provisions, like the requirement to charge sick people the same prices as healthy people, or to cover a core set of benefits. Health law expert Tim Jost called me when he noticed something surprising on the sixth page of the amendment: an exemption for the health insurance of legislators and their staff.",
        "Alex Jones and his persona suffered a blow in a Texas court room yesterday. The conspiracy theorist, who counts President Donald Trump among his fans, wrapped up a trial for an ongoing custody battle with his Kelly Jones. At the center of the trial was the question of whether Jones\u2019s shtick is, well, for real, and affected his ability to be a good father to his three children. The jury decided it is, awarding Kelly Jones control over the decision about where the children live.",
        "Multiple media outlets, including Vox, have reported the terrifying statistics: The opioid epidemic has led to the deadliest drug crisis in US history \u2014 deadlier than the crack epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s. Drug overdoses now cause more deaths than gun violence and car crashes. They even caused more deaths in 2015 than did at the height of the epidemic in 1995. A new study, however, suggests that we may be in fact underestimating the death toll of the opioid epidemic and current drug crisis. And we don\u2019t even know by how much.",
        "When Margaret Atwood published The Handmaid\u2019s Tale in 1985, she created one of America\u2019s most enduring dystopian myths. The book, which will be adapted into a TV series on Hulu this April, takes place in a America \u2014 now called Gilead \u2014 governed by a religious group. In Gilead, a small group of straight, wealthy white men hold all the power. People of color have been relocated to internment camps or deported. Gay people are executed. Religious heretics are tortured into conversion or executed. It\u2019s illegal for women to read or hold property in Gilead.",
        "Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin is suggesting that the border adjustment might not be dead yet. The controversial tax provision, proposed by House Republicans to offset lost revenue from corporate rate cuts, didn\u2019t have much support from the Senate. President Trump didn\u2019t like it either. And retailers hated the idea, because it taxes imported goods while exempting exports from taxes. But so far it has been the only major proposal to counterbalance the trillions of dollars in lost revenue that will result from tax cuts.",
        "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is like listening to your favorite Fleetwood Mac song, while traversing a rainbow on a unicorn that fires glitter from its butt and laser beams from its eyeballs. It\u2019s an awful lot. At times it\u2019s overwhelming. But it is, without a doubt, awesome. On the surface, Guardians 2 might seem like any other film on Marvel\u2019s assembly line: Heroes come together to defeat a villain who has the power to take over the universe. Director James Gunn understands this.",
        "We\u2019ve gotten used to transportation technology improving at a glacial pace. Today\u2019s cars and airplanes look and work about the same as they did 25 and even 50 years ago. But two announcements this week made it clear that the pace of innovation in transportation is about to accelerate dramatically. On Monday, Google\u2019s Waymo unit announced it was opening its car program to members of the general public in Phoenix. Waymo has ordered 500 Chrysler Pacifica minivans and will provide free rides to hundreds of customers who are accepted into the company\u2019s pilot program.",
        "Every week, some of Vox\u2019s writers will gather to discuss the latest episode of FX\u2019s spy drama The Americans. This week, critic at large Todd VanDerWerff, associate editor Libby Nelson, and staff writer Alissa Wilkinson talk about \u201cImmersion,\u201d the eighth episode of season five. Todd VanDerWerff: Because I was on vacation when they aired, I watched the sixth and seventh episodes of this season of The Americans right on top of each other, immediately before watching this eighth episode.",
        "[Editor\u2019s note: On Tuesday, President Trump fired FBI James Comey, stating in his letter to Comey that he had accepted the recommendation of Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General that Comey was \u201cno longer able to effectively lead the Bureau. \u201d In a memo released publicly along with that letter, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein laid out the case for Comey\u2019s dismissal. Writing to his boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Rosenstein focused on \u201cthe Director\u2019s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton\u2019s emails. \u201d Rosenstein made several criticisms of Comey\u2019s conduct.",
        "Donald Trump owns hotels, resorts, golf courses, and much more. The Trump Organization is the private company in the US, and brought in $9. 5 billion in revenue last year. It is by no means a small company. But the Trump Organization doesn\u2019t pay taxes like a big corporation. That\u2019s because it\u2019s a special kind of entity called a \u201d \u201d business. The designation was originally for owners to bypass corporate taxes and only pay the individual tax rate. Now huge corporations are also taking advantage. But as president, Trump may go further to help himself.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s White House is obsessed with how its first 100 days will be scored in the media. It\u2019s an absurd, arbitrary marker, and Trump himself has even said so. But he\u2019s the most president of all time, and the Trump White House is very concerned about how it will be graded on its first 100 days. Trump himself has called the marker \u201cridiculous.",
        "Elizabeth Warren is the founder of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the senior senator from Massachusetts, and the author of the new book This Fight is Our Fight. You might have heard of her. Warren is also one of the Democrats most capable of defining the Democratic Party\u2019s soul and message in a era. In her book, she says she had at least one big disagreement with President Obama \u2014 a disagreement that speaks to the direction she wants to lead the party. So we began there. (This interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
        "The challenge for Congress this week is to avoid a government shutdown. Considering that President Trump\u2019s own party controls both the House and the Senate, the possibility of a basic inability to keep the government running seems like an astonishing feat. And even if a shutdown is averted, as seems likely at this point, it\u2019s clear that year after year, the routine work of keeping the annual appropriations cycle going is getting harder and harder. It\u2019s easy to blame Trump as a particularly meddlesome actor in all this, but it\u2019s about a lot more than the specific personalities involved.",
        "Lauren Singer lives a nearly life. How near? Her total trash for the past four years fits into a single Mason jar. If that makes you sputter with disbelief, you\u2019re not alone. Singer\u2019s lifestyle provokes strong reactions: Some people think it\u2019s great and want to learn how she does it, some insist that she\u2019s a fake, and others respond like her way of life is somehow an attack on theirs. \u201cThey feel like they\u2019re under a microscope, like the fabric of what they believe in is being threatened,\u201d she said. Singer experienced this reaction close to home.",
        "The opioid epidemic in the US can sometimes seem like a giant game of for health officials \u2014 look away and the epidemic shifts. More people still overdose on prescription painkillers than any other opioid, but heroin and other illicit opioids like fentanyl are now fueling a separate, and perhaps even deadlier, drug epidemic. And it turns out there are now big differences between age groups when it comes to opioid overdoses.",
        "Back in October, Alec MacGillis penned a provocative New York Times opinion piece titled \u201cGo Midwest, Young Hipster. \u201d The argument was straightforward. Young educated progressives were fleeing their hometowns in places like Iowa and Ohio for thriving cities like San Francisco and New York City \u2014 but those moves had profound political consequences. New York and San Francisco are already cities in states, and so while the emigres might increase the margin by which a Democratic senator or Congress member might win, they would be unlikely to change the results.",
        "On April 12, the New York Times\u2019s vaunted editorial page got a new addition. Bret Stephens, formerly a columnist at the Wall Street Journal, will join Ross Douthat and David Brooks among the stable of conservatives at the Gray Lady. It\u2019s a decision that infuriated many of the paper\u2019s liberal readers. Stephens may be a vocal critic of Donald Trump, but his views are firmly .",
        "One in nearly 4. 8 million. That\u2019s how many fraudulent votes North Carolina\u2019s voter ID law would have stopped in the 2016 election had it not been halted by the US Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, based on a recent audit from the State Board of Elections. After all this time, the court battles, and the protests that the law would disproportionately hurt minority voters, it turns out the push for voter ID was all to stop just one potentially fraudulent vote out of 4, 769, 640 cast last November.",
        "Update: After Vox reported this story, Rep. Tom MacArthur ( . J.) released a statement saying he would close this loophole. Read the story here. The fix, however, will be contained in separate legislation and not offered as part of the American Health Care Act. The version of the bill the House will vote on Thursday still contains the exemption for legislators described below. House Republicans appear to have included a provision that exempts members of Congress and their staff from their latest health care plan.",
        "The Defense Department\u2019s inspector general is investigating whether former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn improperly took money from foreign governments after retiring from the Army, the latest sign that the disgraced retired general could be in serious legal trouble. The investigation was made public Thursday as part of a set of documents released by Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.",
        "We\u2019ve long known that despite all our efforts to clean up lead, we have a serious problem with lead poisoning in American children \u2014 it\u2019s an egregious and preventable public health issue that just won\u2019t go away. And it seems the problem is even worse than we thought. Researchers at the Public Health Institute\u2019s California Environmental Health Tracking Program, reported Thursday in the journal Pediatrics that the overall number of children with elevated blood lead levels as of in the US was 1. 2 million, or double what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had reported.",
        "In 2013, Time magazine ran a cover story titled Google vs. Death about Calico, a health venture focused on understanding aging \u2014 and how to beat it. \u201cWe should shoot for the things that are really, really important, so 10 or 20 years from now we have those things done,\u201d Google CEO Larry Page told Time. But how exactly would Calico help humans live longer, healthier lives? How would it invest its vast $1. 5 billion pool of money?"
