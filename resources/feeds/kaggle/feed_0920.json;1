        "On Wednesday, April 26, the Cassini spacecraft did something extraordinary: It slipped through the gap between Saturn and its rings, becoming the first spacecraft ever to explore this region. The trip took it closer to the top of Saturn\u2019s atmosphere than any spacecraft had been before. And, yes, there are pictures. On Thursday, NASA released these unprocessed images from Cassini. (Unprocessed means dust and other photographic artifacts are still in the shot.) What they represent is extraordinary: photographs taken just 1, 900 miles above Saturn\u2019s atmosphere, while traveling at a speed of 77, 000 mph relative to Saturn.",
        "The latest attempt by a major beverage company to wade into the turbulent sociopolitical climate through advertising is being met with significantly more praise than Pepsi\u2019s recent botched attempt with Kendall Jenner. Heineken\u2019s new \u201cWorlds Apart\u201d ad, released April 20, asks a simple but fraught question: Can people on opposite ends of the world\u2019s increasingly polarized ideological spectrum come together to talk about their differences and have a beer? The ad has won significant praise from many viewers and members of the media who argue its model for encouraging discussion can work in daily life.",
        "The Trump administration, with great fanfare, rolled out a new tax plan on Wednesday. It was neither particularly new nor truly a \u201cplan,\u201d at least not in the way that word is typically used in presidential politics. It actually tells us less about where Trump wants to take the tax code than his campaign plan did, which bodes poorly for anyone who hoped Trump was serious about a sweeping, overhaul of the system.",
        "It\u2019s 2075 and America is sunk deep in its second civil war. Everything has gone to hell.",

        "When the Federal Communications Commission established strong network neutrality rules in 2015, its leading critic was Ajit Pai, a member of the commission\u2019s Republican minority. Now under Donald Trump, Pai is leading the FCC, and on Wednesday he announced plans to scrap those protections. But critics of network neutrality rules shouldn\u2019t be celebrating too much, because there won\u2019t be a Republican in the White House forever. The next time a Democrat wins the presidency, we can expect the FCC to bring network neutrality regulations right back.",

Sign up to get VoxCare in your inbox here.

        "President Trump\u2019s comments make it seem like the United States holds all the cards when it comes to the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump repeatedly described the trade deal as being the \u201cworst\u201d ever, blaming it on encouraging American companies to move factories south of the border. When Politico reported Wednesday on a possible executive order to get out of NAFTA, it was later framed as an internal battle between economic nationalists and \u201cglobalists\u201d in the White House.",
        "Tyler Clementi was just a few weeks into his first semester at Rutgers University in September 2010 when his roommate used a webcam to stream \u2014 without Clementi\u2019s knowledge \u2014 live video of Clementi kissing another man, launching a wave of ridicule and shaming online. A few days later, Clementi went to the George Washington Bridge, jumped off, and died. Now, a Democratic group of lawmakers in Congress is pushing a bill that, they hope, will help prevent this kind of bullying from happening again.",
        "French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen\u2019s success in the first round of elections was widely attributed to her effort to \u201cdetoxify\u201d her National Front party of the that marked its past, and to root out Holocaust minimizers from its leadership. There was even a French word coined for the effort, d\u00e9diabolisation \u2014 literally, \u201cundemonization.",
        "Nearly all of Neil Gaiman\u2019s books have a moment where the narrator steps back, looks at the reader knowingly, and says, \u201cYou get that this is a metaphor, right?\u201d In Stardust, Fairy is a metaphor for story; in Neverwhere, London Below is a metaphor for the unknown. And as you\u2019re nodding and saying, \u201cYes, I took high school English, I see what you\u2019re doing here,\u201d the narrator will add, \u201cBut also it\u2019s real,\u201d and then drop you back into the story as if you never left.",
        "Donald Trump has been in office long enough now to make his leadership style clear. There\u2019s the chaos and daily mini scandals, the rumors and intrigues, the bewildering fire hose of clickbait, yes. But in terms of actual governance, what Trump has done so far can be summed up in two words: lazy and plutocratic. Trump has always been a performer above all, hungry for approval and ratings. He was performing throughout his candidacy and seems interested mostly in performing the presidency. That is very, very different from being a good president.",
        "Elisabeth Moss gives what might be the TV performance of the year in Hulu\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. The actress is probably best known for her work as Peggy Olson on AMC\u2019s drama Mad Men. In her new role, she plays the character of Offred \u2014 a woman forced to live as a \u201chandmaid\u201d and valued only for her fertility \u2014 in the alternate reality of the series, which is based on Margaret Atwood\u2019s classic 1985 novel. Much of the adaptation is filmed in extremely intimate on Moss\u2019s face, leaving her no room for anything false.",
        "The House of Representatives has made a move to avert a government shutdown with only days before Congress\u2019s April 28 spending deadline. As it stands, Congress has until midnight on Friday to pass a spending bill or the government will run out of money and shut down. But late Wednesday night, Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen ( ) who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, introduced a continuing resolution to provide one week of stopgap funding, effectively extending the shutdown deadline to May 5, to buy Congress more time to negotiate a spending bill.",
        "Fox News\u2019s decision to fire Bill O\u2019Reilly over his history of sexual harassment allegations is a big deal. O\u2019Reilly has been the most influential voice on cable news for years, and it took significant pressure from advertisers to finally get Fox to part ways with their star. In an internal memo explaining the decision to fire O\u2019Reilly, Fox News\u2019s owners stated their \u201cconsistent commitment to fostering a work environment built on the values of trust and respect. \u201d The problem is: O\u2019Reilly\u2019s replacements aren\u2019t much of an improvement.",
        "Unless and until Congress enacts a replacement for the Affordable Care Act, President Trump will be stuck implementing a law he detests. He has predicted that \u201cObamaCare will explode,\u201d and in his frustration he will be sorely tempted to do everything in his power to make that prediction come true. He may still have his chance. A pending court case, House v. Price (n\u00e9e House v. Burwell \u2014 and much turns on the name change) has given the administration a bomb it could use to blow up insurance markets across the country.",
        "There\u2019s a way for White House aides or other administration officials to roll a president into approving a preferred policy of theirs while letting him think he\u2019s still in charge. They present him with three options: one of which is obviously too extreme, one of which is far too weak, and the third of which is just right. This last one, not so coincidentally, is what the advisers wanted all along. Clever, right?",
        "British Columbia\u2019s premier, Christy Clark, has an idea for Canada to hit back at President Trump\u2019s new softwood lumber tariffs in a way that microtargets his political base \u2014 banning thermal coal exports from her province\u2019s ports. The ports themselves are under federal jurisdiction, so it would be up to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau whether to try for this action. But Clark explained during a press conference Wednesday at a paper mill and separately in a letter to Trudeau that she thinks the time is right for a move she claims to have long favored on environmental grounds.",
        "The recent election in France has, once again, raised questions about the political fate of Europe \u2014 and of the West more generally. In France, the election results were more or less what pollsters expected: Centrist independent Emmanuel Macron and populist Marine Le Pen advanced to the second and final round of voting. Macron and Le Pen have almost nothing in common, save for their outsider status. Like many recent elections across Europe, particularly the Brexit referendum, this was less about economic issues and more about a deep cultural divide.",
        "Back when the world was new, there was a young woman whose only dream in life was for everyone to know her name. Though she would eventually marry wealthy, the desire to be famous still burned in her veins. She prayed every night. The gods, feeling itchy and bored one day, noticed this young woman\u2019s yearning. One offered her a proposition: If she sacrificed her daughter, everyone would know her name. The woman agreed without hesitation \u2014 she had many daughters after all. The god smiled and gave her a potion. \u201cYour face will never age.",
        "During her senior year at Vassar, Heather Kobayashi attended a campus recruitment event for Epic, a health record software company based near Madison, Wisconsin. \u201cI just went for the free pizza, but then I heard them saying, \u2018You don\u2019t need experience in health care; we\u2019re looking for people who are eager to learn,\u2019\u201d she said. When Kobayashi started working at Epic the following summer, she joined the company at the same time as hundreds of other graduates. Moving to Madison, she hardly knew anyone, and immediately befriended the people in her class.",
        "Most rich countries besides the US have hit on a surprisingly simple approach to reducing child poverty: just giving parents money. This idea, known as a child benefit or child allowance, exists in almost every EU country as well as in Canada and Australia. In many countries, the payments are truly universal; you get the money no matter how much you earn. In others, like Canada, the payments phase out for top earners but almost everyone else benefits.",
        "\u201dThere is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea,\u201d President Donald Trump told Reuters in an interview published on Friday morning. \u201cAbsolutely. \u201d It was a frightening capstone to the past two days in Trumpland, which have been dominated by North Korea policy. But happily, there\u2019s less to it than meets the eye: The Trump administration is currently giving every indication that it doesn\u2019t want to use force against North Korea. The issue, though, is that we have no clue what it actually does want to do.",
        "Trump\u2019s first 100 days have seen him achieve a relatively small number of his stated goals. Sure, there have been some regulatory rollbacks, an immigration crackdown, and a Supreme Court confirmation. But otherwise Trump has endured court rulings frustrating his efforts to crack down on \u201csanctuary cities\u201d and travel from Muslim countries, and has gotten next to nothing accomplished in Congress. That being said, the first 100 days definitely left some political actors better off than others. Here\u2019s who finished the period better than they started it, and who took some hits.",
        "Attendees seem to have had a terrible time at Fyre Fest, the disastrous Bahaman music festival that turned out to be a shoddily produced fiasco that had to be canceled a few hours in. But gawkers on the internet have subsequently had a great time mocking the chaos on social media.",
        "A major premise of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign was that as a successful businessman, he would be \u201cgreedy\u201d on behalf of America. But instead, his CEO mindset has generated one of the least productive first 100 days of a presidency in modern American history. On his march to the White House, Trump frequently touted his prowess as a formidable dealmaker and efficient businessman as what was needed to turn around a stagnating nation. \u201dUnder budget and ahead of schedule. So important.",
        "From the moment he made it his central campaign proposal to build a wall on the border (and make Mexico pay for it) Donald Trump signed up his hypothetical administration to fight for its construction. \u201cBuild the wall!\u201d became a chant everywhere from campaign rallies to high school basketball games. The wall arguably handed Trump his biggest win \u2014 the presidency itself. It could turn out to be one of his biggest failures. The fundamental problem is that very few people in the Republican Party affirmatively want a literal, physical concrete wall across the border.",
        "North Korea is a notoriously secretive place that is often hostile to outsiders, especially Western journalists. Which means that getting an unfiltered, unvarnished look at everyday life inside the Hermit Kingdom is incredibly rare. Most of what the outside world gets to see is carefully crafted regime propaganda or the occasional heavily edited, stylized documentary. That\u2019s what makes this short video by Finnish journalist Mika M\u00e4kel\u00e4inen so fascinating.",
        "The annual White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner is happening again Saturday, and it\u2019ll be, well, something else. For the past eight years, the dinner has marked a weekend of parties feting President Barack Obama (and, nominally, the press). But with Donald Trump in the Oval Office, the forecast is decidedly less glamorous \u2014 starting with the main event, which is expected to strike a more serious tone this year in the absence of its guest of honor.",
