Sign up to get VoxCare in your inbox here. There are plenty of reasons Republicans can offer right now about why they can\u2019t repeal Obamacare, such as the peculiar Senate rules that govern reconciliation, or the difficulty of drafting the actual legislation. Byron York, however, offers today what is arguably the Occam\u2019s razor theory of Obamacare repeal, the simplest explanation of why Republicans haven\u2019t overturned President Obama\u2019s health care law.",
        "North Korea has been showing off its latest range of ballistic missiles by launching them into the Sea of Japan and parading them around. The missiles appear to be getting more advanced \u2014 and that has a lot of people wondering how far these missiles can go. This map, released by the Center for Strategic and International Studies Missile Defense Project, is helpful in understanding what kind of missiles North Korea has and how far it could potentially deliver a nuclear strike. But it doesn\u2019t tell the full story as of right now.",
        "The Commerce Department released estimates Friday showing that the economy is growing more slowly than it has in years. For the first quarter of 2017, it grew a measly 0. 7 percent, the worst growth since . Economists had been hoping that sluggish economic growth would start to pick up by now as more people find work and wages increase, plus an optimism boost from the Trump administration\u2019s promise to cut taxes. Two months ago, they\u2019d predicted a slight uptick to 2 percent growth. The main reason for the decline seems to be a drop in consumer spending.",
        "Apparently threatening to crackdown on one Korea wasn\u2019t enough. While warning of a potential \u201cmajor, major conflict\u201d with North Korea during a Reuters interview on Thursday, President Donald Trump made it clear that he was also planning to take a hard line with South Korea over trade and the cost of deploying an advanced defense system to the close US ally.",
        "On Saturday, the People\u2019s Climate March will take to the streets because \u201ceverything we have struggled to move forward in the United States is in peril,\u201d according to the march\u2019s organizers. But how much progress has there really been, in the United States, to reduce the impact of human activities on the climate? What are these great accomplishments that are \u201cin peril\u201d? Fewer than many activists on the left, particularly supporters of President Obama, would like to admit.",
        "The government isn\u2019t shutting down, or at least not for a week. Congress passed a temporary funding bill Friday just hours ahead of the midnight deadline when the government would have run out of money. The new deadline is May 5. Congress couldn\u2019t strike a deal on a larger bill to fund the government for fiscal year 2017, so they bought some time with the called a \u201ccontinuing resolution. \u201d The problem is the extra week doesn\u2019t change the politics.",
        "President Donald Trump wants to take America back to the 1980s and \u201990s. At least, that\u2019s what Trump and his administration have indicated through their rhetoric and policy proposals regarding crime. Over the first 100 days of the new presidency, Trump and his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, have accomplished little on specific criminal justice policy.",
        "It became clear around 11 am that the Helena Capitol building was far too small for all the demonstrators who showed up. Every balcony in the rotunda was full. People spilled out of the room and into the hallways. When we chanted, the building shook. We were there on a cold January day to protest various attempts by the federal government to sell public lands to private companies and individuals. One bill on the immediate horizon was HR621, the Disposal of Excess Federal Lands Act of 2017.",
        "Coal has always had strong cultural resonance in the US. In his campaign, Donald Trump seized on that resonance with an odd kind of fervor, using miners as props in political rallies and promising, again and again, to put them back to work. He has managed to make the fate of coal miners a synecdoche for the fate of the white working class writ large.",
        "The thing to know going into Casting JonBen\u00e9t is that you won\u2019t get any answers. And according to director Kitty Green, that\u2019s exactly the point. The sensational, case of the beauty queen found murdered in her family\u2019s home on Christmas night in 1996 is a popular subject for filmmakers looking to capitalize on the current taste for \u201ctrue crime\u201d documentaries and docudramas. After all, the story dominated tabloids for months, and was almost as famous as the O. J.",
        "Since its founding in 2012, the \u201cmen\u2019s rights\u201d subreddit has become one of the most notorious forums in Reddit\u2019s history, widely known as a misogynistic cesspool in which men deride feminist ideologies and mock rape victims. An appropriation of The Matrix\u2019s concept of \u201ctaking the red pill,\u201d members of the forum argue that men need to \u201cwake up\u201d to a reality in which feminism has ruined their lives. Now it appears the foundational beliefs of TheRedPill could be directly impacting politics in at least one state.",
        "A friend characterized Sleight to me as J. D. Dillard\u2019s calling card movie, designed and shot for him to drop it straight onto Marvel\u2019s doorstep in the hopes of getting a superhero movie to direct. My friend wasn\u2019t wrong. But if Dillard\u2019s plan works, I\u2019ll be glad. Sleight is a rare animal: an intimate drama for starring a black teenager that doubles as a cool superhero origin story. And there are magic tricks, too!",
        "The American people are warning Donald Trump about ET and Superman. That\u2019s probably not what the president of the United States had in mind when this week he set up a hotline for the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement office (VOICE) meant to record and report crimes by \u201cillegal aliens. \u201d But many people opposed to Trump and his immigration policies have taken a creative interpretation of \u201cillegal aliens\u201d \u2014 to include, of course, space aliens. Wouldn\u2019t it be a shame if millions of people called this hotline to report their encounters with aliens of the . https: .",
        "On January 17, just three days before the inauguration, a reporter for Israel\u2019s largest newspaper approached Donald Trump at a event to ask about his promise to break with decades of bipartisan foreign policy and move the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. \u201cOf course I remember what I said about Jerusalem,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cYou know that I am not a person who breaks promises. \u201d Except, of course, when he does.",
        "The Circle is a bafflingly bad movie. Baffling, because all of its ingredients are so promising. Director James Ponsoldt makes good movies, like The End of the Tour and The Spectacular Now. He the screenplay with Dave Eggers, who wrote the novel on which the film is based. It stars Emma Watson and Tom Hanks and an interesting supporting cast \u2014 Ellar Coltrane, John Boyega, Nate Corddry, Bill Paxton (in his final film role) Karen Gillan, Patton Oswalt. Danny Elfman wrote the score. I mean, Beck performs on stage during the movie.",
        "When Donald Trump called the 100 days mark for judging a presidency a \u201cridiculous standard,\u201d he was echoing what historians have said for years. If anything, he could have gone further. The habit of weighing a president\u2019s success 100 days in is a blight on the modern presidency, as pointless as it is impossible to uproot. Journalists will never dump the convention, because it\u2019s such an easy hook. Politicians will never dump it, because in the middle of a campaign it\u2019s too tempting to reel off a wish list for their first days in the White House.",
        "As President Donald Trump has tried to make his mark in his first 100 days of office, TV hosts have scrambled to both decode and send up a man they once treated as nothing more than a tired toupee joke. Every weeknight, these men and one woman continue to spit punchlines acid in the face of the new administration. Some have risen to the occasion with barbs blazing; others have taken a step back.",
        "Donald Trump did not realize how much work being president of the United States would be. Really. In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Trump reflected on the joys of his previous life. He misses being able to drive, having privacy, and having an easier job. \u201dI loved my previous life. I had so many things going,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview. \u201dThis is more work than in my previous life. I thought it would be easier.\u201d \u201dYou\u2019re really into your own little cocoon, because you have such massive protection that you really can\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d he continued.",
        "Donald Trump was elected, in part, because he promised to shake things up. In October, he even posted a \u201d Plan to Make America Great Again.\u201d The list included, among other things, repealing and replacing Obamacare and cleaning up corruption in Washington. So, just a few days shy of the mark, what can we say? Was Trump the agent of change he vowed to be? The simple answer is no. With the exception of appointing a Supreme Court justice and opting out of the Partnership, Trump has failed to deliver on most of his promises.",
        "Dear White People opens with an \u201cethnic but nonthreatening\u201d voiceover that promises to catch us up on the action at Winchester College, a fictionalized Ivy League school trying to hide problems with institutional racism beneath layers of prestige. The point of this voiceover, the narrator (Giancarlo Esposito) announces with an audible grin, is to provide a kind of shortcut into the story. Thankfully, this turns out to be completely misleading. Justin Simien\u2019s new Netflix show \u2014 the TV version of his 2014 movie of the same name \u2014 doesn\u2019t take shortcuts.",
        "On April 29, the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, as it has every year since 1921, will host its annual dinner in Washington, DC, to honor members of the press. Also on April 29, less than two miles away, Full Frontal host Samantha Bee will hold a rival event to, as a press release put it, \u201cfinally answer the question, \u2018What if Washington D. C.\u2019s annual nerd prom were hosted by a lady nerd and had way more curse words?",
        "On the morning of November 9, 2016, the possibilities seemed endless. Donald Trump had won the presidency. The Republican Party controlled both houses of Congress. The world, it appeared, was their oyster. Eight years of President Obama\u2019s legacy were about to be erased, and GOP policy priorities were about to become the law of the land. And Trump didn\u2019t want to stop there. He had run on a promise to transform American politics, rejecting much of the conventional wisdom from both establishment Democrats and establishment Republicans.",
        "President Donald Trump is skipping nerd prom. The White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner in Washington, DC, dubbed \u201cnerd prom,\u201d is on Saturday, April 29, at 9:30 pm at the Washington Hilton Hotel. In Washington, the event is the media\u2019s annual brush with glamour and celebrity. It has become the political extension of Hollywood, with preparties and afterparties and tables filled with the country\u2019s most powerful politicians and popular film and TV stars. Presidents often enlist comedians to polish their jokes.",
        "Donald Trump attracted a reputation over the years as a ruthless and unscrupulous businessman. He said on the campaign trail that having been \u201cgreedy all my life,\u201d he now wanted to be greedy on behalf of the American people \u2014 but nobody seriously believed him. Marco Rubio warned that Trump was a \u201ccon artist,\u201d and Ted Cruz labeled him \u201ccompletely amoral. \u201d Liberals, needless to say, were not kinder in their judgments.",
        "At first glance, Trump voters and Clinton voters appear sharply divided on how they view Trump\u2019s handling of the presidency so far. percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump approve of his performance, according to a poll of more than 1, 000 Americans conducted in early April. Among Clinton voters, it couldn\u2019t be more different \u2014 93 percent disapprove of his performance. But when you talk to the people behind these numbers, there\u2019s a more complicated picture. Some Trump voters expressed doubts about the president they threw their support behind in the survey.",
        "Donald Trump brags about eating fast food. Michelle Obama planted a vegetable garden at the White House. Now it seems Trump is quietly trying to overtake the former first lady\u2019s vision for the future of food in America. Great afternoon in Ohio & a great evening in Pennsylvania departing now. See you tomorrow Virginia! pic. twitter. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 2, 2016 Michelle Obama had a strikingly successful record of fighting the obesity epidemic and improving nutrition \u2014 both symbolically and through advocacy for legislation.",
        "After months of being slammed by President Donald Trump himself for dealing in \u201cfake news\u201d and being a literal enemy of the American people, the media was honored on Saturday at Samantha Bee\u2019s \u201cNot the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner\u201d \u2014 a love letter of sorts to America\u2019s beleaguered journalists. Or to most of them, anyway.",
        "Early Saturday afternoon on the National Mall, as the temperature approached 90 degrees, thousands began marching from the Capitol to the White House. When they got there, they surrounded President Donald Trump\u2019s residence and sat down for 100 seconds to protest his first 100 days of office \u2014 and his administration\u2019s brutal environmental policy so far. Along the way, they passed the Trump International Hotel DC, shouting, \u201dWe will not go away. Welcome to your 100th day.\u201d Compared with last weekend\u2019s March for Science, Saturday\u2019s \u201cPeople\u2019s Climate March\u201d was more explicitly more intersectional, and more social justice oriented.",
        "\u201cThis has been one of the strangest events I\u2019ve ever done in my life,\u201d Daily Show correspondent Hasan Minhaj said late in his set at Saturday\u2019s White House Correspondent\u2019s Dinner, before going on to say he felt like a tribute in the Hunger Games, waiting to see \u201cif Steve Bannon is going to eat me. \u201d It was part of a good, but odd, performance from the comedian, who was hampered by the fact that the person he spent the most time making fun of \u2014 President Donald Trump himself \u2014 wasn\u2019t in the room.",
        "Last weekend\u2019s March for Science brought a renewed sense of purpose and urgency to Earth Day \u2014 and the momentum should carry on at Saturday\u2019s People\u2019s Climate Movement March. Collectively, these mass demonstrations \u2014 the March for Science alone attracted more than 15, 000 people to DC and thousands more in satellite cities \u2014 send a clear message that President Trump\u2019s assault on the basic tenets of science on numerous fronts is among his most unforgivable sins of willful fiction."
