        "Last month, President Trump issued a executive order dismantling President Obama\u2019s restrictions on carbon pollution \u2014 part of his broader assault on Obama\u2019s environmental legacy. Today, the People\u2019s Climate March is happening in DC \u2014 and in sister rallies around the world. So it\u2019s a good time to have another look at public opinion on climate change. As I have written before (see here and here) there is a deep and abiding partisan divide in opinion on global warming. That divide has held steady for decades now, through shifting weather, political administrations, and cultural moods.",
        "American Airlines agreed this week to do something nice for its employees and arguably foresighted for its business by giving flight attendants and pilots a preemptive raise, in order to close a gap that had opened up between their compensation and the compensation paid by rival airlines Delta and United. Wall Street freaked out, sending American shares plummeting. After all, this is capitalism and the capital owners are supposed to reap the rewards of business success. \u201cThis is frustrating. Labor is being paid first again,\u201d wrote Citi analyst Kevin Crissey in a widely circulated note. \u201cShareholders get leftovers.",
        "This week, Alain de Botton \u2014 author, philosopher, and founder of the School of Life \u2014 answers our questions. What\u2019s the first piece of media you consume every day? I read the Guardian online and check my Twitter feed. These are probably very bad habits. Name a writer or publication you disagree with but still read. It\u2019s very gratifying to grow utterly incensed by the Mail Online and come away from it full of fury and absolute outrage at its prejudice and xenophobia \u2014 and support for Brexit.",
        "Every weekend, we pick a movie you can stream that dovetails with current events. Old, new, blockbuster, arthouse: They\u2019re all fair game. What you can count on is a weekend watch that sheds new light on the week that was. The movie of the week for April 29 through May 5 is Rachel Getting Married, which is available to digitally rent on Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, YouTube, and Vudu. On Wednesday, the beloved film director Jonathan Demme died at the age of 73.",
        "Nature documentaries are full of little tricks to grab viewers\u2019 attention. In the video above, filmmaker Simon Cade (of DSLRguide) walks us through some of the techniques nature documentaries use to get viewers hooked \u2014 even if it means taking some, well, artistic liberties. Consider the sounds of a documentary. As Cade explains, there\u2019s a basic problem with how nature documentaries are filmed: \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to record sound when you are far away from something. Cameras can zoom in, but the microphones can\u2019t. \u201d Cade gives the example of filming a wolf hunting from a helicopter.",
        "Welcome to Vox\u2019s weekly book link roundup, a curated selection of the week\u2019s best writing on books and related subjects. Here is the best the internet has to offer for the week of April 24, 2017. At the Atlantic, James Somers tells the story of how we almost got instant digital access to the library of Alexandria \u2014 and then didn\u2019t: You were going to get access to the full text of nearly every book that\u2019s ever been published.",
        "President Donald Trump is barreling into his 100th day in office, and the federal government remains a operation. There are 549 key positions in Trump\u2019s administration that require Senate confirmation. Trump has yet to nominate anyone to 468 of them. \u201cYou can\u2019t run everything through a single small pipe and expect to get the business of government done,\u201d says Max Stier, the CEO of the nonpartisan Center for Presidential Transition, which works with both parties to think through staffing government positions.",
        "Beyonc\u00e9 is on a quest to change how the world sees pregnancy. Along the way, she\u2019s nudging us to consider the biases pregnant black women face, and the startling gap between black and white women when it comes to maternal health. On the first day of Black History Month, the performer revealed she was pregnant with twins \u2014 looking like a goddess against a backdrop of hearts and flowers in an Instagram photo that evoked Virgin Mary imagery. We would like to share our love and happiness. We have been blessed two times over.",
        "President Donald Trump gave a lengthy interview Sunday morning to CBS\u2019s John Dickerson about the Republicans\u2019 health care plan. His responses to basic questions \u2014 like what provisions the bill includes or how it would change the health insurance system \u2014 suggest he either doesn\u2019t understand how the American Health Care Act works, or doesn\u2019t want to tell the truth about it.

        "President Trump\u2019s rally in Pennsylvania Saturday night was a classic Trump campaign stop. He attacked the media, snarled about the Washington \u201cswamp,\u201d stoked fears about illegal immigrants, and promised a future in which \u201cdying factories will come roaring back to life. \u201d It also featured a special twist to mark Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office: an alternative telling of his presidency so far, in which all of his policy plans are well on track. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve delivered is 100 days of action,\u201d Trump told thousands of supporters at the Farm Show building in Harrisburg.",
        "Every Sunday, we pick a new episode of the week. It could be good. It could be bad. It will always be interesting. You can read the archives here. The episode of the week for April 23 through 29 is \u201cA Cricket and a Hedge Made of Gold,\u201d the 20th episode of the fourth season of CBS\u2019s Mom. The sitcom is not known for being messy. The situations are compact, easy to deal with in 25 minutes or less. The studio audience is there to deflate any tension that arises with perfectly placed laughter.",
        "In most parts of the country, May is when spring really unfurls her full beauty, beckoning us to emerge from our homes and step into the fragrant sunlight. Don\u2019t be fooled. There are far too many great movies and TV series premiering on streaming this month to waste time enjoying the . There are recent intriguing original films, new seasons of acclaimed original series, a handful of worthy cult curiosities, and one of the most anticipated TV returns in recent memory, just waiting for you on your streaming platforms of choice.",
        "Starz\u2019s American Gods erupts onscreen in gushes of blood and sex and storms that crack the sky wide open. It spans centuries, with the camera panning across deserts and rooftops, gaudy casino floors and sprawling constellations. Its characters \u2014 deities or otherwise \u2014 wink and beguile, snark and swallow people whole. The result is a treat to watch. But man, it can also be a really confusing ride. It\u2019s been 16 years since Neil Gaiman published American Gods, a novel pitting the gods of yore like Odin and Anubis against emerging ones like Technology and Media.",
        "This New Year\u2019s Eve, it is almost inevitable that you will hear (and possibly try to sing) \u201dAuld Lang Syne,\u201d a song whose melody is synonymous with the new year (and the theme of change more broadly) in the world, despite nearly incomprehensible syntax and vocabulary. The problem is that the text on which the song is based isn\u2019t in English at all \u2014 it\u2019s Scots, a similar but distinct language responsible for lyrics in the song such as \u201dWe twa hae run about the braes and pou\u2019d the gowans fine\u201d that are utterly incomprehensible to Americans.",
        "Five or six times a day, every day, for 48 years, chronobiologist Robert Sothern has counted off 60 seconds in his head and then compared the results against a clock. As part of a lifelong experiment on circadian rhythms, Sothern, now 69, is trying to confirm or reject a widely held belief: Many people feel that time flies by more quickly as they age. So far, Sothern\u2019s results are inconclusive. It\u2019s true that lately, according to his measurements \u2014 and his gut \u2014 time seems to be speeding up as he nears his 70s.",
        "Having spent months badly underestimating Donald Trump and the level of havoc he could wreak on the GOP nominating process, pundits are now swinging too far in the other direction \u2014 overstating the significance of the havoc, underrating the fundamentally solid position of the Republican Party, and drawing excessively broad conclusions about the ideological shape of the new more diverse America whose emergence is fueling Trumpism.",
        "The federal government is blocking the sale of hoverboards in the US until the scooters can be proven to meet newly created safety standards. Anyone who \u201dimports, manufactures, delivers, or sells\u201d hoverboards that don\u2019t meet the new standards could be sued or charged with a crime, according to a letter the US Consumer Product Safety Commission sent to the hoverboard industry Thursday. The letter will probably lead to recalls of hoverboards that have already been sold as well.",
        "The US Department of Justice has made it impossible to ignore the truth: In communities across America, police and the communities they serve simply don\u2019t trust each other anymore. The official investigation into the Baltimore Police Department after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody is just the latest illustration. It shows a police department built on the assumption that criminals were \u201dblack males\u201d and that black men were criminals. Meanwhile, the homicide rates in many US cities jumped sharply last year: an average increase of nearly 15 percent among 25 of the nation\u2019s 30 biggest cities.",
        "It\u2019s the holiday season, which means you\u2019ve probably headed out of town. Or perhaps you\u2019re prepping for an upcoming trip, or contemplating when and where you might take your next one. If so, Cuba might come to mind: One year after President Barack Obama announced he had begun the process of normalizing relations after half a century of official hostility, travel to the island nation has become easier than ever. Americans are still technically forbidden from traveling to Cuba as tourists \u2014 it would take an act of Congress to formally lift the ban.",
        "Jeb Bush has virtually no chance of winning the Iowa caucuses \u2014 but his team wants to make sure Marco Rubio doesn\u2019t do too well there either. On Tuesday, the Super PAC Right to Rise USA released a new negative ad attacking Rubio \u2014 and, according to the Des Moines Register\u2019s Jennifer Jacobs, the ad will air on Iowa television. The ad itself is a pretty misleading attack on Rubio for missing a Senate briefing on terrorism to fundraise (Rubio actually attended a similar briefing days earlier, one that included classified information).",
        "Pennsylvania prosecutors announced on Wednesday that they have charged Bill Cosby for an alleged sexual assault that took place in 2004. Later in the day, a judge set his bail at $1 million, which Cosby immediately paid to avoid spending time in jail. The charge follows more than a year of mounting allegations against Cosby, which began after comedian Hannibal Buress put a spotlight on the issue. Nearly 60 women have publicly accused Cosby of sexual misconduct over the past four decades, typically alleging that the comedian drugged and assaulted them.",
        "It\u2019s hard to name the best thing about Aretha Franklin\u2019s performance at the 2015 Kennedy Center Honors, because I had goose bumps from the second she walked onstage in a fur coat to the moment when she raised her arms in triumph after letting go of the final note. The Kennedy Center Honors, which recognize \u201dthe extraordinary and unparalleled talents of individuals whose impact and genius have left an indelible mark on civilization,\u201d were held December 6, but the ceremony didn\u2019t air on CBS until December 29.",
        "There\u2019s recently been some buzz that Chris Christie, whose presidential campaign has long been considered an afterthought, could be on the rise in New Hampshire. After all, he\u2019s been campaigning hard in the state, won some big endorsements, and has gotten a in polls there. But now, Donald Trump wants to remind everyone why Christie fell out of contention in the first place: the Bridgegate scandal. \u201dChris can\u2019t win because of his past,\u201d Trump said in a Monday interview with WMUR. \u201dThere\u2019s no way that he didn\u2019t know about the closure of the George Washington Bridge.",
        "The Obama administration has quieted down its immigration enforcement over the past couple of years. But the administration is starting 2016 with a bang: with a nationwide wave of immigration raids. In late December, the Washington Post broke the news that the administration was finalizing a plan to find and deport Central American families who came to the US in the past couple of years but have been ordered to leave by a judge. The government didn\u2019t waste much time. Raids started in the Atlanta area on the morning of Saturday, January 2.",
        "When #BoycottStarWarsVII began trending on Twitter in October, Lord Humungus (@DarklyEnlighten, before the account was suspended) was smiling in some deep pocket of the internet. Humungus created #BoycottStarWarsVII to bemoan the number of nonwhite actors with roles in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the latest installment of the franchise. People had every right to be upset over this racist hashtag, especially when it began trending. But it wasn\u2019t really what Humungus said or did that caused #BoycottStarWarsVII to start trending; instead, everyone who voiced their disagreement with him by loudly repeating and retweeting his argument was to blame.",
        "\u2019Tis the season to reflect on the year that was. So to celebrate, I took a look at the most wildly health claims of 2015. A few of the highlights: 1) Gwyneth Paltrow told women to steam clean their vaginas. Don\u2019t do this. Gwyneth Paltrow, a leading proponent of a diet. (Donato Images) In January, Gwyneth Paltrow \u2014 who has a long history of spouting absurd health claims \u2014 stooped to a new low, endorsing steam cleaning one\u2019s vagina to boost energy and rebalance female hormones. An excerpt: The real golden ticket here is the Mugwort .",
        "A lot has been made in the media of Ted Cruz\u2019s demeanor: Pugnacious and harsh, he garners condemnation from fellow senators, Republican and Democrat alike. But as I wrote in a previous story, Cruz\u2019s personality \u2014 however distasteful he may come off to some voters \u2014 probably won\u2019t be a major determinant of his chances at the presidency. Unspoken in this reality, though, is that Cruz is at least somewhat insulated from criticism because of his gender.",
        "When 2015 began, few would have expected that a \u201ddemocratic socialist\u201d could seriously compete on fundraising with Hillary Clinton, the choice of the Democratic Party establishment. But that\u2019s just what Bernie Sanders has managed to do. The Vermont senator\u2019s campaign announced on Saturday that he had raised $33. 2 million in the most recent fundraising period \u2014 and $73 million for his campaign overall. This is a huge sum that ensures that his campaign won\u2019t lack for cash as the first caucuses and primaries near.",
        "It\u2019s a new year, and Game of Thrones season six is only a few months away, but as author George R. R. Martin confirmed Saturday morning, there will not be a new Game of Thrones book anytime soon. The Winds of Winter, the sixth novel in Martin\u2019s A Song of Ice and Fire series, has been highly anticipated for years, especially now that the HBO series has grown so popular.",
        "The entertainment industry isn\u2019t exactly known for realistic portrayals of abortion. It\u2019s a common trope that women facing unintended pregnancies onscreen either don\u2019t consider abortion as an option, or have the choice made for them by a convenient miscarriage. When women do have abortions onscreen, their risk of death is comically exaggerated. And aside from a recent episode of Scandal, it\u2019s almost unheard of to see a realistic depiction of the procedure itself. Abortion plot lines on American television aren\u2019t quite as rare as you might think, according to a new report, at least in the last decade."
