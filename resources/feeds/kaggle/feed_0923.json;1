        "Originally published on Ensia. Volkswagen\u2019s deceptive engine controls, uncovered a few months ago, gave its cars a dual personality: one for everyday operation and a secret greener one used to rank higher than warranted on vehicle emissions tests. Regulators in the US and Europe are now examining whether some television manufacturers similarly misbehaved, programming their screens to detect a standard video test clip, dial down their brightness, and thus cheat on energy consumption tests.",
        "Ted Cruz would represent a lot of firsts should he be elected president: He\u2019d be the first Hispanic president, and the first president to be born in Canada (or anywhere outside the 50 states, for that matter). But he\u2019d also be the first president ever to have clerked for the Supreme Court. And Cruz has cited his subsequent record before the court, where he has presented oral arguments nine times (eight as solicitor general of Texas) as an important credential both in this presidential campaign and in his 2012 run for Senate.",
        "A militia protesting the \u201dtyranny\u201d of the federal government seized the headquarters of a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon on January 2 and, in a video posted to Facebook, called on \u201dpatriots\u201d from all over the country to come to the refuge with their guns to join their fight. On January 26, six members of that militia, including leaders Ammon and Ryan Bundy, were arrested on charges of conspiracy to impede federal law enforcement officers from their official duties. The arrests happened after a shootout in which one militia member was killed, and another injured.",
        "A friend who used to enjoy Sherlock but now finds it tiresome once said to me that the mystery show\u2019s third season, which aired in 2014, was the series disappearing up its own ass. Rating 1. 5 If that were true (and I think it was) then the New Year\u2019s special that kicked off the year 2016 was the show making its way through the intestines, then setting up shop in its own stomach while preparing a ladder to climb up through its esophagus.",
        "On Sunday night, the Earth will pass through a field of debris left behind by an extinct comet. That debris \u2014 bits of rock and dust \u2014 will ignite when it enters our atmosphere, streaking across the night sky. This event is called the Quadrantid meteor shower, and it will be the first great celestial show of 2016. With a peak of just a few hours, it will also be the briefest meteor shower of the year (most meteor showers peak over a couple of days). But it\u2019s perhaps the most dazzling.",
        "Over the holiday weekend, a group of predominantly white militiamen took up guns and began occupying the government\u2019s Malheur National Wildlife Refuge headquarters in Oregon, culminating in a tense standoff with law enforcement in the area. It\u2019s a big story. This is an armed militia using the threat of violence to get the federal government to change the law \u2014 specifically, the gunmen want the feds to give up publicly managed land to local ranchers, loggers, and miners.",
        "It\u2019s been a rough decade or so for Microsoft. It\u2019s lost its position as the most valuable tech company in the world to its old rival Apple, and even though Windows retains a huge market share in PCs, that market is collapsing, and Microsoft has struggled to keep up with Apple and Google when it comes to tablets, phones, and watches.",
        "According to new research, giving birth can be as traumatic to a woman\u2019s body as hardcore sports like running a marathon \u2014 but doctors often don\u2019t treat it that way. \u201dChildbirth is arguably one of the most dramatic musculoskeletal events the human body undergoes,\u201d write the authors of a new University of Michigan study evaluating maternal recovery from labor and delivery. And it turns out that women can get very similar injuries from childbirth as the ones serious athletes get. A quarter of women in the study had stress fractures similar to the kinds athletes often suffer.",
        "One of the really great things about Shakespeare fandom is that you have a limited number of things to work with.",
        "After mass shootings, President Barack Obama has urged the American people to call on Congress to pass measures that would restrict access to guns and, hopefully, reduce gun violence. But after multiple pleas, Congress hasn\u2019t acted, even after the grisly mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012. So Obama is now acting on his own \u2014 with executive actions. \u201dEvery single year, more than 30, 000 Americans have their lives cut short by guns,\u201d Obama said at a press conference on Tuesday.",
        "Only a few days into the new year, the Middle East has already taken a significant turn for the worse. The region\u2019s greatest rivalry, between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has become rapidly and significantly more toxic in the past few days, and it could have repercussions across the Middle East. On Saturday, protesters in Tehran attacked the Saudi embassy, ransacking and burning it as Iran ignored or refused Saudi requests to protect the building.",
        "It\u2019s hard to walk away from Netflix\u2019s Making a Murderer without a big sense of outrage. The show depicts the story of a local police department allegedly pursuing a personal vendetta from 2003 to 2007, eventually landing a man and his nephew in prison for life for a murder they, the show suggests, didn\u2019t commit. According to the documentary, the Manitowoc County Sheriff\u2019s Department in Wisconsin did this because the man, Steven Avery, sued county officials after he was cleared for a previous crime that wrongly put him in prison for 18 years \u2014 from 1985 to 2003.",
        "The car wars are heating up. A few weeks after we learned that Ford and Google are creating a joint venture to develop cars, General Motors and Lyft have announced a joint venture of their own. Lyft is raising $500 million in investment capital from GM along with another $500 million from other investors. Those other investors include two Chinese companies that are huge in Asia, albeit obscure in the United States \u2014 Alibaba in and Didi Kuaidi in .",
        "The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has announced that four new elements \u2014 with atomic numbers of 113, 115, 117, and 118 \u2014 will be added to the periodic table. This is a big deal, since these four elements \u2014 all super heavy, and very radioactive \u2014 complete the unfilled spaces on the seventh row of the periodic table. Their discoveries also open the door for scientists to create even heavier, perhaps useful, synthetic elements in the future.",
        "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to punt the nomination of Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s replacement until after the next president takes office, hoping a Republican will be in the White House by then. But there\u2019s one complicating factor for McConnell: He himself might not still run the Senate. Democrats could very likely retake the Senate next fall, regardless of who wins the presidency. Democrats only need a net gain of either four or five seats depending on who wins the presidency. (Vice presidents are tiebreakers in a Senate.) And this year\u2019s map looks hugely favorable for Democrats.",
        "Donald Trump has managed to lead the Republican presidential race for months without running a single television ad. Now, with a few weeks left before the Iowa caucuses (where Trump is polling slightly behind Sen. Ted Cruz) he\u2019s finally taking to the airwaves \u2014 spending $2 million a week on TV ads in Iowa and New Hampshire. And this is his first ad: The ad\u2019s script, as transcribed by CBS News: TRUMP: I\u2019m Donald Trump and I approve this message. ANNOUNCER: The politicians can pretend it\u2019s something else, but Donald Trump calls it radical Islamic terrorism.",
        "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote an absolutely beautiful response to a commenter on his page that encourages girls to be the heroes of their own stories and do amazing things in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math): Zuckerberg had posted about his \u201dpersonal challenge\u201d for 2016 \u2014 a modest goal of trying to build himself a home artificial intelligence system like Jarvis in Iron Man to help him with household and work tasks. You know, as you do.",
        "A lot of ink and pixels were spilled in 2012 wondering why billionaires hated Barack Obama so much when his administration had presided over emergency measures that prevented a banking crisis and laid the groundwork for a robust stock market recovery. Well, now the IRS has released data on how much various people actually paid in taxes in 2013, and we can see the answer. Very rich people really, really wanted Obama to lose in 2012 because his reelection led to them paying drastically higher effective tax rates.",
        "Robert Sothern is the ultimate quantified man. For 48 years, five or six times each day, he\u2019s been tracking his bodily functions and mental acuity in extensive \u2014 almost absurd \u2014 detail. \u201dI measure my heart rate for a minute,\u201d he tells me on a recent phone call. \u201dI measure blood pressure. I measure respiration for two minutes, breathing slowly and counting how many times I inhale.",
        "Hating Congress is an American national pastime, and that\u2019s not likely to change anytime soon. But look back on the year in legislating, and one thing becomes clear \u2014 a lot of legislating happened in 2015. It was a year, in other words, when Congress actually started working again and passing bills. Not just bills to keep the government\u2019s lights on or bills to rename post offices (though we had those, of course) but major substantive bills that addressed big questions of national policy.",
        "A person could easily spend $4 on a pint of fancy ice cream or a tiny filet of salmon at their local grocery store. But Leanne Brown set out to make a cookbook for Americans with a food budget of $4 per day. Brown\u2019s Good and Cheap, currently the focus of a wildly successful Kickstarter campaign, aims to make good food more accessible to Americans on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, often called food stamps). Though Brown has crafted a pretty cookbook, the question is how practical this approach is.",
        "The thirst for everything Star Wars in unquenchable. The new movie, Episode VII \u2014 The Force Awakens, is huge; it\u2019s set to pass Avatar this week in North American earnings and has taken in $1. 5 billion worldwide. It\u2019s also reinvigorated fans\u2019 love for the movies (well, three of them, anyway) that came before it. With that in mind, there\u2019s no better time to revisit IA4 Studio\u2019s \u201dSpeedrun: Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\u201d a animated recap of the original film.",
        "A federal building in Oregon is under armed occupation, the Middle East\u2019s 2 regional superpowers are getting hostile, and, oh yeah, the biggest actions of the Obama presidency. Welcome back! Vox Sentences is written by Dylan Matthews and Dara Lind. TOP NEWS There can be only one regional hegemon Atta The most powerful Sunni country in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, and the most powerful Shia country, Iran, are at odds following the former\u2019s execution of 47 people over the weekend. [Vox Max Fisher] Those killed included the highly prominent Shia cleric Nimr .",
        "Harvey W. Wiley was an intellectual who taught Greek, Latin, and chemistry. So naturally, he assembled a group of young men to eat poison. As the above video shows, it had amazing results. In 1882, Wiley became chief of the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s Chemical Division, and he quickly became an advocate for food standardization and regulation in a country that lacked both. Along with activists like Alice Lakey, he led a movement to make food safer.",
        "On Tuesday, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder declared a state of emergency over a lead crisis in Flint, Michigan, where 4 percent of children have elevated levels of lead in their bloodstream \u2014 twice what the rate was just years ago. As Vox\u2019s Libby Nelson explained, the root of the crisis is budget problems: Faced with financial constraints, officials made cuts that effectively allowed the city\u2019s water to get contaminated with more lead. But an overlooked aspect of the crisis is how it represents a common thread in lead exposure issues: Lead often hits black communities hardest.",
        "Silicon Valley philosopher king Paul Graham\u2019s essay on inequality has set tech Twitter on fire for the past few days. It\u2019s about as intensely loved and hated as any piece on the topic I can remember. Which makes sense, because it manages to jam some very good points together with some very bad ones. Graham, a famed adviser to technology startups, appears to have experienced the inequality conversation as an attack on his life\u2019s work. His essay is thus more a defense of startups and their worth than it is an analysis of the trends driving inequality.",
        "Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz has a fraught relationship with some members of her party, especially progressives and activists. A new interview with the New York Times Magazine isn\u2019t likely to help that: Wasserman Schultz said that she sees \u201da complacency among the generation of young women whose entire lives have been lived after Roe v. Wade was decided.\u201d Ana Marie Cox asked Wasserman Schultz about whether she sees a \u201dgenerational divide\u201d between younger women and women of her age in terms of their enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton.",
        "A mogul from Utah has created either one blatantly racist dating site or one extremely calculated attempt to rile our collective outrage. Sam Russell is the mastermind behind Where White People Meet, a dating site whose title explains its purpose. Though anyone can join Russell\u2019s site, its exclusionary title and apparent focus has irked many people on the internet. But Russell doesn\u2019t believe he\u2019s being racist. \u201dThe last thing in the world I am is racist. I dated a black woman once,\u201d Russell told the Washington Post.",
        "As leaked audio of Donald Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women continued to dominate news coverage and drive prominent Republicans to abandon their presidential nominee leading into Sunday night\u2019s debate, Trump was singularly focused on another sexual assault allegation: Juanita Broaddrick\u2019s claim that Bill Clinton raped her while campaigning for Arkansas governor in 1978. First, Trump retweeted Broaddrick, a strong supporter of his, arguing that Clinton\u2019s actions (and, she claims, Hillary Clinton\u2019s efforts to enable them) outweigh any of Trump\u2019s mere comments: How many times must it be said? Actions speak louder than words. DT said bad things!",
        "The Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld Library at the United Nations \u2014 named after the secretary general who died in 1961 \u2014 doesn\u2019t make the news very often. Meant to be used by the professional Secretariat staff of the UN and by national delegations, it stores documents and publications from the UN and related organizations, as well as a raft of other books and materials on international relations, law, economics, and other topics. So, you know, a library."
