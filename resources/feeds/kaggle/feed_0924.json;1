        "A 5. \u201dseismic event\u201d was reported near North Korea\u2019s nuclear testing site late Tuesday evening. North Korea\u2019s government is claiming the event was a hydrogen bomb test. Hydrogen bombs are a more powerful type of nuclear weapon than the North has previously tested, one that North Korea first claimed to have developed in December. There is a real chance that this is a nuclear test: South Korean, Japanese, and Chinese authorities have said they believe the earthquake is manmade, and it is the same magnitude as a 2013 North Korean underground nuclear test.",
        "Twitter users have long complained that the service\u2019s promise of 140 characters per message is not exactly true. If a user includes a link or an image in a tweet, it can shave up to 23 characters off the total. Include both an image and a link and there are less than 100 characters left to work with. And who can possibly express themselves in 100 characters?! (Ahem.) Now, it seems, Twitter is finally set to remove this longstanding aggravation.",
        "After hearing a trickle of reports about food poisoning over recent months, millions of Americans are probably wondering: Is it safe to eat at Chipotle? The bad news is that public health investigators haven\u2019t identified the source of the E. coli that sickened almost 60 Chipotle customers in 11 states. By the time they started testing the restaurants and the employees, they couldn\u2019t find a trace of the bacteria. Related Chipotle\u2019s food safety crisis, explained But that may be a blessing in disguise, because without a specific ingredient or supplier to blame, Chipotle has to inspect everything.",
        "There seems to be a big source of confusion coming out of President Barack Obama\u2019s executive actions on guns: Is Obama really closing the infamous \u201dgun show loophole\u201d? The short version: No. The long version: For one, the \u201dgun show loophole\u201d is a terrible name. The better way to look at it is a private sales loophole: If someone purchases a gun from a private seller, such as a collector, friend, or family member, no gun background check is required. This is as the \u201dgun show loophole\u201d because these types of private sellers can be found at gun shows.",
        "Americans are hooked on apps. Your father or grandmother might buy programs like Lumosity in the hopes that its appealing marketing claims will be realized: Just a few minutes of puzzle solving each day will make you smarter, boost your memory, and stave off conditions like dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s. Altogether, consumers now spend $1 billion every year on brain games. The problem with these programs: They\u2019re a load of hooey. For years, researchers have looked into brain games and found that they simply don\u2019t have the benefits they purport to. Now the federal government\u2019s starting to crack down.",
        "The recent criminal charges against Bill Cosby are sparking a debate over the statute of limitations for rape and sexual assault. Some argue that imposing a deadline on when charges can be filed hurts victims and impedes justice, while others say statutes of limitations are a necessary protection for the rights of the accused. Either way, one thing is clear: Where you live makes a huge difference in when, and whether, you can seek justice for an old case of sexual assault.",
        "Sen. Ted Cruz, who is currently leading in the polls for the Republican Iowa caucuses, was born in Canada (Calgary, to be exact). Donald Trump, who is currently second in the polls for the Republican Iowa caucuses, claims to be very concerned about this. He\u2019s fretting that nominating Cruz would mire the GOP in a \u201dprecarious\u201d court battle over whether Cruz is actually eligible to serve as president \u2014 because the Constitution restricts the presidency to \u201d citizens\u201d of the United States. In the past, Trump has said that Cruz isn\u2019t a citizen. He\u2019s not saying that explicitly anymore.",
        "If I were to decree from on high a single New Year\u2019s resolution for everyone I possibly could, it would be to improve your cooking game in 2017. For a lot of you, that might mean to start cooking, period. For many (like me too often) it might mean to stop eating out so much and get back in the kitchen. For still others, it might mean finally tackling that challenging recipe you\u2019ve always meant to try but have never had the motivation or nerve. Let me explain why cooking for yourself is so important. Why should you cook?",

        "Every time North Korea has tested an atomic weapon underground, the explosion has released a wave of seismic energy that moves through the ground like sound moves through the air. That\u2019s why seismic monitoring stations across the globe can essentially hear the explosions and record them in precise detail. In the video below, Zhigang Peng, a geophysicist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, has converted seismic data from each of North Korea\u2019s four nuclear tests \u2014 including the one that occurred Tuesday \u2014 into audio.",
        "Why do we allow safety improvements and policies for cars, toys, and medications, but we don\u2019t seem to apply the same standard to guns? That was President Barack Obama\u2019s big question at the start of his CNN town hall in support of his new executive actions on firearms. \u201dThere\u2019s nothing else in our lives that we purchase where we don\u2019t try to make it a little safer if we can,\u201d Obama said. \u201dTraffic fatalities have gone down drastically during my lifetime.

        "A brokered convention is a favorite subject of media speculation. Every four years, the chatter begins in earnest over the winter: Will this be the year that party elites, through backroom deals, end up picking their own, favored candidate? This year, the chatter began after the Washington Post reported in December that Republican Party elites held a secret dinner meeting to discuss what would happen if Donald Trump arrived at the convention with a significant number of delegates. Brokered conventions make for good headlines.",
        "This week, the Canadian company behind the Keystone XL pipeline made a move that activated progressives\u2019 worst fears about major trade agreements.

        "Amazingly enough, \u201dbirther\u201d questions about Ted Cruz\u2019s qualifications for the presidency have suddenly become mainstream in the GOP. On Wednesday, two leading Republicans \u2014 including John McCain, the party\u2019s 2008 presidential nominee \u2014 questioned whether Cruz\u2019s Canadian birthplace makes him ineligible for the nation\u2019s highest office. \u201dThere is a question,\u201d McCain said in an interview with the Steve Merrill Show (via Andrew Kacyznski of BuzzFeed News) about whether Cruz\u2019s birth \u201don foreign soil\u201d disqualifies him. \u201dI am not a constitutional scholar on that,\u201d McCain continued. \u201dBut I think it\u2019s worth looking into!",
        "One of the biggest debates in drug policy is whether legalizing drugs, and therefore increasing access to them, would actually lead to more use and abuse \u2014 or whether people would be rational enough to stay away from dangerous drugs. Supporters of legalizing all drugs tend to believe the latter, while opponents of legalization tend to believe the former. In comes the opioid painkiller and heroin epidemic.",
        "A lot of what we know about how the government works \u2014 what motivates politicians, how exactly the three branches of government respond to one another \u2014 is thanks to the work of political scientists, who have been studying public officials for decades. Much of their research, which involves interviews, surveys, and field experiments with politicians, is made possible by a special exemption in federal law that allows academics to study public figures without burdensome ethics restraints that govern all other research conducted on humans. But the federal government is looking to quietly remove that exemption.",

If you know about the travails of bees, but you\u2019re a normal person who doesn\u2019t follow this stuff obsessively, you are probably thinking one of two things: Wait, haven\u2019t we known for years that neonics are killing bees?

        "On Tuesday, President Barack Obama teared up as he announced executive actions on guns and described some of the gun violence that has killed children around the US. \u201dEvery time I think about those kids, it gets me mad,\u201d Obama said as he wiped tears. \u201dIt happens on the streets of Chicago every day.\u201d Then Fox News decided to mock him for it. \u201dI would check that podium for, like, a raw onion,\u201d host Andrea Tantaros said. \u201dIt\u2019s not really believable.\u201d But The Daily Show\u2019s Trevor Noah was not having it. \u201dAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d he said.",

        "President Barack Obama has never proposed gun confiscation during his time in office. Yet whenever Obama comes up with a new proposal, like his executive actions this week, gun sales spike, in part due to fears that the president is about to take away people\u2019s guns.

        "We think we know how TV cancellations work. A network realizes that a show\u2019s ratings aren\u2019t where they should be, and it pulls the plug.

And in very rare cases, a show runs for multiple seasons but is canceled before its cast and crew are ready for it to end. Historically, the vast majority of TV shows have been canceled at or before the end of their second seasons.",
