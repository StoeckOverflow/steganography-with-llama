        "The US economy created new jobs at an unexpectedly strong pace in December. There was a net increase of 292, 000 jobs in the month, according to figures released today by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists were expecting the economy to add about 200, 000, in line with the average pace during 2015. Even better, BLS says that last month\u2019s jobs report had undercounted the number of jobs created in October and November by a total of 50, 000. That means the economy was creating jobs at an unexpectedly strong pace throughout the last quarter of 2015.",

        "When the NFL announced that Super Bowl 50 will feature Coldplay as its halftime performer, the immediate question was whether the band could enlist a famous friend to join them. The answer, as we learned yesterday \u2014 and predicted when the Coldplay news first came out \u2014 is yes, and it\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9. Well, and Bruno Mars, per Entertainment Tonight. But hey, let\u2019s talk about Beyonc\u00e9. Coldplay frontman Chris Martin has been friends with Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z for years, through his and America\u2019s Coolest Mom, Gwyneth Paltrow.",
        "More than any political candidate in memory, Donald Trump\u2019s value proposition to voters is simple and crystal clear: He\u2019s a winner. Everything else follows from that. He doesn\u2019t owe wealthy political donors or political elites anything. He\u2019ll get the best trade deals and kick the most terrorist ass. He\u2019ll defy political correctness and tell it like it is. ISIS will give us its oil. Mexico will pay for our wall. Corporations will beg us to relocate their factories to the US. Why? Because Trump is a winner.",

        "Inequality is perhaps my favorite interview topic in Silicon Valley: It\u2019s fascinating to watch ordinarily confident titans of industry squirm in their seats before offering a conspicuously measured response. But occasionally a leader in the community breaks an unspoken rule by being brutally honest in public. The tech world encountered one of these deliciously informative moments earlier this week, when a startup investor and mentor, Paul Graham, admitted that he was personally (and unabashedly) responsible for rising inequality.",
        "The global war on drugs is killing Mexico: A new study found that violence from the drug war caused Mexico\u2019s life expectancy to stagnate \u2014 and, in men\u2019s cases, drop \u2014 after six decades of increases. The study, published in Health Affairs, found that male life expectancy in Mexico fell by about seven months between 2000 and 2010, as the nation\u2019s homicide rate rose from about 9. 5 per 100, 000 people to 22 per 100, 000 people.

        "December\u2019s job growth numbers are in, and they make it official: 2015 was the year for job growth since the 1990s, and only slightly behind the big gains of 2014. Unemployment fell in 2015 from an already low 5. 6 percent at the end of 2014 to 5 percent in December 2015. Wages grew 2. 5 percent during 2015, which isn\u2019t a huge number but looks more impressive when you remember that inflation was close to zero for the year. So what accounts for the second straight year of strong economic results?",

        "It\u2019s the first weekend of a brand new year, which means it\u2019s time to put that resolution to finally get in shape to the test. And for our money, there\u2019s no better workout inspiration than a Big Moment from a great sports movie \u2014 or, more specifically, the music that accompanies it. After all, a cinematic sports feat wouldn\u2019t have nearly the same dramatic impact without the perfect tune to underscore the triumph. Look at Rocky, for example.",
        "Celebrities love eliminating very specific foods from their diet and then claiming they\u2019ve figured out the holy grail of health \u2014 despite limited scientific backing. Now it seems athletes do it too. According to his personal chef, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady eats a highly restrictive, diet that centers on what he deems \u201d \u201d foods.

That\u2019s the biggest jackpot in history, even when adjusted for inflation. Lottery jackpots have grown in recent years, with all 10 of the biggest nominal hauls coming since 2012 and inflation adjustments making little difference to the overall rankings. But by design these jackpots are small in comparison to the amount of cash Americans spend on lottery tickets. Total spending on lotteries amounted to a shocking $70 billion in 2014, which amounts to about $300 per adult.",

They all have their own motivations. For Democrats like Pelosi and Earnest, it\u2019s a chance for revenge after years of birtherism targeting Barack Obama.",
        "If you want to start a controversy in education, just say two words: sex ed. What students learn about pregnancy prevention, sexually transmitted diseases, and human sexuality is one of the most hotly contested debates in education. The result is sex education that\u2019s patchy at best and just plain wrong at worst. Most high schools don\u2019t teach students the 16 topics the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend will set them up for healthy sexual behavior.",
        "The Golden Globes \u2014 the trendy, tipsy cousin of more \u201dprestigious\u201d awards shows like the Oscars and the Emmys \u2014 has been handing out shiny trophies to movies and television series for the past 74 years. It\u2019s one of the more unpredictable ceremonies to grace awards season, thanks to its tendency to honor even slightly less traditional works than the Oscars or the Emmys, as well as its open bar. But when Golden Globe winners thank the Hollywood Foreign Press Association in their acceptance speeches, who, exactly, are they talking about? And why?",

        "The 73rd Annual Golden Globe Awards were . .. something. For one thing, Ricky Gervais hosted for the fourth time. The comedian upheld the reputation he earned during his three consecutive hosting stints in 2010, 2011, and 2012, when the pointed barbs he aimed at his celebrity audience helped define him as one of the most shameless awards show emcees in recent memory. He was, to be frank, not very good.",
        "The poorly kept secret of the Golden Globes is that they can be bought. Voted on by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the awards are famous for the lengths to which studios will go to woo the group\u2019s membership \u2014 which usually numbers around 90. The most famous incident involved young actress Pia Zadora, who won an award in 1982 amid accusations that her husband had paid for it with an elaborate promotional campaign.

        "Lip readers, get to work. The biggest mystery of the 2016 Golden Globes is what Ricky Gervais said to Mel Gibson. During the show, there was an awkward moment between Gervais and Gibson during the introduction to a Mad Max clip. Gervais mentioned that he\u2019d said some unsavory things about Gibson in the past, which helped him earn the reputation for being a loose cannon and, well, a sexy pick to host the Golden Globes. Then Gibson came onstage and unleashed a joke that sounded like Gibson had been sitting on it for years.",

If you\u2019re someone who\u2019s followed his career over the years \u2014 especially the terrible dry spells he went through in the 1990s and 2000s \u2014 that must seem incredibly strange. But if you\u2019ve seen Creed, the Rocky spinoff where he\u2019s mesmerizing as boxing champ Rocky Balboa, it\u2019s much more understandable that he won the prize for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture.",
        "The 2016 Golden Globes got off to a rocky start. Ricky Gervais\u2019s monologue fell flat, and the Channing Hill chaser sucked the air out of the room. We thought we\u2019d be in for a long night (and I understand this may still be a possibility). Then, like a breath of fresh air, America Ferrera and Eva Longoria walked into our lives and briefly saved us. \u201dHi, I\u2019m Eva Longoria, not Eva Mendes,\u201d Longoria said. \u201dI\u2019m America Ferrera, not Gina Rodriguez,\u201d Ferrera said.

        "Kelly Sue DeConnick and Valentine De Landro\u2019s Bitch Planet isn\u2019t known for its subtleties. Rating 4. 5 That\u2019s not to say the comic is devoid of nuance or quiet moments; in fact, there are plenty. But I\u2019ve always seen Bitch Planet as more of a call to arms, a sledgehammer to the face of the society it reflects. In telling the story of a distant future where the patriarchy has gone unchecked and become omnipotent, and nonconforming women are sent to the hellish, galactic prison in the title, Bitch Planet destroys any notion that society treats women fairly.",

Not long after arriving, Bowman was invited to meet with Cosby at his home \u2014 seemingly a major break. Cosby offered her a glass of wine. But after drinking it, she later said, she blacked out.
