        "In it was not hard to find a story about a company cutting workers\u2019 hours in order to dodge Obamacare\u2019s insurance mandate. Target, Home Depot, and Walmart all ended up in the headlines for trying to dodge the employer mandate by having employees work fewer than 30 hours a week. Related Here\u2019s how much Obamacare has cut the uninsured rate in every state Those were real stories, and they affected real people with real jobs.",
        "Speaking in Iowa today, Hillary Clinton offered a proposal for a kind of supercharged Buffett Rule that would ensure very individuals would pay higher tax rates regardless of the source of their income. The idea is what her campaign is calling a \u201dFair Share Surcharge\u201d of 4 percent on incomes above $5 million per year. It\u2019s characterized as a surcharge rather than a 4 percentage point increase in the top marginal tax rate because the intention is to levy the fee on all income above the $5 million line regardless of the source of the income.",
        "On October 23, Southern California Gas Company discovered a leak at its Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility. It is still leaking, spewing methane into the atmosphere, sickening nearby residents, and prompting Gov. Jerry Brown to declare a state of emergency. It is widely being hailed as the worst environmental disaster since the BP oil spill. And SoCal Gas says the leak likely won\u2019t be contained until March at the earliest.",
        "When I entered journalism there were three places I badly wanted to work: The American Prospect, the Washington Monthly, and the New Republic. The decision turned out to be easy: TNR never called me back. The Washington Monthly didn\u2019t have positions. But I got lucky: The Prospect took me on as a writing fellow, and it turned out to be a dream job. Ten years later, the Prospect, the Monthly, and TNR are all in crisis. The Prospect laid off much of its staff and is retrenching to its roots as a policy journal.",
        "Chapo Guzman, the Mexican drug lord and one of the most famous criminals in the world, was recaptured on Friday after months on the run. But not before he\u2019d done something he\u2019d never done before: given an interview to the press. The intrepid journalist who managed to track down El Chapo and get him to agree to an conversation? actor, occasional activist, and reportorial dilettante Sean Penn, of course. The resulting interview \u2014 published in Rolling Stone \u2014 isn\u2019t very good.",

TOP NEWS Why unions are worried about SCOTUS Mark Images The Supreme Court heard oral arguments today in a case about a California teachers\u2019 union that has a lot of progressives very nervous.

        "The cast of this Thursday\u2019s primetime Republican debate will be the smallest yet. Fox Business has announced that two mainstays of the primetime debate \u2014 Rand Paul and Carly Fiorina \u2014 have failed to meet the network\u2019s new tougher polling requirements for inclusion. What Fox changed this time around was that it limited the primetime debate to the top six candidates in either national, Iowa, or New Hampshire polls (rather than saying that candidates needed to get a certain amount of support in the polls).",
        "In an decision on Tuesday, the US Supreme Court issued a mostly procedural ruling against Florida\u2019s death penalty system, ultimately requiring that the state change how it issues death sentences. The majority opinion, written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, came down to procedure. Florida law requires that a jury merely recommend whether a death sentence should be applied in a capital case, with the judge making the final decision on the sentence.",
        "In July 2015, forces aligned with Syrian leader Bashar began laying siege to the Syrian town of Madaya, cutting it off from the outside world, including its access to food supplies. By early January, residents had been reduced to eating grass and insects. They had already eaten the city\u2019s stray cats and dogs. At least 23 people died from starvation. Late on Monday, that siege appears to have ended \u2014 for the moment \u2014 as the first humanitarian assistance trucks, permitted entry under an international agreement to help Madaya, rolled into the city.",
        "On January 11, staffers of the New Republic learned via a note to the staff and a post on Medium that their beleaguered owner Chris Hughes had decided to sell the publication. That announcement came a bit more than a year after a massive at the magazine, in which Hughes tried to replace top editors Franklin Foer and Leon Wieseltier with more digitally minded recruits, only to provoke mass resignations from senior staffers and an immense backlash from the magazine\u2019s extensive network of alumni.",
        "For the last two years, global oil prices have been in free fall, and no one seems to know when the bungee cord will catch. In June 2014 you had to plunk down $110 to purchase a barrel of Brent crude. By early 2015 that had dropped to $60. Today it costs just $33 to buy that barrel of oil \u2014 a level not seen since 2004. It\u2019s a breathtaking decline.",
        "Kentucky\u2019s new Republican governor, Matt Bevin, plans to dismantle his state\u2019s Obamacare marketplace, Kynect. On the surface, this looks like a Tea Party conservative governor taking a stand against the law he campaigned against in 2015. Except Bevin\u2019s actions don\u2019t really show that at all. The best data we have suggests that the decision of whether to run an Obamacare marketplace isn\u2019t especially consequential. Bevin\u2019s move to kill off the marketplace seems to be a mixture of politics and practicality.",
        "Paul Bartels gets a rush every time he discovers a new species of tardigrade, the phylum of microscopic animals best known for being both strangely cute and able to survive the vacuum of space. \u201dThe first paper I wrote describing a new species, there was a feeling \u2014 like I just gave birth to this new thing,\u201d he tells me on a phone call. The rush comes, in part, because tardigrades are the most fascinating animals known to science, able to survive in just about every environment imaginable.",
        "Much has been made of the rapid rise of renewable energy in the US, but the policy workhorse behind it does not get nearly enough attention or credit. I\u2019m talking about the renewable portfolio standard (RPS): state laws that mandate a certain minimum amount of renewable energy in the electricity mix, rising over time. Some 29 states and DC now have RPSs in place. These standards were mostly passed in the late 1990s and 2000s, when (not coincidentally) Democrats had more power in state governments. The RPS has a mixed reputation among economists.",
        "Last night, Sen. Bernie Sanders was asked at a presidential forum about sexual assault on campus. His response was that it should be a matter for the police: \u201dIt is a crime, and it has to be treated as a serious crime.\u201d Sanders was probably trying to signal that he takes concerns about sexual assault seriously. But it also shows that he doesn\u2019t understand why colleges are handling sexual assaults in the first place. Related How college sexual assault became impossible to ignore Colleges don\u2019t handle sexual assault cases because they\u2019re trying to avoid bad publicity.",
        "Tuesday evening, 10 US Navy sailors were taken into Iranian custody. They are currently being held on Farsi Island in the Persian Gulf, home to a small Iranian Revolutionary Guards base. Fox News reports that the sailors, on two small boats, were traveling between ports in Kuwait and Bahrain. US officials told the Associated Press that the ships experienced mechanical failures during their journey, which caused them to drift into Iranian territorial waters. According to official US statements and every independent media report, the sailors are not prisoners or hostages.",
        "The State of the Union\u2019s original focus is to explain, well, the state of the union. But presidents have also used the speech to highlight their policy agenda, particularly what they expect to do in the next year. This year, White House officials promised President Barack Obama will focus less on a \u201dlaundry list\u201d of plans and more on \u201dAmerica\u2019s potential\u201d and his successes in office. Nonetheless, there were clear policy ideas in Obama\u2019s speech. Here, we pull apart what Obama said, what his policy plans would do, and what issues he\u2019s trying to address.",
        "With Bernie Sanders now leading in both Iowa and New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton\u2019s been trying to blunt his economic populist appeal by showing that she, too, is serious about taxing rich people. First she proposed a new 4 percent surcharge on all income above $5 million (including capital gains and investment income) and now she\u2019s proposing a hike in the estate tax. Clinton would increase the maximum rate to 45 percent from the current maximum of 40, and decrease the lifetime exemption from estate and gift taxes to $3. 5 million from $5. 45 million.",
        "I noticed it as a child. If I close my right eye, the world just looks . .. colder. White walls take on a very subtle blue or green tint. If I close my left eye, the world becomes a bit warmer, as if filtered by very pale rose glass. The effect is extremely, extremely subtle. It\u2019s not like my eyes are covered with 3D glasses. It\u2019s as if someone pulled up a color slider in Photoshop and adjusted the hue in each eye by just one tiny notch.",
        "MSNBC asked Benjy Sarlin, its reporter on the Republican race, and Alex its reporter on the Democratic race, to flip jobs for a week and write up what they learned. Their conversation is worth reading in full, but something Sarlin wrote caught my eye: I was caught off guard by how specific and personal Democratic voters\u2019 issues tended to be. One woman told me she had lost a job because she had to take care of a sick relative and wanted paid family leave.",
        "It\u2019s a familiar dilemma for women: Should we highlight our gender or overcompensate for it? In 2008, when Hillary Clinton was running as the first candidate with a credible chance of becoming the first woman president in the nation\u2019s history, she staked her fortunes on the latter strategy. On the trail, she shunned questions about her gender and talked up her experience on issues like the economy and foreign policy. She rarely spoke of the historic aspect of her candidacy \u2014 until she lost. Her approach could not be more different this time around.",
        "BOONE, IOWA \u2014 People connected to the Democratic establishment still tend to view the Bernie Sanders campaign with bemusement, incomprehension, or scorn. They might get a call when the Iowa caucus results come in on February 1. A new set of polls indicates that the race in the state \u2014 which Hillary Clinton clearly led for all 2015 \u2014 is now extremely close. In fact, two of the four polls released so far this month actually put Sanders ahead \u2014 they\u2019re the first to show him up in months, and seem to suggest the momentum is on his side.",
        "The next primetime Republican presidential debate will be tonight at 9 pm Eastern. It will take place in North Charleston, South Carolina, and will air on the Fox Business Network. A live stream will be free and available to all at FoxBusiness. com. This time around, Fox chose to cut down on the number of candidates who will be permitted to attend. Just 7 of the remaining 12 met the network\u2019s more stringent polling qualifications for the primetime event. They are Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, and John Kasich.",
        "You probably remember Friends as one of the best comedies of its era, a megahit that nonetheless possessed warm, funny, relatable characters and a surprisingly soapy storytelling style. It spawned hairstyles, catchphrases, and Ross and Rachel, perhaps the definitive \u2019 relationship of the \u201990s. Friends turned 20 in 2014, and that meant the usual round of nostalgic roundups and think pieces about the show (including a couple that suggested it wasn\u2019t worth all the hype). Even more of these pieces followed when the show hit Netflix in early 2015.",
        "Democrats are optimistic about the future. They may have gotten pasted in 2014, but they expect great results in the next decade based on favorable trends in the population. \u201dThe Republican party is in a death spiral,\u201d Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg warns in his new book America Ascendant.",
        "Is Ted Cruz constitutionally eligible to serve as president of the United States? Very few people are willing to say he isn\u2019t, exactly. But there sure are a lot of questions being raised. Cruz, who was born in Canada to a US citizen mother and a noncitizen father, is definitely a US citizen. But is he a \u201d citizen,\u201d as the Constitution requires?",
        "Planned Parenthood is suing the people behind the Center for Medical Progress (CMP) the group that released a series of misleading videos this summer claiming that the women\u2019s health organization sells fetal tissue for profit. \u201dThe people behind this fraud lied and broke the law in order to spread malicious lies about Planned Parenthood,\u201d Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement.",
        "One of the more exotic explanations for America\u2019s incredible drop in crime is the lead theory. As the theory goes, we know that lead exposure is really harmful \u2014 it can cause learning disabilities, lower IQs, impulsivity, and aggressive behavior. So when America began taking lead out of its gasoline, it reduced all these bad outcomes \u2014 and crime, statistics show, fell right alongside rates of lead exposure.",
        "CLEAR LAKE, IOWA \u2014 As Donald Trump lingered for a few minutes to meet potential after a Saturday rally, one man in an American flag cap tried to push through the throng. \u201dDonald! Donald!\u201d he shouted. \u201dSign my sign!\u201d Shortly afterward, the man proudly displayed his newly autographed handiwork: \u201dTrump 2016: There Will Be Hell Toup\u00e9e.\u201d The rally at Clear Lake\u2019s Surf Ballroom \u2014 the site of Buddy Holly\u2019s last performance before his death in a 1959 plane crash \u2014 was a raucous, freewheeling affair that attracted a crowd of around 1, 700."
