        "Americans had every reason, when news broke that 10 US sailors had been \u201ddetained\u201d by Iran, to worry. This is a country that is a state sponsor of terror, that actively abetted the deaths of US soldiers in Iraq, and that, in 2007, held a group of British sailors for 13 days. So I am sympathetic to those who met this news with outrage or panic, particularly common among those who fear that Iran\u2019s steps toward reconciliation with the West are a ruse that in fact heightens their threat.",
        "When massive stars die, they do not fade gently into the good night. They collapse in on themselves and explode. It\u2019s called a supernova, and \u201dit is the largest explosion that takes place in space,\u201d as NASA explains. Today in Science, astronomers report they\u2019ve found the brightest such explosion ever observed. (To be more specific, it\u2019s the most luminous ever observed. Luminosity is the measure of how much light and energy an object emits.",
        "When allegations of sexual assault against Bill Cosby first came to light a decade ago, it barely caused a ripple in the public consciousness. When comedian Hannibal Buress called Cosby out as a rapist in 2014, people paid a lot more attention \u2014 but many still had a hard time believing that \u201dAmerica\u2019s Dad\u201d could be a serial rapist. Now that no fewer than 58 women have come forward saying Cosby sexually assaulted them, the sheer weight of testimony is hard to ignore. Even so, Cosby still has his defenders.",
        "Chelsea Clinton made an astonishing claim at a campaign event for her mother last week: Bernie Sanders has a plan that could cost millions of Americans access to their health insurance. Related health care, explained \u201dSen. Sanders wants to dismantle Obamacare, dismantle the CHIP program, dismantle Medicare, and dismantle private insurance,\u201d she said during a campaign stop in New Hampshire, according to NBC News.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign has spent the past few days indulging its worst instincts. It blundered into a dumb attack on Bernie Sanders, but rather than back down it raised the stakes. The result has been a reminder, to liberals, of what they like about Sanders and mistrust about Clinton. But it\u2019s also been a missed opportunity for Clinton to make the case to Democratic primary voters that she should have been making all along. The subject was Sanders\u2019s support for a health care system.",
        "Bernie Sanders\u2019s argument in favor of health care is pretty simple. \u201dThe United States is the only major nation in the industrialized world that does not guarantee health care as a right to its people,\u201d Sanders said at a 2015 rally of the National Nurses Union, one of the leading advocacy groups in favor of moving to a approach. \u201dMeanwhile, we spend far more per capita on health care with worse results than other countries.",
        "For teachers in Singapore to advance in their career, they must make sure their students learn. They also have to help their fellow teachers get better. This model of collaborative professional development is one way other countries are doing a better job than the United States at improving the skills of educators. While the US spends billions of dollars a year for occasional workshops on the latest technology or curriculum trends, there\u2019s almost no evidence to suggest that the model works.",
        "The Fox Business debate on January 14 was the liveliest of the Republican presidential contests since the first Fox News event last August, when America first experienced the spectacle of Donald Trump on a debate stage. Trump and Ted Cruz, who have spent most of this campaign in a tacit truce, finally went at it, and it was glorious. Marco Rubio was more energized than we\u2019ve seen him in a long while, though neither he nor Cruz seemed to understand what a VAT is.",
        "Congress, against all odds, appears to be working again. While gridlock has been the norm since Republicans retook the House in 2011, last year legislators succeeded in permanently fixing Medicare doctor payments, passing a highway funding bill, replacing No Child Left Behind, extending the solvency of the Social Security disability program, and making a whole raft of tax breaks for families and corporations permanent. As far as 2016 is concerned, the odds of progress are looking good on one topic where you\u2019d never expect the parties to agree: foreign aid.",
        "Sarah, Ezra, and Matt take the occasion of the State of the Union to take stock of the successes and failures of Barack Obama\u2019s administration \u2014 especially his efforts to change politics and rescue the economy. Then they consider Hillary Clinton\u2019s latest line of attack on Bernie Sanders and discuss some new research into Obamacare\u2019s impact on jobs and hours worked.

        "Every Chipotle restaurant will close for several hours today, February 8, so that the company can hold an unprecedented meeting to discuss issues related to the chain\u2019s food safety crisis. Multiple outbreaks of food contamination of varying levels of severity have pummeled the chain in recent months. Here\u2019s the announcement notice on my local Chiptole, explaining vaguely that \u201dwe\u2019re closed for lunch today to attend a meeting with all other Chipotle employees\u201d without mentioning the bacteria that have caused the meeting.",

        "In the 24 hours after Iran detained and then released the sailors on two small US Navy boats that had drifted into Iranian waters in the Persian Gulf, there was, as I and many others have written, a brief and tremendously silly freakout in the US over an incident that had been quickly and peacefully resolved. But behind that silliness, there was indeed a legitimately serious issue here: hints of the divisions in Iran, just beneath the surface, between moderate versus factions jostling to pull the country in two very different directions.",
        "In 1998, a West Virginia high school teacher named Ann Klinestiver was prescribed a drug called Requip to treat the tremors she suffered from due to Parkinson\u2019s disease. The drug worked, curing her tremors. But eventually something strange happened: Klinestiver, who\u2019d never been a gambler, suddenly became an obsessive slot machine player. She\u2019d spend 18 hours at a time playing the slots, neglecting all other responsibilities. She lost $250, 000 and separated from her husband before she was taken off the drug in 2004 \u2014 at which point her gambling obsession disappeared within a week.",
        "Nobody is under the impression that the Oscars seriously reward the best films of the year. The awards have a spotty track record, having given their top prize to far more mediocre films than great ones. But they\u2019re a unique window into what Hollywood thinks about itself, what it values. Every year, we get a sense of the kinds of movies Hollywood thinks it should be making.",
        "The 88th annual Academy Award nominations were announced this morning from Los Angeles. You can watch the announcement above. The Revenant led all films with 12 nominations, followed closely by Mad Max: Fury Road with 10. The Martian landed in third with seven nominations. The Academy chose to nominate eight films for Best Picture this year, as it did last year, and they ranged from small, quiet stories like Brooklyn to the action movie bombast of Mad Max. It\u2019s a much better lineup than 2015\u2019s.",
        "On Friday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel alert, warning pregnant women to avoid visiting countries where the Zika virus has been circulating. Zika, which is carried from person to person by mosquitoes, has been linked to birth defects and deaths in newborns in Brazil. Though that country has been battling the largest Zika outbreak, with more than a million people infected, the virus has also been detected in Colombia, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, Venezuela, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.",

        "The last time that Jason Rezaian felt freedom, which Iranian state media today announced will finally be restored, was in July 2014. He spent most of that month as he had many months before it, living and reporting in Iran, where one of his parents was born and where he holds citizenship, along with a US passport. He reported, as a writer for the Washington Post, on stories that humanized Iran and the people who live there, as well as on the nascent signs of an opening between the US and Iran for which Jason was hopeful.",
        "The Hillary Clinton campaign is taking some hard knocks from liberals over its maladroit attacks on Bernie Sanders\u2019 proposal. In one sense, the knocks are . Even if markedly lowers medical expenditures, proponents such as Larry Seidman estimate that a tax increase of at least 8 percent of GDP would likely be required to finance it. That\u2019s a heavy political lift. It\u2019s about as much as the entire federal income tax on individuals.",
        "Update: Back in December, the University of Maryland issued a press release claiming a single brand of chocolate milk could improve concussion recovery. It was an absurd case of science hype (detailed below) and it left many wondering why a university was behaving like a marketing machine for a dairy company. Now there are some answers. The University of Maryland assembled a committee to figure out what went wrong and just released a report on April 1 detailing its findings and acknowledging the shortcomings of the research.",
        "13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi, Michael Bay\u2019s new film depicting the 2012 attacks that killed US Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans, sets out on a daring mission of its own. Bay wants to spend 140 minutes splashing around in what has since become one of the most politicized and heavily litigated incidents of the Obama administration, all while somehow avoiding, or more often simply ignoring, the points of controversy that litter the events.",
        "This week, two shooters opened fire on a workplace holiday party in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and wounding at least 21. Not much is known about the shooters yet, other than the fact that all four of their weapons were legally purchased, according to the New York Times. What we do know is that the events in San Bernardino are far from unique: Statistics show that there\u2019s a mass shooting, defined as one in in which at least four people shot, almost every day in America.",
        "With two weeks to go until the Iowa caucuses, the Democratic presidential race has finally kicked off in earnest, all thanks to a spat between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders over the merits of health care.",
        "Originally published on Grist. It\u2019s finally raining in California \u2014 just when we\u2019d begun to think that it would never rain again. But the state is deep in water debt. Traditionally, California has depended on snowmelt for about a third of its water. The recent storms have gotten California\u2019s snowpack up to slightly above average for this time of year, but it\u2019s going to take a lot more than that to refill reservoirs. First, the good news: snow! Compare the current snowpack (above) to this time last year. Why are we seeing more snow?",
        "Conventional maps, by their nature, emphasize sheer spaciousness even though many large areas can be relatively devoid of human beings or other forms of activity. This cool diagram from HowMuch. net gives us a different way to visualize the entire US economy, depicting the whole thing as a big circle and then slicing it up by state, with each state\u2019s area representing its share of total economic output: The basic news that California and Texas are really big shouldn\u2019t come as a huge shock.",

        "Two hours before the Democratic presidential debate in Charleston, South Carolina, on Sunday night, Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) released a detailed plan explaining how he\u2019d pay for federally run, health insurance for all Americans \u2014 \u201dMedicare for all,\u201d as he calls it. You can read the plan here: Bernie Sanders\u2019s \u201dMedicare for All\u201d plan The plan follows a week of attacks from Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign against Sanders\u2019s health care thinking, assailing Sanders for not explaining how he\u2019d pay for the idea, and for seeming to renege on a promise to release the plan before the Iowa caucuses.",
        "Da Amazing Voice Inflection Device, known to scientists as DAVID, is like an for emotion. (And yes, that is its actual name). In real time, psychologists can create a steady, unemotional voice like this one. ... . ..and then tweak it to make it sound scared: . ...or happy: . ..or sad: This program was developed for psychologists, so that they could test how people respond to different emotions in a laboratory setting. Higher pitches sound happier, lower ones sound sadder, and trembly voices are more afraid. Playing with these pitches, scientists recently found some very curious results."
