        "Originally published on Ensia. Try navigating the soggy, waterlogged slopes of Kenya\u2019s largest slum, with its hundreds of thousands of ramshackle houses, and you\u2019ll quickly realize why Kibera is named after a Nubian word meaning \u201djungle.\u201d Pasted and propped along the banks of the Nairobi River in Kenya\u2019s capital, Kibera\u2019s illegally constructed houses are packed together so densely you can barely see a sliver of the red dirt holding them up. Though estimates vary greatly, between 500, 000 and 1 million people likely live in this ( ) settlement.",
        "A new study finds that sexism is rampant in the tech industry, with almost of women reporting sexual harassment and nearly 90 percent reporting demeaning comments from male colleagues. The study, called \u201dElephant in the Valley,\u201d surveyed 200 women who work at tech companies, including large companies like Google and Apple as well as startups. The study focused on women who had 10 years of experience in the industry, and most worked in Silicon Valley. The project was inspired by former Reddit CEO Ellen Pao\u2019s failed gender discrimination suit against her former venture capital firm.",
        "Netflix is notoriously with its viewership numbers, preferring vague proclamations of success to releasing statistics that could otherwise be torn apart. But NBC claims to have cracked the code. On Wednesday, during the Television Critics Association winter press tour, NBC hosted a lunch including a \u201dNetflix Reality Check\u201d for reporters.",
        "Sunday night\u2019s Democratic debate was, DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz insisted, timed to \u201dmaximize the opportunity for voters to see our candidates.\u201d Given that it was held on the Sunday before a federal holiday, that seems \u2026 dubious. But whoever wasn\u2019t deterred by the debate\u2019s inauspicious timing saw an event that was both substantive and sort of lackadaisical. Almost all the discussion focused on policy, but Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton began awkwardly attempting to slip in attacks on each other, though neither really seemed that comfortable doing it.",
        "Hillary Clinton has made a lot of bad arguments about Bernie Sanders\u2019s support for . But her best argument was her simplest: With mere weeks to go before the Iowa caucuses, Sanders still hadn\u2019t released any details about his plan. And absent a real plan, no one could really say what he was proposing or whether it was a good idea.",
        "Director Spike Lee, who recently received an honorary Oscar for his long career in film \u2014 a career that has produced classics like Do the Right Thing, Malcolm X, and 25th Hour \u2014 will not be attending this year\u2019s Academy Awards, due to the dearth of nominees of color. #OscarsSoWhite. ..

        "The story of Flint, Michigan\u2019s children being poisoned by drinking water has, rightly, shocked and scandalized the nation. But while the situation in Flint is certainly an extreme case, the problem is much more widespread than many realize: Children in essentially every city in America are being exposed to hazardous levels of toxic lead, and very little is being done about it.",
        "It seems like conventional wisdom: The drinking age should be 18. After all, why should you be able to vote or serve your country in the military, but not legally buy a drink? But there\u2019s a very compelling case for keeping the drinking age at 21: It saves lives. That may be hard to believe, given how many people flout the laws and drink anyway, but it\u2019s been consistently found to be true in research. Related I have a job and a house. I can vote and join the military. Why can\u2019t I drink?",
        "Just before the New Year, a Hong Kong bookseller named Lee Bo disappeared. Lee specializes in books banned in the rest of the country. His whereabouts had been unknown until Monday, when Chinese authorities confirmed that he was on the mainland. It\u2019s still unclear whether they\u2019re the ones who brought him there \u2014 that is, whether they had abducted him from Hong Kong. Lee is one of five Hong Kong booksellers to disappear in recent months, all five of whom are employed by the Mighty Current publishing house.",
        "Like most journalists, I\u2019ve been covering Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 primary campaign as fundamentally more about making a point than about electing a president. He\u2019s out there to talk about his issues, to shift the terms of the debate, and to force Hillary Clinton to commit herself to progressive causes. And it\u2019s been working. Working so well that polls show Sanders steadily narrowing the gap with Clinton in national polls, while pulling even with her in Iowa and ahead in New Hampshire. Working so well that Sanders\u2019s debate performances have now turned much sharper, more detailed, and on point.",
        "Stephen Colbert and DeRay McKesson, a leader of the Black Lives Matter movement, on Monday traded seats while on The Late Show \u2014 in a move, Colbert said, to check his privilege as a wealthy, white show host. \u201dI have a show. I have a lot of money,\u201d Colbert said, as he sat at the host\u2019s desk. \u201dSo the fact I\u2019m sitting here and you\u2019re sitting there is part of that white privilege.\u201d \u201dIt\u2019s about role, and it\u2019s about access,\u201d McKesson said. \u201dWhat you can do is extend that privilege, so that you can dismantle it. Right?",
        "On a recent cold morning in Washington DC, I looked up the weather. The temperature was 38\u00b0F, but with winds occasionally gusting to 8 miles per hour, the wind chill was officially 32\u00b0F. Freezing. Except it wasn\u2019t actually freezing. There weren\u2019t any puddles on the streets turning into ice. The precipitation that was falling was clearly coming down as rain. And Weather Underground reported that it \u201dfelt like\u201d 36\u00b0F. The wind chill indicator gave a misleading picture of what things were really like outside.",
        "For the first time in more than a decade, Mercury, Mars, Venus, Saturn, and Jupiter \u2014 the five planets bright enough to be seen with an unaided eye \u2014 will all be visible at once in the sky. You\u2019ll have to wake up early to catch it. Starting January 20, it will be possible to see all five planets in a row, about 45 minutes before sunrise, Sky and Telescope reports.

        "Human beings have replaced nature as the dominant force shaping Earth. We\u2019ve cleared away forests, dammed up mighty rivers, paved vast roads, and transported thousands of species around the world. \u201dTo a large extent,\u201d two scientists wrote in 2015, \u201dthe future of the only place where life is known to exist is being determined by the actions of humans.\u201d So what does this look like? In recent decades, NASA has been tracking the major transformations we\u2019ve wrought via satellite.",
        "The Supreme Court has agreed to take up the lawsuit over President Obama\u2019s 2014 executive actions on immigration, which would allow millions of unauthorized immigrants to apply for protection from deportation. The court will hear and decide on the case, United States v. Texas, by summer 2016. 26 states sued the federal government to stop the executive actions. A federal judge in Texas sided with the states in February 2015, and the Fifth Circuit upheld the ruling in November 2015.",
        "A shocking new poll today shows Bernie Sanders not just beating Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire but crushing her \u2014 the poll finds him up 60 percent to 33 percent among likely Democratic primary voters in the state, a far greater lead than Sanders has ever held before. But while it\u2019s safe to assume Sanders is up in the Granite State \u2014 and probably by a significant margin \u2014 we should take that enormous margin here with a grain of salt. It\u2019s best to look at the averages of recent polls, not just outliers.",
        "Members of Congress now make $174, 000 a year \u2014 not a bad living. But usually they can at least quintuple that salary by switching over to lobbying once they retire. And many of them do just that. A new study by three political scientists has some good data on the trends. Jeffrey Lazarus, Amy McKay, and Lindsey Herbel went all the way back to 1976 to see who went on to lobby after leaving Congress. Their results are reported in a new article, \u201dWho walks through the revolving door?",
        "In September 2008, Fox introduced Fringe, a science fiction show created by J. J. Abrams and Alex Kurtzman. It\u2019s the story of FBI agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) who tries to solve cases with a strange team that includes Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) a brilliant but slightly insane scientist whose specialty is \u201dfringe\u201d or pseudoscience; his equally brilliant son, Peter (Joshua Jackson); assistant Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole); and Colonel Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick).",
        "Fresh on the heels of a dustup over health care, a new fight between the Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders campaigns is exposing some rifts between the two camps. This time the fight is over how the candidates handle identity politics and who is part of the \u201destablishment\u201d that needs to be challenged. Rachel Maddow asked Sanders Tuesday night about Hillary Clinton\u2019s recent endorsements from the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates for LGBTQ rights, and from Planned Parenthood, which is endorsing a presidential candidate for the first time.",
        "Humans of the East Coast, listen: A major, major winter storm is underway. Washington, DC, Baltimore, New York, and Philadelphia are all in line for what forecasters say could be a historic amount of snow. While forecasts may change, the storm is currently expected to bring more than a foot of snow to some major cities, along with whiteout conditions, high winds, and major coastal flooding. The National Weather Service has issued a blizzard warning for most of the From Virginia to Long Island, New York.",
        "Hillary Clinton has come up with a plan to blunt Bernie Sanders\u2019s attacks from the left: reframe them as attacks not on her policies but on President Barack Obama\u2019s record. If Sanders is going to lay claim to being the better liberal, Clinton is going to lay claim to being the better Democrat. Clinton\u2019s strategy was in clear evidence during Sunday\u2019s Democratic debate, where on question after question she tried to drive a wedge between Sanders and liberals by recasting his proposals and principles as criticisms of Obama. And if you happened to head to HillaryClinton.",
        "On January 5, the Council on Relations offered a new service for the Muslim American families among its members: It released a guide titled \u201dA Muslim parent\u2019s guide to talking to children about acts of violent extremism.\u201d It was meant to help parents guide their children through a new world in which the tide of Islamophobia, as well as the threat of violent extremism, is growing. The guide reflects a difficult new truth: Muslim parents in the US and Canada today no longer just have to worry about giving their kids the \u201dbirds and the bees\u201d talk.",
        "The East Coast might face a massive snowstorm this weekend, one that meteorologists say could be of \u201dhistoric\u201d proportions. There are lots of fun things to do during a snowstorm, like drink hot chocolate and build snowmen. But there is one specific thing that pretty much everyone should avoid during a big snowstorm \u2014 the thing you should keep in mind as you make preparations for this week. Do not, if you can possibly avoid it, drive anywhere. Alan Black and Thomas Mote at the University of Georgia compared deaths from travel with those from other weather events.",
        "The opioid painkiller and heroin epidemic has led to a record number of deadly drug overdoses, with the US recording an high of 52, 000 overdose deaths \u2014 almost of which were \u2014 in 2015. In states like New Hampshire, the crisis is so bad that it\u2019s overtaken the economy and national security as voters\u2019 top concern. But as awareness of the crisis grows, one of the more exotic policy ideas for dealing with the epidemic has gotten relatively little attention: legalizing medical marijuana.",
        "Update the record books: 2015 was the hottest year on Earth since we first started keeping track, thanks to the combination of global warming and a powerful El Ni\u00f1o. No other year has even come close: The declaration comes from two separate analyses released today by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) finding that 2015 was the hottest year globally since records first began in 1880. NASA says this past year was a full 0. 9\u00b0C (1. 62\u00b0F) hotter than the average, and 0. 13\u00b0C (0. 23\u00b0F) hotter than 2014, the previous .",
        "We\u2019ve rarely admitted it, but the debate in the United States over the Iran nuclear deal, which formally began this Saturday as the world lifted many sanctions on Iran, was never really about nuclear weapons. Not primarily, anyway. Sure, the nuclear deal itself has a lot to do with nuclear weapons. But it should tell you something that America\u2019s debate over the deal is still raging even after Iran has disassembled the bulk of its nuclear program, and that we\u2019re now having nearly identical arguments about the prisoner swap and the boat incident.",
        "In January, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel alert: American women of childbearing age, whether pregnant or not, were told to avoid countries where the Zika virus has been circulating. At the same time, women in countries that already have Zika outbreaks have been told to avoid getting pregnant. That\u2019s because Zika, a tropical disease carried from person to person by mosquitoes, has been linked to birth defects and deaths in newborns in Brazil. Brazil has been battling the largest Zika outbreak yet, with more than a million people infected.",
        "Netflix\u2019s Making a Murderer has come under a lot of internet scrutiny. Critics claim that the true crime documentary, which chronicles the story of murder suspect Steven Avery, left out a lot of evidence and misrepresented some people, including Jodi Stachowski, Avery\u2019s . Now the documentary\u2019s creators have responded to those criticisms. Before we start, if you want to get caught up on the discussion surrounding the documentary and all the missing evidence, read Vox\u2019s explainer. This post only covers the creators\u2019 response.",
        "Dietary supplements are barely regulated in the United States. The makers of these pills \u2014 which are commonly sold at pharmacies, natural health stores, and gyms \u2014 don\u2019t need to prove their products are safe or even effective before putting them on store shelves. It was that fact that prompted Soo Oh and me to comb through government databases, court documents, and scientific studies to find out what dubious ingredients have been found to lurk in popular supplements.",
        "Martin Luther King Jr. often used characters in his sermons. Given that he was a Baptist preacher, they were usually biblical figures, like the 12 apostles, Moses, and Lazarus. But he also drew from a wide array of innovative thinkers, both ancient and contemporary. He cited Plato, Socrates, and Aristotle. He explored Hamlet and Macbeth and Rip Van Winkle. He quoted poets with three names \u2014 Henry David Thoreau, William Cullen Bryant, James Russell Lowell. But most frequently, he spoke of politicians and activists \u2014 often his friends, sometimes his heroes, and even his enemies."
