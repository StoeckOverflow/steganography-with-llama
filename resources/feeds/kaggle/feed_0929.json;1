        "Meteorologists and weather reporters are running out of adjectives to describe the blizzard that is set to hit the East Coast this weekend.",
        "We already know that about half of Texas\u2019s abortion clinics were forced to close as a result of the omnibus bill HB2 \u2014 a bill that will face a major Supreme Court challenge in March. And we have some research about what happened to abortion access after that: women forced to delay their abortion procedures due to longer waits for appointments at overburdened clinics, fewer women getting clinical abortions overall, and at least some women taking matters into their own hands by at home.",
        "When President Obama was unable to pass climate legislation in 2009 and \u201910, he turned to the Clean Air Act to regulate carbon emissions. Critics cast this as an unprecedented expansion of Environmental Protection Agency authority, but in fact it was part of a long tradition in US environmental law, which has seen a few foundational pieces of legislation evolve and grow ever since they were passed decades ago.",
        "Apostrophes are by far the most misused and abused punctuation mark in the English language. Many people seem to have absolutely no idea how to use them. Are they to pluralize? Are they for contractions? Are they meant to indicate a possessive? The answer is all of the above. That\u2019s what makes apostrophes so confusing to many people: They\u2019re so versatile that it\u2019s hard to gauge when it\u2019s not right to use them. It shows. Apostrophe catastrophes are so common that they\u2019ve even inspired a genre of writing \u2014 including at Vox!",
        "Bernie Sanders has talked a lot about a \u201dMedicare for all\u201d plan, releasing a proposal last Sunday for a public health plan that would cover all Americans. But when you look at the details of the plan and the structure of health benefits there, it becomes clear that Sanders\u2019s plan isn\u2019t Medicare at all. Sanders seems to use \u201dMedicare for all\u201d as a catchall term to describe a publicly run insurance program. My colleague Ezra Klein wrote about that in detail here: Sanders calls his plan \u201dMedicare for all.\u201d But it actually has nothing to do with Medicare.",
        "Even after the Iran nuclear deal was formally implemented on Saturday, debate continues, and will likely continue for some time, over whether it was worth striking or whether it was, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu deemed it, a \u201dhistoric mistake.\u201d The debate has always turned on a counterfactual: \u201dIf not this deal, then what?\u201d Critics argue that Obama administration officials could have gotten a better deal if they\u2019d just tried harder, been tougher on Iran, or waited longer.",
        "There has been story after story about the water crisis in Flint, Michigan. Vox has covered it extensively  \u2014   from what the national media got wrong about the crisis to how lead exposure is a race issue to the national issue of lead in the soil of many American cities, plus a big explainer if you want to go deeper.  But while the story has developed over the course of years, sometimes you just need the thing explained to you in three minutes.  You came to the right place.",
        "One of the sharpest and clearest points of contrast between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton regards his desire to \u201dbreak up\u201d the largest Wall Street banks. According to Sanders, a bank that is too big to fail is too big to exist, a theme he offered as the title of his major legislation on the subject. But Sanders has gone beyond offering dream legislation to suggest that if he is elected president he will achieve a bank breakup within one year, whether Congress likes it or not.",
        "On Wednesday evening, Washington, DC received a mere inch of snow during rush hour \u2014 and it turned into a total clusterfuck. The roads were already cold, so that thin layer of snow turned into slippery ice. Road crews were slow to clear and salt the streets because they were overly focused on preparing for the big blizzard expected to hit this Friday. And everyone was trying to get home for the evening. The result? Horrific traffic jams for miles: An inch of snow triggered a traffic mess in Washington, D. C.",
        "When Sarah Palin endorsed Donald Trump on Tuesday, the result can only be described as Palinesque. The rambling speech included both a call to \u201dkick ISIS\u2019s ass\u201d and a reference to her audience as \u201dright wingin\u2019 bitter clingin\u2019 proud clingers.\u201d Palin\u2019s remarks also show the kinship she and Trump share as candidates who are primarily and who rejoice in irritating Republican elites. Here\u2019s the full speech, annotated to put Palin\u2019s references, positions, and policies in context. Thank you so much. It\u2019s so great to be here in Iowa. We\u2019re here just thawing out.",
        "Three years ago, the Zika virus was nowhere to be found in the Western Hemisphere. But in 2015, Brazil suddenly found itself in the throes of an unprecedented Zika outbreak \u2014 with more than a million people infected by the disease. The vast majority had nothing to worry about, at worst getting a rash and symptoms. But recently, scientists have realized that Zika may pose a unique threat to pregnant women. Those infected with Zika during pregnancy appear to be able to transmit the virus to their fetuses.",
        "This week saw the publication of the second autism history from a major publisher in the past year. Just as the autism world was beginning to absorb the bombshell of Steve Silberman\u2019s NeuroTribes, published in August, Caren Zucker and John Donvan released In a Different Key. As both an autistic person and someone who spends his days working on autism and disability policy, I\u2019m fairly familiar with the history of autism (and am a minor character in each book). But both contain surprising new revelations. Two books, two approaches Silberman made his name as a reporter for Wired magazine.",
        "National Review published more than 20 essays from conservative writers on Friday arguing that the Republican Party should not nominate Donald Trump for president. The columns all reach the same conclusion, but the reasoning behind them varies considerably from piece to piece. Understanding why the country\u2019s leading conservative thinkers are taking a stand against Trumpism has consequences \u2014 not only for this election but also for the trajectory of conservative thought.",
        "States have passed 288 abortion restrictions in the past five years \u2014 an entire quarter of those enacted since the Supreme Court recognized a legal right to abortion. When the Supreme Court ruled, in the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, that women had a legal right to abortion, states responded with a wave of restrictions. That year alone, states passed 81 laws that limited abortion access, things like waiting periods prior to the procedure or requiring the consent of a woman\u2019s spouse. But the restrictions of 1973 are dwarfed by recent activity.",
        "Who would the Republican Party prefer to have as its 2016 presidential nominee: Donald Trump or Ted Cruz? When this topic first came up in the waning months of 2015, many assumed the answer was simple. Obviously, the party\u2019s establishment would prefer Cruz \u2014 an ideological elected conservative, albeit a very extreme one \u2014 to a takeover by a loose cannon, ideologically heterodox billionaire. Indeed, Matt Yglesias argued in December that Cruz could be the GOP\u2019s \u201dlast best hope\u201d of stopping Trump.",
        "There\u2019s an important idea at the core of Bernie Sanders\u2019s campaign, one that was on full display at the last Democratic debate. The Vermont senator argues that the true source of congressional dysfunction isn\u2019t polarization at all. Instead, he says, it\u2019s money: Big interests have enough power to sway both parties in either direction. On this week\u2019s episode of The Weeds, Ezra, Matt, and I pick apart Sanders\u2019s argument, thinking about recent legislation in Congress and the role of large interests.",
        "There\u2019s a constant conflict between social scientists and the reporters who cover them. It\u2019s derived from \u201da fundamental tension between the media\u2019s desire for novelty and the scientific method,\u201d as Sanjay Srivastava, who researches personality at the University of Oregon, tells me. He\u2019s right. Journalists have a need for digestible headlines that convey simple, accessible, and preferably novel lessons. The scientific method stresses a slow accumulation of knowledge, nuance, and doubt.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign is going on the attack against Bernie Sanders, and somewhat oddly has chosen to hit him 1) from the right, even though this is the Democratic primary, and 2) on Iran policy, which is a pretty minor issue for Democratic voters. Clinton\u2019s attack line also turns out to be false. If all that seems bizarre and politically unsound to you, I had the same reaction.",
        "The Daily Show\u2019s Jessica Williams has made her mark on history: Last night, Williams said that Whitesboro, New York, is working to change its controversial \u201dracist\u201d seal after weeks of public pressure, including from The Daily Show. Here is the seal, which appears to depict a white man choking a Native American: Whitesboro\u2019s residents say the seal depicts Hugh White, the town\u2019s founder, and an Oneida Indian in a friendly wrestling match. But the symbol has drawn criticism from around the country for looking like a white man choking a Native American.",
        "The Iowa caucuses are 10 days away, so naturally everyone is talking about \u2026 Bernie Sanders\u2019s position on reparations? This week, a controversy has arisen around Sanders\u2019s recent statement that he does not support reparations for black Americans \u2014 payments to compensate for centuries of US policies that oppressed black people \u2014 partly because he doesn\u2019t think they could ever be enacted. This strikes some as hypocritical because Sanders, a democratic socialist, supports many policies that seem just as politically unrealistic, like health care. The critics in some ways misunderstand Sanders\u2019s views on this issue.",
        "The city of Flint, Michigan, is in the midst of a terrible and rightly shocking lead poisoning crisis. The number of kids testing positive for elevated lead levels in their bloodstreams has doubled in the past few years, after the city switched to a new, cheaper water source. This is an extreme case, but the problem of lead exposure among children is not a local Flint story. If you look at public health data, you begin to realize two things.",
        "Matt Yglesias As people have started taking Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign more seriously, something that\u2019s come up is a lot of more people are noticing that his policy proposals \u2014 especially on health care but also to an extent on bank regulation \u2014 are a bit hazy and don\u2019t stand up to a ton of scrutiny on details. I\u2019ve written some stories making those criticisms, and some pushback I\u2019ve gotten is that it doesn\u2019t really matter. Everyone knows presidential proposals don\u2019t become law and the details need to be hashed out with congress. Ezra Klein Right.",
        "Tuesday night saw the return of Agent Carter, Marvel\u2019s delightful, offbeat spy show featuring the indomitable Hayley Atwell. Agent Carter is a triumph \u2014 it\u2019s fun and cheeky, yet its female hero is dynamic and strong. And it\u2019s become something of a benchmark, a promise of what Marvel is capable of when it comes to women characters (see also: Jessica Jones).",
        "North Korea has arrested Otto Frederick Warmbier, a student at the University of Virginia who was in the country on a tour, for committing a \u201dhostile act,\u201d the nation\u2019s news agency announced January 22. Related The single most important fact for understanding North Korea Warmbier is in his third year at the University of Virginia. He was in North Korea with Young Pioneer Tours, a company founded in 2008.",
        "Five people have been killed and two more are critically injured in a school shooting in remote northern Saskatchewan, Canada, on Friday afternoon. The shooter is in custody, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday afternoon. Trudeau described the news as \u201devery parent\u2019s worst nightmare.\u201d The shooting, in La Loche, Saskatchewan, happened at about 1:30 pm at a community school enrolling all ages of students. Local media reported the shooting was at the portion of the school serving through students. No details are yet known about the victims or the shooter.",
        "Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has instructed his aides to draw up plans for a potential challenge in this year\u2019spresidential race, the New York Times is reporting. Earlier this month, reports emerged that the former mayor, disgusted bythe continued dominance of Donald Trump in the Republican field, was\u201dmulling a run.\u201d Bloomberg went so far as to commission a poll to see how he would fare against Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the assumed (but not determined) Democratic .",
        "The heart of Donald Trump\u2019s strategy to win the Republican presidential nomination is his massive, electric, occasionally violent campaign rallies. Using tactics that owe a little to church revivals and a lot to insult comedy, Trump skillfully directs his audience\u2019s excitement (toward himself) and their resentment (often toward the members of the media in attendance). Reporters have gotten used to this by now. But here\u2019s still one thing that befuddles them: Trump\u2019s playlist. Specifically, many of them wonder: Why does Trump play so many songs from British Broadway musical composer Andrew Lloyd Webber?!",
        "For as long as we\u2019ve been around, humans have lived with insects. From the earliest cave dwellings to McMansions, it\u2019s been impossible to find a human dwelling that\u2019s . But surprisingly little is known about the bugs thriving in the cracks and crannies of our homes. So recently, entomologists completed what they say is the first census of the arthropod (a classification that includes insects and spiders) species that live in the typical American home. Assessing 50 houses in the vicinity of Raleigh, North Carolina, they found a stunning diversity of critters.",
        "Hillary Clinton and her supporters are getting worried about Bernie Sanders and his. It\u2019s pretty obvious why: Because of this, the Democratic side of the race is going through a lurching transition. Until very recently, it was a model primary. The establishment candidate was being challenged by an insurgent, who was pulling her left on a few key issues. It was all above the belt, a good warmup for Clinton and a healthy set of debates for the party. But now Sanders has built organization and momentum that make him more than a protest candidate.",
        "On October 20, Bashar quietly slipped out of Syria for the first time since his country\u2019s civil war had begun, four years and a quarter million lives earlier, and flew to Moscow for an awkward, and by all accounts chilly, meeting with Vladimir Putin. Assad, lanky and shy, stood awkwardly over the shorter, gregarious Putin for photos at the Kremlin, released only after Assad had safely returned home. To Americans, it might have looked like two allies conspiring, a alliance suddenly growing closer."
