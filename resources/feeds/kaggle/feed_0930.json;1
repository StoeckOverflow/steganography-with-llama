        "One of the most effective ways to help poor people, especially in poor countries, is to just give them money. There\u2019s a large empirical literature on cash transfer now, and the results are very positive, with various studies finding that just handing out money increases consumption, encourages investments in important assets like metal roofs, encourages more people to start working, boosts earnings, and doesn\u2019t lead to more spending on things like alcohol or tobacco.",
        "If you\u2019re celebrating Star Wars Day today, you might be choosing your own lightsaber color or reading up about the upcoming Episode VIII. If you\u2019re a Star Wars newbie like me, May the Fourth is a new holiday. Star Wars: Episode VII \u2014 The Force Awakens is the only Star Wars movie I\u2019ve ever seen. Really.",
        "How did a police officer end up in a classroom, throwing a teenage girl from one side of the room to the other? Why do police officers so often respond to mental health crises, shooting someone who needed medical care? Perhaps the problem in these situations isn\u2019t only how a police officer responded, but that a police officer was called to the scene at all. And this is a view held not just by the public \u2014 but by many police officers too. In a TED talk about policing, Baltimore Police Lt.",
        "Originally published on Ensia. Roger Deal is trying to figure out how plants remember drought. An assistant professor of biochemistry and genetics at Emory University, Deal says most plants have a kind of memory for stress. When experiencing water shortage, for example, plants close the holes in their leaves, called stomata, to reduce water loss from their tissues. This, in turn, slows photosynthesis and plant growth. If the plants recover and go through a similar situation again, their cells somehow recall what that stress was like, so they\u2019re able to bounce back more rapidly.",
        "The Flint water crisis has captured national attention, but, paradoxically, one benefit of city services failing as egregiously as they have in Flint is that many families have been able to largely avoid the toxic water that was pumping into the city\u2019s homes. Urban soil lead, by contrast, is a problem that slips past people unnoticed. So unnoticed, in fact, that there is actually a higher incidence of children in nearby Detroit, where the water is fine, than there is in Flint.",
        "In the ninth episode of Mad Dogs\u2019 first season, a character falls down an unmarked sinkhole in the jungle. The character\u2019s friends then work to pull him out of said sinkhole, but the whole situation stands in, almost, as a metaphor for the new Amazon series\u2019 strengths and problems on the whole. Rating 3. 5 The rescue is, in and of itself, a surprisingly exciting and yet strangely weird sequence. It captures the sensation of being in some place you don\u2019t know and feeling very out of place.",
        "More Americans now identify as independents than as either Democrats or Republicans. Gallup tracks independents at 42 percent and Pew at 39 percent, the highest percentages in more than 75 years of polling. This stunning fact snuck up on both parties and much of the media this election season. As voters flock to outsider figures Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, the establishment and the media are flummoxed. But they shouldn\u2019t be. The rise of independents is a phenomenon political science research showed was coming and will only continue.",
        "Some stories are too good to check, and some myths are too perfect to bust. We\u2019ve seen that dynamic in action all month, as GOP presidential candidates trot out their favorite foreign policy anecdote: the Parable of the Hostages. The story goes that on the day of his inauguration, in January 1981, President Reagan convinced the Iranian regime to free the American Embassy hostages more or less just by glaring harshly in the direction of Tehran, which quailed in the face of his unyielding toughness and released the Americans immediately.",
        "The water in Flint, Michigan, isn\u2019t safe to drink, but most residents have alternatives. They can pick up bottled water at National Guard \u2014 operated distribution centers or, even better, obtain a filter that will remove the toxic amounts of lead from the city\u2019s public taps.

        "Here\u2019s a little story about corporate America. It\u2019s about how the capital class benefits, and workers get screwed, no matter the circumstances. It is depressing, if utterly typical. But it contains some zingy writing from a federal bureaucrat! And that\u2019s the sort of thing I like to celebrate. So read on.

        "1) It\u2019s been clear for years that Michael Bloomberg would like to be president, and even clearer that there is a network of political consultants who would like to get paid by Bloomberg\u2019s hypothetical presidential campaign. 2) The simultaneous breakdown of the implicit hierarchical structures of both major parties, as evidenced by the nomination of Bernie Sanders and either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz, would be about as good a chance as Bloomberg could possibly hope for. So it makes sense for Bloomberg to be looking seriously at a run if this happens.",
        "If you want to lose weight, there\u2019s one simple thing you can do that will definitely help \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t require starving yourself, avoiding gluten, or buying magic weight loss supplements. Just cook at home. The most recent scientific evidence for this advice comes in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, led by Tufts University researcher Lorien Urban. She and her examined the nutrition content of more than 360 dinner entrees at 123 restaurants in San Francisco, Boston, and Little Rock between 2011 and 2014.",
        "The award for most snow from the 2016 East Coast blizzard goes to Glengary, West Virginia, which saw 42 inches (3. 5 feet! ). The small town of a few hundred residents is about 8 miles away from the nearest gas station and grocery store, which \u201dmight as well have been in another state,\u201d Associated Press reports. \u201dNo one could go anywhere.\u201d Glengary wasn\u2019t the only place that broke records.

        "The US economy doesn\u2019t just grind to a halt every time there\u2019s a major blizzard. And for that, we can thank the 15 million tons of salt we dump on our roads and sidewalks each winter to melt away the snow and ice. There are huge upsides to salting the streets. One 1992 study found that spreading salt can reduce car accidents by 87 percent during and after a snowstorm. (The salt works by lowering the freezing temperature of water, preventing ice from forming.) allows traffic to keep moving, a benefit worth many billions of dollars.",
        "How dangerous does the United States government think El Salvador really is? Depending on how you look at it, the government\u2019s answer to that question is either nuanced or dangerously inconsistent. In January, Secretary of State John Kerry announced that the US will be devoting particular attention to finding and processing refugees in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala to bring to the United States. But the administration is simultaneously continuing the nationwide raids it started in the first days of 2016 to find and deport families who had failed to get asylum and been ordered to leave the country.",

        "In January, a Houston grand jury indicted two activists who were behind this summer\u2019s series of undercover Parenthood videos. The activists are David Daleiden, founder of the group that created and publicized the videos, and Sandra Merritt, who appeared with Daleiden in many of the videos. On Tuesday, the last criminal charge against Daleiden and Merritt was dismissed by Texas District Judge Brock Thomas. It was a felony charge of \u201dtampering with a governmental record,\u201d based on allegations that Daleiden and Merritt used falsified driver\u2019s licenses in the process of making the videos.",
        "Snowzilla, David Snowie, winter storm Jonas \u2014 whatever you want to call it \u2014 actually lived up to the hype: Communities from Virginia to Connecticut were buried under as much as 3. 5 feet of powder after more than 36 hours of steady snowfall.

        "President Barack Obama just agreed with something long alleged by Hillary Clinton supporters: The media scrutinized her more than Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary, an imbalance that favored Obama\u2019s campaign. \u201dThere were times where I think the media probably was a little unfair to her and tilted a little my way in the \u2014 in calling her out when she was tough and not calling some of our folks out as much when we were tough in ads,\u201d Obama told Politico\u2019s Glenn Thrush in an interview published Monday.",
        "Over the course of her extremely long life in American politics, Hillary Clinton has played many roles. And at the CNN candidates\u2019 forum in Iowa Monday night, she reminded us that one of those roles has been a moderately conservative Southern Democrat, a role she played starting in the late 1970s when her husband ran a successful campaign for attorney general of Arkansas and continued to play through the 1980s until the 1992 presidential campaign started up in earnest.",
        "For more than a decade, Apple has posted quarter after quarter of spectacular financial results, dazzling Wall Street and pushing Apple\u2019s stock to record highs. But that all changed on Tuesday, as the company reported that revenues for its most recent quarter \u2014 running from October to December of 2015 \u2014 were up just 2 percent from a year earlier. Profits also grew by just 2 percent. Sales of iPhones increased slightly, while sales of iPads and Macs were down. Many on Wall Street and in the media were disappointed by the results.",

        "President Barack Obama on Monday announced new restrictions on the use of solitary confinement in federal prisons \u2014 a move that will affect as many as 10, 000 inmates. Solitary confinement involves putting someone in a cell for hours, days, weeks, months, and even years with little to no contact with others. It is often used to discipline wrongdoers in prisons, but it\u2019s also deployed to protect inmates, including transgender prisoners, from others and segregate groups of people who are causing trouble. As many as 100, 000 prisoners are placed in solitary across the US each year.",
        "On Monday, the Supreme Court issued a ruling that had clean energy fans dancing in the streets (by which I mean excitedly updating their PowerPoint presentations). It represents a huge win for cheaper, cleaner electricity and for modern grid management. Unfortunately, it\u2019s pretty complicated and obscure. The case, FERC v. Electric Power Supply Association, turned on three things that the vast majority of normal human beings do not understand: 1) the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, 2) demand response, and 3) wholesale electricity markets.",
        "On one level, the Flint lead poisoning scandal is about a state mismanaging a city under financial duress and moving the city to a water supply that turned out to be unsafe. But on another level, it\u2019s also about something deeper: the vulnerabilities kids face when they grow up in poverty. They are more likely to have lower test scores, become teen mothers, and experience violent crime. And it\u2019s not just a lack of opportunity: A recent study found that the stresses of poverty actually stunt brain development.",

        "When you make a payment using Bitcoin, the recipient is supposed to get the money in less than an hour. But last summer, a few users started noticing that payments were taking a lot longer \u2014 12 hours in one case, 14 hours in another. The problem was that the Bitcoin network was getting too crowded to accommodate everyone who wanted to use it. In recent months, most payments are still going through without delays. But as Bitcoin continues to get more popular, congestion and slow payments are going to become a bigger and bigger problem.",
        "This is part two of our series on the war in Afghanistan. Part one explained why 2016 could be a very bad year for the country. Part three, to publish Wednesday, examines the role of Pakistan and other outside actors. Almost exactly one year ago, ISIS announced it was forming a new province not in Iraq or Syria, but far away in Afghanistan.

        "One of the most common arguments against America\u2019s legal drinking age is that Europe has a supposedly safer drinking culture despite its lower drinking ages. After I wrote an argument for keeping the US drinking age at 21, it\u2019s a question that readers raised in emails again and again: If a lower drinking age is so bad, why is Europe doing fine? The answer, it seems, is that Europe is not doing fine. If you look at the data, there\u2019s no evidence to support the idea that Europe, in general, has a safer drinking culture than the US.",
        "One of the scariest things about the Amtrak crash that killed eight people in May 2015 is that its cause is still mostly a mystery. As Matthew Shaer reports in a thorough, long article for the New York Times Magazine, when Amtrak 188 derailed in Philadelphia on May 12, the engineer, Brandon Bostian, had no alcohol or drugs in his system; he wasn\u2019t looking at his phone; and he was, by all accounts, totally devoted to his job."
