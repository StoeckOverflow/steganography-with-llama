        "Donald Trump escalated his feud with Fox News this week by playing what he believes is his ultimate trump card: blowing them off. Trump says he\u2019s not going to show up for the Republican debate Thursday night because of the scheduled moderator, Megyn Kelly \u2014 the longtime Fox News anchor and Kelly File host who has rankled Trump in the past. It\u2019s the final GOP showdown before the the Iowa caucuses on Monday, where Trump is surging in the polls but where there are also never guarantees.",
        "Here\u2019s one more reason to take Bernie Sanders\u2019s candidacy seriously: He has put forward statements and arguments on what is by far the most powerful lever a president has on the American economy \u2014 the chronically neglected subject of monetary policy. Sanders\u2019s Fed agenda cuts against the narrative of a campaign agenda at odds with wonks\u2019 preoccupations and political reality. It could use a little more polish and consultation with a wider range of experts, but it\u2019s certainly more detailed and substantive than anything Hillary Clinton (or, for that matter, Barack Obama) has said on the subject.",
        "Stefan L\u00fcpold is a sperm guy. The Swiss evolutionary biologist did his masters work on sexual selection and bat genitalia, his PhD on the evolution of bird sperm, and a postdoctorate on how fruit fly sperm compete. \u201dI\u2019m fascinated by the almost unlimited diversity in both size and shape of sperm,\u201d he writes me in an email from Zurich, describing his chosen . I\u2019ve emailed him because he\u2019s recently found evidence to answer a perplexing question: Why are sperm so weird? Mice, for instance, have sperm that\u2019s twice as long as elephants\u2019.",
        "Throughout the first half of its debut season, The CW\u2019s Crazy always found a way to explain its premise by barreling straight from incredulity into its manic theme song. A Rebecca (newly minted Golden Globe and Critics\u2019 Choice winner Rachel Bloom) would sing about being \u201dblue\u201d at her lawyer job in New York and how it inspired the impulsive decision that led her to West Covina, California \u2014 which is also the home of her childhood sweetheart Josh (Vincent Rodriguez III). But don\u2019t even worry about it, she constantly assured us. Josh is totally not why she\u2019s here!",
        "By the time it became clear to the world that Egypt\u2019s Arab Spring had gone terribly wrong, that the seemingly drama of protesters triumphing over dictator had turned out to be something much more disappointing, the other revolutions across the Middle East had soured as well. Today, Egypt is under a new military dictatorship; Libya, Yemen, and Syria have all collapsed into civil wars. In the years since everything went so wrong, it has become fashionable to blame the naivet\u00e9 of the revolutionaries or the petty incompetence of transitional leaders.",
        "Back in December, Congress did something it rarely does any more these days \u2014 struck a series of compromises and passed a bill, specifically a giant $1. 8 trillion spending bill. Among many other things, that bill extended the two key federal tax credits that support renewable energy: the production tax credit (PTC) which mostly goes to wind, and the investment tax credit (ITC) which goes to solar. It went by quickly in an otherwise month, so it\u2019s worth pausing a moment to note that for US renewable energy it was a very, very big deal.",
        "No topic provokes as much of an impassioned (and polite) discussion from our dear Midwestern friends and colleagues as which states are part of the Midwest. Is Ohio too far east to count? Is Oklahoma too far south? Does Kansas belong, or is it part of the Great Plains? Is that even a region? If you grew up in Los Angeles, like I did, you might consult Google. Sitting at the top of the search results, you\u2019ll find a Wikipedia article citing the US Census Bureau as the ultimate arbiter of Midwestern boundaries.",
        "Eleven members of the militia group that has occupied Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Burns, Oregon, have been arrested, including leader Ammon Bundy. Ammon Bundy and four others, including his brother Ryan Bundy, were arrested after a traffic stop, which resulted in a gunfight. It\u2019s not clear who shot first. Militia member Robert \u201dLaVoy\u201d Finicum was killed in the gunfire, and Ryan Bundy was shot in the arm. Two other militia leaders were arrested separately, and a third, Jon Eric Ritzheimer, turned himself in to authorities in Arizona, according to the Los Angeles Times.",
        "The Zika virus is spreading so quickly through the Western Hemisphere that it is soon expected to reach nearly every country in the Americas. The virus has already affected more than a million people in Brazil, and it\u2019s likely to reach the continental United States this year. Health officials are increasingly alarmed at this prospect. Most of the time, Zika causes no symptoms at all \u2014 or at worst, a rash, fever, and achy body. But there\u2019s mounting evidence that Zika can harm fetuses.",
        "Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he is skipping Thursday night\u2019s Fox News Republican debate because Megyn Kelly is hosting it, and he really doesn\u2019t like Megyn Kelly. Neither do Trump\u2019s supporters \u2014 and they are letting Kelly know it with vicious gendered insults on social media. A Vocativ analysis of 80, 000 tweets directed at Kelly\u2019s Twitter handle from Tuesday (when Trump announced his decision) through Wednesday morning found a torrent of misogynist hate. Most of the haters appeared to be on \u201dTeam Trump,\u201d according to Vocativ.",
        "One of the questions I get a lot is which political writers I try to read regularly. A mainstay on that list is New York Times columnist Ross Douthat. I don\u2019t always agree with Ross. But that\u2019s one reason I find reading him so valuable \u2014 he\u2019s a thoughtful and fair political analyst who comes at issues from a very different vantage point than I do.",
        "In January, Kristen Stewart came perilously close to joining the parade of white actors drawing furor over their response to the #OscarsSoWhite protests. Variety, reporting from the Sundance Film Festival, posted a clip of an interview with Stewart on January 25, and labeled it as her comment on the outcry over an overwhelmingly white slate of Oscar nominees. \u201dInstead of sitting around and complaining about that, do something,\u201d Stewart said in the video.",
        "Today is International Holocaust Remembrance Day \u2014 a day on which it\u2019s worth taking some time to actually understand what happened during the Nazi slaughter. One of the best ways to do that is to revisit the writing of Primo Levi, a Auschwitz survivor and one of the camp\u2019s greatest and most insightful literary documentarians. Of Levi\u2019s work, his essay \u201dThe Gray Zone\u201d \u2014 from The Drowned and the Saved, his final book before his 1987 suicide \u2014 really stands out.",
        "White and black Floridians wear their seat belts at roughly the same rates. One would think, then, that black drivers are about as likely to get ticketed by police officers for not wearing a seatbelt as white drivers. Nope. According to a new report by the American Civil Liberties Union, police in Florida were nearly twice as likely in 2014 to stop and ticket black drivers for seat belt violations \u2014 and that may be an underestimate, since at least one county with a history of racial disparities in seat belt citations stopped reporting its stats altogether.",
        "Donald Trump escalates a feud with Fox News; the FBI makes its move on the Oregon militia; and France loses a minister over controversial constitutional changes. Vox Sentences is written by Dylan Matthews and Dara Lind. TOP NEWS Donald Trump vs. Fox News Chip Images and Craig Images for Cosmopolitan Magazine and WME Live Fox News will be hosting a televised GOP presidential debate Thursday night. But as of Wednesday, frontrunner Donald Trump will not attend. [Donald J.",
        "There is no comedian right now as popular and as visible as Amy Schumer. Schumer is friends with Jennifer Lawrence. Schumer has become a pop culture symbol for feminism. Schumer\u2019s movie Trainwreck was nominated for a Golden Globe, a Critics\u2019 Choice Award, a People\u2019s Choice Award, and a Writers Guild of America Award. Everything Schumer touches turns into gold. But Schumer now faces an allegation that undermines her recent success: She\u2019s being called a plagiarist \u2014 a joke stealer. And it probably doesn\u2019t matter that the people who initially laid out those allegations have since retracted them.",
        "Like the kid in high school who is too cool for prom, Donald Trump has announced he will be hosting a special event in Des Moines, Iowa, in honor of veterans\u2019 organizations starting at the same time as the Fox News \u2014 sponsored GOP debate Thursday. BREAKING: Trump sticks to his guns: Special Event Thurs night in Des Moines at exact same time as GOP debate. pic. twitter. \u2014 Peter Alexander (@PeterAlexander) January 27, 2016 Since Trump announced he was considering not going, it was unclear how seriously to take the threat.",
        "The central premise of Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential bid is that he\u2019ll spark a \u201dpolitical revolution\u201d in America. \u201dToday,\u201d Sanders said as he announced his campaign last May, \u201dwe begin a political revolution to transform our country economically, politically, socially and environmentally.\u201d And what, exactly, does he mean by that? On its surface, the concept is simple: Sanders wants to organize and mobilize the people against the powerful \u2014 specifically, corporations and the wealthy.",
        "As Ted Cruz has risen to become Donald Trump\u2019s main rival in the Republican primary, it\u2019s become clear just how deeply much of the party\u2019s Washington establishment loathes him \u2014 to the point where many have still refused to endorse Cruz, and some say they\u2019d even prefer Trump to Cruz as a nominee. Indeed, while speaking at Stanford on Wednesday, former Speaker of the House John Boehner referred to Cruz as \u201dLucifer in the flesh,\u201d according to the Stanford Daily. He added: \u201dI have Democrat friends and Republican friends.",
        "By last January, people in Flint, Michigan, knew something was wrong with their water. It smelled and tasted bad. It was the color of rust. And they\u2019d already been told it was contaminated with chemicals that can cause cancer. Publicly, the state insisted all this was nothing to worry about. Privately, they made sure their own employees wouldn\u2019t have to drink Flint\u2019s water.",
        "Open a newspaper, watch the news, or turn on a presidential debate, and it can seem like Dementors have been placed in charge of writing the world\u2019s headlines. Syria is a charnel house. Afghanistan is in such bad shape that US troops may be bogged down there for decades to come. China\u2019s economy may be faltering. It\u2019s easy to get the impression that the world is not only terrible but also in the midst of an uninterrupted slide toward being even worse.",
        "Last year, Houston took a stab at doing something that sounds too good to be true \u2014 drastically improving its mass transit system by redoing the way its bus routes work, without spending a dime of extra money. Early results are now in, and it appears to be working. Bus ridership is up 4 percent on local routes and up 6 percent on routes \u2014 even as the city adds two new light rail lines (this part, obviously, did cost money) and ridership surges on the existing light rail red line.",
        "In nearly every interview they\u2019ve given since the launch of their Netflix true crime sensation Making a Murderer, directors Moira Demos and Laura Ricciardi have struck the same note. They didn\u2019t go into the project seeking to exonerate Steven Avery, they say. They have no opinion as to whether or not he killed Teresa Halbach, they say. Their aim is to highlight problems with the US legal system that should give pause even to those who come away from the documentary believing Avery really did commit the crime for which he is currently imprisoned, they say.",
        "Since I started working at Vox, I have come to realize that many of my colleagues believe a particular lie, one they have either been told or convinced themselves of. This lie is that the \u201dGreat Plains\u201d states \u2014 the Dakotas, Nebraska, and Kansas \u2014 are not in the Midwest, but instead comprise their own geographical region. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am from South Dakota, and I have discussed this matter with a colleague from Kansas. We have always believed ourselves to be from the Midwest.",
        "If your neighbor told you that the Saudi royal family had wired $681 million to his personal bank account and that they expected nothing in return, you\u2019d probably conclude that was not the full story and be left a bit baffled. This is something like what Malaysians are going through now, after revelations that Saudi royals wired Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak $681 million \u2014 with Najib citing the Saudi \u201ddonation\u201d as part of his defense in a corruption inquiry. Sure enough, on Tuesday morning Malaysia\u2019s attorney general cleared Najib of any wrongdoing in accepting the funds.",
        "The Iowa caucus Monday probably won\u2019t tell us who will win either party\u2019s nomination. But after a crowded primary season, especially for Republicans, the caucus will help us figure out who doesn\u2019t have a serious chance. In other words, we\u2019ll see who does really badly in Iowa \u2014 and who might not stand a chance in the rest of the election cycle. Only one eventual presidential nominee has finished worse than third in the Iowa caucus since 1972, when it became the kickoff event to the primary season.",
        "First things first: This isn\u2019t an explainer, because there is very little use in trying to explain the man wrapped in an enigma wrapped in a $3, 250 jacket that is Kanye West. But as Kanye gears up to release Waves, his eighth studio album (formerly known as Swish) he\u2019s been causing a stir on Twitter by teasing his upcoming album in ways both inscrutable and deliberately provocative. This is not album of the year. This is album of the life.",
        "On Thursday, Donald Trump got into a Twitter fight with an actual Saudi prince, Alwaleed bin Talal. This is not a drill. Here is the story of that fight \u2014 which grew, in its most recent manifestation, out of Trump\u2019s ongoing feud with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly and his decision to skip the Fox News debate on Thursday, but actually has a longer history. Yes, the fight was on Twitter Thursday morning, Donald Trump retweeted a meme from one of his supporters attacking Fox News for having ties to Saudi Arabia.",
        "The saga of Hillary Clinton and her emails took an unusual turn on Friday: the State Department announced it is withholding 22 emails because they contain information marked \u201dtop secret.\u201d And Clinton\u2019s campaign immediately objected, putting out a statement demanding that the emails be released. So what is going on here? Why are these emails top secret, why is it a big deal, and why would Clinton, of all people, want them released? It\u2019s impossible to know the answers to those questions with absolute certainty without seeing the emails.",
        "The first bill President Obama ever signed was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act \u2014 a basic but crucial protection for women who have been paid less than their male colleagues for years but didn\u2019t know it. Seven years later, Obama knows better than to expect this Congress to advance women\u2019s equality, so he\u2019s continuing to do what he can through executive orders and federal agencies. On Friday he announced that the government is going to start collecting data on employee demographics and salaries from all large employers, not just federal contractors."
