        "This episode of The Weeds tackles some of the pressing questions that keep nerds like us up at night. Like whether taxing the rich will hurt economic growth \u2014 and if there\u2019s space in the American political system for a third party. The answers, as always, are complex \u2014 but instead of a restless night of wondering alone, now you can join us on the podcast. Also in this week\u2019s edition: A new working paper shows a surprising way to increase high school attendance.",
        "Even compared with the anarchic circuses that were the previous Republican presidential debates this election season, Thursday night\u2019s installment in Des Moines was a doozy. It was preceded by very public waffling by frontrunner Donald Trump, who threatened to skip and have his own event elsewhere in Des Moines because Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly hurt his feelings at the first debate in August.",
        "Welcome to Dear Julia, a column where readers submit everyday health questions. Which painkillers work best? Is it better to run or walk for exercise? Julia Belluz sifts through the research and consults with experts in the field to figure out how science can help us live happier and healthier lives. Dear Julia: I have a trip planned to Brazil. Should I cancel because of Zika virus? There\u2019s a lot of panic right now about the Zika virus \u2014 and it seems understandable. For starters, this outbreak is different from, say, the Ebola scare that started two years ago.",
        "As the old saying goes, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. There\u2019s just one problem: Despite our demographic diversity, not everyone\u2019s beauty gets equal representation. However, new changes to one of the world\u2019s most iconic (and influential) dolls are set to address this. Time magazine reported that the 2016 Barbie Fashionista collection will come in three new body types. Now kids and adults alike will be able to play with \u201dtall,\u201d \u201dpetite,\u201d and \u201dcurvy\u201d Barbie dolls. The new line also includes a wider range of skin tones, hairstyles, and eye colors.",
        "Like this video? Subscribe to Vox on YouTube. Earlier this month, scientists moved quickly to halt the import of 201 species of salamanders to the US. A fungus that affects salamanders, called Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, or Bsal for short, has infiltrated biodiverse ecosystems across the world, and the US could be next. Bsal is believed to have originated in Asia, and while salamanders like the Japanese newt have built up an immunity to it over thousands of years, salamanders in the US are not immune and are at a huge risk.",
        "Trump stumps Fox; why Obama wants companies to tell the government how much they pay people; hypocrisy in Flint. Vox Sentences is written by Dylan Matthews and Dara Lind. TOP NEWS Trump 1, Fox News 0, Cruz Scott Images Donald Trump did not attend last night\u2019s Republican debate. Donald Trump won last night\u2019s Republican debate. [NBC News Chuck Todd, Mark Murray, and Carrie Dann] This isn\u2019t as dumb as it sounds. Ted Cruz, Trump\u2019s main competition in Iowa, had a terrible performance, making Trump\u2019s life easier.",
        "Before Anti, Rihanna\u2019s music was best listened to while raucously pregaming, glaring past lesser mortals, and dancing your face off at the sweatiest part of the night until you shut the party down. Rating 4 But with Anti \u2014 her first full album since 2012\u2019s Unapologetic \u2014 Rihanna sets the scene for the more intimate afterparty. This is an album for those straggling, happy drunks who stay an hour later than everyone else, winding around the empty dance floor with a bottle in hand . .. and then accidentally on purpose slide into bed together.",
        "Marvel\u2019s billionaire CEO Isaac \u201dIke\u201d Perlmutter sounds like a character straight from the company\u2019s comic books. He rarely appears in photos. The stories about the way he once cut budgets at Marvel have become urban legends (see: the allegation that Marvel headquarters only has one bathroom per gender). He reportedly has a concealed carry permit and plays tennis.",
        "Donald Trump didn\u2019t even need to attend Thursday night\u2019s Fox News debate \u2014 the numbers make clear that the businessman had already said his piece. When you tally up all seven Republican debates, you see that Trump has spoken more than any other candidate than Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) despite the fact that he didn\u2019t show up for Thursday\u2019s event. Trump wasn\u2019t onstage, but he was still a big presence Though he wasn\u2019t there, Trump was still on people\u2019s minds: He was the candidate Thursday night.",
        "The Iowa poll the political world has been eagerly awaiting is finally here \u2014 and it has great news for Donald Trump. On Saturday evening, Bloomberg Politics and the Des Moines Register released the results of their final Iowa caucus poll, which is conducted by widely respected pollster Ann Selzer and has been extremely accurate in recent years. For the Republican race, the poll found Trump in first among likely with 28 percent, Ted Cruz in second with 23 percent, and Marco Rubio in third with 15 percent.",
        "On Tuesday, New Hampshire voters will exercise their quadrennial right to shape both parties\u2019 presidential contests. If, as expected, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders post big wins, they\u2019ll gain huge momentum going into further contexts, and improve their ultimate odds of victory substantially. I should like this system. I grew up in New Hampshire, and the primary is great. For political dorks, it\u2019s a truly wonderful season (be sure to check out the kiosk at the Manchester Airport; last time I checked it had a great Lugar \u201996 pin).",
        "Amazon shares plummeted late last week as the company\u2019s quarterly earnings report revealed profits that were well below Wall Street\u2019s expectations. Notably, it\u2019s not as if people stopped buying things through Amazon. Sales grew 22 percent. It\u2019s just that analysts had gotten it into their heads that profit margins were going to rise as well. Loyal Vox readers, of course, were warned that this wouldn\u2019t happen, but some people don\u2019t listen.",
        "By now, 543 humans have spent time orbiting the Earth. But almost no one has stayed up as long as NASA astronaut Scott Kelly. Since March of 2015, Kelly has been living on the International Space Station as part of the One Year Mission. He and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko spent nearly a year in orbit to see how the human body copes with extended periods of microgravity \u2014 research that could help agencies prepare for future missions to Mars. (Kelly\u2019s identical twin brother, Mark, is staying on Earth as a control.) It\u2019s a grueling task.",
        "Humanity has conquered the world. It\u2019s hard to appreciate what that means, but the video above, by WorldPopulationHistory. org, shows just how incredible the growth and expansion of humanity has been over the past 2, 000 years. Here are some of the notable moments in the video: The map begins at 1:18, showing human population a little more than 2, 000 years ago, with each yellow dot representing 1 million people in an area. At this point, there are 170 million people on Earth.",
        "Primary voters going to the polls starting next week face the prospect of voting for candidates who have been unseen in the past 35 years of presidential politics: Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. But even if Trump and Sanders are denied the White House, their campaigns will have been extremely significant, perhaps even changing presidential politics forever. Their success in building a following in their parties is an early warning sign of discontent with the outlook that has dominated American politics for decades.",
        "It may be 2016, but sexism is still rampant in many areas of life: in Hollywood, in academia, in toy aisles, and, of course, on Twitter. One place you might not expect to find it? The dictionary. Recently, an anthropologist named Michael noticed some decidedly sexist language lurking in the example sentences for several Oxford Dictionaries entries \u2014 entries for common words that don\u2019t have anything to do with gender, like rabid (\u201da rabid feminist\u201d) shrill (\u201dthe rising shrill of women\u2019s voices\u201d) and psyche (\u201dI will never really fathom the female psyche\u201d).",
        "As Donald Trump continues his dominance of the national polls, with early primaries just days away, the has become all too thinkable: Could Trump actually pull this off? Could he become president? I\u2019m going to stake out a firm answer: no. Absent extreme and unlikely circumstances* Trump will never be president. Jack Shafer argues that Trump\u2019s success so far is a \u201dblack swan\u201d event, an unpredictable and unrepeatable concatenation of improbable circumstances. That sounds about right. But just because some political rules and conventions have been violated doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve all vanished.",
        "It\u2019s been impossible to ignore Amy Schumer\u2019s controversy. It doesn\u2019t matter that the three female comedians who accused her of plagiarism have recanted their claims, nor does it matter that Schumer has even offered to submit to (and film!) a polygraph test. The scandal isn\u2019t going away. Whether you believe Schumer or think she\u2019s a comedian Marc Maron\u2019s defense of Schumer is worth listening to. On the January 25 episode of his WTF podcast (episode #675) Maron took a few minutes to address what he believes were inane accusations against Schumer. \u201dIt\u2019s a who gives a fuck?",
        "Originally published on Ensia. On a Wednesday in late February 2010, hosted an unusual training session at its offices in Fort Collins, Colorado. The technology company had decided to eliminate polyvinyl chloride, or PVC \u2014 a type of plastic that releases harmful chemicals during production and when burned after disposal \u2014 from its power cords. But it realized that to get PVC out of its products, it was going to have to get its suppliers to do so too.",
        "Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced Thursday that the Pentagon is going to make some significant changes to its family policies. The military will increase maternity and paternity leave, extend military child care center hours, and start a pilot program allowing service members to freeze their sperm or eggs for later use so combat injuries won\u2019t interfere with their ability to start a family.",
        "Politicians often ask for your vote on Election Day. They don\u2019t often ask you to give it to one of their rivals. But that may be exactly what Hillary Clinton\u2019s team will ask of its supporters in the Iowa caucuses on Monday night. Due to the primary\u2019s confusing delegate math, Clinton backers may be asked to break from their preferred candidate and strategically vote for former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, who has been struggling to gain traction in the race, according to multiple reports.",
        "Over the weekend, Iowans began reporting receiving strange mailers from Ted Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign. The mailings didn\u2019t include any arguments for Cruz\u2019s candidacy or attacks on his opponents. Instead, they included the recipient\u2019s personal voting \u201dscore\u201d (a percentage from 0 to 100) and \u201dgrade\u201d (from A to F) as well as those for their neighbors. The yellow notices included a big red bar on top reading, \u201dVOTING VIOLATION\u201d: @RBPundit pic. twitter.",
        "Up until recently, Zika was a virus mostly confined to small islands in the Pacific Ocean and a few African nations. So how did it come to spark an \u201dexplosive\u201d world health emergency, infecting more than 1 million Brazilians and many more throughout the Americas? While health experts are unsure of the exact route Zika took, one hypothesis is that it arrived in Brazil during the 2014 World Cup. The idea is that an infected traveler or athlete came to Brazil, along with thousands of others, for the World Cup in 2014.",
        "In 2015, a CNN segment over a word turned into an awkward, dramatic confrontation. When host Erin Burnett asked why the word \u201dthug\u201d isn\u2019t an acceptable way to describe predominantly black protesters and rioters in Baltimore, City Councilman Carl Stokes responded, \u201dCome on. So calling them thugs? Just call them ni**ers.\u201d Burnett, who is white, didn\u2019t seem to understand the history that made the word offensive to black Americans. Stokes, who is black, reacted to Burnett\u2019s comments with a blunt description of how many black people interpret \u201dthug\u201d when it\u2019s lodged against them.",
        "Egypt\u2019s Interior Ministry admitted last week that at least 3, 462 university students are currently imprisoned in Egypt. As Middle East history professor Howard Eissenstat noted, that\u2019s more than the entire student body of some US colleges, including Vassar, Swarthmore, and Amherst. So why are an entire college\u2019s worth of students locked up in Egyptian prisons? It\u2019s all part of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah \u2019s expanding crackdown on dissent after the Arab Spring.",
        "The cover of Vanity Fair\u2019s annual \u201dHollywood\u201d issue is surrounded by a special kind of lore. Over the years, it\u2019s become both a representation of the film and television industry and a statement of where the industry is going. There\u2019s scrutiny over where certain actors appear in the multipage, foldout cover photo and the number of actors of color who are included, among other things. Last year, for example, the cover featured barely any nonwhite actors, a sign that Hollywood and Vanity Fair\u2019s definition of it had regressed.",
        "Yahoo is one of the brands on the internet, but its core internet business is in a grim situation. How grim? There\u2019s a debate over whether the company itself \u2014 what most of us think of when we think of Yahoo \u2014 is actually worth less than zero dollars. Back in 2005, Yahoo invested $1 billion in one of China\u2019s hottest technology startups, Alibaba, getting a roughly 40 percent stake. The bet has paid off handsomely. In 2012, Yahoo sold part of its stake back to Alibaba for $7. 6 billion.",
        "Almost every day, even if you don\u2019t own a car, you probably buy something made from oil. Usually we don\u2019t think about where that money goes \u2014 because the answer, at least some of the time, is that it ends up lining the pockets of some of the world\u2019s deadliest people. The problem, in fact, may be bigger than we think.",
        "Scientists in Britain just got approval to conduct research that involves editing the genetic material of healthy human embryos. This is a big deal: The UK\u2019s Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority is the first government agency in the world to endorse research that involves altering the human genome for research \u2014 a move that could signal broader acceptance for a promising (but controversial) new area of science. The research team, led by Dr. Kathy Niakan at the UK\u2019s Francis Crick Institute, is trying to better understand which genes allow a healthy human embryo to develop.",
        "For the final shot of Grease Live, the camera swooped around the cast and outside the soundstage to reveal an enormous carnival. In that moment, there was no denying the production\u2019s prowess. Director Thomas Kail (of Broadway\u2019s reigning champ, Hamilton) pulled off some incredibly tricky technical feats that would\u2019ve been impressive after editing, let alone a live performance. The cast \u2014 led by Julianne Hough as Sandy, Vanessa Hudgens as Rizzo, and Aaron Tveit as Danny \u2014 turned in solid performances, fueled by almost manic enthusiasm."
