        "February 2016 brings tales of love, treachery, and time travel to your favorite streaming services. And though it may be the shortest month of the year, it\u2019s positively packed with great new titles worth watching. Netflix adds the last seven episodes of one of the greatest TV shows ever made, and Amazon offers the best season yet of one of the few shows currently running with a claim to that title. Also, everywhere you look, everywhere you go, Fuller House is coming. Here are five top picks for each of the four top streaming services.",
        "On Monday, the Drug Enforcement Administration claimed to have busted a money laundering, scheme that linked the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah to major drug trafficking operations in Latin America.",
        "Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz\u2019s wins in Monday\u2019s Iowa caucuses were historic: Clinton was the first woman to ever win the Iowa caucus, and Cruz was the first Hispanic person to ever win any US presidential primary. Notably, had Bernie Sanders beat Clinton, he would have been the first Jewish person to win a presidential primary election. And Rubio, who placed third on the Republican side, is also Hispanic.",
        "Bernie Sanders\u2019s strong showing in Iowa \u2014 where he lost to Hillary Clinton by a hair \u2014 gives his supporters a lot to be excited about, including the overwhelming support of young voters and evidence that he is a viable candidate for the Democratic nomination. But experts say little in Sanders\u2019s performance Monday night suggested that he could beat Clinton to the ultimate nomination or that he is Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 general electoral coalition, said Matthew Dickinson, a political science professor at Middlebury College.",
        "The Zika virus was first discovered in the 1940s, though most people had never heard of it until this year. That\u2019s because for decades, Zika outbreaks were sporadic and tiny, and the disease seemed to do little harm. That changed in 2015. A massive outbreak in Brazil \u2014 which affected up to 1. 3 million people there in 2015 alone \u2014 has altered the scientific community\u2019s view of the virus.",
        "In 2014, America\u2019s opioid painkiller and heroin epidemic led to nearly 29, 000 opioid overdoses, causing nearly of the record 47, 000 drug overdoses that year. While there are already some measures in place to squash this rising epidemic, the Obama administration on Tuesday proposed a $1. 1 billion plan to boost the fight.",
        "For anyone who thought Congress might accomplish something in 2016, this dose of cold water comes from the Hill\u2019s Alexander Bolton, who reports that probably ain\u2019t happening: \u201dSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) seeking to protect his majority in a tough cycle for Republicans, is leaning toward holding back several measures that have bipartisan support but are divisive in his conference.\u201d So, for example, that bipartisan criminal justice reform bill that looked so promising, the one Republicans and Democrats had worked so hard on to reach a compromise. Yeah, the Senate won\u2019t be voting on that.",
        "A villainous pair of swans have been tormenting the good citizens of Brimscombe, a tiny village in the Cotswolds, with such viciousness that it\u2019s become national news. According to Metro UK, the two swans have vandalized property, harassed vehicles on public thoroughfares, and even attacked children. Local residents, Metro reports, have been forced to go about armed with water pistols because the authorities refuse to step in. Swans, local officials inform the fearful residents, are \u201dprotected animals.\u201d Protected indeed: Swans are able to act with impunity because they enjoy official royal protection. Really.",
        "Why would someone in the United States ever take up the cause of violent jihadism to attack his or her fellow citizens? It\u2019s a question Americans seem to be asking more lately after San Bernardino, the Boston Marathon bombing, and Fort Hood. America\u2019s problem with homegrown jihadism is relatively quite small, but it\u2019s not nothing, either. Where does it come from, how much of a threat is it, and what can or should be done about it? Peter Bergen\u2019s new book United States of Jihad tries to answer these questions.",
        "The O. J. Simpson murder trial was a circus; most of us would agree that much is true. An unending barrage of oddities, it left America with a hangover and a bad taste in its mouth, to the degree that the trial mostly disappeared from pop culture after it concluded in 1995. (There was one CBS miniseries dramatization in 2000, but nobody watched.) Rating 4.",
        "Over the past few weeks, the Hollywood diversity debate has gone from national conversation to direct action. And now a New York Times reporter has proposed a new measurement, the \u201dDuVernay test,\u201d to see just how well those actions hold up to the cause for inclusion.",
        "Punxsutawney Phil, the famous groundhog meteorologist of central Pennsylvania, saw his shadow this morning \u2014 so, according to legend, 2017 will bring more winter weather. But if you were enjoying those January days that felt like spring, take heart. Phil isn\u2019t a particularly accurate meteorologist, according to an analysis from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which tracks climate data in the US. The last time Phil successfully predicted the weather was 2014, when he saw his shadow and both February and March had temperatures. Before that, the last successful prediction was in 1999.",
        "Decoding the caucus results from both parties; Alphabet (formerly known as Google) topples Apple for world\u2019s most valuable company. Vox Sentences is written by Dylan Matthews and Dara Lind. TOP NEWS Christopher Images Ted Cruz won the 2016 Iowa Republican caucus last night, confounding polling that showed him coming in second to Trump. [Vox Libby Nelson] Trump underperformed a little, but Cruz overperformed a lot \u2014 thanks to a relatively focus on field organization and turnout, and relatively tactics of microtargeting. (Sasha Issenberg explains in detail.) [Bloomberg Sasha Issenberg] Trump\u2019s concession speech was \u2026 classy. Almost \u2026 too classy.",
        "Yes, we promised you a podcast about the weeds of policy. And, yes, on this rare occasion that is the week of the Iowa caucuses \u2014 the week the 2016 election season begins in full force \u2014 we are breaking that promise. Or at least sort of! This week\u2019s episode of The Weeds looks at Iowa through the lens of a policy nerd, examining what it says about the strength of both political parties and what that portends for the election season to come.",
        "When Rick Santorum ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, he won 11 states and nearly 4 million votes. This time around, the former Pennsylvania senator never seriously threatened to have an impact on the race. CNN is now reporting that Santorum will end his campaign after receiving just 1 percent of the vote in Iowa \u2014 a state he won in 2012.",
        "The lead poisoning crisis in Flint, Michigan, was a surprise, an emergency that occurred after the city switched to a new, cheaper water source. But there are at least six cities in the United States where we should, in theory, have really good data on lead exposure. In fiscal year 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spent almost $2 million as part of a funding commitment to help some of the biggest cities in the country monitor lead exposure. I spent the past week looking at these cities, and came away with three main findings.",
        "Hillary Clinton is ready to go it alone. Rather than waiting for Congress if she\u2019s elected president, she\u2019s promised to unilaterally enact stricter gun control measures, tighten financial regulations, and shield more immigrants from deportation. Clinton\u2019s promise to expand presidential powers in office has been largely seen as a political \u2014 a rallying cry for the base that risks antagonizing only those who would vote against her anyway. The prevailing consensus is that Americans will support the power grabs of the presidents they already support and disapprove power grabs when they already disapprove of the president.",
        "In the hallowed halls where America\u2019s conventional wisdom is made, from the media to think tanks to academia, from those on the left to those on the right, there is a point of consensus on the Democratic presidential primary so widely and deeply held that it is rarely, if ever, questioned: Hillary Clinton is the serious foreign policy candidate, whereas Bernie Sanders has neither interest in nor any apparent aptitude for one of the more important roles he would play as president.",
        "The World Health Organization has just declared the Zika virus to be a public health emergency. There\u2019s good reason to believe that Zika causes a severe birth defect called microcephaly, which is associated with abnormally small heads, underdeveloped brains, and reduced life expectancy. As rates of Zika infections have skyrocketed in Latin American countries, so have reports of these birth defects. This is a terrifying prospect for pregnant women.",
        "The government has a message for women: If you\u2019re not using birth control, you shouldn\u2019t be drinking. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a new report, warns that women who aren\u2019t using contraception and who are consuming alcohol are taking unacceptable risks. It estimates 3. 3 million women in the US could be endangering the health of a potential child by having unprotected sex and continuing to drink. Drinking while pregnant can cause children to be born with physical and mental disabilities, sometimes severe ones. The CDC\u2019s guidance is trying to prevent that.",
        "Texas has long been at the forefront of the battle to defund Planned Parenthood. In 2013, the state successfully cut the network of clinics out of its public family planning program for women. Related Stat check: no, women couldn\u2019t just \u201dgo somewhere else\u201d if Planned Parenthood were defunded Now researchers at the University of Texas have figured out what happened next: Fewer women filled birth control prescriptions \u2014 and more women had babies.",
        "One would think the results of the Iowa caucuses would be simple. Ted Cruz won the Republican side, and Hillary Clinton won the Democratic one. So they\u2019re Monday night\u2019s winners, right? Wrong. The way the media and party leaders interpret the primaries isn\u2019t by who won \u2014 but by who exceeded expectations. So in a night when Clinton and Bernie Sanders came close, and both Cruz and finisher Marco Rubio exceeded expectations, who really wins? The Daily Show tried to explain.",
        "Southern California Gas Co. the owner of a natural gas storage facility that\u2019s been spewing methane and other noxious gases since late October, is now facing criminal charges. Los Angeles County prosecutors have charged the utility with three misdemeanor counts for each day it allegedly failed to alert authorities to the leak after it had been discovered, as well as a fourth misdemeanor count for the leak itself. The utility could be fined $25, 000 for each day it failed to report the leak, plus $1, 000 for each day the leak has continued.",
        "MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe on Wednesday featured a discussion of Hillary Clinton\u2019s tone, which you can watch in full here. \u201dShe shouts,\u201d journalist Bob Woodward said of Clinton. \u201dThere is something unrelaxed about the way she is communicating, and I think that just jumps off the television screen.\u201d That kicked off an train wreck of a conversation that used Clinton\u2019s alleged problems with volume to support arguments about how voters find her untrustworthy \u2014 and even to suggest that Clinton doesn\u2019t know or trust herself as a person.",
        "One of the biggest hurdles to promoting diversity in Hollywood is figuring out how to improve diversity behind the camera. Having more diverse writers and directors will lead to more diverse stories being told, which will lead to more consistent work for women, people of color, and LGBTQ people across the board \u2014 or so the theory goes. Most public pressure when it comes to Hollywood diversity, however, focuses on faces in front of the camera, because those are the people moviegoers and TV fans actually see.",
        "Things have not been going so well for Jeb Bush. He squandered his standing in national polls and failed to capitalize at all on his huge name recognition advantage relative to the likes of Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. His Super PAC spent more than $14 million on ads in Iowa to garner 2. 8 percent of the vote and sixth place, at a total cost of $2, 800 per vote.",
        "Update: This article, which originally ran on Thursday after Rubio\u2019s initial comments, has been updated to include his discussion of the issue in Saturday\u2019s debate. Republican presidential candidates are naturally running on a platform of challenging the Obama administration and its policies, and this leads them to criticize things the president does. No surprise. That\u2019s how politics works. When President Obama gave a speech on Wednesday at a Baltimore mosque to discuss inclusion and Islamophobia, then, it wasn\u2019t exactly shocking that some Republican candidates looked for a way to criticize it.",
        "Bernie Sanders\u2019s health care plan is a nonstarter in Congress. But so is the paid parental leave and tax hikes on the rich that both he and Hillary Clinton support. So are the various gun control ideas they argue about. From a distance, it can look like Sanders and Clinton are essentially squabbling over total hypotheticals, with him offering utopian schemes that can\u2019t possibly happen and her offering somewhat less utopian schemes that also can\u2019t happen.",
        "Journalists and pundits who write about Bernie Sanders or his policies have learned to be very careful. At this point, it\u2019s pretty much a given that almost anything critical of Bernie Sanders or his supporters will lead to backlash, and perhaps even personal attacks. It is definitely a real thing that happens. But how common it is, how unique it is to Sanders supporters, and how much of a problem it is for Sanders\u2019s campaign, his supporters, or American democracy \u2014 these are all open questions. They\u2019re questions that deserve to be discussed in the open.",
        "Ever since health officials hit the panic button on Zika \u2014 the virus that may be causing terrible birth defects in Latin America \u2014 we\u2019ve seen story after breathless story about how we\u2019ll soon be able to use genetic engineering to crush the mosquito menace and halt this disease. There\u2019s so much excitement around this possibility, in fact, that some media outlets have already moved on to debating whether we should use our newfound powers to squelch every last mosquito on the planet."
