        "It\u2019s the last year of President Obama\u2019s presidency. He doesn\u2019t have to stand for reelection. Congress isn\u2019t going to pass any of his proposals anyway. So he may as well dream big. That\u2019s one way to read this proposal in Obama\u2019s final budget: He\u2019s suggesting that Congress slap a $10. tax on oil, phased in over five years, in order to fund $319 billion worth of investments in \u201dclean transportation\u201d over the next decade. That would mean massively increased spending on mass transit, rail, cars, freight upgrades, and so on. The budget proposal starts on p. 19 here.",
        "For most of the past five years, Apple has been the world\u2019s most valuable company, with oil giant ExxonMobil a close second and other companies far behind. But recently, Apple\u2019s earnings growth has slowed, while Alphabet \u2014 the company most of us know as Google \u2014 has seen its profits continue to grow. The result: Alphabet briefly passed Apple on Thursday to become the world\u2019s most valuable company \u2014 though it ended the day worth $488. 7 billion, slightly less than Apple\u2019s $489. 9 billion.",
        "Pharmaceutical company enfant terrible Martin Shkreli is being dragged before a congressional hearing today to talk about the skyrocketing price of drugs. Shkreli, the former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, became a symbol of the problem when he famously raised the price of an old drug used to treat AIDS patients by 5, 000 percent, from $13. 50 per tablet to $750. His reasoning: pure profit. \u201dAlthough Mr.",
        "Kids aren\u2019t supposed to drink alcohol. But in the US, booze is everywhere. It\u2019s hard to grow up without being exposed to alcohol advertising. And those ads are working a little too well: Several studies have found that higher exposure to alcohol ads correlates with an increase in drinking among youth. That\u2019s a big problem: Drinking at a young age, according to numerous studies, can lead to detrimental effects, from dependence to earlier development of liver cirrhosis. That\u2019s why the alcohol industry takes steps to stop ads from reaching people under 21.",
        "There\u2019s been no shortage of talk this election about Hillary Clinton\u2019s ties to Wall Street or the fact her campaign has received $21. 4 million from the financial services sector. So it was surprising when, on Wednesday, Clinton seemed like she\u2019d been caught off guard when asked during a CNN Democratic town hall why she had accepted $675, 000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. Here\u2019s the exchange between Clinton and the host, Anderson Cooper: Cooper: \u201dYou were paid $675, 000 for three speeches (to Goldman). Was that a mistake?",
        "Chances are you\u2019re a friend of a friend of a friend of Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 at least according to Facebook. A theory holds that most people, at least in the US and perhaps in the world, are six degrees of separation away from each other. Pick a random stranger anywhere in the country, the theory goes, and chances are you can build a chain of acquaintances between the two of you in no more than six hops. The idea of \u201dsix degrees of separation\u201d rests on a scientific foundation that\u2019s dubious at best.",
        "Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders squared off at a Democratic debate on Thursday night, a few days before voters in New Hampshire decide the winner of the second primary contest. The debate began with the candidates arguing over the label \u201dprogressive\u201d before moving on to discuss investment banking, campaign finance, foreign policy, and a host of other issues. The candidates exchanged heated remarks in what is regarded as an increasingly tight race. Below are transcriptions of seven of the key exchanges between Clinton and Sanders from the debate on Thursday night.",
        "Every February, schools, businesses, and governments across the country pay homage to black Americans like Harriet Tubman and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to mark Black History Month. While some of the biggest names in history are touted during this month, the reason we even celebrate it today goes back to the idea of trumpeting those whose achievements had gone unsung. And back then, Black History Month was just a week. Historian Carter G.",
        "From an evolutionary perspective, it makes no sense whatsoever that music makes us feel emotions. Why would our ancestors have cared about music? Despite many who\u2019d argue the contrary, it\u2019s not necessary for survival. \u201dC or is very rarely a matter of life and death,\u201d says Aucouturier, a neuroscientist who researches music and emotion at the French Institute of Science in Paris.",
        "Bernie Sanders has gone from candidate to a real contender for the Democratic nomination for president. Were Democrats to make the \u201ddemocratic socialist\u201d from Vermont their nominee, would he have a chance of winning a general election? We posed that question to six of the country\u2019s top political scientists, and their answers were broadly consistent: Under some unlikely circumstances, Sanders could win a general election. But nominating him would make it significantly more difficult for Democrats to keep the White House.",
        "This week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention came out with a new campaign advising all sexually active women of childbearing age who aren\u2019t using contraception to avoid alcohol. The logic here, apparently, is that these women might get pregnant, and any amount of alcohol could damage the fetus. \u201dThe risk is real,\u201d Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC, said in a statement. \u201dWhy take the chance?\u201d The backlash was swift. Critics called the advice puritanical, paternalistic, and overly cautious.",
        "The fifth 2016 Democratic presidential primary debate marked the first time Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton faced each other one on one. The February 4 debate was also the first one after the Iowa caucuses, which saw Sanders and Clinton fight to a draw, and the last before the New Hampshire primary, where Sanders is expected to beat Clinton handily. It finds Clinton at perhaps her weakest moment in the campaign so far, with no clear victories to date, defeat imminent, and a growing and impassioned movement backing her opponent.",
        "What do we talk about when we talk about \u201dBernie Bros\u201d? Officially, the term \u201dBernie Bro\u201d first came to prominence in an October 2015 Atlantic article by Robinson Meyer that poked fun at a certain type of Bernie Sanders supporter: young, male, and earnest. But soon the term started to shift in meaning, and became a way to discuss young male Sanders supporters who were a little too, shall we say, when it came to women.",
        "How did America get to a point where legal opioid painkillers, marketed as medicine, were involved in nearly 19, 000 overdose deaths in 2014? One alarming explanation: The drug companies behind these opioids wanted more people to buy their product, so they led a misleading campaign to get doctors to prescribe their drugs. The result: Drug companies profited as more and more people got addicted and died of overdoses. This chart, from a 2015 study published in the Annual Review of Public Health, tells the story: Let\u2019s back up.",
        "The US unemployment rate fell to 4. 9 percent in January, the Labor Department reported on Friday. It\u2019s the first time the unemployment rate has fallen below 5 percent since the 2008 financial crisis. The same report shows that there were 151, 000 new jobs created in January. That\u2019s a bit of a slowdown \u2014 in 2015, the economy created approximately 225, 000 new jobs, on average, per month. These mixed results suggest that the economy is doing relatively well but could be doing even better. Another sign of this is wage growth.",
        "Hail, Caesar! is a big, Looney Tunes confection of a movie. It\u2019s like one of those animated shorts where Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd find themselves running around a studio backlot and proceed to adopt the conventions of different movie genres, depending on the costumes and sets they\u2019re surrounded by. Rating 4 In other words, it\u2019s fundamentally very silly. But at its core, it\u2019s also a story about change and impermanence, and the way that theoretically perfect systems are worn down by the fact that human beings are always, always imperfect.",
        "The internet caught on fire this week with reports that the infamous \u201dpickup artist\u201d Daryush Valizadeh, known as Roosh V, was going to hold \u201d rallies\u201d around the world in 165 cities and 43 countries on February 6. Women\u2019s rights advocates, members of Anonymous, and even a women\u2019s boxing club in Toronto quickly started organizing . Police were on alert. Tens of thousands of people in the United Kingdom, Scotland, and Australia signed petitions to keep Roosh and his \u201dhate speech\u201d out of their country.",
        "Marco Rubio had a very bad night at the Republican debate on Saturday. And no video makes it clearer than the one above, showing Rubio repeating the exact same line over and over again \u2014 even after he was criticized for it by Chris Christie. The context is important here: Early in the debate, Christie mocked Rubio for relying so much on his stump speech at the debate.",
        "The Republican debate Saturday night started with a traffic jam. After ABC\u2019s moderators called Chris Christie to the stage, they called Ben Carson. But Carson missed the cue and stayed in the wings even as the camera panned to him, and Sen. Ted Cruz walked past. Backstage, someone waved frantically at Carson, urging him to the stage, but he stayed put, smiling with equanimity. Carson started a . The moderators called Donald Trump\u2019s name, and then called Marco Rubio before Trump had made it to the stage.",
        "Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz joked about Republicans having a debate on Super Bowl weekend \u2014 in a thinly veiled attack against those who have criticized the Democratic leadership for scheduling debates on weekends to limit viewership and, in effect, protect Hillary Clinton from making a widely televised blunder. Hmmm, wondering why @GOP trying to hide their #GOPdebate on the Saturday of #SuperBowl weekend no less?! \u2014 D Wasserman Schultz (@DWStweets) February 6, 2016 Wasserman Schultz later clarified she was only pointing out that both parties schedule debates on weekends, and there\u2019s nothing nefarious about it. .",
        "The next Republican presidential debate is tonight in Manchester, New Hampshire, and will air on ABC. The network has said that coverage of the debate will begin at 8 pm Eastern, though it is not clear if the debate will begin right then or a bit afterward. You\u2019ll be able to view a live stream online at ABCNews. go. com. After skipping out on the last GOP debate \u2014 and losing the Iowa caucuses \u2014 Donald Trump has announced that he will show up this time.",
        "The eighth Republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign \u2014 and the last one before the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday \u2014 began with a slapstick offstage candidate and generally devolved from there. Donald Trump referred to the live debate audience as \u201ddonors and special interests\u201d backing Jeb Bush. John Kasich thanked the audience for their \u201dpatience\u201d for seemingly no reason at all. And Marco Rubio appeared totally incapable of speaking extemporaneously rather than returning repeatedly to his script. We won\u2019t know who \u201dreally\u201d won until poll results trickle in.",
        "Bernie Sanders recently leveled a charge against Hillary Clinton: You can be a moderate. You can be a progressive. But you cannot be a moderate and a progressive. \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) February 3, 2016 He repeated the charge in Thursday night\u2019s debate, and it became the pivotal point of conflict throughout the night. The charge is false. But it\u2019s good that Sanders has made it, because it helps expose a key source of misunderstanding between the Clinton and Sanders camps.",
        "For most of this week, it seemed like the Iowa caucus results had finally imposed some order on the sprawling, chaotic Republican presidential contest. Sure, Ted Cruz and Donald Trump had finished first and second, but among the more candidates, it was Marco Rubio who was rising above the pack. It was suddenly easy to envision more mainstream GOP voters and the party\u2019s elites quickly falling behind Rubio, which would transform the race into a battle between him, Trump, and Cruz. That still might well happen. But Saturday\u2019s debate shows it\u2019s far from certain.",
        "The second Larry David was announced as the host of the February 6 edition of Saturday Night Live, it became obvious that the show was going to offer an extended take on Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign. David, see, has played Sanders on previous occasions, and his initial appearance as the candidate was one of this season\u2019s true delights \u2014 even if most of the jokes SNL wrote for him were of the generic \u201dold man\u201d variety. His second appearance might have been even sharper, but he was overshadowed by that night\u2019s host \u2014 one Donald Trump.",
        "I didn\u2019t watch last night\u2019s Republican debate, and catching up on it the day after, Rubio\u2019s programming glitch \u2014 in which he responded to allegations of robotically repeating talking points by robotically repeating his talking points \u2014 certainly struck me as funny: But was it bad in the kind of way that people would actually care about? David Frum, one of the smartest conservative pundits around, made the case that it was that bad in a series of tweets that are very much worth your time.",
        "STRATHAM, NH \u2014 Last Saturday\u2019s debate may have left you with the impression that Marco Rubio is an overly scripted robot. But two days earlier in New Hampshire, I saw something quite different \u2014 a skilled, eloquent, and talented political performer who could expertly modify his message depending on whom he was addressing. One version of Rubio fired up the conservative base at a town hall in Manchester on Thursday afternoon \u2014 repeatedly attacking President Obama, returning to conservative issues like Obamacare and sanctuary cities, and laying out how he thought his party could best defeat the Democrats.",
        "This Tuesday, the Obama administration will unveil its eighth and final budget proposal, its last comprehensive, detailed vision of how the federal government should look. The budget is a key indication of the administration\u2019s values and priorities. It\u2019s an expression of the mainstream of Democratic Party policy thinking on a wide range of topics, from to housing to unemployment. Even though it has virtually no chance of changing actual government policy, that role is important in and of itself. The wish list is expected to be relatively .",
        "One of the nagging questions of the Republican primary has been why the GOP establishment hasn\u2019t united behind Marco Rubio. The move seemed obvious \u2014 they feared Donald Trump, they loathed Ted Cruz, and Rubio seemed like a more serious threat to Hillary Clinton than Jeb Bush or Chris Christie. But it didn\u2019t happen. And it kept not happening. Even as Bush tanked and Christie struggled, Rubio got a few endorsements, but never the flood that would have signaled GOP elites were closing ranks; he raised some money, but nothing that approached Bush\u2019s early haul.",
        "The Zika virus hasn\u2019t yet done very much harm in the United States. But it\u2019s already freaking people out \u2014 and the Obama administration is now calling for a big response to halt its spread. On Monday, the White House said it would ask Congress for $1. 8 billion in emergency funding to combat the Zika virus, which has already infected more than 1 million people in South America and is thought, in some cases, to damage the brains of fetuses."
