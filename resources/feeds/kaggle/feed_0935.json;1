        "At the height of Ebola panic in 2014, some state governments used a draconian measure to keep the virus from spreading within their borders: mandatory quarantines for people returning from West Africa, where Ebola was circulating. The federal government said the measure wasn\u2019t necessary, and the health community unanimously agreed. Locking up travelers at random for 21 days \u2014 Ebola\u2019s incubation period \u2014 wouldn\u2019t actually stop the virus from moving. Still, some governors went ahead with the quarantines anyway. Perhaps the most vocal advocate was New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.",
        "Tim Geithner used to be Treasury secretary, and before that he was president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, and before that he was an undersecretary of Treasury in the Clinton administration. Today, regulatory filings reveal that he\u2019s obtained a personal line of credit from JPMorgan. He plans to use the money to invest in a $12 billion private equity fund that Warburg Pincus, where he works now, is raising.",
        "It\u2019s common knowledge at this point that the Republican Party, and Donald Trump especially, has been engaging in some pretty ugly rhetoric during this election cycle: obsessively harping on the importance of calling the enemy by its name, \u201dradical Islam,\u201d and supporting a temporary ban on all Muslims coming into the United States. The Democratic Party, therefore, has tried to present itself during this campaign as the more inclusive, party, in opposition to the GOP. And in many ways, it has succeeded. For instance, one of the speakers on the first night of the Democratic National Convention was Rep.",
        "Marco Rubio doesn\u2019t just repeat talking points during debates; it seems he also does it while delivering his stump speech. Not just by delivering the same speech over and over again (everyone does that) but in this case by delivering the exact same sentence \u2014 about how it\u2019s hard to raise kids in the 21st century with churchy values because nefarious forces in pop culture want to ram other values down our throats \u2014 twice in a row.",
        "Bernie Sanders has a simple explanation of why the US hasn\u2019t achieved universal health care yet: money. \u201dDo you know why we can\u2019t do what every other country \u2014 major country \u2014 on Earth is doing?\u201d he asked during the January 17 Democratic debate. \u201dIt\u2019s because we have a campaign finance system that is corrupt, we have Super PACs, we have the pharmaceutical industry pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into campaign contributions and lobbying, and the private insurance companies as well.\u201d Sanders is the most vocal exponent of this critique currently, but he\u2019s hardly the only one.",
        "The Supreme Court just put a kink in President Obama\u2019s climate change plans. How big a kink . .. well, that remains to be seen. In a surprise decision on Tuesday evening, the conservative justices halted implementation of the EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan \u2014 a major regulation aimed at cutting carbon dioxide emissions from US power plants. The hold will last until legal challenges to the rule are resolved. A little background here: The Obama administration finalized its Clean Power Plan last summer.",
        "If you thought Syria\u2019s civil war couldn\u2019t get any worse, unfortunately you would be wrong. In the past several weeks, Bashar \u2019s forces \u2014 backed by Iranian troops and Russian airpower \u2014 have seized the final supply line running into Aleppo, Syria\u2019s largest city, as part of its offensive in the country\u2019s north. About 400, 000 people live in areas of Aleppo, and they currently have no way to get more food or other necessities except for what the government lets through.",

Hey Beloved Pals, I just wanted to let you know that, while I am so excited for Girls to return on Feb 21, I won\u2019t be. .. Posted by Lena Dunham on Monday, February 8, 2016 \u201dAs many of you know I have endometriosis, a chronic condition that affects approximately 1 in 10 women\u2019s reproductive health,\u201d she wrote on Facebook this week.",
        "With ideological extremism on the rise in Congress, President Barack Obama argued during his State of the Union that America must reform its elections. \u201dIf we want a better politics, it\u2019s not enough to just change a congressman or a senator or even a president,\u201d Obama said. \u201dWe have to change the system to reflect our better selves.\u201d Obama was less clear on how, exactly, America might pull this off.",
        "The Weeds podcast has been so much fun (subscribe here!) that I\u2019m launching another podcast.

        "Loving a new Ryan Reynolds movie, and having that movie be Deadpool, feels like the inverse of a paper cut. It\u2019s like snuggling a chocolate chip cookie \u2014 scented golden retriever in a pillow fort at Chrissy Teigen and John Legend\u2019s house. Rating 4 The whole thing feels so damn nice and natural because it\u2019s been such a long time since Reynolds has done anything anyone cared about.",
        "Criminal justice reform in Congress was always a compromise \u2014 not just between Democrats and Republicans, but between legislators who believe the US needs to end mass incarceration and those who aren\u2019t so sure. The question was how far the bill\u2019s supporters could go in making compromises on compromises, to win over remaining skeptics, without giving in to the very myths that made mass incarceration so potent. The Senate\u2019s criminal justice reform bill \u2014 which passed out of committee last year, but was reintroduced with substantial changes on Thursday \u2014 has tipped over into the latter.",
        "In his final year at the White House, President Barack Obama is on a mission \u2026 to fix the White House\u2019s wifi. Yup, the White House, the home and workplace of the leader of the free world, has a bad wifi connection. \u201dThis is an old building, so there are a lot of dead spots where the wifi doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Obama said on CBS in a joint interview with Michelle Obama about their Sunday Super Bowl plans. The spotty connection is on his list of things to fix for the next president.",
        "The Union of Concerned Scientists has issued a new report that takes a look at three key transportation fuels: gasoline, biofuels, and electricity. It compares their greenhouse gas emissions, taking into account their full life cycle, from production to end use. And it looks at how those life cycle emissions are evolving over time. Here\u2019s the key graph: (These are all based on a car that gets 25 mpg or the equivalent, driving 12, 000 miles a year.) Like the graph says, gasoline is getting dirtier while biofuels and electricity are getting cleaner. Why is that?",
        "Chances are you don\u2019t need yet another television show to add to your slate, but if you can find it in your heart to make some room for a new crew of lovable weirdos, NBC\u2019s new sitcom Superstore is worth the squeeze. The comedy \u2014 which stars America Ferrera and Ben Feldman as dissatisfied employees of a retail store \u2014 has been quietly turning out one charming episode after another since it premiered in January.",
        "Unlike in her first shot at the presidency, Hillary Clinton has centered her second White House run on the allure of electing the nation\u2019s first woman president. It\u2019s a pitch she makes often, usually ending her speeches by conjuring an image of America in which \u201da father can tell his daughter, \u2018Yes, you can be anything you want to be, even president of the United States. \u2019\u201d It\u2019s an immensely popular line with Clinton\u2019s most ardent supporters \u2014 Democratic women in their 40s or older.",
        "For a few weeks in the summer, before it became clear that Donald Trump was here to stay, Carly Fiorina was the surprise rising star of the Republican primary. But by the fall, her star faded. Fiorina never did better than third place in the national polling average, and by January, she wasn\u2019t even on the main debate stage. After getting 4 percent of the vote in the New Hampshire primary and less than 2 percent in Iowa, Fiorina announced Wednesday she was dropping out of the race.",
        "Eventually, America\u2019s presidential primaries will end, and the world\u2019s most powerful country will turn to the general election. And when it does, polling suggests that foreign policy and terrorism will be major issues for voters. This will naturally focus much of our national discourse, over the following several months, on Syria. That\u2019s largely a good thing. Syria\u2019s civil war, which since its 2011 inception has become a proxy war involving much of the Middle East as well as the US and Russia, could use some attention.",
        "John McCain is very angry about the way the Republican race is going \u2014 on the specific issue of torturing detainees suspected of terrorism. \u201dIt\u2019s been so disappointing to see some presidential candidates engaged in loose talk on the campaign trail about reviving waterboarding and other inhumane interrogation techniques,\u201d McCain, who was himself tortured while he was held prisoner during the Vietnam War, said during a Tuesday Senate speech. \u201dOur enemies act without conscience. We must not.\u201d McCain has good reason to be angry.",
        "On Monday, Donald Trump held a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, where he merrily repeated a woman in the crowd who called Ted Cruz a pussy. hours later, Donald Trump won the New Hampshire primary in a landslide. I\u2019m not here to clutch my pearls over Trump\u2019s vulgarity; what was telling, rather, was the immaturity of the moment, the glee Trump took in his \u201dshe said it, I didn\u2019t\u201d game. The media, which has grown used to covering Trump as a sideshow, delighted in the moment along with him \u2014 it was funny, and it meant clicks, takes, traffic.",
        "Let\u2019s talk about the \u201dduck curve,\u201d shall we? Everyone who cares about solar energy should know about the duck curve. Plus, it\u2019s fun to say. Duck curve. Duck curve. The long story is below, but the short story is: The duck curve refers to the effect that solar power has on demand for utility electricity. For many, many decades, demand for electricity followed a fairly predictable daily course, allowing utility grid managers to become experts at predicting and satisfying it.",
        "couples in Georgia may now have the freedom to marry, but a pair of proposed religious exemption laws has many Georgians from all walks of life up in arms. About 150 people, with a coalition of organizations known as Georgia Unites Against Discrimination, rallied at the Georgia State Capitol Tuesday against religious exemptions bills up for debate. The problem, protesters argue, isn\u2019t so much that these laws are denying LGBTQ couples\u2019 marriage rights, but that the bills are too broad to protect them. Last Thursday, HB 757, or the \u201dPastor Protection Act,\u201d passed through the Georgia House Judiciary subcommittee.",
        "Party elites don\u2019t really matter, and endorsements are a terrible predictor of primary outcomes.   Retail politics isn\u2019t important, especially in New Hampshire.   Socialist is a winning affiliation in American politics.   Gaffes are incredibly important.  Super PACs don\u2019t matter.  Fundraising doesn\u2019t matter.  Democrats are highly ideological.  Republicans aren\u2019t ideological at all. Being a member of the political party whose nomination you\u2019re running for confers absolutely no advantage in winning said nomination.",
        "New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who hung his bid for the White House on his conservative governing record in an otherwise blue state, is expected to drop his bid to be the Republican\u2019s presidential nominee Wednesday, according to multiple reports. Christie fought hard to be the establishment choice in this election, but he was locked in a battle to capture that title. He had staked his strategy on winning \u2014 or placing top among establishment candidates \u2014 in New Hampshire, even securing the endorsement of the New Hampshire Union Leader. But Christie failed to capitalize on this success.",
        "Here\u2019s an alarming finding: A big, rising segment of the population has very little faith in a major American institution \u2014 the US justice system. A new YouGov survey finds that nearly half of millennials see the justice system as fundamentally unjust \u2014 much higher than older age groups: Not only that, but millennials, along with to are much less likely to trust the police than older Americans: \u201dThe only group with less trust in the police than are black Americans, 40% of whom say that they have \u2019no trust\u2019 in the police,\u201d YouGov found.",
        "Famed Atlantic writer Coates finally confessed to whom he\u2019s supporting in the Democratic primary. It seems the MacArthur Genius Grant recipient is feeling the Bern. \u201dI will be voting for Sen. Sanders,\u201d Coates told host Amy Goodman on Democracy Now. Coates said he was initially avoiding the question, hoping to separate his role as a writer from his views as a private citizen, but no longer saw value in staying neutral. He said his son, who was present for the interview, convinced him to reach that point. But that said, I\u2019m not \u201dendorsing\u201d anyone.",

        "The war of feminist hot takes captures perfectly the state of the generational divide among liberal women.

        "About 1. 3 billion years ago, two black holes in a remote part of the universe collided with one another. The two objects were so massive that the interaction of their gravities distorted the space and time around them. If you could witness the event up close, it would be like living in a funhouse mirror. One hundred years ago, Albert Einstein predicted that the distortion of spacetime caused by such a collision wouldn\u2019t stop at the site of the collision. Like a ripple on a pond, it would propagate outward in gravitational waves.",
        "A crime law is once again making news. At a rally on Thursday, Bill Clinton confronted Black Lives Matter protesters who blamed the 1994 crime bill that he signed into law for America\u2019s mass incarceration \u2014 a law that Hillary advocated for and Bernie Sanders voted for. This has become a consistent line of attack against the Clintons. In a scathing Michelle Alexander, author of The New Jim Crow, suggested the 1994 law was a big contributor to mass incarceration. Historian Donna Murch echoed the sentiment."
