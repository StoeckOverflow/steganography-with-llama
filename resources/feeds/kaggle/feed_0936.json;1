        "Sometimes a bad tweet is just a bad tweet. But sometimes a bad tweet can be a PR and business disaster for one of the world\u2019s wealthiest companies. On Tuesday, billionaire venture capitalist Marc Andreessen sent the latter kind of tweet, writing, \u201d has been economically catastrophic for the Indian people for decades. Why stop now.\u201d Andreessen was voicing his frustration at India\u2019s decision to block a new Facebook platform called Free Basics, which would have given Indians who didn\u2019t have mobile data plans free access to a suite of mobile apps, including a version of Facebook itself.",
        "The basic idea behind vaccines is simple: Expose people to a form of a virus, and their bodies\u2019 immune systems will bolster their defenses, protecting them from future encounters with the virus. But in practice, developing a new vaccine can be tricky. Sometimes a vaccine that works in animals shows no effect in humans. Sometimes a vaccine that appears safe in initial trials can produce unforeseen side effects later on. \u201dThere\u2019s always surprises in the vaccine field,\u201d says Philip K. Russell, a retired US Army medical researcher who helped develop vaccines for hepatitis and meningitis.",
        "Hepatitis C is a debilitating illness that wreaks havoc on the liver, making it unable to filter blood and letting toxins spread throughout the body. It kills about 15, 000 people annually.

Recently, he got some good news: There had been an incredible medical breakthrough for people like him.

        "Armed militants\u2019 occupation of a federal building on the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Burns, Oregon, is likely to end today as the last four holdouts surrender to the FBI. The FBI arrested Cliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher whose 2014 standoff with the Bureau of Land Management inspired the Oregon takeover. Bundy, whose sons led the Oregon takeover before their arrest January 28, was taken into custody at the Portland airport on his way to Burns.",
        "The Supreme Court\u2019s decision last June legalizing marriage across the country set up an odd puzzle for LGBTQ people in America. Though everyone can now legally marry the person of their choosing, in many states individuals can still be fired or otherwise discriminated against purely on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The barrier isn\u2019t a religious liberty law, like the one passed to widespread scorn in Indiana last March. Instead, 30 states just don\u2019t include \u201dsexual orientation\u201d and \u201dgender identity\u201d as protected categories under their respective civil rights laws.",
        "One of the remarkable developments of the Democratic presidential primary is the conventional wisdom on foreign policy. Rather than treating Hillary Clinton as the hawk and Bernie Sanders as the dove \u2014 a dynamic that would hurt Clinton in the primary but help her in the general election \u2014 Clinton is considered superior and Sanders more or less hopeless. Whatever you think of their respective foreign policies, it\u2019s hard to deny that Sanders has largely ceded the issue to Clinton. He largely avoids foreign policy, and when he does discuss it he offers platitudes or bizarre and vague proposals.",
        "Another day, another awkwardly comment from a Hollywood celebrity about race. Today\u2019s moment is brought to you by walking, talking award magnet Meryl Streep, who\u2019s set to head the international jury at the Berlin International Film Festival, running through February 21.",
        "One of the problems Hillary Clinton has had in this primary so far is deciding what, exactly, her case against Bernie Sanders should be. She\u2019s had a difficult time of it because, as I\u2019ve written, even her own supporters generally like Sanders quite a lot personally. As a result, she\u2019s been throwing a bunch of things against the wall to see what will stick. Sometimes she says Sanders is too like on his health care views. Sometimes she says he\u2019s not enough, like on gun control and immigration.",
        "Around the world, markets are in chaos. Japan\u2019s stock market plunged 5 percent on Friday, while markets in France, Germany, and the UK all saw big losses on Thursday. The US stock market is doing better than most, but it is also down since the start of the year. Oil hit a new low on Thursday of $26 per barrel. These declines reflect growing concerns that the world economy is headed for another recession.

        "Bernie Sanders won the New Hampshire primary by 20 percentage points, but it\u2019s possible Hillary Clinton will pick up more delegates in the state. How can that be? In short, delegate math is weird. The graphic above explains this in a few simple steps, but the explanation is this: For Democrats, about 85 percent of delegates are bound by how people vote in the primaries. The other 15 percent (superdelegates) can choose whomever they want at the convention, where the party nominates a candidate.",
        "A majority of science teachers across the country are teaching their students about climate change \u2014 but a significant number are teaching incorrect science, such as the notion that rising temperatures are attributable to \u201dnatural\u201d causes. That\u2019s the conclusion of a major survey of US middle and high school science teachers, the results of which were published in the journal Science this week by Eric Plutzer of Penn State and collaborators from Wright State University and the National Center for Science Education.",
        "The seventh Democratic debate of the 2016 season took place against the backdrop of a landslide Bernie Sanders victory in the New Hampshire primary and an electrifying sixth debate that took place just before voters went to the polls. Compared with the previous showdown, it was a much affair, with more moderator involvement and less boring down on particular points of disagreement. Both candidates, ultimately, delivered on their key themes, played up their key strengths, and likely pleased their key supporters.",
        "Two years ago, hardly anyone had heard of the Zika virus. A handful of specialists knew of it as a mostly benign disease that jumped from Africa to a few Pacific islands and occasionally caused, at worst, mild fever, aches, or rash. Nothing to fret about. Then everything changed. The virus arrived in Brazil in 2014, likely brought by a World Cup traveler, and spread rapidly throughout Latin America, carried by the pervasive Aedes aegypti mosquito and infecting millions.",
        "Coming out of Iowa and New Hampshire, Bernie Sanders seemed like he proved the point of his campaign with the demographics of his voters. Exit polls indicated that the Vermont senator is soundly beating Hillary Clinton among voters. In Iowa, Sanders beat Clinton by 57 to 41 among those earning less than $30, 000. In New Hampshire, Sanders won the bottom income bracket by a margin. The notion that Sanders is winning over poor voters while struggling with the rich fits nicely with his campaign message, which is centered on hammering the outsize power of financial elites.",
        "Wind and solar power are pretty great, especially the part about how they don\u2019t create pollution that kills people and threatens the stability of advanced civilization. But they do have their challenges. In my previous post, I discussed one of those challenges: the \u201dduck curve,\u201d i. e. the effect wind and solar energy have on daily demand for utility electricity. Here\u2019s the key graph: Those lines show \u201dnet load\u201d \u2014 which is total demand for electricity minus whatever renewable energy is on the grid \u2014 over a typical spring day in California.",
        "\u201dThe world has seen many great leaders in history. Can you name two leaders, one American and one foreign, who would influence your foreign policy decisions?\u201d As primary debate questions go, that one is a gimme \u2014 the sort of thing that is so commonly asked it practically orders candidates to recite a prepared snippet of hagiography, in the manner of a beauty pageant contestant or a child competing for a school prize.

        "A grand jury indicted New York City police officer Peter Liang for the shooting death of Akai Gurley, an unarmed black man, the Wall Street Journal and Associated Press reported. Liang, a rookie cop, pleaded not guilty to six charges, including manslaughter. Liang shot Gurley at a Brooklyn housing project, while holding a gun in the same hand that he used to open a door. The indictment comes months after grand juries decided not to file charges for the police killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York City.",
        "Mortal enemies are like beautiful kitchens: Some households have them, and when they belong to famous people, we\u2019re immediately more interested in them. Which makes public feuds between mortal enemies akin to fancy custom appliances and gleaming copper pots as far as the eye can see.

        "Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has died of natural causes at a West Texas ranch, as reported by the San Antonio Express. Gov.

        "Saturday night before the Republican presidential debate, Hillary Clinton offered a statement on the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, arguing strongly that President Obama should appoint a successor and the Senate should consider the nominee. She says conservative senators arguing otherwise \u201ddishonor our Constitution\u201d: My thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of Justice Scalia as they mourn his sudden passing. I did not hold Justice Scalia\u2019s views, but he was a dedicated public servant who brought energy and passion to the bench.",
        "Within minutes of the confirmation of the news that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia had died, influential conservatives were laying down the notion that President Obama shouldn\u2019t be allowed to nominate a replacement. Presidential candidate and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz led the charge: Justice Scalia was an American hero. We owe it to him, & the Nation, for the Senate to ensure that the next President names his replacement. \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) February 13, 2016 Conn Carroll, communications director for Utah Republican Mike Lee, who sits on the judiciary committee, joined the parade: What is less than zero?",
        "The sudden death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia means the Supreme Court is now evenly divided between conservatives and liberals. And that means there could be more decisions coming, particularly on consequential cases. In the case of a tie, the lower court\u2019s decision is upheld and no precedent is set. The Court traditionally does not issue an opinion. The Court would have the option to rehear the cases in the following term, and SCOTUSBlog publisher Tom Goldstein argues that\u2019s the most likely eventual outcome.",
        "Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death clarifies the unusual importance of the 2016 election. President Obama took office with only one justice aged 80 or older. The next president will likely take office with two, plus an existing vacancy. Obviously, every presidential election is enormously important. Without Barack Obama winning in 2008, Obamacare wouldn\u2019t have passed, and the EPA likely wouldn\u2019t have taken action on climate change. If Al Gore had taken office in 2001, the US almost certainly wouldn\u2019t have invaded Iraq.",
        "Something very peculiar happened at the Republican debate on Saturday night: When Donald Trump talked, the audience booed. Yet when Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and even John Kasich talked, they got loud cheers and applause. This happened again and again. It even led a spike in Google searches for \u201dWhy are people booing?\u201d Trump, at one point, scoffed that the audience was made up of \u201dJeb [Bush]\u2019s special interests and lobbyists.\u201d It turns out this may not be that .",

Related Why gravitational wave astronomy has physicists so damn excited Burgess is a theoretical physicist at McMaster University in Ontario. Throughout his career, he has authored hundreds of papers on the hardest problems in science: supersymmetry, string theory, wormholes, and dark energy, to name a few.

        "The fight over Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s successor on the Supreme Court is going to be massively more politicized than any nomination fight we\u2019ve seen in decades. It may even be the most acrimonious and nomination fight ever. For the past the Court has been narrowly divided between five conservatives and four liberals. The close split has produced a long series of decisions in which a majority adopted conservative interpretations of the law over the objections of the court\u2019s four liberals.",
        "If you\u2019ve ever believed that people can disagree passionately about politics and still respect and care for each other as friends, the friendship of Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a comfort and an inspiration. He was the Supreme Court\u2019s most outspoken conservative; she is its most outspoken liberal. But their friendship became famous, not just because of its unexpectedness but because their mutual respect and affection for each other was obviously genuine. They and their families spent New Year\u2019s Eve together every year.",
        "The death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia will have countless political and policy ramifications. But here\u2019s a big one: President Obama\u2019s plan to tackle global warming faces considerably less legal peril than it did just three days ago. Last Thursday, the Supreme Court surprised everyone by voting to issue a stay and postpone implementation of Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan \u2014 a major EPA rule to cut emissions from the electricity sector.",
        "Against tremendous opposition from Senate Republicans, Barack Obama has declared that he will too nominate someone to succeed the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. We don\u2019t know for sure who\u2019s on the president\u2019s Supreme Court shortlist, and his lists from 2009 and 2010, when he picked Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, don\u2019t necessarily apply now. Those two were replacing liberal justices and faced a Democratic Senate. Today, Obama has to pick a nominee who\u2019s not just acceptable to a Republican Senate, but acceptable as a replacement for Scalia.",
