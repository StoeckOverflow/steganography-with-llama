        "Donald Trump finally made some bold and provocative claims that were largely true, and the Republican Party finally closed ranks to attack him. Saying Mexican immigrants are rapists didn\u2019t do it. Calling for a return of torture didn\u2019t do it. Calling for a ban on Muslim immigration didn\u2019t do it. Raising questions about Barack Obama\u2019s status as an American citizen didn\u2019t do it. Pretending that thousands of Muslims in New Jersey cheered didn\u2019t do it. So what did?",
        "Vinyl, HBO\u2019s new drama set in the music industry in the \u201970s, has everything going for it. Rating 3. 5 Its pilot was directed by Martin Scorsese. Its showrunner and head writer is Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire vet Terence Winter. It has Mick Jagger behind the scenes to lend authenticity. And its cast is full of great actors, led by swaggering leading man Bobby Cannavale, who\u2019s made a long career of being the best \u2014 or at least wildest \u2014 thing about dozens of projects, from Nurse Jackie to Blue Jasmine.",
        "Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Sunday that Republicans who don\u2019t want President Barack Obama to nominate a successor to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia risk threatening \u201dour democracy itself.\u201d In a short, sharply worded statement, Warren said she couldn\u2019t find the section of the Constitution that tells presidents not to nominate justices \u201dwhen there\u2019s a year left in the term of a Democratic president.\u201d Scalia died suddenly on Saturday, opening a vacancy on the court. \u201dSenate Republicans took an oath just like Senate Democrats did,\u201d said Warren, a former Harvard Law professor, in a statement on her Facebook page.",
        "The great irony of climate change is that it\u2019s so big we can barely care about it. I don\u2019t mean out of malice or ignorance, though there\u2019s plenty of both of those to go around. I just mean that the quantities, numbers, and timespans involved in climate change are so gargantuan that they dwarf our workaday human experience. They are literally difficult to think about, much less to connect to any personal meaning. That\u2019s why those green \u201dchange your lightbulb\u201d campaigns always feel faintly ridiculous.",
        "As President Obama was about to begin his seventh year in office, he said he was entering the \u201dfourth quarter.\u201d Like him, other modern presidents who reach this point realize that time is running short. Elections fade to the background, and considerations about legacy tend to come to the forefront. Yet seven years in, achievements are harder and harder to secure, because presidents headed out the door lose leverage. Both foreign leaders and Congress feel less and less beholden to a president who will be gone soon. They start planning for the future instead.",
        "For months, residents of Flint, Michigan, couldn\u2019t get anyone to pay attention to the problems with their water supply. Then, suddenly, the whole world was watching. After reports that thousands of the city\u2019s children were exposed to lead, celebrities are donating bottled water. Congress held hearings. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders debated in Flint. A steady drip of emails and documents show the state\u2019s long indifference to its residents\u2019 concerns. And the effects of lead poisoning on the city\u2019s children will last a lifetime.",
        "From one angle, Senate Republicans just made a massive mistake. They could have simply waited for President Obama to nominate a replacement for Justice Scalia, drawn out the confirmation process, and then rejected the nominee on ideological grounds months from now. But Senate Republicans didn\u2019t do that. Instead, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell immediately announced he wouldn\u2019t consider any nominee from Obama no matter how qualified, how conservative, or how beloved. What could\u2019ve been a debate over the noxious liberalism of Obama\u2019s choice has now become a debate over the reflexive obstructionism of Senate Republicans.",
        "John Oliver\u2019s Last Week Tonight is back \u2014 with an incredible takedown of controversial voter ID laws from around the country. \u201dIn recent years, some states have made voting easier \u2014 for instance, three states now hold their elections almost entirely by mail, and 30 states plus DC now let you register to vote online,\u201d Oliver said. \u201dSadly, others have gone in the opposite direction \u2014 because depending on who you are and where you live, you may face new obstacles to voting.\u201d Specifically, Oliver looked at laws that require a photo ID to vote.",
        "If you\u2019re a politics junkie, Saturday night turned out to be the worst time ever to be away from the internet. In the span of a few hours, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly, Republicans promised to link arms and block any replacement President Obama might offer up, and Donald Trump, somehow, thought a Republican debate was a good time to call out George W. Bush on Iraq and .",
        "On a night of the Republican convention focused on \u201dmaking America safe again,\u201d one question, strangely, went unanswered: How exactly could policymakers make America safer? Although Americans are in fact safer than they were decades ago, this seems like a pretty crucial question to answer given the first day of the convention\u2019s theme. I previously reached out to criminologists and researchers across the country about this issue. My question: What nonpartisan policies can America use to reduce crime and gun violence without going after the guns themselves?",
        "This year, the Grammy Awards didn\u2019t play around. The 58th annual ceremony enlisted an impressive slate of performers, with Taylor Swift opening the show, Lady Gaga paying tribute to David Bowie, and the Weeknd making his Grammy debut, in addition to Justin Bieber performing his EDM hit \u201dWhere Are \u00dc Now\u201d with Skrillex and Diplo. Then there was Adele, taking the stage even though she wasn\u2019t even nominated this year.",
        "In Harlem earlier this year, Hillary Clinton unveiled a plan to undo one of the biggest problems in America\u2019s criminal justice system. The new $2 billion plan, which goes after the \u201d pipeline,\u201d would incentivize the hiring of \u201dschool climate support teams\u201d \u2014 made up of social workers, behavioral health specialists, and education practitioners \u2014 to work with school staff to reorient and develop comprehensive reform plans for school discipline policies.",
        "It sounds utterly bizarre at first. But the idea of using genetically modified mosquitoes as weapons to kill off wild mosquitoes is rapidly gaining traction. On Tuesday, the World Health Organization said that GM mosquitoes could prove necessary to eradicate the Aedes aegypti mosquito that is spreading the Zika virus all around the Western Hemisphere. The WHO had earlier declared a public health emergency over the possibility that Zika was causing microcephaly, a birth defect associated with infants being born with shrunken heads.",
        "Having crunched the numbers on the tax plans of Republican presidential candidates Jeb Bush, Donald Trump, and Marco Rubio, the Tax Policy Center \u2014 one of the only nonpartisan economic think tanks respected on both sides of the aisle in Washington, DC \u2014 is out with an analysis of Iowa victor Ted Cruz\u2019s tax plan. Cruz\u2019s plan is a more transformative overhaul of the federal tax code than any of those three candidates\u2019 proposals, even Rubio\u2019s.",
        "Results of newly mandatory drug tests for some North Carolina welfare recipients were reported this month, proving the whole process was much ado about nothing. The law, which requires North Carolinians who receive public aid to be screened and possibly tested for drugs, went into effect last August. Applicants are automatically referred for drug testing if they have been convicted of a felony within three years of applying to the program.",
        "On Monday, Russia apparently bombed three Syrian hospitals and a school. The Russians are denying it, blaming the strikes on the United States, but American planes aren\u2019t flying in the parts of northwest Syria where the bombings took place. ISIS has no real presence there, and the group is the sole target of America\u2019s airstrikes. Russia, instead, is striking areas held by Syrian rebels \u2014 and recently it\u2019s been picking up the pace.",
        "A (probably doomed) plan to cap oil exports; Democrats belatedly realize not all of their voters are white; Kendrick Lamar robbed again. Vox Sentences is written by Dylan Matthews and Dara Lind. TOP NEWS OPEC to Iran: Eh, oil\u2019s not so great David Images At an OPEC meeting, Saudi Arabia and Russia reached an agreement to cap oil production at their levels from January, in the hopes of getting other countries to agree.",
        "President Barack Obama criticized Republican frontrunner Donald Trump as unfit for the presidency during a press conference held on Tuesday. Speaking in California after a meeting of leaders from Southeast Asia, Obama spoke about the difficulty of being president and reiterated his belief that Americans would not elect Trump. \u201dI continue to believe that Mr. Trump will not be president. I have a lot of faith in the American people. And I think they recognize that being president is a serious job,\u201d Obama said. \u201dIt\u2019s not hosting a talk show or a reality show. It\u2019s not promotion.",
        "Hillary Clinton gave a sweeping speech on race in Harlem on Tuesday, making a broad and sometimes emotional pitch for Democrats and all Americans to take the threat of systemic racism seriously. Clinton\u2019s speech touched on many topics about race. She discussed mass incarceration. She unveiled her plan to undo the pipeline. She called on the country to help her end segregation in schools. But there was a particularly powerful moment in which Clinton called on all Americans, white included, and particularly Democrats to help eliminate systemic racism. She said: We Democrats have a special obligation.",
        "It\u2019s hard to lose. Obviously you have to deal with the immediate moment afterward, when somebody else is crowned the winner. But you also have to deal with the aftermath \u2014 the part where you replay things in your mind and wonder just what you might have done differently to change what happened. That aftermath can last a few minutes. It can last months. It can last a lifetime. But you have to deal with it somehow.",
        "On Tuesday morning, the US and Cuba signed a civil aviation agreement in Havana, marking the first time since the Cuba embargo was put in place half a century ago that Americans will be able to fly to the island on commercial airlines. It\u2019s a huge breakthrough in President Barack Obama\u2019s push to normalize diplomatic relations between the two countries, but it\u2019s also an enormous opportunity for Americans who are now thinking of making Cuba their next vacation spot.",
        "Saudi Arabia and Russia, the world\u2019s two largest oil producers, joined Qatar and Venezuela at a big OPEC meeting to announce a plan to cap oil production and bring a halt to the slide in crude oil prices that\u2019s rocked global markets over the past couple of years. But don\u2019t expect it to work. The key problem is that even though Saudi Arabia and Russia are huge producers of crude oil, they haven\u2019t been responsible for much of the recent increase in oil supply.",
        "We\u2019re already seeing shortlists for who could replace Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court after his death February 13. And most of those names, as well as previous nominees, have something in common: They\u2019re between the ages of 50 and 60. There is no age requirement to be a Supreme Court justice, as opposed to the US House, Senate, or presidency. But given the time it takes to build up a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 worthy of a Supreme Court nomination, it seems a lawyer is unlikely to be considered for the highest court before his or her late 40s.",
        "We know, without a doubt, that there is a lead poisoning crisis in Flint, Michigan \u2014 the headlines and the data make that fact abundantly, horrifyingly clear. But what\u2019s equally terrifying is that we don\u2019t know how many other Flints there are \u2014 we don\u2019t know how many cities in the United States have similar lead poisoning crises. Cities and states aren\u2019t required to report this information, or to even test all children for exposure.",
        "The FBI captured the iPhone of dead San Bernardino terrorism suspect Syed Rizwan Farook back in December, but encryption technology prevents them from accessing its contents. On Tuesday, a federal magistrate judge in California ordered Apple to write a custom version of the iPhone software that disables key security features and install it on Farook\u2019s iPhone in order to foil the encryption. On Wednesday morning, Apple CEO Tim Cook came out swinging in response.",
        "Donald Trump is not a friend or ally of the Bush family and its important faction of Republican Party donors and operatives. But in terms of the mass party membership, the shift from the party of 2000 and 2004 is less a change in ideology than a shift of points of emphasis.",
        "Welcome to Dear Julia, a column where readers submit everyday health questions. Which painkillers work best? Is it better to run or walk for exercise? Julia Belluz sifts through the research and consults with experts in the field to figure out how science can help us live happier and healthier lives. Dear Julia: What does research say about eating meals late at night? If your friends are anything like young people anywhere, there\u2019s a good chance that after a night out they stop for a snack on the way home. In Toronto, street kebabs or hot dogs were popular.",
        "Many academic journals are extremely expensive. Want to read just one article? That could cost you around $30. The best way to access academic papers is through universities or libraries. But those institutions can pay millions of dollars a year to subscribe to a comprehensive collection. Alexandra Elbakyan has had enough. Elbakyan is a neuroscientist turned academic Robin Hood. In 2011 she founded the website which has grown to host some 50 million academic papers \u2014 Elbakyan claims this is nearly all the paywalled scientific knowledge that exists in the world.",
        "Deadpool begins with a of an absurdist comic book action tableau. The camera pulls back through a freeze frame showing Deadpool tumbling out of a crashing vehicle packed with jostled henchmen. There are bullets flying, bodies flailing, underwear being pulled \u2014 and even a brief nod to star Ryan Reynolds\u2019s previous attempt to launch a movie franchise, the Green Lantern. It\u2019s the cinematic equivalent of an epic, ridiculous splash page. Related Movie review: Deadpool isn\u2019t reinventing the superhero genre. It\u2019s making it better. It\u2019s also a credits sequence, sort of.",
        "Rapper Killer Mike, a prominent supporter and campaign surrogate of Bernie Sanders, took some heat Tuesday for saying at a Sanders rally that \u201da uterus doesn\u2019t qualify you to be president.\u201d Critics decried the comment as sexist, and Killer Mike quickly responded that he was taken out of context and was quoting someone else. But the full context doesn\u2019t make it much better."
