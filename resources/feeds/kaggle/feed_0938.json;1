        "Environmentalists are fond of saying that we have all the technology we need to address climate change \u2014 all we lack is political will. They say it so often it has become a running joke among cynical climate journalists. Everything\u2019s in place except that one little element! Soon as somebody tackles that, we\u2019re golden. But what exactly is political will? How do you make it? How do you know when you have it? To me, it has always sounded like the political equivalent of the Force in the Star Wars movies. It explains everything and nothing.",

        "The conventional wisdom has been that Bernie Sanders is running some version of Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign strategy \u2014 a strategy based on a coalition of young liberals and donations. This conventional wisdom is wrong, or at least radically incomplete. Sanders\u2019s coalition looks very different from what Obama created, or what most experts had expected. According to pollsters and political science professors, Sanders appears to have combined elements of both Obama and Clinton\u2019s 2008 voting blocs \u2014 he\u2019s building something new and untested as an electoral force in American politics.",
        "In many ways, a Donald Trump administration would resemble that of any other Republican. He\u2019d push Congress to slash taxes on the rich, for example, and with Republicans controlling both chambers, he\u2019d likely succeed. But Trump is not a typical Republican. On two key issues, he\u2019s deviated strongly from past policy statements by Republican nominees: immigration and trade. He\u2019s laid out a very ambitious plan to deport millions of unauthorized immigrants and restrict legal migration as well. And he\u2019s spoken of wanting a big tariff on all Chinese imports, with a rate as high as 45 percent.",
        "For years, there\u2019s been a battle in academia over access to knowledge. Proponents of the open access movement argue that science is a public good, often funded by taxpayers, and that locking it up behind expensive paywalls stalls scientific progress. Opponents, particularly the publishers of journals, argue that there are all sorts of costs that go into publishing science and those costs need to be recovered. Without publishers, they argue, there would be no arbiters of science. Enter Alexandra Elbakyan.",
        "A Wall Street Journal story sent alarmed ripples through the internet on Wednesday, with tweets flying about how bosses could be sent \u201dalerts\u201d that their employees have stopped using birth control and might be planning an expensive pregnancy. Turns out, not so much. A more careful read of Rachel Emma Silverman\u2019s piece doesn\u2019t actually support these claims.

        "Donald Trump, on Wednesday, became the latest American to wonder whether when attacked the United States on September 11, 2001, it could have had some help from the government of Saudi Arabia. \u201dIt wasn\u2019t the Iraqis, you will find out who really knocked down the World Trade Center, \u2019cause they have papers in there that are very secret, you may find it\u2019s the Saudis, okay?

        "Pope Francis just tried to shame Donald Trump. The takeaway: Never try to shame Donald Trump. It doesn\u2019t work. In what was supposed to be a bad thing, Francis said Trump\u2019s views on immigration and his plan to build a wall showed that he was \u201dnot Christian.\u201d The remarks come just two days before the South Carolina Republican primary, but Trump seemed unfazed by the possibility of negative publicity.",
        "If you want to know why Saturday\u2019s Nevada caucus has suddenly, in its final weeks, turned from a presumed landslide for Hillary Clinton into a total ask Emily Sandoval and Maggie . Or rather, don\u2019t. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re uninformed; both Sandoval and are politically engaged (they work for a small political consulting firm) and are closely following the Democratic primary.

        "Before last year, scientists knew very little about the Zika virus. As late as 2007, there had only been 14 documented Zika cases in the world. Research on the virus was so limited, in fact, that printouts of all the world\u2019s published literature could basically fit into a shoebox. Suffice to say, researchers now have a lot of questions about Zika. After the virus exploded around Brazil last year, moving on to most of Latin America and the Caribbean, an effort to better understand Zika was on.",
        "Flint, Michigan, is not far from fresh water. The city is sandwiched between three of the Great Lakes: Lake Michigan about 140 miles west, Lake Huron just 40 miles north, and Lake Erie 100 miles or so south. How did a city with such plentiful water sources end up with a terrible lead poisoning problem? The answer is, in part, infrastructure. Water does not naturally contain much lead. But untreated water can damage lead pipes, causing the toxic element to seep into a water source. It can then pick up lead as it travels elsewhere.",
        "Donald Trump isn\u2019t like any politician America has seen lately. But European politics experts argue that his rise was eerily presaged by the assassinated Dutch demagogue Pim Fortuyn. At first blush, Fortuyn may seem an odd choice as a Trump ancestor: Fortuyn was a gay sociology professor, about as far from Trump in background as you can imagine. But both Fortuyn and Trump rose to prominence out of nowhere, almost exclusively by emphasizing sentiment. Both men bucked the existing political establishment, and both proposed banning Muslims from entering the country.",
        "In most states, it is legal for an employer to fire someone, a landlord to evict someone, and a business owner to deny service to someone \u2014 all because the person in question is gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, or queer. Most Americans aren\u2019t okay with that.",

        "Sepsis. Agonizing pain. Emotional trauma. Unnecessary surgery. This is what can happen to pregnant women who are having a miscarriage and get sent to a Catholic hospital that refuses to induce labor because of strict directives from the church. A major investigative piece by Molly Redden published in the Guardian on Thursday details how, over a period of 17 months, one Catholic hospital seriously risked the health of five pregnant women who were miscarrying.

        "The headlines were everywhere Thursday: Pope Francis said that Donald Trump is \u201dnot Christian\u201d because of his views on immigration. That\u2019s how NPR, Yahoo News, and many other outlets, including Vox, reported it. But there was quickly was some pushback. Some commentators argued the pope\u2019s comments had been taken out of context by the media, and that if you looked closely at what he said, Francis didn\u2019t intend to impugn Trump personally. Which narrative is right? It\u2019s an important question. Trump\u2019s call for a wall at the border may be controversial, but it\u2019s hardly unique.",

The votes are still being counted, so the final margin isn\u2019t known. But the media outlets\u2019 quick calls of the race indicate that things weren\u2019t all that close.

Specifically, Marco Rubio now seems increasingly likely to be the last candidate standing against Trump \u2014 especially now that Jeb Bush has quit the race.

        "The pathos of the Jeb Bush presidential campaign has, in the wake of the candidate\u2019s departure from the scene, begun to generate an entirely unwarranted sense of Bush nostalgia. Seth Stevenson, for example, writes in Slate that \u201dJeb Bush Was Not a Joke\u201d and that his concession speech \u201dfelt like a last stand\u201d \u2014 not just for the candidate, but \u201dfor the tattered legacy of the Bush family\u201d and even \u201dfor the quaint notion of civility in public life.\u201d The one thread of truth here is that Jeb was not a joke."
