        "NEW YORK \u2014 In Hillary Clinton\u2019s sweeping plan to boost racial equality if elected president, announced last week in Harlem, her most powerful message may have been to white voters. \u201dWhite Americans need to do a better job at listening when African Americans talk about the seen and unseen barriers they face every day,\u201d she said. \u201dPractice humility rather than assume that our experience is everyone\u2019s experiences.\u201d Yes, during the event, Clinton announced a plan to dismantle racial discrimination and bias through a mix of new and previously proposed policies. She proposed a plan to close the pipeline.",
        "The International Energy Agency (IEA) is supposed to be the world\u2019s leading expert on energy markets. Its analyses of crude oil prices and supplies make headlines, roil Wall Street, and shape how policymakers see the world. And right now, the IEA is a little baffled. \u201dAttempting to understand how the oil market will look during the next five years is today a task of enormous complexity,\u201d the IEA said, almost apologetically, in its latest Oil Market Report.",
        "Of late, Bernie Sanders has been under assault from the technocratic wing of the Democratic Party. The charge? His campaign has circulated economic projections that show stunning \u2014 and rather implausible \u2014 benefits from Sanders\u2019s agenda. Sanders\u2019s \u201dpromises runs against our party\u2019s best traditions of policy making and undermines our reputation as the party of responsible arithmetic,\u201d wrote four Democratic of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. \u201dThese are numbers we would describe as deep voodoo if they came from a Republican,\u201d agreed Paul Krugman.",
        "The HPV vaccine is doing its job: Far fewer teenagers have caught the sexually transmitted infection, which can cause cancer, than in the era. Rates of HPV among teenage girls dropped 64 percent after the vaccine was introduced, from 11. 5 percent to 4. 3 percent, according to a study released today that will be published in the March edition of the journal Pediatrics. Infection dropped among women in their early 20s too, by 34 percent.",
        "So many people have died in the Syrian war that the United Nations has given up counting \u2014 almost 500, 000 is now the best guess. The war has also produced more than 4 million refugees, and more than 6 million people are displaced within Syria, a crisis that is straining neighboring hosts, roiling European politics, and creating the worst humanitarian crisis in the world today. ISIS meanwhile is inventing new ways to horrify the world as it seeks to govern parts of Syria and Iraq and export its terror around the world.",
        "Originally published on Grist. When I first looked at the environmental impact of corn ethanol, I thought it was simple: Growing an acre of corn for fuel means you have to grow another acre elsewhere for food, which ultimately means cutting down forests and releasing a lot of carbon into the atmosphere. Plus, even the Environmental Protection Agency said it was worse than oil. Then I dug a little deeper and realized it might not be as simple as it looked, and that the EPA estimates were rough and out of date.",

        "Last November, Charlie Sheen disclosed that he is . At the time, it seemed like the most responsible thing the actor had done in years. He brought his doctor on the air, and together they explained in clear language the complexities of the medical condition and how antivirals could make the virus \u201dundetectable.\u201d This had a surprising upside. Researchers are now calling Sheen\u2019s actions the \u201dmost significant domestic HIV prevention event in the last decade.\u201d For a newly published study in JAMA Internal Medicine, academics sifted through Google search information in the week after Sheen\u2019s announcement.",
        "This month, Virginia McLaurin did what would have seemed impossible when she was born: The black woman visited the White House to meet the first black president. It was an incredible, touching moment. McLaurin and the Obamas talked, they danced, and they shared admiration. But most telling was one comment from McLaurin: \u201dI thought I would never live to get in the White House.\u201d There is a lot more going on in that statement than you might think.",

TOP NEWS Peace in Syria: in reach Huseyin Images The US and Russia announced today that they\u2019ve negotiated a ceasefire in the Syrian civil war.

        "The Obama administration has released what it says is a new plan for closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay. It includes, among other things, a proposal to transfer a number of the prisoners to an facility on the US mainland for trial or indefinite detention. But, based on the text, it appears to be less of a specific plan and more of a general road map. It definitely doesn\u2019t solve the biggest barrier to closing Guantanamo: that it would require cooperation from Congress, which opposes any such effort.",
        "I was recently invited by Yale Law School\u2019s Global Health Justice Program to talk about medicine and the media. I wanted to share the text here. My focus was on why being a health journalist is an especially effective way to lose friends and alienate people. (It\u2019s really an excuse to talk about some of the questions and themes in health journalism that I think a lot about.) 1) Health journalists thrive on the misery of others Most of the time, we\u2019re covering health issues: obesity, nutrition, diabetes. These are chronic, and relatively boring, killers.",
        "Much of the media is treating the end of Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign as a moment to eulogize the Bush family dynasty. Some are trampling on the family grave, while others are being a bit nostalgic. But in most of these pieces, an ember of hope for the legacy is missing. There\u2019s a fourth generation already in office in Texas \u2014 Jeb\u2019s own son, George Prescott. George P. is getting some attention on social media, where pundits have pointed out that maybe it\u2019s too soon to call an end to the Bush family involvement in presidential politics.",
        "In a recent interview for Paper magazine\u2019s \u201dGirl Crush\u201d series, feminist author bell hooks and actress Emma Watson show that being a feminist doesn\u2019t mean you have to be 100 percent serious at every single moment. In addition to revealing that they\u2019re big fans of each other\u2019s work, hooks and Watson talk about their experiences with feminism and letting go of stereotypes, especially the one that feminism can\u2019t be fun. Watson said hooks became her \u201dgirl crush\u201d after reading hooks\u2019s work while also enjoying her sense of humor in videos of her talks at the New School in 2014.",
        "Libyan fighters are celebrating a major victory on Tuesday: They\u2019ve driven ISIS out of parts of Benghazi, eastern Libya\u2019s largest city, building on advances in and around the city on Sunday. ISIS isn\u2019t just losing in Benghazi. In its home base in Syria and Iraq, it\u2019s lost up to 30 percent of its territory from its peak in August 2014. And it\u2019s tried expanding abroad, officially declaring a wilayat \u2014 which literally means \u201dprovince\u201d and refers to ISIS\u2019s foreign franchises \u2014 in roughly a dozen countries.",
        "Over the past few years, prison inmates have engineered a new way to sneak drugs and other contraband into prison facilities: via drone. The benefits of using drones are manifest. Rather than trying to conceal items in ever more creative ways \u2014 hiding a file inside a birthday cake, melting drugs onto the pages of a coloring book, hiding things inside human orifices \u2014 drones can zoom right over prison walls without undergoing prison guard inspection. And the process is simple.",

But what if the two are connected? Air pollution continues to worsen in the developing world, especially in rapidly developing countries like China and India; at the same time, our global population is aging, and dementia rates are expected to rise accordingly. Increasingly, research suggests a link between air pollution exposure and the risk of diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s.",
        "As researchers learn more about Zika, they\u2019re answering some very basic questions about the virus \u2014 such as how exactly it spreads. Evidence is mounting that it\u2019s not just mosquitoes that can pass the disease from person to person: Zika can be spread through sex, too. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention just announced it\u2019s investigating 14 cases of sexual transmission of Zika in the United States.",
        "Impossibly dense, deep, and powerful, black holes reveal the limits of physics. Nothing can escape one, not even light. But even though black holes excite the imagination like few other concepts in science, the truth is that no astronomer has actually seen one. \u201dThere\u2019s really strong evidence for them, and by now every astronomer believes confidently there are black holes,\u201d Peter Edmonds, a NASA astrophysicist, told me.",
        "Today is Defenders of the Fatherland Day in Russia, a public holiday and a celebration of all things military: triumphalism about the latest weapons, about operations in Syria, about the seizure of Crimea. Meanwhile, from the West we hear bloodcurdling warnings about the threat posed by the Kremlin\u2019s war machine. Perceptions matter, though: Arguably being thought to be dangerous is actually a more powerful geopolitical asset than actually being it.",
        "To fans and supporters of pop idol Kesha, Friday\u2019s court ruling seemed unthinkable: New York Supreme Court Justice Shirley Kornreich effectively forced Kesha to continue working with the man she says raped her. Related Why musicians are tweeting to #FreeKesha The case is a bit more complicated than that. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily make the ruling more just. It also reveals yet another way the justice system can fail victims of rape and abuse \u2014 and shows that even rich and famous women aren\u2019t immune to these failings.",

        "When someone wins the lottery, it can be bad news for his neighbor\u2019s finances. A new study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia examines the relationship between lottery winners in a particular Canadian province and bankruptcies in the same province \u2014 it found that neighbors of lottery winners are unusually likely to go bankrupt, and the larger the lottery prize, the more likely bankruptcy becomes. Specifically, every $1, 000 in lottery winnings translates to a 2. 4 percent higher probability of a nearby neighbor declaring bankruptcy. The researchers have an explanation for why this happens, too.",
        "Could the Republican Party have stopped Donald Trump? The theory goes like this: The Republican Party had the chance to off Trump early, but it didn\u2019t act quickly enough \u2014 and now it may be too late. If only officials had coalesced around Marco Rubio earlier, if only the Super PACs concentrated their fire on Donald Trump faster, if only Jeb Bush had dropped out before South Carolina, if only. ..
