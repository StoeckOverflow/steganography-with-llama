        "Marking the accomplishments birthed by 2009\u2019s Recovery Act (the \u201dstimulus bill\u201d) the Department of Energy\u2019s Loan Programs Office (LPO) has released a set of posters celebrating America\u2019s energy revolution. Between 2009 and 2011, the LPO guaranteed $16. 1 billion in loans to 25 Recovery Act projects, creating jobs and several industries. The posters are modeled after the art used in midcentury Works Progress Administration materials, and they are gorgeous. As far as I know, they only exist as images on DOE\u2019s website.",

        "As the Oscars draw closer, the Hollywood Reporter took a look at the legacy of Hattie McDaniel, best known as the first African American to win an Academy Award in 1940 for her role in Gone With the Wind. It turns out, though, that her impact reaches far beyond cinema. McDaniel played a pivotal role in desegregating housing in Los Angeles. \u201dThe house on 24th street \u2014 when she bought that house, there was a real estate covenant that said, \u2019no blacks, no Hispanics, whatever\u2019 and she said \u2019bullshit,\u2019\u201d MaBel Collins, the partner of McDaniel\u2019s grandnephew Edgar Goff, said.",

        "Has the mainstream Democratic Party become too pessimistic about the possibility of boosting economic growth? That\u2019s the more interesting question sparked by economist Gerald Friedman\u2019s analysis suggesting that Bernie Sanders\u2019s economic agenda, if fully enacted, would lead to 5. 3 percent annual GDP growth, soaring household incomes, and an array of other wondrous effects. The Sanders campaign did not produce the analysis or officially endorse it \u2014 indeed, the Sanders campaign never even framed its proposals as an agenda to boost the growth rate \u2014 but the campaign did promote it.",
        "On Thursday, voters in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland will go to the polls to decide whether to leave the European Union \u2014 an option dubbed \u201dBrexit\u201d \u2014 or stay in. Polls and betting markets suggest that British voters will probably vote narrowly to remain in the EU, but it\u2019s too close to say for sure. But regardless of how the vote turns out, the fact that Britain is having this debate at all is a sign that the political project to unite Europe isn\u2019t going very well.",
        "Brian Sandoval, the moderate Republican governor of Nevada who also happens to have been a federal judge before becoming governor, has been floated by both of his home state\u2019s senators as a possible compromise Supreme Court appointment. The White House is apparently taking the idea seriously enough to have commenced some formal vetting to see if there\u2019s some big reason other than the obvious partisan politics angles not to do this. But then there are the obvious partisan political angles.",
        "On Wednesday night, aired its most daring and powerful episode in its history. In \u201dHope,\u201d the show explored the deaths of Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, Mike Brown, and Sandra Bland and the sensitive topics of police brutality, systemic racism, and the Black Lives Matter movement.

        "Vermont may soon make history: Its legislature could be the very first in the country to legalize marijuana. On Thursday, the Vermont Senate passed a pot legalization bill. It now moves to the House, which will need to approve it before it ends up on the governor\u2019s desk. But Gov. Peter Shumlin has said he supports the bill.

        "As Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders head to the South Carolina primary, they have increasingly focused on trying to recruit black voters to their presidential campaigns. And it\u2019s gotten a bit weird \u2014 with both sides, and particularly white supporters, now throwing up endorsements from civil rights, racial justice, and Black Lives Matter leaders as a sign black voters should support them.",

        "The film industry is a vast, complicated, and frequently shadowy system propped up by tradition and ego. Actors bear the brunt of media scrutiny, due to their pop culture prominence and relative accessibility to those asking questions. But with so much money at stake, it\u2019s nearly impossible to convince the people making decisions behind the scenes in Hollywood to be frank about how they make those decisions. Agencies are the best example of just how guarded Hollywood can be.",

        "In the US, rural areas and constituencies have typically weighed against progress on clean energy. But that may be changing. A new story out of Wisconsin illustrates that a slow, tentative shift is underway, as rural electricity consumers and the utilities that serve them take a new look at the benefits of solar power. In fact, if you squint just right, you can even glimpse a future in which rural America is at the vanguard of decarbonization.",
        "The Best Animated Feature category at the 2016 Oscars is a great reminder that animation is one of the most vibrant art forms out there right now. Forget the era when the category would be stuffed to the gills with mediocre films from studios. Nowadays, with the rise of indie animation distributors like GKIDS, the Best Animated Feature race celebrates a vast range of animated projects, from behemoths to tiny films from Brazil.",
        "Apple has filed its official reply to the FBI\u2019s demand that it write software to help the bureau access the iPhone of San Bernardino terrorism suspect Syed Farook. Consistent with its earlier public statements, Apple condemns the FBI\u2019s request as an unprecedented expansion of government power that would endanger the privacy of Apple users. I expressed some skepticism of this argument last week, but I found Apple\u2019s latest response pretty persuasive. One danger is that an FBI win could set a legal precedent that puts us on a slippery slope to the routine use of smartphones for government surveillance.",
        "By now, you may have heard that Hillary Clinton supported the controversial 1994 bill that her husband signed into law. Black Lives Matter activists have called her out for it. Michelle Alexander, author of The New Jim Crow, did as well.

        "Five candidates took the stage in Houston to debate whom the Republican Party should nominate for president, but only three of them really mattered and one of them \u2014 frontrunner Donald Trump \u2014 truly dominated the evening. He talked more than any of his rivals and was talked about more than any of his rivals, because the Republican Party has finally gotten serious about the idea that unless something drastic changes soon, he is likely to be the GOP nominee. Thursday night was the first debate to feature sustained multidirectional attacks on Trump with little infighting between the candidates.",
        "Lands\u2019 End, the clothing retailer known for its monogrammed backpacks and family aesthetic, published an interview with Gloria Steinem in its catalogue to honor her as a feminist legend.

        "It\u2019s more important to elect Hillary Clinton in 2016 than it was to elect Barack Obama in 2008, former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau wrote in a column published in the Daily Beast on Friday. In an impassioned essay that reads very much like a speech, Favreau tries directly confronting the public perception of Clinton as inauthentic, cautious, and more motivated by polls than by genuine convictions.",
        "Someone keeps changing \u201dblack lives matter\u201d to \u201dall lives matter\u201d on the walls at Facebook\u2019s headquarters, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is fed up. \u201dDespite my clear communications at Q&A last week that this was unacceptable, and messages from several other leaders across the company, this has happened again,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote today on a private company Facebook page, according to Gizmodo, which has a copy of the post.",
        "Why are Americans expected to die sooner than their peers in other countries? A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association takes a look at the question. The results are, well, not too surprising \u2014 three of the big drivers for the year analyzed, 2012, were guns, drugs, and cars. The study looked at these causes of injury deaths, which are the three biggest causes of injury death in the US and altogether account for more than 100, 000 early deaths each year in America.",
        "Hillary Clinton absolutely crushed Bernie Sanders in the South Carolina primary election on Saturday, defeating the senator by nearly 50 points. And Sanders appears very likely to be in for a lot more of these kind of losses over the next few weeks. His strategy hinged on pulling voters, particularly minority voters, from Clinton\u2019s camp. But according to several recent surveys from Public Policy Polling, many of those voters may have already made up their minds. [&lt;a href=\u201d . \u201d mce_href=\u201d .",
        "Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t just take the vast majority of the available delegates in South Carolina on Saturday night. She also took away one of Bernie Sanders\u2019s strongest arguments \u2014 that he\u2019s the candidate who has the most support. In Iowa and New Hampshire, Sanders had done better than Clinton among voters in the lowest income brackets. That seemed to bolster his claim that his \u201dpolitical revolution\u201d could energize millions of new voters who typically don\u2019t turn out to vote. This argument, however, is much less tenable after tonight."
