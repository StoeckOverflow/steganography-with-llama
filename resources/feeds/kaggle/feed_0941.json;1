        "Hillary Clinton is on pace to beat Bernie Sanders by about 37 points in South Carolina, in large part because of her huge margin among black voters. Clinton did even better among black voters than President Barack Obama in 2008, according to exit polling. Her victory speech reflected her coalition. \u201dWe also have to face the reality of systemic racism that more than a half a century [after] Rosa Parks sat and Dr. King marched and John Lewis bled still plays a significant role in determining who gets ahead in America and who gets left behind,\u201d Clinton said.",
        "Hillary Clinton has two problems she needs to solve. If she wins the Democratic primary, she needs to do so without alienating Bernie Sanders\u2019s voters. And if she\u2019s going to win the general election and govern effectively afterward, she needs to run a campaign that doesn\u2019t completely alienate independents and Republicans. Both problems may have the same solution: Donald J. Trump. Up until a few weeks ago, the Clinton campaign didn\u2019t really believe they could be so lucky as to have Trump as the Republican nominee.",
        "Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign has always known that it needs to play with black voters if it\u2019s going to win the Democratic primary. South Carolina was Sanders\u2019s first big chance to show he could make inroads with this group, and it looks like he completely and utterly failed. Clinton winning black voters bigger margin than Obama in 2008, when he won \u2014 Martin Gelin (@M_Gelin) February 28, 2016 That is, needless to say, very bad news for Sanders.",
        "Hillary Clinton decisively won today\u2019s South Carolina Democratic primary, according to multiple sources, by what election projections are calling an \u201doverwhelming\u201d margin. Final results are not yet in, but exit polls suggest she will secure 68 percent of the vote to Bernie Sanders\u2019s 31 percent. That 37 percentage point margin is even better than an expected victory margin of 26 percent based on RealClearPolitics\u2019 polling average. Sanders never stood much of a shot in a state whose voters consist largely of African Americans and more conservative whites, with few of the white liberals who serve as his base.",
        "The 88th annual Academy Awards will begin at 8:30 pm Eastern on Sunday, February 28, broadcast live on ABC from the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles. But right now, if you\u2019re thinking about the Oscars, it\u2019s probably because you\u2019re filling out a ballot in hopes of winning your friendly local Oscar pool. And if you need informed choices, we\u2019ve got \u2019em. Related All 57 movies nominated for an Oscar, ranked There isn\u2019t much room for upset this year, even though there will always be one or two assumed locks that completely fall apart.",
        "Appearing this morning on Jake Tapper\u2019s State of the Union, Donald Trump was asked to disavow support from former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and other white supremacists and politely declined. Trump, being a cautious sort and not one to just talk without gathering all the facts and giving a matter serious consideration, said he would have to do more research because at the moment he lacked sufficient information to disavow them. The question arose when Tapper asked Trump about the League\u2019s request that he disavow Duke\u2019s endorsement and that of other white supremacist groups.",
        "Like this video? Subscribe to Vox on YouTube. This fact has been vexing humans for centuries: Earth\u2019s year (one orbit around the sun) isn\u2019t neatly divisible by its day (one rotation about its axis). One full orbit takes more than 365 days but less than 366. That\u2019s not surprising \u2014 there\u2019s no reason for the two to be linked. The trouble comes when we try to overlay a useful calendar onto this random system. And as a result, our annual calendar is always slightly wrong. As the short video above shows, leap year is our solution to this problem.",
        "Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the Senate\u2019s leading immigration opponent, endorsed Donald Trump today onstage during a rally in Alabama. Sessions is the first senator to endorse Trump. Along with the endorsements of Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Paul LePage of Maine on Friday, and of former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer on Saturday, it\u2019s another sign that many in the Republican Party are beginning to accept that Trump will likely be their nominee. But Sessions\u2019s endorsement of Trump also makes a great deal of sense. Trump is, in many ways, building on Sessions\u2019s intellectual framework.",
        "Even when the winners are a surprise, awards shows are long and . And most of the time, they\u2019re hopelessly predictable. Despite their grandeur, the Oscars \u2014 in all their pomp and circumstance and trailing gowns \u2014 are no exception. At the very least, though, the 2016 Oscars have enlisted Chris Rock to host, which just about guarantees a sharper monologue than most hosts would dare to deliver. Also, he\u2019s bound to reference the growing protests against the Academy\u2019s acting nominees, not to mention their attempts to stem the overwhelming tide of poor publicity with overhauls to their membership.",
        "Every Sunday, we pick a new episode of the week. It could be good. It could be bad. It will always be interesting. You can read the archives here. The episode of the week for February 20 through February 27, 2016, is \u201dHope,\u201d the 16th episode of the second season of ABC\u2019s . \u201dHope\u201d is an astonishingly good episode of television, frank yet funny in a way that shows at its very best.",
        "The 88th Academy Awards, the biggest entertainment awards show of the year, are going down tonight at 8:30 pm Eastern. You can watch them on ABC; you can also tune in to the ABC website for a live stream of the show, though you\u2019ll need a login from your cable provider. And Vox will be the whole spectacle right here. Will host Chris Rock\u2019s monologue tackle #OscarsSoWhite? Will Spotlight surprise everyone and win Best Picture over the heavily favored The Revenant? Will Leonardo DiCaprio finally win one of those damn gold statues?",
        "Netflix\u2019s Fuller House, the to the \u201980s and \u201990s sitcom Full House, is not a good television show. Rating 2 No, what Fuller House is is familiar television. Even when you watch a few episodes in a row \u2014 as Netflix surely hopes you will \u2014 it feels like just leaving the TV on as rerun after rerun piles up. The laugh lines are predictable. The gags play out exactly as you\u2019d expect. Stephanie Tanner (Jodie Sweetin) still says, \u201dHow rude,\u201d even though she\u2019s now in her 30s. Even the show\u2019s premise is a reworking of Full House.",
        "MADISON, ALABAMA \u2014 When I asked people at a rally here why they support Trump, the most common reason I heard caught me by surprise. Yes, some said they liked Trump on immigration and the border. Others mentioned his business experience. But the most common reason: He flouts \u201dpolitical correctness.\u201d \u201dHe\u2019s representing things that I agree with. He\u2019s politically incorrect,\u201d James Lamm of Owens Cross Roads told me. \u201dThey\u2019re things a lot of people are thinking. Things most of the American people agree with,\u201d his wife, Katherine Lamm, added.",
        "There\u2019s a simple, compelling argument that the world ought to be building many more nuclear power plants. We\u2019ll need vast amounts of energy to stave off global warming. It\u2019s not at all clear that renewables can do the job alone. And nuclear is a proven technology, already providing 11 percent of electricity globally. So what\u2019s the catch? Cost is a big one. More than safety or waste issues, cost is nuclear\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel. reactors have become jarringly expensive to build, going for $5 billion to $10 billion a pop.",
        "Chris Rock\u2019s biting monologue Sunday night at the Academy Awards pulled no punches on Hollywood\u2019s longstanding lack of diversity. \u201dI\u2019m here at the Academy Awards, otherwise known as the white people\u2019s choice awards,\u201d Rock said in his opening joke. \u201dI realized if they nominated hosts, I wouldn\u2019t even get this job. You\u2019d be watching Neil Patrick Harris right now.\u201d Rock, however, also turned his fire on the Academy\u2019s critics.",
        "One of the most common human behaviors is also one of our most perplexing: Our tendency to get all worked up about other people\u2019s business. Anyone on Twitter knows that people will jump on a hair trigger to condemn the moral failings of others. Perhaps you\u2019ll remember when Justine Sacco, a former communications director with IAC, tweeted this: \u201dGoing to Africa. Hope I don\u2019t get AIDS. Just kidding. I\u2019m white!\u201d It was a dumb, dumb thing to say. She deserved someone calling her out for it. But thousands and thousands of people responded to her tweet.",
        "There are two big questions to keep in mind when looking at the results from the 11 states voting in the Democratic primary contest on Super Tuesday. One is quite literally whether Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders gets closer to amassing the number of delegates necessary to win the campaign. The first candidate to rack up 2, 382 delegates secures the Democratic nomination, and 865 of them are up for grabs on Tuesday. Right now, it looks like Clinton could rack up around 200 more delegates tomorrow than Sanders.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s initial refusal to repudiate former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke \u2014 followed by an unconvincing explanation for why he did so \u2014 was interpreted by some as a cynical play for racist votes ahead of Super Tuesday. But for those who thought the KKK had more or less gone extinct, there\u2019s evidence that the white supremacist group is alive and well. As Vox\u2019s Andrew Prokop reported in 2014, one analysis found 41 states have an active KKK chapter, and there are at least 160 chapters around the country, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.",
        "What do we really know about the research on whether gun restrictions help reduce gun deaths? It\u2019s a crucially important question in light of the horrible news out of Orlando, but even for PhDs, it\u2019s a tough one. There\u2019s been a mountain of research on the subject, but these dozens of studies conducted over many years and in many different countries reach a broad and sometimes contradictory range of conclusions. It\u2019s hard to know what it really tells us, taken together, about whether gun laws can reduce gun violence.",
        "What are the odds of being born on leap day? Slim. So slim that leap baby Adam Piekarski decided to get his daughter to do the math with him to prove to her how special he is. \u201dEveryone that I\u2019ve met that\u2019s been born on a leap year seems special,\u201d he said. \u201dI personally think they think differently and they see differently.\u201d Normally, the chance of being born on any given day is 1 in 365. But for leap babies, it\u2019s four times that, plus an extra day. That comes out to 1 in 1, 461. So only 0.",
        "Spotlight, Tom McCarthy\u2019s drama about the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church, was named Best Picture at the Oscars Sunday, February 28, 2016. But did it deserve the award? We gathered some of our writers to discuss. Is Spotlight just Oscar bait? Todd VanDerWerff: Of the three nominees with a realistic shot at winning \u2014 The Big Short, The Revenant, and this \u2014 Spotlight was my preference (though I liked Mad Max and Brooklyn better of all nominees).",
        "The 2016 Oscars were a weird roller coaster ride of expectations. The movie that won the night\u2019s first award, Best Original Screenplay, bookended the evening by also winning Best Picture \u2014 but those were the only two prizes it won. In between, a action spectacular cleaned up, an art film won three awards, and host Chris Rock kept the focus squarely on the Oscars\u2019 diversity (or lack thereof). Naturally, the ceremony was not without controversy, but said controversy didn\u2019t always come from the direction you\u2019d expect.",
        "Until this month, Google could boast that its cars had logged more than a million miles without causing a single accident.

But on Valentine\u2019s Day, Google suffered the first accident where one of its cars was at least partially to blame. Here\u2019s what happened, according to Google\u2019s official report to California regulators.",
        "With marriage now legal in the US, the next big legal fight for LGBTQ rights may finally be underway. On Tuesday, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed two lawsuits in federal court alleging that two companies engaged in discrimination, in violation of federal civil rights law. Chris Geidner reported for BuzzFeed: In Maryland, the EEOC sued Pallet Companies, alleging that the company discriminated against Yolanda Boone \u201dby subjecting her to harassment\u201d because she is a lesbian, resulting in her being fired, and by retaliating against Boone when she complained about the harassment.",
        "When it comes to Zika, there are many more unknowns than knowns. One big question about the virus has been whether a Zika infection can cause a rare and sometimes deadly neurological condition in which people\u2019s immune systems damage their nerve cells, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, or, in rare cases, death. New proof of a link with was published Monday in the Lancet.",
        "The results are in from all of the 12 states that voted on Super Tuesday. Donald Trump won seven states (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia). Ted Cruz won three states (Alaska, Oklahoma and Texas) and Marco Rubio won one state (Minnesota). On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton won seven states (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia) and Bernie Sanders won four states (Colorado, Minnesota, Oklahoma, and Vermont).",
        "Marco Rubio\u2019s supporters have an awful hard time thinking of a major accomplishment in their candidate\u2019s career. Former Sen. Rick Santorum ( ) who endorsed Rubio after ending his own presidential bid, was asked to name something Rubio achieved in office. He fumbled at length before conceding, \u201dThe bottom line is there isn\u2019t a whole lot of accomplishments.\u201d Then there was Rep.",
        "Tens of millions of Iranians voted on Friday, for parliament and for the body that will likely pick the next supreme leader, in an election with but potentially major consequences for the country, its future, and its relationship with the outside world. moderates swept the vote, seemingly defeating the who\u2019ve long dominated Iran\u2019s government. It\u2019s worth a couple of important caveats.",
        "Donald Trump has won the Georgia primary, according to Fox and NBC News. This wasn\u2019t a surprise, as recent polls showed Trump with a lead. Losing Georgia is bad news for Marco Rubio Georgia should have been Marco Rubio territory. Atlanta, Savannah, and their surrounding suburbs are full of the kind of suburban professionals that have been most receptive to Rubio\u2019s message. A recent rally in Kennesaw, a suburb of Atlanta, attracted 7, 000 people, according to Politico, compared to just 1, 200 for a nearby Ted Cruz rally.",
        "Hillary Clinton has won Virginia\u2019s Democratic primary, according to projections from multiple media outlets. Clinton was heavily favored to win Virginia. The state\u2019s Democratic electorate has a substantial number of black voters, who supported Clinton overwhelmingly in Nevada and South Carolina. She was ahead by 20 points in preprimary polling, and the Sanders campaign didn\u2019t put as much energy into campaigning there as it did in some of the other states up for grabs today. According to exit poll estimates, the electorate appears to have skewed toward older voters."
