        "Ben Carson, the pathbreaking pediatric neurosurgeon turned Tea Party darling, plans to tell supporters he does not see a \u201dpath forward\u201d for his campaign and will not attend Thursday night\u2019s Republican debate, according to a report in the Washington Post. He\u2019s not technically suspending his campaign \u2014 not yet, anyway \u2014 but he\u2019s essentially conceding it\u2019s over. Carson entered the campaign as a long shot, mostly coasting on notoriety he\u2019s built up in conservative circles ever since he confronted President Barack Obama and assailed Obamacare at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast.",
        "There\u2019s a certain point in every election cycle when pollsters stop using what\u2019s called the \u201dgeneric ballot\u201d question \u2014 \u201dDo you plan to vote for a Democrat or a Republican?\u201d \u2014 and start asking about specific candidates. Pollsters moved on months ago. But the rise of the #NeverTrump coalition \u2014 a marriage of convenience between Republican establishment types and professionals \u2014 brings its adherents right back there. They are stuck staring at a generic ballot: Trump versus Not Trump.",
        "When Susan Thornton was 30, she noticed a flat red rash in a small band around her waist. It was itchy and terribly persistent. No cream or lotion made it go away. One year and half a dozen dermatologists later, she was diagnosed with mycosis fungoides, a rare form of lymphoma that\u2019s often mistaken for eczema or psoriasis in its early stages. years later, Thornton\u2019s cancer is still around. It persists mostly as a manageable rash, treated with a topical steroid. At certain points the disease has flared up, requiring more drastic treatments.",
        "After a month of preliminary skirmishes, the 2016 presidential primaries have finally reached states with nontrivial numbers of people in them. Texas was by far the biggest state participating in Super Tuesday, but a number of midsize states \u2014 Georgia, Massachusetts, Virginia, Tennessee \u2014 all larger than any of the four states that have already voted, were also in the mix.",
        "The results are in for all of the 12 states that voted on Super Tuesday. Donald Trump won seven states (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, and Virginia). Ted Cruz won three states (Alaska, Oklahoma, and Texas) and Marco Rubio won one state (Minnesota). On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton won seven states (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia) and Bernie Sanders won four states (Colorado, Minnesota, Oklahoma, and Vermont).",
        "Nina, the biopic about indomitable musician Nina Simone, has been riddled with controversy and turbulence since its inception. And now the first trailer for the project is finally here. The film, which stars Zoe Saldana as Simone and David Oyelowo as Simone\u2019s assistant and eventual manager Clifton Henderson, focuses on the years when Simone was living in France. Simone had left the United States in the \u201970s and rotated between living in the Netherlands, Liberia, Barbados, Belgium, England, Switzerland, and France before settling in France in 1992. She died in France in 2003.",
        "MSNBC cut ties this weekend with host Melissa one of the very few women of color hosting a national cable news show. who is also a professor at Wake Forest University, had a devoted following. Her fans discussed her show on Twitter with the hashtag #nerdland. They praised the show\u2019s thoughtful take on the news and its unusually diverse lineup of guests. Erik Wemple of the Washington Post called a \u201drare voice of substance on cable news.\u201d had been fairly quiet after the release of her letter blasting MSNBC brass for repeatedly preempting her show.",
        "The head of the Democratic Party is supporting a effort to weaken Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, opening up a rift between the party\u2019s factions during an already bitter presidential primary fight. Democratic National Committee Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz has joined conservative lawmakers\u2019 efforts to curtail coming CFPB regulations about predatory payday lending \u2014 a practice that often traps poor borrowers in endless cycles of debt. The Huffington Post broke the story on Tuesday, obtaining a memo showing Wasserman Schultz hoped to attract other Democrats to support a bill to rein in the CFPB.",
        "The gene that causes Huntington\u2019s disease, a neurodegenerative disorder, was identified in 1993. But in the decades since, scientists have not figured out how, exactly, those genes cause the symptoms associated with the disorder: the mental decline, the jerky movements, the emotional changes that make the condition so difficult to live with. \u201dWe know that in some way, [the gene] distorts the protein that\u2019s encoded on it, and it changes its functions,\u201d says Rachel Harding, who studies the structure of these proteins at the University of Toronto.",
        "Why does the media cover Donald Trump so much? It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve been asked a lot over the course of the primary season. The answer is, in part, that it\u2019s increasingly likely he\u2019ll be the Republican Party nominee for president and so he surely deserves a lot of coverage. But many people feel like the media\u2019s Trump obsession is the cause of his rise, making this illegitimate as an explanation. So here\u2019s another view: The media covers Trump a lot because Trump\u2019s campaign is fascinating and people are interested in it.",
        "North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test way back in January 6, and the very next day the US and China began negotiating over what to do about it. China is North Korea\u2019s protector and sole ally, so expectations were low. But this Wednesday, two months later, the UN Security Council unanimously approved a resolution, drafted by the US and China, punishing North Korea with some of the toughest sanctions in decades. A number of North Korean officials are sanctioned, and all cargo in and out of the country must be inspected, along with other measures.",
        "The person scheduled to give the closing benediction at tonight\u2019s Republican National Convention is a Muslim immigrant from Pakistan. Yes, seriously. His name is Sajid Tarar, and he\u2019s the founder of an organization called \u201dAmerican Muslims for Trump.\u201d Given Donald Trump\u2019s controversial stance on Muslims, in particular his call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the US, this might be more than a bit surprising to hear.",
        "Another video of a police shooting has once again put attention on racial disparities in the criminal justice system. On Tuesday, police shot and killed Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The video shows police pinning Sterling down, then shooting him after allegedly seeing a gun. Video has been changing Americans\u2019 views toward police for more than 25 years. In 1991, four white Los Angeles police officers brutally beat Rodney King, an unarmed black man, as it was caught on video, sparking local riots and putting a spotlight on longstanding feelings of distrust toward law enforcement in minority communities.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s tax plan would raise $1. 1 trillion over the next decade, with nearly 80 percent coming from the top 1 percent of Americans, a new analysis by the Tax Policy Center shows. So far this cycle, the Tax Policy Center \u2014 the leading nonpartisan think tank for tax and revenue issues \u2014 has released analyses of the tax plans of Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Jeb Bush, who is no longer in the race. This week, TPC started to crunch the numbers on Democratic plans. First up is Hillary Clinton.",
        "One of the central planks in President Obama\u2019s climate plan is a rule to ratchet up fuel economy standards through 2025. New US cars and light trucks are supposed to get better and better mileage with each passing year. At least, that was the dream. But now cheap oil is messing that up. Recent data from the Transportation Research Institute at the University of Michigan shows that overall fuel economy for new cars, SUVs, vans, and pickup trucks sold in the United States has been stagnating ever since oil prices crashed last year: This chart seems a little counterintuitive.",
        "Donald Trump made an unbelievable claim at the Fox News Republican debate Thursday night: He could balance the budget by negotiating down drug prices. That\u2019s pretty much impossible: Medicare spent, as Fox pointed out, about $78 billion on prescription drugs last year \u2014 way less than the $300 billion that Trump believes we can save. Moderator Chris Wallace was calling out Trump\u2019s proposed tax cuts. He pointed out that even with his proposed spending cuts \u2014 killing off the Education Department and EPA \u2014 his plan would still leave the country with a $544 billion deficit.",
        "At the Fox News Republican presidential debate on Thursday, Donald Trump suggested that he has a large penis. This actually happened. During an exchange about the personal attacks Rubio has made on Trump, Rubio said that if any candidate \u201ddeserved\u201d to be personally attacked it was Trump, because of how much he attacks others. Trump responded with surprise that Rubio \u201dhit my hands. Nobody has ever hit my hands. I\u2019ve never heard of this.\u201d Then he spread his palms out. \u201dLook at those hands. Are they small hands?",
        "The third and at long last final general election presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will take place on Wednesday, October 19. The debate, which is in Las Vegas, Nevada, will last 90 minutes and be moderated by Fox News\u2019s Chris Wallace.",
        "There\u2019s a sense of growing optimism among Democrats that if Donald Trump is at the top of the ticket they might have a chance at what otherwise seems impossible: curtailing the GOP\u2019s stranglehold on the US House of Representatives. The fundamental landscape is deeply unfavorable to House Democrats. They\u2019re down 30 seats and behind in fundraising with district boundaries drawn in such a way that winning a national majority of votes won\u2019t deliver them a majority of seats. They need, fundamentally, something and weird to happen.",
        "Timothy Gowers\u2019s first big assault on academic publishing started almost by accident. In 2012, the Cambridge mathematician took to his blog to write a post bemoaning the exorbitant prices that journals charge for access to research. Gowers vowed to stop sending his papers to any journal from the world\u2019s largest academic publisher, Elsevier. Timothy Gowers To his surprise, the post went viral \u2014 and spurred a worldwide boycott of Elsevier, which publishes 2, 000 journals that can cost up to 10 or 20 thousand dollars a year for a subscription.",
        "Bernie Sanders has proposed a lot of tax increases. True to his brand of democratic socialism, he wants to boost the top income tax rate to 52 percent, add a new 2. 2 percent income tax and 6. 2 percent payroll tax for everyone, make the rich pay Social Security taxes, make corporations pay taxes on foreign profits as they\u2019re earned, tax carbon, tax financial transactions, and raise the top estate tax rate to 65 percent for billionaires, to name a few of his proposals. Whether you love or hate those ideas, they add up.",
        "Like this video? Subscribe to Vox on YouTube. Black people are rarely featured in and fantasy films \u2014 that is, unless that black person is Will Smith. So how do black people get to exist in the future? Afrofuturism is one answer. Culture critic Mark Dery coined the term in his 1994 essay, \u201dBlack to the Future\u201d to point out the lack of black writers and black stories in science fiction. Today, it\u2019s expanded into a scholarly and artistic movement that imagines the future through a black cultural lens with social justice in mind.",
        "At the Conservative Political Action Conference today, Republican presidential candidate John Kasich argued that we should \u201dUberize the federal government.\u201d Kasich didn\u2019t go into much detail about what this means, but it\u2019s a line that he\u2019s been using for weeks on the campaign trail. And Kasich is not the only one who has pointed to Uber as a symbol for everything that\u2019s right with capitalism. Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and former presidential candidates like Jeb Bush and Rand Paul have all touted Uber on the campaign trail.",
        "To date, electric vehicles have mostly been a curiosity, a means for the wealthy to display their . In most big markets (the US, the EU, China) they amount to less than 1 percent of new vehicles sales. Consequently, most people, notably oil industry people, treat them as a sideshow. But that\u2019s going to change, soon, according to a new research brief from Bloomberg New Energy Finance.",
        "Teachers in Detroit are calling in sick en masse forcing the public school district to close nearly all of its campuses. of Detroit Public Schools\u2019 97 schools closed Monday due to widespread \u201dsickouts,\u201d teacher demonstrations involving calling in sick to protest the school district\u2019s recent budgetary failures. Over the weekend the school district\u2019s newly appointed manager Judge Steven Rhodes announced Detroit Public Schools would be unable to pay teacher salaries through the summer. Rhodes replaced one of Michigan\u2019s most controversial emergency managers in March.",
        "The 2016 cycle\u2019s 11th Republican presidential debate became an contest within minutes, and proceeded to force viewers to question what counts as debate, or as political discourse, or as communication between human beings, for a full two hours. Marco Rubio referred to Donald Trump as \u201dBig Don,\u201d out loud, in a room with people and microphones in it. Ted Cruz at one point declared, \u201dI really hope we don\u2019t see yoga on this stage.\u201d Even the ostensibly \u201dmoderate\u201d John Kasich went out of his way to praise deposed Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi for some reason.",
        "This week saw the release of the trailer for Nina, a controversial Nina Simone biopic starring Zoe Saldana. It\u2019s a gross understatement to say it was not . The movie promises to honor the legacy of one of the most iconic and indomitable women in American music, but seems to be doing the opposite. The casting of Saldana to play the Simone has sparked an ongoing controversy.",
        "A few hours after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un announced he had ordered his country\u2019s military on standby for nuclear strikes, the threats came up at Thursday\u2019s Republican presidential debate, and the candidates repeated one of the most common misconceptions about the hermit kingdom. \u201dYou indeed do have a lunatic in North Korea,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio said. Sen. Ted Cruz also called Kim a \u201dlunatic,\u201d as did debate moderator Chris Wallace. The image you get of Kim Jong Un is of an unpredictable wild man, an out of control crazy person, careening around northeast Asia with nuclear weapons.",
        "For the first time in nearly a month, Donald Trump looks mortal again. Four states held Republican primaries or caucuses on Saturday, but the GOP frontrunner came away with just two wins that were both quite narrow, in Louisiana and Kentucky. He lost the Maine caucuses \u2014 his first defeat in the Northeast \u2014 and got blown out in Kansas. And for the first time, it appeared that most of the voters across the country broke toward the same candidate \u2014 Ted Cruz.",
        "Super Saturday is mostly a dumb name made up by television networks to try to persuade you to waste a Saturday night staying home and watching election results on TV. There aren\u2019t a ton of delegates at stake in the five states that voted Saturday night, and many of the races were idiosyncratic caucuses where the results may tell us more about candidates\u2019 ground games and organization than their actual popularity."
