        "Nancy Reagan\u2019s death at 94 has the feeling both of tragedy and of metaphor. The tragedy comes first. Reagan\u2019s role as an adoring and adored wife and mother is known \u2014 this love letter from Ronald Reagan to Nancy is worth reading and tearing up over \u2014 but as the New York Times writes, her influence on American politics is often underestimated. \u201dWithout Nancy, there would have been no Governor Reagan, no President Reagan,\u201d Michael Deaver, a top staffer to President Ronald Reagan and a close friend of the family, said in 2007.",
        "The most important global warming story over the past two years has arguably been China\u2019s struggle to suppress its appetite for coal. And lately, those efforts have begun paying off. Recent data suggests that China\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions fell in 2015, driven by a sharp drop in coal use.",
        "When the Hubble Space Telescope stares into the deepest reaches of space, it is also looking backward in time. The further away the light source, the older it is. In the video above, NASA uses it to zoom into the oldest and farthest galaxy Hubble has ever seen. The light from the galaxy, called is 13. 4 billion years old, or just 400 million years after the Big Bang (i. e. the beginning of time). The light is so old, it was created before the Earth formed.

        "There have been seven Democratic presidential debates so far, and none of them have featured any questions about abortion. The candidates have mentioned reproductive rights on their own a few times, but not because a moderator raised the issue. This omission has been a source of frustration for reproductive rights advocates. Tonight was no exception. So now making it through a full SEVEN debates without bothering to #askaboutabortion. We want to know the candidates\u2019 plans! #DemDebate \u2014 Robyn Swirling (@RSwirling) March 7, 2016 It shouldn\u2019t bear repeating, but evidently it does.",
        "Bernie Sanders won the Maine caucus by a big margin on Sunday night, giving him three victories out of the four contests held this weekend. That seems impressive, but the number of delegates awarded make it sound a little less so. Though Sanders also took Nebraska and Kansas on Saturday, he and Hillary Clinton are likely to get roughly the same number of delegates from the four contests because of her overwhelming win in Louisiana. Alone, tonight\u2019s victory will give Sanders the majority of Maine\u2019s 25 delegates.",
        "Sunday\u2019s Democratic debate was notable not for who was onstage, but for who was in the audience. The debate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders took place in Flint, Michigan \u2014 a city whose water supply has been contaminated with shocking amounts of lead, where local officials dismissed and covered up the water problems, and where residents were lied to and ignored. Tonight, residents of Flint told Clinton and Sanders about their struggles with the water crisis, as well as preexisting issues from underemployment to public education, and demanded to know what they would do.",
        "Responding to a question about God and religion at the CNN Democratic debate on Sunday, Hillary Clinton gave a thoughtful answer on how prayer factors into her daily life. A woman named Denise, whose church services Clinton has apparently visited, asked Clinton to whom, and for whom, she prays. \u201dI have said many times that I am a praying person, and if I hadn\u2019t been during the time I was in the White House, I would have become one,\u201d Clinton said, to chuckles from the crowd.",
        "NATIONAL HARBOR, MD \u2014 For the University of Cincinnati\u2019s College Republicans, Donald Trump is very bad for the future of the party. The young conservatives say they already faced an uphill battle in trying to convince a mostly liberal campus that their views are not motivated by racism or homophobia. \u201dPeople will say, \u2018You\u2019re a bigot,\u2019 even when I didn\u2019t even mention anything about race,\u201d says Cameron Uptmor, 21, a member of the organization. Trump\u2019s rise has made this problem much more difficult to overcome.",
        "Last week the city council in Mountain View, California, took a significant step toward addressing Silicon Valley\u2019s housing affordability crisis. According to the Mountain View Voice, the city council \u201dlargely gave a \u201d to a new planning document for its North Bayshore district that envisions the creation of up to 10, 250 units of housing, though further review will be needed before the document is final. Mountain View only has about 32, 000 households total, so that would be a substantial 32 percent increase. The council\u2019s new direction is a victory for Google.",
        "Donald Trump as a major party presidential nominee seems so fundamentally unlikely that observers are ready to jump at any possible opportunity to proclaim his rise to power over. And the \u201dSuper Saturday\u201d results in Louisiana, Kentucky, Kansas, and especially Maine constitute a real disappointment for Trump relative to expectations. But make no mistake: He is still winning. A mildly disappointing evening for Trump was also a catastrophically disappointing evening for Marco Rubio, leaving the field more divided than ever. Ted Cruz remains a shrewd, politician, but he faces major structural weaknesses in his quest to overtake Trump.",
        "The US Supreme Court on Monday overturned, with no dissent, an Alabama Supreme Court ruling that denied a adoption. Richard Wolf reported the background for USA Today: The case was brought by \u201dV. L.,\u201d as she is identified in court papers, against her former partner \u201dE. L.,\u201d who gave birth to three children between while the couple was together. To win adoption rights for V. L. they established temporary residency in Georgia. Now that they have split, E. L. agreed with the Alabama Supreme Court, which ruled in September that Georgia mistakenly granted V. L. joint custody. E.",
        "Pharmaceutical companies will earn nearly $2 billion this year selling drugs that patients never take. These are expensive cancer drugs that can cost upward of $13, 000 per month. A new study suggests that the way drug companies package these intravenous drugs \u2014 in vials that contain way more medication than an average patient needs \u2014 ends up wasting a lot of money. \u201dWhat manufacturers are doing is they\u2019re not the vials to the dosages patients actually need,\u201d says study author Peter Bach, who is a physician at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.",
        "On Sunday, Last Week Tonight host John Oliver looked at special districts \u2014 a part of government you may not know exists even as it takes a big chunk of your tax dollars. So what are they? Special districts are small, local units of government set up to raise taxpayer dollars for a single purpose, such as a school or water district. Each year in the US, special districts spend about $100 billion.",
        "In a blistering speech whose prepared text Donald Trump\u2019s campaign leaked to Politico early Tuesday afternoon, the Republican candidate hammers free trade policies in terms starkly reminiscent of Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign. \u201dGlobalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very wealthy,\u201d says Trump. \u201dBut it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache.\u201d He says he\u2019ll bring back manufacturing jobs by renegotiating NAFTA, slapping China with punitive tariffs, and a range of other measures designed to put America First and make the country great again.",
        "If you\u2019ve ever asked who brought AIDS to the United States, you\u2019ve likely been told that \u201dPatient Zero\u201d was a man called Ga\u00ebtan Dugas. The Canadian flight attendant was blamed for carrying the virus from Africa and spreading it around the gay community in North America. Immortalized in books like Randy Shilts\u2019s And the Band Played On, Dugas also became central to the narrative at the time that the disease was spread by reckless, promiscuous men who have sex with men. People magazine featured Ga\u00ebtan Dugas as Patient Zero.",
        "Dyslexia is a learning disorder that makes it difficult to read. You may already know that, but it\u2019s hard to understand exactly what that means without experiencing the disorder yourself. Victor Widell, a developer, decided to make a simulation at his blog Geon. Here\u2019s what it looks like in GIF form (click here for the full simulation): This example doesn\u2019t necessarily apply to everyone with dyslexia, since it\u2019s a condition with a spectrum of more than one symptom.",

        "Ted Cruz is more interested in winning the Republican nomination than stopping Donald Trump from winning it. And that\u2019s very bad news for the strategy in Florida. Donald Trump is poised to win the Florida primary on March 15, giving him all 99 of the state\u2019s delegates in its primary. \u201dIf we win Florida, it\u2019s over,\u201d Trump said at a rally this weekend \u2014 and while this is coming from a man who reportedly doesn\u2019t know how delegates work, he\u2019s probably right. But there\u2019s one candidate who might be able to stop Trump and save the strategy: Marco Rubio.",
        "Bernie Sanders will face a crucial electoral test in Michigan on Tuesday. His performance there will either give him a path to challenging Hillary Clinton for the nomination or put his campaign on life support. \u201dIt\u2019s really crunch time for Sanders,\u201d says Kyle Kondik, of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. \u201dIf Sanders doesn\u2019t win Michigan, what would lead you to think he\u2019d win Illinois or Missouri or Ohio? If he\u2019s really going to challenge Clinton in this race, he needs to find some big states to win.\u201d Sanders\u2019s campaign has itself recognized Michigan as a critical battleground.",

On Wednesday morning (or Tuesday night if, like me, you\u2019re on the East Coast of the United States) the moon will pass between the sun and the Earth, projecting a total solar eclipse over portions of the Pacific. NASA has animated the path the eclipse will take in the video below (it looks like a space giant is aiming a laser over the surface of the Earth).

        "In late January, speaking in the Russian city of Stavropol, Vladimir Putin denounced Soviet Communist leader Vladimir Lenin for, as Putin put it, placing an \u201datomic bomb\u201d under the foundations of the Soviet Union by nationality policies that allowed the right to secede. Putin\u2019s comments might seem like a matter of arcane history, but they\u2019re not: They\u2019re part of a debate over the legacy of Lenin\u2019s revolution, which is itself actually about an unexpected challenger to Putin\u2019s government today: the Communist Party. Next year is the 100th anniversary of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution that brought Lenin to power.",
        "Almost 10 years after the release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final book in J. K.

        "Two years after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 lost contact with air traffic control and disappeared, investigators are not much closer to finding the missing plane \u2014 prolonging what has become perhaps the most vexing mystery in modern aviation history. The disappearance was commemorated in Malaysia with a moment of silence in the nation\u2019s parliament and a progress report on the investigation, which revealed frustratingly few new details on the state of the search.",
        "A wave of shootings and stabbings hit Israel in a stretch midday Tuesday. A stabbing in Jaffa, a section of Tel Aviv, killed at least one and wounded nine. A shooting in Jerusalem wounded two. And a stabbing in the city of Petah Tikva wounded one. (That assailant was subsequently killed, by the victim himself.) The identity of the attackers has not yet been revealed. However, since October there has been a wave of stabbings, shootings, and car attacks launched by individual Palestinians and Arab Israelis. Tuesday\u2019s attacks are consistent with this pattern.",
        "Children as young as 13 can get married in Virginia, if the girl is pregnant or the couple has parental permission. And since 2004, thousands of teenagers have gotten married in the state, including more than 200 who were 15 or younger. Nearly all of those married children were girls. The Virginia legislature just changed that, voting in favor of a bill that would require a judge\u2019s approval for anyone under age 18 to marry and forbidding marriage for teenagers under 16. It now goes to the governor\u2019s desk.",

        "When Full Frontal With Samantha Bee debuted on TBS in February, after months of speculation about what it might mean for Bee to be the lone woman anchoring a news show, its snarling theme song quickly made the host\u2019s intentions clear: You\u2019ve got them all by the balls, causing waterfalls, Stone walls, bar brawls, common stalls that cause \u2019em all.

        "1973 was a pretty grim year in the US. The Watergate scandal reached its peak. The Vietnam War entered its final throes. The turbulent cultural revolutions of the 1960s had everyone and exhausted.

The album was called America, Why I Love Her. Over simple backing tracks, Wayne \u2014 an actor and already a fixture in the American mythos \u2014 lends his raspy gravitas to 10 poems by John Mitchum."
