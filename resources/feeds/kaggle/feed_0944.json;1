        "Four more states headed to the polls Tuesday. Both parties have primaries in Michigan and Mississippi, and only Republicans are holding a primary in Idaho and caucuses in Hawaii. Now, tonight\u2019s results likely won\u2019t have massive delegate implications. But political junkies will be watching avidly to see what these states might tell us about next week\u2019s extremely consequential Republican contests. Is Donald Trump stumbling? Is Marco Rubio in free fall? Can Ted Cruz capitalize on his performance last Saturday? Here are the latest results: Mississippi primaries Democratic outcome: Hillary Clinton has beaten Sanders in a blowout.",
        "Leading in to the Michigan primary, Hillary Clinton rolled out a novel attack against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. He \u201dwas against the auto bailout,\u201d she said at the March 6 debate in Flint, Michigan. Later, and more precisely, she said he \u201dvoted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry.\u201d It didn\u2019t help Clinton carry the state, but as the campaign moves on to Ohio and other states with jobs the Clinton campaign says it will keep pressing the attack. Mook says Clinton will continue to make contrast on auto bailout.",
        "Welcome to Dear Julia, a column where readers submit everyday health questions. Which painkillers work best? Is it better to run or walk for exercise? Julia Belluz sifts through the research and consults with experts in the field to figure out how science can help us live happier and healthier lives. Dear Julia: Do fasting diets really work for weight loss? Over the past couple of decades, many diets have come in and out of fashion, from eating very little fat to eating more protein and fewer carbs to avoiding meat all together.",
        "Political Twitter fell all over itself mocking this article blaming Al Franken for the rise of Donald Trump. But I don\u2019t think the mockery is quite merited. Stripped of its provocative framing, the underlying argument is fairly standard \u2014 and, in a way, much more revealing. The piece, by Josh Kraushaar, doesn\u2019t actually blame Franken for the rise of Trump. It blames Obamacare. Franken only figures in because Obamacare couldn\u2019t have passed without 60 Democrats in the Senate and Franken was the last (and most famous) Democrat elected to the Senate before its passage.",
        "Teenage girls who live near a Planned Parenthood clinic are 16 percent less likely to drop out of high school, a new study finds. Lots of studies have found that teen moms are significantly less likely to graduate from high school than ; 30 percent of female dropouts cite \u201dpregnancy\u201d and \u201dparenthood\u201d as key reasons for discontinuing their education. This new research, published Wednesday in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology, looked at both Planned Parenthoods that provide abortions and those that do not.",
        "Maria Sharapova\u2019s tennis career has demanded attention. She burst onto the scene in 2004, blasting Serena Williams off Wimbledon\u2019s Centre Court with searing groundstrokes and a grunt that sounds like a peacock in distress. The beauty of Sharapova\u2019s game, when it\u2019s on, is that there\u2019s no need for surgical precision. When she\u2019s at her best, her tennis is complete, obliteration. The Siberian quickly assumed the role of tennis\u2019s glamour girl, and won the US Open two years later, in 2006. Two after that, in 2008, she once again played indomitable tennis and cruised to the Australian Open title.",
        "Ben Carson, anticlimactic bringer of dreams, officially dropped out of the presidential race on March 4. \u201dYou know, there\u2019s a lot of people who love me, they just won\u2019t vote for me,\u201d Carson told the crowd at CPAC [the Conservative Political Action Conference] treating them to one of the saddest combinations of words said during a presidential race. Carson\u2019s sleepy concession speech did not go unnoticed by Stephen Colbert, who decided to bid Carson farewell while once again reprising his impersonation of The Hunger Games\u2019 Caesar Flickerman (the character was played by Stanley Tucci in the film franchise).",
        "Bernie Sanders\u2019s political coalition \u2014 a mix of young, liberal, and independent voters \u2014 reasserted itself last night, boosting the Vermont senator to an unexpected win in Michigan, contradicting polls that had predicted a loss. Sanders made up part of that ground by winning over voters who said they decided within a week of casting ballots, according to CBS exit polls. But his lead among that group \u2014 7 percentage points \u2014 is not enough to explain the gulf in support Sanders was able to close.",
        "We\u2019ll never know what Clara Rockmore \u2014 commemorated in today\u2019s Google Doodle for being a pioneer in electronic music in the 1930s \u2014 would have thought of today\u2019s most popular musicians. But Diplo, Skrillex, and other electronic musicians should honor Rockmore for her mastery of the genre of music that has evolved into today\u2019s chart toppers. She would have turned 105 today. Rockmore, who immigrated to the United States from Russia in 1921, was a master of the theremin, an early electronic instrument played without any physical contact.",
        "A Florida jury granted famous wrestler Hulk Hogan $115 million in compensatory damages to be paid by Gawker, the news site that Hogan has accused of violating his privacy by publishing a video of him engaged in a sex act. An adverse verdict is what Gawker was expecting, and the company plans to appeal, but even if Gawker prevails the need to post a bond equivalent to the full total of damages ordered will be a major financial burden.",
        "It was only three days since the last Democratic debate, but Wednesday night\u2019s showdown in Miami might as well have been a whole new race. Since debating in Flint on Sunday night, Bernie Sanders had scored an upset victory in Michigan \u2014 a surprise win that\u2019s put Hillary Clinton on the defensive while emboldening Sanders. Clinton, addressing the results directly, noted that she won more votes and more delegates on Tuesday (thanks to her big win in Mississippi) even as she and Sanders split the states. It was a confident and accurate portrayal of the state of the race.",
        "In 2008, during an interview with Univision\u2019s Jorge Ramos, Barack Obama promised to introduce a comprehensive immigration reform bill during his first year as president. He did not do that. And his failure to keep that promise set off years of very testy relations between the Obama administration and immigration activists.",
        "One day after Cleveland Clinic doctors hailed the first uterine transplant in the US a success last month, the prestigious medical center said the operation had, in fact, failed. At the time, the doctors didn\u2019t reveal the cause. Now, the transplant recipient, a Texan named Lindsey McFarland, has shared the details of her experience. The cause of the sudden complication that caused her to have her new uterus removed was, she said, a simple yeast infection. McFarland\u2019s tragedy \u2014 after much fanfare \u2014 raises the question about whether it\u2019s really worth continuing with the operation at all.",
        "When people think of solar power, they tend to think of panels on rooftops. That kind of distributed solar power is the most visible, gets the most press, and, from the consumer perspective, has the most sex appeal. But the humble workhorse of solar power is the solar power plant, usually defined as a solar array larger than 5 megawatts. Solar power plants can consist in either photovoltaic (PV) panels or mirrors that focus sunlight on a fluid that boils and turns a turbine (\u201dconcentrating solar power,\u201d or CSP).",
        "On Thursday morning, the Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg published a essay on President Obama\u2019s foreign policy struggles, successes, and vision, and within about an hour \u2014 less time than you would think it takes to read the article itself \u2014 discussion in the foreign policy community had devolved into the umpteenth round of an important but narrower debate: Was the president right or wrong to decline a military intervention in Syria? It\u2019s a worthwhile debate, but one that has already been litigated in hundreds of .",
        "A Breitbart reporter has filed a criminal police report against Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager over an altercation at a recent campaign rally, the Independent Journal Review first reported. The reporter, Michelle Fields, has said she was bruised after being \u201dmanhandled\u201d by Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. The Jupiter, Florida, police department confirmed Friday that it has received a report about an \u201dalleged battery\u201d that occurred at Trump National earlier this week. Just in: Jupiter Police statement on investigation of \u201dalleged battery\u201d at \u201dTrump National\u201d on March 8: pic. twitter.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s victory speech on Tuesday for Michigan and Mississippi devolved into a bizarre infomercial about former and current Trump products that Mitt Romney had insulted. And while many of Trump\u2019s claims during the speech were (as usual) factually questionable, they did provide Stephen Colbert with a major insight. Colbert said on Wednesday\u2019s The Late Show: I think I know what\u2019s going on here. Donald is just insecure. I don\u2019t know if Trump even wants to be president. The guy just needs constant validation. That\u2019s clear. And isn\u2019t that what all of us want? Love?",
        "This week, Whole Foods announced that it is moving in the decidedly hip direction of offering fruits and vegetables to its customers. When it tests this new offering in a few stores in California, Whole Foods will join a handful of grocery stores around the country that have started experimenting with selling produce that looks \u2014 there\u2019s no way of getting around it \u2014 pretty gnarly.",
        "Five people were killed and three injured in a shooting at a backyard barbecue and house party in Wilkinsburg, a Pittsburgh suburb, late Wednesday night, according to local police. Local police said there were at least two shooters, and police are still searching for them, the Pittsburgh reported. Neighbors reported dozens of gunshots \u2014 one man said 26; another woman said the shooting continued for at least a minute. Police haven\u2019t said what the motive for the shooting was, nor have they identified suspects. Wilkinsburg is a relatively area. It had the murder rate in Allegheny County in 2012.",
        "Artificial intelligence just overcame a new hurdle: learning to play Go, a game thousands of times more complex than chess, well enough to beat the greatest human player at his own game. Twice. AlphaGo, an artificial intelligence system developed by Google DeepMind, is two games into a match with Lee Sedol, the world\u2019s best Go player. And so far, AlphaGo has won both games \u2014 meaning that if Sedol is going to triumph, he has to stage a quick comeback.",
        "Underground is a tense, exhilarating thriller. Its plot frequently twists and turns in sudden and devastating fashion, weaving in and out of storylines with an urgency that leaves your heart pounding. Characters are good, evil, and every shade of gray in between. Underground is also about slaves trying to escape from a plantation. Rating 4 That startling juxtaposition defines WGN\u2019s new drama series, which debuted Wednesday, March 9, and centers on a single plantation in Georgia, its owners, the black market surrounding capturing and selling runaway slaves, and the slaves who yearn to be free.",
        "Wednesday night\u2019s Democratic debate on Univision crystallized something important: The discussion on immigration within the Democratic Party is further to the left than it has ever been. But you wouldn\u2019t have picked that up simply from watching the messy, confusing Univision debate itself. And even if you did pick it up, it wouldn\u2019t tell you anything about whether Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders is the better candidate for Democratic voters who care about immigration. After several debates in which immigration was mentioned only briefly or not at all, the Univision debate was a huge missed opportunity.",
        "On Monday, March 7, the world awoke to another Kardashian Twitter feud, this time between Bette Midler, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, and Kim Kardashian. Shortly afterward, Vox\u2019s Alex dutifully explained the cause of the imbroglio. But for casual observers like me, it can be difficult to follow the connections and latest developments among the protagonists of any saga involving the extended Kardashian universe \u2014 especially given how frequently they seem to occur. Is model Gigi Hadid somehow related to Caitlyn Jenner? Is rapper Tyga still dating Kylie Jenner? Who is the target of Kanye West\u2019s latest tweetstorm?",
        "Debates are supposed to offer journalists and pundits a unique time to come together and snark on Twitter. After a debate last week with literal penis jokes, CNN\u2019s Republican debate on Thursday was \u2026 surprisingly disappointing for snark. The debate was substantive and focused on policy \u2014 not exactly ideal for Twitter jokes. Nonetheless, there were some good moments on Twitter. Here\u2019s a roundup of some of Vox\u2019s favorite tweets of the night, from the best zingers to the best takes.",
        "Hillary Clinton has a net favorable rating that is unprecedentedly bad for a major party presidential nominee. The good news for Democrats is that the Republican frontrunner, Donald Trump, does much worse on this score (as does Ted Cruz). So there\u2019s no need to panic. Still, as Barack Obama\u2019s approval rating drifts up in 2016 it\u2019s hard not to notice that the party isn\u2019t exactly fielding its strongest talent. Most Americans approve of the job Obama is doing as president.",
        "Not all produce is created equal. I got a first whiff of this truth as a teenager, traveling in Italy. I noticed the pasta sauces and watermelons there popped with much more flavor than those I was accustomed to in North America.",
        "Marco Rubio and John Kasich are both in danger of losing to Donald Trump in their home states on Tuesday. So on Friday morning, Rubio spokesperson Alex Conant made an unusual appeal during a CNN appearance \u2014 that Republicans should vote for Kasich in Ohio. \u201dIf you are a Republican primary voter in Ohio and you want to defeat Donald Trump, your best chance in Ohio is John Kasich,\u201d Conant said. He added, naturally, that the best chance to stop Trump in Florida would be by voting for Rubio.",
        "In an appearance on MSNBC Friday afternoon, Hillary Clinton found herself in a situation that called for her to say some nice things about the recently deceased former first lady Nancy Reagan, and she made the somewhat odd choice to highlight advocacy. According to Clinton, \u201dBecause of both President and Mrs. Reagan \u2014 in particular Mrs. Reagan \u2014 we started a national conversation.",
        "Women judge prostitution more harshly than men and are more likely to think it should be illegal, according to a new YouGov poll. The poll asked Americans about their attitudes toward sex work, including whether they have ever personally bought or sold sex. (If they\u2019re answering honestly, apparently 6 percent of both men and women have sold sex, while 12 percent of men and 1 percent of women have bought it.) A slight majority of men (51 percent) think working as a prostitute should be legal, while almost as many women (50 percent) think it should be illegal.",
        "Writing by women has traditionally been ignored for two reasons. When a woman writes the kind of piece that is celebrated by male critics as \u201dserious literature,\u201d she is told it is the kind of writing to which women are least suited and that she should avoid it at all costs, and her writing is dismissed on the grounds that it cannot possibly be as good as what a man might write."
