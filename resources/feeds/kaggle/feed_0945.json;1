        "On Wednesday, Rakeem Jones was being escorted out of a Donald Trump rally by security when John McGraw punched him in the face. Jones was protesting the rally, which is why he was being escorted out by security to begin with. McGraw was charged with the assault. But he was unrepentant. \u201dHe deserved it,\u201d McGraw told Inside Edition. \u201dThe next time we see him, we might have to kill him. We don\u2019t know who he is.",

        "As Americans brace to lose an hour of sleep this weekend, marking the beginning of daylight saving time, nearly a dozen states are considering abandoning the whole practice altogether. States like Alaska and Rhode Island are considering bills that would place them squarely in one time zone, without the hassle of falling back every November and springing forward every March. Right now only two states, Arizona and Hawaii, rebuff the practice.",
        "California\u2019s Senate just voted to raise the legal age to buy cigarettes and other tobacco products from 18 to 21, as part of a larger effort to crack down on harmful tobacco use in the state. If Gov. Jerry Brown signs the bill \u2014 which he is expected to do \u2014 California will become the second state, after Hawaii, to raise the age threshold for buying cigarettes. Across the country, more than 100 cities, including New York City and Boston, have also already done so.",
        "Donald Trump canceled a rally in Chicago tonight after thousands of protesters and supporters began confronting each other at the University of Illinois at Chicago pavilion, with both sides yelling at each other and clashing with police. Trump said he was afraid violence might erupt. Reports say 32 people were arrested and several injured during clashes earlier in the day at a Trump rally in St. Louis. But canceling the rally in Chicago produced a melee where protesters and supporters struggled with both each other and the police.",

        "During a rally in St. Louis Friday, Donald Trump lamented that \u201dnobody wants to hurt each other anymore.\u201d Yes, lamented. The topic was protesters, and Trump\u2019s frustration was clear. \u201dThey\u2019re being politically correct the way they take them out,\u201d he sighed. \u201dProtesters, they realize there are no consequences to protesting anymore. There used to be consequences. There are none anymore.\u201d \u201dOur country has to toughen up folks,\u201d he continued. \u201dWe have to toughen up. These people are bringing us down. They are bringing us down.",

        "On Friday, Hillary Clinton made a bizarre claim about Ronald and Nancy Reagan during the former first lady\u2019s funeral: that on they \u201dstarted a national conversation. When before nobody would talk about it, nobody wanted to do anything about it.\u201d This got the history, as we now know it, completely wrong. Through documents and reviews of the time period, we know the Reagan administration did not care much about until years into the epidemic \u2014 in large part because it was perceived as a disease that only afflicted gay people.",

        "Twitter is a valuable source of fascinating commentary, replete with links to important journalism and otter videos. Twitter is also a flaming chamber of unchecked gossip. At least, that\u2019s according to a newly published study in PLOS One. A team of researchers, led by computer scientist Arkaitz Zubiaga of the University of Warwick, wanted to track the life cycle of a social media rumor. To do this, they found a new way to analyze a randomly selected subset of more than 300 rumor threads (nearly 5, 000 tweets) associated with nine recent news stories. Their objective?",
        "On Friday night in Chicago, violence broke out between supporters and protesters at a Donald Trump rally, leading Trump to cancel the event. On Saturday, Trump blamed the protesters and \u201dthugs\u201d \u2014 a racially coded word \u2014 for the violence. But maybe Trump should blame himself. As Rachel Maddow demonstrated in a string of clips aired on MSNBC, Trump has consistently called for violence against protesters at his rallies.",

        "One of the biggest problems with daylight saving time is that for many of us with jobs, our sunrises and sunsets often occur at odd times. Some people hate waking up at 7 am for a and finding it\u2019s still dark out. Others find it sad to leave work at 5 pm amid total darkness. There are also major inequalities within individual time zones. New York City and Detroit are both in Eastern time. The sun will rise in Detroit at 7:28 am Friday.

A large collection of photos from the 19th and early 20th century is fraught with faces of doom and gloom \u2014 and occasionally a literal dead face. There are several theories for why people in early photographs were so solemn in front of a camera. One has to do with the camera itself.

        "Bernie Sanders\u2019s unexpectedly strong presidential campaign has drawn a great deal of attention to the small Northern European nation of Denmark (population 5. 6 million) which Sanders and many other liberals cite as a social democratic success story. In response to this clamor, Vox has produced a lot of great Denmark content, answering such questions as, \u201dWhat is a Denmark?\u201d I particularly like this account from a Dane. Missing, however, has been any love for one of Denmark\u2019s coolest features, namely it\u2019s progressive energy policies.",

Mushers and their sled dogs are now racing over 1, 100 miles from Anchorage to the finish line in Nome, a trip that typically takes anywhere from nine to 12 days, although it\u2019s hard to predict. The journey through the Alaska wilderness is trying for everyone involved. And as Alaska Public Media explains in this great video, sled dogs are not your average pets. They\u2019re super athletes trained to run thousands of miles. But winning isn\u2019t just about speed.",
        "I was a liberal Donald Trump apologist. Not a liberal enjoying the chaos Trump was sowing in the Republican Party, but someone who welcomed his ideological heterodoxy. It was a step away from the cliff of endless polarization that offered a more moderate substantive agenda than Marco Rubio\u2019s. I held on to that conviction through Friday\u2019s protest violence and Saturday\u2019s torrent of \u201denough is enough\u201d takes. I was wrong.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s rallies have a violence problem. But it\u2019s not a matter of fringe incidents or unwelcome hooligans tarnishing Trump\u2019s image. It\u2019s a problem that starts with Trump himself, that\u2019s been going on for a while, and that\u2019s getting worse. For the majority of Americans who are not Donald Trump supporters, the idea of a leading political candidate inciting violence against protesters \u2014 and being cheered for it \u2014 seems shocking. Where did this embrace of mob violence come from? Why does it seem that many of Trump\u2019s supporters not only tolerate but welcome and embrace his rhetoric?",
        "In 1998, psychologists found evidence of a tantalizing theory: We all have a finite mental store of energy for and . Resisting temptations, or making tough decisions, saps this energy over time. Willpower is like a muscle, the argument goes. When it\u2019s tired, we\u2019re less focused; we give in to temptation and make shoddy decisions that hurt us later. The original 1998 experiment used chocolate chip cookies, radishes, and an impossible quiz to elegantly illustrate this.",
        "Germany held regional elections on Sunday in three states, and the results were shocking. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which ran on a xenophobic, platform, won 12. 5 percent in the state of 15 percent in and 24 percent in . German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats and the Social Democratic Party, by contrast, lost considerable vote shares. AfD didn\u2019t win enough to control the government of any of the three states that voted, but it does now hold a significant presence in each state\u2019s legislature.",
        "I wrote last week that Bernie Sanders\u2019s campaign had changed my mind and convinced me that he is right to set college at public universities as the goal for higher education policy. But I also noted that I wasn\u2019t sold on the implementation details of his plan, and that in my experience Sanders enthusiasts were not especially aware of the content of his plan. principles are important, but implementation is important too. It\u2019s worth reading Sanders\u2019s actual plan, since not only is there a lot of nitpicking one could do but there\u2019s also an enormous glaring flaw.",
        "Over the past two decades, the internet has lowered barriers to entry in a wide variety of industries. As a result, institutions have seen their power \u2014 and in some cases their existence \u2014 threatened. In the book industry, Amazon has destroyed traditional booksellers. In the music industry, online services like iTunes and Pandora have undercut the power of traditional record labels. services like Uber and Lyft have undercut the power of traditional taxicab companies that once had a stranglehold on major urban markets. Now it\u2019s happening in the political system.",

        "Black women may be leading the overall charge among new owners, but a new report says that for black women in tech, it\u2019s not with the help of big investors. A new report by Digital Undivided surveyed 378 companies led by black women across the country, 88 of which qualified as startups. For those startups, data showed that in 2015, only 56 percent of the black women startup founders in the study raised outside funding. And they raised an average of only $36, 000.",
        "America\u2019s liberals finally have a candidate they can wholeheartedly root for in the Republican primaries \u2014 Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. There\u2019s been incredible temptation to root for Donald Trump, whose unfavorable ratings are and whose candidacy is tearing the conservative movement apart, but it\u2019s tempered by growing fear of what a Trump administration might actually look like. On the other hand, someone like a Marco Rubio is pretty scary in his own right, and much more likely to win a general election.",

After the bout of violence at Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Chicago on Friday, Rubio said, while referencing Trump\u2019s repeated calls at his rallies for his supporters to beat up protesters: I think we also have to look at the rhetoric coming from the frontrunner in the presidential campaign.",

        "Until recently, the existence of 10 Cloverfield Lane, produced by J. J. Abrams, was a closely guarded secret. Like its predecessor, the 2008 monster movie Cloverfield, the movie was produced entirely without fanfare or marketing. No plot details or character descriptions were leaked; there were no set photos, no interviews with stars, no advertisements or media of any kind. The release of 10 Cloverfield Lane wasn\u2019t announced at all until the middle of January, in a surprise trailer attached to 13 Hours, barely two months before its debut."
