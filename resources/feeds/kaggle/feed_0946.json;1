        "Just weeks ago, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich all affirmed a pledge to back Donald Trump if he emerged as the Republican nominee. But after violence broke out at several Trump rallies this weekend \u2014 with an event in Chicago shut down over safety concerns \u2014 the other candidates have begun to change their tune. Marco Rubio, who is perhaps the furthest from securing the nomination at this point, rebuked the frontrunner with his strongest criticisms to date. He said Trump has no excuse for inciting violence in response to anger.",
        "On Monday, Netflix dropped the trailer for the second season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, its colorful, cheeky sitcom starring Ellie Kemper as the titular character \u2014 an cult member finding her way in the big city. The trailer reveals that in season two, Kimmy gets a job at a Christmas store, which makes all kinds of sense and will allow Kemper to lean into Kimmy\u2019s manic earnestness. Having Kimmy in a Christmas store for a whole season of episodes could potentially be overkill, but her friends are back too. Mrs.",
        "If you can\u2019t get tickets to see Hamilton on Broadway \u2014 and chances are you can\u2019t \u2014 you\u2019re in luck. The original cast is currently at the White House, where they performed the \u201dAlexander Hamilton\u201d and \u201dMy Shot\u201d numbers from the musical \u2014 and the White House streamed it live on its website for anyone to watch.",
        "Measles and whooping cough, two infectious diseases US public health officials had gotten pretty good at preventing, have made a disturbing comeback in recent years. Why? Many believe the recent outbreaks were closely tied to people who refuse vaccinations for all kinds of reasons. And a new paper in JAMA confirms they\u2019re right. The study, led by researchers at Emory University in Atlanta, reviewed 18 studies that traced the immunization histories of the 1, 416 people (ages 2 weeks to 84 years) who were diagnosed with measles in the United States since 2000.",
        "I cannot believe that I am about to write the following sentence, but here goes: Donald Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for the presidency, is accusing Ted Cruz\u2019s father, Rafael Cruz, of being connected to John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination. \u201d[Ted Cruz\u2019s] father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald\u2019s being \u2014 you know, shot,\u201d Trump told Fox News on Tuesday. \u201dWhat is this, right prior to his being shot, and nobody even brings it up. They don\u2019t even talk about that.",
        "For the last six years, the Obama administration has been mulling a controversial plan to open up the Atlantic coast for oil and gas exploration. It seemed inevitable that some sort of drilling would eventually occur in this previously untouched region. Now that\u2019s all changed. In a surprise move Tuesday, the Department of Interior announced it would reverse its earlier proposal to allow oil and gas drilling off the coasts of Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia over the next five years. The moratorium will now stay in place through 2022.",
        "There were two but stunning upsets during the Super Tuesday II elections on March 15: Anita Alvarez lost her bid for reelection for state\u2019s attorney of Cook County, Illinois, and Tim McGinty lost his reelection bid for county prosecutor in Cuyahoga, County. At face value, Alvarez\u2019s loss to Kim Foxx, a fellow Democrat, and McGinty\u2019s loss to Michael O\u2019Malley, also a Democrat, may not seem like a huge deal. But both of the incumbents lost, in part, because the Black Lives Matter movement criticized them for mishandling and neglecting police shooting cases over the past few years.",
        "Over the past couple of years, Stanford John Ioannidis and several colleagues have been working on a paper that should make any nerd think twice about those tests of statistical significance that are now commonly perceived as a signal of a study\u2019s worth. Their paper, published today in JAMA, examines across 25 years of biomedical research. That involved doing some seriously impressive data crunching: The researchers analyzed more than 1. 6 million study abstracts and more than 385, 000 papers, all of which included .",
        "\u201dIf Donald Trump wins, that\u2019s it. I\u2019m moving to Canada.\u201d You\u2019ve probably heard someone say it out of exasperation or resignation. People say it every presidential election \u2014 and this election, the unprecedented WTFness of the Republican Party frontrunner has the idea of heading north on a lot of people\u2019s minds. How many people? More than a quarter of Americans, it turns out.",
        "Under federal law, marijuana and heroin are in the same legal regulatory category: Schedule 1. It\u2019s a surprising fact \u2014 one that\u2019s commonly cited by marijuana legalization advocates as a way to show how bizarre US drug policies can appear. But a new poll from Vox and Morning Consult shows that most Americans don\u2019t know that marijuana is in the same legal category as heroin \u2014 or, in fact, where other illicit drugs lie in the federal scheduling system.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s march to the nomination is up against a roadblock in Ohio: Kasichmentum. Gov. John Kasich, who barely registered in national polls for most of the primary, just beat Trump in his home state of Ohio, a state worth 66 delegates. It still puts Kasich behind Ted Cruz in the delegate count, which doesn\u2019t make for an easy path to victory. But winning the nomination at this point is not Kasich\u2019s primary goal.",
        "The danger of climate change does not arouse much public passion, certainly nothing like what the facts would warrant. This drives climate campaigners crazy. Always has. So how to get people\u2019s attention? One strategy might be to talk about climate change differently \u2014 to \u201dframe\u201d it differently, in the current jargon. Over the years, climate scientists, campaigners, and policymakers have returned to this strategy (or, rather, this hope) again and again. And again.",
        "For people who pay more attention to the screens above the court than the game below, the kiss cam is a highlight. It shows up at basketball, baseball, and hockey games, and it\u2019s a key part of arena entertainment. The above video shows how it all actually works \u2014 from the minutiae of the selection process to the business model that keeps the kiss cam running. The history of the kiss cam is surprisingly hazy \u2014 Alan Siegel at Deadspin wrote the best possible history of the segment, but it\u2019s hard to track down just who invented it.",
        "Sen. Ted Cruz reiterated a message he\u2019s been hammering home over the last few weeks: that he\u2019s the only remaining Republican candidate who has a chance of preventing Donald Trump from winning the nomination. \u201dNobody else has any mathematical possibility whatsoever. Only one campaign has beaten Donald Trump over and over and over again,\u201d Cruz said.",
        "The choice for both parties in the March 15 presidential primaries \u2014 held in Florida, Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina, and Missouri \u2014 was between chaos and conclusion. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump had the potential to all but wrap up their parties\u2019 nominations. Of course, even if Trump had swept every state, the GOP elite would still be brainstorming ways to deny him the nomination, but their schemes would\u2019ve gotten and more cartoonishly villainous.",
        "Marco Rubio lost his home state of Florida last night, and withdrew from presidential campaign. In his final speech, he warned Americans away from a politics of fear \u2014 decrying, in only thinly veiled language, the Trump campaign. \u201dI ask the American people: Do not give in to the fear,\u201d he said. \u201dWe are a hopeful people, and we have every right to be hopeful.\u201d While some candidates appealed to people\u2019s worst instincts, Rubio said, he appealed to their best.",
        "On Wednesday, March 16, President Obama nominated Chief Judge Merrick Garland of the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit to succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. In some ways, this is a totally predictable, normal nomination. Garland is a judge who\u2019s served for 19 years on the second most powerful court in America, winning plaudits from his liberal and conservative colleagues alike. Obama seriously considered him for two previous Supreme Court vacancies in 2009 and 2010.",
        "For foreign policy wonks, a interview with the sitting president on his foreign policy doctrine, like the one Jeffrey Goldberg published last week in the Atlantic, is a rare and delicious treat. We will be masticating it, in all of its glorious philosophical complexity, for months, probably years, to come.",
        "After Hillary Clinton posted major primary wins on Tuesday night, some male pundits seemed more concerned about her voice and appearance than anything else. MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough in particular got a lot of blowback for telling Hillary to \u201dsmile.\u201d Smile. You just had a big night. #PrimaryDay \u2014 Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) March 16, 2016 To the many women who deal with street harassment and the everyday double standards of how women \u201dshould\u201d talk or present themselves, it was a comment to make about the first female candidate with a good chance of winning the presidency.",
        "Zika has been spreading throughout the Western Hemisphere, carried mainly by a type of mosquito called Aedes aegypti. The virus is a major concern in countries such as Brazil, Venezuela, and El Salvador, and mosquitos have begun to transmit the virus locally in Puerto Rico. Zika isn\u2019t yet transmitting in mosquitoes the United States \u2014 all of the people with Zika here were infected while traveling or through sexual transmission. But the number of those cases is rising.",
        "Recently, a group of female scholars analyzed the New York Times\u2019s coverage of the presidential primary, looking at every article from March 2015 through January 2016. They found something striking: 80 percent of the political scientists quoted in those articles were men. And it\u2019s not just the Times: Male experts dominate media coverage. On primetime cable and Sunday news shows, for another example, 75 percent of national security and foreign affairs commentators have been men, according to a Media Matters for America study.",
        "A year and a half after massive protests in Ferguson, Missouri, reacting to the 2014 police shooting of Michael Brown, Ferguson on Tuesday approved an agreement with the federal government to reform the city\u2019s police department and court system. The agreement comes after Brown\u2019s death led to massive protests in Ferguson, helping give rise to the Black Lives Matter movement and its protests against racial disparities in the criminal justice system and police use of force. Justice Department and Ferguson negotiators tentatively agreed to policing reforms in January.",
        "Sometimes the most terrifying things come in beautiful packages. That\u2019s the premise of The Beauty, a gorgeous, shivery comic book from creators Jeremy Haun and Jason A. Hurley. Haun and Hurley drop readers into a disease outbreak that\u2019s already in motion, where the contagion that\u2019s spreading isn\u2019t a zombie virus or an unkillable superbug but an STD that turns its host beautiful. It burns their fat, chisels their jaws, and clears their skin. And because people are strange creatures, half the country is infected, with many people having contracted the disease on purpose. . . iframe, . object, .",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention was an emotional, historic moment for many. But some commentators also fixated on things like Clinton\u2019s voice, or whether she was smiling: Instead of lecturing 2 citizens @HillaryClinton needs 2 have conversation . Modulate voice. Tell stories. Set hopes.",
        "In 2012, the congressional scholars Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein wrote a column for the Washington Post diagnosing what they saw to be the central problem in modern American politics. \u201dThe GOP has become an insurgent outlier in American politics,\u201d they wrote. \u201dIt is ideologically extreme; scornful of compromise; unmoved by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition. \u201dWhen one party moves this far from the mainstream, it makes it nearly impossible for the political system to deal constructively with the country\u2019s challenges.\u201d The hit like a bomb.",
        "Venezuela\u2019s massive electricity crisis keeps getting worse and worse. This week, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro declared that every Friday for the next two months will be a national holiday, a desperate move to conserve power as water levels at the country\u2019s hydroelectric dams fall to perilously low levels. \u201dWe\u2019ll have long weekends,\u201d he said on state television, leaving people to ponder what this would mean for schools and stores. Venezuela\u2019s government has badly mismanaged the electric grid for years This came after Maduro had closed the entire country for five days during Easter holidays in March.",
        "St. Patrick\u2019s Day, celebrated every year on March 17, has become synonymous with shamrocks, the color green, pinching, (if perchance you\u2019ve forgotten to wear the color green) and plenty of alcohol imbibing. But the holiday, commemorated in today\u2019s green and Google Doodle, has a long, rich religious history. The tradition goes all the way back to St. Patrick, who is credited with bringing Catholicism to Ireland. For centuries, his memory was honored with a feast and a trip to church. How, then, did a holiday on the official Catholic calendar become associated with all the material trappings of modernity?",
        "On Sunday, a black undercover police officer came upon and engaged in a gun battle in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. Soon after, he was killed \u2014 not by one of the assailants who started the gunfight, but by a fellow police officer, Lynh Bui reported for the Washington Post. The terrible tragedy immediately brought up worries of racial bias: Did a police officer shoot the undercover, plainclothes cop during the tense gun battle because he was black?",
        "Last night was a devastating defeat for Marco Rubio, whose big losses in the Super Tuesday II primaries caused him to drop out of the Republican race. But the scale of the disaster is even bigger when we look at the amount of money Rubio and the Republican establishment spent in the past weeks to try to stop Trump. It shows that Trump is winning while spending incredibly little on any sort of advertising. Other candidates, like Rubio, went aggressive on advertising, only to have their efforts rebuffed by voters.",
        "You only need to look at popular TV shows to see how the American family is changing. From (virgin) mothers who have children out of wedlock to couples becoming commonplace, America is less conservative than ever about what it calls a family. But there is one specific way our views on marriage have become more conservative: New government data shows we are significantly less accepting of divorce than we were a decade ago. This is according to a survey the government runs every few years called the National Survey of Family Growth."
