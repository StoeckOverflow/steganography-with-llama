        "Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is turning toward the general election, and away from loyal campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. In a statement Monday, Trump\u2019s spokesperson Hope Hicks said Lewandowski will \u201dno longer be working with the campaign.\u201d \u201dThe campaign is grateful to Corey for his hard work and dedication and we wish him the best in the future,\u201d Hicks said in the statement. It\u2019s a big shift from the primaries for the presumptive Republican nominee. Tensions have mounted in the Trump campaign since the candidate secured the number of delegates to become the presumptive nominee.",
        "Chicago\u2019s City Council voted unanimously yesterday to get rid of the sales tax on tampons and pads, becoming one of the first major US cities to do so. The council voted to reclassify the feminine hygiene products as \u201dmedical necessities,\u201d exempting them from taxation. Right now they are subject to a 10. 25 percent sales tax, a combination of city and state taxes. The vote will only remove Chicago\u2019s portion of that tax, which is a modest 1. 25 percent. Removing the rest of the sales tax would require action at the state level.",
        "The food revolution is underway The food revolution is underway. This feels like a victory for Britain\u2019s children and for everyone who has campaigned so hard for a tax on sugary sweetened drinks. I would love the money to go to food education as well as sport but I think we have to applaud the Chancellor for taking this extremely important, bold step. I hope that this bravery will continue to form a part of this Government\u2019s attitude to dealing with obesity and will influence the Prime Minister\u2019s Childhood Obesity strategy later in the year.",
        "\u201dTo say that there is not enough money is just a lie.

        "Wednesday was a rough day for two of the biggest public transit systems in the US. First, the Washington, DC, Metro shut down its train service for 29 hours Wednesday for safety inspections. Then on Wednesday night, electrical problems caused delays on the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) network. And when BART customers complained on Twitter about yet another delay, the people behind the system\u2019s Twitter account started getting real. Rather than a cheerful, anodyne apology for the delay and a promise to do better, they detailed the systemic problems afflicting mass transit in the Bay Area and elsewhere.",
        "In her continuing efforts to reach out to America\u2019s #youth, Hillary Clinton stopped by Comedy Central\u2019s Broad City on Wednesday to bask in some serious female empowerment.

        "A lot of cool stuff has happened in Austin, Texas, in the past week. South by Southwest, a festival, attracts thousands of innovators \u2014 and the projects they want to show off to one another \u2014 from around the world. This year, one venture, and its accompanying documentary series debut, really stood out (to me, anyway): the Google Lunar XPrize.

        "Whenever conservation ecologist Joe Roman conducts fieldwork in Cuba, he\u2019s in awe of the place. Diving off the costal waters is a treat compared with other spots in the Caribbean. \u201dThe first things you notice there is how abundant the fish populations are,\u201d he says. Much of the rest of the sea has been overfished, leaving the reefs more barren. On land, too, are signs of relatively little human activity. \u201dThe tropical dry forest there is in better shape than most of the Caribbean,\u201d he says.",
        "On Wednesday, something surprising and strange happened in Brazil: The president, Dilma Rousseff, appointed former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, her political mentor, to her own Cabinet. That same day, a Brazilian judge ordered the government to release a wiretap recording of Rousseff \u2014 yes, the government is listening in on its own president \u2014 speaking to Lula, as he\u2019s commonly known. The recording seemed to reveal that Rousseff had appointed Lula to save him from prosecution in a corruption scandalinvolving the oil company Petrobras.",
        "While the official organs of progressive politics have been broadly supportive of Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination to serve on the Supreme Court, privately Washington is full of complaints. Garland is both older and less liberal than other potential choices, and it seems very likely that Republicans will block him anyway. Hasn\u2019t Obama learned that this accommodationist strategy didn\u2019t work for him in 2010 and 2011, while a turn in his second term produced results?",
        "Daredevil, Marvel\u2019s first Netflix superhero show, was an acclaimed hit that made a name for itself with flashy fight scenes and a morose exploration of justice in a city riddled with crime and inescapable violence. The show\u2019s second season is sticking to its strengths with new, bloodthirsty characters, a plot involving the trial of the century, and the yakuza (or a group that says it\u2019s the yakuza) Irish gangsters, and violent bikers itching for a gorgeous fight scene or three.",
        "There was once a time when most Americans took streetcars to work every day. Nowadays, 85 percent of workers drive. And although a few different factors fueled this transition, the biggest one may have been a $425 billion investment over half a century in the world\u2019s most advanced network of highways: the Interstate Highway System. The 48, 000 miles of interstate highway that would be paved across the country during the 1950s, \u201960s, and \u201970s were a godsend for many rural communities.",
        "Let the Parm rain down. (Washington ) Like every kid growing up, I thought my grandmother was the best cook in the world. Eventually, I learned that one of her kitchen secrets involved throwing Parmesan cheese into just about everything she made. She\u2019d stir fat granules of the salty cow\u2019s cheese into the potato dough that made gnocchi or whip it into scrambled eggs. Parmesan even found a place in her mouthwatering Thanksgiving stuffing. Great cooks everywhere have long marveled at Parmesan\u2019s ability to add complexity and flavor to myriad dishes, from vegetable broths to chicken to hamburgers.",
        "Sea World is going to stop breeding killer whales in captivity, NPR reports. The announcement comes after years of public scrutiny, especially since the release of the documentary film Blackfish. In a joint announcement with the Humane Society, the theme park owner has succumbed to the pressure. But why is captive breeding so bad, and what does this mean for SeaWorld going forward?",
        "If Cassidy Sokolis ever needs to wake up before 11 am, she scatters three alarm clocks throughout her bedroom. Even then, she still often sleeps through the clamor. \u201dIt\u2019s really frustrating,\u201d Sokolis, a junior at Northern Arizona University, tells me. \u201dPeople have mocked me for it, saying how lazy I am, that I\u2019m not trying hard enough. That really bothers me. Because it\u2019s my brain\u2019s fault, not mine.\u201d A college student would say that. But her doctors say it isn\u2019t just an excuse.",
        "Liberal groups, including Bernie Sanders supporters, are planning to turn their collective fire and cash on the leading contender to be the Republican nominee, Donald Trump. The Wall Street Journal reports that a coalition of 22 liberal groups, including some that backed Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary, are already coordinating an Trump strategy: A coalition of 22 liberal groups including some that have endorsed Mrs. Clinton and others that back her Democratic rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders have united behind a campaign to stop Mr. Trump.",
        "Why are Republicans obstructing President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court? According to The Daily Show\u2019s Trevor Noah, no good reason. The actual reason, of course, is that they say the president shouldn\u2019t pick a nominee on an election year, when the next president could have a totally different view on who Antonin Scalia\u2019s replacement should be. As Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, put it, \u201dEven if you picked me, Lindsey Graham, I would lead the charge against me, because you [Obama] were the one who picked me in an election year.\u201d Noah wasn\u2019t buying it.",
        "For years now, a defining assumption of the 2016 race has been that the House Republican majority is fundamentally not on the ballot. But thanks to Donald Trump, one of the leading House election analysts in America says it may be time to reconsider that assumption. Folks, it may be time to rethink whether the House could be in play in 2016. https: . @CookPolitical \u2014 Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) March 18, 2016 Dave Wasserman is the US House editor of the Cook Political Report, the gold standard for granular analysis of congressional races.",
        "A man and his boyfriend in Atlanta spent 10 days and nearly one month in a hospital, respectively, after another man, Martin Blackwell, poured boiling hot water on them, allegedly because of their sexual orientation. And on Wednesday, a jury found Blackwell guilty of eight counts of aggravated battery and two counts of aggravated assault, Cleve Wootson reported for the Washington Post. Blackwell was sentenced to 40 years in prison.

The episode of the week for March 13 through 19 is \u201dGateway,\u201d the finale of the first season of USA\u2019s Colony. The reason I love USA\u2019s alien invasion drama Colony is also the reason I will eventually turn on it.

        "In the first presidential election following President Barack Obama\u2019s two terms in office, both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are trying to galvanize support from Obama\u2019s multicultural coalition, including black voters. So far, Clinton has been the undisputed winner among black voters in each of the Democratic primaries. But the margins of difference between black Clinton supporters and black Sanders voters vary across the country, with Clinton outperforming Sanders by much larger margins in Southern states than Midwestern ones. The differences seem to be regional, but is it that simple?",
        "A Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump general election campaign offers the perfect circumstances for national Democrats to run on a relatively centrist, relatively economic message. But Clinton might be the last Democrat to pull it off. Bernie Sanders\u2019s insurgency is fizzling out, but the economic policy consensus that dominated the administrations of Barack Obama and Bill Clinton now rests on surprisingly shaky electoral foundations. Not only is Clinton relying on older voters to beat Sanders, she\u2019s relying specifically on votes and the institutional support of labor unions.",
        "If a Walking zombie outbreak ever swept across the United States, your best bet would be to head for the northern Rockies. That\u2019s one upshot of some fun 2015 research by Alex Alemi, Matthew Bierbaum, Christopher Myers, and James Sethna of Cornell University. After reading World War Z, the group wanted to figure out how a zombie apocalypse might play out in the United States. So they did the natural thing and modeled it. They\u2019ve even created a zombie simulator that lets you see for yourself how the invasion would spread, based on different assumptions. Try it!",
        "Donald Trump is scheduled to address the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the nation\u2019s leading group, Monday evening. And, as with all Trump appearances, anything could happen. Trump\u2019s speech is at 5 pm Eastern at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, DC, and will be streaming live on AIPAC\u2019s website. Nearly all the presidential candidates are speaking at AIPAC (Bernie Sanders was the only candidate to turn down the offer to speak) but all eyes will be on Trump, the Republican presidential frontrunner, who has a record of contradictory statements on Israel.",
        "For decades, tennis has been one of athletics\u2019 greatest gender equalizers. Women tennis players win the same prize money as their male counterparts. Their athletic achievements rival the men, and they earn more money, endorsements, and notoriety than all other female athletes. So when the chief executive of the Indian Wells tournament, Raymond Moore, said women tennis players ride on the \u201dcoattails of the men,\u201d it rightfully turned some heads. \u201dThey don\u2019t make any decisions and they are lucky. They are very, very lucky.",
        "Two comets will make an incredibly close pass to Earth this week. And while NASA\u2019s official word is that they pose no threat to civilization (hurray!) their offers astronomers a rare chance to study the cosmic ice balls up close. The closer (and smaller) of the two \u2014 a comet with the unsexy name BA14 \u2014 will pass 2. 2 million miles from Earth on March 22.

        "An Trump Super PAC is running ads to try to convince Mormons not to vote for Trump \u2014 by his wife, Melania. And Trump hit back Tuesday night with a bizarre tweet vaguely threatening Cruz\u2019s wife: Lyin\u2019 Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G. Q. shoot in his ad.

        "By now, plenty of people are familiar with fossil fuel subsidies \u2014 the hundreds of billions that governments spend to bankroll the burning of oil, gas, and coal. We\u2019ve also heard plenty about farm subsidies that can promote unhealthy food or destructive practices. Scaling back these programs has been a major priority of reformers over the years. Now we can add another b\u00eate noire to the list: fishing subsidies. A recent paper in Marine Policy estimates that governments spend more than $35 billion a year to subsidize fishing activities worldwide.",
        "As the Kremlin oversees its drawdown of Russian forces from Syria with every evidence of satisfaction, there is an inevitable Western concern that Russia will gain a taste for military interventions. In practice, though, the Syrian case was an outlier, and if it does lead to a shift in Russian policy it might, strange as it may sound, be to the West\u2019s advantage. Vladimir Putin certainly has grounds to be happy with his Syrian intervention (so far, at least). The initial deployment and the announcement of the partial withdrawal both caught the West entirely by surprise."
