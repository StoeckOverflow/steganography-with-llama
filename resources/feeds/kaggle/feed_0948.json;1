        "For all its problems and setbacks over the years, nuclear power has long been broadly popular in the United States. But there are signs that may be changing. A new Gallup poll finds that, for the first time since the survey began, a majority of Americans are opposed to nuclear energy \u2014 a source that still provides 19 percent of the nation\u2019s electricity: This doesn\u2019t seem to be driven by radiation fears or safety concerns.",
        "Apple CEO Tim Cook opened a much anticipated company event to announce the new iPhone with a few words on the company\u2019s fight in cybersecurity. \u201dWe did not expect to be in this position \u2014 at odds with our own government,\u201d Cook said. \u201dBut we believe strongly that we have a responsibility to help you protect your data and your privacy. We owe it to our customers and we owe it to our country.",
        "On the scale of science fiction \u2014 and YA movie franchises, the Divergent series hangs somewhere in the middle, a few rungs above The Maze Runner and The Mortal Instruments and an extension ladder below its closest relative, The Hunger Games. The latest entry, The Divergent Series: Allegiant, opened to dismal reviews and weak box office numbers relative to its predecessors.",
        "Over the weekend, the New York Times gave America the latest entry in the tired genre of freaking out about millennials with a piece titled, \u201dWhat Happens When Millennials Run the Workplace?\u201d It was a wonderful example of the genre, with an entire age group defined in broad generalizations based on anecdotes from a single workplace. But there\u2019s just one problem: Millennials don\u2019t exist. Obviously, young people who fit in the common definition of millennials do, indeed, exist.",
        "Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders all notched victories in Tuesday\u2019s primaries and caucuses in Arizona, Utah, and Idaho. But Trump and Sanders came out ahead, ending the night having picked up the most delegates in their quest for their parties\u2019 nominations. Trump and Cruz split the two Republican contests \u2014 Trump won big in Arizona and Cruz won bigger in Utah. But Trump ends the night expanding his delegate lead, since both states ended up being and Arizona is the larger state.",
        "The field of psychology is in the middle of a painful, deeply humbling period of introspection. psychological theories are failing replication tests, forcing researchers to question the strength of their methods and the institutions that underlie them. Take Joseph Hilgard, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania. In a recent blog post titled \u201dI was wrong,\u201d he fesses up to adding a shoddy conclusion to the psychological literature (with the help of colleagues) while he was a graduate student at the University of Missouri. \u201d[W]e ran a study, and the study told us nothing was going on,\u201d he writes.",
        "Since last November, more than 50 people in Wisconsin have been sickened by mysterious bacteria called Elizabethkingia anophelis. This is the largest recorded outbreak caused by what\u2019s to date been a rare microbe \u2014 and the same bug was identified last week in a patient who died in Michigan. Public health officials in both states don\u2019t yet know what sparked the outbreaks or how people became infected, but they\u2019re worried. So far, 18 people have died from the infection, and researchers believe this particular strain is resistant to many of the antibiotics that could stop it.",
        "Bernie Sanders is likely to start racking up a series of victories over the next two to three weeks as the Democratic primary heads out West. The big problem for Sanders is that many of the states where he is expected to do well are small. So while his supporters might be thrilled to see him on a hot streak, it\u2019s unlikely that even substantial wins will do much to change the underlying math of the race.",
        "Samantha Bee accused states of auditioning for Hoarders: Rape Kit Edition on Monday, with a scorching Full Frontal segment on the 400, 000 rape kits that are sitting untested in police evidence rooms across the country. Most rapists are serial offenders, Bee pointed out, not \u201dcollege boys who were confused about consent that one time\u201d \u2014 and testing rape kits can connect the dots between cold cases and bring those offenders to justice.",
        "President Obama will make a statement shortly from Havana, Cuba, on the attacks in Brussels this morning that killed at least 30 people and injured nearly 200. You can watch his remarks below. They\u2019re scheduled to start at 10:10 am Eastern time:",
        "The war on drugs: Is it a genuine public health crusade or an attempt to carry out what author Michelle Alexander characterizes as \u201dthe New Jim Crow\u201d? A new report by Dan Baum for Harper\u2019s Magazine suggests the latter. Specifically, Baum refers to a quote from John Ehrlichman, who served as domestic policy chief for President Richard Nixon when the administration declared its war on drugs in 1971.",
        "Some of the world\u2019s most important farming regions rely on freshwater from large underground aquifers that have filled up slowly over thousands of years. Think of the Central Valley aquifer system in California. Or the Indus basin in Pakistan and India. This groundwater is particularly valuable when rain is scarce or during droughts. But that groundwater may not last forever. Data from NASA\u2019s Grace satellites suggests that 13 of the world\u2019s 37 biggest aquifers are being seriously depleted by irrigation and other uses much faster than they can be recharged by rain or runoff.",
        "There are really only a few basic habits we know should help keep people healthy: eating well, exercising, avoiding smoking, and keeping body fat in check. Turns out a shockingly tiny number \u2014 just 2. 7 percent \u2014 of Americans actually manage all four habits, according to a new study published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings. The research, led by Paul Loprinzi of the University of Mississippi, used data about the lifestyles of nearly 5, 000 US adults from the 2003 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.",

        "Vice presidential candidate turned national sideshow Sarah Palin is reportedly developing a new unscripted series in which she would \u201dpreside over a planned reality court show.\u201d That\u2019s right: Sarah Palin wants to be your next Judge Judy. According to People \u2014 which cites a \u201dsource close to the process\u201d \u2014 the production company Warm Springs is working to bring Judge Palin to your daytime television schedule by fall 2017. As described, the project sounds like a fairly typical daytime court show: Palin would preside over a courtroom while people argue their cases for her inevitable judgment.",

        "The darkest moment of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is a montage of Bruce Wayne, played by an emotive rectangle of muscle and tendons known as Ben Affleck, prepping for his Superman fight by doing CrossFit. Rating 2 The sequence takes place in the Batcave to ostensibly camouflage the sound of Wayne\u2019s weighted pullups and the percussion of steel weights dropped over and over. Wayne pushes a resistance sled \u2014 the kind you see in football movies like The Blind Side \u2014 and then swings a sledgehammer at a few tires.",
        "In the summer of 2015, as NASA\u2019s Dawn spacecraft approached the dwarf planet Ceres, scientists kept seeing a pair of bizarre shiny dots peering back: What the heck were those things? Some experts initially thought they might be ice. Others speculated ice volcanoes. Many internet commenters joked that Ceres was secretly the Death Star. Eventually, scientists concluded that the shine was probably due to some sort of salty substance reflecting light from the surface. Now they\u2019ve gotten an even closer look.",
        "With support from Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and the legislature, North Carolina on Thursday passed what supporters brandished as a \u201drepeal\u201d of HB2, the state\u2019s law. But LGBTQ advocates are furious, arguing that the deal falls far short of the full repeal they were hoping for. To understand why, let\u2019s back up. HB2 had two major parts: It overturned and banned local statutes that protect LGBTQ people from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.",
        "Paul Ryan is speaker of the House of Representatives and the de facto leader of the Republican Party. He is liked by all factions, has national name recognition, and will be the chair of the 2016 Republican Convention in Cleveland, where he would play a key role in any contested convention scenario that stops Donald Trump. So when he announced that he would be giving a speech on \u201dthe state of American politics\u201d on Wednesday morning, many of us expected he was going to address the elephant in the room. He did not.",
        "Ten days before Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia unexpectedly passed away in February, Chief Justice John Roberts delivered some harsh criticism about the Court\u2019s confirmation process. He said the Senate should only assess whether nominees to the high court are sufficiently qualified and leave politics out of their consideration, according to the New York Times\u2019s Adam Liptak.",

All three were Belgian citizens. [Vox Libby Nelson] Laachraoui is suspected to have been the bombmaker for the Paris attacks in November. That makes his suicide unusual: Bombmakers are usually too valuable to a terrorist operation to blow themselves up.",
        "North Carolina just passed a combination of some of the most extreme measures in the US. Following Charlotte\u2019s decision to ban discrimination against LGBTQ people in some settings, North Carolina\u2019s Republican governor and Republican members of the legislature said they would overturn the local ordinance. On Wednesday, the legislature passed a bill that does just that, and Gov. Pat McCrory signed it into law \u2014 all within 24 hours.",
        "In the wake of Tuesday\u2019s terrorist attack in Brussels, Ted Cruz has called for police to \u201dpatrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods\u201d in order to prevent future attacks. \u201dIf you have a neighborhood where there\u2019s a high level of gang activity, the way to prevent it is you increase the law enforcement presence there and you target the gang members to get them off the streets,\u201d the GOP presidential candidate told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper.",
        "Comedian and actor Garry Shandling died on Thursday in Los Angeles. He was 66. Though Shandling starred in numerous films and was both for his standup and his awards show hosting gigs, his greatest legacy was in television, where he was instrumental in two of the best TV comedies ever made: Showtime\u2019s It\u2019s Garry Shandling\u2019s Show and HBO\u2019s The Larry Sanders Show. It\u2019s Garry Shandling\u2019s Show is remarkable for the way it blew apart the fake structure of the \u201980s family sitcom, exposing the weakest parts of that fa\u00e7ade (especially in its theme song) and poking fun at them.",
        "There\u2019s good news and gloomy news on climate change in this new report on renewable energy from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. First, the celebratory stuff. Renewable energy \u2014 mostly wind and solar, plus a little geothermal and biomass \u2014 is growing at a record pace. Last year, the world\u2019s nations plunked down $286 billion on renewable energy, twice what they spent on coal and gas. For the first time ever, renewables made up fully half of all new electric capacity, with 118 gigawatts coming online. Next time someone scoffs that renewables are a niche market, toss them this PDF.",
        "Economist Jay Zagorsky recently set out to debunk a dumb myth: that blond women are not as smart as the rest of the population. He found a large database of randomly sampled adults that contained information on both hair color and intelligence. He crunched some numbers \u2014 and got an astounding answer. \u201dAmong white women, those reporting having blond hair are actually slightly smarter than those with other hair colors,\u201d he writes in a new paper published in the Economic Bulletin, an open access journal.",
        "The last two decades have been grim for the monarch butterfly. There used to be more than a billion monarchs fluttering up from Mexico each spring to lay eggs on milkweed plants across North America. But as we\u2019ve eradicated those native milkweeds with farming, mowing, and herbicide spraying, butterfly numbers have collapsed 84 percent since 1995. Things have gotten so dire that a new study in Scientific Reports warns the Eastern migratory population of monarchs could dwindle to in just 20 years.",
        "It took 15 hours for Twitter to teach an artificially intelligent chatbot to be a racist, sexist monster. If you\u2019re shocked, you probably don\u2019t spend much time on Twitter. Microsoft\u2019s programmers presumably do, though, and the shocking thing is that they didn\u2019t see this coming. Microsoft created a chatbot named Tay that was designed to talk like a millennial and learn more authentic conversation by interacting with humans online. Tay was dubbed by her creators as an \u201dAI fam from the internet that\u2019s got zero chill!\u201d (Oh boy.) Some of Tay\u2019s interactions might actually pass a millennial Turing test.",
        "It\u2019s that time again \u2014 Donald Trump is at the center of a firestorm, and some GOP elites are speculating about blocking his nomination, according to a new report by Jon Ward of Yahoo! News. But wait, you say \u2014 hasn\u2019t Trump already locked up the majority of delegates he needs to win? Indeed he has. All along, though, there\u2019s been a \u201dnuclear option\u201d that could deny him the nomination nevertheless."
