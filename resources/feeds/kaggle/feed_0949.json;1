        "To date, solar power has mostly been available to utilities (as big power plants) or individual home and business owners (as rooftop panels). Left out has been . .. well, everyone else, those of us who are not utility executives and do not have the money, wherewithal, or suitable rooftops to install solar ourselves. That\u2019s a lot of people who love solar power but have no way to get directly involved in it. Happily, that situation is rapidly changing, thanks to the growth of shared solar.",
        "Even defenders of Netflix\u2019s Marvel shows, Daredevil and Jessica Jones, will admit they have one big problem \u2014 their stories tend to get really saggy in the middle. This was particularly true with Jones, which reached a climactic point around the middle of its first season, then screwed around for several episodes before staging its final battle. By the time Jessica faced off with the season\u2019s main supervillain, their encounter didn\u2019t nearly have as much potency as it would have if the season had run for only eight episodes instead of 13.",
        "Where did Donald Trump come from? It\u2019s a question Republicans have been asking themselves as the billionaire mogul dominates the party\u2019s presidential race. The Daily Show\u2019s Trevor Noah has a simple answer: Trump is the candidate the party created. While they may not realize it, Trump is the perfect match for much of what Republicans have been preaching over the years. \u201dYou can deny it all you want, but you can\u2019t mess with destiny,\u201d Noah said.",
        "Following Defense Secretary Ash Carter\u2019s announcement in December that women will now be able to join all ground combat units, the Marine Corps \u2014 the branch most opposed to the change \u2014 will now put all Marines through unconscious bias training to help adjust to the change. The rollout, scheduled for this May and June, is set to take place before the first riflewoman heads to boot camp. Training teams will be dispatched across the globe to offer a course to majors and lieutenant colonels, who in turn will train the Marines under them.",
        "After Ted Cruz called for a program to \u201dpatrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods\u201d \u2014 an idea immediately condemned as unconstitutional and ineffective \u2014 Muslims on Twitter responded with the hashtag #MyMuslimNeighborhood, a way to push back against the idea that \u201dMuslim neighborhoods\u201d either exist or pose any kind of threat. Some used it to demonstrate how a Muslim neighborhood is just an American neighborhood: In #MyMuslimNeighborhood the firemen live next door to us with a dog named \u2019Freckles\u2019 & the police academy is down the street.",
        "President Obama and the first lady hit the dance floor after a state dinner in Argentina in their honor Wednesday night, trying out the tango with professional dancers performing at the event. Getting Obama onto the dance floor took some convincing, Juliet Eilperin, a Washington Post reporter traveling with the president, wrote: He tried to wave away the professional tango dancer who beckoned him to come and join. But he eventually did \u2014 although the video suggests Michelle Obama danced with a little more gusto.",
        "This week, the two leading Republican presidential candidates spiraled into a hypermasculine feud over each other\u2019s wives. Donald Trump responded to an attack ad in support of Ted Cruz that used a nude photo of Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, with a vague threat to \u201dspill the beans\u201d about Cruz\u2019s wife, Heidi. The Facebook attack ad, targeted at Utah\u2019s conservative Mormon base before Tuesday\u2019s primary, was sponsored by Make America Awesome, a Super PAC supporting Cruz. It used a photo from a GQ spread with the caption, \u201dMeet Melania Trump. Your Next First Lady.",
        "One of the biggest public health wins of recent decades has been America\u2019s slow shift away from soda. With more awareness about the very strong correlation between guzzling sweet, fizzy drinks, and obesity and tooth decay, sales of beverages like and Pepsi have slumped. But there\u2019s pretty good evidence that Americans are still getting hoodwinked by juices and other sugary beverages. \u201dCola\u201d refers to both and cola carbonates. \u201dJuice\u201d covers all packaged juices from fruits or vegetables, including 100% juice, nectars ( % juice content) juice drinks (up to 24% juice content) and drinks (no juice content).",
        "On the heels of North Carolina passing its own sweeping law, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal announced that he will veto a religious freedom measure \u2014 one that critics argued could allow the same kind of discrimination in Georgia as North Carolina\u2019s law. The bill was recently passed by the legislature. But Deal was under intense pressure to veto the legislation, particularly from Hollywood businesses that have made Georgia into a hotspot for filming due to lucrative tax incentives.",
        "The presidential candidates have wildly varying tax proposals. Donald Trump and Ted Cruz propose massive cuts that would greatly reduce federal income taxes on everyone, especially the wealthy, while cutting a wide host of government programs. Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders proposes virtually the opposite: tax increases on everyone, with hikes on the wealthy especially, while adding comprehensive government programs. And Hillary Clinton proposes much smaller tax increases, all focused on the rich. But what do their plans mean for your federal tax liability?",
        "Some commentators love to nitpick Hillary Clinton\u2019s tone and appearance on the campaign trail, whether it\u2019s telling her to \u201dsmile\u201d more or to stop \u201dshouting.\u201d And other commentators point out that these kinds of remarks are sexist \u2014 a man would probably never get the same comments, and Clinton seems to be held to a double standard in which even if she tried to follow critics\u2019 advice, they\u2019d find something else to nitpick.",
        "A mudslinging, contretemps; US kills ISIS * (*yes, again); a surprisingly consequential Russian tax policy. Vox Sentences is written by Dylan Matthews and Dara Lind. TOP NEWS Take the GOP wives, please Alex Images The Republican presidential primary has, predictably, devolved into people flinging mud at Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, the two remaining credible candidates. [Vox Matt Yglesias] The contretemps started earlier this week when, on the eve of the Utah primary, an PAC ran a Facebook ad that used old nude photos of Melania Trump to cast the potential first lady in an unflattering light.",
        "Today is a religious rarity that will not occur again in our lifetimes. For most Christians in the West, it is Good Friday, the day of Jesus\u2019s crucifixion. It is also March 25, the traditional day of observing the Annunciation, when the angel Gabriel came to Mary and told her she would become pregnant with Jesus. This overlap has happened just three times in the 20th century (1910, 1921, and 1932) and twice in the 21st (2005 and 2016). And it won\u2019t occur again until 2157.",
        "There are MAJOR SPOILERS for Batman v Superman here. The strangest moment of my Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice press screening experience was a taped plea from director Zack Snyder asking fans not to tweet or write blog posts that would spoil the movie. Snyder looks directly into the camera and begs everyone watching to ensure that fans go into the movie .",
        "Over the past few days, the internet has been collectively guffawing at a set of news stories detailing the first penis transplant in the US, which could happen as soon as sometime in the next few weeks. Sure, the notion of a \u201dpenis transplant\u201d might incite a case of the giggles. Penises aren\u2019t medically necessary to keep a patient alive, after all, unlike procedures like heart transplants. But consider: doctors at Johns Hopkins, the first medical team to perform the procedure in the US, intends only to perform the surgeries on veterans who lost their genitalia during combat.",
        "The presidential candidates have vastly different tax plans, but you wouldn\u2019t know it by just listening to them. It\u2019s difficult to translate words like \u201dtax cuts for the middle class\u201d into a real understanding of what a candidate proposes to do. So we asked the Tax Policy Center to help us calculate what would happen to people of various income ranges if a candidate won the election and enacted his or her tax plan. If you want to know what would happen to you specifically, use our calculator here.",
        "Spring in Washington, DC, means cherry blossom season, and the explosion of color around the Tidal Basin near the National Mall. This year, spring is arriving early, not just in Washington, but in a broad swath of the country. A quick Twitter search for photos of cherry blossoms in the DC area show how the trees are already beginning to bud and bloom. The National Park Service recently updated its forecast for peak cherry bloom bloom; it\u2019s now expected March which is about a week and a half earlier than the average date of April 1.",
        "Though Republicans had Saturday off, Democrats in three states \u2014 Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii \u2014 headed to the polls. And Bernie Sanders did fantastically, not only winning all three caucuses but winning them in landslides. The delegates haven\u2019t all been allotted yet, but it appears likely he\u2019ll net around 70 more delegates than Clinton in Saturday\u2019s contests. Yet this would still mean he\u2019s 230 or so pledged delegates behind Clinton \u2014 better off than he was Saturday morning, but worse off than he was on March 10.",
        "It\u2019s been a busy week for foreign news editors: the ISIS attack in Brussels, President Obama\u2019s trips to Cuba and Argentina, North Korea\u2019s ballistic rocket test, Europe\u2019s new refugee policy, presidential candidate speeches to AIPAC, and, now, an airstrike killing ISIS\u2019s . For all these important stories, though, the most consequential development in international affairs this week may have come, believe it or not, in a proposed change to Russian tax policy. Bear with me.",
        "In January 2013, agricultural economist Marc Bellemare was browsing the internet when he noticed a raging debate about (of all things) quinoa. Specifically, whether people in rich countries should feel guilty about eating it. This was the height of the \u201dsuperfood\u201d craze, recall, and Americans and Europeans were scarfing down quinoa \u2014 a alternative to rice with a rich, nutty flavor \u2014 by the bucketful. Global quinoa prices had nearly tripled between 2006 and 2013. Some commenters feared the West\u2019s quinoa binge would spell disaster for the developing world.",
        "On Friday morning, a US airstrike killed Abu Alaa a senior leader in ISIS, whom the US says it considers the organization\u2019s leader. This isn\u2019t the first time has been reported dead \u2014 though the US government has allegedly verified his death. But if (as seems likely) is dead, this will be yet another instance in which ISIS\u2019s No. 2 official has been killed. In August of last year, for example, a US airstrike killed Fadhil Ahmad then identified as the group\u2019s No. 2.",
        "Needless to say, major spoilers for the whole of Batman v Superman follow I can overlook plot holes; every story has them. Heck, even the stories you tell about your own life have plot holes, because nobody has time to recount every single incident that happened, every thought you had. That\u2019s all plot holes are, usually: information we just don\u2019t have that we shouldn\u2019t worry too much about missing as long as everything else is working.",
        "This week, we took a deep dive into the world of diet books authored by doctors. The main premise of the piece: Most of these books purport to hold the one true secret to weight loss \u2014 high protein, low carb, 5:2, \u201dWheat Belly,\u201d you name it. But these books contain a central falsehood: Not only is obesity an extremely complex problem unlikely to have a silver bullet, but what works when it comes to weight loss for any individual is unlikely to work for everybody else.",
        "Donald Trump thinks he knows what\u2019s ailing our political system \u2014 corrupt lobbyists buying off politicians in exchange for government favors. \u201dTheir lobbyists, their special interests and their donors will start calling President Bush, President Clinton,\u201d Trump has said. \u201dAnd they\u2019ll say: \u2018You have to do it. They gave you a million dollars to your campaign.\u201d He usually goes on to state that since he doesn\u2019t need this money, he\u2019ll be freed from this corrupting influence. \u201dI\u2019m my own campaign,\u201d he\u2019s said.",
        "Easter season is upon us, and if you\u2019re like a majority of Americans who celebrate the holiday, you\u2019ll probably purchase some candy for the occasion. And that stash will likely include the hallmark of the season: Peeps. But just where did these squishy harbingers of spring come from? And why are they so popular? Read on to find out. Mmm, marshmallows with eyes In their traditional form, Peeps are shaped like baby chickens and made of a soft marshmallow rolled in colored sugar, with eyes made of edible wax. They are typically sold in packs of five conjoined marshmallows.",
        "Every Sunday, we pick a new episode of the week. It could be good. It could be bad. It will always be interesting. You can read the archives here. The episode of the week for March 20 through 26 is \u201dBali Ha\u2019i,\u201d the sixth episode of the second season of AMC\u2019s Better Call Saul. In some ways, the shows that Better Call Saul is most similar to aren\u2019t its immediate prequel, Breaking Bad, or even other legal dramas.",
        "Meet neurospora crassa. It\u2019s commonly known as red bread mold, and it can perform a magic trick: It can take household chemicals and turn them into components for rechargeable batteries. Let me explain. Geoff Gadd, a professor of biology at the University of Dundee in Scotland, learned that when he puts the mold in a container with urea and manganese, a mineral called manganese carbonate will form around the spindly arms of the fungus.",
        "We did not really require further confirmation that Donald J. Trump doesn\u2019t know much about foreign policy, but we got it this weekend, in the form of a lengthy interview by Maggie Haberman and David Sanger of the New York Times. Despite not knowing much, Trump held forth for about 15, 000 words\u2019 worth of foreign policy talk, and somewhere in there managed to reveal, intentionally or not, some of how he thinks about the world and America\u2019s role in it. Here are a few things that, in my view, this interview showed us about Trump and foreign policy.",
        "In October 2013, one of the most celebrated political dissidents in the world sat down for an interview with BBC presenter Mishal Husain, and it didn\u2019t go great. Aung San Suu Kyi was, at that point, still in the process of transitioning from a Nobel Peace Prize \u2014 winning political prisoner of Myanmar\u2019s military government \u2014 she was kept under house arrest until 2010 \u2014 to the country\u2019s de facto leader. After being freed as part of her country\u2019s opening, her political party won a number of seats in limited 2012 parliamentary elections."
