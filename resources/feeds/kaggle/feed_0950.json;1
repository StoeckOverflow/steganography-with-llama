        "Every day in America, about 31 people are killed in gun homicides. It\u2019s a grisly death toll \u2014 one that no other developed nation has to deal with. The political response to this violence has focused on gun control. But while the research shows gun control is truly effective, federal legislation curtailing access to guns seems unlikely to happen anytime soon. So what can America do to stop gun violence?",
        "This post was updated at 5:30pm after earlier reports that a Capitol police officer had been shot proved to be incorrect. A gunman near the US Capitol was taken to the hospital after being shot by law enforcement on Monday afternoon, according to The New York Times. US Capitol police shot the gunman after he set off the metal detectors at the Capitol Visitor Center, according to CNN. A female bystander was also injured in the altercation.",
        "Over the weekend, science collided hard with celebrity culture when public health advocates successfully intervened in a film festival selection. At the center of the imbroglio was actor Robert De Niro, who last week revealed that he had greenlit the screening of an film at the Tribeca Film Festival, which he . The film, Vaxxed, is directed by the discredited Andrew Wakefield. Wakefield helped sow the seeds of the current movement in 1998 with a bogus study that claimed to have demonstrated that the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine can be linked to autism.",
        "We live in a world that worships the early riser. Think of everything we\u2019re told on the virtues of waking up early. \u201dThe early bird catches the worm.\u201d \u201d early to rise, makes a man. .. \u201d (Ben Franklin\u2019s most famous saying) \u201dNice of you to join us today\u201d (snarky dictum of teachers and bosses everywhere) The message is clear: Starting early is the way to get ahead; lateness is ugly as sin.",
        "This news is sparking outrage: Last week, Japan announced that its whaling boats had returned from Antarctic waters hauling the carcasses of 333 minke whales \u2014 including some 157 pregnant females.* Minke whales aren\u2019t endangered, but their numbers do seem to be declining over time. And what makes this hunt so striking is that the International Court of Justice had ordered Japan to halt a similar Antarctic whaling program back in 2014. Japan claims it is killing minke whales for research purposes. But as Alejandro Davila Fragoso reminds us at Climate Progress, this excuse is nonsense.",
        "\u201dI\u2019ve found divinity in places where people wouldn\u2019t normally see it. I\u2019ve found magic. \u2026 If we see no angels, it\u2019s because we harbor none.

        "Americans want the Republican National Committee to take Second Amendment rights more seriously \u2014 especially in their choice of venue for the 2016 Republican National Convention. More than 41, 000 people have signed a Change. org petition to allow the open carry of firearms at the RNC, which will be held in Cleveland, Ohio, in July. The venue for the RNC event, the Quicken Loans Arena, is a zone, strictly forbidding firearms on the premises.",
        "Over the weekend, Syrian regime forces recaptured the historic Syrian city of Palmyra from ISIS, dealing a major blow to the Islamic State\u2019s territorial organization. The city represented a strategic crossroads, linking Syria\u2019s capital to ISIS strongholds in the country\u2019s east. The group\u2019s retreat east means that regime forces have captured territory, allowing them to move closer to ISIS\u2019s declared capital, Raqqa. But Palmyra, now a desert city of about 65, 000 residents surrounded by palm trees, is also home to some of the world\u2019s most valuable ruins, including towers and temples, as well as countless priceless artifacts.",
        "After widespread outrage that the new Smithsonian Museum of History would include items honoring Bill Cosby, without mentioning the sexual assault allegations against him, the Smithsonian has announced it will reverse course. The museum plans to pay homage to the TV entertainer as one of several featured artists in an exhibit called \u201dTaking the Stage.\u201d But initially, the museum \u2014 which is set to open in September \u2014 intended to omit any mention of the allegations against Cosby made by as many as two dozen women. \u201dVisitors will leave the exhibition knowing more about Mr.",
        "By 1860, slavery had become such a divisive issue between the North and South that the two regions of America literally went to war over the issue. But it wasn\u2019t always this way. As this map (and its interactive version) by historian Lincoln Mullen at George Mason University shows, slavery wasn\u2019t that rare in the North shortly after the US\u2019s birth, although it would be completely abolished over the next few decades: The map is haunting, showing the rapid spread of a, needless to say, deeply abhorrent practice.",
        "The political context of Sunday\u2019s suicide bombing in Lahore; the EU\u2019s migration plan is both incompetent and inhumane; welcome to the age of virtual reality!

        "The past month has seen an astounding rise in public interest around Donald Trump \u2014 at least according to Google search data. Keep in mind that we\u2019re still in the midst of a primary, and we\u2019re still more than 30 weeks away from the general election. But if you compare the volume of people searching for Trump versus other presidential candidates in the Google era, it isn\u2019t even close. The only real comparison is Barack Obama\u2019s historic campaign in 2008.",
        "Some of Bernie Sanders\u2019s most supporters have begun saying that they\u2019ll never vote for Hillary Clinton in a general election \u2014 even if that gives Republicans control of the White House. Don\u2019t count on them following through on the threat. Rallying around the slogan \u201dBernie or Bust,\u201d Sanders loyalists say they\u2019ll sit out a general election or support Green Party candidate Jill Stein if Sanders isn\u2019t the Democratic nominee \u2014 a prospect that\u2019s becoming increasingly likely as the delegate math continues to tip in Clinton\u2019s favor.",
        "Florida Gov. Rick Scott signed a sweeping bill into law on Friday, more or less daring advocates to take the state to court over it, and it looks certain they will. The law defunds Planned Parenthood in a way that may be illegal, and includes other provisions that are being challenged at the Supreme Court because they close abortion clinics for no medical reason. The law, HB 1411, cuts off all state funding for clinics that provide abortions.",
        "Hillary Clinton is the first woman to clinch a major US party\u2019s presidential nomination, and she\u2019s competing against Donald Trump, a man who is accused of being a sexual predator. So it\u2019s no surprise that sexism has been a major theme on the 2016 campaign trail \u2014 from Trump\u2019s blatantly misogynistic remarks, to more subtle sexism from pundits who criticize Hillary\u2019s \u201dshouting\u201d or tell her to \u201dsmile.\u201d But will sexism or stereotypes about Clinton\u2019s gender actually affect who votes for her? That\u2019s a much more complicated question.",
        "The hijacking of EgyptAir Flight 181 on Tuesday morning, when a man claimed to be wearing a suicide vest and demanded to be taken to Cyprus, was surely terrifying for the 64 people on board. But after it came to a conclusion on a Cyprus runway with the arrest of the hijacker, the safe release of the passengers, and no bloodshed, what was most striking was how retro the whole drama seemed. Before this is what hijackings were like: Individuals driven by personal gain or idiosyncratic requests diverted planes to places they weren\u2019t supposed to go.",
        "Update: Donald Trump is now threatening to boycott the CNN town hall, calling the network\u2019s coverage \u201dreally and unfair\u201d in a tweet.

We don\u2019t know how the FBI managed to break the device\u2019s encryption after weeks of insisting that it could do so only with Apple\u2019s help.

        "A case that had the potential to weaken public sector unions across the United States ended with a somewhat unexpected victory for unions on Tuesday, as the Supreme Court divided on the question of requiring nonmembers to pay a fee to the public sector union that negotiates the collective bargain agreement that covers both members and nonmembers. The split vote in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association means a lower court verdict in favor of the union stands.",
        "The first time I asked my about whether an intrauterine device (IUD) was right for me was in 2010. The doctor flatly told me, \u201dNo.\u201d I was 25 and for years had relied on birth control pills for contraception. I had recently started researching other options, and what I\u2019d read online about IUDs seemed promising. The device, once inserted, would prevent pregnancy for at least five years. I didn\u2019t plan to have children anytime soon, so I brought it up with a doctor at a women\u2019s health clinic in downtown Washington, DC.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager will not be prosecuted, after Florida police charged him with battery for grabbing a reporter at a campaign event last month. While Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields still has the option to press defamation charges, a Florida judge has decided Corey Lewandowski\u2019s case will not be pursued further, Politico reported.

        "We\u2019ve only begun to think through how cars could one day reshape our roads, cities, and lives \u2014 for better and for worse. They might, for example, make traffic lights obsolete. Which. .. is actually a bit unsettling. In the video above, researchers at MIT\u2019s Senseable City Lab demonstrate how streets full of autonomous vehicles wouldn\u2019t necessarily need stoplights. If the cars were all communicating with each other, they could simply slow down a bit and \u201dslot\u201d their way through intersections at steady speeds without ever causing a collision.",
        "I spent some time Monday playing around with the excellent tax calculator that Alvin Chang and the Tax Policy Center built. The tool lets you estimate what the tax plans released by Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, and Ted Cruz would mean for your tax bill \u2014 but, more than that, it offers a window into the fundamental ways in which the four candidates are very, very different from one another. Let\u2019s take a family making $100, 000 \u2014 a hefty income, to be sure, but a useful one for illustration.",
        "Last week, the internet exploded with a fairly shocking allegation: President Richard Nixon began America\u2019s war on drugs to criminalize black people and hippies, according to a newly revealed 1994 quote from Nixon domestic policy adviser John Ehrlichman. \u201dThe Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people,\u201d Ehrlichman told journalist Dan Baum in 1994. \u201dYou understand what I\u2019m saying?",
        "If the goal of terrorism is to sow anxiety much more widely than the radius of even the most destructive bomb, a new poll suggests the attacks in Brussels were successful: Americans are really, really worried. A slight majority of Americans say they\u2019re now less willing to travel to Belgium or France than they were before the attacks in those countries. Large majorities say the attacks have made them more concerned about similar threats to the US. And 74 percent said they think there will be a terrorist attack in the US within the next year.",
        "President Barack Obama\u2019s administration on Tuesday advanced what may seem like a small, technical fix but is potentially a big deal to victims of America\u2019s opioid painkiller and heroin epidemic. Specifically, the White House said it will propose a rule to increase the patient limit for qualified doctors who prescribe buprenorphine, which is used to treat opioid abuse, from 100 to 200 patients. In short, this should allow doctors to prescribe the potentially lifesaving medication, also known as Suboxone, to many more patients.",
        "The Supreme Court recently heard a major case on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s birth control benefit, Zubik v. Burwell. You might think of Zubik as the sequel to Hobby Lobby. Both cases deal with contraception, religious freedom, and health insurance. But while Zubik v. Burwell is less than Burwell v. Hobby Lobby was, it might actually be a more important case. \u201dI think a victory for the plaintiffs here would largely confirm many of the worst fears that liberals had after Hobby Lobby,\u201d Ian Millhiser, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, told Vox in March.",
        "Walk into almost any grocery store in the continental United States, and you\u2019ll be able to buy bananas for 79 cents a pound or less. To most of us, this seems utterly normal.

But the fact that bananas have become so commonplace is fairly astounding when you think about it.",
