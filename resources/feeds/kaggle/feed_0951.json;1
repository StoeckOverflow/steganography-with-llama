        "For as often as the United States uses economic sanctions as a foreign policy tool, we sure don\u2019t talk about them much. That\u2019s even more surprising given that the academic research on sanctions is pretty mixed, and often finds that they don\u2019t work. So it was a big surprise to hear Treasury Secretary Jack Lew give a speech, early on Wednesday, about economic sanctions, when they work, and, most surprising of all, when they don\u2019t.",
        "Nuclear weapons are something so scary and so dangerous \u2014 thousands of weapons explicitly designed to be powerful enough to destroy the world many times over, perpetually deployed, and able to be fired with the push of a few buttons, like a gun forever left to the world\u2019s head \u2014 that I\u2019m sometimes amazed at how little we talk about them. There are a few reasons for that. One is that they\u2019re so big and scary it can be difficult for people to wrap their heads around.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign says Bernie Sanders needs to tone it down. But Sanders\u2019s supporters have one question: Tone down for what? A top Clinton aide\u2019s chiding comments about Sanders\u2019s \u201dnegative\u201d tone have prompted Sanders supporters to drudge up all their Clinton attacks on Twitter with the viral hashtag #ToneDownForWhat (a reference to DJ Snake\u2019s song \u201dTurn Down for What\u201d). Are you kidding me @HillaryClinton? If you can\u2019t handle Sanders\u2019 \u201dtone,\u201d good luck dealing with Trump or, I dunno, ISIS.",
        "On Wednesday, President Obama announced plans to reduce the sentences of 61 federal prisoners \u2014 shortening their prison terms, assigned under federal laws and policies, to what they\u2019d serve if they were sentenced today.

        "The scientists who study the Great Barrier Reef are shocked and horrified by what they\u2019re seeing right now. Record hot temperatures in the Pacific Ocean \u2014 driven by global warming and a powerful El Ni\u00f1o \u2014 have fueled the worst coral bleaching event ever seen along the northern third of Australia\u2019s famed reef.

        "Wind and sunlight are often concentrated in sparsely populated, remote areas. Getting wind and solar power to the population centers where it\u2019s needed involves building power lines. Lots of them. Earlier this week I wrote about a new power line in the US and the long, slow path it took to win approval. It was proposed in 2009; construction is expected to begin next year and finish in 2020. Like everything involving electricity in the US, it had to navigate a skein of overlapping jurisdictions, multiple state and local authorities, and federal rules.",
        "North Carolina\u2019s controversial new law bans nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ people and stops transgender people in schools and government buildings from using the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. But it\u2019s having another effect: It\u2019s potentially damaging the state\u2019s economy. Several celebrities and organizations across the US have condemned the law since it passed last week. Some have said they will boycott or otherwise reduce their business in the state. Related How most states allow discrimination against LGBTQ people This is potentially a big deal.",
        "Charlie Stross wrote a blog post arguing that Apple\u2019s interest in strong encryption is linked to its interest in secure payments, which in turn is linked to its plan to leverage the company\u2019s enormous stockpile of cash into becoming a bank and disrupting the entire consumer banking industry. It\u2019s a fun idea to think about. And when you start thinking about it, you quickly realize that not only do Apple\u2019s consumer relationships suggest a possible banking opportunity but so do Amazon\u2019s and Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s.",

        "The story of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski\u2019s alleged physical assault of reporter Michelle Fields at a campaign event has gotten stranger and more disturbing by the day. Despite video and eyewitness testimony to the contrary, Lewandowski, other Trump aides, and Trump himself have all furiously denied that anything happened and have attacked Fields\u2019s character. Meanwhile, Lewandowski was charged with battery Tuesday and has turned himself in to the authorities. And Trump is still standing by his campaign manager. Aggressively.",

It was one thing when he was encouraging his guests to sing impromptu little numbers at his desk, like the time he convinced fellow Stephen Sondheim fan Anna Kendrick to join him in a classic Broadway duet from Annie Get Your Gun (the singing starts at 7:28) with harmonies so lovely Kendrick had to fan herself .",

        "It\u2019s obvious if you walk around many neighborhoods in New York, San Francisco, Washington, DC, and other large cities that urban living is enjoying a revival in the United States of America. But Census Bureau statistics also clearly show that the overall population of the United States is more suburban than ever. How can both be true?",
        "Donald Trump blew up the news cycle on Wednesday by telling Chris Matthews at a town hall that \u201dthere has to be some form of punishment\u201d for women who have abortions if the procedure is outlawed. Trump later reversed course and said that if abortion were illegal, criminal penalties would fall on doctors, not women. That\u2019s the mainstream position, but Trump seemingly wasn\u2019t aware of this. advocates, meanwhile, said that this mainstream position is disingenuous, and that Trump\u2019s comments reveal the inevitable consequences of outlawing abortion. Here\u2019s what Twitter had to say about the whole thing.",
        "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) took an action Wednesday that will significantly expand women\u2019s access to medication abortion \u2014 and totally derail an lawmaking strategy in the process. The FDA officially changed its approved drug regimen for mifepristone (brand name Mifeprex) which is used together with misoprostol to end an early pregnancy. This particular \u201dlabel change\u201d is one that reproductive rights advocates have been seeking for more than a decade. The label for mifepristone hasn\u2019t been updated since 2000, and doctors have learned a lot about the drug since then.",
        "Another police shooting of an unarmed black man \u2014 this time in Minnesota \u2014 will result in no criminal charges. Last November, an altercation between two white police officers and Jamar Clark, a black man, ended up with Clark shot and dead. Although some video footage of the shooting is available, what exactly led up to the shooting \u2014 and, importantly, what Clark and the officers did and said \u2014 remains unclear.

        "Both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama pushed free trade deals as president, but both faced massive resistance from Democrats in Congress. And in the 2016 campaign, both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders came out against Obama\u2019s Partnership deal \u2014 for Clinton, a very rare break with the White House. But a new Pew survey confirms that trade deals are broadly popular in the United States, especially with Democrats, and including with supporters of both Sanders and Clinton.",

        "Disabled Americans often endure voting horror stories like voting booths that can\u2019t accommodate wheelchairs, or machines that don\u2019t work for visually impaired people. But some people with disabilities are simply blocked from polls in the first place, because of a growing number of voter identification laws. These laws, warns Doug Kruse of Syracuse University, are a looming issue for disabled voters, for a simple reason: They\u2019re generally less likely to have identification, an issue noted by the American Civil Liberties Union and other civil rights groups along with disability activists.",
        "The affair allegations swirling around Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley is a multilayered scandal, involving sex, money, and corruption. It resembles more of an unfolding soap opera than how politics should really work. Unfortunately, that\u2019s the reality for Alabama, a state that prides itself for its high morals and at the same time has had to confront a burgeoning number of corrupt elected officials.

Bernie Sanders has an even more ambitious plan for a $1 trillion boost over five years, paid for by a bigger hike in corporate taxes. This is typical of how the Democratic Party works.

        "Look no further than the field of food science to see what a distorting force industry funding of scientific research can be.
