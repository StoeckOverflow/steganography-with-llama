        "It\u2019s April Fools\u2019 Day, so you\u2019re probably devoting more brainpower than you\u2019d care to admit to potential hoaxes that your friends and \u2014 heck, even your favorite news organizations \u2014 might pull on you. But why April 1, of all days? How did we come to associate the first day of the fourth month of the year with an opportunity to take advantage of the more gullible among us? The short answer is nobody really knows. The longer answer: The first clear and widespread mentions of April Fools\u2019 Day occurred in the 18th century.",
        "The American economy added 213, 000 jobs in March, continuing the slow but steady pace of the Obama economic recovery: For the past several years, economists \u2014 and the general public \u2014 have been waiting for the kind of robust economic growth we saw in the 1990s. This kind of growth draws a lot of previously discouraged workers back into the labor force and pushes up wages. But there\u2019s no sign that that\u2019s happening. Wages grew by 2.",
        "This Sunday, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) will hold its biggest show of the year, WrestleMania. The 2016 edition of WrestleMania is the 32nd such event put on by WWE, the most recognizable pro wrestling organization \u2014 or, to use WWE parlance, \u201dsports entertainment company\u201d \u2014 in the world, and is expected to break its own indoor attendance record with 100, 000 fans packed into Dallas\u2019s AT&T Stadium.

TOP NEWS Tesla, turbocharged Tesla. Electric car manufacturer Tesla unveiled its Model 3 today \u2014 its first car priced for the mass market. Within 24 hours, it\u2019s received 180, 000 preorders.

        "It would be really weird to walk into a bank and have the teller take down your information on pen and paper. But it happens all the time in medicine! We accept the fact that doctors scrawl our information onto pieces of paper because of an incredible struggle to get medicine to go digital. On this episode of The Weeds, we look at what the big obstacles are \u2014 and how health care would change if paper medical records became a thing of the past.",
        "Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant on Tuesday signed into a law a religious freedom measure that is very clearly written to allow some businesses to deny services to LGBTQ people. But there\u2019s a twist: The state is already so lacking in LGBTQ legal protections that this new law isn\u2019t needed to allow discrimination. Here are some of the major provisions regarding discrimination in the legislation: It allows religious organizations and religious nonprofits to deny people services they religiously object to. This could allow a religious adoption agency to, for instance, deny services to a couple without risking government interference.",
        "Nude pumps, nude tights, and nude are all intended to give the allure of bare skin. But in fashion as we know it, nude has come to mean more the color beige than the concept of nakedness. Google \u201dnude tights,\u201d and you\u2019ll likely get a result like this: For years iconic French luxury footwear designer Christian Louboutin has been trying to flip this script, recognizing that selling nude shoes only in beige or a light tan excludes many of his customers. In 2013 he released a collection of five shades of nude shoes.",
        "Soft drink makers like and Pepsi are taking a hit as more Americans turn away from sodas. According to new data compiled by per capita consumption of soft drinks in 2015 hit its lowest level since 1985. On the one hand, this suggests the public health campaigning around sugary drinks is working, leading Americans to drink less soda. These drinks are the top source of added sugar in the US diet, and have been a leading contributor to the obesity crisis and cause of tooth decay.",
        "New York state just passed the nation\u2019s most comprehensive paid family leave policy yet, guaranteeing that all New Yorkers \u2014 men and women, employees of small and large firms, and or employees \u2014 can take three months of partially paid time off to take care of a new child or a sick family member without losing their jobs. New York will join California, New Jersey, and Rhode Island in guaranteeing paid family leave. But New York\u2019s benefits will be much more generous \u2014 offering 12 weeks while California and New Jersey offer six, and Rhode Island just four.",
        "As states like California and cities like Seattle boost their minimum wages up to $15 an hour, critics warn that job losses will be inevitable. In particular, one major line of criticism from outlets like the Wall Street Journal editorial page and Forbes\u2019s Tim Worstall is that big increases in pay floors only lead to job loss via automation. Both critics point to initiatives at McDonald\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s to automate more of the service process, and warn that robots, rather than workers, will be the real winners if liberals succeed in boosting minimum pay. This is doubly wrong.",
        "Everything is bigger in Texas \u2014 even the sporting events. It\u2019s no coincidence that this year\u2019s Final Four tournament is held in Houston; the state has, since the passage of a 2003 statute, aggressively courted major events using public funds. It even set up a trust fund that cities can tap into when they want to host a large event. Houston has put $8. 4 million from it toward this weekend\u2019s NCAA men\u2019s basketball national semifinals and championship. What Texas does is an anomaly, as many cities opt for tax hikes to raise their own funds for large events.",
        "Happy pi day! The date is, of course, a poor approximation for \u03c0, which has infinite digits (3. 1415926. ..). But that raises a few questions: How many digits have we actually found? And how many do we need? Back in 2010, Shigeru Kondo and Alexander Yee caused a stir when they announced they\u2019d calculated pi to 5 trillion digits with homemade computers. (The whole project nearly collapsed when Kondo\u2019s daughter turned on a hair dryer and tripped a circuit breaker.) Since then, other researchers have used Yee\u2019s methods to calculate 22 trillion digits and counting.",
        "It is Saturday, and it is officially spring. You made it! To celebrate, here is the best the web has to offer for news from the week of March 28, 2016. The 2015 VIDA Count is in with its annual assessment of women\u2019s representation in literary publications, and we discussed it here at Vox. You do not need to read that Telegraph article about how the internet has rendered the library obsolete; you already know that claim to be nonsense.",
        "On Thursday, Elon Musk unveiled a prototype of Tesla\u2019s new Model 3, the vehicle that, he hopes, will finally help electric cars go mainstream when it hits the market in December 2017. The news has induced the sort of feeding frenzy usually associated with shark chum and Apple products. More than 180, 000 people have already plunked down a (refundable) $1, 000 deposit to reserve their Model 3 a year in advance.",
        "Here\u2019s a telling fact about modern American politics: Republicans only trust Fox News. Democrats trust every network but Fox News. The numbers come from a new study from political scientists Matt Grossmann and Dave Hopkins collating five years of Public Policy Polling data on which major news networks people do and do not trust. PPP\u2019s data shows that Republicans are just as distrustful of mainstream outlets as of MSNBC, and Democrats are about as trusting: PPP isn\u2019t alone in this finding. Grossmann and Hopkins survey a bevy of other sources finding similar patterns.",
        "Here\u2019s a remarkable fact: Not a single person has died using bike share in the United States. Bike sharing has seen explosive growth since 2007, with systems in at least 94 cities and more than 35 million trips taken. There have been some serious injuries, yes. But \u2014 knock on wood \u2014 we\u2019ve seen zero US deaths from bike sharing so far1. Contrast this with the overall estimated cycling fatality rate of 21 deaths per 100 million trips. I should also mention that there has been one documented death in Mexico and two in Canada.",
        "The 20 million people that live in Mexico City and its surrounding suburbs are plagued daily by a hazy layer of smog. But after years of struggling to maintain healthy air quality levels, the Mexican capital says it has a temporary fix: Keep more cars off the streets. Starting Tuesday, Mexico City\u2019s metropolitan authorities will implement a comprehensive \u201dno circulation\u201d policy to keep all privately owned cars off the road one day per week, and one additional Saturday per month, the Associated Press reported.",
        "Originally published on Ensia. Ten years ago, as part of a sustainability initiative, Walmart decided to take a look at its greenhouse gas emissions. The retail giant not only tallied up the carbon footprint of its trucking fleet and supersize stores, it also set out to quantify the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the countless products offered on its shelves.",
        "The Ranch, Netflix\u2019s new sitcom, is caught between what it wants to be and what it actually is. What it wants to be is a surprisingly effective collection of plays that are sprinkled with laughs but mostly dramatic in nature. What it is is an occasionally effective (but always daring) sitcom, filmed before a live studio audience and packed with smutty jokes. Rating 3. 5 It\u2019s kind of like if Two and a Half Men spent roughly half of every episode taking its characters\u2019 disappointments seriously.",
        "Time to give thanks to the streaming gods: The complete series of The OC \u2014 a. k. a. one of the greatest gifts the early aughts ever gave us \u2014 is now available on Hulu. Thanks to a new deal between the streaming platform and Warner Bros. all four seasons of The OC will be available for your viewing pleasure.",
        "It\u2019s not typical for the Supreme Court circa 2016 to issue unanimous opinions on politically charged cases \u2014 especially when those cases are about voting rights. But on Monday, in the case Evenwel v. Abbott, the court ruled against a proposal to change who got counted in drawing up congressional districts \u2014 which would have given more political power to largely white areas while reducing the power of heavily Hispanic and ones.",
        "The best way to understand Milo Yiannopoulos, internet troll extraordinaire, is to ask him about feminism. \u201d social justice warriors always banging on about \u2019affirmative consent\u2019 are secretly the first to strap on a gimp mask and demand to get fucked eleven ways,\u201d Yiannopoulos wrote to me in an email. \u201dWhich, don\u2019t get me wrong, sounds great!\u201d This type of stuff \u2014 crass tirades that straddle the border between the genuinely angry and intentionally provocative \u2014 are what make Milo Milo.",
        "The FBI is refusing to tell Apple or the public how it hacked the iPhone of San Bernardino terrorism suspect Syed Farook. But in a letter to local law enforcement obtained by BuzzFeed, the federal agency signaled that it wasn\u2019t going to stop with unlocking a single iPhone. \u201dWe will continue to do everything we can to help you consistent with our legal and policy constraints,\u201d wrote Kerry Sleeper, an FBI official responsible for managing the FBI\u2019s relationships with other law enforcement agencies.",
        "The LGBTQ rights movement has seen major gains over the past several years, but the future of equality in America seems stuck at a crossroads. On one hand, the Supreme Court upheld couples\u2019 right to marry nationwide. Transgender people and their issues are finally getting national attention with Caitlyn Jenner coming out and growing media attention from shows like Transparent and Orange Is the New Black. And the Utah passed a nondiscrimination law protecting LGBTQ people in the workplace and housing.",
        "The Department of Housing and Urban Development announced a new plan to help people who\u2019ve been convicted of a crime find a place to live, NPR reports. The agency is beginning to warn landlords that it might be illegal under the Fair Housing Act to simply ban anyone with a criminal record. It\u2019s not that being convicted of a crime is a protected category under the Fair Housing Act. The law prevents housing discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.",
        "Would you trust a stranger with a packet filled with notes detailing your sexual secrets? In 2010, psychologist Anthony Lane and his colleagues at Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium assumed most people would not. But they had a hunch about how to manipulate levels of trust with oxytocin, a neurochemical best known for its ability to induce labor. Just one whiff of it, they thought, might make people less anxious about a stranger \u2014 in this case, the researcher running the experiment.",
        "Richard Branson, Virgin\u2019s billionaire founder, is sad that Virgin America airlines is being sold to Alaska Airlines for $2. 6 billion: \u201dI would be lying if I didn\u2019t admit sadness that our wonderful airline is merging with another,\u201d he wrote on his blog. \u201dThere was sadly nothing I could do to stop it.\u201d And Branson isn\u2019t the only one. whaaaaaaaplease dont crapify virgin i love it https: . \u2014 \u0ca0_\u0ca0 (@MikeIsaac) April 2, 2016 Virgin America is a tiny minnow in the US airline market, but it\u2019s a beloved one.",
        "What do members of Congress spend most of their day doing? It\u2019s not necessarily making laws, research, committee work, or talking to everyday constituents. Instead, as much as of their time \u2014 and typically about 25 to 50 percent \u2014 goes to congressional fundraising. In a long, revealing segment on Sunday\u2019s Last Week Tonight, John Oliver detailed the arduous process of fundraising in Congress, explaining how we got to a point where candidates for the House and Senate raised $1. 7 billion in the 2014 election cycle. Why is this such a problem? Sen.",
        "Jeffrey Lord was sitting at his home in rural Pennsylvania in July 2015 when the phone rang. It was CNN. Donald Trump had just declared his presidential campaign, and Trump recommended Lord to the network as someone who could defend him. Maybe Lord, CNN asked, could explain why someone would vote for Trump? Lord called a friend from his Pennsylvania church, who scrambled over to take care of Lord\u2019s mother, who is 96 and struggling with dementia, so Lord could get to the local television studio. CNN soon hired Lord to appear regularly as an analyst.",
