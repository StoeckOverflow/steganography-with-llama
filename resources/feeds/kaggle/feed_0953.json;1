        "Are you ready to get back Inside Amy Schumer? The fourth season of Amy Schumer\u2019s sketch comedy series debuts on Comedy Central on April 21, and to celebrate, the comedian has released a brand new sketch starring herself and Miranda, the creator and star of Broadway\u2019s Hamilton. Schumer plays an aspiring musical producer, and after sliding into Miranda\u2019s Twitter DMs she convinces him to meet her in person, at which point she proceeds to \u201dpitch\u201d her own \u201d .\u201d \u201dA musical about another historical, famous revolutionary character named . ..

        "Is there anything in this world that can\u2019t be improved by Dire Straits\u2019 \u201dWalk of Life,\u201d the band\u2019s seminal ode to just being a person, man? This is the theory behind Peter Salomone\u2019s \u201dWalk of Life Project,\u201d which is about as straightforward as it sounds. Salomone has made a habit of editing \u201dWalk of Life\u201d into the endings of famous movies (and even a couple of television shows) the better to play them out to a jauntier tune.",
        "Nest is a Silicon Valley company that makes a widely praised home thermostat \u2014 I wrote about the device last year. Google acquired the company in 2014. And not long after that, Nest acquired a company called Revolv that sold a hub allowing customers to electronically control the lights in their homes. Nest wasn\u2019t really interested in Revolv\u2019s hub, though. Instead, it wanted to get its hands on Revolv\u2019s talented engineers and reassign them work on other Nest projects. Revolv stopped selling its hub at the time of the acquisition in October 2014.",
        "Icelandic Prime Minister Sigmundur Dav\u00ed\u00f0 Gunnlaugsson resigned on Tuesday, after documents leaked from a law firm revealed that his wife possesses a secret offshore account worth millions of dollars. The money is housed in a shell corporation called Wintris, which had bought bonds in Icelandic banks. So when Iceland\u2019s financial sector collapsed in 2008, Wintris became a creditor to those banks. In 2013, Gunnlaugsson became the prime minister, having run partly on a promise to get tougher with Iceland\u2019s remaining foreign creditors.",
        "Bernie Sanders\u2019s fans could have something to celebrate in Wisconsin on Tuesday night, with the Vermont senator poised to potentially win big in the state. But if their goal is for Sanders to actually win the nomination \u2014 as opposed to stringing up symbolic victories over Hillary Clinton \u2014 they should wait to see if he can dramatically outperform expectations and take the state by double digits. Most polls have found Sanders up by anywhere from 2 to 8 points in the state.",
        "The Republican Party is so divided right now, it makes One Direction seem like one cohesive unit. Whether the brokered convention scenario pans out or not, Donald Trump\u2019s effect on the GOP will undoubtedly be profound and potentially lasting. What we\u2019re witnessing is a cleavage moment within the party, and many are calling these disagreements an identity crisis. To find out just how splintered the GOP is, Vox went to this year\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) the right\u2019s heralded annual gathering. What we found was a surprising amount of unity \u2014 in these conservatives\u2019 unflinching contempt for Trump.",
        "On March 23, a few hundred activists dialed into a conference call dubbed \u201dWhite Rage and the State of Our Movements.\u201d They didn\u2019t have to say the words \u201dDonald Trump\u201d in their call to action. Participants knew what sort of \u201dwhite rage\u201d they meant. The call was organized by a set of distant, if not exactly unusual, allies: the Black Lives Matter organization, the campaign that\u2019s operated under the hashtag #Not1More, and the Grassroots Global Justice Alliance (which works on global issues including climate change).",
        "I have always been skeptical about carbon capture and sequestration at power plants. It\u2019s not so much the technological barriers \u2014 they are serious, though not insurmountable \u2014 but the cost. Fossil fuel power plants have steadily gotten more efficient, but the problem is, no matter how efficient your plant is, capturing the carbon dioxide emissions involves bolting on a second facility to process and separate the waste gases. That second facility requires power (it\u2019s a \u201dparasitic load,\u201d cutting into efficiency) and it adds to capital costs.",
        "As Wisconsin voters head to the polls today, the political world\u2019s conventional wisdom is once again tipping against Donald Trump. Many savvy observers have moved from feeling that Trump is likely to be the Republican nominee to once again harboring grave doubts about whether he can actually pull it off. We\u2019re even suddenly seeing trial balloons floated for Paul Ryan as the nominee. But are these political elites overreacting to recent news items and falling into old patterns of underestimating both Trump\u2019s resilience and the importance of finishing with a delegate plurality?",
        "Welcome to Dear Julia, a column where readers submit everyday health questions. Which painkillers work best? Will intermittent fasting help you lose weight? Julia Belluz sifts through the research and consults experts in the field to figure out how science can help us live happier and healthier lives. Dear Julia: Can I trust WebMD?

        "Libya and the 2011 NATO intervention there have become synonymous with failure, disaster, and the Middle East being a \u201dshit show\u201d (to use President Obama\u2019s colorful descriptor). It has perhaps never been more important to question this prevailing wisdom, because how we interpret Libya affects how we interpret Syria and, importantly, how we assess Obama\u2019s foreign policy legacy. Of course, Libya, as anyone can see, is a mess, and Americans are reasonably asking if the intervention was a mistake. But just because it\u2019s reasonable doesn\u2019t make it right.",
        "After an group released doctored videos attacking Planned Parenthood last summer, the FBI noticed a significant uptick in violence and threats against abortion providers \u2014 including a deadly shooting at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood. And now, startling new data from the National Abortion Federation (NAF) shows just how massive that uptick was. NAF, the professional association of abortion providers in America, collects data from its members on violent incidents and threats. Of course, the Colorado shooting caused a spike in the number of murders and attempted murders at abortion clinics in 2015.",
        "I\u2019ve written before about the global coal renaissance \u2014 the single biggest energy and climate story of the past 15 years. Since 2000, countries like China, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam have been building power plants at a torrid pace: The coal boom has had undeniable benefits, helping poor countries climb out of poverty. But it also has serious downsides: Carbon dioxide emissions accelerated in the 2000s, and if coal continues to be the world\u2019s leading source of electricity, we\u2019ll cook the planet.",
        "For 60 years, Americans thought they\u2019d vanquished bedbugs forever. They were wrong. Horribly, horribly wrong. Bedbugs have been a staple of American life since the Mayflower. In 1926, infestations in hotels and apartments had become so common that experts couldn\u2019t recall a time when they weren\u2019t a problem. People hated being bitten in the night by these pesky bloodsuckers hiding in mattresses, but the bugs seemed impossible to wipe out. Then everything changed in 1939, when a Swiss chemist named Paul Hermann Muller discovered the pesticide DDT, which proved stunningly effective at killing insects.",
        "Tuesday\u2019s presidential primary elections in Wisconsin weren\u2019t particularly close. Though there are still some votes left to be counted, Bernie Sanders won the Democratic race easily with about 56 percent of the vote. And Ted Cruz was triumphant in the Republican contest, pulling about half of the statewide vote and leading Donald Trump by double digits. But the winners aren\u2019t all that matter in these races. For Democrats, every race is proportional, so the margin by which Sanders beats Clinton will determine how much ground she gains on her in the delegate count.",
        "and actress and weed lover Whoopi Goldberg is throwing her name behind a new line of medical edibles and bath products aimed at women. Hailed by MSNBC as a \u201dculmination of a movement toward changing the narrative on legal weed,\u201d the Whoopi & Maya products \u2014 a bath soak, sipping chocolate, tincture, and rub \u2014 are supposed to soothe menstrual cramps and discomfort.

        "The NFL has found a surprising venue for its Thursday night football games: Twitter. This fall Thursday Night Football will be streamed live @twitter so fans will see more of this. https: . \u2014 Roger Goodell (@nflcommish) April 5, 2016 The NFL was particularly interested in getting a tech company for the streaming rights to Thursday Night Football, sending requests for proposals to Google, Yahoo, Apple, and Amazon, according to a December report from Sports Business News. The rights only apply to computers, not to mobile devices. Streaming football is a big deal.",
        "Wisconsin voters have spoken loud and clear: They think Donald Trump is a loser. Ted Cruz won a solid victory in the Badger State\u2019s Republican primary Tuesday, according to early calls by multiple networks. Trump was projected to finish in second, and John Kasich was far back in third place. Most of the state\u2019s 42 delegates are likely to go to Cruz. Eighteen will be allotted to him due to his statewide win, and three more will go to the winner in each of the state\u2019s eight congressional districts.",
        "Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign is based on a simple theory: There is a reserve army of liberal voters who\u2019ve sat out past elections but who stand ready to support a more stridently leftist Democratic nominee. By getting these historic nonvoters to turn out, Sanders claims, he could win the general election, maybe take back the House and Senate, and have an organized public ready to pressure Congress to pass a democratic socialist agenda.",
        "Disease outbreaks are terrible for people but great for our scientific understanding of viruses. That\u2019s especially true for the Zika virus, which seemingly burst out of nowhere to become a top health research priority in the past year. Prior to the massive, ongoing outbreak in the Americas, there had only been about 25 published research papers on the disease since 1952. Researchers long thought Zika was a fairly benign virus, spread mainly by mosquitoes and endemic to Africa. It wasn\u2019t on the radar as any sort of threat.",
        "Oysters seem like very simple animals: just two rocky shells surrounding globs of gray flesh. But this modest appearance belies the oyster\u2019s extraordinary capabilities, which range from filtering water to reengineering coastlines to restoring destroyed habitats for North American marine life. Oysters helped form the planet as we know it today. \u201dBasically, they make rock,\u201d as their shells become the basis for limestone, Rowan Jacobsen, the author of A Geography of Oysters, writes me in an email.",
        "You know setting aside money for retirement is smart, but you don\u2019t know anything about how it works. You need advice. Where do you turn? Maybe you have a financially savvy friend or family member. But a lot of people turn to professional advisers. Until now there have been two different kinds of investment advisers: those who are required to work in your best interests, and those who \u2014 amazingly \u2014 are not. But a new rule from the Department of Labor, which becomes final today, aims to change that.",
        "Every now and then in American politics, political parties enter their presidential nominating conventions deeply, deeply divided. And when they are deeply divided, they lose. Conventions, rather than being coronations, turn into battles between rival factions, each with a legitimate hope that it will somehow come away from the convention with its candidate as the nominee. But in the end, the party can only choose one nominee, and thus only one faction can win. That means the other faction goes home dejected and angry. Some of them will vote for another candidate. Some won\u2019t vote at all.",
        "In January, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell called for an immediate moratorium on new federal leases for private developers to exploit coal so that the program could undergo its first review in 30 years. Thirty years ago, the goal of the coal leasing program was explicitly to encourage coal extraction. And as long as it has been leasing coal, the federal government has been doing it on the cheap, giving US coal companies a leg up. The top US coal companies have come to depend on federal coal. These days, things are different. The US is moving away from coal.",
        "Beyonc\u00e9 is one of the most influential entertainers in a generation, but hearing her direct thoughts outside of her music is an increasingly rare event. As she gets more and more powerful, the performer has shied further and further away from publicity and the press, giving precious few interviews. Recently she even denied an interview to Vogue, despite being on the cover. But in an interview for Elle\u2019s May 2016 issue, Beyonc\u00e9 granted some rare perspective on some contentious topics.",
        "The past few decades haven\u2019t been kind to Australia\u2019s majestic Great Barrier Reef. Since 1985, half the reef\u2019s coral has been ravaged by tropical storms, invasive starfish, disease, and coral bleaching driven by rising ocean temperatures. This past March, due to El Ni\u00f1o and global warming, an unprecedented bleaching event in the northern third of the reef turned 95 percent of corals a ghastly bone white. Usually when disaster befalls coral reefs, they take about 10 or 20 years to bounce back.",
        "The Daily Show\u2019s Trevor Noah on Tuesday took a look at Donald Trump\u2019s \u201dcampaign to insult as many demographic groups as possible.\u201d Specifically, he focused on Trump\u2019s treatment of women. \u201dTrump\u2019s misogyny easily predates the election,\u201d Noah said. \u201dIn fact, it\u2019s pretty much his only consistent belief.\u201d There have been many examinations of Trump\u2019s past to prove this point, including an ad in which women simply repeated some of the Republican frontrunner\u2019s previous sexist remarks. But to prove his point, Noah turned to a clip from a 1994 episode of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.",
        "Kerry Washington is on the cover of the April 4 edition of Adweek, but she doesn\u2019t quite look like herself \u2014 a fact that hasn\u2019t escaped the Scandal and Confirmation actress. So. ..You know me. I\u2019m not one to be quiet about a magazine cover. I always celebrate it when a respected publication invites me to grace their pages. It\u2019s an honor. And a privilege. And ADWEEK is no exception. I love ADWEEK. It\u2019s a publication I appreciate. And learn from. I\u2019ve long followed them on Twitter.",
        "As the Olympics are about to get underway with the opening ceremony on Friday night, it\u2019s worth remembering how much they\u2019ve changed. The first modern Olympic Games \u2014 which started 120 years ago \u2014 included something more commonly associated with entitled children than ancient Greeks: a participation trophy. All 250 participants went home with a bronze medal. That\u2019s not the only way the first modern Olympics, which revived a ancient Greek tradition, differed from today\u2019s glitzy, highly produced, occasionally spectacle.",
        "The People v. O. J. Simpson isn\u2019t a courtroom drama. It\u2019s not a campy retelling of the \u201dtrial of the century.\u201d It\u2019s not even a true crime thriller. Okay, yes, it is occasionally all of those things, but as \u201dThe Verdict,\u201d the final episode of the miniseries, winds down, it reveals that The People v. O. J. Simpson is also something else: a ghost story. The ghost that haunts the series, however, isn\u2019t any conventional spirit. It is, instead, the trial itself, the inescapable force that thrust a spotlight on everybody associated with it."
