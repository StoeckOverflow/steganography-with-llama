        "Is the media biased against Bernie Sanders? His supporters certainly think so. Hundreds of them recently picketed CNN, and I\u2019m regularly deluged by emails from Bernie backers who feel the press \u2014 including Vox \u2014 is biased against their candidate. I think there are ways in which the media tilts against Sanders, and that some of the reasons for that bias exist primarily as subtext, rather than text, which makes coverage of the candidate confusing for anyone reading it. That said, there are also important ways in which the media tilts toward Sanders and against Hillary Clinton.",
        "A few years ago, Nest was widely viewed as one of Silicon Valley\u2019s brightest stars. Founded by Tony Fadell, a key figure in Apple\u2019s iPod team, Nest aimed to produce a line of connected home appliances. Given Fadell\u2019s Apple background and Nest\u2019s focus on hardware, many people wondered if Nest would become the new Apple. But last Friday, Fadell announced he was stepping down as Nest\u2019s CEO after months of criticism for an erratic management style and slow growth at the company. The company\u2019s first product, the Nest Learning Thermostat, got rave reviews when it was introduced in 2011.",
        "It was the most optimistic, conclusion social science had produced in years. In 2014, political scientists, writing in the journal Science, reported that humans \u2014 stubborn and cliquish as we are \u2014 are capable of a profound change of mind. The researchers had demonstrated that a conversation with a gay canvasser could make a lasting impression on a voter\u2019s willingness to support marriage legislation. That may sound small, but it was amazing: The vast majority of social science research finds that persuading people to change their attitude is hard, if not impossible.",
        "While attention has focused on the 2016 presidential campaign and the drama of Senate Republicans\u2019 blockade of Merrick Garland, the Obama administration has been quietly undertaking a series of tough, obscure, progressive economic policy measures that seriously threaten the bottom lines of America\u2019s once untouchable banks. Today comes a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule restoring customers\u2019 right to sue banks for misconduct, following announcements in April of new rules on tax inversions and financial advising, along with hints of a substantial crackdown on shell companies.",
        "Another day, another absolutely dismal poll for Donald Trump\u2019s general election chances. A new national Associated poll finds that 63 percent of registered voters say they \u201ddefinitely would not\u201d vote for Trump this fall. That\u2019s remarkable. And that might not even be Trump\u2019s floor. Another 19 percent of registered voters only said they\u2019d \u201dconsider\u201d voting for Trump. A mere 16 percent said they \u201ddefinitely would\u201d do so. Some amazing new numbers from our @AP poll. pic. twitter.",
        "Bernie Sanders says Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t qualified to be president. He says he only said this because Hillary Clinton said he\u2019s not qualified to be president, which Clinton\u2019s campaign says she didn\u2019t say. Asked for evidence of Clinton\u2019s attack, Sanders\u2019s campaign pointed to this Washington Post story, which is headlined, \u201dClinton questions whether Sanders is qualified to be president,\u201d but does not actually include any comments from Clinton questioning Sanders\u2019s qualifications to be president. Thus goes presidential politics in the most powerful country the world has ever known in the year of our lord 2016.",
        "A bill that would have banned transgender students in Tennessee from using the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity will be held until next year, Rep. Susan Lynn, its sponsor, announced Monday. The bill would ban transgender students, who identify with a gender different than the one assigned to them at birth, from using bathrooms and locker rooms in public schools and colleges that correspond with their gender identity. The Tennessee House Education Administration and Planning Committee passed the bill on April 6.",
        "This morning, Star Wars fans who tuned in to ABC\u2019s Good Morning America got their first glimpse of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. The newest Star Wars movie, set to open December 16, will hopefully help fill in the crucial gap years between Star Wars: Episode III \u2014 Revenge of the Sith and Star Wars: Episode IV \u2014 A New Hope. Luckily for the rest of us, Lucasfilm released the trailer online at the same time.",
        "Tabletop gaming is the gaming community\u2019s older but not necessarily wiser sibling. From Dungeons & Dragons to Munchkin, Magic: The Gathering, Settlers of Catan, and countless other \u201dtitles,\u201d board games, games, and card games have spawned an entire adjacent subculture of geekdom ranging from casual local game nights to intense convention tournaments. The tabletop gaming community doesn\u2019t necessarily overlap with the massive, amorphous communities that make up online video game culture.",
        "In a ruling in which you could almost feel judges rolling their eyes, the First Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday confirmed that marriage is legal in Puerto Rico after the US Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 ruling legalizing marriage equality nationwide. Previously, US District Court Judge Juan said the Supreme Court ruling did not apply to Puerto Rico because it is a territory, not a state.",
        "The biggest scandal in the Panama Papers leak, which revealed that political leaders around the world were hiding money in offshore accounts, isn\u2019t about corruption or organized crime. The 11. 5 million files stolen from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca revealed just how unequal the world is. The economist Gabriel Zucman estimated in his 2015 book, The Hidden Wealth of Nations, that worldwide more than $7. 5 trillion is squirreled away in offshore tax havens \u2014 8 percent of the world\u2019s financial wealth.",
        "There\u2019s one thing, and maybe one thing only, that American leaders agree on when it comes to the Middle East: The Kurds are our best friends against ISIS. There\u2019s a reason for that: Kurdish forces are dedicated, dependable, and successful. In Iraq, Kurdish forces have cut ISIS supply lines in the country\u2019s north, laying the groundwork for an Iraqi government assault on Mosul. In Syria, Kurdish forces have moved to within 30 miles of ISIS\u2019s de facto capital, Raqqa. But as ISIS recedes, America\u2019s alliance with the Kurds becomes less necessary for either side.",
        "Elon Musk\u2019s private spaceflight company SpaceX pulled off a stunning feat Friday afternoon \u2014 launching one of its Falcon 9 rockets into space and then, minutes later, successfully landing the rocket\u2019s main component onto a drone ship floating in the ocean for reuse. Here\u2019s a GIF of the touchdown. The rocket was nearly dead on target when it landed upright. That\u2019s impressive considering it faced 50 mph winds and the platform is just the size of a football field: This is the first time SpaceX has successfully landed a rocket onto a floating platform, after four previous failures.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s immigration proposals have generally been imaginative, impractical, inhumane, and sometimes all three. But the plan Trump released this week on how he\u2019d get Mexico to pay for the wall along the southern border of the US hinged on something called remittances. Essentially the idea is to prevent Mexican immigrants in the US from sending money home to their families until the Mexican government agrees to pay for a border wall.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s loss in Wisconsin\u2019s primary on Tuesday has been called a \u201dmeltdown,\u201d a \u201dstunning blow,\u201d and a potential \u201dturning point\u201d in the Republican race. Indeed, Trump\u2019s press lately has been dreadful, his campaign has been abysmal at the delegate selection game, his chances in prediction markets have dropped, and his general election polling has grown more dismal than ever. But let\u2019s be clear \u2014 in the primaries, as of now, Trump is still winning. He could end up losing. Yet there are many reasons to believe he is still in a very good position going forward.",
        "Criminal justice reformers just got another reason to be skeptical of the Clintons. On Thursday, racial justice protesters interrupted a Bill Clinton rally for Hillary, as they have done in the past, to highlight Hillary\u2019s 1996 remarks about \u201dsuperpredators\u201d \u2014 a racially charged term \u2014 and the Clintons\u2019 role in perpetuating mass incarceration. Bill then attempted to respond to the protests. But his response seemed to miss the point: I don\u2019t know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got kids hopped up on crack and sent them out onto the street to murder other children.",
        "Pope Francis has released a broad statement on marriage and family life that calls for priests to be more compassionate, rejects dramatic changes or new reforms, and praises love, marriage, and family life in terms that seem destined to be quoted at weddings all over the world. The document \u2014 called \u201dAmoris Laetitia,\u201d or \u201dThe Joy of Love\u201d \u2014 is the result of two gatherings of Catholic bishops. And its content is typical of this pope: The change is more in the tone he uses than in the Catholic Church\u2019s policy on the issues themselves.",
        "The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has announced its decision: It will keep marijuana in the same legal, regulatory category as heroin \u2014 schedule 1. To many people, this is outrageous. Obviously, marijuana is nowhere as dangerous as heroin. And it\u2019s not more dangerous than schedule 2 drugs like cocaine and meth. So why the hell is pot schedule 1? But the classification doesn\u2019t mean that the federal government thinks of marijuana and heroin as equally dangerous drugs.",
        "More than 40 percent of people who should be paying back loans in the largest national student loan program are not making payments, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Josh Mitchell reported today. They\u2019re either falling behind on their scheduled payment plan or they\u2019ve entered a plan where they stop paying altogether and just let the interest accumulate. Both of these are bad financial choices. The high number of people who are opting for one or the other shows that far more Americans are struggling with student loans than usually show up in official statistics.",
        "Many of us know pneumatic tubes from the bank \u2014 but they have a surprisingly long history. As the above video shows, they\u2019ve been carrying people, mail, and even cats for more than 150 years. Since 1812 people have batted around the idea for pneumatic transport, and it was actually put into practice. The most famous experiments are probably New York\u2019s, where a pneumatic mail system ran from the 1890s through the 1950s and an experimental pneumatic subway was in limited operation from 1870 to 1873.",
        "The West African nation of Liberia has had many struggles in its long efforts to rebuild, first from its devastating civil war in the 1990s and early 2000s and, now, from Ebola. And one of the hardest struggles has been education. In 2013, after all 25, 000 high school students sitting state university entrance exams failed, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf admitted that the education system was \u201da mess\u201d and called for a complete overhaul.",
        "One of the biggest differences in the way I experience the 2016 Democratic primary compared with the 2008 or 2004 version is through the rise of Twitter. Twitter, which launched in 2006 but has grown to become a crucial part of any 2016 campaign, gives journalists like me quick and easy access to something it used to take hard legwork to get \u2014 direct and unmediated takes on the campaign from voters. We have constant, direct access to passionate supporters of candidates who aren\u2019t professional political pundits, campaign operatives, or interest group leaders.",
        "Another caucus, another win for Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senator has been called the winner of Wyoming\u2019s Democratic caucuses by multiple media outlets, continuing a recent winning streak. However, the exact amount of Wyoming\u2019s 14 delegates Sanders will come away will depend both on his final margin of victory \u2014 since Democratic contests all allot their delegates proportionally \u2014 and on the final outcome of the state Democratic convention next month. And early indications are that this isn\u2019t a complete blowout win for Sanders, like several other recent caucuses that he won by around 50 points.",
        "Fallujah was the first major Iraqi city captured by ISIS, initially seized back in January 2014. Today, the western Iraqi city is home to an estimated 90, 000 people \u2014 who, according to a Friday report, are trapped and facing a serious risk of starvation. And it seems that America\u2019s allies in Iraq are at least partly to blame. That\u2019s according to Iraq Oil Report, a subscription journalism service that does granular reporting on Iraqi affairs.",
        "The opioid painkiller and heroin epidemic led to a new record in drug overdose deaths in 2014 \u2014 more than 47, 000 overdose deaths that year alone, and nearly of them were linked to opioids and heroin. But what does that death toll really look like?",
        "I really like Fear the Walking Dead, AMC\u2019s prequel spinoff of its hit The Walking Dead. And I think the second season of Fear the Walking Dead, beginning Sunday, April 10, is a big step up from a first season I already enjoyed. Rating 3. 5 I don\u2019t terribly trust that reaction in myself. That may be due to my general weariness with Fear the Walking Dead\u2019s parent series, which just concluded a sixth season that featured occasional bright spots but lacked internal logic and a coherent plot.",
        "The Cut has the scoop on some truly shocking news: They said a novel about male sexual desire couldn\u2019t be written. But they didn\u2019t know John Colapinto. The Toast\u2019s Women Writers You Should Know series kicks off with a piece on Constance Fenimore Wilson: After her death, her reputation rapidly faded. Despite a series of obituaries that hailed her as America\u2019s foremost female writer, she was left out of the literary canon formed at the turn of the twentieth century. She wasn\u2019t alone: as the canon took shape, it was all male, eclipsing the contributions of women writers.",
        "Melissa McCarthy has reached the point Bill Murray was at in the 1980s and Jim Carrey was at in the 1990s, where the entire premise of a film can be, \u201dWouldn\u2019t you like to see this actor playing this particular part?\u201d \u2014 and so long as the answer is \u201dyes,\u201d it will work. Rating 2 The Boss, if nothing else, proves this. It doesn\u2019t have a story beyond, \u201dWhat if Melissa McCarthy played the boss?\u201d That it almost succeeds is a testament to her strengths as a performer and the rest of the game ensemble cast.",
        "The data visualization website Polygraph has unveiled a deep dive into the gender biases of more than 2, 000 movies with what the site claims is \u201darguably the largest undertaking of script analysis, ever.\u201d To complete its study, Polygraph character names with actor data from IMDB, including gender and age. The resulting collection of interactive infographics the site compiled from its findings adds statistical research to what you might think of as common wisdom: Men have more speaking roles in Hollywood than women do. What this looks like in actual practice is kind of staggering.",
        "Happy Endings \u2014 a but comedy about six friends living in Chicago \u2014 premiered on April 13, 2011. The series ran for just three seasons, with plenty of obstacles in its way: Season one aired completely out of order, and over the course of Happy Endings\u2019 run, it switched time slots multiple times while its network, ABC, put only minimal effort into its publicity and marketing. As star Eliza Coupe told Complex, which recently compiled an oral history of the show, \u201dNobody promoted us, we never had any publicity."
