Vox Sentences is written by Dylan Matthews and Dara Lind. TOP NEWS Focusing on the family Alex Images Pope Francis released his treatise on the family, \u201dAmoris Laetitia,\u201d on Friday after two years of conferences and deliberation. [Vatican Pope Francis] The treatise doesn\u2019t radically change Catholic doctrine.",
        "As part of an editorial calling for Republicans to stop Donald Trump from becoming their presidential nominee, the Boston Globe on Sunday imagined what covering a President Trump would be like on its front page. The results are horrifying: The Globe took some editorial liberties with how Trump\u2019s plans would impact the US, including the potential for riots, markets crashing, and the military refusing to obey Trump\u2019s orders. The Globe\u2019s editorial board explained: It is an exercise in taking a man at his word.",
        "In 2008, a Syrian truck driver was faithfully following his satellite navigation system and ended up 1, 600 miles away from where he was supposed to be. He\u2019d meant to go to Gibraltar, off the south coast of Spain. He arrived at Gibraltar Point, England, surrounded by a group of befuddled birdwatchers. That\u2019s a pretty extreme blunder.",

Coastal dead zones, global warming, excess algae blooms, acid rain, ocean acidification, smog, impaired drinking water quality, an expanding ozone hole, and biodiversity loss. Seemingly diverse problems, but a common thread connects them: human disruption of how a single chemical element, nitrogen, interacts with the environment.",
        "Hillary Clinton is on a bit of a losing streak. In the past few weeks, Clinton, who still has a commanding lead in pledged delegates, has lost seven of the past eight states to Bernie Sanders. And looming in the distance is Clinton and Sanders\u2019s home state of New York and its 247 pledged delegates (she lives there and served as a senator there from 2001 to 2009; Sanders was born in Brooklyn).",
        "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice came out of the gate torching records. The film\u2019s box office haul was incongruent with its critical reception \u2014 it made hundreds of millions of dollars despite being panned by critics. For a second there it looked like fans were out to prove critics wrong and prove director Zack Snyder, who had claimed he made a movie for comic fans and not critics, right. Then it stalled.",
        "Warning: Spoilers for the entirety of Catastrophe, season two, follow. It\u2019s good, though! Watch it! The opening scene of Catastrophe\u2019s second season \u2014 which dropped in its entirety on Amazon on April 8 \u2014 is all it takes to remember that this show isn\u2019t telling the same marriage story you\u2019ve heard so many times before. \u201dDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d Sharon, curled up in bed around her enormous, stomach, snarls at her husband. \u201dIf you touch me, I\u2019m gonna scream,\u201d Rob spits at her, furious.

        "When the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists released the trove of data on secret financial dealings now known as the Panama Papers, it claimed it linked 140 politicians from more than 50 countries to secret offshore accounts. In the eight days since, the revelations have ended one political career \u2014 that of the prime minister of Iceland \u2014 and have revealed new scandals in dozens of other countries.

        "Some Hollywood actors and actresses, bless their souls, just don\u2019t have what it takes to please a film critic. On the silver screen, they laugh. They cry. They wince dramatically, as if detecting the aroma of bacon. And when their performance is done, a stodgy man at the Chicago Tribune or a curmudgeonly woman at the New York Times deems it \u201d juvenile\u201d or \u201dless thrilling than an audit.\u201d Often this criticism is .",
        "Today marks the end of a meteorological era. For more than a century, the National Weather Service\u2019s forecasts have been sent out in LOUD FONT. It gave their storm and blizzard warnings a nice apocalyptic feel. Like so: The tradition dated back to 1849, when the NWS first started pounding out forecasts via telegraph. And for much of the 20th century, weather reports were sent via teleprinters, which only allowed capital letters. But the era of typographical is now coming to a close.",
        "Unintended consequences are a constant in politics, and many veteran Democrats talk about the prison boom of the late 20th century as if it\u2019s an example of them. Speaking about the \u201994 crime bill last May, for example, Bill Clinton said, \u201dThe problem [with] the way it was written and implemented is we cast too wide a net and we had too many people in prison,\u201d as if they\u2019d intended to fight crime but hadn\u2019t intended to end up with quite so many people behind bars.",
        "There\u2019s new research out today that shows the life expectancy gap between the rich and the poor in America is wide and growing \u2014 but not necessarily inevitable. For the study, published today in JAMA, a group of researchers led by Stanford University economist Raj Chetty analyzed income data for the US population from 1. 4 billion tax records between 1999 and 2014. They then compared it with mortality data from Social Security Administration death records. What they found was a startling divide in longevity between America\u2019s richest and poorest.",
        "Hillary Clinton is the candidate of the Democratic Party\u2019s establishment. Bernie Sanders is the candidate of its progressive, leftward wing. Right? That\u2019s certainly how the two candidates are running. But the exit polls in states that have voted so far show it might be a bit more complicated. Among the questions asked by exit pollsters is whether voters want the next president to continue President Barack Obama\u2019s policies, be more liberal than Obama, or be less liberal.",
        "As Uber has come to dominate the industry, it\u2019s also come under fire for sexual assault complaints against its drivers. And while the platform makes it shockingly easy for women passengers \u2014 and drivers \u2014 to be stalked or harassed, the problem isn\u2019t unique to Uber. Other services like Lyft, not to mention regular taxis, also have issues with sexual harassment and assault. That\u2019s why one former Uber driver, Michael Pelletz, decided to create a service. It\u2019s called Chariot for Women, it\u2019s based in Boston, and it\u2019s scheduled to debut nationwide on April 19.",

The law struck down local nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ people, and it bars trans people from using the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity in schools and government buildings.",
        "Bernie Sanders won Michigan in a shocking upset largely because he capitalized on a grassroots backlash against American free trade deals. That, at least, is how the Vermont senator\u2019s surprise victory was interpreted by the New York Times, CNN, US News & World Report, the Nation, and scores of other news outlets (including Vox). Similar interpretations followed Sanders\u2019s big victory in Wisconsin on Tuesday, with Sanders himself arguing that Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201dsupport for corporate trade deals\u201d was a key ingredient in her defeat there.",
        "Originally published on Ensia. People in developed countries rarely think of weather in terms. But millions in the developing world have no choice but to do so. The global rich have stable governments, savings accounts, insurance, and more to fall back on when disaster strikes. People in poorer countries don\u2019t, so they\u2019re often faced with tough decisions in times of drought: Sell the only ox for food and plow by hand next year? Take the kids out of school and put them to work chopping firewood for extra cash?",

        "Paul Ryan is not officially running for president, but he\u2019s sure acting like a presidential candidate. He\u2019s hoping he can frame himself as a unifying figure in the Republican race for the nomination, a Republican who isn\u2019t an unpredictable demagogue like Donald Trump, an ideological extremist like Ted Cruz, or a repeated failure as a candidate like John Kasich. \u201dThe youthful, House Speaker combines Ted Cruz\u2019s intellectual conservatism with John Kasich\u2019s moderate congressional track record, a touch of a reformist impulse, plus the added bonus of not being Donald Trump,\u201d Vanity Fair\u2019s Tina Nguyen summarizes.",
        "In the 1980s, the United States had two major hubs of technology innovation. Everyone knows about Silicon Valley, but the East Coast had a \u201dSilicon Valley\u201d of its own, located along Route 128 in the suburbs of Boston. When Gov. Michael Dukakis touted the \u201dMassachusetts Miracle\u201d in his 1988 presidential campaign, he was largely talking about Boston\u2019s boom. Unfortunately, the Massachusetts Miracle didn\u2019t last. During the 1990s, Silicon Valley boomed while Route 128 companies faltered. And researchers have pointed to a surprising culprit: Massachusetts law strictly enforces agreements that prohibit employees from taking jobs at competing companies.",
        "Women earn less than men across the board: 79 cents for every $1, according to the latest data. But that\u2019s not true in every job \u2014 and in the most unequal professions, the wage gap can be even bigger. The Center for American Progress in 2015 found the most and least equal professions, as measured by women\u2019s median weekly earnings as a percentage of men\u2019s, according to wage data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
        "America\u2019s Test Kitchen has long taken a highly scientific approach to developing recipes for home cooks. Every dish outlined in the brand\u2019s magazines, books, and TV show has been methodically and obsessively tested by a staff of cooks and tasters, who sometimes try up to 100 iterations. The method isn\u2019t cheap; each recipe costs about $11, 000 to produce, explained Dan Souza, a food science expert with ATK.",
        "We usually only pay attention to viruses when they\u2019re making us sick or ravaging large swaths of humanity. We don\u2019t often wonder at their intricate structures or admire their symmetrical beauty. That\u2019s what makes Eleanor Lutz\u2019s homage to viruses so striking. A PhD student in biology at the University of Washington by day and graphic artist by night, Lutz was inspired to pay tribute to viruses when she realized how \u201dsurprisingly symmetrical\u201d they are. \u201dI love them because they remind me of a biological version of snowflakes,\u201d she writes.",

        "Alpha Centauri, the second closest star to Earth, is 4. 37 away. That\u2019s a tantalizingly close neighbor in an observable universe some 93 billion wide. As we run out of objects to explore in our own solar system, it\u2019s among the most tempting places to visit. Still, even our most ambitious spacecraft could never reach it in our lifetimes. The spacecraft New Horizons, which flew by Pluto last year, flies at around 33, 000 miles per hour. That means it would take around 20, 000 years to send a craft like it to Alpha Centauri.",
        "Tuesday is Free Cone Day at Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream parlors \u2014 an event that for 37 years has enticed people to stand in long lines for something they\u2019d otherwise pay only a few dollars for. And, Free Cone Day grinch that I am, I started to wonder: How much is that time really costing you? Even if you don\u2019t pay for the ice cream itself, you\u2019re paying for the time you spend standing in line to get it. Economists call this opportunity cost \u2014 the value of something you\u2019re giving up in order to pursue another option.",
        "Ohio Gov. John Kasich may be running a distant third in the primary, but he\u2019s the Republican presidential candidate best positioned to beat Hillary Clinton in a general election matchup. That\u2019s according to new projections released today by the nonpartisan technology and media company Morning Consult, which also found that Donald Trump and Ted Cruz would lose to Clinton in a general election. In its polling over the past four months, Morning Consult has asked more than 44, 000 registered voters across the country about which presidential candidate they\u2019d prefer in a general election.",
        "On Wednesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) introduced a bill that would make doing taxes vastly easier for Americans \u2014 and would strongly push back against the tax prep industry\u2019s attempts to keep taxes difficult. The Tax Filing Simplification Act of 2016 would order the IRS to create a free online tax preparation and filing service comparable to TurboTax or other commercial programs. Moreover, it bans the agency from working with the tax prep companies, as it\u2019s been doing for years.",
        "Most people know that crude oil prices are hugely consequential for the global economy. Soar too high and they trigger recessions. Plunge too low, too fast and they sow chaos in nations. Even squiggles can roil markets. Yet despite their vast importance, few experts seem able to reliably predict where oil prices will go next. Financial markets and policymakers are perpetually surprised by large swings. The ginormous surge in the 2000s \u2014 when China\u2019s appetite for crude pushed prices from $30 per barrel in 2003 to $140 per barrel in 2008 \u2014 stunned plenty of analysts."
