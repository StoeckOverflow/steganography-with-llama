        "As Cleveland prepares to host the Republican National Convention this summer, it\u2019s bidding on millions of dollars of security equipment and tactical gear for its police. Cleveland and Philadelphia, which will host the Democratic convention, each received $50 million in federal money to cover the security costs associated with the conventions. Cleveland projects to spend $20 million of that on security equipment and supplies and $30 million on \u201d expenditures.\u201d Philadelphia has not yet announced how it will use the money. In March, Cleveland opened its bids for various security supplies. And the sheer quantity of equipment is staggering.",
        "The US coal industry is imploding. And here\u2019s the biggest casualty yet: Peabody Energy, the world\u2019s largest coal company, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in St. Louis on Wednesday. It\u2019s hard to overstate what a seismic shift this is. Peabody has been a giant in the mining industry seemingly forever, after starting out in Chicago in 1880 with just a wagon and two mules. A decade ago, coal provided fully half of America\u2019s electricity, much of it dug up by Peabody in Illinois, Kentucky, Wyoming, Colorado.",
        "The dead can speak to us. I know I hear them. I\u2019m listening right now to the voice of my grandpa, which sounds thin and warbled, liked a clogged whistle. \u201dYou should become a doctor,\u201d he\u2019s saying. When Grandpa was alive, my future employment was just about the only topic we discussed. That wasn\u2019t because we didn\u2019t see each other often (he lived a few miles away) or because he died when I was 14. It\u2019s because the topic of whether I would pursue medicine came up a lot.",
        "With the crucial New York primary approaching, Hillary Clinton tried out a new attack against Bernie Sanders\u2019s gun record at an event in Port Washington, New York: [Sanders] frequently says, \u201dWe\u2019re a small, rural state, we have no gun laws.\u201d Here\u2019s what I want you to know: Most of the guns that are used in crimes and violence and killings in New York come from out of state. And the state that has the highest per capita number of those guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from Vermont.",

        "On Monday and Tuesday, Russian planes and helicopters flew very, very close to the USS Donald Cole, a destroyer operating in the Baltic Sea. How close? This close: The Russian planes were flying at the US ship in the same way they would be if they were conducting an attack run. Thankfully, they were unarmed \u2014 but the act was needlessly, dangerously provocative. What\u2019s more, Russia has been doing this for years, even buzzing the Donald Cook roughly 12 times two years ago, when it was in the Black Sea. Why does this keep happening?",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s comments on how people on dates should split the bill \u2014 made in an interview with Prachi Gupta for Cosmopolitan \u2014 are hilariously nuanced, and a weirdly great look into how she approaches public policy: Hillary\u2019s answer here is hilariously but it is also correct. https: . via @GrahamDavidA pic. twitter. \u2014 Ruth Graham (@publicroad) April 13, 2016 Bill splitting is an issue where people have weirdly doctrinaire, positions, whether it\u2019s \u201dmen should always pay,\u201d \u201dyou should always split,\u201d \u201dthe person doing the should always pay,\u201d or whatever.",
        "If it feels like outside groups have an enormous amount of influence on Republican groups, that\u2019s because they do. Or they at least have a huge share of the money, according to new research from Theda Skocpol, an influential Harvard University political scientist. The Republican Party\u2019s official organs have seen the amount of money at their disposal decline by hundreds of millions of dollars.",
        "Bernie Sanders says his platform makes financial sense for most Americans. For example, his campaign says Sanders\u2019s health care system would save an average family of four almost $6, 000 per year. But in order to pay for his proposed programs, Sanders needs to increase taxes on virtually everyone in America. So if you\u2019re a voter, the question is simple: Are you willing to pay more taxes for his proposals, like nationalized health care and free public college tuition? How much more?",
        "On Tuesday, Taiwanese media lit up with a video taken far away in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi. It appears to show a group of 15 Taiwanese citizens inside a Nairobi jail cell, doing something that prisoners don\u2019t often do: barricading the door to keep themselves locked in. The video, apparently taken by one of the Taiwanese, cuts off after a few seconds.",
        "Canada\u2019s law legalizing suicide \u2014 which allows doctors to help terminally ill patients end their own lives \u2014 will only apply to people who live in Canada, according to the Associated Press.

        "If you\u2019ve ever wondered how there could possibly be enough local farmers to support all the restaurants cropping up across America, an investigation from the Tampa Bay Times\u2019 Laura Reiley has one possible answer: There may not be enough.

        "Bernie Sanders has a very clear theory of what is wrong with Hillary Clinton: She is less than he is. She is less of a conviction politician, less politically daring, less consistent in her record, and more beholden to interests that benefit from the status quo. Agree or not, that\u2019s what he\u2019s saying. You don\u2019t need to agree with it or intend to vote for him to understand it and be able to repeat it coherently. Clinton, by contrast, is all over the map.",
        "The viciousness of the 2016 Democratic primary is sometimes exaggerated. Yes, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have traded some personal attacks, but anyone who remembers the Dick Dean war of late 2003 knows that it can get much, much, worse. That being said, Thursday night\u2019s CNN debate in Brooklyn took this cycle a bit closer to that level of venom. It was pointed and hostile in a way that no matchup to date has been.",
        "Just a few days from the New York primary, the New York Post has released its endorsement in the Republican race: Donald Trump. Well, except the candidate the Post endorsed doesn\u2019t really seem like Trump at all. The Post seems to be betting on President Trump being nothing like the Trump on the campaign trail. The Post editorial board wrote: Should he win the nomination, we expect Trump to pivot \u2014 not just on the issues, but in his manner. The Trump needs to be more presidential: better informed on policy, more and less .",
        "When it takes up the question of whether President Obama\u2019s 2014 immigration executive actions were constitutional, the Supreme Court will throw out its typical playbook. United States v. Texas is one of the most \u2014 if not the most \u2014 important cases before the highest court this term. It\u2019s certainly the most important immigration case the Supreme Court has taken up in a generation (or, arguably, a century). And the Court is treating it accordingly.",
        "This November, residents of Washington, DC, will vote on whether the District should become the 51st state. The initiative is very likely to pass, given that statehood polls very well in DC. But it also very likely won\u2019t go into effect: The results aren\u2019t legally binding, and the referendum would require congressional approval \u2014 something that\u2019s almost certainly not going to happen. Still, DC\u2019s lack of statehood affects every single law, even the budget, passed by the DC Council and voters.",
        "Bernie Sanders has spent months hammering Hillary Clinton for accepting millions of dollars in speaking fees from Wall Street in the runup to her presidential bid, while refusing to release transcripts of the speeches to the public. Sanders has done it so many times, he\u2019s even come up with a favorite joke: \u201dI am going to release all of the transcripts of the speeches that I gave on Wall Street behind closed doors,\u201d Sanders said again during a Democratic debate Thursday night on CNN. \u201dThere were no speeches.\u201d The crowd roared.",
        "Bernie Sanders did something previously unheard of in last night\u2019s CNN debate: He stood up for Palestinians\u2019 humanity. \u201dAs somebody who is 100 percent in the long run,\u201d Sanders said, \u201dwe are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity.\u201d Related Read Clinton and Sanders\u2019s remarkable exchange on For many, this seems banal: Sanders is asserting that the US needs to understand Israeli and Palestinian beliefs to ultimately resolve the conflict.

        "The Senate\u2019s revised bipartisan criminal justice reform bill, spearheaded by Sen. Chuck Grassley ( ) suggests at least some federal lawmakers have truly learned nothing from the failures of the war on drugs. In an effort to make the bill more palatable to conservatives, Reuter reports that the Senate is making several changes. The good news is it still keeps many of the provisions that let nonviolent offenders, including those imprisoned or charged for drug crimes, get an early release or shorter sentence.",
        "A lot of people worry that robots \u2014 or more generally, software and automation \u2014 will take everyone\u2019s job. One study found that almost half of US jobs are capable of being automated over the next two decades. But automating routine jobs isn\u2019t something that might happen in the future. To a large extent, it\u2019s something that already happened. Today, just 8 percent of American workers work in the manufacturing sector \u2014 less than a third of the share 50 years ago.",
        "When we think about productivity in an economy, we are normally referring to the output of human workers. But some segments of the economy also feature a nonhuman labor force.    Dairy cows, for example, are a key part of the milk industry. And according to this striking chart from the US Department of Agriculture, their productivity has surged over the past generation:            Cow wages, presumably, have not increased commensurately during this period.",
