        "WASHINGTON \u2014 Stepping into the midday sunlight after Monday\u2019s oral arguments in the Supreme Court immigration case United States v. Texas was like stepping out of the pages of a law book into the world of the living. Outside, hundreds of demonstrators were chanting, singing, shouting through megaphones, and holding signs \u2014 urging the Court\u2019s eight justices to let the Obama administration go through with its plans to allow 4. 5 million unauthorized immigrants to apply for protection from deportation and work permits.",
        "It\u2019s easy to get ridiculously excited about solar power these days. The panels keep getting cheaper as technology improves. Large photovoltaic arrays are sprouting up around the globe. Sure, solar still produces only 1 percent of the world\u2019s electricity, but it\u2019s growing at rates each year. So with all this momentum, you\u2019d think the solar industry could kick back and celebrate, right? Domination is only a matter of time! Well \u2026 not so fast.",
        "A shocking new investigation has found that the Pentagon misled Congress while trying to block a major reform of the way military sexual assault cases are prosecuted. \u201dOur analysis reveals that the Pentagon exaggerated and distorted the facts in order to undermine fundamental reform of the military justice system,\u201d reads a new report released Monday by the victim advocacy group Protect Our Defenders and confirmed by an Associated Press investigation. It\u2019s not clear who exactly at the Pentagon was responsible for this. The inaccurate testimony came from Adm.",
        "If Democrats were heading into a national primary election in late April, journalists would be writing that Bernie Sanders has drastically narrowed Hillary Clinton\u2019s lead in the polls. The good news for Clinton would be that she still holds a lead. The bad news would be that Sanders\u2019s ascent, while not strictly relentless, has been fairly steady over time. He started the race a much more obscure figure than Clinton, and over time he keeps gaining on her. Journalists generally aren\u2019t writing this story, because we\u2019re not heading for a national primary.",
        "Later today in Nevada, Hillary Clinton is scheduled to deliver a speech on the subject of \u201dDonald Trump and his advisors\u2019 embrace of the disturbing \u2019 \u2019 political philosophy\u201d that she characterizes as \u201dembracing extremism and presenting a divisive and dystopian view of America which should concern all Americans, regardless of party.\u201d That\u2019s a striking level of prominence for a movement that until recently was extremely obscure. A movement lurking in Reddit and 4chan threads and in community blogs and forums, a movement of who openly argue that democracy is a joke.",
        "In the season one finale of The Magicians, a drama based on the books about a group of students at a magical university, there\u2019s a moment when the show\u2019s protagonist begins to doubt that he\u2019s the hero of his own story. Previously, Quentin Coldwater (Jason Ralph) was entirely convinced of his heroism; he had successfully traveled to the magical land he\u2019d grown up dreaming of, and that land\u2019s god had laid its hands on him and told him he was the one who was meant to save the world. He was the main character.",
        "Tax Day is a horror for many procrastinators. For many people, a little procrastination isn\u2019t harmful \u2014 like 15 minutes lost in Facebook or putting off doing the laundry for a few days. But then there are things like taxes. And all the people who keep meaning to start saving for retirement, but never do. And people with obesity or diabetes who constantly tell themselves, \u201dI\u2019ll start eating right tomorrow\u201d \u2014 but never do. For some people, procrastination creates huge problems at work, at school, and at home.",
        "About half of Americans believe their taxes are too high, but with virtually any demographic group, you can find something they are willing to pay more for. But that something is different for everyone. So the week of April 4, we polled about 1, 000 people in partnership with the nonpartisan media and technology company Morning Consult to ask if voters would be willing to pay more taxes to fund various government functions. You can see the results of that poll here.",
        "If the US presidential election were held in Russia today, the next president would be \u2026 Donald Trump. Those are the results of new survey research by YouGov. It found Russia is the only country in the G20, the international forum of 20 of the world\u2019s major economies, that prefers Trump to Hillary Clinton: At the same time, Mexico really doesn\u2019t like Trump, preferring Clinton by a whopping 54 percentage points. The findings aren\u2019t really surprising. Much of the Russian foreign policy establishment doesn\u2019t like Clinton.",
        "As New York prepares to vote on Tuesday, Senator Bernie Sanders has an ally trying to move the needle: renowned filmmaker Spike Lee, who, like Sanders, grew up in Brooklyn. Lee has made a ad for Sanders, an unusual move for a major filmmaker: Despite Lee\u2019s involvement, the result looks pretty conventional. It\u2019s recognizably a political ad, following the usual trope of interspersing Sanders\u2019s speeches with testimonials from his supporters. Lee highlights supporters who are people of color \u2014 important going into the New York primary because Sanders has struggled with nonwhite voters in other states.",
        "This weekend marks the beginning of the 2016 NBA playoffs, the pinnacle of professional basketball and thus human athletic endeavor in general. And it\u2019s no ordinary year in playoff basketball. This year\u2019s tournament features an iteration of the Golden State Warriors that is likely the single greatest basketball team ever assembled. Their record during the regular season is the best put forth by any team in history, and more sophisticated analysis suggests the naive take is right \u2014 no team has ever been better.",
        "Alcohol is involved in more deaths than all illicit drugs combined in the US. At a death toll of 88, 000 each year, tobacco is the only drug that kills more people, at a shocking toll of 480, 000 deaths annually. But Prohibition, which barred the sale of alcohol from 1920 to 1933, is widely regarded as a failure. So what can policymakers do to stop the massive death toll from alcohol? A new study published in The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse affirms one of the most common policy proposals: a higher alcohol tax.",

TOP NEWS In which the Supreme Court tries to make sense of immigration law without going utterly mad Alex Images On Monday, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the lawsuit filed by 26 states over President Obama\u2019s 2014 executive actions on immigration \u2014 which would have protected up to 4. 5 million unauthorized immigrants from deportation if they\u2019d ever been implemented.",
        "New Yorkers will wait in line for hours for a good brunch. Waiting in line to vote? Not so much. Only 25 percent of New York state\u2019s registered voters turned out in the 2014 gubernatorial race. In fact, the New York Public Interest Research Group\u2019s legislative director Blair Horner called voter turnout in the state \u201dlousy.\u201d And voter apathy isn\u2019t just a problem during the midterm years. In 2008, only 61 percent of registered New York City residents went to the polls \u2014 the worst turnout for any major American city. And the problem is only getting worse.",
        "Hamilton just won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for drama, in a move that surprised absolutely no one. While the plays it was up against \u2014 The Humans and Gloria \u2014 were both and admired, only Hamilton was written by a genius. It became a foregone conclusion a long time ago that Hamilton would be riding its tidal wave of critical acclaim straight to the Pulitzers. It\u2019s a historic victory in a lot of ways, but here\u2019s one of them: Hamilton is the ninth musical ever to win a Pulitzer in the 99 years of the awards\u2019 history.",
        "Uber made waves from its very first days, sparking not just competitors like Lyft but an endless parade of \u201don demand\u201d apps promising to use smartphones to connect consumers and couriers to do almost everything. Uber itself is still doing well, but the \u201dUber for X\u201d party seems to be over, according to Scott Martin at the Wall Street Journal: Others startups, such as service SpoonRocket Inc. weren\u2019t as lucky and went belly up. The company called it quits in March after raising $13. 5 million in funding.",
        "Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin went through one of his ritual Direct Line shows: a marathon covering everything from the state of the roads in Omsk (they\u2019re terrible) to whether he swears (yes, but only to himself). It was a pretty lackluster spectacle this time; Putin himself seeming bored. But the event, however staged and predictable, performed a function common to his public appearances: furthering the myth \u2014 dominant in both in his own country and the West \u2014 that Putin is Russia, the unquestioned and solitary master of his realm. But it\u2019s not true.",
        "> (Javier ) With every disease outbreak, researchers try to figure out how far \u2014 and how fast \u2014 a virus is likely to spread through a population. To do that, they use a number called an \u201dR naught,\u201d or R0. Most simply, the figure refers to how many other people one sick person is likely to infect on average in a group that\u2019s susceptible to the disease. The number is super important in the context of public health because it foretells how big and deadly an outbreak will be.",
        "Ask most Americans how the primaries work, and their answer would be simple: Members of both parties vote for the candidate they like best, and that candidate becomes the party\u2019s nominee. That answer isn\u2019t even close to correct. In truth, the primary system is strange, inconsistent, and occasionally rigged.",
        "The hashtag #WhenIWas started trending nationwide on Twitter Tuesday as women poured out their stories of sexual harassment and abuse from childhood and adolescence. It started with a series of tweets from Everyday Sexism, a feminist project dedicated to cataloguing women\u2019s daily experiences with sexual harassment, discrimination, and assault. #WhenIWas quickly went viral and had about 30, 000 tweets by early Tuesday afternoon. Some women tweeted horrifying stories of sexual harassment and assault from when they were children or young teenagers. Too many stories involved teachers who were either indifferent to the harassment of girls or actively enabled it.",
        "On Monday, Iraqi government ministries located in Baghdad\u2019s heavily fortified Green Zone were closed and staff was evacuated out of fear of riots from thousands of protesters led by the influential Shia cleric and militia leader turned politician Muqtada . The protests over perceived corruption and mismanagement by the government of Prime Minister Haider have been running off and on since August, and restarted most recently on Friday. They do not appear to have grown violent, but security forces have deployed to protect government buildings.",
        "As markets go, the market for retirement savings is pretty awful. In a good world, there just wouldn\u2019t be much money to be made on helping people sock money away in 401( k)s and IRAs. The only retirement investment advice anyone really needs fits on a index card: The basics are really simple.",
        "\u201dSome firms are super successful, posting high returns year after year after year, and other firms are pretty mediocre. Of course, that\u2019s always true \u2026 but the gap between them has grown enormously. Combine that with the fact that if you work for a more successful company, you will be paid more even if you\u2019re doing exactly the same job and have exactly the same skills you would\u2019ve brought to a less successful company.",
        "The water in Flint, Michigan, still isn\u2019t getting back to normal. And the political crisis brought about by national attention to the city\u2019s lead problem shows no signs of abating either. So Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder is trying to kill two birds with one stone: He announced that he\u2019d be drinking (filtered) water from Flint for 30 days to to try to restore residents\u2019 confidence. But Snyder could struggle to get this message across for both political and scientific reasons.",
        "Will marijuana legalization in Colorado cause pot use and abuse to skyrocket, along with other problems associated with cannabis? Or will it be a net gain, creating new jobs in a burgeoning industry while cutting arrests for a relatively mild drug? A new report from Colorado finds a little bit of the first and a little bit of the second.",
        "\u201dYou can\u2019t unfeel the Bern once you feel the Bern,\u201d the Bernie Sanders supporter said, showing off her tattoo of the presidential candidate. That was one of the several memorable moments that came from Full Frontal host Samantha Bee\u2019s interview with Sanders supporters, in which she tried to capture why they seem to have a faith in Sanders and American politics that she lacks. \u201dI\u2019m not here to bash Bernie,\u201d Bee said.",
        "Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt isn\u2019t bulletproof. Though it mostly charmed and sparkled in its first season, the Netflix sitcom from Tina Fey and Robert Carlock came under scrutiny for how it treated race. In particular, many people felt the show bungled its portrayal of Jacqueline Voorhees\u2019s (Jane Krakowski) Native American ancestry.",
        "Climate change is a very large, very urgent problem. This has led to a peculiar and singularly unproductive fight within the climate community. Those who focus on the \u201durgent\u201d part say that the overwhelming priority should be to deploy existing technologies. We simply don\u2019t have time to wait for energy breakthroughs or miracles, they say. Time is up; we have to do as much as we can with the technology we have, as fast as possible.",
        "June 6, 2005, seemed to be a triumphant moment for Intel. The chipmaker was already dominating the market for processors that powered PCs. Then Steve Jobs took the stage at Apple\u2019s World Wide Developers Conference to announce that he was switching the main Windows alternative, Macintosh computers, to Intel chips as well. The announcement cemented Intel\u2019s status as the leading company of the PC era. There was just one problem: The PC era was about to end. Apple was already working on the iPhone, which would usher in the modern smartphone era.",
        "Three people are finally facing criminal charges in the Flint water crisis: two state officials and one city employee who, according to Michigan\u2019s attorney general, covered up the high levels of lead in the city\u2019s water and stopped investigations into other health risks. Arguments about who\u2019s to blame for the Flint crisis have focused on the emergency managers who oversaw the switch to river water; the state Department of Environmental Quality; and Gov. Rick Snyder himself, who pushed for stronger emergency manager laws that some say enabled the crisis."
