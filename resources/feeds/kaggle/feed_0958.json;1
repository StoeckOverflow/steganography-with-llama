        "Toward the end of Prohibition, John D. Rockefeller Jr. the powerful businessman who supported the US ban on alcohol, admitted defeat. Seeing the effect Prohibition had on America, he concluded that the policy was doomed. So in the 1930s, he underwrote a study that laid out how to legalize alcohol while strictly regulating it. The study shapes alcohol policy to this day, as Garrett Peck explained for Reason. Today, opponents of marijuana legalization are in a similar position as Rockefeller \u2014 but they don\u2019t want to admit it.",
        "Gordon Hanson is an economist at the University of California San Diego, and you\u2019d expect him to be a fierce critic of free trade. He\u2019s a of perhaps the most famous study showing the downside of trade for American workers, which concluded that exports from China in the 1990s and 2000s cost the US a huge number of manufacturing jobs. Yet Hanson is anything but . Those job losses, Hanson told me, were inevitable so long as rich countries were willing to trade with relatively poorer countries like China.",
        "Even in defeat in New York and most likely in the overall quest for the 2016 Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders has already won in another, perhaps more important way: His brand of politics is the future of the Democratic Party. Sanders is the overwhelming choice of young voters, scoring 67 percent of voters under 30 in New York even while losing overall amidst a set of election rules that were highly unfavorable to his cause. National Reuters polls now show him with a large edge over Clinton with voters below the age of 40.",
        "Did Saudi Arabia, an American ally but a country that supports extremists, have a hand in the attacks of September 11, 2001? When Americans talk about this question, they will often mention a section of a 2002 congressional report, which has achieved such infamy that it is described only as \u201dthe 28 pages.\u201d Those pages are in the news again now, resurfacing debate in the US over Saudi Arabia and . Here is what we know about that document and about the question of Saudi involvement in .",
        "One of the greenest, most environmentally friendly moves that big cities like New York or San Francisco or Chicago can make is to increase housing density and allow more people to live in them. And yet, bizarrely, few people seem to think of this as an \u201denvironmental\u201d policy. But it is! And it\u2019s hugely significant. In fact, we can illustrate just how significant by taking a closer look at San Francisco\u2019s new solar law. This week, San Francisco became the first major US city to require solar panels on all new buildings that have 10 floors or less.",

Ever since then, senior Obama administration officials have been looking for ways to improve the government\u2019s IT capabilities \u2014 creating two new agencies for that purpose in 2014.

        "North Carolina is catching a lot of heat for its controversial law barring transgender people from using bathrooms in schools and government facilities that correspond with their gender identity. But it turns out North Carolina is not so unique. At least 15 other states have tried to pass, or are currently considering, similar measures. These include Texas, South Dakota, Missouri, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin, as well as Tennessee, where lawmakers again decided to push the bill to a later session.",

        "Presidential campaign staff come and go; it\u2019s the nature of the operative\u2019s grueling lifestyle. But last week\u2019s suspension of Simone Zimmerman, Bernie Sanders\u2019s Jewish outreach coordinator, was very, very different. For one thing, she was only at the job for two days. Her \u201dsuspension\u201d wasn\u2019t about burnout; it was the result of a controversy that tapped into a much larger debate over nature of the Sanders campaign and the future of the American Jewish community\u2019s approach to Israel.",

This will make, obviously, no practical difference in anyone\u2019s life, but you may have heard or read a lot about it anyway. This is precisely because it\u2019s a purely symbolic question rather than a pragmatic one \u2014 it touches some of the deepest nerves in American politics.",
        "Yesterday afternoon, the US Treasury announced that Harriet Tubman (who escaped slavery and became an abolitionist) will replace Andrew Jackson (who reputedly owned 300 slaves) on the front of the $20 bill. Some would call that sweet justice, but the decision to include a woman on our paper currency is long overdue, especially when compared to other countries. We spent the past week compiling data on the world\u2019s 180 recognized currencies, with several questions in mind: How many countries\u2019 currencies feature at least one woman? What percentage of the world\u2019s money pictures a woman?",

        "Since the release of the Panama Papers, every day has brought on a new development. The sheer scale of the leaks is staggering \u2014 nearly 100 times more data than when Wikileaks released nearly 3 million US diplomatic cables. The papers themselves include millions of leaked documents that reveal just how pervasive tax avoidance is among the world\u2019s most powerful and wealthy.

        "It\u2019s fun to ponder a future filled with cars, a world with breezy commutes where robot navigators have made deadly crashes a thing of the past. But how far off is that future, really? Last month, Google suggested that this driverless utopia may actually be much further away than many people may realize.

Just this Sunday, one house of Brazil\u2019s Congress voted to impeach her. The story behind Rousseff\u2019s collapse is extraordinary \u2014 but also a bit complicated.

        "The \u201delectability\u201d question has loomed large in discussion of the Democratic primary even though it hasn\u2019t been explicitly discussed much by the candidates. Hillary Clinton\u2019s supporters routinely raise it as a key problem with Bernie Sanders\u2019 aspirations. Sanders\u2019 supporters, meanwhile, are increasingly frustrated that their candidate gets no credit from these pundits for performing significantly better than Clinton in polling against possible GOP contenders.",
        "One point that autistic people like myself have been hammering since the rise of the autism rights movement is that charities devoted to the condition focus on the wrong thing. There\u2019s a huge emphasis on preventing or even \u201dcuring\u201d autism, even though we\u2019re nowhere near being able to do either, and many autistic people resent the idea that their psychological differences are in need of \u201dcuring.\u201d And a new report finds that this problem isn\u2019t going away.

        "Nearly one hundred years after the first woman was elected to Congress, three states have never had either a woman senator or representative: Vermont, Delaware, and Mississippi have never elected congresswomen. As you can see above, Vermont, Delaware, and Mississippi have never been represented by a woman. Now, let\u2019s break it down by legislative body.

        "On Wednesday it was announced that Harriet Tubman, American hero and abolitionist, would be replacing Andrew Jackson on the front of the $20 bill. It\u2019s a historic (perhaps controversial) decision, that will go into effect in 2030. But as Stephen Colbert pointed out on last night\u2019s episode of The Late Show, it\u2019s also a sign of how little progress has been made. \u201dApparently, in the \u2019what to put on our money priority list,\u2019 woman and African American both came after Cyclops pyramid,\u201d he joked.

        "Tired of bad drivers on the road? Maybe you should blame bad government. That idea comes from an interesting new theory put out by James O\u2019Malley at the blog CityMetric.
