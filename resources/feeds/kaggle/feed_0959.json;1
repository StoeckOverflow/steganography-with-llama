        "What is the most important policy tool for fighting climate change? Ask just about any economist and the answer will be the same: a price on carbon emissions. Not only is there a robust consensus among economists, but they have been remarkably successful in spreading the gospel to the wider world as well. Climate activists, wonks, funders, politicians, progressives, and even conservatives (the few who take climate seriously) all sing from the same hymnal. It has become conventional wisdom that a price on carbon is the sine qua non of serious climate policy.",
        "To many people, blackness looks like one thing. For Prince Rogers Nelson, who died last year at 57, blackness could take any form. Prince rocked eyeliner. He wore sequins and rings and spandex in the wildest colors imaginable. He strutted like a peacock on the stage and in music videos. He oozed sexuality from posters on the bedroom walls of teenagers across the country. He was also openly kooky and didn\u2019t care that you made fun of him.",

        "Prince is dead at 57. As the internet mourns, a tweet calling out Prince\u2019s incredible guitar talents, referencing a supposed Eric Clapton quote, has gone viral: When asked what it feels like to be the best guitarist alive, Eric Clapton said, \u201dI don\u2019t know.

        "Prickly, judgmental Jane Eyre, the protagonist of the Charlotte Bront\u00eb novel of the same name, is not, perhaps, the most intrinsically lovable heroine of all time, or even of the 19th century.

When presented with a piteous, neglected child, Jane might allow that she\u2019s rather fond of the poor thing, but she\u2019ll also make a point of noting that the child is not particularly bright.",

In the past the brothers have thrown hundreds of millions of dollars in the race for the White House through their extensive network of conservative anonymous donors and businesses.
