        "Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin (R) vetoed a bill on Friday that would have made it a felony for doctors to provide abortions, unless a woman\u2019s life is in danger or she has had a miscarriage that needs to be removed. There were no exceptions for rape, incest, or the woman\u2019s health. Related What Donald Trump, and most Republicans, don\u2019t understand about abortion \u201dexceptions\u201d \u201dThe bill is so ambiguous and so vague that doctors cannot be certain what medical circumstances would be considered \u2019necessary to preserve the life of the mother,\u2019\u201d Fallin said in a statement.",
        "When Paul Ryan effectively took himself out of consideration as a possible Stop Trump candidate at a contested GOP convention, the smart thinking in town immediately leapt to the idea that Ryan\u2019s real sights are on the 2020 race. In a whole bunch of ways, \u201dbide your time\u201d makes sense as a strategy for almost any plausible contender.",
        "Cheery morning television shows like Today, Good Morning America, and Live! with Kelly and Michael are a strange exercise in humans doing superhuman things. The people who host them build their days around waking up before the sun, making sure their hair and teeth look shiny and perfect, and putting on a smiling face \u2014 the kind reserved for cocktail parties \u2014 to spend several hours feigning interest in everything from cooking salmon to the latest exercise trends to fall fashion to the news of the day.",
        "Welcome to Dear Julia, a column where readers submit everyday health questions. Which painkillers work best? Will intermittent fasting help you lose weight? Julia Belluz sifts through the research and consults experts in the field to figure out how science can help us live happier and healthier lives. Dear Julia: Can hand dryers in bathrooms make people sick? There\u2019s no doubt public bathrooms can be scary places, and there\u2019s no shortage of studies that seem to stoke our worst toilet fears.",
        "Apple\u2019s second quarter earnings report showed a company that is still enormous and still enormously profitable, but whose sales and profits are declining across the board \u2014 revenue fell 10 percent in the Americas, 5 percent in Europe, 26 percent in China, and 25 percent in the rest of Asia, way too much to be offset by a 24 percent increase in Japan. What\u2019s particularly striking about this, as Benjamin Mayo of 9to5Mac noted, is that Apple simply hasn\u2019t had a down quarter in so long that proclaiming each quarter to be a \u201drecord\u201d has become a dull routine.",
        "You may have heard Mississippi\u2019s religious freedom law will now allow businesses to discriminate against LGBTQ people. This is, after all, what report after report in the media have suggested. But what if I told you Mississippi\u2019s law doesn\u2019t actually allow anything new? Now, the new law does technically allow discrimination against LGBTQ people: It lets bakery owners, for instance, cite religious beliefs to deny services to couples seeking to buy a wedding cake.",
        "Public health researchers cheered an encouraging trend recently: Childhood obesity rates, which rose steadily through the 1980s and 1990s, seemed to have plateaued in the 2000s. But new research suggests a different, troubling problem lurking behind that plateau \u2014 a steep rise in the rates of severe obesity, particularly among older and minority children. The fraction of adolescents with severe obesity \u2014 a body mass index of 40 or greater \u2014 has more than doubled from 0. 9 percent in 1999 to 2. 4 percent in 2013 and 2014.",
        "A consensus has formed among economists, climate wonks, and progressives that a carbon tax is the best way to address climate change. In some quarters, rhetorical support for a carbon tax is seen as a litmus test for whether policymakers are serious about climate change. In my last post, I questioned the premise that a carbon tax is always and everywhere the \u201dfirst best\u201d climate policy. In this post, I\u2019m going to do something different: I\u2019m going to accept the premise.",
        "SoulCycle is 10 years old. What started as a germ of an idea and an empty old dance studio on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side has grown bigger than anyone, including its ever imagined. It\u2019s more than just exercise. In just a decade, SoulCycle has become a fixture in popular culture and is extending its reach all over the country. The company is filing an IPO, just as it\u2019s in the middle of a national expansion.",
        "Many people saw something to celebrate when the Treasury Department announced it would replace ethnic cleanser and former President Andrew Jackson on the front of the $20 bill with abolitionist Harriet Tubman. But as Full Frontal host Samantha Bee pointed out on her show Monday, not everyone was happy. \u201dWhen we make such a dramatic change to something no one ever looks at,\u201d Bee said, \u201dwe have to consider the fragile feelings of white men who tragically appear on only seven out of seven bills currently in production.\u201d Related Andrew Jackson was a slaver, ethnic cleanser, and tyrant.",
        "During his victory press conference after sweeping five primaries Tuesday night, Donald Trump made an assertion that seemed overly confident even for him: He\u2019d do better with women than Hillary Clinton, who could be the first woman to serve as president. \u201dThe only card she has is the woman\u2019s card. She\u2019s got nothing else to offer,\u201d Trump said in a response to a question from Vox\u2019s Liz Plank. \u201dAnd frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don\u2019t think she\u2019d get 5 percent of the vote.",
        "Usually, days designated to raise awareness for a specific disease are depressing affairs. It seems like that should be doubly true today, on World Malaria Day: It\u2019s a disease so devastating that some scholars estimate it has killed half of all people ever to have existed. But this year\u2019s day is surprisingly upbeat. The theme is \u201dEnd Malaria for Good\u201d \u2014 and it\u2019s not just wishful thinking. That\u2019s a goal that could be accomplished in our lifetime. The below chart, from Oxford University researcher Max Roser and his indispensable Our World in Data site, shows why.",
        "On Saturday night, following the HBO premiere of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s second visual album, Lemonade, the world went to bed not knowing if they would ever learn the true identity of \u201dBecky with the good hair.\u201d According to a verse on Lemonade, Becky was the other woman who the love of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s life was cheating with.",
        "At this point, the 2016 primaries have offered a bounty of Super and Tuesdays. There was the big Southern spectacular on March 1, the mashup of March 8, and the bonanza on March 15. You could throw in the March 23 contest or last week\u2019s New York primary, though those were arguably less super. And Tuesday, April 26, was certainly not the most super of the bunch, but it was definitely the Trumpiest. Five states voted \u2014 Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Delaware \u2014 and all five went to Trump. All but one went to Hillary Clinton.",
        "With his campaign for the Republican nomination seemingly at death\u2019s door, Ted Cruz is trying one last time to make a comeback \u2014 by naming Carly Fiorina as his vice presidential pick.",
        "Late on Thursday, the New York Times magazine published a lengthy profile of Hillary Clinton under an illustration of her as a toy soldier and the headline \u201dHow Hillary Clinton Became a Hawk.\u201d The profile, by Mark Landler, traces her evolution on foreign policy, explores her legacy as secretary of state, and seeks to deduce a Clinton worldview. It\u2019s fascinating, deeply reported, and well worth reading. It also reiterates what is perhaps the defining piece of conventional wisdom about Hillary Clinton and foreign policy: she is a .",
        "For 20 years, developmental psychologist Elizabeth Gershoff has been chasing a question: Does spanking actually do a child any good? \u201dAs far [back] as we have written records, people have been hitting children,\u201d Gershoff tells me. Today, spanking \u2014 hitting a child on the buttocks with an open hand \u2014 is still incredibly common. A 2015 Pew survey found that 45 percent of parents in the United States have spanked. Related Most parenting advice is worthless. So here\u2019s some parenting advice.",
        "How much you pay for health care often depends on one key fact: where you live. A new study of more than 1 billion medical bills makes this fact abundantly clear. It shows huge variation in the price of basic medical procedures like ultrasounds, annual physicals, or cataract removals. Consider this: An ultrasound for pregnancy costs an average of $183 in Canton, Ohio. But drive an hour north to Cleveland, and the average price more than doubles to $522. This problem isn\u2019t unique to Ohio.",
        "Two million public sector employees in Venezuela will only have to work two days a week, getting mandatory weekends as part of the Venezuelan government\u2019s latest attempt to save power. The dry El Nino winter has caused a gargantuan electricity crisis in Venezuela: The Latin American country continues to deplete the water reserves in the country\u2019s hydroelectric dams, which are responsible for more than 60 percent of the country\u2019s power. Aristobulo Isturiz announced civil servants only need to come in on Mondays and Tuesdays, unless they have \u201dfundamental and necessary tasks\u201d on Wednesday.",
        "Transgender Hawaiians may soon have to deal with one less form of discrimination in health care. On Tuesday, the legislature passed a bill that prohibits insurers from denying, canceling, or limiting people\u2019s coverage based on their gender identity. The bill now just needs Gov. David Ige\u2019s signature to become law. Why is the bill important? The Associated Press reported: People in Hawaii have been denied coverage for essential medical checks like mammograms or screenings for prostate cancer because of the gender on their driver\u2019s license, said Kaleo Ramos, a transgender teacher.",
        "It is satisfying and certainly trendy to complain about America\u2019s allies. President Barack Obama unloaded on them recently in an interview with the Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg, calling them \u201dfree riders\u201d who rely on the US for security but refuse to pay back. The commentariat has piled on, with a special focus on deteriorating relations with such perennial malcontents as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Turkey. The truth is that our allies behave the way they do because we let them.",
        "The Senate on Wednesday voted to override President Obama\u2019s veto of a controversial bill, known as the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) that would allow the families of victims to sue the government of Saudi Arabia for its alleged financial support of . And then things got weird.",
        "I stopped reading stories about the excess of Silicon Valley when I realized that even the most cartoonishly vile characters of the genre are just rich, boring assholes. A millionaire who finds San Francisco\u2019s Market Street \u201dgrotesque.\u201d A company that fires employees via iOS notification. A young CEO who looks around San Francisco, a city he \u201dloves,\u201d and calls for the mayor to help him protect his lovely parents from the traumatizing sight of a homeless man. I\u2019ve heard more deplorable things in a dive bar, and more creative things, too.",
        "Last week, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe reinstated the right to vote to more than 200, 000 former felons. The move inspired a lot of at Fox News and within conservative circles, with Ted Cruz arguing that \u201dit doesn\u2019t make sense\u201d to let more murderers, rapists, and violent criminals vote. Appearing on The Daily Show, comedians Key and Jordan Peele mocked some of these criticisms, while in character as two . \u201dYou can\u2019t trust convicts with electoral shit,\u201d Peele\u2019s Killa B.

        "Vox\u2019s Dylan Matthews had questions about Politico Jim VandeHei\u2019s proposal for a new Innovation Party. VandeHei had answers. In bold are Matthews\u2019s original questions, followed by VandeHei\u2019s emailed answers. Dylan Matthews: VandeHei suggests Mark Zuckerberg as a potential leader of the Innovation Party. Is VandeHei aware that Zuckerberg is 31 years old and thus constitutionally ineligible to run for president this year? Jim VandeHei: I never proposed Mark Zuckerberg for president. I tossed out the idea of Zuckerberg (or Sheryl Sandberg) as examples of people who could head a party or a movement.",
        "Bernie Sanders is right: Closed primaries, which exclude independent voters, are hurting him at the voting booth, according to a new analysis. But just how much better would Bernie be doing if every state primary let independents vote? Luckily, Emory political scientist Alan Abramowitz agreed to run the numbers for us using a model he\u2019s built for Larry Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball. Controlling for other variables, Abramowitz found that closed primaries did penalize Sanders \u2014 by roughly 4. 7 points. (The flip side of this, naturally, is that Hillary Clinton does about 4.",
        "Things are looking up for Mark Zuckerberg. While a lot of other major tech companies \u2014 including Apple, Google, and Microsoft \u2014 have posted disappointing financial results for the first quarter of 2016, Facebook announced yet another quarter of spectacular growth on Wednesday. The company\u2019s quarterly revenues have grown by more than 50 percent over the last year \u2014 an impressive achievement for a company of Facebook\u2019s size. To some extent, Zuckerberg is simply riding a wave of popularity that started when he created the social network 12 years ago.",
        "Speaking at Stanford University, former House Speaker John Boehner went the full Bulworth. \u201dYou can call me boner, beaner, jackass, happy to answer to almost anything,\u201d he said. Mostly, though, the was directed outward. Boehner called Ted Cruz \u201dLucifer in the flesh,\u201d and said, \u201dI have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life.\u201d He admitted he would vote for Donald Trump, if it came to it, but not for Cruz.",
        "In a clip from Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s new visual album Lemonade, the singer strides down a street in a yellow, ruffled dress. Elegant as always, she lights up the screen with her megawatt smile. And then she pulls out a bat and starts smashing storefront windows and car windshields. It\u2019s nothing Michael Jackson didn\u2019t do 20 years ago in his \u201dBlack or White\u201d video, but Beyonc\u00e9 makes it classy, luring you in with her grace. That\u2019s just one face of an album that proves to be an emotional tour de force.",
        "It seems nothing will revive the debate over abortion quite like an election year. In 2012, former Missouri Rep. Todd Akin\u2019s claims of \u201dlegitimate rape\u201d prompted women to have to to explain how pregnancy works. This election, Carly Fiorina blasted fetus execution videos that don\u2019t exist, Chris Christie called abortion murder, and providers had to dispel rumors that they all roll up to work in Lamborghinis."
