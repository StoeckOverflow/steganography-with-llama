        "Something weird is happening in American politics. The Republican Party seems poised to nominate Donald Trump as its presidential candidate, and he seems likely to lose in an epic landslide. That, in turn, ought to set Democrats up to win a bevy of congressional races and maybe even put the majority in the House of Representatives on the table. But here\u2019s the funny thing: Nobody in the House Democratic Caucus will say it\u2019s going to happen.",

        "Several universities across the the country have been battling outbreaks of mumps this year. The latest collegiate epicenter is Harvard, where more than 40 students have fallen ill. But unlike the worrying recent outbreaks of measles, these students aren\u2019t getting sick because they didn\u2019t get vaccinated. In fact, all of the Harvard cases had all been immunized against the virus, according to the Boston Globe. So what\u2019s going on here?

        "America is already known for leading the developed world in gun violence. But a new study finds the problem may be even worse than we think. The study, from economists Jillian Carr and Jennifer Doleac, looked at new ShotSpotter data, which uses audio sensors to report gunshots, in Oakland, California, and Washington, DC. It found that only 12 percent of gunfire incidents resulted in a 911 call to report gunshots, and only 2 to 7 percent of incidents resulted in a reported assault with a dangerous weapon. In other words, shootings are tremendously underreported in the US.",
        "A Republican congress member from California tried to make a point about women in the military, and it backfired. Amid the debate about the Pentagon announcing it would allow qualified women in combat roles, Rep. Duncan Hunter ( ) proposed to amend a defense bill to also require to women to register for Selective Service, more commonly known as the draft. \u201dRight now draft is sexist,\u201d Hunter said, proposing the amendment to the defense authorization bill to point out that if people didn\u2019t want women to be drafted, they shouldn\u2019t be in combat roles.",

I\u2019d always wondered how the term \u201dfracking,\u201d which has dominated energy discussions for years, worked its way into our vocabulary. And the backstory turns out to be pretty interesting.

        "Is Donald Trump really going to be the Republican presidential nominee? After his victories this week, this outcome looks more likely than ever, and Republican elites are increasingly resigning themselves to it. But he hasn\u2019t clinched it yet. Trump has built up such a lead in the delegate count at this point that he\u2019s all but assured to finish with more delegates than any of his rivals.",
        "As mosquito season in the United States approaches, we\u2019ve been hearing stories of pregnant women anxiously emailing each other about how to their lives.

        "Donald Trump is known for saying a lot of bizarre, offensive things on the campaign trail. But The Daily Show finally figured out a good use for those lines: a rap video. \u201dEverything Trump says is straight out of a rapper\u2019s playbook,\u201d correspondent Roy Wood Jr. said on Thursday. \u201dHe brags about his money. He\u2019s disrespectful to women.

        "As he gets closer to the Republican nomination, Donald Trump is attracting raucous protests again. In Orange County, California, last night, 17 demonstrators were arrested after the protests, which attracted hundreds of people. Protestors stopped traffic, broke the window of at least one police car, and threw rocks at cars on the freeway, the Los Angeles Times reported. One Trump supporter ended up with a bloody face.

But you probably won\u2019t want to tune in until around 9:45 pm, when comedian Larry Wilmore will deliver a standup act before Obama takes the stage. \u201dI like Obama a lot,\u201d Wilmore, host of Comedy Central\u2019s The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, told CBS.",

        "Amtrak turns 45 today, leaving many people wondering how is it that a rich and powerful country that was a pioneer in railroad adoption in the 19th century has such terrible passenger trains today. The United States is a big country, with lots of trains in it. So you can really think of this big generic question as composed of three separate questions with separate answers.",
        "The White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner has become a strange event. It is, ostensibly, an evening when the president and the press can come together to share a few lighthearted laughs. But it\u2019s evolved into a recital of brutal truths \u2014 albeit one neither side ever really admits happened. The joke of President Barack Obama\u2019s performance on Saturday was that he wasn\u2019t joking. Everyone just had to pretend he was. This was true from the beginning of his remarks, when he walked to the podium to Anna Kendrick\u2019s cover of \u201dCups\u201d (chorus: \u201dyou\u2019re gonna miss me when I\u2019m gone\u201d).",
        "Every single day, two NASA satellites named Aqua and Terra the Earth, snapping thousands of photos of our planet. Quite often, clouds obscure their view. It can be a little annoying. But recently, two scientists realized that those clouds themselves can actually reveal a surprising amount about life on Earth below. While working together at Yale, researchers Adam Wilson and Walter Jetz stitched together 15 years\u2019 worth of satellite images into a massively detailed cloud database. This allowed them to create maps showing seasonal fluctuations in cloud cover around the world.",

        "Philadelphia\u2019s mayor recently proposed a tax on every ounce of sugary drinks (sodas, iced teas, and sports drinks are the major categories).

        "Out of President Barack Obama\u2019s roughly set at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner Saturday night, one joke stands out as unusually revealing of how the president thinks about politics. \u201dBernie\u2019s slogan has helped his campaign catch fire among young people,\u201d Obama noted. \u201d\u2019Feel the Bern.\u2019 That\u2019s a good slogan.

        "Dartmouth political scientist Brendan Nyhan put together a chart that dramatizes the extent to which a Donald Trump nomination looks like an unforced error for the GOP. Hillary Clinton is intensely disliked by a larger share of Americans than anyone who\u2019s ever received a major party presidential nomination in the past. But Trump is even more widely disliked, and since elections are zero sum, this means a huge advantage for a candidate who seems kind of weak by historical standards."
