        "On Monday, Puerto Rico is expected to skip payment on $389 million in debt owed by the island\u2019s Government Development Bank to bondholders. Gov. Garcia Padilla of Puerto Rico has been warning for over a year that this government will be unable to fully pay what it owes, and has asked Congress to provide for a structured path to bankruptcy. He didn\u2019t get it, largely due to opposition from congressional Republicans, so he is now being forced to resort to unilateral repudiation of debt.",
        "The Biggest Loser, a reality TV show in which contestants compete to shed the most weight, has been a huge win for NBC \u2014 now airing all over the world in its 17th season. It\u2019s also been a boon for obesity researchers, offering them an extremely rare opportunity to study the effects of intensive diet and exercise on a group of people trying to lose over 100 pounds on average.",
        "One reason our tax system sucks is that it tends to punish exactly the kind of behavior we should be trying to reward. Income taxes discourage workers from earning money. Investment taxes discourage innovation and savings. Property taxes discourage homeowners from building cool stuff. But there\u2019s at least one great idea that doesn\u2019t appear to have any of these problems: the land value tax. With a land value tax, the government would instead be raising money based on the size of land.",
        "Bernie Sanders wants to transform how the Democratic Party chooses its presidential nominee. To do so, Sanders has made abolishing the closed primary \u2014 which prevents independents from voting \u2014 one of his top demands of Democratic officials, arguing that the party needs to \u201dopen the doors to working people, to senior citizens, to young people.\u201d Expanding voter participation is indeed a noble goal. But if Sanders really wants the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential primaries to be more representative of the public, he should forget the closed primary and go after a much better target: the caucus.",
        "The utter failure of Paul Ryan and Donald Trump to pass a bill rolling back the Affordable Care Act makes one thing perfectly clear: love him or hate him, Barack Obama is one of the most consequential presidents in American history \u2014 and that he will be a particularly towering figure in the history of American progressivism. He signed into law a comprehensive national health insurance bill, a goal that had eluded progressive presidents for a century \u2014 and built it strong enough to withstand assaults from the Supreme Court and avoid repeal from a Republican administration.",
        "For many women, serving in the military doesn\u2019t just mean serving their country. The irregular schedules and deployments can be a significant challenge to using birth control. This is a problem when military health clinics only stock certain contraceptives, or tell women service members (wrongly) that they\u2019re not eligible for a contraceptive like an IUD if they haven\u2019t had children yet. Now, a nonprofit pharmaceutical company wants to change all that \u2014 and is offering the military a unique financial deal if its clinics get on board.",
        "Last week, Michael Grunwald came out with a piece in Politico full of interesting reporting that purports to explain \u201dthe inside story of how a great communicator lost the narrative.\u201d The idea that Barack Obama has suffered from some kind of major communication failure is felt deeply inside the White House, including by the president himself.",
        "Paul Butler has a proposal for jurors who are fed up with racial disparities in the criminal justice system: Don\u2019t always follow the letter of the law. Butler, a Georgetown Law professor, doesn\u2019t mean that jurors should do anything illegal. Instead, he wants jurors to tap into \u201djury nullification.\u201d \u201dJury nullification is the power that jurors have to find a defendant not guilty even if they think that he committed the crime,\u201d Butler told me.",
        "Bill Cosby. Roger Ailes. And now, Donald Trump. All three men are prominent media figures who have allegedly been getting away with sexual harassment or sexual assault for decades. And it took until 2016 for any of them to face serious consequences for their alleged actions: Cosby was charged with sexual assault, Ailes was forced to resign as the CEO of Fox News, and Trump\u2019s presidential campaign imploded as women started coming forward to accuse him of groping or kissing them without their consent.",

        "Bernie Sanders vowed to continue the Democratic primary past the last primary race in June, forecasting a much longer battle with Hillary Clinton than her allies had hoped. \u201d[Clinton] will need superdelegates to take her over the top at the convention in Philadelphia,\u201d Sanders said at the National Press Club in Washington, DC, on Sunday. \u201dIn other words, it will be a contested convention.\u201d Down by huge margins among the delegates chosen by voters, Sanders had already opened the door for the party\u2019s unelected superdelegates to throw him the nomination.",
        "The Indiana primary holds a special place in the hearts of presidential primary obsessives. In 1968, after Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, Robert F. Kennedy famously delivered a speech in Indianapolis, where he was campaigning, calling for nonviolence and reconciliation. Kennedy won the state by double digits a month later. That\u2019s \u2026 nothing like the 2016 primary. This time there was less lofty speechifying about the future of racial justice in America and a lot more talking about Donald Trump\u2019s experience with venereal disease.",
        "Hillary Clinton seems to have regained her dominance over Bernie Sanders after a long and contentious primary battle. And she has the polls to show it. Back in something big appeared to be happening in the Democratic race: Even as Clinton was amassing an insurmountable delegate lead in the state contests, Sanders was pulling neck and neck with her in polling among Democratic voters. But Clinton has since trended back upward. Several new national polls have since found her pulling ahead of Sanders, erasing earlier signs that Sanders was becoming the more popular figure among Democrats.",
        "When Jane Jacobs published The Death and Life of Great American Cities in 1961, she was a lone voice with no credentials speaking up against the most powerful ideas in urban planning. years later, on Jacobs\u2019s 100th birthday (honored in today\u2019s Google Doodle) urban dwellers are all living in her vision of the great American city. The Death and Life of Great American Cities was a reaction to urban planning movements that wanted to clear entire city blocks and rebuild them, believing beautiful architecture was superior to crowded streets.",

        "Imagine if a dumb high school prank got you arrested, with the threat of 70 criminal charges that could impose a lifetime of punishment. That was the potential fate of Hunter Osborn, a high school student in Arizona. After a teammate dared Osborn to stick out the top of his penis during the yearbook football picture, Osborn did just that. As Patrick Redford reported for Deadspin, mayhem ensued.",

        "The nominations for the 70th annual Tony Awards, Broadway\u2019s highest honor, were announced Tuesday, May 3 in what may be the year ever for the annual theater honors. Fresh off winning the Pulitzer Prize for drama, Hamilton was widely expected to sweep the nominations \u2014 and it did, garnering a 16 nods across all musical categories.

        "Indiana is one of two key states remaining in the Republican primary. And after Indiana voters go to the polls today, there will only be one major night of primaries left. Polls close in Indiana at 6 pm local time \u2014 that\u2019s 6 pm Eastern for most of the state, and 7 pm Eastern in 12 counties in northwest and southwest Indiana. Indiana is a for Sen.

        "Imagine, for a moment, that America\u2019s cows decided to stage a military coup. They would certainly have a size advantage. At 1, 330 pounds, the average cow is the mass equivalent of about nine American adults. Collectively, the cantankerous varmints outweigh us by 66 billion pounds. Cows are also quiet killers. While we\u2019re busy cowering over sharks and arachnids, they maul about 20 of us to death each year. They frequently team up to carry out these murders, proving that they\u2019re in the procedures of a grassroots uprising. And there are a lot of them.",
        "Indiana is one of the last remaining battlegrounds in the race for the Republican nomination \u2014 and Hoosiers\u2019 search data, much like recent polls, suggests a decent chance that Indiana voters could hand the nomination to Trump. We asked Google to pull search data from Indiana for the week leading up to the primary. It shows that, when it comes to politics, people there are mostly searching for Trump and the issues he likes to talk about most: terrorism and immigration. Google search, obviously, is not a perfect predictor of electoral outcomes.",
        "\u201dDonald Trump is now the leader of the Republican Party. It\u2019s real.\u201d It\u2019s a sentiment that many Americans are feeling today, but it also came from a brutal Facebook post by Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday following Trump\u2019s victory in the Indiana primary and Ted Cruz\u2019s decision to drop out. In the post, Warren called out Trump for his \u201dracism, sexism, and xenophobia\u201d and went on to call on Republicans, Democrats, and independents to unite against Trump\u2019s \u201dtoxic stew of hatred and insecurity\u201d: Donald Trump is now the leader of the Republican Party.",
        "Update (May 5, 2016): In a new post on his website, Wright has now tacitly admitted that he can\u2019t prove his identity as Bitcoin\u2019s creator.

        "With Donald Trump as the presumptive Republican nominee, the stakes for the Supreme Court have become startlingly clear. The position of the Senate GOP under majority leader Mitch McConnell has always been that the next president should decide on Antonin Scalia\u2019s replacement \u2014 and that, accordingly, they will not so much as consider Barack Obama\u2019s nominee, Merrick Garland. Now that position translates to: We think Donald Trump should pick the next Supreme Court justice. That is proving to be too much for some conservatives to swallow.",
        "Rooftop solar is expanding rapidly in the United States \u2014 by some estimates, a new system goes up every four minutes. There are plenty of reasons for that, from falling prices to generous federal subsidies to innovative leasing schemes. But there\u2019s another, factor here: Residential solar power is contagious. Yep, contagious. Studies have found that if you install solar photovoltaic panels on your roof, that increases the odds that your neighbors will install their own panels. SolarCity, the largest solar installer in the United States, just published some fascinating data on this \u201dcontagion\u201d effect.",
