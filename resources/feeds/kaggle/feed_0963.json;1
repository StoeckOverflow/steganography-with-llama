        "Where were you when you realized Donald Trump would be the Republican presidential nominee? Vox Sentences is written by Dylan Matthews and Dara Lind. TOP NEWS #EverTrump Spencer Images Donald Trump is the last remaining candidate for the 2016 Republican nomination for president. This is horrifying. It is okay to be horrified. [Vox Ezra Klein] The first question is whether, and how much of, the GOP will reconcile itself to Trump. There\u2019s a case to be made that the party is facing inevitable civil war. [Mischiefs of Faction Seth Masket] But many Republicans are already coming around.",
        "Democrats hoping to bring the party together after a bitter and contentious primary between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders may have found their answer: Donald Trump. Trump has become the presumptive Republican nominee after rivals John Kasich and Ted Cruz suspended their presidential campaigns. From the perspective of Democratic Party unity, Trump\u2019s march to the nomination is great news: Sanders\u2019s supporters have made a lot of noise about going \u201dBernie or bust,\u201d but a poll out from CNN on Wednesday finds they prefer Clinton to Trump by an margin.",
        "The Food and Drug Administration is finally going to start regulating and other tobacco products such as cigars and hookah the same way it regulates cigarettes, according to a federal rule published on Thursday. Importantly, this means the agency now has jurisdiction over all tobacco products in the US \u2014 including the $3 billion industry that wasn\u2019t previously under its control.",
        "Bathrooms have become a huge political battleground in America. On Wednesday, the Trump administration took its first major policy action \u2014 by rescinding a guidance that protected transgender students from discrimination in federally funded schools and, most controversially, asked schools to let trans students use the bathrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their gender identity. It was the bathroom portion that made the guidance so controversial among conservative lawmakers, inspiring states to file lawsuits against the Obama administration and, eventually, leading the Trump administration to rescind the guidelines.",
        "After Donald Trump secured the Republican nomination on Tuesday night, the BBC rounded up the reactions from the global press to Trump\u2019s victory. Aside from some gloating in authoritarian Russia and China, the reaction was pretty shocked. \u201dThe craziest US presidential election campaign begins,\u201d Germany\u2019s Die Welt daily wrote. \u201dThe unthinkable has come to pass.\u201d You\u2019ve seen similar coverage from the foreign press throughout Trump\u2019s rise, the tone of which has been a mixture of panic, terror, and gallows humor.",
        "As we recently learned from a paper published in JAMA, an 30 percent of antibiotic prescriptions in the United States are unnecessary. As Vox\u2019s Julia Belluz reports, the majority of these prescriptions are for viral infections. Which is ridiculous: Antibiotics don\u2019t work against viruses. Period. When doctors prescribe antibiotics needlessly for things like colds, more bacteria become resistant to them. It\u2019s simple evolution. In any given population of bacteria, there may be a few with the genes to survive an antibiotic chemical assault. Those bugs then multiply. In the past, medicine has fought back by developing new antibiotics.",
        "Most of us take it for granted that we have a right to quit our current job and find a new one. But a growing number of workers are seeing this freedom curtailed by noncompete contracts that bar employees from taking jobs with a competitor of their previous employer. A new report from the White House portrays this trend as a threat to both worker rights and economic growth. Limits on worker mobility can slow the spread of knowledge and, therefore, the rate of technological progress.",
        "In our era, there\u2019s a seemingly unlimited appetite for shortcuts, hacks, and more efficient ways to do mundane activities. So it\u2019s no surprise that really, really short workouts have broad appeal. When exercise scientists tell us \u2014 as they have lately in a number of new studies \u2014 that we don\u2019t have to run for an hour, or even half an hour, to get big health benefits, of course we listen up. These studies are catnip for health journalists, too.",
        "Now that Donald Trump has secured his place as the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nominee, the fact that his statements on matters of public policy often don\u2019t make sense will be taken much more seriously. The latest example came during yesterday\u2019s interview between Trump and CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer in which, among other things, Blitzer asked Trump about Puerto Rico. You can read our explainer on the Puerto Rico situation here, but the long and short of it is that Puerto Rico owes a ton of money and, due to population loss, it can\u2019t pay.",
        "It now seems all but certain that the presidential election will see Donald Trump face off against Hillary Clinton. We find ourselves at the tail end of a brief period of clarity. For the past few months, virtually everyone outside of the 40 percent of Republican primary voters who carried him to victory has agreed that Trump is not fit to be president.",
        "The pesky Aedes aegypti mosquito has been buzzing around infecting millions of people in the Western Hemisphere with the Zika virus. Now some scientists think we should retaliate \u2014 and infect the mosquito with a strange little bug of our own. It sounds zany, but it might actually work. Scientists have long known that if they infect just a few A. aegypti mosquitoes with a type of bacterium known as Wolbachia, the microbe will rapidly spread and infect much of the population. Once that happens, the infected mosquitoes lose their ability to transmit dengue fever among humans.",
        "On Friday, many Americans are celebrating a holiday they likely know almost nothing about. I\u2019m speaking, of course, of Cinco de Mayo, which is Spanish for May 5. Although the day is supposed to celebrate Mexican heritage, it has become Americanized \u2014 that is, hijacked into another excuse to party, eat, and drink, all while getting sweet discounts at some restaurants. (It is so Americanized, in fact, that it\u2019s actually celebrated more in the US than in Mexico.) The origins of the holiday go back to, as one would expect, Mexican history.",
        "Bernie Sanders is still running for the Democratic nomination. And his campaign still has some attacks on Hillary Clinton. Early this week, after a Politico report examined the workings of Clinton\u2019s fundraising apparatus, Sanders\u2019s campaign accused Clinton of running a \u201d scheme.\u201d At issue is Clinton\u2019s \u201djoint fundraising committee\u201d \u2014 an organization set up to help Clinton raise money with the Democratic National Committee and 32 separate state Democratic parties. Clinton has said the money for the committee would also be used to help fund Democrats\u2019 state parties.",
        "One of the strangest allegations leveled against Donald Trump by his Republican critics is that he\u2019s not a conservative \u2014 or even, in the most extreme version of this critique, that he\u2019s actually a liberal. \u201dPeople can support Donald Trump, but they cannot support him on conservative grounds,\u201d former George W. Bush aide Peter Wehner writes at Commentary. \u201dThe case for constitutional limited government is the case against Donald Trump,\u201d declares Federalist founder Ben Domenech.",
        "How does an internet troll build his own following? That\u2019s a question that Ken McCarthy, a. k. a. Ken M, can answer: He\u2019s the subject of a dedicated subreddit with more than 150, 000 fans, as well as popular Facebook and Twitter pages. And that following is all for . .. leaving comments. As the above video shows, those comments are funny enough to create a legion of devoted fans.",
        "By any standard, the Solar Impulse 2 is a marvel of engineering. This plane \u2014 currently being flown around the world by Bertrand Piccard and Andr\u00e9 Borschberg \u2014 didn\u2019t use a drop of kerosene on its epic trip across the Pacific Ocean. It\u2019s a real testament to how far solar technology has advanced. Unfortunately, for anyone hoping that we\u2019ll all be puttering around in solar planes soon \u2014 well, that\u2019s pretty unlikely. Consider: The Solar Impulse 2 features 17, 000 solar cells crammed onto its jumbo jet \u2014 size wings, along with four batteries to store electricity for nighttime.",
        "There\u2019s a creeping anxiety in the halls of some American progressive groups \u2014 especially those aligned with labor unions and economic populism \u2014 that Donald Trump might be almost too weak a nominee, from their point of view. The worry is that he\u2019s so vulnerable that he\u2019ll tempt Hillary Clinton to run a campaign that is as anodyne as possible on policy, focused almost exclusively on Trump\u2019s personality and lack of qualifications, aiming for a landslide win that would carry no mandate.",
        "One of the biggest questions surrounding marijuana legalization is whether it will make the drug much more affordable and accessible \u2014 and therefore increase use. Well, some early data is coming out of Washington state, which legalized marijuana in 2012 and began sales in 2014. And it looks like, as drug policy experts long suggested, marijuana\u2019s price drops after legalization. Keith Humphreys of Stanford University explained in the Washington Post: Marijuana price data from Washington\u2019s Liquor and Cannabis Board was aggregated by Steve Davenport of the Pardee RAND Graduate School and Jonathan Caulkins, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University.",
        "Usually it takes a scandal or a massive policy blunder to force a sitting head of government to resign. But Thursday morning, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu announced that he\u2019d be leaving his job on May 22 \u2014 without a scandal or policy blunder in sight. Instead, Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, forced Davuto\u011flu from his job. On paper, this is strange: Turkey has a parliamentary democracy, so the prime minister, not the president, is supposed to actually run the government.",
        "Mercury, one of our closest planetary neighbors, has largely been a mystery ever since it was first glimpsed in the sky thousands of years ago. But scientists are finally uncovering some of its secrets \u2014 all thanks to a tiny NASA probe that died a grisly death last spring.",
        "In an interview Thursday on CNBC, Donald Trump broke with tired clich\u00e9s about the evils of federal debt accumulation. \u201dI am the king of debt,\u201d he said. \u201dI love debt. I love playing with it.\u201d But he replaced fearmongering about debt with an even more alarming notion \u2014 a bankruptcy of the United States federal government that would incinerate the world economy. \u201dI would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal,\u201d Trump said. \u201dAnd if the economy was good, it was good.",
        "Bernie Sanders\u2019s campaign has seized on a new narrative: The superdelegates will decide the Democratic primary. \u201dWhoever becomes the nominee, their nomination will depend on getting enough superdelegates,\u201d Sanders\u2019s aide Jeff Weaver said on Wednesday. \u201dAnd these are people who are not elected through that process. These are elected officials and Democratic members of Congress and governors and party leaders.\u201d This narrative has gained currency among some Sanders supporters, who have recently published columns in Salon and other blogs saying that the undemocratically chosen elite superdelegates might unfairly cost him the nomination. The have also happened on Twitter.",
        "Now that Donald Trump is the Republican leading GOP elites from Reince Priebus to Mitch McConnell have been flocking to endorse him. But House Speaker Paul Ryan broke sharply with the trend during on Thursday, telling CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that he was not yet \u201dready\u201d to endorse Trump. \u201dTo be perfectly candid with you Jake, I\u2019m just not ready to do that at this point. I\u2019m not there right now,\u201d Ryan said. \u201dI hope to though. And I want to.",

        "Mother\u2019s Day is this Sunday \u2014 have you picked out a present yet? If you\u2019re panicking, you\u2019d do worse than to make a donation in your mom\u2019s honor to a place that deserves it. But it can be intimidating to know how to pick the best charity, especially when there are thousands of worthy causes to choose from. Here are a few simple tips that can help. 1) Check in with charity recommenders It\u2019s of course possible to research charity options yourself, but it\u2019s probably better to outsource that labor to a careful, methodologically rigorous charity recommender like GiveWell.",
        "Even with Captain America: Civil War taking movie theaters by storm, Marvel is keeping its eye on the future. It currently has movies scheduled through 2020, including but not limited to this fall\u2019s Doctor Strange, Black Panther (February 2018) and sequels for Thor, and the Guardians of the Galaxy. Related Captain America: Civil War will make you remember why we love superheroes And that\u2019s all in addition to Marvel\u2019s first standalone movie (July 2017, produced in conjunction with Sony) and the Avengers: Infinity War that\u2019s slated for 2018 and 2019.",
        "To say scientists are unhappy about the New Yorker\u2019s recent feature on epigenetic research might be an understatement. Here are some complaints, assembled by the biologist Jerry Coyne on his blog: \u201dThe New Yorker article is so wildly wrong that it defies rational analysis,\u201d writes Walter Gilbert, a biochemist who has won the Nobel prize. \u201dIt is unfortunate to inflict this article, without proper scientific review, on the audience of The New Yorker,\u201d writes Sidney Altman, another Nobel Laureate. Mukherjee didn\u2019t make it clear that other, prominent, scientists would choose to tell this story in a different way.",

        "A simple epitaph for CBS legal drama The Good Wife, which ends its run Sunday, May 8, might say that it aired five seasons and then two deeply troubled ones. Of course, it\u2019s not that simple. It never is. The first half of the show\u2019s fourth season is filled with clunkers, and there have been brilliant episodes scattered throughout the final two years. But the conventional wisdom is more or less right.",
        "Stargazers, take note! On Monday, May 9, the planet Mercury will wander directly in front of the sun \u2014 a rare \u201dtransit\u201d that only happens about 13 times a century. Mercury begins its transit at 7:12 am EST and will take about 7. 5 hours to fully cross the sun\u2019s face, finishing at 2:42 pm. The graphic from NASA above shows its expected path. Most people in Europe and North America should be able to view the event directly through a telescope or binoculars, weather permitting. Just make sure you use a solar filter before watching the transit."
