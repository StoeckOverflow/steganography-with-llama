        "It\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day, a time for cards, brunches, gifts, and appreciation. But as Vox\u2019s Ezra Klein notes, America actually has a funny way of showing its appreciation for mothers through its public policy. We\u2019re the only developed nation in the world that doesn\u2019t have some kind of guaranteed paid maternity or sick leave. Child care is obscenely expensive and not guaranteed, and mothers face a 5 percent wage penalty for every child they have. But as it turns out, that disregard for mothers at the policy level starts early \u2014 when women first get pregnant.",
        "A few years after Anna Jarvis founded Mother\u2019s Day in 1908, she grew to despise her creation. In the video above, Adam Conover of TruTV\u2019s Adam Ruins Everything goes through why the founder of Mother\u2019s Day didn\u2019t like the holiday she helped create. \u201dAnna Jarvis created Mother\u2019s Day to honor her own mom,\u201d Conover explained. \u201dAnd she was horrified when greeting card companies adopted it, and started using the holiday to guilt people into spending money.",
        "A lot of horror is about motherhood, in one sense or another. Think of Rosemary\u2019s Baby or The Exorcist, both movies about the fear that your child might be some otherworldly thing that even its mother struggles to love. Or think about how the monster in Alien may as well be a malevolent fetus, looking for any exit it can find. This makes sense.",
        "When the United Kingdom\u2019s Natural Environment Research Council asked the people of the internet to name its newest research ship, the group floated ideas like RRS Falcon or RRS Endeavor. The internet returned with RRS Boaty McBoatface. But alas, the RRS Boaty McBoatface is no more, the NERC announced Friday, deciding to name the research vessel after famed British TV presenter and naturalist Sir David Attenborough, who turned 90 on Sunday.",
        "Over the weekend, Patrick Healy and Jonathan Martin in the New York Times published a account of how Donald Trump managed to execute \u201da hostile takeover of one of America\u2019s two major political parties.\u201d Remarkably, the idea of racism never appears in the article. Race is alluded to at one point in the article, but it\u2019s kind of backdoor and offered essentially as a form of false consciousness argument attributed to Robert Putnam.",
        "When burst onto the market about a decade ago, manufacturers enjoyed a long period of no regulation. The market boomed, and so did use among Americans. Now that may change. Last week, the Food and Drug Administration finally was granted authority over the market (as well as other previously unregulated tobacco products such as cigars and hookah) under a new federal rule.",
        "Last month, Uber announced that it was settling two big driver lawsuits that could have forced the company to recognize its drivers as employees rather than independent contractors. In a post titled \u201dGrowing and growing up,\u201d Uber CEO Travis Kalanick argued that it was \u201dtime to change\u201d Uber\u2019s relationship with drivers, offering drivers more transparency and due process. Uber should make these the first steps toward a broader rethinking of the company\u2019s public image and the way it does business.",
        "North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory and the federal government are suing each other in a growing battle over the state\u2019s law. The expanding battle follows the Obama administration\u2019s demands that the state stop enforcing the law, which prohibits transgender people from using the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity in schools and government buildings.",
        "On Monday afternoon, at 4 pm Eastern, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter will host an awards ceremony at the Pentagon honoring one of the world\u2019s most notorious war criminals. The criminal in question, Dr. Henry Kissinger, has never been charged. But the evidence that he aided and abetted war crimes during his time in the White House advising Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford is and overwhelming. While Kissinger deserves real credit for some of America\u2019s most important Cold War victories, including Nixon\u2019s diplomatic opening to China, he is also responsible for some of its worst atrocities.",
        "Media coverage of the Democratic primary has not shed much light on Hillary Clinton\u2019s proposals for climate change and clean energy policy. But oh, she has proposals. Lots of them! I read the white papers. And I called the campaign to talk through some of the specifics and the broader political thinking that informs them. Her plans haven\u2019t gotten much press \u2014 not as much as, say, her gaffe about coal miners \u2014 but they are exhaustive.",
        "Maybe, watching election results come in, you\u2019re beginning to think about that joke you made months ago. Maybe you really should move to Canada. In 2016, you\u2019re not alone: The Canadian government\u2019s immigration website crashed the day after Donald Trump swept the Super Tuesday primaries, under the force of thousands of Americans Google searching \u201dmove to Canada.\u201d But moving to Canada is harder than it seems. I am here to explain it to you. To a certain extent, we\u2019ve been here before.",
        "In 2014, a slew of headlines seemed to confirm what many had long suspected \u2014 that the rich were actually the ones in control and the rest of us chumps were just along for the ride: \u201dStudy: US is an oligarchy, not a democracy\u201d; \u201dPrinceton Study: US No Longer An Actual Democracy\u201d; \u201dStudy: You Have \u2019 \u2019 Impact on US Policy\u201d; \u201dStudy: Politicians listen to rich people, not you\u201d; \u201dRich people rule!\u201d All of these stories were about a study by political scientists Martin Gilens of Princeton and Benjamin Page of Northwestern, modestly titled, \u201dTesting Theories of American Politics: Elites,",
        "Something remarkable is happening in Ethiopia: Although the country is in the middle of yet another brutal drought, it\u2019s no longer leading to deaths from starvation. That\u2019s notable given Ethiopia\u2019s history: A drought and subsequent famine in the 1980s, exacerbated by a civil war, killed at least 600, 000 people. What\u2019s changed, argues Alex de Waal, executive director of the World Peace Foundation, isn\u2019t the country\u2019s resources but its politics. Ethiopia is no longer in the middle of a civil war, and the government has relief programs to fend off widespread famine.",

Vox Sentences is written by Dylan Matthews and Dara Lind. TOP NEWS Changing stalls William B. NewsWire via Getty Images Last week, the US Department of Justice told North Carolina that its \u201dbathroom law,\u201d HB2, violates the federal government\u2019s interpretation of the Civil Rights Act, and therefore that the state risked losing education funding.

        "Donald Trump\u2019s rise in the Republican Party seemed like the perfect fodder for former Daily Show host Jon Stewart. But Stewart, who retired last year from the show, has for the most part remained silent about the billionaire\u2019s rise in presidential politics. Until now. \u201dI\u2019m not a constitutional scholar, so I can\u2019t necessarily say, but are you eligible to run if you are a or a ?

        "As Donald Trump is being pressed more on issues like taxes and trade, it\u2019s not so clear where he stands on the issue of equal pay. Though at the beginning of his campaign he proclaimed women and men should be paid the same, a response he gave to a woman at a recent town hall seemed to indicate otherwise. \u201dYou\u2019re gonna make the same if you do as good a job,\u201d he said, suggesting he believes gender pay disparities are due to women\u2019s behavior. His argument isn\u2019t that novel.",
        "Here\u2019s the past 24 hours of politics in Brazil: Brazil\u2019s equivalent of the speaker of the house, Waldir Maranh\u00e3o, basically calls backsies on an impeachment vote his predecessor in the house held against President Dilma Rousseff. I mean that literally: He said the vote to impeach Rousseff was \u201dannulled.\u201d The leader of the senate, Renan Calheiros, then rejects Maranh\u00e3o\u2019s annulment, and says he\u2019s going ahead with a senate vote on Rousseff\u2019s impeachment anyway. Maranh\u00e3o\u2019s party threatens to kick him out, as they support Rousseff\u2019s impeachment.",
        "One of the primary delegates Donald Trump\u2019s listed on official paperwork in California is an actual, outspoken, white nationalist, Mother Jones\u2019s Josh Harkinson reports. William Johnson, the leader of the white supremacist American Freedom Party, is on a list of 169 delegates the Trump campaign has sent to the California secretary of state.",
        "The hamburger isn\u2019t exactly the poster child for food safety. In recent years, we\u2019ve seen ground beef implicated in scandals involving strains of E. coli that can sicken or kill, as well as salmonella, listeria, and other harmful bugs. But while a new report from the food analytics startup Clear Labs has some startling findings about the hamburgers on the market, it should ultimately provide reassuring for consumers. Using DNA sequencing, the researchers analyzed 258 burger products \u2014 including frozen patties, fast food burgers, and veggie burgers \u2014 from a representative sample of retailers and chains in Northern California.",
        "This is one of the clearest visualizations of global warming I\u2019ve ever seen. Ed Hawkins, a climate scientist at the University of Reading, recently made this mesmerizing (and ) GIF showing world temperatures spiraling upward over time between 1850 and 2016: Each point on the spiral shows how a given month\u2019s average temperature deviates from the average between 1850 and 1900 (the period before industrial activity really took off in the 20th century). Global warming isn\u2019t a smooth process, and there are fluctuations from year to year due to internal variability (e. g.",
        "When Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump pays a spontaneous visit to Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto on Wednesday, they\u2019re going to have a hard time avoiding the elephant in the room: Trump\u2019s famous proposal to \u201dbuild a wall and make Mexico pay for it.\u201d Perhaps, though, Pe\u00f1a Nieto might come to the meeting armed with a counterproposal: one that Mexican Twitter users have been suggesting for ages.

        "Most of us have absolutely no clue how we will die. But there\u2019s enough data out there to give us a good sense of the diseases or accidents most likely to befall us. Using mortality information from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2005 to 2014, Nathan Yau at Flowing Data made an interactive to map out death trends for men and women from the age of 0 to 100. The chart shows percentages \u2014 not absolute counts \u2014 for the 20 categories of disease deaths the CDC tracks, as well as deaths from external causes.",
        "Bernie Sanders proposes raising taxes on virtually every American, no matter how little money they make. But he has long argued that Americans will get more back in benefits than they pay out in additional taxes \u2014 and a new Tax Policy Center analysis suggests that\u2019s right. It finds that the average household in even the 95th percentile of American households would save money under a President Sanders because of the new government benefits they receive. The average household would see a tax increase of about $9, 000 under Sanders\u2019s plan, which is daunting.",
        "Over the past five years, some states have become quite creative about passing laws that seem specifically designed to close abortion clinics. requirements about building codes or medical licensing have proven so impossible for abortion providers to comply with that the Supreme Court is considering whether to overturn them. But Alabama might have just come up with the most creative idea yet: forbidding abortion clinics from operating within 2, 000 feet of a public elementary or middle school.",
        "In the span of 24 hours, Meghan Trainor released, took down, denounced, and reposted her music video for \u201dMe Too\u201d \u2014 a single off her new album, Thank You, which comes out this Friday, May 13. The singer claims that the original video purposefully shrank her waist in such an egregious way that she couldn\u2019t let it stay up, which makes sense, given that the accompanying song is all about being empowered enough to love yourself.",
        "About a week ago, David Samuels published a profile in the New York Times magazine of Ben Rhodes, a but highly influential member of President Obama\u2019s national security team, that\u2019s set Washington ablaze. Conservative media has enthusiastically embraced a handful of sensational lines as proof of Obama\u2019s duplicity, while stories in the Atlantic, Mother Jones, Politico, New York magazine, and Slate have sliced and diced it as riddled with errors.",
        "To many observers, Brazil appears one swarm of locusts short of a biblical plague. Whether it\u2019s the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff, the country\u2019s worst recession in 80 years (or maybe ever) the spread of the bizarre and frightening Zika virus, or its continued struggle with drug gangs and homicides, Brazil looks anything but ready to host the world at the Summer Olympics this August. Without a doubt, it has been a terrible 2016 \u2014 and a huge letdown after Brazil\u2019s economic boom of the 2000s, which helped it win the Olympics bid in the first place.",
        "We need to talk about Labrador retriever obesity, the world\u2019s cuddliest epidemic. According to the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention, around 54 percent of all dogs in the US are overweight or obese. But Labs top the scales. According to a survey of veterinarians, around 60 percent of Labs they see are obese. While some pet owners may argue there\u2019s just \u201dmore to love,\u201d these overweight dogs suffer health consequences. Heavy dogs have a lower life expectancy and higher risks for heart disease, bone problems, and cancer. All dogs love food.",
        "Campaigning in Virginia this week, Hillary Clinton revived an idea that was once a staple of liberal thinking about how to improve the Affordable Care Act \u2014 letting older Americans \u201dbuy in\u201d to Medicare rather than to a private insurance company. A brief history of the Medicare A version of this idea was floated way back in Bill Clinton\u2019s 1998 State of the Union address, in which he said that \u201dmillions of Americans between the ages of 55 and 65 have lost their health insurance \u2026 after a lifetime of work, they are left with nowhere to turn."
