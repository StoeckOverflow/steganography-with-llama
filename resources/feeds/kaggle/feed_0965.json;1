        "Fruits and vegetables have changed a lot since the onset of agriculture 10, 000 years ago, as generation after generation of farmers artificially bred crops to select for more desirable traits like size and taste. But that change can be hard to visualize. So James Kennedy, a chemistry teacher in Australia, created some terrific infographics to show just how drastic the evolution has been.",
        "The type of birth control a woman uses might depend on where she lives \u2014 and how old she is. The health data firm Amino scanned half a million birth control claimsfiled with insurance companies in 2014 and 2015. The researchers focused on women who received reversible contraceptives (LARC). LARCs are incredibly effective at preventing pregnancy and are becoming more popular; use has tripled in the United States since 2002. Amino found a few interesting trends in the data.",
        "Ever since the Affordable Care Act (a. k. a. Obamacare) passed on a vote more than six years ago, each negative development has been a lightning rod for declarations by critics that the law is collapsing. The divisive politics surrounding the ACA tend to create a maelstrom of spin, pro and con, with context and nuance often getting obscured. Now comes the latest news that premium increases in the ACA\u2019s health insurance marketplaces will be higher next year. (Keep in mind that health insurance premiums almost always go up, and often went up quite a bit before the ACA.",

        "Across the economy, men make more than women. Part of the push to close the wage gap is to remove barriers to women entering careers, like those in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). But even at this high level, a new study finds women in STEM careers make 31 percent less then men in their first year after graduation.

        "Most shows are supposed to start winding down around season five, or at least start coasting on charm and familiarity. But New Girl \u2014 Fox\u2019s sitcom about a group of flailing \u2014 didn\u2019t just rise to a whole new set of challenges in its fifth season.

        "Donald Trump probably won\u2019t release his tax returns before November, but the American people shouldn\u2019t worry, he says: \u201dThere\u2019s nothing to learn from them.\u201d Due to an ongoing and \u201droutine\u201d audit of his financial records, Trump, in an interview with the Associated Press, said he is unable to release his tax records at this time. \u201dNow, I hope it gets finished soon,\u201d Trump said of the audit. \u201dAnd if it gets finished soon, I put it out immediately because there\u2019s nothing there.",
        "Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate and billionaire Republican donor, has made up his mind: He\u2019s supporting Donald Trump, and other Republicans need to fall in line. Adelson\u2019s endorsement, in an in the Washington Post, matters because he\u2019s very wealthy and very willing to spend his wealth to elect Republicans. He spent as much as $150 million trying to defeat President Obama in 2012. His argument boils down to three points: Any Republican is better than a Democrat, Hillary Clinton in particular would be worse, and Trump\u2019s CEO experience has to count for something.",

        "The Obama administration wants public schools to stop discriminating against transgender students and let trans kids use the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity. But that goal hit a big obstacle on Sunday, when a federal court in Texas temporarily blocked enforcement of a guidance from the Obama administration that seeks to protect trans students in public schools. Previously, the administration sent out guidelines that told schools they cannot discriminate against transgender students or block them from using the bathroom or locker room for their gender identity.",

        "The political debate over taxes often centers on income tax \u2014 a tax that gets increasingly larger for Americans who earn more money. For example, every dollar you make under $9, 275 is taxed at 10 percent \u2014 but every dollar you make over $415, 050 is taxed at 39. 6 percent. For obvious reasons, this type of tax is less popular with Americans. But there are other federal taxes that Americans pay, too, the biggest of which are payroll taxes. Whether you earn $5, 000 or $100, 000, Americans pay up to 15.",

        "A federal judge sided with House Republicans\u2019 lawsuit against Obamacare on Thursday \u2014 a significant victory for one of the last remaining legal challenges to the President Barack Obama\u2019s health law.

        "Just hours after sending out clear guidelines against discrimination in schools, the Obama administration published another rule protecting trans people \u2014 this time in health care. The US Department of Health and Human Services finalized the regulations for Section 1557 of Obamacare, which bans sex discrimination in health services and insurance. HHS says that bans on sex discrimination protect trans people, because discrimination based on gender identity is, fundamentally, discrimination over what people of certain sexes should be like.",
