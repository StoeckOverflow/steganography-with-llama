        "During World War II, millions of Americans planted \u201dvictory gardens\u201d in their backyards, eventually supplying a hungry nation with 40 percent of its homegrown fruits and vegetables. Once the war was over, those urban farms withered away, supplanted by increasingly efficient rural agriculture. Now urban farming is staging a curious comeback. In recent years, US cities like Detroit, Washington, DC, and San Francisco have set up programs encouraging people to grow crops in vacant lots or on rooftops. Michelle Obama has promoted the resurgence of community gardens.",
        "European chefs like Ferran Adri\u00e0 and Jamie Oliver have said that when it comes to salt, there is one to rule them all. It\u2019s called Maldon. The flakes of crunchy sea salt, on England\u2019s Essex coast, cost 10 times the price of regular table salt. They taste so good, Britain\u2019s Nigel Slater says he\u2019ll use nothing else in his dishes, and Maldon has even earned a coveted nod from the British Royal Family. But are there different classes of salt for cooking?",
        "President Barack Obama reassured Howard University graduates during his commencement address last Saturday, \u201dIf you had to choose a time to be, in the words of Lorraine Hansberry, \u2018young, gifted, and black\u2019 in America, you would choose right now.\u201d But a new survey of American teens by Newsweek suggests teens today aren\u2019t as confident that racial discrimination in America is better than American teens 50 years.",
        "Top Gun \u2014 released 30 years ago, on May 16, 1986 \u2014 is a smirking fantasy of macho men, fighter jets, and the women who love them both. It\u2019s a walking, talking July Fourth barbecue brought roaring to life. It kicks ass, then swaggers off into the sunset. Everything about Top Gun\u2019s patriotism was purposeful. In fact, as Tom Shone details in his film history book Blockbuster, the idea for the movie was born when producer Jerry Bruckheimer glanced at California magazine and saw a photograph of a hotshot pilot. That was it.",
        "One way in which Amazon differs from a conventional supermarket or a place like Walmart or Target is that it offers relatively little in terms of \u201d \u201d products. There\u2019s the Amazon Basics line of electronics accessories and there are Amazon Elements baby wipes, but not much else.",
        "There are at least four states that currently have just one health insurer planning to sell on their Obamacare marketplace in 2017: Alaska, Alabama, South Carolina and Wyoming. And there is one county in Arizona \u2014 Pinal County, just outside Phoenix \u2014 that currently has no health plans signed up at all after Aetna\u2019s Monday announcement that it would quit selling in the state. The health care law doesn\u2019t really have any back up plan to fix this.",
        "Now that Donald Trump will be the GOP presidential nominee, Democrats are daring to hope that an landslide could lead to an landslide down ballot as well. And in Senate races across the country, the party appears really to take advantage of this prospect. In addition to competing in a set of Senate contests that have long been expected to be in play, Democrats have managed to recruit and potentially formidable challengers in many \u201dreach\u201d Senate races where the party wouldn\u2019t ordinarily expect a win.",
        "Despite the historic nuclear agreement between the US and Iran, and talk of the rising political influence of Iran\u2019s \u201dmoderates,\u201d who favor easing tensions with the US, the fact is that a core constituency in the Iranian regime remains vehemently opposed to warming relations with America. Related Why many of Iran\u2019s \u201dmoderates\u201d say they prefer Trump to Clinton That constituency is led by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) the security and military organization that is responsible for the protection and survival of the regime.",
        "The Supreme Court announced Monday that it will essentially punt on Zubik v. Burwell, the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s birth control mandate, by sending the case back to lower courts. Related Zubik v.",
        "In most tellings, the current age of superhero movies began in earnest in 2000, with Bryan Singer\u2019s . That relatively modest film, built around a pair of classically trained Brits and an Australian actor with a background in musical theater, proved that audiences would turn out for reasonably faithful adaptations of classic comic book stories. And it set in motion a new wave of superhero films \u2014 from Sam Raimi\u2019s series to Christopher Nolan\u2019s Batman trilogy to Marvel\u2019s catalog of Avengers and blockbusters, not to mention a host of efforts.",

        "A man who lost most of his genitals to penile cancer just received the first penis transplant in the United States. It\u2019s only the third time the highly experimental procedure has been done worldwide. On May 8 and 9, transplant surgeons at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston gave Thomas Manning the new organ from a deceased donor, according to Denise Grady, who broke the story for the New York Times. Related Uterus transplants are extremely risky. Doctors should keep doing them anyway.",
        "President Trump repeatedly called Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) \u201dPocahontas\u201d as an insult on the campaign trail, and he apparently hasn\u2019t stopped. In a meeting with senators Thursday, Politico reported, Trump referred to Warren as \u201dPocahontas\u201d several times, and also told Democrats at the meeting that he\u2019s glad Warren is becoming the face of \u201dyour party.\u201d Trump also, once again, brought up his baseless conspiracy theory blaming widespread voter fraud for his loss of the popular vote. \u201dPocahontas\u201d has apparently become Trump\u2019s favorite nickname for Warren, who has said that she had Cherokee ancestors.",
        "Donald Trump is a bigot. This is not exactly a secret. He rose to political prominence by claiming the first black president wasn\u2019t really American but Kenyan. He launched his presidential campaign by calling Mexican immigrants to the US \u201drapists,\u201d and doubled down when criticized. His most famous proposal is a total moratorium on Muslim entry to the United States. But a report from the New York Times\u2019s Michael Barbaro and Megan Twohey has shone a light on a less examined side of Trump\u2019s bigotry: his long, persistent hatred and mistreatment of women.",
        "CANNES, France \u2014 Compared with other monumental events in the history of the civil rights movement, it\u2019s disheartening that the story of Richard and Mildred Loving isn\u2019t more . That will change with the release of Jeff Nichols\u2019s Loving, which premiered at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival on Monday. After they got married in 1958, the Virginia couple was quickly arrested by a local sheriff for breaking the state\u2019s law, which banned marriages between people of different races.",
        "Sen. Cory Booker acknowledges that the Senate\u2019s criminal justice bill is not perfect. But he doesn\u2019t hesitate to point out that \u201dit\u2019s in my lifetime the first reversal of mass incarceration in the federal level.\u201d The legislation contains some big compromises: It keeps many mandatory minimum sentences, does not shorten sentences for violent offenders, and adds a new mandatory sentencing enhancement for fentanyl, a powerful opioid, when it\u2019s present in trafficked heroin.",
        "Few security measures have proven as enduring as the creation of the Transportation Security Administration, which effectively nationalized airport security and dramatically increased screening procedures on flights. In a matter of months, flights went from something you could arrive 30 minutes to an hour beforehand and be fine to something you needed to budget two hours for, what with the shoe removal and the liquids and the possibility of a random . It\u2019s annoying, but it\u2019s also worse than annoying.",
        "There is one thing we know for certain about the 2016 election: The night of November 8, a version of this map will be all over cable news. That\u2019s a shame. Because this map tells you almost nothing about how Americans are voting. Anytime you visualize data, you have to prioritize. In the case of these maps, the highest priority is geographic accuracy. Want to know which states border Indiana? This map has you covered. Want to know which candidate is closest to winning? Good luck. This map prioritizes geographic accuracy over electoral importance.",
        "Today we\u2019re so used to runners that we practically ignore them. But as the above video shows, it wasn\u2019t always that way. Back in the 1960s, jogging was typically reserved for athletes. Normal people mostly didn\u2019t do it \u2014 and when they did, it was cause for concern. The New York Times ran an amused trend piece in 1968 about the handful of unusual freaks who chose to run in their free time. (You can see more classic jogging articles in this piece I wrote last year).",
        "It\u2019s time to accept a harsh truth: Bernie Sanders is not going to win the Democratic nomination to be President of the United States. If you live in the world of politics, this may come as no surprise. But lots of people might still be confused about this. After all, Sanders is still in the race while all the candidates but Donald Trump have dropped out on the Republican side. Sanders himself might be part of the reason about 40 percent of his supporters don\u2019t think Hillary Clinton is the most likely person to become the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee.",
        "A few days ago, a couple of middle schoolers in Colorado wrote me about their class project. \u201dWe are trying to learn more about ways to stop the burning of fossil fuels,\u201d they said. \u201dIs there any way that we, as middle schoolers, can stop this?\u201d I thought I would share my reply, in case there are other young people out there reading. Dear [earnest, adorable middle schoolers] Sounds like a cool project! You are definitely asking the right question.",
        "It has long struck me as puzzling that Bernie Sanders refers to his ideology \u2014 which I would characterize as social democracy or even just welfare state liberalism \u2014 as democratic socialism, a politically loaded term that seems to imply policy commitments Sanders hasn\u2019t made to things like government ownership of major industries.",
        "Every May, the TV networks announce their fall schedules to advertisers at an event called the upfronts. They aim to sell their new shows to ad buyers at the highest possible price, while the ad buyers try to stay skeptical. It\u2019s an antiquated ritual that, nonetheless, is enormously important to the business of TV, and we\u2019ll be there all week.",
        "For weeks, Hillary Clinton has looked for the knockout blow that finally forces Bernie Sanders out of the Democratic primary. She may have gotten it tonight in Kentucky.

        "For the first time on national television, Megyn Kelly on Tuesday confronted Donald Trump about one of the many insults he\u2019s used against her: \u201dbimbo.\u201d Trump\u2019s reaction was decidedly not very Trumpian. He shifted awkwardly, grinned, and said, \u201dExcuse me.\u201d After some awkward silence, he gave his excuse: \u201dOver your life, Megyn, you\u2019ve been called a lot worse. Is that right, wouldn\u2019t you say? You know, you\u2019ve had a life that\u2019s not been that easy.\u201d Kelly\u2019s response: \u201dIt\u2019s not about me.",
        "Bernie Sanders doesn\u2019t have a realistic path to the Democratic nomination, even with superdelegates excluded, and hasn\u2019t had one for more than two months now. Yet the Vermont senator has remained in the race, and has repeatedly suggested he\u2019ll fight it out \u201duntil the last vote is cast.\u201d Indeed, on Tuesday night he said he still intended to win \u201da majority of pledged delegates,\u201d even though he has to win the remaining contests by enormous margins to pull that off.",
        "This week, the National Academies of Sciences released the most thorough review yet of genetically modified crops \u2014 a hulking report. It\u2019s an independent look at all the research on GMOs to date, vetted for conflicts of interest. I\u2019ll start with a quick, crude summary and then dive into the nuances of what the expert committee found. The crude summary goes like so: Despite all the controversy, the GM crops available to date \u2014 mostly a few crops engineered to be resistant to herbicides or to pests \u2014 are considered just as safe to eat as conventional crops.",
        "We talk about metabolism like it\u2019s something we can manipulate by gulping a pill, downing some green tea, or running faster. You\u2019ve seen the articles headlined \u201dBoost your metabolism\u201d or \u201dTry this diet to lose weight.\u201d But this obscures many truths about this essential, yet still somewhat mysterious, biological process. Here are nine facts to help you understand metabolism, and how to think about it in the context of weight gain and weight loss.",

        "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is on a roll. On Tuesday, he cheered women\u2019s rights advocates by lifting the country\u2019s ban on using foreign aid money for abortion services. He\u2019s reversed the policy of his predecessor and enthusiastically welcomed 25, 000 Syrian refugees. He implemented a tax cut for Canadians, cutting the second tax bracket from 22 percent to 20. 5 percent, and raised the top rate from 29 to 33 percent for Canadians making more than $155, 000."
