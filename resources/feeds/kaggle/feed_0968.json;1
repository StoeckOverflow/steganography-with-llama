        "When writer and journalist Coates published Between the World and Me last year, he received a fair amount of critique, chief among them that the book generalized the black American identity to be equivalent to his own experience as an man. That was never his intention, Coates told New York Times Magazine reporter Nikole : He hoped his book would inspire readers to then explore other works by black writers. \u201dI don\u2019t want this book to be the black book,\u201d Coates said.",
        "A Supreme Court case about juries may not sound like the most exciting legal battle of all time. But in Foster v. Chatman, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on how juries work could have a big impact on issues that are definitely getting a lot of attention in America today \u2014 mainly, the death penalty and the racism in the criminal justice system. On Monday, the Supreme Court effectively refused to weaken a legal rule that makes it harder for prosecutors to stuff juries with exclusively white jurors.",
        "The first rule of stories is almost always that when you try to meddle in the past, you inevitably wind up creating the present you were hoping to avoid. This is at once ironically satisfying and allows for time travel to logically exist.",
        "The internet abounds with articles about massive \u201dislands\u201d of plastic floating around in the middle of the ocean. This narrative conjures up images of trash piles congregated in certain locations, leaving the rest of the sea clear of debris. But the reality is much grimmer. A map from New Zealand \u2014 based data visualization firm Dumpark, reminds us that the ocean\u2019s plastic is not centralized, but rather is universally prevalent in tiny, pieces. . . iframe, . object, .",

        "Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising believes at least one truth to be : that all dirtbags are created equal. Rating 4 This sentiment is part of what made 2014\u2019s surprise hit Neighbors so much fun, as Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen\u2019s flustered new parents tried to take down Delta Psi, the disruptive frat next door, and its leader, Teddy (Zac Efron).

        "As mosquito season arrives and the Zika virus threatens the United States, Congress has been slow to provide the funding President Obama requested to fight the disease. Ronald Klain, who managed the response to Ebola in 2014, argues in the Washington Post that this is a mistake with foreseeable, tragic consequences: Zika is not \u201dcoming\u201d to the United States: It is already here.",
        "Bernie Sanders has outperformed everyone\u2019s expectations for his 2016 primary campaign, but he is overwhelmingly likely at this point to lose the nomination. It\u2019s a frustrating situation for Sanders personally and even more frustrating for many of Sanders\u2019s supporters, who tend to be on the younger side and likely haven\u2019t yet had the experience of getting emotionally invested in a campaign that ends up losing.",
        "Two weeks ago, I wrote that Hillary Clinton\u2019s polling lead over Donald Trump wasn\u2019t very big, and could vanish. Well, it\u2019s vanished! A spate of new polls has pushed Trump into the lead against Clinton in the RealClearPolitics average for the first time ever \u2014 he is now ahead of her by 0. 2 percentage points. Clinton is still in front in the HuffPost Pollster average, but just barely, with her lead having narrowed to a mere 1. 6 percent.",
        "Robert Murray is the founder and CEO of Murray Energy Corp. an coal mining company. He blames the troubles facing the coal industry entirely on Democrats and has led lawsuits against Obama administration energy policies. Speaking at a conference on Monday, Murray recounted that about a week ago, Donald Trump summoned him in for a meeting, to reassure him that Trump is a friend of coal. During the meeting, as Trump asked about various aspects of energy, Murray suggested lifting the ban on liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports.",
        "Speaking to the Washington Post on Monday, Donald Trump referred to \u201dvery serious\u201d allegations that there was foul play involved in the death of White House staffer Vince Foster in the early months of the Clinton administration. Deeming the circumstances of Foster\u2019s death \u201dvery fishy,\u201d Trump observed that Foster \u201dknew everything that was going on, and then all of a sudden he committed suicide.\u201d In truth, there is nothing fishy about Foster\u2019s death. In fact, few if any suicides have been investigated as thoroughly \u2014 or repeatedly \u2014 as Foster\u2019s, and it\u2019s very clear what happened to him.",
        "The battle to retake the Iraqi city of Fallujah has begun: 20, 000 Iraqi soldiers, backed by US air power and advisers, are attempting to expel some 800 to 1, 000 ISIS fighters. This is now the third time since 2003 that US and Iraqi forces have fought to retake Fallujah (building on an even longer British tradition of retaking Fallujah.) But the question is not whether the US and its allies will win in Fallujah \u2014 they always do. The real question is whether it will finally matter.",
        "This week, one of the most brutal competitions known to man begins. It\u2019s time for the 2016 Scripps National Spelling Bee. Dreams will be broken, kids will be crushed, and when these competitors strike out, the words that tripped them up will be burned into their brains for the rest of their lives. When the dust settles, one speller out of 285 will rise and be crowned the kid in the nation. From the favorites to the underdogs to some of the Bee\u2019s most notable moments, here\u2019s your guide to this year\u2019s competition.",
        "Bernie Sanders has been characterized throughout his career as an idealistic outsider with unrealistically policy proposals that go far beyond what\u2019s politically feasible. It turns out he\u2019d like his top allies at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia this July to be of a similar cast. On Monday, after a major concession from the Democratic National Committee gave him the ability to do so, Sanders announced his five choices for the \u201dplatform committee\u201d that will write the party\u2019s officials positions.",
        "For the past few years, criminal justice policy has widely been considered an area ripe for reform from Democrats and Republicans. They want to make the system less punitive and pull back mass incarceration \u2014 a rare show of bipartisanship in an increasingly polarized political climate. Then came Donald Trump. On the campaign trail, the Republican presidential candidate has been somewhat of an enigma on criminal justice issues. Trump\u2019s website includes no platform on criminal justice issues.",
        "The University of Texas Austin was Abigail Fisher\u2019s dream school. Fisher, from Sugar Land, Texas, a wealthy Houston suburb, earned a 3. 59 GPA in high school and scored an 1180 on the SATs. Not bad, but not enough for the highly selective UT Austin in fall 2008; Fisher\u2019s dreams were dashed when she was denied admission. In response, Fisher sued. Her argument? That applicants of color, whose racial backgrounds were included as a component of the university\u2019s holistic review process, were students and had displaced her.",
        "The World Health Organization has some good news for the world: Babies born today are likely to live longer than ever before, and the gains are particularly dramatic in the parts of the world where life expectancy has lagged most. Worldwide, life expectancy is just under 74 years for women and just over 69 years for men. Babies born today across Africa can expect to live almost 10 years longer than those born in 2000, the biggest gains in life expectancy anywhere in the world.",

Unlike other awards, the Billboard Awards are determined strictly by chart performance, rather than a vote from a guild, for example.

        "Intelligence quotient \u2014 or IQ \u2014 can be an awkward topic. As I wrote yesterday, there\u2019s a mountain of research showing that it\u2019s a genuinely powerful predictor of your health, prosperity, and . But because IQ is partially hereditary, and resistant to change, it conflicts with a lot of modern values about . Today there\u2019s an endless supply of psychological books and TED talks that are dismissive of IQ, or argue that it can be supplanted.

        "Ever since Tulsa, Oklahoma, launched America\u2019s first bike share back in 2007, more than 94 cities around the country have built similar systems. And one neat thing about this rapid expansion is the subtle innovations that occur as more networks get built. Case in point: This summer, Cleveland will start rolling out a new system, known as UHBikes, that will aim for at least 70 stations and 700 bikes by 2020. One twist here is that riders won\u2019t have to park their bikes at docking stations. For a small fee, they can leave them anywhere else in the city.",
        "Bitcoin has struggled to live up to the hype that surrounded its emergence into the mainstream three years ago. Despite more than a billion dollars of venture capital funding, Bitcoin startups have failed to develop applications that appeal to mainstream customers. And over the past year, the Bitcoin community has become paralyzed by a bitter feud over how \u2014 and whether \u2014 to expand the network\u2019s capacity. The result: For the first time since its creation, Bitcoin is in danger of losing its status as the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency.",
        "President Barack Obama\u2019s historic visit to Hiroshima, Japan, on May 27 to honor the memory of those killed and injured when the US dropped the atomic bomb on the city in 1945, comes, ironically, as the argument that Japan should reconsider the nuclear option has reemerged. But it is not the Japanese who are breaking the \u201dnuclear taboo\u201d; it is a prominent American: the Republican Party\u2019s presumptive nominee for president. Japan has long eschewed the acquisition of nuclear weapons, choosing instead to rely on the United States to deter any potential threat from its nuclear neighbors.",
        "A few weeks ago, I went to a Trump press conference and asked Donald Trump a question that launched quite the media firestorm when it prompted him to say, \u201dFrankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don\u2019t think she\u2019d get 5 percent of the vote. The only thing she\u2019s got going is the woman\u2019s card.\u201d Those comments were pretty bizarre, even for the Donald. But the Republican frontrunner didn\u2019t stop there. He also said, \u201dAll of the men, we\u2019re petrified to speak to women anymore. We may raise our voice. You know what?",
        "This week we learned that billionaire Peter Thiel, who made his fortune as a of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook, has been bankrolling a lawsuit that could drive Gawker Media out of business. The story was first reported by Forbes and confirmed by Thiel himself in a Wednesday interview with the New York Times. \u201dIt\u2019s not like it is some sort of speaking truth to power or something going on here,\u201d Thiel argued. \u201dThe way I\u2019ve thought about this is that Gawker has been a singularly terrible bully.",
        "Venezuela is in the midst of a stunning social, political, and economic collapse. The country of 30 million people is facing dire food and medicine shortages, frequent power outages, serious political unrest, the world\u2019s highest inflation rate, rampant violent crime, and one of the world\u2019s highest murder rates. Earlier this month, Venezuela\u2019s president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, declared a state of emergency. In short, Venezuela has become the world\u2019s most visibly failing state. It wasn\u2019t supposed to go like this. Not so long ago, Venezuela\u2019s socialist revolution attracted its share of fellow travelers \u2014 idealists hungry for the next earthly utopia.",
        "For as long as I can remember, I have been an avid viewer and fan of the Scripps National Spelling Bee. I love everything about it, from the nerdy kids getting their moment in the spotlight on ESPN to their sheer excitement when they get a word right. Recently, though, I\u2019ve noticed a disturbing problem with the Spelling Bee \u2014 one that could doom its existence as a great American pastime. My fears became amplified last night, watching the 2016 Scripps National Spelling Bee.",
        "Hillary Clinton is overwhelmingly likely to win the Democratic nomination, but it\u2019s been close. So far she\u2019s taken 1, 768 delegates in primaries and caucuses, while Bernie Sanders has secured 1, 497. The same can\u2019t be said for the \u201dinvisible primary\u201d: the contest for top endorsements, institutional backing, and key staffers. According to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s endorsement tracker, Clinton is routing Sanders among party elites: 511 members of Congress or governors have endorsed Clinton; only 13 have endorsed Sanders. So while Sanders has 85 percent as many pledged delegates as Clinton, he has only 2.",
        "Indoor air pollution gets surprisingly little attention for such a lethal public health problem. It kills more people each year than and malaria combined, but few countries treat it as a crisis on the same level. The basic story: About 3 billion people around the world \u2014 mostly in Africa and Asia, and mostly very poor \u2014 don\u2019t have access to modern energy and still cook and heat their homes by burning coal, charcoal, dung, wood, or plant residue indoors.",
        "Bill Cosby is standing trial in Pennsylvania for sexual assault, and a preliminary hearing Tuesday revealed just how ugly that trial could get. Andrea Constand is so far the only one of Cosby\u2019s nearly 60 alleged victims who is seeing her day in court, for a 2004 incident where she says Cosby drugged and raped her. Some women simply didn\u2019t want to press charges; others want to but can\u2019t because the statute of limitations has run out."
