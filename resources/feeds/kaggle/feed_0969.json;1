        "The federal government spends more than $160 billion each year on subsidies for college, but nobody believes the country has come remotely close to meeting the goal of universal college affordability. By contrast, under the landmark 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the share of uninsured Americans has dropped by roughly and is now at a historic low. The number of Americans struggling to pay medical bills or forgoing care because of costs has also fallen. Increased college grant money during the same period, meanwhile, boosted the number of students receiving this assistance by roughly 2 million people.",
        "The international community has been talking about climate change since the 1980s, with a continuous procession of meetings, accords, treaties, and declarations. All the while, global carbon emissions have continued to rise. Even the Paris climate accord signed in December, as promising as it is, falls well short of what the nations involved say is needed. And it is mostly composed of promises and pledges. Actual, tangible action to restrain carbon emissions remains vanishingly modest relative to the amount of talk and diplomatic attention that have been lavished on the problem.",
        "On Wednesday, the State Department\u2019s inspector general released a report on the email practices of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, other former secretaries of state, and the State Department more broadly.",
        "Every week, Todd VanDerWerff, Caroline Framke, and Libby Nelson gather to talk about the latest episode of The Americans. Read our complete coverage of the show here. Spoilers, needless to say, follow. A scattered episode; a thrilling ending Todd VanDerWerff: What matters, Pastor Tim tells Elizabeth, isn\u2019t religion or God or prayer or going to church. What matters is how we treat other people. That\u2019s as true whether you\u2019re an atheist, like Elizabeth, or a Christian, like Tim. We can all think of who are great people and religious people who are awful, and vice versa.",
        "Nobody wants to be a number. But there is one number that probably says a lot about you, whether you know it or not: your IQ, or intelligence quotient. IQ is often dismissed as antiquated, misguided, or less important than personality traits. But according to Stuart Ritchie, an intelligence researcher at the University of Edinburgh, there\u2019s a massive amount of data showing that it\u2019s one of the best predictors of someone\u2019s longevity, health, and prosperity. And psychologists have been able to replicate these findings over and over.",
        "Sherrod Brown looks in some ways like a very tempting vice presidential pick for Hillary Clinton. He doesn\u2019t have an enormous national profile, but inside the Beltway he\u2019s known as a stalwart of the liberal wing of the party\u2019s congressional caucus. Unlike Bernie Sanders, he\u2019s a loyal party man. But he has a similar disheveled populist to go along with an extensive track record of support for labor unions and skepticism of the forces of globalization.

        "Big changes are coming for the automobile industry, and everyone in the industry knows it. This week, Ford and the Chinese technology company Baidu announced a $150 million investment in Velodyne, makers of powerful LIDAR sensors that are widely used in cars.",
        "Terumi Tanaka was 13 when the atomic bomb exploded a mile and a half from his Nagasaki home. He was knocked unconscious but survived, protected by several hills between him and the epicenter. Five members of his family were not as fortunate. He remembers finding the charred bodies of his aunt and cousins outside their home; another aunt was severely burned, and when she died several days later, he and his mother cremated her themselves in a nearby field.",
        "When it comes to energy policy, the 2016 presidential election really isn\u2019t all that complicated. Hillary Clinton plans to continue President Obama\u2019s strategy of pushing down carbon dioxide emissions via regulations. That means using less coal and oil and more wind and solar. Donald Trump, by contrast, doesn\u2019t much care about global warming and plans to greatly expand US oil drilling and coal mining \u2014 largely by repealing various environmental rules. On May 26, Trump fleshed out his vision in a speech at an oil industry conference in Bismarck, North Dakota. There were no real surprises.",
        "The internet has produced many strange fads throughout the years, from cats getting scared of cucumbers to the weirdly unsettling Lenny Face. But none of these memes have anything on the latest internet phenomenon \u2014 one that\u2019s literally described as a frog riding a unicycle. Here come dat boi. (O shit waddup!) At first glance, this seemingly inscrutable frog may not seem like it stands for much of anything. But you shouldn\u2019t underestimate dat boi1. For reasons beyond human comprehension, this frog can produce some hilarious images \u2014 the lifeblood of a good meme. o shit waddup!",
        "Sweetbitter, a buzzy new debut novel by Stephanie Danler released this week, might be swallowed up by its own buzz. That\u2019s unfortunate, because it\u2019s a lovely book. In the month before its publication, Sweetbitter was caught up in a controversy about the outsize influence that authors\u2019 physical appearance can have in publishing \u2014 and part of the controversy was about whether Danler\u2019s good looks had affected her book deal, by leading her publisher to invest disproportionate resources in her work. That question is foreshadowed in Sweetbitter itself.",
        "Bathrooms didn\u2019t seem like a huge issue just a few months ago, but it now seems like they have turned the 2016 presidential election into a very crucial one for LGBTQ rights. LGBTQ rights have always been an important aspect of the presidential race, of course. But the recent debate over bathrooms and whether transgender people, who identify with a gender different from the one assigned to them at birth, should be able to use the facilities for their gender identity has elevated these issues.",
        "How do you spell \u2019 \u2019? Just ask the hardcore winners of this year\u2019s Scripps National Spelling Bee. (Full disclosure: this reporter is a former National Spelling Bee contestant. I dropped out after misspelling \u201dnarcissist,\u201d which is a pretty good word to claim you\u2019ve never heard before.) For the third straight year, this year\u2019s Bee ended in a tie, after an intense between the .",
        "In the reaction to the Obama administration\u2019s guidance for transgender people and school bathrooms, there has been a very consistent misconception perpetuated by journalists, pundits, and even some legal experts: that the guidance is based on some new, unheard of legal principle. The idea behind the guidance is that existing federal civil rights laws that ban sex discrimination, including Title IX (for education) also protect trans people, because discrimination is rooted in expectations of what people of certain sexes should be like.",
        "I hate to pick on a fellow news outlet, but this was a breathtaking example of irresponsible science hype from Mother Jones: No. Please stop this. No one has established that cellphones cause cancer, particularly in humans. That headline and image combo is wildly misleading. You can find other bad headlines here and here.",
        "Everything a tiny fraction of the internet knows about an obscure TV show called Street Sharks is a lie. Geek. com writer Jordan Minor announced on Thursday that in the early 2000s, he made a habit of trolling a site called TV Tome by adding a bunch of fake information about the syndicated cartoon, which aired for three seasons in the \u201990s.",
        "France is in the midst of a strike. While not a shocking statement \u2014 striking is seemingly as synonymous with French culture as the stereotypical image of a Frenchman in stripes and a beret \u2014 these strikes, over a proposal to reform the nation\u2019s labor laws, have brought France to a near standstill. In a country where nuclear power production provides 75 percent of the electricity, nearly 16 of the 18 plants are said to be affected by the strikes, the BBC reported.",
        "Since March, the nation\u2019s biggest airports have been in the grips of a line apocalypse. Security lines have metastasized. What were once unusually long waits have become routine. Big airports are threatening to kick out the Transportation Security Administration and turn the security process back over to private contractors. Watch the security line at DIA grow. From 4:30, to 5:00, to 5:45. Now it\u2019s almost to baggage claim @DenverChannel pic. twitter. \u2014 Jason Gruenauer (@JGonTV) May 26, 2016 The lines aren\u2019t invariably nightmarish at every airport, all day long.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s speech this week at a petroleum conference in North Dakota showcased the energy policies we can expect from a Trump administration. But more importantly, it revealed a great deal about how Trump will develop and manage policy. Pretty much everything it revealed was terrifying. Trump reads his speech and discovers what his policies are Most of what you need to know about the content of Trump\u2019s speech you can find in Brad Plumer\u2019s post about it. Suffice to say, it was nonsense, filled with basic errors and promises that cannot conceivably be kept.",
        "The moderators of the Democratic presidential debates did not ask a single question about poverty in any of the nine contests held over seven months, according to a new report released Friday. The candidates themselves brought up poverty a total of 17 times, but the topic wasn\u2019t raised once by any of the debate hosts, says media watchdog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR). Here\u2019s FAIR\u2019s Adam Johnson: A FAIR analysis of all nine democratic debates over the past seven months shows that not one question was asked about poverty.",
        "Somewhere in the middle of Alice Through the Looking Glass, I started doing math in my head. Rating 1 My brain, so exhausted and assaulted by everything happening onscreen, threw up a surrender flag, crawled into a bunker, and started amusing itself by trying to run calculations on how far a clock\u2019s hour hand travels over certain periods of time. That\u2019s how desperately I wanted out of Wonderland. So it goes with Looking Glass, one of the more unnecessary sequels in an age of unnecessary sequels.",
        "Originally published on Grist. How do you get people to do something about climate change? For years, the answer has been to prod people into thinking about their role in causing it, to guilt trip them into action. Because any human who happens to live in North America has taken advantage of central heating, combustion engines, and the occasional monster truck rally. A recent study in the scientific journal Climatic Change has a surprising take on this longstanding practice.",
        "Every week throughout season six, a handful of Vox\u2019s writers will discuss the latest episode of Game of Thrones. Before you dig in, check out our recap of Sunday\u2019s episode, as well the archive of our entire discussion to date. Next up is politics writer Andrew Prokop. Andrew Prokop: Emily, among the many ways to interpret the scene where Arya watches a Braavosi theater troop reenact her father\u2019s downfall, perhaps my favorite is that Arya is a fan of George R. R. Martin\u2019s books, gazing on with horror at how that crude, gratuitous HBO adaptation gets so much wrong!",
        "The viral video of a high school student flipping a water bottle so that it lands straight upright on a table has set the internet ablaze. With the pressure of his peers looking on, Michael Senatore, a senior at Ardrey Kell High School in Charlotte, North Carolina, flipped a Deer Park water bottle through the air, landing it perfectly vertical on a table. The theatrics, the focus, the precision, and the reaction of the audience help make this seemingly pedestrian feat extraordinary.",
        "Earlier this week, I wrote about how Lake Mead, America\u2019s largest reservoir, has shrunk to its lowest level ever. It\u2019s a huge deal for the 25 million people in California, Arizona, Nevada, and Mexico who depend on freshwater from this crucial system. Now NASA\u2019s Earth Observatory has posted two satellite images that show the dramatic decline of Lake Mead between 2000 and 2015.",
        "Originally published on Grist. Tristan knew the end was near when his dad turned yellow. Two years earlier, his father, Jake Seniuk, had been diagnosed with a rare form of small intestine cancer. He tried chemo, he tried radiation, and then he tried ayahuasca, a plant native to Peru that is used in traditional healing ceremonies. In addition to making you violently ill, ayahuasca gives you visions \u2014 wild, spectacular visions. Jake had taken ayahuasca a few years before, after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, and he attributed his recovery to the plant.",
        "If you\u2019ve ever rolled your eyes at someone calling a meal a \u201ddining experience,\u201d Chef\u2019s Table probably isn\u2019t for you. Netflix\u2019s documentary series \u2014 which debuted its second season on May 27 \u2014 isn\u2019t interested in exposing gritty underbellies or shady characters. It just wants to show you some beautiful food cooked by the world\u2019s most lauded chefs, and has saved you a seat at restaurants where only a tiny fraction of the world will ever dine.",
        "After watching the Bloodline season two premiere, I joked to my wife that the show might as well be called Things Are About to Happen: The TV Show. I had no idea how right I was. Rating 2. 5 In its first season, Bloodline tried my patience by endlessly spinning plates covered in portent that seemed like they might never add up to anything.",
        "It is generally that there is a life expectancy gap between white and black Americans of about four years. But it can be hard to visualize exactly what this number means. In a recent conversation, David Williams, a public health researcher at Harvard, described the racial gap to me in stark terms: One of the ways to think of the racial gap in health is to think of how many black people die prematurely every year who wouldn\u2019t die if there were no racial differences in health.",
        "Hillary Clinton threw grassroots liberals a bone on Thursday by declaring Elizabeth Warren \u201dqualified\u201d to be her vice president. She didn\u2019t really say much more than that she respected Warren, and views her as \u201dan incredible public servant, eminently qualified for any role.\u201d But given the intense fervor for a ticket among base Democrats, even that will probably be enough to get some hopes up. It\u2019s remarkable how fast discussion of Clinton\u2019s selection process has been reduced to the question of if she\u2019ll pick Warren, but it\u2019s also understandable."
