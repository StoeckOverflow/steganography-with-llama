        "Nicholas Kristof, a liberal columnist with the New York Times, made a pronouncement in early May: Higher education in the United States suffers from an unchecked \u201dliberal privilege.\u201d \u201dIt\u2019s easier to find a Marxist in some disciplines than a Republican,\u201d Kristof commented on the \u201dendangered species\u201d (Republicans) of academia in his column for the Times. The piece received widespread consensus, Kristof wrote in his Sunday column, commenting on the feedback: \u201dAlmost every liberal agreed I was dead wrong.\u201d Nonetheless, Kristof reiterated his claim: Stereotyping and discrimination are wrong, whether against gays or Muslims, or against conservatives or evangelicals.",
        "Liam Clive\u2019s voice rings with excitement as he races through the potential for Bernie Sanders\u2019s movement to \u201drevolutionize\u201d Congress after the presidential campaign. \u201dThe first step is to really capitalize on the incredible and unexpected momentum and how much the Sanders message has resonated across the country to elect more progressive members to the United States Congress,\u201d he says. Clive is a in Hawaii who says he finished high school last year and worked on Sanders\u2019s campaign in the fall.",
        "I was a horrible lacrosse player in high school: bad at catching the ball, slow, and not very aggressive. Yet I\u2019d spend hours at a handball wall with my stick: throwing, catching, repeating. I played on winter leagues, and woke up early for 6 am pickup games. Freshman and sophomore years, I made it onto the junior varsity team \u2014 a miracle. By 11th grade, it was time to try out for varsity lacrosse. This is when my history teacher \u2014 the varsity coach \u2014 pulled me aside and suggested I shouldn\u2019t bother.",
        "To really understand : Apocalypse, you have look back to director Bryan Singer\u2019s first film about the team of superpowered mutants. Released 16 years ago this summer, was the first fully formed entry in the modern superhero movie canon, and it played a major role in launching the current comic book movie boom. succeeded largely on the strength of its faithfulness to the tone and character of the comics.",
        "Originally published on Ensia. When New England fishers complained of working harder and harder to catch fewer and fewer fish, Spencer Baird assembled a scientific team to investigate. Though a fishery failure would once have seemed inconceivable, Baird wrote in his report, \u201dan alarming decrease of the has been thoroughly established by my own investigations, as well as by evidence of those whose testimony was taken.\u201d The report was Baird\u2019s first as head of the US Commission of Fish and Fisheries. The year was 1872. Baird recognized the ocean\u2019s limits.",
        "Today is World Elephant Day, and advocates say there are some things to celebrate. For one, it appears that less than 5 percent of elephants are now illegally killed each year \u2014 the first time the number has dipped below 5 percent since 2009. This is important because the elephant populations normally grows at about 5 percent a year, so this number might hint at a recovery. Meanwhile, ivory prices are plummeting, meaning the primary driver of poaching \u2014 consumer demand \u2014 is leveling off.",
        "The greatest advice book ever published was written by Marjorie Hillis, the editor of Vogue circa 1936. It\u2019s called Live Alone and Like It, and it\u2019s addressed to what was then a new social category, emerging in the aftermath of the Great Depression: bachelor ladies, or \u201cthe \u201d \u2014 women who live on their own, without husbands or parents (but maybe don\u2019t like it).",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s political operation is clearly somewhat undecided about what line of attack to take against Donald Trump, and no Democratic Party presidential campaign would be complete without a small army of backseat drivers ready to second guess the candidate. So I don\u2019t doubt that the substance of what Amy Chozick, Alexander Burns, and Jonathan Martin report in their article \u201dHillary Clinton Struggles to Find Footing in Unusual Race\u201d is true.",
        "Harambe, a western lowland gorilla, turned 17 at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden on Friday. The zoo celebrated his birthday. The next day, zoo officials shot and killed the critically endangered ape. The reason? Harambe acted like a gorilla. On the day Harambe died, a boy managed to get into his enclosure. Video of the incident shows that Harambe grabbed the child, stood over him at times, and dragged him. The severity of Harambe\u2019s actions and the perceived reasoning behind them depend on whom you ask.",
        "The news out of the Great Barrier Reef keeps getting worse and worse. For months, the northern half of Australia\u2019s famed coral reef has been ravaged by an unprecedented mass bleaching event. Record high temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, fueled by global warming and a powerful El Ni\u00f1o, have turned this once vibrant ecosystem into a ghastly pale white tableau. Now scientists are assessing the fallout \u2014 and it\u2019s grim. On Sunday, Australian researchers estimated that 35 percent of the corals in the northern and central part of the reef are either dead or dying.",
        "Spoilers follow for Game of Thrones season six, episode six, \u201dBlood of my Blood.\u201d After the disastrous events of last week\u2019s episode of Game of Thrones, in which Hodor and several other of Bran Stark\u2019s allies died tragically at the White Walkers\u2019 hands, this Sunday\u2019s installment finally gave poor Bran some good news \u2026 well, sorta good news. Just as all looked lost for Bran and Meera Reed, the two were dramatically saved from attacking wights by a mysterious figure \u2014 and that figure turned out to be Bran\u2019s uncle, Benjen Stark.",
        "If you want to understand how Donald Trump became Donald Trump, you could do worse than talk to the reporter who\u2019s been following him since he was an young man in a \u201dmodest\u201d apartment. In the late 1970s, when Trump was a hotshot young real estate developer trying to make his mark on New York City, Wayne Barrett was a hotshot young Village Voice reporter trying to do the same thing. Trump invited Barrett to his Fifth Avenue apartment. \u201dIt was . .. beige,\u201d Barrett recalls. \u201dAnd it was a very simple apartment.",
        "Bernie Sanders keeps saying that regardless of what happens on today in California and New Jersey, he\u2019ll fight on against Hillary Clinton all the way to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in late July. There\u2019s a reason he\u2019s saying that. Clinton, after all, will have won a majority of pledged delegates but not an absolute majority of overall delegates. That means, in theory, if Sanders can persuade a huge number of superdelegates to back him, he could become the nominee.",
        "Eduardo Porter\u2019s broadside against a universal basic income focuses almost entirely on the cost and efficiency of cutting every American a check that would keep them out of poverty. But the harder \u2014 and more important \u2014 question around a UBI is about how it interacts with our culture of work. And the truth is I have no idea how to answer it. Here is the question: Could we respect people who live off a universal basic income? Porter thinks not. Work, he writes, \u201dis not just what people do for a living. It is a source of status.",
        "On May 27, NASA posted the most detailed photos of Pluto\u2019s surface ever taken, an absolutely stunning look at the dwarf planet\u2019s mountains, craters, and nitrogen ice plains. This is likely to be the best Pluto we\u2019ll have for a long, long time. Check out the video below: The images were taken by NASA\u2019s New Horizons craft on July 14, 2015, as it flew by Pluto. But they\u2019re only being publicized now, 10 months later. And that delay has provoked, uh, consternation from one Fox News anchor: Why did they wait until NOW to release these?",
        "On May 3, Poland celebrated the 225th anniversary of its constitution, usually considered Europe\u2019s first modern constitution. Created only two years after the US Constitution came into force, it too was heavily influenced by principles of the Enlightenment, and incorporated ideas like bicameral legislatures and the freedom to practice any religion that are normal features of today\u2019s democracies. This year, though, Poland\u2019s Constitution Day celebrations were marred by a major constitutional crisis over recent legal reforms implemented by the ruling party.",
        "The internet is on fire over the death of another animal: Harambe the gorilla. It\u2019s the latest example of social media causing the death of an animal to proliferate, enabling all sorts of internet outrage about how this could possibly be allowed to happen. Even before the details were clear, or before the experts chimed in, people around the web quickly decried the gorilla\u2019s killing and the events that led up to it.",
        "Last week, Warner Bros. issued a DMCA takedown notice to the video streaming website Vimeo. The notice concerned a pretty standard list of illegally uploaded files from media properties Warner owns the copyright to \u2014 including episodes of Friends and Pretty Little Liars, as well as two uploads featuring footage from the Ridley Scott movie Blade Runner. Just a routine example of copyright infringement, right? Not exactly. Warner Bros. had just made a fascinating mistake. Some of the Blade Runner footage \u2014 which Warner has since reinstated \u2014 wasn\u2019t actually Blade Runner footage.",
        "Anyone who\u2019s set foot in a supermarket or farmers market in, oh, the past decade has noticed that organic food is considerably pricier than conventional food. But this \u201dorganic premium\u201d \u2014 the difference between the two \u2014 can vary widely from product to product. And in some cases, the gap is actually shrinking quite dramatically. The US Department of Agriculture\u2019s Economic Research Service recently posted data on the price difference between organic and conventional options for 17 different types of food. On the low end, organic spinach costs just 7 percent more than conventional spinach (on average).",
        "Trump University didn\u2019t even pretend its goal was to offer students an education. Internal documents show that it was a scam, with the sole goal of getting its students to sign up for more classes. Documents released Tuesday night, which Donald Trump fought to keep secret, show how recruiters were instructed to upsell potential \u201dstudents\u201d to a $35, 000 mentorship, whether they could afford it or not.",
        "In the early 20th century, Tulsa, Oklahoma, was home to one of the wealthiest black neighborhoods in America \u2014 a neighborhood so that it earned the moniker \u201dBlack Wall Street.\u201d But in just a couple of days in 1921, a white mob bombed and burned down the community, brutally killing hundreds of black residents in the process. The attack, which happened 95 years ago on May 31 and June 1, 1921, is now known as the Tulsa race massacre of 1921.",

        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign apparently workshopped the idea of trying to tag Donald Trump with the nickname \u201dDangerous Donald.\u201d It was a bit of a lame idea. But in her foreign policy speech this afternoon, Clinton captured the essence of that critique well \u2014 and delivered her best version yet of an argument that we\u2019re going to hear more and more of as she puts the primary against Bernie Sanders behind her and looks ahead to the general election. The essence of the argument is simple.",
        "Social Security hasn\u2019t really been a major issue in Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. Insofar as it came up at all, it was in the context of Obama\u2019s attempts to reach a \u201dgrand bargain\u201d with congressional Republicans to reduce entitlement spending and increase taxes. His signature proposal there \u2014 a form of Social Security cut known as chained CPI \u2014 enraged the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. So it\u2019s startling to see him declare Wednesday that Social Security shouldn\u2019t be cut, but instead expanded. \u201dWe should be strengthening Social Security,\u201d he declared.",
        "Long before Frozen and Zootopia topped the box offices, filmmaker Lotte Reiniger \u2014 commemorated in today\u2019s Google Doodle \u2014 released the The Adventures of Prince Achmed in 1926, the first animated film. It was a version of The Arabian Nights; the feature tells the story of a young prince who foils the plans of an evil sorcerer and falls in love with a beautiful princess to the backdrop of an epic battle between good and bad. Even in 1926, it was a classic fairy tale \u2014 but one that marked a period of innovation in animated film.",
        "By far the best moment of Recode\u2019s annual Code Conference was when Elon Musk took the stage and explained that though we think we\u2019re participants in a physical world, we are almost certainly entities living inside a more advanced civilization\u2019s video game. Don\u2019t believe me? Here\u2019s Musk\u2019s argument in full: The strongest argument for us being in a simulation probably is the following. Forty years ago we had pong. Like, two rectangles and a dot. That was what games were.",
        "Growing up during the Great Recession of the late 2000s was rough for a lot of American kids: The only world they knew was a one, and the economic future looked grim. Now, it turns out the hard times may also have effects on their health, and their waistlines in particular.",
        "On Thursday night, violent protests broke out outside Donald Trump\u2019s rally in San Jose, California. Trump supporters reported being beaten up by protesters. Some supporters had bottles or eggs thrown at them, were chased, or were spit on. Photos show a group of protesters shaking a supporter\u2019s car. This is not the first time this has happened. Trump\u2019s rallies in California have been marked by disruptive and sometimes violent protests.",

        "At the beginning of time, all the matter in the universe was compressed into an infinitesimally small point. That tiny speck of everything then exploded and formed the universe. In some sense, it\u2019s still exploding, expanding at an accelerating rate. In the past, scientists have looked to the radiation left behind from the Big Bang \u2014 its smoking gun \u2014 to calculate what the rate of the expanding universe ought to be today. But new evidence, soon to be published in The Astrophysical Journal, suggests these estimates may be wrong, or at least incomplete."
