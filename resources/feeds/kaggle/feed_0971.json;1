        "Donald Trump, the actual Republican candidate for president, now endorsed by his party leaders, openly said he wants to exclude someone from a government job because of his race and ethnicity. As the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, Trump said he wants to disqualify the federal judge overseeing the Trump University case because of his \u201dMexican heritage\u201d and membership in a Latino lawyers association: Mr. Trump said U. S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel had \u201dan absolute conflict\u201d in presiding over the litigation given that he was \u201dof Mexican heritage\u201d and a member of a Latino lawyers\u2019 association. Mr.",
        "The US economy created 38, 000 jobs in May, the slowest pace of job growth in five years, according to disappointing statistics released today by the Labor Department. It\u2019s an ominous sign for the US economy \u2014 and for Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances of beating Donald Trump in the November election. The US economy needs to add about 150, 000 jobs a month to keep up with population growth. In the past couple of years, the economy has been doing a bit better than that, adding 200, 000 jobs in a typical month.",
        "Every week throughout season six, a handful of Vox\u2019s writers will discuss the latest episode of Game of Thrones. Before you dig in, check out our recap of Sunday\u2019s episode, as well the archive of our entire discussion to date. Next up this week is executive editor Matt Yglesias. Matt Yglesias: I have a different complaint about Dany\u2019s rousing speech to the Dothraki than what Todd and Andrew have raised: Why are the Dothraki cheering? What are they being promised that sounds so appealing?",
        "President Barack Obama delivered a commencement address at the Air Force Academy on Thursday \u2014 not really an occasion for a big partisan political speech. But he did briefly offer a defense of his decision not to intervene more forcefully in the Syrian civil war, an aspect of his presidency that\u2019s met with the least approval from the bipartisan foreign policy establishment and an area where his thinking is likely somewhat different from Hillary Clinton\u2019s.",
        "There\u2019s an inexplicable, deliberate sadness to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows. I\u2019m not just saying that because the Turtles earnestly root for the New York Knicks, whose combined record since the 2014 reboot of the franchise is a sad . Rating 1. 5 I\u2019m not just saying that because Academy Award nominee Laura Linney not only appears in the movie but has to mutter the phrase, \u201dWell played.\u201d Or because Tyler Perry shows up to cosplay as an evil version of Neil deGrasse Tyson. No, I\u2019m saying that because the Turtles seem a bit depressed.",
        "I have a relationship with the sort of thought experiments that Ezra Klein describes Elon Musk indulging in at the Recode Code Conference last year. They are part of what drew me to philosophy (I got a master\u2019s) and part of what pushed me away (I bailed before my PhD). That was all many, many years ago, and I haven\u2019t followed debates in academic philosophy closely since then. Still, what boss man wants, boss man gets. I am excited for some hot takes. This is the debate America needs.",
        "Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping just might be the dumbest movie of the summer \u2014 which, in spite of how it sounds, is an absolute compliment. From the punch drunk minds of the Lonely Island \u2014 the comedy trio made up of Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, and Akiva Schaffer \u2014 Popstar brings a giddy jolt of earnest enthusiasm to the mockumentary genre, even as it gleefully tears celebrity culture a new one. Rating 3.",
        "Since Donald Trump locked up the GOP presidential nomination, resistance to his candidacy from the party\u2019s elites has crumbled remarkably quickly. And the latest domino fell Thursday afternoon, as House Speaker Paul Ryan finally made clear in an and a tweet that he supported Trump\u2019s candidacy and planned to vote for him. I\u2019ll be voting for @realDonaldTrump this fall. I\u2019m confident he will help turn the House GOP\u2019s agenda into laws. https: .",
        "Recently my colleague Liz Scheltens argued that the standard electoral map we see every four years is pretty useless. The problem, she says, is that the maps you typically see favor geographical accuracy over electoral importance. Scheltens proposes alternative solutions, like a list of states with bar charts or a cartogram, which is a kind of map that distorts geographical areas based on some variable.",
        "In April, the internet seemed to abruptly discover a trend that had been lurking in its midst for years: Brutalism, an aesthetic borrowed from architecture and applied to minimally designed, websites. After Hacker News \u2014 itself arguably a Brutalist website \u2014 discovered a Brutalist website devoted to other Brutalist websites, discussion surrounding the trend caught on and spread. But what is a Brutalist website? That question is easier asked than answered.",
        "If you read Twitter recently, you\u2019ll have noted that a wide range of figures have changed their Twitter names to incorporate a series of parenthesis. The Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg, for example, is now (((goldberg))) and we\u2019ve also got Center for American Progress president (((Neera Tanden))) and Politico finance writer (((Ben White))). Even the internet satire account formerly known as Fake Jeff Jarvis has gotten in on the game, referring to itself as Prof. (((tronc))) combining the parenthesis fad with a joke about the publisher of the Chicago Tribune and the LA Times renaming itself tronc.",
        "Home 3D printing was supposed to be the next big thing. \u201dYou\u2019ve heard of 3D printers, but you probably don\u2019t own one yet,\u201d wrote Wired editor Chris Anderson in 2012. Anderson was profiling MakerBot, a company looking to bring a 3D printer into everyone\u2019s home. He compared MakerBot\u2019s new $2, 200 gadget to the PCs of the 1970s. A 3D printer lets you transform a 3D model of a digital object \u2014 say, a model of the Colosseum, a whistle, or an elaborate marble machine \u2014 into a physical object.",
        "Former Stanford University student Brock Turner, 20, was convicted in March of three counts of felony sexual assault. He faced a maximum of 14 years in prison \u2014 but he was sentenced to just six months in jail, plus probation.",
        "On Sunday, Switzerland became the first nation to hold a referendum on the idea of a basic income. Under the proposal, the Swiss constitution would\u2019ve been amended to \u201densure the introduction of an unconditional basic income,\u201d which \u201dshall enable the whole population to live in human dignity and participate in public life.\u201d The measure, however, was soundly defeated. Early results suggest that only about 22 percent voted yes, a landslide defeat. That might be attributable, in part, to the huge size of the basic income proposed by activists in the country.",
        "It seems like such an elegant solution. Millions of Americans (disproportionately black) have criminal records; people with criminal records have trouble getting hired for jobs, no matter how old, minor, or irrelevant the crime. So if you prevent employers from asking job applicants whether they have a criminal record \u2014 a policy known as \u201dban the box\u201d \u2014 you eliminate the bias, right? That\u2019s the logic that\u2019s led dozens of cities, a handful of states, and the federal government to enact policies.",
        "One million down, another billion or so to go. In a new report, the International Energy Agency estimates that 1. 26 million electric cars hit the world\u2019s roads in 2015, passing a nifty (if symbolic) milestone. Here\u2019s a chart showing the very rapid growth of both battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and hybrids (PHEV): The United States now has 400, 000 electric vehicles on the road \u2014 a massive increase since 2010, though well short of Obama\u2019s goal of 1 million by 2015. Meanwhile, China has become the world\u2019s largest market, overtaking the US in annual sales last year.",
        "Boxing legend and humanitarian Muhammad Ali died on Friday at the age of 74. Though the cause of death was respiratory complications, Ali had battled Parkinson\u2019s since 1984, when, three years after his retirement, he was diagnosed with the disease and became one of the world\u2019s most famous people to battle it. Parkinson\u2019s is a chronic, progressive disorder of the nervous system, and it\u2019s typically discovered with the onset of symptoms that include hand tremors and body stiffness. When Ali was diagnosed, the disease was very poorly understood.",
        "Black Lives Matter activist Jasmine \u201dAbdullah\u201d Richards was released from jail Saturday, less than two weeks after she was sentenced to in jail minus times served for a controversial felony conviction.",
        "Today, Hillary Clinton became the first woman to accept a major party\u2019s nomination for president of the United States. It\u2019s a historic occasion, but one that thus far has not generated the level of enthusiasm for Clinton\u2019s candidacy \u2014 particularly among younger women \u2014 that the campaign has hoped for.",
        "Eid the holiday marking the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, begins Saturday evening, and most of the world\u2019s 1. 6 billion Muslims will be observing it. This means there\u2019s a good chance you might encounter someone \u2014 a friend, a the barista making your latte at Starbucks, your child\u2019s teacher \u2014 who is celebrating. But what is Ramadan, exactly? And how can I make sure I don\u2019t accidentally offend my Muslim friends and acquaintances during Ramadan celebrations? We\u2019ve got you covered: Here are the most basic answers to the most basic questions about Ramadan.",
        "Waking up in the middle of the night to discover one of your arms has lost all feeling is frightening. At first, the limb is limp and flops around like a useless bag of bone before coming back to life with a flood of \u201dpins and needles\u201d sensations. When this happened to me as a kid, I panicked, thinking I\u2019d done something horrible to my body, anxious that I\u2019d never be able to move my arm again. But the feeling in my arm always came back.",
        "The seventh episode of most seasons of Game of Thrones gives the writers a chance to take a breather and make sure everything is in place for the final push toward the finale. Since the show is so driven by big moments, these episodes can feel a little uneventful, but they\u2019re often my favorites for the way they fill in little corners of the show\u2019s world. \u201dThe Broken Man\u201d doesn\u2019t quite reach that level. For one thing, the cliffhanger it foists upon Arya is patently ridiculous.",
        "When Brock Allen Turner, a former Stanford University student, was found guilty of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman, the verdict seemed to address a broader problem at Stanford and campuses across the country: the leniency accused sexual abusers are afforded while the lives of victims are turned upside down. In June, Turner was sentenced to six months in county jail and three years\u2019 probation. He only served three months of his sentence.",
        "Consider two key facts about coal in the United States: First, coal mining and burning is still a major contributor to global warming, responsible for about 25 percent of America\u2019s overall greenhouse gas emissions. Second, the coal industry is shrinking rapidly, getting crushed by both new air pollution regulations and competition from cheap natural gas and renewables. Back in 2008, coal provided fully half the country\u2019s electricity. Today it provides just . And that\u2019s expected to keep shrinking as we tackle climate change. Bad news for coal miners.",
        "A wide grin spread across Bernie Sanders\u2019s face as he looked out at a massive crowd of more than 20, 000 supporters in Oakland, California, in May. \u201dWhen we began this campaign a little over a year ago, the pundits had determined in their wisdom that this was going to be a \u2019fringe\u2019 campaign,\u201d Sanders said, his tone dripping with irony. \u201dA year has come and gone, and up until now we have won the primaries and caucuses in 23 states. We have won over 9 million votes . ..",
        "American women are facing poorer health prospects on several fronts these days. The latest study, published today in JAMA, looked at national trends in obesity and found a disturbing rise among adult women over the most recent decade, from 2005 to 2014. Meanwhile, the authors found that obesity rates among men had plateaued. By 2014, that meant that 40 percent of women were obese, while 35 percent of men were. For morbid obesity (a body mass index of 40 or greater) the rates for women compared with men were even more startling: 5.",
        "Loneliness is epidemic, and in the coming years it could explode. Forty percent of people age 65 and older report being lonely at times. And the percentage of people living alone has been rising steadily since the 1960s. Look at this GIF of how America will age until 2050. It\u2019s a wave of increasing old age, but it may also represent a wave of loneliness as baby boomers age into their 70s. Humans are social creatures; our entire psychology is built on coexisting with each other.",
        "Every Sunday, we pick a new episode of the week. It could be good. It could be bad. It will always be interesting. You can read the archives here. The episode of the week for May 29 through June 4, 2016, is the first installment of the History Channel\u2019s new version of Roots. When the History Channel announced it was remaking Roots, the initial response was the same as when any beloved cultural work is remade: Is this really necessary? It\u2019s easy to see why this is often the reaction when remakes are announced.",
        "I was fortunate to grow up in a union household. I know how important they are for families and communities. I know the power unions have to organize politically on behalf of important causes. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so significant that the one of the largest unions in the country, has partnered with my organization #FREEAMERICA to end the harmful, immoral, and unjust cycle of mass incarceration in the United States. I don\u2019t take it lightly that members have decided to organize to end mass incarceration.",
        "Electricity is an amazingly useful form of energy. Even better, we know how to generate it without carbon emissions. So step one in the battle to limit climate change is to shift as many energy services as possible over to electricity. However, some uses of energy are not easy to electrify in the short term, maybe even in the long term. They rely on liquid fuels. So if we\u2019re ever going to get to net zero emissions, we badly need liquid fuels that can substitute directly for fossil fuels in those areas that can\u2019t be electrified."
