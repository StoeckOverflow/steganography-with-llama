        "Hillary Clinton might have clinched the Democratic nomination last night, but six states are still going to the polls in the last big voting day for presidential primaries and caucuses. The big prize tonight is California, where Clinton is maintaining a narrow lead over challenger Bernie Sanders. So far, Clinton has won New Jersey, South Dakota, and New Mexico. Sanders has won North Dakota and Montana. The presidential primaries don\u2019t wrap up until next week, when the District of Columbia votes. And congressional primaries continue throughout the summer.",
        "Over the last 80 years, Louisiana has lost nearly 2, 000 square miles of coastland \u2014 land that has simply vanished into the Gulf of Mexico. And much, much more land is likely to disappear in the years ahead unless major changes are made. That\u2019s the subject of a terrific 2014 investigation from Bob Marshall of The Lens and Brian Jacobs and Al Shaw of ProPublica.",
        "Bernie Sanders launched a presidential campaign, drastically overperformed expectations, fell insurmountably far behind in the delegate race, and then decided he wanted to stay in it all the way until the end so his supporters in every state had a chance to vote. Traditional insurgent campaigns haven\u2019t done that, but Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign in 2008 did, and Sanders\u2019s success meant that he had the cash he needed to run a full campaign through California. And good for him.",
        "The final significant day of presidential primary voting has come to a close, and Hillary Clinton is now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. While the exact vote totals in a few states, especially California, were still being counted at press time, preliminary totals make it clear that Clinton will end up with more total delegates, more pledged delegates, and more total votes nationwide than Bernie Sanders \u2014 making her the winner of the race by every traditional metric.",
        "Philadelphia\u2019s City Council approved 1. 5 cent levy per ounce of both sugary and diet drinks on Thursday, an approach could be a model for other mayors across the US who have been trying to push through similar measures for years. From attack ads to protests to disgruntled Teamsters, the tax was the subject of fierce lobbying and debate in the City of Brotherly Love. Mayor Jim Kenney initially proposed a tax on each ounce of soda, iced tea, and other sugary drinks in March.",
        "Sexual assault is a huge problem in the US military. And for many victims, the process of reporting their crime and seeking justice can be as traumatic as their assault. Most members of Congress and military officials agree that these basic facts are true, and that more reforms to the military justice system could help. But there\u2019s a profound disagreement on how, and how much, the system needs to change. The US Senate is expected to vote this week on the Military Justice Improvement Act (MJIA).",
        "It\u2019s over. It\u2019s really, finally over. More than a year after candidates first started jumping into the race, and five months after voting began, the presidential primary season has concluded with six races in California, New Jersey, New Mexico, Montana, South Dakota, and North Dakota. With Donald Trump having sewn up the GOP nomination in early May, only the Democratic side really mattered on Tuesday.",
        "What would it be like if a black, Hispanic, Muslim, or woman candidate for president said the bigoted things Donald Trump has been saying \u2014 except focused such comments on white men? It\u2019s a useful thought experiment \u2014 one that shows the extremism of Trump\u2019s views, as well as the white, male privilege that permits him to espouse them as a candidate for president. Take the latest Trump controversy: his treatment of women. Seven women have now come out against Trump, claiming that he forcibly kissed or groped them.",
        "It\u2019s a fact that black workers in America earn less than white workers. It\u2019s a gap that has been explained by systemic discrimination and differences in education and employment expectations. But as far as professionals go, doctors inhabit a somewhat unique space. The path to becoming a doctor in the US is very tightly regulated. Doctors all have to be educated in a similar way, pass the same board exams, and earn the same licenses at the end.",
        "One of the dangers of expressing opinions on the internet for a living is that you sometimes express opinions that turn out to be totally incorrect. After I published a piece about the failure of home 3D printing on Monday, the American Conservative\u2019s Robert VerBruggen reminded me that I had a very different perspective on the topic four years ago: @RAVerBruggen People in 1975 couldn\u2019t think of many programs they\u2019d want to run on a personal computer. \u2014 Timothy B. Lee (@binarybits) September 21, 2012 @RAVerBruggen I think you\u2019re underestimating hindsight bias.",
        "Babies\u2019 cuteness is a powerful force to be reckoned with. It melts adult hearts, ensuring babies a steady source of food and protection until they mature to an age when they\u2019re slightly less vulnerable. What is it about babies that makes them so cute? It\u2019s their eyes, which are huge relative to their faces (eyeballs don\u2019t grow all that much after birth); their heads, which are too big for their bodies; their cheeks; and their tiny chins that get adults to fixate on them. Scientists say these traits activate an instinctual attention in adults.",
        "For the first time this year, colleges are required to publicly disclose the number of rapes, broken out from sexual assaults, reported on their campuses. That means it\u2019s possible to create a list of the most colleges in the US. And of course, because there has never been a ranked list of colleges on the internet that people won\u2019t click on, that\u2019s exactly what is happening. This is a terrible idea. Shaming colleges for a high number of rape reports, and implying that those with very few look good in comparison, isn\u2019t just wrongheaded.",
        "Last week, a judge sentenced Brock Turner, a former Stanford student, to six months in jail for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman behind a dumpster. The case went viral after the victim spoke out in a forceful letter read in court. Now another letter has surfaced. But this one, from a friend of Turner\u2019s to the judge, isn\u2019t speaking out against his light sentence. Instead, it\u2019s arguing that it wasn\u2019t Turner\u2019s decision to rape a human being that sent him to prison \u2014 but political correctness.",
        "It\u2019s amazing to go back and watch Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign announcement. Nearly everything about Sanders\u2019s campaign would change over the following 14 months \u2014 except for the candidate himself. There are no introductions. Sanders begins by pulling a crumpled piece of paper out of his pocket, before turning to a small scattering of reporters gathered around a makeshift podium. There\u2019s not a single Sanders supporter in sight \u2014 no banners, no \u201dBernie Tees\u201d or \u201dFeel the Bern\u201d pins or even as much as a cardboard sign.",
        "Brock Turner is a convicted sex offender. He was found guilty on three counts of sexual assault for digitally penetrating an unconscious woman behind a dumpster on the Stanford campus. Yet in a written statement to the judge in his case, Turner placed the blame for his assault on \u201ddrinking,\u201d the college \u201dparty culture,\u201d and his desire to \u201dfit in.\u201d Turner\u2019s case gained national attention after a powerful letter from his victim about the attack went viral.",
        "Every year, the Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century \u2014 mercifully abbreviated as REN21 \u2014 puts out a massive Global Status Report on renewable energy. It is an energy nerd\u2019s dream, packed with the latest data on clean energy around the world. When such reports are released, we here at Vox are legally obligated to do a charts post, lest we be fined by the Explainer Authorities. So let\u2019s get to it. One of the more interesting themes this year is just how clearly China is pushing the developing world into the lead on renewables.",
        "How many times can I say, \u201dThe Americans is the best show on television\u201d? One more? Okay. It\u2019s the best show on television, and even given the mighty standards it\u2019s set for itself, it just finished what may have been its best run of episodes yet. Season four combined the clockwork storytelling of The Americans\u2019 third season with the more emphasis of its second to tell a story about love, loss, and biological weapons. It\u2019s as close to a perfect season of television as I\u2019ve seen since Mad Men\u2019s fifth. And it doesn\u2019t have to be the last!",

Vox Sentences is written by Dylan Matthews and Dara Lind.

        "Most of the headlines from Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s speech at the American Constitution Society on Thursday were, understandably, about her attacks on Donald Trump. \u201dElizabeth Warren labels Donald Trump \u2018nasty, fraud\u2019 in speech,\u201d wrote the Boston Globe. \u201dElizabeth Warren Amps Up Her Onslaught on Donald Trump,\u201d said Mother Jones.

        "Few companies have enjoyed more hype over the past few years than electric carmaker Tesla. And not without reason: Tesla is the most successful automaking startup in decades and has almost singlehandedly made electric cars cool. Yet the automaker has also been struggling with the quality of its vehicles. On Thursday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration revealed it was investigating a possible problem with the suspension of Tesla\u2019s flagship Model S sedans. The reported flaw is the latest in a series of quality and reliability problems with Tesla\u2019s vehicles.",
        "Imagine if we programmed the mosquitoes that carry malaria to . Not just a few of them. All of them. Every last bloodsucker on the planet. That\u2019s no longer an outlandish fantasy. With a powerful new genetic editing tool known as a \u201dgene drive,\u201d scientists could, in theory, transform entire species. I\u2019ll explain the mechanics below, but the basic idea is that scientists would alter the DNA of a few individual organisms and use gene drives to spread the modification throughout an entire population \u2014 by tweaking the rules of genetic inheritance.",
        "Bernie Sanders may have lost the current battle for the Democratic nomination. But he\u2019s winning the war for the party\u2019s future. That, at least, is the conventional wisdom about Sanders\u2019s campaign \u2014 that while the Vermont senator may go down to defeat in this presidential cycle, his young supporters can expect sweeping victory within a generation or two. US News, for instance, declares that \u201dThe Future is Bernie\u2019s.\u201d Sanders himself certainly thinks so. Vox\u2019s Matt Yglesias has argued that Sanders\u2019s \u201dbrand of politics is the future of the Democratic Party,\u201d citing his runaway support among young voters.",
        "One of the many astounding things that humans can do is recognize faces. Even though most faces we encounter are basically similar \u2014 a rough oval shape, two eyes, a nose, a mouth \u2014 most of us can pick out subtle differences and distinguish among hundreds of mugs. In an instant. Monkeys and other primates are similarly adept. For a long time, scientists thought this feat required sophisticated brain machinery \u2014 a combination of perception and memory. Brain scans show that a part of our neocortex known as the fusiform gyrus becomes activated when we look at faces.",

        "Indonesia has a ruthless strategy for dealing with pirates: blow up their boats. Over the past two years, the Indonesian Navy has seized more than 100 vessels flagged from Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines \u2014 all accused of fishing illegally in Indonesian waters. Whenever this happens, authorities detain the crew, load the empty boat with explosives, and let it burn as a warning to others: Except it doesn\u2019t work. Or at least it\u2019s not nearly enough. There are always more boats, more desperate fishermen looking for work.",
