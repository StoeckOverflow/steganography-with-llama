        "Washington, DC, has done something remarkable: published a granular, map of the city\u2019s lead pipes. The data, released earlier this week, shows that at least 12, 000 buildings (primarily private residences) rely on public lead pipes for water service. It\u2019s one of the most detailed and transparent looks at where lead pipes \u2014 which can contaminate water, causing a host of health issues \u2014 exist in a major urban area. The data set (which is available as an interactive map here) covers 125, 390 water service lines in the city.",
        "Bill Cosby\u2019s lawyers are trying to get the sexual assault charges against their client dropped, or at least order a new preliminary hearing, by claiming that they should have been allowed to the woman who alleges Cosby assaulted her. Brian McMonagle, Cosby\u2019s lead defense lawyer, argued in documents filed Wednesday that it was \u201chearsay\u201d to admit testimony from the detectives who took statements in 2005 from Andrea Constand about the alleged assault. This is the same argument that McMonagle tried to make at Cosby\u2019s pretrial hearing on May 24.",
        "It\u2019s an question: If you had to choose between more time and more money, what would it be? Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and University of California Los Angeles wanted to find out in a study they published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science. Here\u2019s what they found: People who value time over money are happier The scientists ran several studies \u2014 online surveys, surveys, nationally representative surveys of more than 4, 000 people \u2014 asking the same basic question: What would you rather have, more time or more money?",
        "The critical consensus has spoken when it comes to Warcraft, the new fantasy epic adapted from the video game series, and it is dire. With Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic scores circling the drain, it would seem the film is the bust of the summer, a massively overpriced stinker that nobody really wanted (except for China, where the film is setting box office records). Takes big step back from microphone. Whispers. I kinda liked it. Rating 3. 5 Yes, it\u2019s a mess. Most of it feels adapted from a Wikipedia page.",
        "Good news for lovers of Swiss rolls, soggy bottoms, and British baking: The Great British Baking Show is coming back to PBS for a third season, beginning July 1. Its timing couldn\u2019t be better. The Great British Baking Show could have been as an antidote for the summer of 2016.",
        "O. J.: Made in America might be the most essential TV series of the year. Rating 5 The ESPN documentary is a rich, dense examination of more than 50 years of American culture, one that uses the O. J. Simpson murder trial as a way to look at race and gender and class. If that sounds a little like The People vs. O. J. Simpson, FX\u2019s dynamite fictional miniseries about the trial from earlier in the year, well, that\u2019s unavoidable.",
        "The first step to fixing a problem is acknowledging it exists. And in the latest episode of MTV\u2019s Decoded, host Franchesca Ramsey breaks down exactly why being colorblind to someone\u2019s race not only doesn\u2019t fix racism but, if anything, she says, actually makes matters worse. \u201dHave you ever wondered why people say, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t see color\u2019 as a way to fix racism?\u201d Ramsey asks. \u201dYeah, that doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Sure, race is not biologically real. But Ramsey points out that resting on that argument alone is part of the problem.",

        "Warning: Major spoilers follow for the books Game of Thrones is based on \u2014 and thus maybe Game of Thrones itself. Fans started whispering almost immediately after the Red Wedding capped Game of Thrones\u2019 third season. When is Lady Stoneheart coming? When the character didn\u2019t make an appearance in the season three finale, it seemed safe to assume she would turn up at the end of season four. After all, A Storm of Swords, the third book in George R. R. Martin\u2019s A Song of Ice and Fire series of novels, was adapted into two seasons of television.",
        "Happy Saturday! For your reading pleasure, here is the best the web has to offer on books and related subjects for the week of June 6, 2016.

        "It\u2019s typical for large business enterprises to be financed in large part by people who didn\u2019t found the company and don\u2019t necessarily manage it. Consequently, while one way to make a lot of money founding and managing a company is for the company to be very successful, and thus for your share of it to be very valuable, that actually isn\u2019t the only way. Another thing you can do is run a business that stays afloat for a number of years without really being profitable.",
        "The 70th annual Tony Awards, honoring the best and brightest of Broadway for the \u201916 season, handed out 24 golden statuettes on Sunday. Actor, Late Late Show host, and former Tony winner James Corden hosted. The runaway hit Hamilton, a musical retelling of the life of founding father Alexander Hamilton, won big, as expected. With 16 nominations in 13 categories, it took home 11 Tonys, including Best Musical, leaving it just shy of The Producers\u2019 record for 12 Tonys in 2002.",
        "Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off premiered 30 years ago, on June 11, 1986. The movie, which director John Hughes wrote in a week, was a critical and commercial hit and became an enduring classic. But now that we\u2019ve had three decades to get used to the idea, let\u2019s admit it: Ferris is the actual worst. Don\u2019t get me wrong; I love this movie. It\u2019s terrifically fun, both in its own right and from a nostalgia perspective, and I\u2019m all for standing up to the man, defying the system, etc. But the evidence of Ferris\u2019s terribleness just can\u2019t be denied.",
        "\u201dIt\u2019s like the Oscars if they were actually diverse,\u201d James Corden said at the opening of the 70th Annual Tony Awards. While the Tonys are usually almost as #SoWhite as the Oscars, 2016 proved to be a year of exceptional diversity, driven in part by Hamilton, whose cast is almost entirely made up of people of color. Thus, it was only right that Hamilton\u2019s featured performance include the line that stops the show cold every night on Broadway, forcing the orchestra to vamp for three extra measures as the audience applauds: \u201dImmigrants.",
        "The point of a \u201dmajor foreign policy address\u201d is for a presidential candidate, who typically lacks foreign policy experience, to show that he or she is in the process of learning and capable of learning more in the future. Any president, after all, relies heavily on staff. It\u2019s no shame not to know everything, but you have to show that you know you don\u2019t know everything and are going to work with others to fill in the gaps. On this score, Donald Trump\u2019s speech this afternoon failed utterly.",
        "In one of the year\u2019s biggest technology deals, Microsoft is buying LinkedIn for $26 billion. If you\u2019re in a profession that makes heavy use of LinkedIn, this deal may make perfect sense to you. But if you\u2019re in a profession that doesn\u2019t use LinkedIn much, you might be surprised to learn that LinkedIn is not only still in business but is worth $26 billion. But this is no blunder. LinkedIn isn\u2019t a very cool company, but neither is Microsoft, and LinkedIn has a thriving business focused on helping professionals find jobs and companies find workers.",
        "Political insiders used to scoff at the idea that Hillary Clinton would choose Elizabeth Warren for her running mate. But multiple reports have found that she\u2019s one of the contenders on a shortlist that will soon be vetted by the Clinton team, alongside Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, and potentially others. And on Monday, Clinton and Warren will campaign together at an event in Cincinnati, in what could well be an audition for veep. Many Democratic elites seem to be thrilled about the idea of a ticket.",
        "Game of Thrones\u2019 sixth season has often seemed to oscillate between a plot that is barely moving and a plot that is hurtling downhill at an alarming pace. In the season\u2019s eighth episode, the series struck a balance. Things happened. A castle fell. An armada arrived. A queen traveled suspiciously quickly. Some significant legislation was passed. A cliffhanger was resolved, and a beloved character may finally get back in the game. But things still felt reasonably leisurely. We had time for Bronn to screw around with Pod.",
        "The first platform committee meeting for the 2016 Democratic National Convention, featuring representatives from both campaigns as well as DNC neutrals, took place on Wednesday. Their deliberations will likely feature tough negotiations on a range of issues \u2014 a $15 minimum wage, fracking, the legitimacy of giant banks \u2014 that were points of contention during the campaigning, helping clarify the political and ideological shift that has taken place in the party since the when Robert Rubin was its intellectual lodestar.",
        "Every few months, there\u2019s another story about the vexing issue of ethics in cars. Here\u2019s the latest, in Wired. The stories all pose the same basic questions: What sort of ethical choices will autonomous vehicles make, when forced to make them? More importantly, who decides? Is it up to the engineers who program the software? Does the public get a vote? Or will we let the cars themselves figure it out? I\u2019m a fan of that last option: Let the cars figure it out. That probably strikes you, at first blush, as creepy and slightly dystopian.",
        "Here\u2019s an important energy milestone: For the first time since 1979, America\u2019s cars, trucks, and airplanes emit more carbon dioxide than its power plants do. The chart below comes from Sam Ori, executive director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago: You can see the full data here. The story here is that the United States has made remarkable progress in greening its electricity sector since 2005. Whenever you see exciting headlines about renewable energy growth or the plunge in US emissions, those articles are usually talking about electricity.",

        "For some time, political observers have wondered \u2014 or feared \u2014 whether a major terror attack on American soil could sweep Donald Trump into the White House. The topic came up after the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando back in June. And in the wake of a new series of bombings and attempted bombings in New York City and New Jersey, and a stabbing attack in Minnesota, the question of what effect terror could have on the presidential campaign once again seems urgent. Both candidates have wasted little time speaking out on the matter.",
        "The Orlando nightclub shooter, Omar Mateen, reportedly called 911 and pledged his allegiance to ISIS and its leader, Abu Bakr at some point during Sunday\u2019s attack. Now once again we are asking ourselves how an average American could suddenly become capable of committing such a terrible act against his fellow countrymen. This threat is often shorthanded as \u201dradicalization.\u201d But how it happens, what drives it, and whom it can affect are all commonly misunderstood.",
        "With all the theatrics surrounding presidential politics, the rare media questions on health care tend to spotlight one issue: Are you for or against the Affordable Care Act? Left unasked is how to help the millions of Americans who suffer from chronic illnesses such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or stroke \u2014 which now make up an astounding 93 percent of Medicare spending. Chronic illness is a personal issue for me: It was a challenge for both of my parents. My father, an acclaimed journalist of historical nonfiction, suffered from heart disease.",
        "This Sunday marks the 15 year anniversary of September 11 \u2014 the worst terrorist attack on American soil. It was perpetrated by 20 men primarily from Saudi Arabia, and since then, fears of foreign terrorists have been understandably widespread. But not one domestic terrorist attack since has been committed by a foreign terrorist organization. Overall, terrorism in America is happening from homegrown radicals.",

        "One of the most respected and accurate forecasting models in political sciences says that Donald Trump will win the 2016 presidential election, and by a fairly comfortable margin at that. There\u2019s just one problem: Its creator doesn\u2019t believe his own forecast. Emory political scientist Alan Abramowitz\u2019s \u201dTime for Change\u201d makes predictions by considering how the economy is doing (measured by the GDP growth rate the second quarter of the election year) how popular the incumbent is (measured by his Gallup approval rating at the end of June) and whether the incumbent is running for reelection.",
        "The collapse of global crude oil prices in 2014 was easily one of the biggest energy stories on the planet. By early 2016, oil had slid to $33 per barrel, a level not seen since 2003. Gasoline was dirt cheap, SUVs were coming back in style, Venezuela was imploding, and the US fracking boom started fizzling. It was a really big deal. Over the last month, however, prices have started to creep back up again, rising to $50 per barrel on Monday.",
