        "Sometime during the attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, shooter Omar Mateen reportedly called 911 and pledged his allegiance to ISIS and its leader, Abu Bakr according to authorities. While it is possible that evidence will emerge showing that ISIS directly ordered or facilitated the attack on the popular gay nightclub, so far it has not.",
        "Gregory Rabassa, who died Tuesday, was a literary translator, specializing in English translations of Spanish and Portuguese original works. He is perhaps best known for his work with Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who called Rabassa\u2019s translation of One Hundred Years of Solitude better than the Spanish original. We spoke to him on the phone in 2014, after Marquez\u2019 death. The then Rabassa was still sharp, but his wife asked us to print out the interview and send it to him \u2014 he didn\u2019t use the internet.",
        "Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) is out with its annual New Energy Outlook for 2016, forecasting global energy trends through 2040, focusing this year on electricity. There\u2019s lots to dig through, but the big story is familiar: Progress is occurring more rapidly than almost anyone forecast \u2014 global fossil fuel electricity use is expected to peak in 2025 and decline thereafter \u2014 but not rapidly enough to forestall 2 degrees of global warming. We\u2019re going fast, but not fast enough. That said, there are lots of interesting nuances and substories in the report.",

TOP NEWS Who knows what evil lurks Omar Mateen Here, three days after the Orlando nightclub shooting, is what we actually know about the motives of Omar Mateen: We know that several Pulse regulars said they\u2019d seen him at the gay nightclub multiple times, and that others have claimed he had a profile on a gay dating app.",
        "This story starts 1. 4 billion years ago, in a corner of the universe, with a catastrophe. Two black holes \u2014 the densest, most destructive forces known to nature \u2014 collided with one another. Black holes are so massive that when they collide they disrupt the very fabric of space and time itself. And like a stone cast into still water, that disruption rippled outward, warping space and time as it grew, throughout the endless pond that is the universe. This past Christmas, that wave of gravity finally reached Earth.",
        "On September 21 and 22, Vox will hold its first conference. Or, as the case may be, its first . Our theory is this: There are already a lot of panel discussions about legislation in Washington. And this is, let\u2019s face it, a pretty depressing year in American politics. So what if we had some real conversations about the ideas that aren\u2019t going to happen this year but should shape our future? What if instead of talking about next year\u2019s appropriations, we talked about a universal basic income?",
        "In the early 1990s, with panic over the AIDS epidemic rising, hundreds of school districts began making condoms more accessible to students. The hope was to encourage students to practice safe sex and better protect themselves from sexually transmitted diseases. A new research paper suggests that decision may have backfired. It finds that access to condoms in school led to a 10 percent increase in teen births. The effects were concentrated in schools that offered condoms with no required counseling. Those schools also saw that gonorrhea rates for women rose following the condom programs.",
        "There are a few big things we know about gun violence in America: The US has way more guns per capita than any other country. It has far more gun homicides per capita than other wealthy countries. States with more guns have more gun deaths. And people with guns in their homes are more likely to be killed or to kill themselves with guns. But just as importantly, there\u2019s a lot that researchers still don\u2019t know. There\u2019s frustratingly little evidence on what policies work best to reduce gun violence.",
        "Something very odd happened to Donald Trump Tuesday night. He experienced a totally normal, totally banal American politics gaffe cycle in which he said something politically awkward but totally defensible and then wound up spinning away from it furiously. Specifically, speaking in North Carolina, Trump said that American soldiers in Iraq were passing out baskets full of money and implied that some of them stole that money and are now \u201cliving very well. \u201d This immediately prompted raised eyebrows on social media from Jeffrey Goldberg, John Harwood, and others.",
        "A World Health Organization panel of experts on cancer risks just declared that drinking coffee may protect against some cancers. But if the coffee is too hot, it actually slightly increases the risk of other cancers. The International Agency for Research on Cancer, an arm of the WHO, periodically makes declarations about the strength of evidence of a link between cancer and things like bacon, cellphones, or exposure to certain chemicals.",
        "Authorities are treating the two bombings in New York and New Jersey on Saturday as acts of terrorism. The first bombing, which injured no one, occurred near the starting line of a Marine Corps charity race in New Jersey; the second took place in Manhattan\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood and injured 29 people. The main suspect in both bombings is Ahmad Khan Rahami, a naturalized U. S. citizen of Afghan descent. Rahami is currently in surgery following a shootout with police on Monday.",
        "In the wake of mass shootings, many people wonder how they could have been prevented. Were there warning signs that should have been heeded? Was the person mentally ill? Did he or she hold extremist views? It\u2019s a question we\u2019re bound to ask on an awful day of two unrelated shooting events \u2014 the attack on Republican Congressmen and staff practicing baseball in Alexandria, Virginia, and a shooting at a UPS warehouse in San Fransisco. The sad truth is that the only personal factors that reliably correlate with mass shooters are being young and male.",
        "One of the problems with Muslims in America, according to Donald Trump, is that they simply don\u2019t fit in. Asked about the assimilation of Muslim immigrants in American culture on Fox News\u2019s Hannity Tuesday night, Trump said it is \u201dpretty close\u201d to \u201dnonexistent,\u201d even with and American citizens.",

        "Several years ago, at a clean energy conference, I saw a presentation by entrepreneur and venture capitalist Bill Gross, founder of the technology incubator IdeaLab. He was discussing eSolar, a company he helped found and of which he was, at the time (around 2010, if memory serves) CEO. In the course of his presentation, he said something that has stuck with me ever since.",
        "Some of the worst mass shootings, the ones that turn the names of American towns into a universal shorthand for tragedy, have all used similar guns: versions of the assault rifle.

        "Donald Trump believes the best way to prevent the mass shooting in Orlando is to go back in time and block shooter Omar Mateen\u2019s parents from coming to the United States. \u201dThe bottom line,\u201d Trump said in a major speech on Monday, \u201dis that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here.\u201d This was all, Trump continued, that could have been expected \u2014 once Muslim immigrants are admitted into the US, their descendants will inevitably become terrorists.",

        "Last week, in an effort to force legislative action on gun control, Sen. Chris Murphy staged a filibuster on the Senate floor. It lasted from 11 am, Wednesday, through 2 am the following morning, eventually ending with the GOP agreeing to vote on a gun control bill. As politicians recounted stories of gun violence before the Senate, there were 38 shootings that killed 12 people and injured 36 more across America. The shootings began as soon as Murphy took the floor, shortly after 11 am.",
        "Over the course of the Republican primary, Donald Trump made a series of inflammatory and bizarre statements, and in each case some pundits predicted the remarks would prove fatal to his campaign. In fact, those statements did nothing to dim his appeal to the plurality of Republicans who supported him. And they helped him continue to dominate media coverage in a way that made it difficult for anyone else to break through.",
        "Democratic Sen.

        "In the wake of the 49 murders at Orlando\u2019s gay nightclub Pulse, there\u2019s been a conversation on gun control in this country, or the lack of it. The ease of getting a gun in America is, at this point, terrifyingly entertaining. In the wake of Orlando\u2019s shooting massacre, a columnist in Philadelphia purchased an semiautomatic rifle, the gun used in some of America\u2019s deadliest mass shootings. She was able to buy it in seven minutes. Another writer, in Vermont, purchased the same gun model from a man in a Five Guys parking lot.",
        "In a classroom, teaching consent for sexual situations is often met with a lot of questioning raised hands: Doesn\u2019t interrupting every stage of a hookup kill the mood? How do you even bring it up? Isn\u2019t that awkward?",
        "At a Monday vigil in Salt Lake City for the victims of the Orlando shooting, Utah Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox gave a moving, tearful speech apologizing to the LGBTQ community for treating them poorly in his early life, and expressing gratitude to them for helping him realize the error of his ways.

        "Minor Finding Dory spoilers follow. Finding Nemo didn\u2019t need a sequel. Pixar\u2019s 2003 feature film about a lost clownfish and his paranoid dad wasn\u2019t just a technological feat of animation, set within a vivid world full of brightly hued coral reefs and expressive creatures swimming through undulating blue waters. It was also a gorgeous tale of family, loss, and discovery that seemed to have a clear ending, one that left no narrative threads hanging in its wake. But now, 13 years later, Finding Dory has arrived to insist that there\u2019s more to this story. And it\u2019s right. Rating 4.",
        "As with every mass shooting before it, politicians are responding to Sunday morning\u2019s massacre at the Pulse gay nightclub in Orlando by extending their \u201dthoughts and prayers\u201d to the families of the 49 victims who lost their lives.
