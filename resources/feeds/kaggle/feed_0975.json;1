        "Volkswagen has been in deep trouble this past year. Last fall, the German automaker was caught rigging more than 11 million of its \u201dclean diesel\u201d cars in the US and Europe so they polluted far less during testing than they did on the road. The scandal could ultimately cost the company $18 billion in recalls, repairs, and fines. So now VW is engaged in an image makeover. On Thursday, the company announced that it would go on the electric vehicle craze that\u2019s starting to sweep the globe.",
        "Conflict of interest in nutrition research is nothing new. Health food is a business, and the more virtuous the food, the better it sells. From walnut growers to grape juice producers, there are hundreds of examples of companies and industry groups funding independent studies that corroborate marketing claims about their product\u2019s ability to improve health and fight disease. Trouble is, consumers are almost always snookered by this shady science. The newest example is a study funded by Ocean Spray, the world\u2019s leading producer of cranberry juices.",
        "Thanks to a Maine trucking lawsuit, the Oxford comma is back in the news. The controversy? As the New York Times explains, a recent overtime lawsuit hinged on the interpretation of a state law \u2014 and whether it should be read as if it had an Oxford comma or not. Of course, including a comma would have made that clear from the beginning. It\u2019s the latest volley in one of those timeless internet arguments. But as the above video shows, the Oxford comma\u2019s usage isn\u2019t the most interesting part about it.",
        "Every week throughout season six, a handful of Vox\u2019s writers will discuss the latest episode of Game of Thrones. Before you dig in, check out our recap of Sunday\u2019s episode, as well the archive of our entire discussion to date. Next up this week is culture editor Todd VanDerWerff. Todd VanDerWerff: If there\u2019s one thing \u201dNo One\u201d underlined for me, it\u2019s that Game of Thrones is spoiling George R. R.

        "Nuclear power has been falling out of favor in Europe ever since the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. Italy has closed all its reactors. Germany, Belgium, and Switzerland are in the midst of retiring their fleets. Even France, which gets 77 percent of its electricity from nuclear, has been discussing a partial phaseout. Yet for a continent that prides itself on being a leader on global warming, shutting down a major source of reliable, electricity isn\u2019t always easy. And Sweden is a great case study here.",
        "Coming out of the woodwork, former President George W. Bush has decided to lend his support to vulnerable incumbents in the 2016 Senate election. The New York Times reports that in the coming weeks, Bush will be campaigning for Sens. Roy Blunt ( ) Ron Johnson ( ) and Rob Portman ( ). Since Trump became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Bush has also participated in fundraisers for Sens. Kelly Ayotte ( ) and John McCain ( ).",

        "Most presidential candidates, even if they\u2019re criticizing their opponents as weak on defense, don\u2019t actually predict future attacks on Americans. But then there\u2019s Donald Trump. Friday morning, in a laundry list of everything he finds wrong with the United States, the presumptive Republican nominee foreshadowed tragedy: \u201dMore attacks will follow Orlando,\u201d he tweeted.

        "Stephen Curry \u2014 the point guard for the Golden State Warriors \u2014 has been dubbed the \u201dgreatest shooter\u201d in the history of the NBA. Aside from his arsenal of records, he is also the free throw shooter of all time. In his career, he has made 1, 668 of 1, 850 attempts from the line \u2014 good for a 90. 2 percent success rate. That\u2019s pretty damn good. But it\u2019s not quite as good as a suspected terrorist\u2019s success rate buying a gun in America. Stick with us for a second.",

        "(No, seriously, don\u2019t read any further than this line if you don\u2019t want to spoil yourself on the end of Orange Is the New Black season four.) If you\u2019ve already made it through all 13 episodes of Orange Is the New Black\u2019s fourth season \u2014 which dropped on Netflix in its entirety on Friday, June 17 \u2014 chances are you need to process the shocking events of the penultimate episode, which featured one of the show\u2019s most tragic turns to date.

But there\u2019s a bright spot, folks! Actually, there are 15 of them, according to a new study published in Nature. A group of marine researchers has identified places where reef ecosystems are thriving despite environmental and human pressures. These \u201dbright spots\u201d are rays of hope for future conservation efforts, which may use them to apply better practices to less lucky places.

At the Cut, Laura June reads Karl Ove Knausgaard as a mommy blogger: Because he is so minutely observant, and because he has clearly spent so much time marveling over his own childhood, Knausgaard\u2019s attention to detail results in a high level of insight when it comes to his own children.",
        "Warning: This review contains spoilers for the entirety of Orange Is the New Black\u2019s fourth season. Orange Is the New Black\u2019s theme song is a powerful and insistent earworm.

        "Originally published on Grist. Imagine a world in which resources are so scarce that the government decides all grain must go to people rather than to animals. Without animal feed, steak exists only as a memory, and eggs become contraband. What would happen then? This isn\u2019t a thought experiment ripped from the darkest nightmares of conservatives: It\u2019s history. During World War I, when Allied forces cut off supply routes to Denmark, the government essentially outlawed meat. Danes slaughtered their pigs so that people could eat the grain that otherwise fed the animals.",
        "The summer solstice is upon us: June 20th and the 21st will be the longest days of 2017 for anyone living north of the equator. If pagan rituals are your thing, this is probably a big moment for you. If not, the solstice is still pretty neat. Technically speaking, the summer solstice occurs when the sun is directly overhead the Tropic of Cancer, or 23. 5\u00b0 north latitude. In 2017, this will occur at exactly 12:24 am (Eastern) on the 21st.",
        "Humans have been building and living in cities for thousands of years. But only very recently \u2014 in the past few years \u2014 did the scales tip to more of us choosing to settle in cities than in rural areas.

        "\u201dBattle of the Bastards\u201d is big in the way that only Game of Thrones is big. It\u2019s less epic in its scope than, say, season four\u2019s battle between the Night\u2019s Watch and Wildlings, \u201dThe Watchers on the Wall\u201d (an episode I\u2019ve always found a touch overbearing) but compare it to season two\u2019s \u201dBlackwater\u201d (featuring the battle for King\u2019s Landing) and it\u2019s easy to see just how much the show\u2019s scope has increased.",
        "Today the Senate failed to pass gun control legislation yet again \u2014 despite four proposed amendments and even the National Rifle Association publicly supporting one of the amendments. It\u2019s become an and devastating pattern: first, a tragic mass shooting with countless lives lost, then an impassioned call for gun reform, and finally, a failure to compromise and pass gun control legislation in Congress. Congress failed to pass gun control legislation after the shooting in San Bernardino that killed 14 and wounded 21 more last December.",
        "Donald Trump has fired his manager Corey Lewandowski. I say \u201d manager\u201d because Donald Trump barely has any campaign to manage. The Associated Press recently reported that Trump only has about 30 paid staffers. There are Senate candidates running more expansive operations.

        "Tonight, Senate Democrats made good on a commitment they had little leverage until now to follow through on: a promise to take votes on gun control bills. They still didn\u2019t have the leverage, however, to pass them. After the worst mass shooting in modern American history, a Senate Democratic filibuster led by Sen. Chris Murphy ( ) shamed Republicans into scheduling votes for Monday.",
        "Gun control votes can often send Democrats running scared and divided, but today they stand united in the face of a strategic \u2014 if not legislative \u2014 win. Early this evening, the Senate will go on the record on a measure instituting universal background checks for gun buyers and another measure allowing the FBI to veto gun purchases by people under investigation for ties to terrorism. Related Here are the 4 gun control proposals the Senate is voting on today Connecticut Sen.",
        "The Democratic push on gun control on Monday has at least one Republican open to bipartisanship: Sen. Kelly Ayotte. Late Monday afternoon, Ayotte \u2014 a moderate who represents the purple state of New Hampshire \u2014 announced on the Senate floor that she\u2019ll be supporting the Democratic caucus\u2019s plan to bar those investigated as terrorists from purchasing firearms.

        "This week the United Kingdom will vote whether or not to stay in the European Union.

Most financial institutions say Britain\u2019s exit could threaten the entirety of the global economy.",
        "Senate Democrats managed to force the Republican majority to agree to take a vote on gun control after a filibuster Wednesday night. But the real future of gun control in America likely rests not with Congress but with the Supreme Court. At least two cases on gun control, one challenging Maryland\u2019s state ban on assault weapons and another arguing that DC\u2019s requirements for issuing concealed carry licenses are too strict, could reach the high court soon. And so these crucial questions, like so many others, depend on the outcome of the presidential election.",

        "On Thursday, Jo Cox, a rising star in British Parliament, was gunned down on the streets of her constituency in Yorkshire, in the north of England. Cox was a vibrant young mother of two and former aid worker who was fiercely passionate about politics and justice. She was particularly active on Syrian refugee issues. I testified in front of the parliamentary committee she chaired on Syria in January. She seemed driven to action by the horrors of that war but refreshingly aware that outrage is not a strategy.",
        "The global community has reached a devastating new milestone. According to a report released by the United Nation\u2019s refugee agency this morning, the number of people displaced by conflict at the end of 2015 was the highest ever \u2014 even greater than the refugee crisis that followed the Second World War. By the end of 2015, some 65. 3 million people were forcibly displaced from their homes globally. In that year alone, an estimated 12. 4 million people were newly displaced, according to the report."
