        "A new poll puts presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton ahead of \u2014 or neck and neck with \u2014 Republican Donald Trump in several key swing states. The poll, conducted by Quinnipiac University, gives Clinton an 8 percentage point lead over Trump in Florida ( ) as well as a tie in Ohio ( ) and a minor lead in Pennsylvania ( ). The Ohio and Pennsylvania results are both within the margin of error. RealClearPolitics, which aggregates findings from multiple surveys, puts Clinton at a lead of 2. 7 points in Ohio and a lead of 0.",
        "The US drone killing of Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansour in Baluchistan, Pakistan, in May 2016 was a significant break with US policy: For the first time, the United States struck a top Taliban leader enjoying shelter and a comfortable life in core parts of Pakistan. The hope is that in the long term, taking out the leadership will cause the Taliban to fragment, weakening its capacity to sustain an insurgency and ultimately motivating it to negotiate a peace settlement with the Afghan government.",
        "Elon Musk wants to merge Tesla and SolarCity into a single \u201d \u201d clean energy company that would handle everything from solar power to batteries to electric cars. He calls it a \u201dblindingly obvious\u201d move. But plenty of investors are far more skeptical. The backstory: On Tuesday evening, Musk\u2019s Tesla Motors made an offer to buy SolarCity \u2014 the big solar installer he also founded \u2014 in a $2. 8 billion deal.",
        "On Monday, the Senate didn\u2019t just hand a defeat to gun control supporters. It handed a defeat to its own party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee. Donald Trump supports prohibiting suspected terrorists from buying guns. He even tried to flex some muscle last week to get the National Rifle Association on board. (After all, Trump pointed out, the NRA has endorsed him \u2014 and if his treatment of Chris Christie is any indication, he sees endorsement as something like indentured servitude.) But the NRA didn\u2019t budge, and so neither did the GOP. Sen.",
        "Opponents of abortion often challenge people with thought experiments about very late abortions. Rand Paul challenged Debbie Wasserman Schultz to affirm that she would be okay with \u201dkilling a baby that is not born yet.\u201d Marco Rubio falsely claimed that Hillary Clinton even supports abortion \u201don the due date.\u201d It\u2019s easy for later abortions to be reduced to thought experiments \u2014 to be demonized and caricatured as something they\u2019re not \u2014 because we rarely hear the stories of actual women who have had procedures like these. They\u2019re incredibly rare, and doctors won\u2019t perform them unless there\u2019s a serious issue.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s choice for a running mate has entered a new and more intense phase, according to Julie Pace and Lisa Lerer of the AP, who say Elizabeth Warren, Tim Kaine, and Juli\u00e1n Castro have been asked for \u201dfor reams of personal information\u201d and are scheduling interviews with Clinton\u2019s vetting team. The case for and against Warren has been in the media, and Kaine seems like a safe, unremarkable pick. Castro is not ideologically controversial in the same way that Warren is, but would nonetheless be a choice with more upsides and downsides than Kaine.",
        "California\u2019s dalliance with atomic energy could soon be over. On Tuesday, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. announced its proposal to close Diablo Canyon, the state\u2019s last remaining nuclear power plant, by 2025. This is just the latest in the utter decimation of America\u2019s nuclear fleet. Back in 2013, the United States had 104 reactors supplying of its electricity. Since then, five reactors have been retired early and at least seven more are scheduled to close \u2014 all victims of cheap natural gas, unfavorable economics, and local opposition. These closures are almost always terrible news for climate change.",

        "Donald Trump loves to brag about his wealth. But as he heads into the general election in November, his campaign\u2019s bank account is almost empty (for a presidential candidate) \u2014 he has just $1. 3 million on hand, nearly 40 times less than presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. And a lot of the money the Trump campaign has spent is going directly back to Donald Trump.",
        "Here in the US, the Obama administration has been reluctant to encourage people to eat less meat for health and environmental reasons. The 2015 US Dietary Guidelines, for instance, remained fairly muted on the topic after fierce lobbying by the meat industry. But in China, where livestock emissions are soaring and obesity is on the rise, officials are being far less circumspect.",
        "Rep. Andy Harris ( ) and Rep. Earl Blumenauer ( ) sit on opposing ends of the political spectrum when it comes to marijuana policy. Blumenauer, dubbed Congress\u2019s \u201dtop legal pot advocate\u201d by Rolling Stone, has introduced or more than 20 pieces of legislation aimed at loosening federal marijuana restrictions. Harris, on the other hand, is known for doing the exact opposite.

So while Nemo\u2019s original forgetful sidekick Dory was immediately a fan favorite, it would be understandable if you\u2019re a little skeptical that a sequel can do her character \u2014 and the wonderful first film \u2014 justice. If that\u2019s the case, let me reassure you that you can breathe a sigh of relief. Finding Dory is great.",

You\u2019ve surely come across similarly contradictory stories suggesting cell phones may or may not be spurring brain tumors, that are either a boon for smokers or the next big public health threat, and that GMOs might feed humanity or lead to our demise.

        "Donald Trump insists that the key to stopping terrorism is having Muslims report on one another to the FBI. But Omar Mateen, the shooter who killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, was \u201dturned in\u201d to the FBI. And the person who did it was a fellow Muslim from Mateen\u2019s own mosque. In an published in the Washington Post, Mohammad Malik wrote that he tipped off the authorities after he had a conversation in which Mateen confided that he had been listening to the lectures of Anwar a radical Yemeni imam.",

When Ryan tried to retake the floor late Wednesday night, Democrats shouted him down in a display unlike anything Washington insiders have ever seen.",
        "Hillary Clinton backed a series of broadly liberal policy goals in a speech in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Wednesday, emphasizing her plan to jack up tax rates on the wealthiest Americans and largest corporations. \u201dLet\u2019s make sure that Wall Street corporations and the superrich pay their fair share of taxes,\u201d Clinton said. \u201dWe need to stand with those who are fighting for raising the minimum wage.\u201d On the face of it, this was a pretty uneventful speech: Clinton didn\u2019t break with her previous positions or announce any bold new initiatives.",

        "The national debate over gun control has reached something of a breaking point in Congress since Omar Mateen killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando earlier this month. Sen. Chris Murphy ( ) led Senate Democrats in a filibuster last week until Republicans would agree to take a vote on gun control measures. Rep. John Lewis ( ) led Democrats in a on Wednesday to make the same basic demands. These efforts are probably doomed to fail, at least in the short term.",
        "On Thursday, Britain voted to leave the European Union \u2014 an option dubbed \u201dBrexit.\u201d Almost 52 percent of Britons voted in favor of leaving. Although the \u201dleave\u201d campaign often focused on emotional arguments about immigration, there are in fact many reasons those in favor of leaving believed it would benefit the UK. They came from across the political spectrum, and some of the arguments even contradict others. Here are seven of the most significant.",
        "Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if we could all become a little smarter? The world would be better off for it. Smarter people live longer and enjoy greater across their lifetimes, psychologists have found. Intelligence gives people an edge in subtle ways. High intelligence is even thought to protect people from automobile crashes. That\u2019s why brain training games \u2014 memory puzzles \u2014 have ballooned into a industry in recent years. The idea is these memory games could help boost what\u2019s known as fluid intelligence, which is the ability to reason (as opposed to crystallized, accumulated knowledge).",

        "Univision aired a shocking interview on Tuesday with a man who claims that Orlando shooter Omar Mateen was his lover for two months \u2014 and that Mateen\u2019s deadly rampage was specifically targeted at gay Latinos. The man, who called himself \u201dMiguel,\u201d spoke on condition of anonymity and had his voice and appearance altered for an exclusive interview with Univision Noticias anchor Maria Elena Salinas, conducted in both English and Spanish.

        "Donald Trump gave his first major speech of the election attacking Hillary Clinton on Wednesday morning. It mostly focused on labeling Clinton as corrupt, his stock \u201dCrooked Hillary\u201d line expanded to an hour. But it also tried to label Clinton as incompetent, blaming her personally for a series of events ranging from the decline of manufacturing jobs in the US to the rise of ISIS in Iraq.

        "It\u2019s been a year since the Supreme Court made marriage legal nationwide in Obergefell v. Hodges. And that year has heard a lot of wedding bells. Gallup estimates that the share of LGBTQ Americans in a marriage has increased from 7. 9 percent before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to 9. 6 percent today. (That\u2019s a 22 percent increase, or 1. 7 percentage points.)

She and her sisters rake in millions every year in endorsements, all without, as Barbara Walters put it memorably, any \u201ctalents. \u201d    But Walters and others who disparage the Kardashian women as talentless have an outdated notion of the term. Do they sing, act, dance, or play sports? No. But through careful and constant feeding of the social media beast, they have created the illusion of friendship with millions of people.  Check out the video above to see how they did it.",

That means that in the coming months, British and European leaders will begin negotiating the terms of Britain\u2019s departure. Britain\u2019s exit will affect the British economy, immigration policy, and lots more. It will take years for the full consequences to become clear.

That means that the EU is on the verge of losing one of its largest and wealthiest members. The consequences will be huge for the British people.
