        "One of the reasons I think solar photovoltaic power is going to take over the world is that it is scalable in a way no other power source can be. It can be used to build power plants, or it can be scaled down. Way down. How far down? Try less than the width of a human hair. Solar cells are getting ridonkulously small South Korean scientists have created solar PV cells that are 1 micrometer thick, hundreds of times thinner than most PV and half again as thin as other kinds of PV.",
        "On Wednesday, shortly before lunchtime, Georgia Rep. John Lewis and a dozen other Democratic members of Congress marched into the House and staged a . Armed with pillows, sleeping bags, and macadamia nuts, they sat on the House floor for nearly 26 hours, refusing to leave until votes were taken on a gun control bill. After being met with total indifference from the GOP, they called off the \u2014 but not the fight for gun control measures \u2014 at 1 pm Thursday afternoon.",
        "The United Kingdom votes today on whether it should remain in the European Union \u2014 a huge decision for its citizens. The outcome is uncertain, and the campaign itself has been filled with troublesome and horrifying events, including supporters of leaving using ugly, racist rhetoric and a member of Parliament getting murdered last week. But there\u2019s one part of the Brexit vote that the US could gain a lot from imitating: It has an extremely clear, ballot. The Brexit vote ballot is a model of drafting clarity. pic. twitter.",
        "Elon Musk thinks it\u2019s almost certain that we are living in a computer simulation. In short, we are characters in an advanced version of The Sims \u2014 so advanced that it creates, well, us. I understand the instinct to treat the idea as absurd, and to ignore people who suggest these things. It\u2019s what happens when you challenge the common beliefs about reality, kind of like Aristarchus of Samos, who first thought the Earth wasn\u2019t at the center of the universe \u2014 almost 2, 000 years before Galileo.",
        "If you ask bee experts why we should worry about all those honeybees and wild bees that are famously dying off, they\u2019ll often give a simple answer: because bees pollinate so many of our crops. Without bees flitting from flower to flower, spreading pollen as they go, we wouldn\u2019t have bountiful harvests of apples, berries, melons, almonds, and cherries each year. Bees are worth literally billions of dollars. If they vanished, our grocery aisles would suffer greatly. It\u2019s a compelling reason to care. Except, as it turns out, that\u2019s also not the whole story.",
        "President Barack Obama expressed disappointment and frustration at the Supreme Court\u2019s deadlock on immigration today, which effectively killed the administration\u2019s late 2014 efforts to protect 4. 5 million immigrants from deportation. \u201dFor more than two decades now our immigration system, everybody acknowledges, has been broken,\u201d Obama said.",
        "Walk through your local grocery store, and you might discover, as Kentucky cardiologist John Mandrola did yesterday, that four apples cost $9 while a box of doughnuts costs 99 cents. \u201dThat\u2019s nuts,\u201d Mandrola noted. It is. And over the years, the American dinner plate has been stubbornly deficient in nutritious produce. A new analysis published in JAMA this week looked at US eating habits from 1999 to 2012 and found that while whole grain consumption went up and sugary drink consumption went down, there was no change in total fruits and vegetables consumed.",
        "When my girlfriend and I were in London last week, a drunk man accosted us at a pub. That\u2019s pretty par for the course there, in my experience. But this one \u2014 a white guy we\u2019ll call \u201dBob\u201d \u2014 was different. He didn\u2019t want to talk about soccer, or real ale, or his feelings on Americans. No, Bob wanted to talk about Brexit \u2014 the UK referendum that, we all now know, ended in Britain voting to leave the European Union. Bob wanted Britain to leave, and he was very open about his reason: immigration.",
        "The National Rifle Association donates millions of dollars every year to Republican lawmakers in Congress. And those same Republicans line up uniformly to block proposed gun control legislation. The implication of these two facts appears obvious: Politicians are refusing to stem the bloodshed of gun violence because they\u2019re getting what amounts to a legal bribe from lobbyists. Indeed, this familiar refrain was widely echoed again after a Senate filibuster to force a gun vote and House Democrats\u2019 unauthorized on the Capitol floor \u2014 both were responses from politicians in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in US history.",
        "The results of the historic Brexit vote are in: Britain has voted to leave the European Union. And everyone is stunned \u2014 including, apparently, United Kingdom Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, who was the main driving force behind the movement.",
        "The howl of despair with which global financial markets greeted the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to withdraw from the European Union has nothing on the disappointment and anger of the 48 percent of British voters, many of them young, who wanted to stay. Until the final days before the referendum, much of the coverage outside of the UK discussed the \u201dBrexit\u201d in economic terms.",
        "Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union is one of those rare events that should chill you to your core, as it has already chilled me to mine. Why? Because it calls into question the best thing humanity has created in its political history: the post \u2014 World War II global order. \u201dWhat\u2019s terrifying about Brexit [is] that a lot of the global economy takes certain rules of the game as given,\u201d Dan Drezner, an expert on the global economy at Tufts University\u2019s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, told me.",
        "In the months leading up to Britain\u2019s referendum on whether to leave the European Union, many economists warned over and over again that a \u201dBrexit\u201d could have awful ripple effects: Britain could lose its favorable access to European markets if it left; uncertainty could dry up business investment; the country could tumble into recession. On June 23, British voters decided to vote \u201dLeave\u201d anyway. And now they\u2019re left to grapple with the consequences \u2014 including any economic turmoil that may follow. So how bad would severing ties with the EU be?",
        "Britain voted Thursday to leave the European Union, a decision that surprised many and one whose consequences still aren\u2019t totally clear. We don\u2019t know quite yet what this will mean for the future of Britain\u2019s economy, its policies, and its relations with other European countries. There have been many twists and turns in British politics that have led to this particular moment. But you don\u2019t necessarily need to have followed those to understand why the British want to leave the European Union, and why the EU matters in the first place.",
        "In what is amounting to a very gradual concession, Bernie Sanders said during an MSNBC appearance Friday morning that he planned to vote for Hillary Clinton this fall. Asked point blank if he would \u201dvote for Hillary Clinton in November,\u201d Sanders only slightly paused before answering, \u201dyes.\u201d In explaining why, Sanders didn\u2019t mention Clinton herself, but instead focused on the dangers of a Trump presidency.",
        "If I were a citizen of the United Kingdom, I would have voted to remain part of the European Union. But I came to that view reluctantly. The EU has made possible the free movement of goods and people for a population of half a billion people. That\u2019s an amazing accomplishment, and worth defending. But the EU is also a deeply flawed institution, with a common currency that is continuing to inflict economic misery on millions of people.",
        "In the wake of the UK\u2019s vote Thursday to leave the EU, comparisons of Brexit\u2019s success to the rise of Donald Trump have been flying far and wide. This is only natural, since and nationalist sentiments played major roles in both shocking phenomena. Of course, many of these analogies are too facile. The US faces no comparable controversy over regulations from a transnational economic bureaucracy. The US electorate is much more diverse than Britain\u2019s. Trump himself has massive weaknesses in personality, popularity, and campaign mechanics that an campaign doesn\u2019t.",
        "Brexit \u2014 the United Kingdom\u2019s vote to leave the European Union \u2014 is raising urgent questions for the future of the UK. Among the many communities gobsmacked by Thursday night\u2019s voting results is UK scientists \u2014 who depend heavily on EU membership for research funding, collaboration, and recruitment of top talent. Their access to Europe\u2019s large pool of research funding is now at stake, as is their ability to share knowledge across borders. Some of the most dramatic recent advances in science in Europe \u2014 like the discovery of the Higgs boson particle \u2014 depend on international collaboration.",
        "Donald Trump celebrated the Brexit vote as a \u201dgreat thing\u201d on Friday \u2014 proof that the United Kingdom\u2019s voters had \u201dtaken back their country\u201d by abandoning the shackles of the European Union. The reaction from Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign was more muted. \u201dWe respect the choice the people of the United Kingdom have made,\u201d said Clinton\u2019s statement, released Friday morning. \u201dOur first task has to be to make sure that the economic uncertainty created by these events does not hurt working families here in America.\u201d Like most global leaders, Clinton had expressed support for the \u201dRemain\u201d camp throughout the referendum.",
        "President Barack Obama announced Friday that New York City\u2019s Stonewall Inn, the birthplace of the modern gay rights movement, will be recognized as a national monument, the first in the National Park System to be dedicated to LGBTQ Americans. \u201dToday\u2019s designation follows years of strong support from local officials, organizations, members of Congress, and citizens in New York City and across the country,\u201d the White House said in an official statement. Stonewall Inn sparked the modern movement for LGBTQ rights in June 1969 when gay and transgender patrons \u2014 led by trans women of color like Marsha P.",
        "The collapsing value of the pound in the wake of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union is frightening news for the country\u2019s economy \u2014 but great news for Americans itching to plan a last minute summer vacation. For the past few months we\u2019ve been running a Vox Vacation Index, which figures out which countries are especially good deals right now by combining inflation and exchange rates. It\u2019s a macroeconomic way to answer the question: What country is an especially good deal right now?",
        "Just days after the results of Brexit, Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU, were announced, we\u2019ve already begun to see some disturbing reports from Britain. Troubling stories about xenophobic incidents have been popping up across the country: This evening my daughter left work in Birmingham and saw group of lads corner a Muslim girl shouting \u201dGet out, we voted leave\u201d.

        "Fun fact: Brexit, the United Kingdom\u2019s narrow vote to exit the European Union, is not actually legally binding. The prime minister, be it David Cameron (who has resigned but could remain in office until October) or his successor (almost certainly former London Mayor Boris Johnson) can simply decide to ignore the result. In practice, it\u2019s hard to see that happening; the voters have spoken, and politicians are loath to overturn the express will of the people.",
        "Bill Cunningham \u2014 the New York Times street style photographer with a keen eye who earned a soft spot in the hearts of New Yorkers and many beyond \u2014 has died at age 87. He was recently hospitalized for a stroke, and his employer of almost 40 years confirmed his death today. Cunningham\u2019s \u201dOn the Street\u201d photography isn\u2019t just a staple of the New York Times Style section; it\u2019s a window into how people dress and live that, because of his incredible commitment, spans decades.",
        "In a huge victory for the movement, the Supreme Court voted Monday to strike down two major provisions that were part of an omnibus law Texas passed in 2013. The court\u2019s ruling in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt also strikes a blow to a strategy by the movement to limit abortion access incrementally, through state laws.",
        "Game of Thrones\u2019 season six finale, \u201dThe Winds of Winter,\u201d is a surprisingly muted episode of television for one that seemingly kills off half the show\u2019s cast. Wildfire explodes, Cersei takes the Iron Throne, Jon Snow\u2019s parentage is confirmed, and Dany heads for Westeros (finally) but the whole hour feels rather like an introduction to the real action. Indeed, everything after the destruction of the sept of Baelor feels rather like the show immediately launched into the season seven premiere. This isn\u2019t a bad thing.",
        "Shark Week is upon us. This Sunday night, June 26, the Discovery Channel will begin airing its 28th annual week dedicated to these carnivorous fish. \u200b(Scroll down for a detailed guide to watching. )\u200b Shark Week has been a reliable pop culture phenomenon and ratings bonanza for Discovery through the years. Stephen Colbert once called it one of our holiest weeks. But it\u2019s occasionally disappointed on scientific accuracy. Okay, that\u2019s a bit of an understatement: The Discovery Channel has, at times, completely made stuff up.",
        "Before the Brexit vote, economists were in voicing fears that the UK will suffer outside the EU. The list of consequences is long: The UK\u2019s economy will lose out on a favorable trade union, businesses may relocate their European headquarters, and the whole episode could very well spark a recession for the country. People who were counting on reason to win out were left depressed and confused after the votes were tallied. What they missed was, fundamentally, an understanding of the psychology of voting.",
        "On Thursday, the British people voted to leave the European Union by a 52 to 48 percent margin, a decision that has been dubbed \u201dBrexit.\u201d It was a surprising result that will have huge consequences for Britain, the EU, and the global economy. So why did Britain vote to leave the EU? Here are some of the most important reasons. The euro disaster has made Brits more skeptical of the EU British politics has always included a faction that\u2019s skeptical of deeper integration with the rest of Europe.",
