        "This year\u2019s Supreme Court term was unsettling. Following the sudden death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia earlier this year \u2014 and Senate Republicans\u2019 refusal to fill the seat \u2014 it initially seemed the Court might take a more reserved approach. And the justices did punt in a few areas, including birth control access, and made more convoluted decisions in other cases, but they didn\u2019t back away from all major decisions, particularly in cases.",
        "At least 49 people were killed and 239 injured when two explosions went off in Istanbul\u2019s main international airport Tuesday.

        "There\u2019s plenty to worry about if the United Kingdom actually leaves the European Union. But one particularly fraught question is what will happen to the open border between Northern Ireland (part of the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (part of the EU). If the UK wants to tightly control immigration \u2014 which was the entire point of Brexit \u2014 then it may need to restrict its border with the Republic of Ireland, which still allows unlimited migration to and from other EU countries.",

        "The House Select Committee on Benghazi has been investigating the attack on the US diplomatic mission in Libya since May 2014. The committee\u2019s report, released on Tuesday morning, contains several new details about the attack but finds no new evidence of wrongdoing by Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton, nor any new evidence of the administration plotting to hide the truth from the American people.

        "Bernie Sanders has said the Democratic Party must adopt several of his top policy priorities if it\u2019s going to successfully represent the interests of Americans. He got a bit closer to that goal when party officials released details around several key policies after meetings this weekend in St. Louis, Missouri. The platform just outlines the key \u201dideas and beliefs\u201d of the party \u2014 it doesn\u2019t bind any of its members to particular actions, but it\u2019s supposed to represent a sort of blueprint for where the party is headed.",
        "Britain\u2019s main opposition party, Labour, should stand to benefit from the fact that its rivals, the Conservatives, are in total turmoil following last Thursday\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. Prime Minister David Cameron lost the Brexit referendum and announced his resignation. There\u2019s a contentious leadership contest pitting populist Boris Johnson against establishmentarian Theresa May coming soon. And the party\u2019s members of Parliament are divided nearly in half on the question of whether the country is making a huge mistake by leaving the European Union. But if anything, Labour is in even greater disarray after the Brexit vote.",
        "The Supreme Court decision to strike down two restrictive abortion laws in Texas will likely have a ripple effect across the country, potentially forcing other states to drop their own similar laws in the coming years. The Supreme Court ruled Monday that two Texas laws were unconstitutional: one that required abortion clinics to be certified as ambulatory surgical centers and another requiring doctors to gain admitting privileges at a local hospital. The Court found that in both cases, these restrictions put an \u201dundue burden\u201d on women seeking to terminate pregnancies without doing enough to protect women\u2019s health.",

        "The bizarre roller coaster of United Kingdom politics took another twist on Thursday as Boris Johnson, the favorite to succeed Prime Minister David Cameron, announced that he won\u2019t run for the position after all. Johnson \u2014 the former London mayor whose populist appeal, Brexit support, and imperviousness to gaffes (not to mention physical resemblance) have drawn comparisons to Donald Trump \u2014 seemed like the politician best poised to benefit from the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the European Union.",
        "We\u2019ve been conditioned to think of exercise as a key ingredient \u2014 perhaps the most important ingredient \u2014 of any weight loss effort.

        "The verbal attacks by the Republican nominee Donald Trump and his supporters on President Barack Obama for avoiding the phrase \u201dradical Islam\u201d in his public pronouncements are simplistic, racially inflammatory \u2014 and flatly misinformed. The latest to level the charge is Rudolph Giuliani.",
        "One surprising thing about Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU is that Britain\u2019s economy has been doing better than a lot of European countries. Unemployment in the United Kingdom has fallen to 5 percent, its lowest level in a decade. In contrast, the average unemployment rate among countries that (unlike Britain) have joined the EU\u2019s common currency, the euro, is still above 10 percent. And many economists argue that\u2019s not a coincidence \u2014 that poor policies by the European Central Bank have systematically weakened growth in countries that have adopted the euro.",

        "The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Fisher v. Texas last week dealt a major blow to one of affirmative action opponents\u2019 key arguments: that such programs are a form of \u201dreverse racism.\u201d The case\u2019s plaintiff, Abigail Fisher, maintained that the University of Texas Austin used her racial identity as a white person against her in the admissions process to admit less qualified students of color.

        "In between the vague rhetoric about making America great again during an economic policy speech on Tuesday, Donald Trump seems to have made quite a few factual errors \u2014 many of which correspondent Desi Lydic blew up on Wednesday\u2019s The Daily Show. \u201dIt\u2019s time once again to fact check Donald Trump,\u201d Lydic said.",
        "In the past two days, both major political parties in the UK have fallen into complete and total chaos. You can blame Brexit. On Tuesday, members of Parliament for the Labour Party held a vote of against their party leader, Jeremy Corbyn. The vote passed by an overwhelming margin.

        "Speaking to the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa on Wednesday evening, President Barack Obama took the opportunity to defend his administration\u2019s broad approach to globalization and inequality, slamming isolationists and xenophobes on the right as well as the dogmatic laissez faire ideology that he believes gives them succor.
