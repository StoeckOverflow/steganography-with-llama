        "Quite a few logistical questions remain unanswered in the weeks ahead of the Republican National Convention. Among them: Who will attend, who will speak, and how will Donald Trump, the man of the hour, arrive? According to a New York Times piece published Friday, the uncertainty is a dual result of Trump\u2019s own unpredictability and top Republicans\u2019 increasing desire to keep him at arm\u2019s length. Though Trump has previously insisted his convention would represent a break from the \u201dboring\u201d political rites of conventions past, the reality of the situation appears to have softened his stance.",
        "Why on earth are they still talking about Benghazi? This was the widespread reaction among liberals (and even some conservatives) on Tuesday after Rep. Trey Gowdy released his House committee report, the ninth investigation into the 2012 attack in Libya that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. Gowdy\u2019s report contained no major new revelations, and Gowdy was accused in the press of opportunistically advancing a partisan agenda. In his defense, he insisted that he just wanted people to look at the facts.",
        "When President Barack Obama took office in 2009, LGBTQ soldiers couldn\u2019t serve openly in the US military \u2014 as a result of \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d (DADT) for gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals and a ban, through military medical regulations, for transgender people. Now both bans are gone: Congress repealed DADT in 2010, and the US military officially implemented the repeal in 2011. Last June, the Pentagon announced it would phase out its ban on trans troops over the next year.",
        "This July 4, let\u2019s not mince words: American independence in 1776 was a monumental mistake. We should be mourning the fact that we left the United Kingdom, not cheering it. Of course, evaluating the wisdom of the American Revolution means dealing with counterfactuals. As any historian would tell you, this is a messy business. We obviously can\u2019t be entirely sure how America would have fared if it had stayed in the British Empire longer, perhaps gaining independence a century or so later, along with Canada.",
        "Young people in the United Kingdom were shocked and dismayed when the Brexit vote came in last week. The youth \u2014 by a large margin \u2014 supported remaining in the European Union. Many of their parents and grandparents did not. \u201cBrexit is a middle finger from the baby boomers to young people like me,\u201d wrote Jack Lennard, a UK graduate student, in an essay for Vox.",
        "On Monday night, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton were both at the Phoenix airport, waiting on the tarmac. Lynch said that Clinton then walked to her plane, uninvited, to say hi.",
        "There is a lot of apparel sold in the United States. But like most other apparel sold in the United States, it is largely not manufactured here. The reason it\u2019s not manufactured in the United States is that apparel manufacturing is a line of work, and it\u2019s generally more profitable to do it abroad. None of that is particularly controversial. But one thing Donald Trump is promising to do on the campaign trail is reverse a consensus in favor of greater openness to foreign imports.",
        "It just got a lot harder for the San Francisco Police Department to deny allegations of racism: A judge ruled on Thursday that there was \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d of racial discrimination displayed in the department\u2019s handling of drug stings. US District Judge Edward Chen refused to dismiss claims of police racism filed by 12 black people facing drug charges after being arrested in San Francisco\u2019s Tenderloin neighborhood, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Records show police officers were overheard making racist references to black men and women.",
        "Hollywood\u2019s latest mega sequel, Independence Day: Resurgence, has not exactly recruited enthusiastic reviews from critics. Barry Hertz at the Globe and Mail described it as \u201done of the most aggressively stupid blockbusters ever made.\u201d Slant Magazine\u2019s Chuck Bowen touted it as \u201da pitfall albatross of corporate capitalism.\u201d Vox\u2019s own Todd VanDerWerff called it \u201da snoozing house cat in a sunbeam on a hot summer day.\u201d That sounds bad. Really bad. But how does Resurgence stack up against recent history\u2019s worst movie sequels?",
        "The US releases some (questionable) data on drone strikes; ISIS takes hostages in Bangladesh. Vox Sentences is written by Dylan Matthews and Dara Lind. TOP NEWS US government gives itself a 95% in drone strikes Isaac Images The US government released information Friday afternoon about its use of drone strikes in counterterrorism operations outside of conventional wars (that is, in countries like Pakistan and Yemen rather than Afghanistan). The estimates state that the US has killed 2, 500 terrorists since 2009, and 64 to 116 civilians.",
        "Every Sunday, we pick a new episode of the week. It could be good. It could be bad. It will always be interesting. You can read the archives here. The episode of the week for June 26 through July 2 is the latest installment of TBS\u2019s Full Frontal With Samantha Bee. The most remarkable moment of the latest episode of Full Frontal With Samantha Bee wasn\u2019t when Bee ripped into Brexit. It wasn\u2019t when David Tennant, the former Doctor Who star, read tweets excoriating Donald Trump in his thick Scottish accent.",
        "Back in January 2016, the New Yorker published a cover showing America\u2019s most famous presidents recoiling in horror at the image of Donald Trump on the TV screen: The cover was widely mocked by liberal commentators \u2014 not because of its attack on Trump but for suggesting that the depicted presidents represented a moral standard worthy of our praise and respect. \u201dWhat is distasteful about Trump is not that he offends American values,\u201d wrote Mother Jones\u2019s Tim Murphy in one typical reaction.",
        "It\u2019s the weekend of the Glorious Fourth! And whether you\u2019re spending it inside by the AC or outside by the pool, one thing\u2019s for sure: The national holiday will afford you some extra time to read. So here\u2019s the best the internet has to offer on books and related topics for the week of June 27, 2016. In this, the last week of the Toast, here are the site\u2019s last bookish posts: Carrie Frye gives us a thorough and fascinating history of Miss Havisham, and Carvell Wallace writes beautifully on the Negro Motorist Green Book.",
        "Talking about pubic hair grooming was once taboo. Those days are long gone. Look no further than popular celebrity books or hit TV shows like Girls or Broad City, where pubes are discussed casually and frequently. Scientists have also begun to examine grooming trends. For a new study in JAMA Dermatology, researchers asked more than 3, 000 American women about their pubic habits. Fully 84 percent reported they had done some form of pube modification in their lifetime. Of those groomers, 62 percent reported going all the way \u2014 removing every last centimeter of hair down there.",
        "About halfway through the pilot episode of Preacher, AMC\u2019s TV adaptation of Garth Ennis\u2019s popular comic book series, I sat up and took notice. \u201dWho is that?\u201d I wondered, as a young woman fought off assailants in a car barreling through a cornfield, then holed up in a farmhouse and taught some kids how to make a bazooka out of coffee cans. \u201dThat\u201d was Ruth Negga, who was born in Ethiopia and began her career in Britain. She\u2019s since become a sort of success in American movies and TV shows, popping up in an Agents of S. H. I.",
        "On May 10, George R. R. Martin released a new chapter from the next book in his A Song of Ice and Fire series, The Winds of Winter. It offers a tantalizing glimpse of what\u2019s to come in the world of Game of Thrones as it exists on the page, but it\u2019s really just a glimpse: As of this writing, The Winds of Winter is still in progress, and no release date has been announced.",
        "If there\u2019s one region of the United States with a notoriously bad reputation for racism, it\u2019s the South. But in the latest episode of MTV\u2019s Decoded, Franchesca Ramsey sounds a hearty spoiler alert: Racism is a problem in the North and West too. And it always has been. \u201dRacism also has a long history in Northern and progressive Western states,\u201d Ramsey said.",
        "Sometimes the world really can get together and avert a major ecological catastrophe before it\u2019s too late. Case in point: A new study in Science finds evidence that the Earth\u2019s protective ozone layer is finally healing \u2014 all thanks to global efforts in the 1980s to phase out CFCs and other destructive chemicals. This is one of the great environmental success stories of all time. Back in the 1970s, scientists first realized that we were rapidly depleting Earth\u2019s stratospheric ozone layer, which protects us from the sun\u2019s harmful ultraviolet rays. The culprit?",
        "In an electric June 29 speech delivered at the New America Foundation, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts threw her rising political weight and prestige behind an idea that\u2019s been bubbling beneath the surface of the Democratic Party for several years: The United States needs a revived and reinvigorated antitrust policy. The Obama administration itself shares \u2014 and to some extent has driven, via a Council of Economic Advisers report and some executive actions \u2014 the analysis that the American economy suffers from a shortfall of competition.",
        "By far the most disquieting question to come out of \u201dThe Winds of Winter,\u201d Game of Thrones\u2019 season six finale, concerns an act we didn\u2019t witness: Just what was the zombified Gregor Clegane doing to Septa Unella behind that closed door? Lest you\u2019ve forgotten, Unella is the \u201dShame!\u201d nun who presided over Cersei\u2019s humiliating walk of atonement at the end of season five. And while Cersei spent most of \u201dThe Winds of Winter\u201d claiming the Iron Throne for herself (after suffering her own devastating tragedy) she made sure to spare a few minutes to get her revenge.",
        "Earlier this year, the New York Times turned heads by asking whether the hit Broadway musical Hamilton\u2019s historical fudging on certain points is, well, good for us. It\u2019s an excellent piece of concern trolling, giving several historians an opportunity to about the musical\u2019s overglorification of Alexander Hamilton, the immigrant revolutionary who authored the Federalist Papers and founded the US Treasury.",
        "In retrospect, it seems almost too perfect that the most notable scandal of the Obama administration, the one that necessitated a public statement from the director of the FBI, was about Hillary Clinton rather than Barack Obama. Or maybe it was one of two somewhat notable scandals, along with Benghazi \u2014 another case where the scrutiny on Clinton was far greater than on the actual president. It makes sense because the Clintons have, since even before Bill Clinton won the Democratic nomination in 1992, been magnets for scandal, many of them nothings.",
        "NASA has shot humans to the moon, sent robots to Mars, and even sent a probe beyond the borders of our solar system. All these have been herculean efforts. But this July 4, when the Juno spacecraft successfully entered orbit around Jupiter, Scott Bolton \u2014 Juno\u2019s principal investigator \u2014 proclaimed, \u201cWe just did the hardest thing NASA has ever done. \u201d A true ranking of the difficultly of NASA feats is impossible. But Bolton\u2019s comments were not hyperbole. Inserting Juno into orbit around Jupiter was a huge, risky $1.",
        "Despite last month\u2019s Brexit referendum, Britain still hasn\u2019t formally started the process of withdrawing from the European Union. There are lots of reasons, but one of the biggest is that it\u2019s really hard for any British leader to do anything about it without causing a political or economic crisis. The following Venn diagram, from Twitter user Quantian, perfectly explains why. A bit of background first. In order to withdraw from the EU, Britain needs to invoke Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union.",
        "In a Saturday tweet, Donald Trump deployed a meme accusing Hillary Clinton of having made history by being \u201dthe most corrupt candidate ever.\u201d It was a somewhat banal charge that probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten much attention except for the graphic design: It featured a Star of David superimposed on a bed of money. Further sleuthing by Anthony Smith of Mic indicated that the meme had previous appeared on the 8Chan forum a hotbed of \u201d \u201d internet activism where overt racism and flourishes.",
        "ISIS vowed to make Ramadan violent, and it has delivered. As the Muslim holy month came to a close in the past week, a wave of terrorist attacks hit places around the world, including bombings at Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk Airport, the execution of roughly 20 hostages in Bangladesh, and one of the deadliest suicide bombing in Baghdad\u2019s recent history. Clearly, the group is stepping up its terrorism efforts. Why? According to Clint Watts, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute (FPRI) the answer is clear.",
        "In a statement Tuesday morning, FBI Director James Comey announced that the bureau had completed its investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and was recommending to the Justice Department that no charges be filed. \u201dAlthough there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case,\u201d Comey said. Comey\u2019s statement was harsh and, at times, damning: He said that 113 emails on Clinton\u2019s servers contained information that was classified at the time.",
        "Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker is hitting the campaign trail today with Donald Trump, planning stops at Trump Tower in New York and in North Carolina. Corker, who\u2019s been mooted as a potential running mate for Trump, has gone back and forth on the presumptive Republican nominee over the course of the campaign \u2014 reflecting the party establishment\u2019s discomfort with its but also that a ticket would be a clear step toward healing the divides and unifying the party.",
        "The term \u201dsafe space\u201d often gets thrown around, and mocked, in debates about social justice and free speech on college campuses. To some, safe spaces symbolize the \u201dcoddling\u201d of America\u2019s youth, the oversensitivity of modern progressivism, and even a serious threat to free speech. Take the University of Chicago\u2019s warning to incoming students that made it very clear there would be no safe spaces or trigger warnings.",
        "On Monday, Ian Urbina of the New York Times published an epic investigation into the breathtaking fiasco that is the Kemper \u201dclean coal\u201d plant in Mississippi. Everyone should read it. The Kemper project was supposed to be a lifeline for coal in a world that\u2019s inching toward energy. Owned by Southern Company, the plant aimed to convert coal into synthetic gas, burn it to create electricity, and then capture the waste carbon dioxide and bury it underground rather than let it waft into the atmosphere. Fewer CO2 emissions, less global warming. Or at least that was the hope. .."
