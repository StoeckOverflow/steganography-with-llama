        "Each week throughout Game of Thrones\u2019 sixth season, a handful of Vox\u2019s writers have gathered to discuss the latest episode \u2014 and now we\u2019re doing the same with the finale. Before you dig in, check out our recap of \u201dThe Winds of Winter,\u201d as well the archive of our entire discussion to date. Concluding our discussion for the season is culture editor Todd VanDerWerff. Todd VanDerWerff: Now that the sixth season of Game of Thrones is over, the long wait for any information at all about the seventh season (which will air in 2017) begins.",
        "There are two parts to any criminal sentence for any crime involving sex. There\u2019s the standard sentence: prison time or probation. As soon as the first sentence ends, the second one begins. After getting released from prison, an has to sign up for his state\u2019s sex offender registry. If he moves to another state, he\u2019ll have to sign up there too. Depending on the state and the seriousness of the crime, his name, picture, and information will be publicly listed for all to see \u2014 permanently. Related I\u2019m a public defender.",
        "This Wednesday, the festival of San Fermin will commence in Pamplona, Spain, and on Thursday the festival\u2019s most famous attraction will start: the running of the bulls, where every day six bulls are released to dash 930 yards (a little more than half a mile) through the city\u2019s streets to its bullring while humans try to outrun them and avoid injury and thousands of spectators look on. The event is typically enjoyed as a kind of extreme sport, where runners risk being gored for the adrenaline high the danger provokes. It\u2019s quick, lasting just over two minutes last year.",
        "It\u2019s been called a \u201dbulimia machine\u201d that\u2019s \u201d foul,\u201d something out \u201dDavid Cronenberg\u2019s imagination.\u201d It\u2019s also been called a potentially useful obesity treatment. The provocative new device in question is the AspireAssist, designed to allow obese people who\u2019ve failed to lose weight by most other means drain ingested food from their stomach into the toilet. This may sound extreme, but not long ago bariatric surgery also seemed barbaric \u2014 and it has quickly become a common treatment for extreme obesity. Early initial reports about AspireAssist actually show some promise (with several caveats, of course).",
        "The Minnesota police officer who drew widespread protests after he shot and killed Philando Castile has been found not guilty after being charged with manslaughter. After 27 hours of deliberation, the jury found St. Anthony, Minnesota, police officer Jeronimo Yanez not guilty for manslaughter, as well as two counts of dangerous discharge of a firearm, according to the Star Tribune. The July 2016 shooting captured nationwide attention after Diamond Reynolds, Castile\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, the aftermath on Facebook. The image was grisly, showing a black man\u2019s slumped, bloodied body \u2014 the result of yet another police shooting in America.",
        "Hillary Clinton had a bad day on Tuesday, thanks to FBI Director James Comey\u2019s decision to pair his announcement that nothing illegal happened with her emails with a very public tongue lashing about how \u201dcareless\u201d her setup had been, and how various public statements she\u2019d made about it were false or misleading.",
        "Nakia Jones, a black female police officer with the Warrensville Heights Police Department in Ohio, wants the world to know that she is outraged by the conduct of her fellow officers who killed Alton Sterling in Louisiana. \u201dIf you are white and you work in a black community and you are racist, you need to be ashamed of yourself,\u201d Jones said, in a powerful message addressing other police officers that has gone viral. \u201dYou stood up there and took an oath. . .. How dare you stand next to me in the same uniform and murder somebody?",
        "To defend his use of stereotypes in an attack on Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump turned to an unlikely source: the hit Disney movie Frozen. On Saturday, Trump\u2019s campaign shared a meme charging Hillary Clinton as the \u201dmost corrupt candidate ever,\u201d featuring a Star of David on a background of dollar bills. Trump\u2019s team deleted the tweet, replaced it with one that didn\u2019t have the Star of David on it, and said it \u201dwas not created by the campaign nor was it sourced from an site.\u201d \u201dIt was lifted from an Twitter user where countless images appear,\u201d the statement said.",
        "Police academies spend about 110 hours training their recruits on firearms skills and \u2014 but just eight hours on conflict management and mediation. This is according to a 2006 report from the Department of Justice, which looked at the median time state and local academies spent on various law enforcement skills. The report is a decade old, but it\u2019s the most recent data we have on how much time is usually spent training police officers to diffuse tense situations.",
        "Within days of President Obama\u2019s inauguration seven and a half years ago, the Tea Party took national politics by storm. Sympathetic pundits and affiliated politicians claimed that the movement amounted to the formation of a new third party that represented widespread economic concerns, its motivation based on outrage over deficit spending, the stimulus package, and the national debt. Yet coverage of Tea Party rallies also included images of protest signs covered with racist slogans such as \u2018\u2018A Village in Kenya Is Missing Its Idiot: Deport Obama!",
        "On Wednesday night\u2019s episode of Comedy Central\u2019s The Nightly Show, host Larry Wilmore devoted a segment to talking about the death of Alton Sterling, a man police shot to death in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, this week. \u201dThank God for fucking cellphones,\u201d Wilmore said. \u201dBecause we would never even hear about incidents like this this otherwise. In fact, part of what makes people in the black community so enraged about this is for years, we never had evidence for these things.\u201d Sterling\u2019s shooting was captured by bystanders \u2014 the only video evidence we\u2019ve seen so far.",
        "It\u2019s one of the most hotly contested areas of dieting: How much do carbohydrates matter when it comes to weight loss? If you ask a number of celebrities and authors of diet books, it\u2019s pasta, bread, and cookies that stand between you and a svelte physique. These proselytizers make very specific claims about the effect cutting carbs has on the body, suggesting that it can speed up fat loss and increase calorie burn. Indeed, many dieters have found at least success following schemes like the Atkins or Dukan diet.",
        "In his last few seconds of life, Alton Sterling seemed completely immobile. Two Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police officers had pinned him to the floor, flat on his back. But even as Sterling seemed completely unable to move, one of the police officers yelled, \u201dHe\u2019s got a gun!\u201d Within seconds, an officer shot Sterling, who was still pinned to the ground by the cops. Sterling died of multiple gunshot wounds. After a bystander released video of the shooting, people quickly protested in the area and voiced their anger on social media.",
        "Note: This article contains multiple stills from \u201dFamous,\u201d including some NSFW images. On June 24, Kanye West released the controversial video for his controversial song \u201dFamous.\u201d Actually, according to Kanye, he released the visual to \u201dFamous,\u201d suggesting the videos that accompany his songs are more than music videos: They\u2019re art. Almost immediately, the internet was awash in both fawning praise and outraged critiques. Was the video, which features naked replicas of multiple celebrities asleep in bed together, tawdry trash? Was it 10 minutes of objectification, rape culture at its worst?",
        "On Wednesday night, police officers shot and killed reportedly legal gun owner Philando Castile \u2014 and although the details remain unclear, it seems the officers may have panicked and shot Castile to death when Castile reached for his driver\u2019s license, after disclosing he had a gun. This would seem like a standard case for the National Rifle Association: A legal gun owner was shot for doing everything you\u2019re supposed to do \u2014 reportedly getting his concealed carry permit and telling an officer during a traffic stop that a gun was present in the car.",
        "It\u2019s difficult to overstate this: White America has gotten so much more aware of, and more outraged by, police shootings of black American men now that they can be caught on video. Video recordings can\u2019t totally erase the implicit bias that often leads people (especially white people) to fear black people and trust police. But they\u2019re often a reality check: an improvement on the faux \u201che said\u201d that allow people\u2019s preexisting biases to determine their interpretations of what actually happened when a person of color is reportedly harassed, beaten, or shot by a police officer.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s team went on the offensive against Donald Trump on Thursday, releasing a new attack ad that excoriates the real estate mogul for bilking a small architecture firm: As it released the video, Clinton\u2019s team also unveiled a set of new policy proposals designed to prevent big firms from using \u201dpredatory behavior\u201d to exploit smaller businesses. Those policy proposals may be more difficult to implement than Clinton\u2019s team would like to admit, but they reinforce the idea that Clinton is going to try turning Trump\u2019s key selling point \u2014 his business record \u2014 into a political liability.",
        "For months, Congress has been agonizing over what to do about labels for genetically modified foods. Various states have debated labeling for years. But the issue suddenly gained urgency on July 1, when Vermont became the first state in the country to require GMO labels in grocery stores. Many food manufacturers despised Vermont\u2019s law; they\u2019ve been pulling their products from the state\u2019s shelves and lobbying Congress to stop the law. Their big complaint was that if states enact their own GMO labeling laws, it would create an unworkable \u201dpatchwork\u201d of local rules.",
        "The Chilcot report, the UK government\u2019s official report on the catastrophic decision to invade Iraq, was released on Wednesday morning, seven years after it was initially convened. The report delivers a pretty devastating verdict on the war, concluding that Saddam Hussein posed no imminent threat to the West and war was avoidable. But from an American point of view, the most striking part of the report is how foreseeable the disaster that unfolded after the invasion was. When you read the British government\u2019s intelligence assessments, they predict, plus or minus a few details, exactly what happened after the war.",
        "Another black man killed by police; the 2016 Olympics is going to be a disaster. Vox Sentences is written by Dylan Matthews and Dara Lind. TOP NEWS His name was Philando Castile Stephen Images On Wednesday night, Philando Castile was killed by a Falcon Heights, Minnesota, police officer while seated in his car during a traffic stop.

        "At least one sniper shot 14 people, killing five police officers, in Dallas late Thursday night, turning a peaceful protest against the police shootings of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, into a scene of chaos and carnage. The wounded include seven police officers and two civilians. It was the deadliest day for US law enforcement since the attacks. One suspect has been identified as Micah X. Johnson, according to the Associated Press.",
        "Like any other political issue in America, it\u2019s easy to think of police shootings in a polarized way \u2014 Black Lives Matter and its supporters are liberal, and those who defend police are conservative. But this is a huge oversimplification. Many conservative writers have issues with police officers\u2019 excessive use of force and how it disproportionately hurts black Americans.",
        "To many Americans, Philando Castile will forever be known as yet another hashtag; yet another black man shot by a police officer this year. For the children and families of J. J. Hill Montessori school in St. Paul, Minnesota, he was a role model. In the disturbing video captured by Castile\u2019s partner Diamond Reynolds in the moments after he was shot, she proclaimed, \u201dHe\u2019s a good man. He works for St. Paul Public Schools.\u201d Based on the outpouring of support from families whose children saw Castile every day, his impact was clearly overwhelmingly positive.",
        "The US economy gained 287, 000 jobs in June, the strongest monthly result of 2016. The unexpectedly strong result helps put to rest fears of the US economy tipping into recession \u2014 a recession that would have been bad for Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances of capturing the White House in November. In recent years, the economy has gained about 200, 000 jobs in a typical month. That\u2019s more than enough to keep up with population growth, which is why the unemployment rate has been gradually declining over the past few years.",
        "Right before a horrifying shooting killed five police officers, people in Dallas were marching in the streets to protest police violence \u2014 specifically, the killings this week of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota. But until sniper fire rang out from nearby rooftops, the protest itself seemed to be a model of goodwill between police and protesters. The Dallas Police Department\u2019s official Twitter account featured officers posing for friendly photos with protesters. Demonstration in #Dallas @ Belo Garden Park pic. twitter.",
        "Donald Trump thinks he knows what\u2019s best \u2014 when it comes to how to make a deal or what shampoo to use. This is the conclusion we here at Vox drew from reading all 12 of Trump\u2019s books on politics and business. We wanted to better understand Trump\u2019s candidacy and how his experiences and outlook on life might shape his views as a world leader. And, frankly, we wanted to understand what makes him tick.",
        "The Night Of, HBO\u2019s new attempt to fill that True Detective \u2014 size hole in its lineup and in your heart, has received the kind of \u201dinstant masterpiece!\u201d reviews that can easily lead to overhype. So let\u2019s start by talking about what the show isn\u2019t. Rating 4. 5 It\u2019s not remarkably new or innovative. It doesn\u2019t take the prestige drama format and try anything remotely unique with it.",
        "\u201dInternships,\u201d the headline in the New York Times\u2019s opinion section read, \u201dAre Not a Privilege.\u201d The was by Darren Walker of the Ford Foundation, and it discussed what he called \u201dAmerica\u2019s complex\u201d \u2014 the way unpaid internships effectually lock out diverse, talented young workers who cannot possibly afford to work for free. It got media types talking about journalism\u2019s unpaid internship economy and why it\u2019s insidious.",
        "On Thursday, Donald Trump flew to DC to meet with congressional Republicans and assuage their concerns about his candidacy. No worries appeared to have been addressed, but he did manage to generate some new ones, like, \u201dHas Donald Trump ever read the Constitution?\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Sean Sullivan and Philip Rucker report: Rep. Mark Sanford ( . C.) left the meeting worried about Trump\u2019s grasp on the basics of the Constitution. At a lunch with reporters afterward, he recalled that the candidate did not seem to know what he was promising to defend. \u201dI wasn\u2019t particularly impressed,\u201d said Sanford.",
        "Riri Williams is 15 years old. She\u2019s black. She wears her hair naturally. She\u2019s a genius, enrolling at MIT. And when the dust settles after Civil War II, Marvel\u2019s latest crossover comic book event, Riri Williams will be Iron Man. Giving a black girl one of the most recognizable names in the Marvel universe and turning her into a flagship hero is a monumental move for the comic book company \u2014 one that will affect more than just Marvel\u2019s future comic book stories."
