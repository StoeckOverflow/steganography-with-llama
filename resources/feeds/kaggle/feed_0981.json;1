        "President Obama is calling on Congress to \u201drevisit\u201d a public option for Obamacare, citing the lack of health insurance options in some of the law\u2019s marketplaces. \u201dBased on experience with the [Affordable Care Act] I think Congress should revisit a public plan to compete alongside private insurers in areas of the country where competition is limited,\u201d Obama wrote in an article for the Journal of the American Medical Association published Monday. The article marks the first time a sitting president has written for the medical journal, which is considered one of the country\u2019s most prestigious.",
        "The United States\u2019 women\u2019s gymnastics team has nothing to fear at the upcoming Rio Olympics. Barring some forces beyond their control, like China locking probable champion Simone Biles in a restroom for the entire competition, they will win gold. On Sunday, July 10, the US selected the five women who will win gold in Rio. Biles, Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas, Madison Kocian, and Laurie Hernandez have made the cut. They will prove that the United States is a gymnastics dynasty by defending the team event title they earned in London in 2012.",
        "A night when protesters flooded the streets in cities across the country culminated in several violent encounters with police and hundreds of people arrested, including prominent Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson, who marched with local demonstrators in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Mckesson joined activists there following the shooting of Alton Sterling, 37, who died early Tuesday morning as he sold CDs in front of a convenience store. According to the Baton Rouge Advocate, about 100 people were arrested there, including Mckesson, who was handcuffed as he filmed the demonstration and a standoff with police.",
        "On July 7, at least one sniper opened fire on police officers during a peaceful protest in Dallas over police shootings. The sniper shot 14 people, killing five police officers. After a couple days, authorities and family have released the names of all the dead. Here\u2019s what we know about those victims. Brent Thompson, 43, Dallas Area Rapid Transit officer Brent Thompson was a police veteran for Dallas Area Rapid Transit, the public transportation agency.

        "You may have heard stories of people hunting down Pok\u00e9mon on their office desks, in hospital rooms, and even in bathrooms. One teenage girl even found a dead body while looking for Pok\u00e9mon. And police in Missouri claimed that four suspected robbers lured in victims with a chance of catching Pok\u00e9mon in a new game called Pok\u00e9mon Go. What the hell is going on? What is Pok\u00e9mon Go? Well, after a few years lying relatively low, the Pok\u00e9mon, which exploded in popularity in the late 1990s, is again taking the world by storm.",
        "I picked the dog I wanted in the same way I picked a favorite Pok\u00e9mon. I looked in the classified section next to the automotive ads and found a breed named \u201dPeekapoo,\u201d which was close enough to \u201dPikachu.\u201d No one ever tells you that begging for a dog as an could affect you deeply as an adult. They just make you promise to clean up after the animal. But when Rainbow was 10, my parents moved abroad, and she came to live with me in New York.",
        "Asked by Republican members of Congress if he could be counted on to uphold Article I of the Constitution \u2014 that\u2019s the one outlining the powers and prerogatives of Congress \u2014 Donald Trump said, \u201dI want to protect Article I, Article II, Article XII.\u201d As Rep. Mark Sanford recounted to Philip Rucker and Sean Sullivan of the Washington Post, one problem here is that there is no Article XII of the Constitution. It\u2019s a bit of a gaffe, of course. The real problem, however, isn\u2019t in the comical misstatement.",
        "\u201dThe Beach,\u201d the premiere of HBO\u2019s new crime drama The Night Of, probably left you with a few big questions. Chief among them, of course, is, \u201dDid Naz, the young kid accused of murder, actually do it?\u201d There\u2019s also: \u201dIf Naz didn\u2019t to it, then who did?\u201d It\u2019s easy to see why the police immediately conclude that he\u2019s the perpetrator. After all, both his and the victim\u2019s DNA are all over the crime scene, and he was caught with the murder weapon on him. Related The Night Of is like a really long Law & Order episode. It\u2019s excellent.",
        "After a long, often contentious, and surprisingly successful primary campaign, Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton for the presidency on Tuesday morning at a New Hampshire rally. \u201dSecretary Clinton has won the Democratic nominating process, and I congratulate her for that. She will be the Democratic nominee for president and I intend to do everything I can to make certain she will be the next president of the United States,\u201d Sanders said.",
        "Harry Houck caused an uproar on Monday when he implied that black people were \u201dprone to criminality\u201d during a CNN panel. \u201dFacts have got to matter,\u201d Houck said. \u201dIf we were going to make some changes to what\u2019s going on here, the police have already recognized the fact that we\u2019ve got some issues we\u2019ve got to deal with. Now the black community has got to also understand that they have issues they have to deal with.\u201d But the facts Houck cited are telling.",
        "Bernie Sanders\u2019s campaign is coming to an end. But what did it all mean, anyway \u2014 for the American left, for the Democratic Party, and for the country? And now that Sanders has lost, where should activists who hope for progressive change focus their energies? To get the long view on these topics, I recently spoke with Michael Kazin, a history professor at Georgetown, of the political magazine Dissent, and author of an excellent book on the history of activism in America.",
        "Very often when I read a profile of a woman who is also a celebrity, I snag on a sentence that seems to suspiciously belittle or even objectify the woman in question. I\u2019ll stop and check the byline \u2014 and more often than not, the offending sentence was written by a man. At this point, I usually sigh and trudge on to the end of the story, to see if the attitude my sixth sense has detected is present throughout the rest of the piece. It almost always is.",

Official clocks will hit 23:59:59 as usual, but then they\u2019ll say 23:59:60, before rolling over into 2017. This is known as a \u201dleap second,\u201d and timekeepers slip them in periodically to keep our clocks in sync with the Earth\u2019s rotation. They do this because it technically takes Earth a bit longer than 24 hours to complete a full rotation \u2014 86, 400. 002 seconds rather than 86, 400.",
        "I\u2019ve written some mean things about Indiana Gov. Mike Pence over the years, and now that he\u2019s in the national spotlight as the Republican vice presidential candidate, the time has come to tell the truth: I owe him an apology. I spent years slagging Pence as stupid and moronic simply because he was a leading member of Congress participating in a major debate over a public policy issue that he didn\u2019t understand at all. At the time, it struck me as genuinely shocking.",
        "After a stunning Twitter rant, it\u2019s official: Pop star DJ Calvin Harris does not <3 Hiddleswift. If that sentence makes no sense to you, take heart! You\u2019ve somehow avoided weeks of speculation and controversy surrounding photogenic new \u201dcouple\u201d Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston, who have been photographed clutching each other\u2019s hands from blustery Rhode Island beaches to the Coliseum and beyond.",
        "Donald Trump officially accepted the Republican Party\u2019s nomination for the presidency with a speech championing facts. \u201dI will always tell you the truth,\u201d Trump said at a campaign rally in August.

        "With Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton expected to announce their vice presidential nominees in the next week or two, the media is frantically speculating about whether their picks will help \u2014 or hurt \u2014 their electoral prospects. Will Trump try to shore up his support among evangelical conservatives? Or will he pick an \u201dattack dog\u201d who will tear into Clinton? Will Clinton want a progressive firebrand to win over Bernie Sanders ? Or will she attempt to cut into Trump\u2019s big lead among white men?",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 If you had any illusion that the Republican Party might shake its image after losing on marriage, the drafted Republican platform should dispel that notion. Republican Party delegates officially approved the platform at the national convention in Cleveland on Monday. It is now the official policy platform of the entire GOP. Still, it\u2019s not clear how much the platform really matters in terms of setting policy. But the platform at the very least conveys a sense of how the GOP will approach LGBTQ issues in the near future \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t look good for LGBTQ people.",
        "On Friday afternoon, an faction of the Turkish military launched a coup attempt aimed at toppling President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s government. The coup leaders, claiming to speak for the entire Turkish Armed Forces, said they\u2019d done so in the name of protecting democracy \u2014 despite the fact that Erdogan and his party were democratically elected. \u201dTurkish Armed Forces have completely taken over the administration of the country to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedom,\u201d the statement said. This may sound crazy to American ears, but it makes at least a little sense in the Turkish context.",
        "\u00d6mer Ta\u015fp\u0131nar is a nonresident senior fellow in Brookings Center on 21st Century Security and Intelligence and an expert on Turkey.

Ezra Klein: I know very little about Turkish politics. So how should I understand what is going on in the country right now? \u00d6mer Ta\u015fp\u0131nar: It\u2019s quite unexpected, even for those following Turkish politics. Erdogan appeared to be totally in charge.",
        "Friday evening\u2019s news of a coup attempt in Turkey has stunned the world. Almost nobody thought the Turkish military, or at least part of it, would attempt to overthrow President Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2014 and yet, it\u2019s happening. With such surprising news unfolding, and confusing and often conflicting information coming in real time, it can be hard to understand what\u2019s really happening. That\u2019s true on a factual level, which is why we\u2019re sorting through the latest developments over on our \u201dwhat we know\u201d post.",
        "Amid news of the coup attempt in Turkey, I reached Dani Rodrik, a Turkish economist and international development expert at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government. He was traveling in Spain but emailed answers to some of my (very basic) questions on the crisis. Here\u2019s our exchange. Ezra Klein: How, as someone who doesn\u2019t follow Turkish politics closely, should I understand what\u2019s going here? Dani Rodrik: The coup attempt is very puzzling. For one thing, it seems to have been very poorly planned.",
        "Late on Friday afternoon, military vehicles and troops swarmed the Turkish capital of Ankara and its most populous city, Istanbul. The country\u2019s prime minister, Binali Yildirim, has gone on television to announce that this is a coup attempt by at least some portion of the military against the current government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. A statement claiming to represent the Turkish armed forces claims to have seized control of the government. However, several hours later, a government spokesperson said the coup had been defeated.",
        "After a truck drove into a crowd of people in Nice, France, killing at least 84, Newt Gingrich seemed to escalate Donald Trump\u2019s calls for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, commenting on Fox News\u2019s Hannity Thursday that the United States should \u201dtest every person here who is of a Muslim background, and if they believe in Sharia, they should be deported.\u201d His comments were immediately criticized in the American media, prompting Gingrich to go on Facebook Live on Friday to clarify his statements, asserting that the news media was \u201dtrying to grossly exaggerate what I was",
        "Bernie Sanders\u2019s endorsement of Hillary Clinton marked the end of the single most successful socialist presidential campaign in American history. Sanders got 13. 1 million votes, or 4 percent of the US population. Even Eugene V. Debs in 1912, the previous mark for socialist presidential bids, only received 900, 000 votes, or 0. 9 percent of the US population. All of which raises the question: Where do American socialists go from here?",
        "Picture Donald Trump on a series of calls with advisers and heads of government from around the region, and inside the NATO alliance, devising a constructive response to a coup attempt in Turkey. Good luck. I\u2019m not someone who believes you need to understand the ins and outs of the relationship between Turkey\u2019s ruling party and the G\u00fclen Movement, or the history of relations in Turkey, or the details of Turkey\u2019s role in European Union policy toward refugees from Syria, to be a good president of the United States.",
        "I do not know how to explain what I just watched. It should be easy. Donald Trump introduced Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate. There it is. One sentence. Eleven words. But that doesn\u2019t explain what happened any better than \u201dI spent a few hours letting lysergic acid diethylamide mimic serotonin in my brain\u201d explains an acid trip. What just happened was weird, and it was important. Back in May, E. J."
