        "Leave it to an to explain a concept that many adults still struggle with. For a contest at his school in Atlanta back in May, Royce Mann read a slam poem about his \u201dwhite boy privilege.\u201d The whole thing is impressive not just because Mann manages to describe what it means to be privileged but because he does it with a type of clarity and nuance that\u2019s rarely seen in heated conversations about race. Perhaps the most illustrative line: \u201dI know it wasn\u2019t us white boys who created this system, but we profit from it every day.",
        "There are plenty of people in Washington, DC, advocating on behalf of corporate industries, or universities, or the idiosyncratic interests of wealthy donors. A much smaller number spent their days monomaniacally focused on addressing the needs of the poor. But among the latter is Robert Greenstein, president and founder of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Since 1981, Greenstein and his team have been at the center of countless debates over food stamps, welfare reform, housing assistance, the earned income tax credit, Medicaid, and more.",
        "The apparently failed coup against President Erdo\u011fan of Turkey continued to unfold Saturday morning, in what remains a very uncertain and fluid situation. Friday night, during the most chaotic sequence of events, Erdo\u011fan gave an interview via a video chat service on his iPhone, where he asserted the legitimacy of his government\u2019s authority and called on the Turkish people to take to the streets against the coup. The picture of him talking via Facetime is already one of the iconic images of the night.",
        "Pok\u00e9mon Go is a massive cultural phenomenon. If you don\u2019t believe it, just watch the video above, taken by Woodzys in New York City\u2019s Central Park, showing the madness that broke out when a Vaporeon spawned. Literally hundreds of people descended on the area, moving in a massive crowd, just to catch the elusive Pok\u00e9mon. In fairness, Vaporeon is pretty awesome: Still, this is simply not something you typically see with video games. So why are people so into this game?",
        "The Cleveland police union is calling for Ohio Gov. John Kasich to suspend Ohio\u2019s open carry law for the Republican National Convention in the wake of the shooting in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Sunday that killed three police officers and left several others wounded. \u201dWe are sending a letter to Gov. Kasich requesting assistance from him,\u201d Stephen Loomis, the president of the Cleveland Police Patrolmen\u2019s Association, told CNN. \u201dHe could very easily do some kind of executive order or something \u2014 I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s constitutional or not at this point.",
        "Gavin Long, 29, a former marine, opened fire on multiple law enforcement officials Sunday morning in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, local news outlets are reporting. According to ABC affiliate WBRZ, a gunman, face covered and wearing black, opened fire across from Hammond Aire Plaza, a local shopping center, at 9 am. Six officers were shot. Three of the officers were killed: Baton Rouge police officer Montrell Jackson; Officer Matthew Gerald; Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Brad Garafola. At a Monday press conference, Gov.",
        "This image makes me feel so incredibly small. Each of these 48, 741 dots represents a galaxy. Each galaxy is a collection of billions of stars. The stars themselves trap untold planets, asteroids, and possibly even life in their gravitational clutches. But this image, which is just of the night sky, is a mere pinprick of a window into the universe. The universe is thought to be 93 billion wide. The width of this image is 6 billion .",
        "When masses of people from around the world descend on a city for the Olympics, public health experts get a bit jittery. It\u2019s easy to understand why: Thousands of tourists cramped into stadiums and bars inevitably swap bacteria and viruses. In the past, this has led to outbreaks of measles and norovirus. This year, an extra layer of anxiety has shrouded the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro: Host country Brazil is a hot zone for a Zika virus epidemic that has now reached more than 60 countries.",
        "Fourteen years ago, when Taylor Swift was just 12, a woman named Whitney Houston asked for the receipts. It was a simple request. Journalist Diane Sawyer had asked Houston to comment on an alleged $730, 000 drug problem. \u201dI wanna see the receipts.\u201d Houston calmly replied, daring Sawyer to come up with an itemized list of purchases from Houston\u2019s alleged dealer. She repeated: \u201dI wanna see the receipts.\u201d The logic: No matter how off Houston might have seemed at the time, she wanted to see proof that she was consuming enough illegal substances to pay for a Manhattan apartment.",
        "On Sunday night, Donald Trump and Mike Pence sat down with 60 Minutes\u2019 Lesley Stahl for their first joint interview. It got weird quickly. \u201dYou said you would declare war against ISIS,\u201d Stahl asked Trump. \u201dWhat exactly do you have \u2014 \u201d I assume Stahl would have finished the question with \u201din mind.\u201d But Trump jumped in. He was ready, or seemed to be. \u201dIt is war!\u201d He interjected. Stahl, too, was prepared. \u201dWhen you say, \u2018declare war,\u2019 do you want to send American troops in there?\u201d she asked. Well, no, he apparently didn\u2019t mean that.",
        "Where Donald Trump goes, all too often, violence follows. America has seen increased civil unrest over the past few months \u2014 inspiring comparisons to the widespread rioting and police violence of 1968. Trump himself has encouraged his supporters to be violent at times. But increasingly over the past few months, he hasn\u2019t even had to: His rallies have become a magnet for people (on both left and right) who are quick to violence.",
        "After four months of primary voting, and one year after Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president of the United States, the Republican National Committee\u2019s convention is underway. Trump and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence have been declared the official Republican presidential and vice presidential nominees. The theme: Make America Great Again. For four days, from July 18 to 21, Republican politicians, journalists, protesters, and the like will descend on Cleveland to ring in the nomination. Trump\u2019s children Tiffany Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump, as well as Republican officials like House Speaker Paul Ryan, and Sen.",
        "What I\u2019m about to say is going to sound like a bad review of Netflix\u2019s new horror drama Stranger Things, whose first season follows the adventures of kids in and around a small town where strange things happen. Rating 4 The acting is of variable quality; it occasionally feels like even the great Winona Ryder is playing less of a character and more of a stereotypical harried, worried mother. The writing is often painfully on the nose.",
        "Watching a person die from cardiac arrest in an intensive care unit is devastating. It\u2019s especially so when the person is a woman in her 40s who has been smothered to death by her own weight \u2014 and we doctors can do nothing to save her. This patient, who was at a county hospital in Georgia where I was working, had respiratory failure caused by obesity hypoventilation syndrome, a breathing disorder. It was just the tip of the iceberg of her medical problems.",
        "So it\u2019s official: Donald J. Trump is the Republican nominee for president in 2016. There\u2019s no \u201dpresumptive\u201d about it anymore; the delegates have voted and made it official. That was probably the biggest news of the Republican National Convention\u2019s second night, but once the actual business of the event was out of the way, the focus was on jobs and family.",
        "I make it very clear on the first day of class: If a student uses more than four words in a row written by someone else, those words need to be cited. That goes for essays, online responses, PowerPoint presentations, group presentations, and, yes, even a speech. The rule is simple, but I struggle with the proper punishment. Obviously there\u2019s a question of proportion. An entire essay copied wholesale receives an automatic F, which might cost a student the class if it\u2019s a midterm or a final.",
        "On the second night of the Republican National Convention, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia went onstage and railed against Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201d agenda.\u201d Her kicker: \u201dI weep for the fabric of my state.\u201d Capito is right that West Virginia\u2019s coal industry is collapsing and mining jobs are vanishing and it\u2019s genuinely hurting the state. She\u2019s also right that the industry will likely keep shrinking under Clinton, who plans to tackle global warming by further curtailing America\u2019s coal use in favor of cleaner energy sources.",
        "Pikachu and Joe Biden don\u2019t have a whole lot in common. One is an electric mouse that paralyzes prey with thunder bolts; the other is a silver fox who melts hearts with a smile. One was born in 1996; the other in 1942. One battles Bulbasaurs and Zubats; the other negotiates federal spending levels with cranky senators. But the biggest difference between Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s and America\u2019s vice president may be their recognizability among the country\u2019s younger generation.",
        "Both the first and final nights of the Republican National Convention made it abundantly clear that the party is on unifying in opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement.",
        "Welcome to Dear Julia, a column where readers submit everyday health questions. Which painkillers work best? Is it better to run or walk for exercise? Julia Belluz sifts through the research and consults with experts in the field to figure out how science can help us live happier and healthier lives. Dear Julia: Which dietary supplements can I trust? Let me be clear: I\u2019m not a fan of supplements. After writing about them for the past several years, I have come think they should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.",
        "As the second night of the Republican National Convention ended, Twitter erupted at the news that Donald Trump Jr. \u2019s speech might also have been plagiarized, just like his stepmother Melania\u2019s speech on night one. In this case, the original source was F. H. Buckley, a law professor at George Mason University who writes for the American Conservative: pic. twitter. \u2014 The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) July 20, 2016 But it was a false alarm. \u201dI was a principal speechwriter for the speech,\u201d Buckley told Vox.",
        "At a typical convention, the party picks a nominee and then people give speeches about why you should vote for that nominee. For all the weirdness of the Trump convention, that basic dynamic held for the first two days of the 2016 Republican National Convention. Then Ted Cruz brought it all crashing down with a speech that pointedly didn\u2019t endorse Trump. Instead, he talked about conservative principles, fidelity to the Constitution, and the need to vote your conscience. He got booed \u2014 and managed to create a moment weirder than a Newt Gingrich speech.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 During Ted Cruz\u2019s speech at the Republican convention Wednesday night, he conspicuously refused to endorse Donald Trump for president \u2014 and attendees were furious. \u201dI congratulate Donald Trump on winning the nomination last night,\u201d Cruz said at the outset of his speech. \u201dAnd like each of you, I want to see the principles that our party believes prevail in November.\u201d He never mentioned Trump\u2019s name again. And for a while, his speech \u2014 which laid out the principles he personally believed in \u2014 was very .",
        "As a fun, mild action movie, the new Ghostbusters is a highly unlikely candidate to become a cultural game changer. But as one of the first action movies ever to sport an headlining cast, the franchise reboot has become one of the most controversial films of the year. Now the movie has inadvertently contributed to Twitter taking a major step in its efforts to combat harassment: the banning of hero Milo Yiannopoulos from the platform. Related Milo Yiannopoulos: Breitbart\u2019s star provocateur, Gamergater, and Trump champion, explained Tuesday night, Twitter permanently suspended Yiannopoulos from the website.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 The first sign that something was wrong came when Sen. Ted Cruz told the crowd not to stay home, to go to the polls, and to vote their conscience. That\u2019s when the Quicken Loans Arena \u2014 which was finally crowded and energized after two sleepy primetime evenings \u2014 started to get restless.",
        "If you happen to be a Republican Party member of Congress it would be really convenient to believe that Ross Douthat, Erik Erickson, Rich Lowry, Jay Nordlinger, David Frum, and all the other conservative writers and intellectuals horrified by Donald Trump are mistaken. It would be nice to believe that Trump, while maybe not the strongest candidate the GOP could field, is at least okay. And most of all, it would be nice to believe that Trump, while maybe not the ideal president from a policy viewpoint, would at least do a pretty good job.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 The Trump campaign has made nearly a half a dozen excuses for why Melania Trump sounded awfully like Michelle Obama last night, but one excuse has spread among the delegates in the Quicken Loans Arena like norovirus in the California delegation: Whatever you might think, Michelle Obama did not invent the English language. The Donald Trump campaign spent most of Tuesday morning doing everything other than the obvious political move of admitting a mistake, throwing a speechwriter under the bus, and moving on.",
        "Republicans and Democrats alike are vying to lead America\u2019s future this year as President Barack Obama concludes his second term in the White House. But a couple of new selfies with congressional interns suggest one party at least looks more like the America it\u2019s hoping to lead. Here\u2019s a selfie taken by House Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) that he posted on Instagram last Saturday with Capitol Hill interns: I think this sets a record for the most number of #CapitolHill interns in a single selfie. #SpeakerSelfie.",
        "When Donald Trump threatened millions of unauthorized immigrants with deportation on Wednesday night, he turned to a phrase he\u2019s used time and again during his campaign: \u201dAmerica First.\u201d \u201dWe need a system that serves our needs, not the needs of others,\u201d he said Wednesday night. \u201dRemember, under a Trump administration it\u2019s called America first. Remember that.\u201d For students of history, that\u2019s more than just an anodyne slogan. It also happens to be a phrase with a long, sordid backstory in US politics \u2014 and one that Donald Trump has somewhat strangely adopted during his campaign.",
        "Well \u2026 Donald Trump delivered quite the speech. The newly official Republican nominee for president ended the fourth and final night of the 2016 Republican National Convention with one of the darkest, most foreboding, and aggressively fearmongering speeches in modern political memory. It was unapologetically nationalistic, revived the rhetoric of organizations from the America First Committee to the 1968 Nixon campaign, and moderated none of Trump\u2019s most contentious policies."
