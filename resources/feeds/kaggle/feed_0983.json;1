        "Donald Trump is not a candidate the American people would turn to in normal times. He\u2019s too inexperienced, too eccentric, too volatile, too risky. Voting Trump is burning down the house to collect the insurance money \u2014 you don\u2019t do it unless things are really, really bad. Here is Trump\u2019s problem: Things are not really, really bad. In fact, things are doing much better than when President Obama came into office. Unemployment is 4.",
        "So much has been written and said about Donald Trump\u2019s manifest unfitness for office that at this point there\u2019s hardly any reason to dwell further on it. But a national convention isn\u2019t just about a single candidate. It\u2019s about an entire political party coming together.",
        "Donald Trump does not exactly have a record in public office that can be used to assess his likely performance going forward. Nor does he really have a policy platform in a traditional sense. What he does is speak. A lot. Trump\u2019s words \u2014 at rallies, on television shows, and in press conferences \u2014 have been the alpha and omega of his campaign. And his nomination acceptance speech, delivered Thursday night in Cleveland, is the biggest, most important speech he\u2019s given yet.",
        "Former Attorney General Eric Holder made a claim at the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday that may surprise most Americans: \u201dDespite the fiction and fearmongering you\u2019ve heard from the other party\u2019s nominee, violent crime has gone down since President Obama took office.\u201d Holder was referring to Donald Trump\u2019s big speech at the Republican National Convention last Thursday, in which the Republican nominee described a very dangerous America that simply doesn\u2019t exist.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 At his speech on Thursday at the 2016 Republican National Convention, Donald Trump supporter and Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel made a declaration that would seem nearly boring in liberal circles: He declared that he\u2019s proudly gay. But at the Republican convention, this can be risky \u2014 Republicans, after all, aren\u2019t known for their warmth to LGBTQ people. But when Thiel said he was gay, the crowd applauded. Now, the big applause came after he said that he\u2019s also a Republican and an American. But it\u2019s still something, I guess.",
        "If you were going to groom a member of the Trump family for politics, your first instinct wouldn\u2019t necessarily be to pick Donald Trump \u2014 a with outrageous wealth and a penchant for saying outrageously racist things. You might pick Ivanka Trump: his glamorous, accomplished, daughter, who is more disciplined and on her worst day than her father on his best. So perhaps it shouldn\u2019t be shocking that Ivanka\u2019s political star has quietly been on the rise over the past year. Before Donald Trump selected Indiana Gov.",
        "As you go out into the world of Pok\u00e9mon Go, you may be wondering what Pok\u00e9mon you should be looking for. Thankfully, I\u2019m here to help.

You can find something closer to that at Smogon, the competitive Pok\u00e9mon website, for the handheld games.",
        "North Miami, Florida, police officers shot an unarmed black man as he reportedly held his hands up in the air while lying on the ground. The victim, therapist Charles Kinsey, was apparently helping an autistic patient on whom someone called 911 prior to the shooting. Local station WSVN released a cellphone recording of the moments before the shooting on Wednesday evening. \u201dI\u2019m like this right here,\u201d Kinsey recounted to WSVN, with his arms in the air. \u201dAnd when he shot me, it was so surprising. I thought it was a mosquito bite.",
        "When Ted Cruz slickly evaded endorsing Donald Trump for president \u2014 live from the stage of the Republican National Convention, no less! \u2014 he beat Trump at his own game. Trump\u2019s rise in the summer of 2015 was predicated largely on understanding the power of certain reality television tropes and playing them up for the audience, which loves the genre. (Among others, Duck Dynasty and, yes, The Apprentice have generally played more strongly with Republicans than Democrats.) In particular, Trump played the villain. The guy who would say anything to win, no matter how outrageous.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate will be Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, who is exactly the person it seemed she would choose a month ago (or a year ago or, really, four years ago). It\u2019s all part of the thrilling trend of the Democratic race unfolding in a very predictable way, even amidst all the insanity of 2016. Unlike Donald Trump, who had major work to do in terms of unifying the Republican Party and has dozens of obvious political weaknesses to shore up, the political stakes for Clinton\u2019s pick were relatively low."
