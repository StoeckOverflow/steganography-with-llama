        "Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton\u2019s vice presidential running mate, has not been in the Senate very long, having first been elected in 2012. But he\u2019s already made congressional history. In June 2013, mere months after taking office, he became the first senator to ever deliver an entire speech in Spanish \u2014 or, indeed, to do so in any language besides English. You can watch the speech above, or read it on Kaine\u2019s Senate page here. It is a long argument for comprehensive immigration reform as proposed by the bipartisan Gang of Eight.",
        "Three years after the Black Lives Matter movement began, not everyone understands the movement\u2019s mission. And as evidenced during the Republican National Convention, some people, like Donald Trump, are invested in exploiting those misunderstandings for political points. But the fire Trump is igniting is fueled by a country that has historically resisted black social justice movements. According to the American National Election Studies, 57 percent of Americans in 1964 said most of black people\u2019s actions during the civil rights movement in the most recent year were violent.",
        "BoJack Horseman is the reason I love television. Okay, maybe not literally \u2014 the first show I ever fell in love with was Nickelodeon\u2019s Hey Arnold! when I was barely older than its elementary school heroes. But when people ask me why TV is my medium of choice, I inevitably point to imaginative and singular shows like BoJack. Rating 4. 5 Netflix\u2019s animated series \u2014 which released its third season on July 22 \u2014 is wickedly funny and frequently devastating.",
        "Many progressives weren\u2019t particularly thrilled when Hillary Clinton picked Tim Kaine as her running mate. They questioned his stances on things like bank regulation and the Partnership, and they were unhappy that Kaine personally opposes abortion. Kaine\u2019s position on abortion is a bit complicated, though. He has said, and still says, that he personally opposes abortion as a Catholic. He has also supported or voted for abortion restrictions in the past \u2014 including during his stint as Virginia\u2019s governor.",
        "Hackers have released a trove of 20, 000 emails stolen from the servers of the Democratic National Committee. Most of the emails showed routine campaign planning among senior DNC officials. The emails show some evidence of unseemly behavior by Democratic Party officials and at least one case where DNC officials discussed trying to undermine the Sanders. That has reopened a debate about whether the DNC \u2014 which is supposed to be neutral during a primary campaign \u2014 was too favorable toward Hillary Clinton. Perhaps as important as the emails\u2019 content is who may have leaked them.",
        "A few hours before Hillary Clinton announced Tim Kaine would be her running mate, I had an interesting conversation with Stuart Stevens, Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign manager. The topic was Donald Trump. These days, the topic is always Donald Trump. But Stevens\u2019s analysis of the election offered a useful window into why Clinton chose Kaine. \u201dTrump is 4 points behind Romney with white men,\u201d he said. \u201dHe\u2019s 11 points behind with white women. The electorate is white men, white women, nonwhite men, and nonwhite women.",
        "It was when I saw Ghostbusters for the second time that I realized I could love it no matter what. After months of anticipation for the reboot, exhaustive research on the controversy that had surrounded the film almost since its inception, and slowly deflating expectations, I finally got to see the movie a week before it came out. I thought it was fine. I wandered out of the theater, shrugged away my popcorn, and wrote a lukewarm review \u2014 albeit through gritted teeth.",
        "Every Sunday, we pick a new episode of the week. It could be good. It could be bad. It will always be interesting. You can read the archives here. The episode of the week for July 17 through July 23 is \u201dMemory of Tomorrow,\u201d the second season finale of Syfy\u2019s 12 Monkeys. 12 Monkeys, Syfy\u2019s TV riff on the classic 1995 movie, sometimes feels like an opera thrown together on a budget scrounged from the \u201dLeave a penny; take a penny\u201d dishes of this great nation\u2019s convenience stores. The show\u2019s ambitions are huge.",
        "Update: DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz announced Sunday that she will resign at the end of the convention. This week\u2019s Democratic National Convention is set to feature some of the party\u2019s most prominent advocates \u2014 President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Cory Booker, Fergie and Lena Dunham. Notably absent from the list, however, is one name that has divided Democrats perhaps more than any other: Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, one of the leaders in the Democratic Party.",
        "To many on the left, Tim Kaine\u2019s selection as the Democratic vice presidential nominee was disappointing more for who Kaine isn\u2019t than for who he is. Kaine beat out Juli\u00e1n Castro and Tom Perez, either one of whom would\u2019ve been the first Hispanic person on a national ticket ever. He beat out his Senate colleague Cory Booker, who\u2019d be the first black VP pick and only the second black politician on a national ticket.",
        "Lights Out, the new horror movie about a monster that can only strike when, well, the lights are out, is a near masterpiece of scary movie craft. Rating 4 There are sequences in this film that left the audience at my screening joyfully applauding their creativity and audacity. And the movie\u2019s central metaphor \u2014 the monster is depression! \u2014 is surprisingly durable, allowing for some great character moments. Yes, it has problems \u2014 one big one in particular.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s choice of Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine to be her running mate hasn\u2019t exactly set the world on fire, but overall it\u2019s been more than not. Kaine is in the political world, has executive experience, and has become a leading foreign policy voice in the Senate.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention Thursday night painted America as a dangerous hellscape, besieged by criminals, terrorists, and killer immigrants. And in this dystopia, Trump offered himself as the savior. \u201dI will restore law and order to our country,\u201d he proclaimed. \u201dI am the law and order candidate.\u201d Many saw echoes of Richard Nixon\u2019s RNC acceptance speech 48 years ago, which laid forth a similarly chaotic vision of our country: \u201dAs we look at America, we see cities enveloped in smoke and flame,\u201d he said.",
        "The third and at long last final general election presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will take place on Wednesday, October 19. The debate, which is in Las Vegas, Nevada, will last 90 minutes and be moderated by Fox News\u2019s Chris Wallace.",
        "President Donald Trump said at a Thursday news conference, when asked about possible in his administration, that he\u2019s \u201dthe least racist person.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time Trump made this claim, previously telling reporters that he\u2019s \u201dthe least racist person that you\u2019ve ever encountered.\u201d But Trump\u2019s record tells a very different story.",
        "CLEVELAND \u2014 Avik Roy is a Republican\u2019s Republican. A health care wonk and editor at Forbes, he has worked for three Republican presidential hopefuls \u2014 Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, and Marco Rubio. Much of his adult life has been dedicated to advancing the Republican Party and conservative ideals. But when I caught up with Roy at a bar just outside the Republican convention, he said something I\u2019ve never heard from an establishment conservative before: The Grand Old Party is going to die.",
        "Three pints of India pale ale can deliver you half a day\u2019s worth of calories. And a typical glass of California cabernet sauvignon today may have more alcohol and more calories than it would have a decade ago. But you\u2019d never know it. Unlike companies that make food, brewers, distillers, and winemakers aren\u2019t required to disclose calories and ingredients on their cans and bottles. (They\u2019ve lobbied against it for years.) And survey data has shown that very few people have any idea what\u2019s in their boozy beverages of choice. The public health community has pushed hard to change that.",
        "One of the most important companies of the first boom, Yahoo, has reached the end of its life as an independent company. Yahoo\u2019s board approved the sale of Yahoo\u2019s core business to Verizon in a deal valued at $4. 8 billion. The company\u2019s shareholders and regulators must still approve the deal \u2014 the companies expect it to close in early 2017. The deal represents a stunning decline for a company that was valued at more than $100 billion at its 2000 peak.",
        "On Monday morning, it happened again: There was a mass shooting at a Florida nightclub. The shooting this time was reportedly at an event for teens, killing at least two teenagers and wounding at least 19 people. The victims ranged in age from 12 to 27. Details of the attack are still early and developing. But here\u2019s what we know and don\u2019t know, based on information released in news reports and by law enforcement so far.",
        "As we head into the Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton is maintaining a lead over Donald Trump nationally and in key swing states. While she is currently favored to win, the risk she could lose is real \u2014 her lead is only on par with where John Kerry was at this point in 2004. It raises the question: Where would the Democrats be right now if they hadn\u2019t nominated such a deeply unpopular nominee to go up against Trump?",
        "It\u2019s official: Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee for president in 2016, the first woman to win the nomination of either major party in all of American history. Even though the outcome was foreordained, it was still an emotional moment. It a culmination of the work of campaigns from Victoria Woodhull in 1872 to Belva Ann Lockwood in 1884 to Margaret Chase Smith in 1952 to Shirley Chisholm and Patsy Mink in 1972 to Pat Schroeder in 1988 to Elizabeth Dole in 2000 to Clinton herself in 2008.",
        "\u201dActually doing the work is hard,\u201d Bill Clinton said. \u201dYou know, it\u2019s hard, and some people think it\u2019s boring.\u201d That was the key thesis of his long, rambling, strangely compelling speech about his wife Tuesday night. All day, leaks suggested that Clinton was going to give a very personal speech about Hillary Clinton, rather than a wonky, one. And it wasn\u2019t a crazy idea. That, after all, is what the nominee\u2019s spouse normally does. And Bill is Hillary\u2019s spouse. But I didn\u2019t believe he would do it. And of course he didn\u2019t do it.",
        "Donald Trump loves bragging about bringing in yuuuge ratings. Back in his campaign\u2019s infancy, it was one of his favorite talking points. \u201dThere\u2019d be a major collapse of the race, and there\u2019d be a major collapse of television ratings\u201d if he weren\u2019t in the race, Trump told the New York Times. \u201dIt would become a depression in television.\u201d Well, Trump might be disappointed to find out that the ratings are in for the first and second days of the Republican and Democratic conventions \u2014 and he lost.",
        "Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is one of America\u2019s most respected, most famous elder statespeople. So you\u2019d think her speech on the second night of the Democratic National Convention endorsing Hillary Clinton would be pretty compelling stuff. But it wasn\u2019t. And that should trouble Democrats. To get a flavor of the speech, just read this paragraph. Luxuriate in its mediocrity. Bathe in its clich\u00e9s: When Hillary served as secretary of state, I watched her partner with President Obama to restore our country\u2019s reputation around the world.",
        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Michael Sparks was so revolted by the idea of seeing Bernie Sanders endorse Hillary Clinton two weeks ago that he had to go to the gym to watch the speech. \u201dI thought if I was on the treadmill I might not have a complete breakdown when he did it,\u201d said Sparks, 43, a Sanders fan from Indianapolis. It didn\u2019t work. \u201dI raged and cried the entire day,\u201d said Sparks, who has a tattoo of Sanders on his left bicep. \u201dIt mortified me.",
        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Bill Clinton has attended every Democratic National Convention since 1972. He\u2019s been a heavily featured speaker at every single one since his 1988 keynote address. He was a symbol of party unity in 2008, and he brought the house down as the \u201dexplainer in chief\u201d in 2012 who defended the of Barack Obama\u2019s policies even better than the president himself. The former president is a genuine star in the Democratic Party \u2014 first as a symbol of youth, then of power, then simply of charisma and political success, and then of unity.",
        "Every week, critic at large Todd VanDerWerff and culture writer Caroline Framke get together to talk about Lifetime\u2019s splashy scripted drama UnReal. This week, we\u2019re talking about \u201dFugitive,\u201d the eighth episode of the second season. You can catch up our previous coverage of the series here, discuss this week\u2019s episode in the comments below. Caroline Framke: After \u201dAmbush,\u201d last week\u2019s bizarre and exploitative episode \u2014 which I can\u2019t even say was \u201dabout police brutality,\u201d since Romeo getting shot just ended up being a sidebar \u2014 I was really hoping UnReal could take a deep breath and steady itself.",
        "Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t just put cracks in the glass ceiling tonight. She shattered it. Whatever your politics, that is a momentous moment that will go down in history books. At this point in the election \u2014 at this point in Clinton\u2019s career \u2014 it\u2019s easy to see her nomination as expected and obvious. She was the frontrunner for the Democrats from the moment the primary season began. Related How I came to realize a woman president was a huge deal. I\u2019m 31, and she has been a household name in American politics for most of my life.",
        "Every great speech has a moment. In Michelle Obama\u2019s speech before the Democratic National Convention, it was this, where she talks about her place in history as the first black mother in the White House: [This] is the story that has brought me to this stage tonight. The story of generations of people who felt the lash of bondage, the shame of servitude, the sting of segregation, but who kept on striving and hoping and doing what needed to be done \u2014 so that today I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves.",
        "It\u2019s clear that a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which affects around 5. 4 million Americans, is still a long way off. But new findings suggest we may be getting closer to knowing how to prevent the devastating neurodegenerative disease. On Sunday, results from a promising trial involving nearly 3, 000 older adults were announced at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association International Conference in Toronto. The trial found that a specific type of computerized brain training game that tests mental quickness decreased the onset of dementia by 48 percent compared with controls."
