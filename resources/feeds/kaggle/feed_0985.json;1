        "On a normal convention night, either the sitting vice president or the newly named VP nominee would headline. When Mike Pence spoke in Cleveland last week, he was the main attraction, not the opener. But the Democrats had a lot to fit into four days. And so Joe Biden and Tim Kaine \u2014 not to mention former CIA House Chief of of Management and Budget director Leon Panetta, and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, California Gov.",
        "Hillary Clinton is the heavy favorite be elected president in November. If she makes it to the White House, it will confirm Barack Obama\u2019s status as one of the most consequential presidents in American history. Obama engineered a recovery from recession that, though slow to begin, is gaining strength in its seventh year rather than slowing. He\u2019s tackled climate change in an unprecedented way, brought health insurance to an unprecedented number of Americans even while slowing the growth of health care costs, and taken crucial steps to cut the financial sector down to size.",
        "In 2004, a Barack Obama stepped onto the stage at the Democratic National Convention and gave a speech that literally changed the course of American history. \u201dThere are those who are preparing to divide us,\u201d he said, \u201dthe spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Well, I say to them tonight, there\u2019s not a liberal America and a conservative America; there\u2019s the United States of America.\u201d That was the Obama who thrilled an unsuspecting nation. He didn\u2019t have a plan to heal the country. He had an argument that it wasn\u2019t really sick.",
        "Throughout the election, Democrats have had a pretty tough time figuring out a counter to Donald Trump\u2019s nostalgic nationalism. What, exactly, is the right response to \u201cMake America Great Again?\u201d At Wednesday\u2019s Democratic National Convention, Vice President Joe Biden showed them the way: Answer nationalism with patriotism. \u201cHe has no clue about what makes America great,\u201d Biden says. \u201cActually, he has no clue, period. \u201d Biden\u2019s speech was all about a positive, liberal spin on the American story. Biden\u2019s America is a land of opportunity, but only because people work together to help each other through tough times.",
        "Tim Kaine\u2019s big speech at the Democratic National Convention covered a lot of ground: Kaine\u2019s own background, a case for Hillary Clinton, and attacks on Donald Trump. But his speech had a bigger unifying theme: Kaine argued that the Democratic Party is now the true party of moral values, in contrast to a GOP led by candidate he called a \u201dmoral disaster.\u201d He tied together his faith and his political career, arguing that he, Clinton, and other Democrats are motivated primarily by a desire to do good and improve the world.",
        "Everyone is talking about Donald Trump\u2019s call for the Russian government to release emails it may have stolen from Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server. But that wasn\u2019t the most chilling thing Trump said in his rambling answer to a question about who hacked the email server of the Democratic National Committee. \u201dHonestly, I wish I had that power,\u201d Trump responded. \u201dI\u2019d love to have that power.\u201d The thing is, if Trump gets elected president, he probably will have the power to hack into the private communications of his political opponents. And that\u2019s terrifying.",
        "Pour yourself a cup of coffee and prepare to settle in for some fast talking, because I have some very exciting news for you: We finally know when Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life will debut \u2014 and we\u2019ve got the first peek at what it\u2019s going to look like. Related Gilmore Girls on Netflix: what you need to know about the revival Netflix has announced that its highly anticipated Gilmore Girls revival will premiere globally on Thanksgiving weekend: November 25, 2016, at 12:01 am Pacific.",
        "There was a moment in Bill Clinton\u2019s winding, loving, and occasionally weird convention speech about his wife that encapsulated how Hillary Clinton\u2019s admirers see her, and why they think so much of the criticism she gets is unfair. \u201dSpeeches like this are fun,\u201d said the former president, who clearly finds giving long, nationally televised speeches to be fun. \u201dActually doing the work is hard.\u201d That\u2019s the view Hillary Clinton\u2019s fans have of her. Hell, it\u2019s the view Hillary Clinton has of herself. She knows she doesn\u2019t give great speeches.",
        "Health officials have confirmed a small cluster of new, Zika cases in Miami Beach, as well as another in the Tampa area. This is important for one simple reason: It means more Zika cases are likely to pop up in the South soon. Zika was first confirmed in Florida\u2019s County on July 29, when a pregnant woman tested positive for the and sexually transmitted virus. Unlike all of the other Zika cases reported in the US at the time, she had no travel history to a country with Zika.",
        "Hillary Clinton has one job tonight: Deliver a speech. Unfortunately, it\u2019s just not a job that suits her talents. In a rational world, \u201drousing convention speech\u201d would be a job permanently bestowed on Barack Obama who, after all, got himself elected president largely on the strength of a rousing convention speech. Bill Clinton is very good at it, too. Joe Biden is good. Michelle Obama is great. Beyond the top ranks, Cory Booker shows a lot of promise. Nobody sensible would have watched Gavin Newsom in the early evening Wednesday, but he\u2019s really good, too.",
        "Update, August 23: Nearly a month after it was first discovered, the scientists still have no idea what the purple orb is! \u201cWe don\u2019t have a definitive identification yet,\u201d an Nautilus spokesperson says in an email. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting on further analysis from science teams. \u201d Deep under the sea, near the Channel Islands several miles off the coast of California, marine scientists noticed a glowing purple orb hiding in the shadows. They zoomed in on the creature with an underwater robot camera \u2014 and were completely mystified. They had never seen anything like this before.",
        "One of the unexpected consequences of Donald Trump\u2019s angry pessimism is that it has forced the GOP to cede some of its strongest themes to Democrats. Rich Lowry, the editor of National Review, noticed this during night three of the Democratic National Convention: American exceptionalism and greatness, shining city on hill, founding documents, \u2019re trying to take all our stuff \u2014 Rich Lowry (@RichLowry) July 28, 2016 It\u2019s usually the GOP that hammers away at family values, patriotism, and American exceptionalism.",
        "The road to getting a new pharmaceutical drug on the market is long and brutal. It begins with a novel compound that must first be tested in cells and then animals. This \u201d \u201d phase of drug development, which can last for several years, allows researchers to understand how potential therapies might work on different diseases and whether the drugs are likely to be safe or toxic in people. But for every 5, 000 compounds assessed at this stage, only about five are promising enough to even try in humans.",
        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign message may be, \u201dWe\u2019re stronger together,\u201d but certain pockets of the Democratic National Convention feel more like a parody of that slogan. Overshadowed by yet another email controversy, the Democratic Party is dealing with disgruntled factions who are disappointed Bernie Sanders isn\u2019t their nominee. Emboldened by damning emails showing favoritism toward Clinton, Sanders supporters have organized protests outside the convention, including a that forced reporters to remain inside a media pavilion at the Wells Fargo Center.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential nomination shatters a glass ceiling nearly as old as our nation itself. But over the course of Clinton\u2019s campaign, some black women have been both anxious and ambivalent about the prospect of Clinton as the first woman presidential candidate. And when Clinton finally clinched the nomination in June, Twitter user MadBlackThot created the hashtag #GirlIGuessImWithHer, which soon went viral. This meme captures the sentiment: mood. #GirlIGuessImWithHer pic. twitter. \u2014 Alisha Stewart (@AlishaNStewart) June 8, 2016 Sure, the memes are funny.",
        "What we just witnessed in Cleveland and Philadelphia defies our normal political vocabulary. We are used to speaking of American politics as split between the two major parties. It\u2019s Democrats versus Republicans, liberals versus conservatives, left versus right. But not this election. The conventions showed that this is something different. This campaign is not merely a choice between the Democratic and Republican parties, but between a normal political party and an abnormal one. The Democratic Party\u2019s convention was a normal political party\u2019s convention. The party nominated Hillary Clinton, a longtime party member with deep experience in government.",
        "That\u2019s a wrap, folks. After two straight weeks of primetime electioneering, the 2016 party convention season has come to an end, with Hillary Clinton wrapping up the Democratic event in Philadelphia with one of the strongest speeches she\u2019s given in her career. It was a long, multifaceted address that followed a carefully designed program which included some substantively interesting, if not always names. More than just about any other night of the convention, it was put together to send important signals about Clinton and the party\u2019s priorities, the constituencies they value, and what commitments they consider most important.",
        "With Zika moving through nearly every country in the Western Hemisphere over the past year and a half, it was only a matter of time before the virus made its way to the continental US. At the end of July, health officials announced that a handful of Zika infections had originated from mosquitoes in Miami, Florida. As of August 22, there were 37 cases in Florida, mostly concentrated in a one square mile area of Miami\u2019s Wynwood neighborhood. Zika was discovered in the 1940s, but most people had never heard of it until last year.",
        "I have found the nomination of a woman for president this week to be an emotional experience in ways I did not expect. And it\u2019s not just me \u2014 I heard from lots of people who didn\u2019t expect to cry during a roll call vote but all of a sudden found tears coming down their faces. I started asking people to tell me about it. Where were they? What happened? \u201dI wasn\u2019t sure how I\u2019d feel this week as I\u2019ve been lukewarm on Hillary in the past,\u201d Andrea Coleman told me. She\u2019s 35 and lives in Colorado.",
        "Partway through Hillary Clinton\u2019s speech accepting the Democratic nomination for president, she launched into a discussion of her reputation for caring about policy details. That may sound boring. But it wasn\u2019t. In a section that might be some of Clinton\u2019s best oratory ever, she managed to summarize the core of the case for her over Trump in one compelling, short paragraph. Here\u2019s what she said: It is true.",
        "One of nature\u2019s slowest, smelliest shows is underway right now in a small number of greenhouses: the blooming of the corpse flower. Over the next few days at the New York Botanical Garden, the United States Botanic Garden in Washington, DC, and Indiana University in Bloomington, these flowers will slowly unfurl, revealing a putrid maroon interior and a stench reminiscent of rotting flesh. Then they will collapse. And people will want to watch. In past years, 130, 000 visitors have come to see and smell the flower in Washington alone.",
        "Let\u2019s be honest: There\u2019s something that feels a little bit off about Hillary Clinton\u2019s historic nomination for president. And that something is Bill Clinton. There\u2019s this niggling sense that the fact that Clinton benefited too much from her husband\u2019s connections, that there\u2019s something shitty about electing a second Clinton shortly after electing a second Bush. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard someone say this, maybe a friend or a family member. It probably felt a little true to you. I know it felt a little true to me, the first few times I thought about Clinton\u2019s first run back in 2008.",
        "\u201dI come from the land where we manufacture Pez!\u201d J. R. Romano, chair of the Connecticut Republicans, bellowed before a packed auditorium. The sentiment came during the Republican National Convention\u2019s roll call, a process in which each state is supposed to orally cast its votes for the presidential primary candidates. But give an amateur politician a microphone and an audience of 24 million viewers, and, well, things change.",
        "The most emotional moment of the Democratic National Convention was the speech by Khizr Khan, the bereaved father of Army Captain Humayun Khan. With his wife Ghazala by his side, Khan recalled his son\u2019s character, his faith, his patriotism \u2014 and, ultimately, his courageous death in the service of the country he loved, and the fellow soldiers he was protecting. And, yes, the Khan family is Muslim. Under Trump\u2019s proposed policies, they would be innately suspect; had he been president when they immigrated to America, they would\u2019ve been barred from entering, and Humayun Khan never would have served.",
        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 I was there, in the arena of the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, when a woman accepted the nomination of a major American political party for president. But don\u2019t envy me for witnessing history, because that\u2019s not really how it felt. To people watching Hillary Clinton\u2019s Democratic National Convention speech on TV, like my colleague Dylan Matthews, \u201cThe first speech as nominee of the first woman nominated by a major party was always going to be a moment. And sure enough, Clinton delivered [. ..] She nailed it. \u201d She delivered the speech fluidly.",
        "When Michelle Obama addressed the significance of the first black First Family living in the White House, a house built by slaves, she was unintentionally giving a history lesson to many who didn\u2019t know this to be the case \u2014 and some who would wish to prove parts of her statement false. But it was the truth, even if conservative pundits like Bill O\u2019Reilly, for multiple nights in a row, argued that the slaves who built the presidential palace were, at the very least, \u201c\u201d ate \u201cmeat, bread and other staples,\u201d and had decent lodging.",
        "Every Sunday, we pick a new episode of the week. It could be good. It could be bad. It will always be interesting. You can read the archives here. The episode of the week for July 24 through July 30 is \u2014 this is true \u2014 \u201dSex, Lies, and Jellyfish,\u201d the sixth episode of the second season of CBS\u2019s Zoo. Have you met my friend Zoo? The CBS summer series about animals rising up en masse to take out the human population thanks to [nonsensical science term] and very possibly [vague mystical reference]?",
        "Today, Ghazala Khan published a Washington Post entitled, \u201dTrump criticized my silence. He knows nothing about true sacrifice.\u201d For Trump, it gets worse from there. Khan writes: I cannot walk into a room with pictures of Humayun. For all these years, I haven\u2019t been able to clean the closet where his things are \u2014 I had to ask my to do it. Walking onto the convention stage, with a huge picture of my son behind me, I could hardly control myself. What mother could? Donald Trump has children whom he loves.",
        "Hey, parents! Have your kids been asking one too many questions about the Necronomicon? Are you worried that your child might be making her way down to the seas each night to commune with the Great Old Ones? If you\u2019re a fan of H. P. Lovecraft, the horror writer whose legacy looms large over us all, and you\u2019re afraid the Elder Gods might be calling to your offspring, you\u2019re in luck. You can now teach them how to avoid the terrors of the deep with a beautifully illustrated, Lovecraftian alphabet book that\u2019s newly available as a free, downloadable PDF.",
        "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child has an impossible task. A continuation of J. K. Rowling\u2019s saga about a boy wizard, Cursed Child doesn\u2019t even have the luxury of being a full book, let alone a doorstopper like the later volumes in the series. No, Cursed Child is a play, written by Rowling in collaboration with John Tiffany and Jack Thorne, currently onstage in London. On this side of the Atlantic, it\u2019s available only as a scriptbook."
