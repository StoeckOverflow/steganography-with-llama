        "In the past several months, Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric toward Muslims in America has become increasingly extreme. He has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. He has insisted that American Muslims \u201dcheer\u201d and \u201dcelebrate\u201d terror attacks, that Muslim communities are known to harbor terrorists, and that Muslim assimilation in the United States is \u201dclose\u201d to \u201dnonexistent.\u201d Hillary Clinton has responded by attacking Trump\u2019s Islamophobia and his attempt to \u201ddemonize and declare war on an entire religion.\u201d But in her attempts to rebut Trump, experts say, Clinton has occasionally created an unsettling narrative of her own.",
        "At this point, HBO\u2019s ready for questions about Game of Thrones\u2019s filming schedule and diversity \u2014 but it apparently still gets blindsided by criticism of its dramas dependence on sexualized violence against women to propel plots. HBO kicked off its day at the Television Critics Association summer press tour on July 30 with a question and answer session with Casey Bloys, the network\u2019s new President of Programming.",
        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Every night of the Democratic National Convention, Pastor Ray Shawn McKinnon and his friend Sebastian stayed up talking well past 3 am in their Holiday Inn hotel room. The two met last summer volunteering for Bernie Sanders in North Carolina, and soon became close friends. McKinnon, who is black and 6\u20191\u201d calls Sebastian, who is white and 5\u20192\u201d his \u201d conscience.\u201d Over 14 months, they were inseparable allies: canvassing, and organizing for a common cause. But now they\u2019re at odds \u2014 and trying to make sense of it.",
        "For a lot of liberals, the refusal of major Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan and even frequent Trump critics like Sen. John McCain or the Bush family to endorse Hillary Clinton is a major character failing. It suggests that in the face of an unprecedentedly awful candidate, who imperils our NATO allies and argues for flagrantly racist policies and attacks the families of fallen soldiers, they care more about partisanship than what\u2019s best for the country. They\u2019re willing to elect a bigoted demagogue if that\u2019s what it takes to get tax cuts.",
        "President Barack Obama didn\u2019t hesitate to use a little hyperbole in making the case for Hillary Clinton during the convention: \u201dThere has never been a man or a woman, not me, not Bill, nobody more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States of America,\u201d he said. Then, in a joking aside: \u201dI hope you don\u2019t mind, Bill, but I was just telling the truth, man.\u201d It\u2019s true Clinton has more foreign policy experience than most recent nominees. She\u2019s far more politically experienced than Obama was.",
        "After a busy July, the streaming world slows down a bit in August \u2014 as does seemingly everything else. There are fewer original programming debuts and fewer big exclusives, as both the film and TV worlds take deep breaths before the start of Oscar season and fall TV in the months ahead. But there\u2019s still plenty of good stuff to check out, especially if you\u2019re willing to venture off the beaten path. This month, look out for rapping teenagers on Netflix, grown men drinking wine on Hulu, and lots more.",
        "\u201dThe Art of War\u201d is a hugely pivotal episode of The Night Of. Coming at the season\u2019s exact midpoint \u2014 it\u2019s episode four of eight \u2014 \u201dThe Art of War\u201d needs to signal the pivot from the initial investigation to the trial that will determine Naz\u2019s fate. But it also needs to deal with the fact that a young man in Naz\u2019s situation \u2014 seemingly an obvious murder suspect, but with enough loose ends to his case to suggest the possibility he won\u2019t be convicted \u2014 would probably be offered some sort of plea deal.",
        "To explain why the UK voted to leave the European Union, commentators have zeroed in on four potential reasons: fear of immigrants, voter dissatisfaction with a weak economy or the status quo, loss of national autonomy, and age. The first three explanations are intuitively powerful, but they seem to be contradicted by a whole host of evidence. The fourth \u2014 age \u2014 is quantitatively persuasive, but it still leaves us searching for a story about how affects opinion.",
        "This could end badly. Every time Donald Trump starts slipping in the polls, he starts intimating to his followers that there\u2019s a conspiracy to rig the election \u2014 and a win for Hillary Clinton will be proof that it worked. He first confessed to being \u201dafraid the election\u2019s gonna be rigged\u201d in August.",
        "Studies consistently find that people with more education tend to live longer. But scientists aren\u2019t exactly sure why. One explanation could be that they\u2019re richer and thus have more money to invest in their health. Or maybe there\u2019s just something intrinsically special about people who stay in school longer. Perhaps they\u2019re smarter, more resilient. Those qualities could easily help them live longer, healthier lives. But that isn\u2019t a satisfying answer because we \u2014 mostly \u2014 can\u2019t control our genes and the environments we\u2019re born into. There\u2019s another hypothesis for why school may yield longer lives.",
        "Consider, if you will, two basic facts about clean energy in the United States. Nuclear power is the country\u2019s largest source of energy, supplying about 19 percent of our electricity, but it\u2019s barely growing. Wind and solar are smaller, at about 8 percent, but they\u2019re growing much more rapidly. Put those together, and you get an intuitive blueprint for reducing US carbon dioxide emissions: Protect the nuclear base, and then scale up wind and solar on top of that, displacing fossil fuels as you go. Seems reasonable, no? Yet, oddly enough, many states have struggled with this simple concept.",
        "The growth of the US economy keeps falling short of expectations. On Friday, we learned that the US economy grew at an rate of 1 percent in the first half of 2016. That\u2019s the slowest growth rate since 2012, and it continues the slow growth that has characterized the recovery since 2009. The weakness of the recovery has been surprising because conventional economic theory says that the bigger an economic downturn is, the bigger the subsequent boom will be. And the 2009 recession was the worst in decades, so growth should have been massive.",
        "Okay, it\u2019s time. To the dismay of my Vox colleagues and most other people I\u2019ve discussed the matter with, I maintain that the first Bourne movie \u2014 2002\u2019s The Bourne Identity, the one Paul Greengrass didn\u2019t direct \u2014 is, despite its flaws, the best of the bunch. All the subsequent Bourne movies have gone downhill \u2014 and that\u2019s not even counting the lamentable Legacy with Jeremy Renner. This weekend, I saw the latest installment, Jason Bourne. It is a joyless, derivative, hectic nothingburger.",
        "Three months out, Donald Trump has already started warning people the election in November might be \u201drigged\u201d for Hillary Clinton, telling Republican voters to \u201dwatch very closely.\u201d Speaking with Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity Monday, Trump insinuated President Barack Obama beat Mitt Romney in 2012 in fixed election, said his own primary win was rigged \u201da little bit,\u201d that Clinton beat Bernie Sanders in a \u201drigged\u201d primary, and that Democrats would attempt to rig the 2016 election for Clinton. \u201dI\u2019m telling you, November 8th, we\u2019d better be careful because that election is going to be rigged,\u201d Trump said.",
        "All year, Republicans have been trying to convince themselves that Donald Trump would pivot to the general election once he got the nomination \u2014 cleaning up his act, professionalizing his campaign, and making appeals beyond his base. In his first two weeks after the Republican National Convention, he\u2019s basically done the exact opposite. In late July, the day after grabbing the nomination, Trump went on a rant about Ted Cruz, reviving his bizarre accusation that Cruz\u2019s father might\u2019ve been involved in killing JFK. From there, things only got worse.",
        "The convention season is arguably the most crucial period for the presidential election. Historically, it\u2019s one of the very few points in the contest in which polls tend to dramatically shift in a way that proves durable. Whichever candidate comes out on top when the dust settles is more likely to actually win in November. So far \u2014 though it\u2019s still early \u2014 things look like they went very well indeed for Hillary Clinton. The question is whether it will stay that way.",
        "The head of the Republican National Committee is \u201capoplectic\u201d with Donald Trump. Senior party officials are \u201cfrustrated \u2014 and confused \u2014 by Donald Trump\u2019s erratic behavior. \u201d Even Trump\u2019s ally Newt Gingrich says that he\u2019s being \u201cvery . \u201d Republicans have good reason to be upset.",
        "We are walking hand in hand, her small palm nestled snugly into my own, its weight a comfort I have come to take for granted. When she was born, I spent hours gazing at that palm, my eyes tracing the path of the crease that ran from one side to the other, the crease I could not find on my own upturned hand, the crease that served as one more \u201dmarker\u201d for the doctors.",
        "It is pretty that Marilyn Monroe was a size 12. However, in modern times she could fit into anything between a 4 and a 10. These gaps in numbers alone demonstrate how confusing and frustrating our sizing system is. To actually document the inconsistencies, I went out to SoHo and bought jeans from Topshop, Zara, and Forever 21. They were all labeled as a 4, but the results were vastly different. The pair from Zara ended up fitting very loosely on my waist, while the ones from Forever 21 were so small that I couldn\u2019t even zip them up.",
        "\u201dWe talked into the night. The kind of talk that seemed important until you discover girls.\u201d \u2014 Stand By Me Stranger Things, Netflix\u2019s newest offering, is technically an \u201980s science fiction horror. But at heart it\u2019s about coming of age amid \u201980s science fiction horror; at times it can barely maneuver through its reference density. Poltergeist, the films of John Hughes, Stand By Me, E. T. Poltergeist \u2014 the gang\u2019s all here.",
        "It\u2019s the question that many people sitting in a dentist chair dread. \u201dHave you been flossing?\u201d According to the American Dental Association, only about 40 percent of Americans floss once a day. Twenty percent say they never floss at all, and 27 percent lie about it. Whether or not we do it, we\u2019ve all been made to feel we should floss more often. The federal government has been recommending regular flossing since the 1970s. The American Dental Association says it \u201dhelps remove debris and . ..",
        "Faced with a 2016 GOP presidential nominee who disagrees with them on key issues, Charles and David Koch \u2014 the two billionaire \u201dKoch brothers\u201d \u2014 are directing the vast resources of their political network toward races. This should alarm liberals greatly. The Koch resources are likely to be more effective in state and congressional contests than they would be in the presidential race. What\u2019s more, the Koch network and other market networks at the state level already enjoy formidable clout \u2014 certainly far more power than the equivalent organizations.",
        "So far, discussion of cars has mostly confined itself to tech geeks and urbanists. But if they live up to their promise, autonomous vehicles could have seismic effects on America\u2019s economy and culture. It\u2019s probably time for a wider circle of participants, including economists, politicians, and social scientists, to start grappling seriously with what\u2019s coming. Let\u2019s take just one example: trucking. Millions of Americans drive trucks for a living Freight trucks (semis, tractor trailers, what have you) are so ubiquitous on US highways that we scarcely give them any thought.",
        "As I was watching Netflix\u2019s spooky new drama Stranger Things, a friend asked me how the show was. \u201dIt\u2019s scary!\u201d I said, then quickly realized that wasn\u2019t quite accurate and qualified the statement accordingly: \u201dIt\u2019s scary in the way that Poltergeist is scary when you stumble across it on TV when you\u2019re 8.\u201d And that response, I think, is the key to Stranger Things\u2019 success.",
        "Do you want to stop Donald Trump from rounding up Mexicans into camps? Try this: Encourage your idealistic, progressive and libertarian friends to drop their fantasies of an ideal, radically revised political and economic order and fight instead to protect what we\u2019ve got. It\u2019s the prudent thing to do, and it\u2019s the principled move. In a profound and persuasive new book, The Tyranny of the Ideal: Justice in a Diverse Society, the political philosopher Gerald Gaus shows that visions of political perfection are bound to lead us astray. Gaus\u2019s argument is forbiddingly technical, but it\u2019s not merely academic.",
        "In Tuesday\u2019s vice presidential debate, Donald Trump\u2019s running mate Governor Mike Pence claimed that \u201dThe day Iran released four Americans we delivered $400 million in cash as a ransom payment for Americans held in Tehran.\u201d But that\u2019s wrong. The US did not pay Iran a ransom. What Pence is referring to is a payment that President Obama announced back in January that was the result of an agreed settlement to a case in international court. It had nothing to do with any \u201dhostage\u201d payments.",
        "When a new elevated bike path in Rio collapsed in April, hit by a fluke wave, the deaths of two people weren\u2019t just seen as a tragedy. The collapse became an irresistible metaphor for the state of Olympic readiness in Brazil. As Rio prepares for the 2016 Summer Olympic Games, which open Friday night, the bike path is not the only disaster to serve that purpose.",
        "Was Melania Trump once an \u201cillegal immigrant\u201d? The potential first lady is definitely an immigrant \u2014 she came from Slovenia in the and settled in New York to work as a model. But lately, reporters (led by Frank Wilkinson at Bloomberg View) have been digging into the details. And they\u2019re raising the possibility that Melania Trump may have violated the terms of her visa when she first came to the United States. That might be true; it might not. It\u2019s a juicy political story because of Donald Trump\u2019s stances on immigration.",
        "Suicide Squad is a slog of a movie. It\u2019s the same piano key being struck at exactly the same volume, and exactly the same rhythm, for two hours. It\u2019s a big bowl full of lukewarm gruel. Rating 1. 5 I think, if worse comes to worst, that I preferred Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice to Suicide Squad. At least that earlier film was trying to be about something.",
        "Over the past few years, many states took an opportunity \u2014 enabled by a 2013 Supreme Court ruling \u2014 to pass a series of restrictions on voting that critics argue disproportionately hurt minority voters. But a series of court rulings last year put many of the new laws, or at least parts of them, on hold. From July through September, different courts across the country issued six rulings striking down some or all of six states\u2019 new voting restrictions. The message was clear: These restrictions are oppressive, particularly for minority voters."
