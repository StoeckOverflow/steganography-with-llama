        "Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are scheduled to have three presidential debates as the election heads into September and October. But first, Trump wants to debate when to debate. Trump has already started claiming that Clinton and the Democrats \u201dare trying to rig the debates\u201d \u2014 because two of the matchups will conflict with NFL games. The first debate, on September 26, coincides with a game between the Atlanta Falcons and New Orleans Saints.",
        "The presidential race may have reached a turning point, as a new group of polls shows Hillary Clinton clobbering Donald Trump nationally and in swing states. A national Fox News poll released Wednesday evening shows Clinton beating Trump by 10 percentage points, 49 percent to 39 percent. Then, a poll released Thursday shows Clinton ahead by a massive 15 points \u2014 real landslide territory and easily the best recent poll she\u2019s gotten, with her at 48 percent compared to Trump\u2019s 33 percent.",
        "Wednesday morning, NBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough said something profoundly frightening about Donald Trump. In a private conversation with a foreign policy expert, Scarborough reported, Trump asked \u2014 repeatedly \u2014 why we have nuclear weapons if we don\u2019t use them. \u201dSeveral months ago, a foreign policy expert on the international level went to advise Donald Trump. And three times [Trump] asked about the use of nuclear weapons. Three times he asked at one point if we had them why can\u2019t we use them,\u201d Scarborough said.",
        "I\u2019m . Or, put another way, as a Christian, I believe the sacred personhood of an individual begins before birth and continues throughout life, and I believe that sacred personhood is worth protecting, whether it\u2019s tucked inside a womb, waiting on death row, fleeing Syria in search of a home, or playing beneath the shadow of an American drone. I\u2019ve also voted for both and candidates for political office, including Barack Obama in 2012 and 2008, and George W. Bush in 2004 and 2000.",
        "The Olympics bring out the most casual of sports fans, for a variety of reasons. Some of those fans are blatantly enthralled by the storylines that network television will beat into viewers\u2019 heads. (Underdog? ? A comeback for the ages? We\u2019re bringing it to you every two years, snow or sunshine!) Others are actually thrilled to see the incredible athletic achievements in sports that rarely earn exposure in an online and cable universe.",
        "The Rio Olympics opening ceremonies get underway at 7 pm Eastern today in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s famous Maracan\u00e3 Stadium. But if you\u2019re hoping to watch live on television, you\u2019re in for a disappointment \u2014 NBC isn\u2019t airing the ceremony in real time. In the Eastern time zone, coverage starts at 7:30 pm; the ceremonies themselves will begin airing at 8 pm. How to watch the 2016 Rio Olympics The delays are staggered. If you\u2019re in the Central and Mountain time zones, tune in for the beginning of the ceremonies at 7 pm.",
        "In the to the Rio Olympics, the United States women\u2019s gymnastics team is generating excitement for two main reasons: First, as Vox\u2019s Santos has explained, they\u2019re almost certainly going to win the gold. Second, the five women who will compete \u2014 Simone Biles, Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas, Madison Kocian, and Laurie Hernandez \u2014 make up the most racially and ethnically diverse group of Olympic athletes in the team\u2019s history. Biles and Douglas are African American. Hernandez, whose mother describes her as a \u201dsecond generation Puerto Rican,\u201d identifies as Latina, Kocian and Raisman (who is Jewish) are both white.",
        "Here\u2019s how ridiculous this election is: A former CIA director believes a major party candidate is a foreign agent. Michael Morell, the former acting director of the CIA, made the accusation in a New York Times published on Friday. In it, Morrell accuses Donald Trump of being an \u201cunwitting agent\u201d of Russia. An \u201cunwitting agent,\u201d in spy terms, means someone who has been tricked or manipulated into serving as a foreign operative without knowing it. Morell believes that Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president who was a KGB agent for 16 years, has manipulated Trump by playing on his vanity.",
        "So you know those giant things that people on the internet have been hyping ever since 2010? The Chinese actually went and built one. Look at this sucker! The Transit Elevated Bus, a. k. a. the thing, is real The concept for the Transit Elevated Bus (TEB) has been floating around since engineer Song Youzhou, chair of the delightfully named Shenzhen Hashi Future Parking Equipment Co. introduced it at a Beijing expo in 2010.",
        "The 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro will kick off Friday with an opening ceremony directed by one of Brazil\u2019s most renowned filmmakers, Fernando Meirelles. To some, it might seem like a surprising pick. That\u2019s because Meirelles is best known for making 2002\u2019s City of God, a gritty film featuring drug trade and violent crime in Rio\u2019s impoverished favela neighborhoods in the 1980s. City of God remains one of Brazil\u2019s most famous films \u2014 and is also famous for bringing favelas to the forefront of the world\u2019s consciousness.",
        "When police went to Korryn Gaines\u2019s apartment in Baltimore County on Monday to serve an arrest warrant for a offense, she reportedly didn\u2019t comply. According to police, she barricaded herself in her home with a shotgun aimed at the officers. She kept her son at her side during the standoff. She threatened to kill the officers. And she allegedly shot back at police after they fired one shot, leading to a shootout that got her killed and her son injured.",
        "In the first episode of Netflix\u2019s Stranger Things, there\u2019s a slip of an reference. It\u2019s tiny, barely there. \u201dRace back to my place? Winner gets a comic,\u201d Dustin says, as he and Will speed home. \u201dAny comic?\u201d Will says, before taking off into the darkness. \u201dI\u2019ll take your 134!\u201d That mention of a specific comic is the last thing Will says to his friend, and to the audience, before disappearing. And it\u2019s not just a random comic book in Dustin\u2019s collection. Uncanny No. 134 is one of the most popular and significant issues in canon.",
        "The first thing you might have noticed about the opening ceremony for the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro was that it was quite a bit smaller than the last two, in Beijing and London, respectively. There was only one major set, and much of the rest of the show was carried off via the use of digital projection, which suggested other sets, or water, or the potentially devastating effects of climate change. (Seriously.",
        "Toward the end of the 2016 Olympic opening ceremony in Rio, a team will march in the Parade of Nations that shouldn\u2019t, ideally, be there at all. It will not carry the flag of any nation. Instead, it will carry the Olympic flag: a symbol of international unity and cooperation. That\u2019s somewhat ironic. The Refugee Olympic Team (or #TeamRefugee) is the first time refugees have been represented at the Olympic Games. And by representing the 19 million refugees and asylum seekers displaced around the world, the team is an inspiring symbol of internationalism.",
        "Donald Trump announced his economic advisers on Friday, and the list is about what you\u2019d expect from the real estate tycoon. Trump has vowed to bring a more approach to government; his list is dominated by businessmen \u2014 including several billionaires. Trump has railed against political correctness; his economic advisers are entirely white men.",
        "To really understand Paul Nehlen, the conservative underdog who is challenging House Speaker Paul Ryan in Tuesday\u2019s GOP primary in Wisconsin, you should probably just watch this video: With his tattooed biceps blazing, Nehlen rides a through rural Wisconsin, lambasts Ryan for supporting the Partnership, and then challenges the GOP leader to an competition. Elsewhere, Nehlen has been known to drive a bright yellow dump truck through Ryan\u2019s district with the slogan \u201dGet the Dirt on Ryan at DumpPaulRyan.",
        "There are many horror stories out there about airport security and the TSA (which should probably be abolished). But here\u2019s one heartwarming story to come out of it all, from Amanda Sapir, who\u2019s gender nonconforming: And then there was the time that I had the most socially conscious TSA pat down ever. After exiting the body scanner I told TSA staff, \u201cThe scanner is going to flag my crotch with a big yellow square. \u201d At that exact moment, the scanner results indeed showed the yellow square. \u201cHappens every time,\u201d I say. \u201cWhy do you think?\u201d she says.",
        "On June 13, one day into the aftermath of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, the following exchange took place between Sherlock Mark Gatiss and a Johnlock shipper \u2014 that is, a fan of the BBC\u2019s Sherlock Holmes drama who supports the hypothetical queer romantic relationship, or \u201dship,\u201d between Sherlock and John Watson. @LBudasi RIP \u2014 Mark Gatiss (@Markgatiss) June 13, 2016 The shipper\u2019s melodramatic comment may have been facetious, but Gatiss\u2019s \u201dRIP\u201d response caused a serious fandom meltdown among Johnlock supporters.",
        "Trevor Noah, the host of Comedy Central\u2019s The Daily Show, is funny. Very funny. Professionally funny. But what surprised me when I sat down with Noah for a recent episode of my podcast is just how serious he is too. In a conversation that ranged from what America could learn from South Africa\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission to why the Obama era has worsened racial polarization to how tragedy gets absorbed into partisanship, Noah didn\u2019t crack many jokes. He didn\u2019t destroy or eviscerate anyone.",
        "In a recent interview on Vox, Ezra Klein asked Hillary Clinton to name three books everyone should read that have influenced how she thinks about policy. She mentioned Christopher Lasch\u2019s work, without naming a title (his best known book is probably The Culture of Narcissism) and Habits of the Heart, a collection of sociological pieces on the nature of American community written by a team led by Robert Bellah.",
        "Suicide Squad was supposed to show the world why so many Batman fans love Harley Quinn, the sidekick who\u2019s so diabolically magnetic that she almost always manages to overshadow the Joker, who first inspired her to turn to a sordid life of crime. Instead, both the character and Margot Robbie\u2019s energetic performance threaten to be swallowed up by scathing reviews of the film\u2019s nonsensical editing, charges of violent misogyny, and the seemingly endless debate over what makes a good superhero movie. It\u2019s enough to make even the most fans back away slowly (and toward a bar, if they\u2019re lucky).",
        "San Francisco and other large American cities are facing a massive housing affordability problem, with rents spiraling beyond the reach of ordinary people. A fascinating article from the Financial Times argues that Japan may have found a solution to the problem. Most big American cities and their surrounding suburbs have housing regulations that strictly limit the number of new housing units that can be built. As a result, the demand for housing in the most economically dynamic cities has dramatically outpaced the supply.",
        "If you\u2019ve watched the new Netflix series Stranger Things or even read anything about it, you probably already know it\u2019s a giant love song to the \u201980s, replete with references to \u201980s movies and the works of Steven Spielberg and Stephen King. But while the series may leave many viewers with the feeling of having \u201dbeen here before,\u201d they may not know exactly where \u201dhere\u201d is.",
        "HBO\u2019s success is largely built atop shows that subvert and deconstruct familiar stories and genres. The Sopranos dissected the mob drama. Deadwood looked at the Western. Even Game of Thrones reimagines epic fantasy. This sort of deconstruction is something TV does really, really well. When you have to fill hour after hour with a story, you find yourself examining the underpinnings of that story and trying to identify what makes it tick. Occasionally, you\u2019ll start pulling those underpinnings apart entirely. Sometimes, you\u2019ll throw them out and start anew.",
        "Sen. Susan Collins ( ) has announced in a Washington Post that she will not be voting Donald Trump in the general election, saying he \u201ddoes not reflect historical Republican values,\u201d and is \u201dunworthy of being our president.\u201d Collins did not signal who she will vote for (indeed she explicitly stated she doesn\u2019t support Hillary Clinton) but she stated unequivocally it won\u2019t be the Republican nominee.",
        "There\u2019s a dynamic developing in the presidential race that\u2019s very dangerous for Donald Trump. New polls are coming in with increasingly dismal news for the GOP nominee. He now trails Clinton by 8. 9 points in a national matchup, on average. If that margin holds up, it would give Clinton the biggest popular vote victory in a presidential race since Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1984 landslide. That\u2019s all bad enough news for Trump in itself. But these polls have effects that will ripple outward, and could turn a possibly temporary poll decline into a permanent one.",
        "The most heated fight at the Rio Olympics lasted just a minute and four seconds. It was a battle between good and evil, the fair and unfair, the clean and the cheaters, with a hint of a Cold War twist. The conflict: a breaststroke battle between two swimmers, American Lilly King and Russian Yulia Efimova. In Sunday\u2019s qualifying race, King and Efimova came in first and second place, respectively, with times of a second apart.",
        "Monday afternoon the New York Times published an open letter from 50 foreign policy hands who had served in Republican administrations pledging to oppose Donald Trump. The letter, which you can read at the end of this post, suggests Trump \u201dwould be the most reckless president in American history.\u201d This, as with many things in this election cycle, is basically unprecedented: Foreign policy professions like these folks are usually angling for a job with their party\u2019s nominee, not publicly condemning him as a threat to national security.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s big economic speech wasn\u2019t particularly revealing as to the candidate\u2019s core economic philosophy, but it clarified the precarious place his campaign has come to rest. Trump has merged the weaknesses of an unqualified, outsider candidacy with the unpopular, plutocratic tilt of the conservative billionaire class\u2019s policy preferences. It\u2019s a campaign. It didn\u2019t have to be this way. The Trump campaign\u2019s original pitch made sense. Trump was a confident, celebrated businessman. His wealth and celebrity protected him from the corruptions of our campaign finance system.",
        "When Michael Phelps took to the water to swim in the relay Sunday, many noticed weird purple circles covering his right shoulder. The dots are the result of cupping, the latest alternative therapy elite athletes are using to try to recover faster and perform better. But as with a lot of alternative therapies, the science on these medicinal hickeys is pretty inconclusive, suggesting you may not need to sprint off to a cupping practitioner to try it out on your sore muscles."
