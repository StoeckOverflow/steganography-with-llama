        "Every week, critic at large Todd VanDerWerff and culture writer Caroline Framke get together to talk about Lifetime\u2019s splashy scripted drama UnReal. This week, we\u2019re discussing \u201dFriendly Fire\u201d the 10th and final episode of the second season. You can catch up our previous coverage of the series here, discuss this week\u2019s episode in the comments below. Todd VanDerWerff: \u201dFriendly Fire\u201d is about as good of a finale as this season of UnReal could have possibly had. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a great episode of television (though I mostly enjoyed it).",
        "The Bush family has finally embraced Donald Trump. Well, at least George P. Bush, the son of \u201d \u201d Jeb Bush, has. Without naming Trump, the Texas land commissioner gave Trump a tepid endorsement this weekend: \u201dFrom Team Bush, it\u2019s a bitter pill to swallow, but you know what? You get back up and you help the man that won, and you make sure that we stop Hillary Clinton,\u201d Bush said, speaking as the Texas GOP\u2019s victory chair, tasked with ensuring the election of Texas Republicans in November. Jeb Bush, George W. Bush, and George H. W.",
        "Everybody knows Hillary Clinton, and everybody particularly knows her foreign policy views. After all, she has been a presence in national politics for more than 25 years and has a long record as first lady, senator, and secretary of state. Most believe that Hillary Clinton is a \u201dhawk\u201d on foreign policy, and that as president, she would escalate current US military commitments in the Middle East and elsewhere, dragging America into more military misadventures in various corners of the world.",
        "Last week, the Iranian government executed an Iranian nuclear scientist for espionage. In light of the news, Donald Trump shared some additional insight on the scientist\u2019s death with his 10. 8 million Twitter followers: The Iranian government killed him because of Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201dhacked\u201d emails. His source: \u201dMany people are saying\u201d it. Many people are saying that the Iranians killed the scientist who helped the U. S. because of Hillary Clinton\u2019s hacked emails. \u2014 Donald J.",
        "I didn\u2019t leave the theater after seeing Hamilton. I resurfaced. Walking out into the cool night air, pushing past the people crowded near the stage door to catch even a glimpse of the show\u2019s cast as they exited, I felt as if I had been sitting on the floor of the ocean and needed to take my time breaking the water\u2019s surface, lest my body depressurize. It\u2019s an experience I\u2019ve had a few times in my life, always in the presence of great art.",
        "The 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro is underway. For months, people questioned whether the games would actually take place. Would the Olympic Park be ready in time? Would the Zika virus prove too dangerous for the athletes and spectators? Would the political turmoil and economic collapse bring the entire event to a standstill? But now those questions have come to an end as athletes, tourists, dignitaries, and journalists from around the world gather in Rio to for two weeks of sporting competition, in an Olympic Games expected to draw billions of viewers worldwide.",
        "The 2016 Olympic women\u2019s gymnastics team final wasn\u2019t a competition, it was a clinic taught by Team USA. During Simone Biles\u2019s floor routine, with the gold medal essentially clinched, you could see the Russian team \u2014 the Americans\u2019 bitter rivals for the last few Olympics \u2014 watching Biles work her magic. The US team should have handed out participation ribbons and charged a fee.",
        "The Baltimore Police Department is a complete and utter disaster. That\u2019s the only possible takeaway from reading the US Department of Justice\u2019s report into Baltimore police, leaked on Tuesday. The report found major flaws in even the most basic modern policing practices, from arrests to use of force to basic interactions with the community. To make it worse, these findings are compounded by what appears to be purposeful, disproportionate targeting of the city\u2019s black residents.",
        "On Tuesday, the New York Times published the startling revelation that in the weeks after Roger Ailes was ousted as CEO of Fox News for sexual harassment, Fox secretly paid off another Fox personality, Juliet Huddy \u2014 who said she was sexually harassed in 2011 by Bill O\u2019Reilly, the network\u2019s top host. Huddy was reportedly paid six figures in exchange for not suing the network and for keeping quiet about her explosive allegations.",
        "There are only a handful of constants in this world. Simone Biles, the most dominating gymnast the sport has ever seen, is one of them. On Thursday, Biles won gold at the 2016 Women\u2019s Olympic Individual competition. She scored a 62. 198, ahead of American Aly Raisman\u2019s 60. 098 and Russia\u2019s Aliya Mustafina who scored a 58. 665. It was a supreme performance. On Tuesday, Biles and the American women\u2019s gymnastics team annihilated the rest of the field at the 2016 Olympic team event, turning it into a clinic. Team USA finished the competition with a score of 184.",
        "Part of the great fun of watching the Olympics is witnessing athletes smash our expectations of what the human body is capable of. With the summer games in Rio, we admire gymnasts bend and contort in ways that seem to defy the limits of our physiology, like US gymnast Gabby Douglas here: Such extreme feats of flexibility may prompt us to question whether we should be working a little harder to touch our toes or do the splits.",
        "On Tuesday, something happened to the diving pool at the Rio Olympics. It turned green. Not just a little green. No. This was lime green, close to the color swatch movie set designers turn to when they want to make something look radioactive. As of Friday, the pool is closed \u2014 and as a correspondent for the Today Show noted, the issue isn\u2019t limited to the water: The Olympic diving pool has been closed again because of water quality issues.",
        "At a Tuesday rally, Donald Trump said something that could easily be interpreted as a call for violence against a future Clinton administration. \u201dHillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish the Second Amendment,\u201d Trump said. \u201dBy the way, and if she gets to pick \u2014 if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don\u2019t know.\u201d As is common with Trump, it\u2019s unclear exactly what he\u2019s saying \u2014 whether it\u2019s a call for assassination, armed insurrection, or something else entirely.",
        "Every year in August, the comet puts on a brilliant show. When the Earth plows into its wake, tiny bits of debris left behind from the comet slam into our atmosphere at 132, 000 miles per hour, reach temperatures of 3, 000 to 10, 000 degrees, and streak across the sky in what we call the Perseid meteor shower. In a normal year, the Perseids are the most spectacular meteor shower we can see. Spectators can normally see around 60 to 100 meteors an hour. But this is not a normal year.",
        "During a Wednesday night rally in Florida, Donald Trump said something that sounded absurd even for him \u2014 that President Obama founded ISIS. \u201dIn many respects, you know, they honor President Obama,\u201d Trump declared. \u201dHe\u2019s the founder of ISIS.\u201d This sure sounds like Trump is accusing Obama of secretly creating ISIS. But what Trump really meant by this, as he explained in a subsequent interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt, is that ISIS was the direct result of the US troop withdrawal from Iraq implemented under Obama.",
        "As you\u2019re surely aware by now, most polls taken after the conventions ended have shown Hillary Clinton surging to a sizable lead over Donald Trump. But of these polls have often been accompanied by the caveat that polling is volatile in the immediate wake of the conventions. A bounce for a candidate might not end up lasting. So when, you might wonder, should we really start trusting the polls again? The answer: right about now. We are two weeks out from the final day of the Democratic convention.",
        "On Sunday, NBC gymnastics commentator Al Trautwig wrote on Twitter that dominant American gymnast Simone Biles\u2019s parents are not actually her parents. Later, he deleted the tweet and apologized for it, but the internet, as it always does, remembered. So @AlTrautwig deleted his horribly rude & insulting comment but guess what, screenshot. @NBCOlympics #simonebiles pic. twitter. \u2014 Jen Talley (@jenunexpected) August 8, 2016 Biles\u2019s parents are her biological grandparents, who adopted her when she was a child.",
        "The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) won\u2019t reschedule marijuana after all, dashing a lot of pot legalization advocates\u2019 hopes on Wednesday. But in all the talk about marijuana\u2019s schedule and the disappointment people are feeling, one thing is getting lost: The DEA made other changes that could put marijuana on an inevitable path toward rescheduling \u2014 and therefore easing restrictions on it. First, a clarification. There are a lot of misconceptions about the scheduling system \u2014 most notably that it ranks drugs by their danger and criminalizes them.",
        "Hidden in the middle of Donald Trump\u2019s big speech on the economy was something rarely spotted in his unconventional campaign: an actual policy proposal. \u201cMy plan will also help reduce the cost of child care by allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of child care spending from their taxes,\u201d he said. It wasn\u2019t a detailed policy proposal. But it shows just how much influence Ivanka Trump, the candidate\u2019s daughter, could end up having on Trump\u2019s policies.",
        "\u201dHow do you spell Zika?\u201d I stood at the front desk of a major Washington, DC, hospital last month. I had a rash that developed after I\u2019d returned from the Dominican Republic, where Zika is much more common than it is stateside. The friend I\u2019d traveled with was showing symptoms of the virus. I\u2019d come to the emergency room to find out if I had it too. This was not a question I wanted to hear from the man who was checking me in.",
        "Suicide Squad is a dull, inept mess \u2014 a charmless and incoherent muddle of a film that left me rooting only for it to end. But it\u2019s more than just a bad movie. It\u2019s a bad sign for the entire DC Comics movie universe. Related Review: Suicide Squad is worse than Batman v Superman. No, we didn\u2019t think it was possible either. Warner Brothers, which owns DC Comics and the rights to its characters, has made no secret of its desire to develop a sprawling superhero franchise along the lines of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",
        "Last week, the Associated Press reported that there\u2019s little scientific evidence to show regular flossing is important for plaque reduction. Reluctant flossers rejoiced: If the government had no data to prove flossing prevents gum disease and tooth decay, then why do it? But in the wake of the revelations, the American Dental Association has stood its ground. In a statement, it said it would continue to call for the use of \u201cinterdental cleaners\u201d as part of a regular oral hygiene regimen.",
        "It\u2019s turning into a routine: Every few months, the US Department of Justice releases the results of another investigation into a local police department. The latest was the Baltimore Police Department, which repeatedly violated basic police practices, the First Amendment, and the Fourth Amendment, according to the Justice Department. Now, just like last time such a report was released, and the time before, we\u2019re left in total shock \u2014 how could a basic government institution go so horribly wrong? But maybe we should be asking ourselves why we\u2019re surprised anymore.",
        "After years of anticipation, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has decided whether it will remove marijuana from its harshest legal classification: Nope. The decision means marijuana will remain schedule 1, a category that includes other drugs like heroin and LSD, and is ranked higher than schedule 2, where cocaine and meth remain. Many advocates hoped marijuana would be rescheduled to schedule 2, particularly to unlock more research into the drug\u2019s medical value.",
        "Thursday night, Simone Manuel made history when she became the first black woman in the Olympics to ever earn an individual swimming gold medal and the first woman to win an individual medal. The groundbreaking win, which Manuel shared with Canada\u2019s Penny Oleksiak after a tie, would be worth celebrating in the context of any sport. But the particularly racist history of American swimming pools \u2014 and resulting lack of opportunity for black swimmers for decades \u2014 makes it an even more poignant victory.",
        "On Friday, August 12, it was announced that Brendan Dassey \u2014 a convicted killer in the 2005 murder of Teresa Halbach and one of the subjects of the Netflix documentary series Making a Murderer \u2014 could be a free man, or get a new trial. Federal US Magistrate Judge William Duffin overturned Dassey\u2019s murder conviction. The reason for the ruling was that Duffin decided that Len Kachinsky, Dassey\u2019s lawyer, committed \u201dindefensible\u201d \u201dmisconduct\u201d while representing Dassey, (an ABC affiliate) reported.",
        "On Friday, Donald Trump tried to walk back his claim that President Obama \u201dis the founder of ISIS\u201d in the most Trump way possible. He simply blamed the media for taking him so \u201dseriously.\u201d \u201dTHEY DON\u2019T GET SARCASM?\u201d he tweeted of CNN\u2019s coverage: Ratings challenged @CNN reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and Clinton) \u201dthe founder\u201d of ISIS, & MVP. THEY DON\u2019T GET SARCASM? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 12, 2016 I love watching these poor, pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out. They can\u2019t!",
        "One of the most persistent claims about Donald Trump\u2019s rise is that it\u2019s a response to economic anxiety and struggles among white Americans. This is a comforting notion, particularly for those on the left. It suggests that large numbers of Americans are not being drawn to a racist demagogue because he\u2019s a racist demagogue, but because of the failures of modern capitalism. It also implies that these voters could be won over by a robust economic agenda that addressed their plight. But there\u2019s also plenty of data suggesting that this isn\u2019t a satisfying explanation.",
        "Because of NBC\u2019s policy against GIFs, we used GIFs from Biles\u2019s and Mustafina\u2019s recent competitions. I\u2019ve linked video (NBC does not allow embedding) of the routines that are available online. American gymnast Simone Biles turned the Rio Olympics\u2019 women\u2019s individual gymnastics competition into a coronation. \u201dSimone is so good that the Olympics have become boring,\u201d Dave Lease, the editor of TSL, a figure skating and gymnastics news website, told me. Biles scored a 62.",
        "Back in August, Donald Trump did something that\u2019s very odd for him. He admitted that his campaign was in big trouble somewhere. \u201dYou\u2019ve got to get your people out to vote. [We\u2019re] having a tremendous problem in Utah,\u201d Trump told an audience of evangelical pastors in Florida. Now, Utah is one of the most Republican states in the country, and usually one a GOP presidential candidate can take for granted. Mitt Romney won it by 48 points in 2012. But a poll released this Wednesday by Y2 Analytics proves Trump was right to be concerned."
