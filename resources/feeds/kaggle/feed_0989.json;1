        "If you\u2019ve ever driven on a highway, you\u2019ve probably seen it happen. Traffic slows to a crawl, then stops entirely. Minutes later, it begins to move again, and then suddenly, you\u2019re moving at full speed. The weirdest part: there\u2019s no construction, accident, or other possible explanation for the traffic. Why does this happen? As it turns out, a few different groups of researchers have been using mathematical calculations and experiments to try answering this question. And they think they have the answer. They also have suggestions on how to stop these jams.",
        "If you\u2019re a prison guard or inmate, your safety may hinge on whether you\u2019re positioned at a privately run, prison or a public facility. That conclusion comes from a new report by the US Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) which looked at federal prisons run by three companies \u2014 the Corrections Corporation of America, the GEO Group, and the Management and Training Corporation \u2014 to compare them with similar public prisons. And the findings don\u2019t look good for private prisons.",
        "Update: The Daily Beast took down its article on Thursday night, issuing an apology to its readers. \u201dWe were wrong. We\u2019re sorry,\u201d an editor\u2019s note read. \u201dAnd we apologize to the athletes who may have been inadvertently compromised by our story.\u201d My original story on the Daily Beast\u2019s article follows below. The Daily Beast has a bizarre story in which reporter Nico Hines got a few dates on Grindr while stationed in Rio de Janeiro to cover the Summer Olympics.",
        "The former Milwaukee police officer who shot and killed Sylville Smith, a black man, has been acquitted of reckless homicide charges on Wednesday. Police said Dominique who is also black, shot and killed Smith after Smith took off during a traffic stop. Officials said Smith was armed with an allegedly stolen handgun, but Smith reportedly tossed the gun away, according to court documents, before fired the fatal shot.",
        "Over the weekend, protests in Milwaukee over a police shooting briefly erupted into riots \u2014 as hundreds of people burned down businesses and police cars and attacked pedestrians, reporters, and cops. But as the details of the shooting came out, we found out that Sylville Smith, the who was shot, had a long arrest record and was possibly armed. That led many people online to wonder why Milwaukee residents would burn down parts of their city over someone who\u2019s, frankly, not an ideal martyr.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s collapse has hurt him in the polls across the country. But it\u2019s really hurt his numbers in some crucial swing states in particular \u2014 states that would be enough to give Hillary Clinton an Electoral College majority. Now Trump is trailing in an average of poll results for every swing state from the past two cycles. That includes, of course, the traditional powerhouses of Florida and Ohio, where Clinton has taken leads. But there are six states that have moved especially dramatically in Clinton\u2019s direction.",
        "After a year and a half of keeping things 100, The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore has been canceled, Comedy Central confirmed to the New York Times. The show\u2019s final episode aired Thursday, August 18. Wilmore is understandably disappointed, saying in a prepared statement that while he\u2019s grateful to have had the chance to host The Nightly Show, he\u2019s \u201dalso saddened and surprised we won\u2019t be covering this crazy election or \u2019The Unblackening\u2019 as we\u2019ve coined it.",
        "For months, Donald Trump\u2019s rise in the Republican Party silenced conservative elites. Unable to go against the public, yet weary of his bombast and seemingly lose party allegiance, traditional Republicans largely stayed out of primary politics. But with every new controversy, more and more Republicans are breaking their silence: They cannot and will not vote for Trump in November. The release of a hot mic recording from 2005 in which Trump brags about groping women without their consent prompted the latest wave of prominent Republicans distancing themselves from the Republican nominee.",
        "Four years ago, at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Gabby Douglas became the first black American woman to win gymnastics\u2019 most prestigious title: Olympic individual champion. She was 16 at the time, a bundle of flash and grace in a metallic leotard. Looking back at her best event, the uneven bars, is like watching a superhero use her powers for the first time. Douglas almost seems uncertain of her own ability, still figuring out how much power to pump into each swing.",
        "One of the most popular ideas about Donald Trump this election cycle is that he has awakened a deep sense of \u201deconomic anxiety\u201d from the white working class. This idea is often said to be supported by his poll numbers, and it\u2019s true that white, voters are backing him to a greater degree than other recent Republican candidates. But though this theory is popular, I am not a fan of it for one pretty simple reason: I think pundits owe people the modicum of respect entailed by assuming that their behavior makes some kind of sense.",
        "Like this video? Subscribe to Vox on YouTube. Echoing a paper by philosopher Nick Bostrom, Elon Musk thinks there is a good chance humankind is living in a simulated reality. The general idea of our reality boils down to three possibilities \u2014 humans go extinct before we are able to run a simulation of this size, humans choose not to run ancestor simulations, or we are currently participating in such a simulation.",
        "Roger Ailes, the only CEO Fox News has ever had, resigned in disgrace last month amid charges of sexual harassment. But the story hasn\u2019t ended there: after former Fox host Gretchen Carlson filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Ailes, at least 20 other women have contacted Carlson\u2019s attorneys too. A handful of those women reached out as witnesses, but almost all of them said they had personally experienced harassment from Ailes \u2014 who has denied all allegations so far.",
        "Climate change is a wickedly complex problem. But if you had to isolate one factor as the key, the linchpin upon which any credible global solution must turn, it is this: coal in China. Coal use has exploded in China over the last 30 years, especially the last 15. For any chance of success in avoiding the worst effects of climate change, the country must reverse that trend \u2014 peak and then rapidly reduce coal use, hitting zero as soon as practically possible, preferably some time around 2035 to 2050.",
        "One person calls the other dumb. The second guy responds by calling the first an \u201dasshole\u201d and a \u201ddumbass with his head up his ass.\u201d The first guy fires back again, accusing his \u201d \u201d antagonist of throwing a \u201dtantrum.\u201d Is this a middle school playground argument? Two drunks yelling at a bar? A YouTube comments section? Nah. It\u2019s a war of words between two of America\u2019s most prominent conservative pundits: Fox News anchor Sean Hannity and Wall Street Journal columnist Bret Stephens. The two men are at odds over, what else, Donald Trump.",
        "When you purchase a ticket for Seth Rogen\u2019s Sausage Party \u2014 a tale of anthropomorphic food and religion \u2014 you are implicitly agreeing to be jackhammered by 90 minutes\u2019 worth of dick jokes courtesy of Rogen and his friends (here, he shares screenplay credits with Kyle Hunter, Ariel Shaffir, and Evan Goldberg). But you\u2019re also placing a bit of a bet. Is it possible to make dick jokes that go beyond the obvious hot dog and bun gag? Are there any other food objects as raunchy or as perfectly phallic as a hot dog?",
        "I can\u2019t recommend The Get Down as effusively as I\u2019d like. Rating 3. 5 For most people, I imagine, the first six episodes of the show\u2019s first season \u2014 which, due to production issues, Netflix has opted to release in two parts, with the remaining six episodes arriving in 2017 \u2014 will seem very messy indeed. The first episode feels nothing like the five that follow, and way too much of the dialogue has characters explaining things to each other that they would probably already know, just so the audience can keep up.",
        "There is a case to be made that the media created Donald Trump. It was, reportedly, his anger at being dismissed by political pundits that led him to run for president in the first place. And it was, arguably, the media\u2019s coverage of his every utterance that powered his victory in the Republican primary. But slowly, surely, the media has turned on Trump. He still gets coverage, but that coverage is overwhelmingly negative.",
        "Simone Biles is the most dominant female gymnast in recent memory, possibly history. For the past three years, she\u2019s won every team and individual competition she\u2019s competed in. At the Olympics, she maintained that record, helping the American team to gold as well as wiping the floor during the individual competition. She also added a gold medal in vault and a bronze on balance beam. And on Tuesday, Biles added a gold in the floor exercise, bringing her total to four golds and five medals in all. Biles scored a 15. 966, almost a better than Aly Raisman\u2019s 15.",
        "In a speech Monday, Trump laid out an immigration policy that would make it much harder to enter the US \u2014 and harder still to move here. He suggested \u201cextreme vetting\u201d for any entrant to the US \u2014 from immigrants to tourists \u2014 and an \u201cideological test\u201d for people who wanted to settle down in America for good. Trump framed this as an act of love for America. \u201cPride in our institutions, our history, and our values should be taught by parents and teachers, and impressed upon all who join our society,\u201d he said during the speech.",
        "The video changed everything. The surreptitious recording of a teacher berating a for failing to explain a math problem correctly, ripping up her paper, and then inexplicably telling the subdued child to go sit in the \u201dcalm down chair\u201d went viral and a national debate over the \u201dno excuses\u201d charter school model \u2014 a pedagogical approach marked by heavy workloads, rigid discipline, and a relentless focus on metrics, particularly standardized tests. The Success Academy Charter Schools are arguably the institutions that follow this model.",
        "On Monday, Donald Trump gave a speech billed as a major address on terrorism policy. It was nonsense, meant literally: not merely wrong but actually incoherent; a mishmash of logical fallacies, lies, and contradictions. Over the course of a single speech, Trump managed to: completely contradict many of his most important past positions on foreign policy; reject nation building even while endorsing an indefinite occupation of Iraq; and make embarrassing factual errors about a whole host of topics ranging from NATO to the rise of ISIS.",
        "Just a few months ago, Aetna was an insurer you could count on to be especially bullish on Obamacare. Chief executive Mark Bertolini told Aetna shareholders in April that the law was \u201da good investment.\u201d In May, he announced plans to expand to five additional states. But Aetna made a sharp on Obamacare this month. Last week, the insurer scrapped that expansion plan, citing millions in losses on the marketplaces. And on Monday, Aetna announced it would quit 11 states it currently sells in, remaining in just four markets. Aetna did not quit Obamacare quietly.",
        "American sprinter Allyson Felix would\u2019ve had another Olympic gold medal instead of a silver if Shaunae Miller had stayed on her feet. Miller, a fantastic runner from the Bahamas, beat Felix in the women\u2019s Olympic sprint on Monday night by diving, for the finish line. Miller came out of the blocks with a big lead on Felix. But as she approached the finish line, she seemed to run out of gas, with Felix breathing down her neck in the last few meters. So Miller dived, her torso crossing the finish line at 49.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s war on the \u201cdishonest and corrupt\u201d media reached new heights on Sunday in a series of tweets. If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn\u2019t put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20% \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2016 It is not \u201dfreedom of the press\u201d when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false! \u2014 Donald J.",
        "Donald Trump has found ways to alienate some members of all factions of conservative politics, but neoconservative intellectuals, operatives, and policy hands have been the most heavily represented element in the ranks of Republicans. That\u2019s largely because unlike social conservatives or free marketers, Trump hasn\u2019t even tried to court neoconservative support. On the contrary, he\u2019s gone to substantial lengths to exaggerate the extent of his historical differences with them, pretending to have opposed regime change operations in Iraq and Libya that he in fact supported.",
        "If you combine the best election forecasting models that political scientists have produced, they tell you that Republicans should be favored to win the 2016 presidential election, albeit narrowly. If you look at the polls, however, you find Donald Trump is losing this election, and it isn\u2019t even close. Our best estimate, as of today, is that Trump is costing Republicans about 5. 7 percentage points in the polls \u2014 enough to turn a narrow win into a big loss.",
        "The Olympics have been called a \u201dcarnival of junk food marketing\u201d for good reason. McDonald\u2019s, and Kellogg\u2019s are all official Olympics sponsors as well as sponsors of teams like Team USA and Team Great Britain. And when we see ads from them and other food companies during the Olympics, they\u2019re likely to showcase less healthy items, according to the nonprofit Children\u2019s Food Campaign. But there\u2019s one food company that\u2019s going against the grain. In August 2015, the discount food grocer Aldi became the first supermarket sponsor of Team Great Britain.",
        "I woke up one Tuesday in June, and I laughed. I had hundreds of hateful, threatening Twitter notifications. I tracked down the instigator, and found a blog post by a journalist, who ended his article with screenshots of tweets I\u2019d sent about my show, The Bachelor. That\u2019s when I laughed \u2014 hysterically. I immigrated to the US from Japan in 1997 when I was 6 years old, a hybrid child with big American dreams. In November 2015, I was tapped to serve as a volunteer on a Department of Homeland Security task force on countering violent extremism.",
        "Donald Trump is shaking up his flailing presidential campaign \u2014 and in a way that makes clear he\u2019s going \u201dfull Trump\u201d in the election\u2019s final months. On Wednesday morning, Trump announced that he has installed Steve Bannon, the CEO of Breitbart News, as the new \u201dchief executive\u201d of his campaign. This basically means that Paul Manafort, who was brought in as campaign chairman months ago, has been demoted.",
        "There has been a theory, circulating in Washington\u2019s health policy circles for the past few weeks, that major insurer Aetna was scaling back its Obamacare marketplace plans because the Obama administration blocked its proposed merger with Humana. Up until now, this was only a theory \u2014 one inferred from the timing of the blocked merger (in July) and Aetna souring on Obamacare (in August). Now there\u2019s proof. Documents obtained by the Huffington Post show that Aetna expressly conditioned its marketplace participation on the merger\u2019s approval."
