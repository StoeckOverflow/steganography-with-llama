        "Almost every network executive introducing their fall TV schedule at this summer\u2019s Television Critics Association press tour was quick to tout the diversity of their programming lineup, or to reassure the assembled critics that they take diversity seriously, they know they can do better with diversity, have you heard that they\u2019re truly very concerned with diversity? In short, just about everyone wanted us to know they love diversity. The exception? Many of the nonwhite people in the room were sick to death of talking about it.",
        "For the past several years, there have been troubling signs of an uptick in America\u2019s homicide rates \u2014 a potential deviation from the trend in which crime has dramatically dropped since the . Many people have pushed back, arguing that there is in fact no uptick and if there was, a year or two does not make a trend. Among those arguing this are groups like the Brennan Center for Justice, which wants the US to dramatically shrink its prison population to, hopefully, lose its status as the world\u2019s leader in incarceration.",
        "The census is a survey the United States conducts every decade to take stock of who lives in the country. But it\u2019s also more than that: The census is a time capsule of a place and era during which it is collected \u2014 the survey\u2019s race and ethnicity categories are a testimony of that. You can see in this interactive what labels the agency has used over time, since the census began in 1790, and also how the government might have categorized you had you lived in that era. Take me as an example.",
        "Ryan Lochte, America\u2019s majestic merman and Olympic medalist, has triggered the most confusing story to come out of the Rio Olympics. The tale does not involve doping, or Zika, or human body parts washing up on the sand of Copacabana Beach. No. Lochte\u2019s story is about getting mugged, lying about it, and causing an international commotion, a series of events that might have happened because, like a teen, Lochte didn\u2019t want to tell his mother about what he did on Saturday night.",
        "With 10 or so weeks to go until Election Day, the most common measure of just how far ahead Hillary Clinton is in the presidential race is where her campaign is spending less money. Clinton\u2019s campaign has (at least for the moment) stopped spending money to put ads on the air in Colorado and Virginia.",
        "For most of the past decade, meat consumption in the United States was falling. In 2014, Americans ate 18 percent less beef, 10 percent less pork, and 1. 4 percent less chicken than they did in 2005, according to the US Department of Agriculture. For environmental, health, and animal welfare advocates, this was great news. Surely it meant that efforts to raise awareness about the disturbing impacts of meat production were inspiring people to cut back on hamburgers and bacon.",
        "This week, Aetna announced it would stop selling insurance plans in all but four Obamacare exchanges, the markets set up under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Aetna, which now covers more than 800, 000 people in 15 exchanges, said it had been hemorrhaging money on the plans.",
        "When Donald Trump goes off script, transcribing him can be a challenge. As someone covering him during this campaign, I can attest to this. When he\u2019s speaking off the cuff, his rambling remarks can be full of digressions and tangents. He often jumps to an entirely new thought before finishing his previous one. Consider this Trump comment on the Iran nuclear deal during a campaign rally in South Carolina on July 21, 2015. Try to follow the train of thought here: Look, having nuclear \u2014 my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr.",
        "Van Jones is keenly aware of the political pressure that a new president can face. He joined up with the Obama White House in its first year to be its \u201dgreen jobs\u201d czar. But just months later, he was pushed out under pressure from the right.",
        "News about Obamacare has not been good this week. On Monday, the health insurance giant Aetna announced it would stop selling coverage in 11 state marketplaces. This follows UnitedHealth\u2019s exit from Obamacare, as well as the exit of dozens of smaller health insurance plans. Ezra Klein and Sarah Kliff have been writing about Obamacare ever since Congress started debating it. So they took an hour on Tuesday to talk about the Aetna news, what it means for Obamacare, and whether it\u2019s time to get seriously worried about the future of the marketplaces.",
        "Bill McKibben \u2014 author, activist, mensch, and, though he would hate me saying so, the closest thing the climate movement has to a spokesperson \u2014 has a bracing new piece in the New Republic called \u201dA World at War.\u201d His thesis is simple: Climate change is tantamount to a global war, being waged on us by physics. \u201dWorld War III is well and truly underway,\u201d he writes.",
        "As Donald Trump undertakes his second major campaign shakeup of the summer, it\u2019s worth reflecting on the remarkable stability of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 quest for the presidency. Campaign chair John Podesta is exactly where he was a year ago. So are policy point man Jake Sullivan, communications director Jennifer Palmieri, spokesperson Brian Fallon, and basically everyone else. The campaign is bigger than it was a year ago, with more field organizers and regional offices and an digital team.",
        "On August 12, meteorologists began sounding the alarm that a weather system would deliver about 24 inches of water to communities on the Louisiana coast. Had it been a hurricane, more advance warning would have been possible to give people more time to evacuate. But this storm was harder to predict \u2014 and so it took the region largely by surprise. The extensive flooding that ensued has left 13 dead and 60, 000 homes damaged across 20 parishes in the state.",
        "The general public has offered its final verdict on Suicide Squad and it\u2019s. .. not good. The supervillain film tumbled nearly 70 percent at the domestic box office in its second weekend, and experienced similar erosion at the international ticket counter. Even with a decided lack of direct competition \u2014 the two biggest new releases of Suicide Squad\u2019s second weekend were Sausage Party and Pete\u2019s Dragon \u2014 the movie failed to become the gigantic breakout smash that might have retroactively saved an anemic summer for Hollywood. But the problem is bigger than one movie\u2019s disappointing second weekend.",
        "Hollywood has given us many a master class in warped priorities, but film studio Fox Searchlight might have outdone them all, with one of the worst botched publicity campaigns maybe ever. As it prepares for the October 7 release of its highly anticipated drama The Birth of a Nation, the studio has attempted to preemptively stave off awards season backlash by addressing Nate Parker\u2019s tumultuous past head on. But instead of bolstering the film\u2019s Oscar chances, it has created an extraordinarily ugly controversy, and everyone involved is worse off for it.",
        "LeBron James, the greatest basketball player alive, isn\u2019t on the US Olympic team. But after watching the Americans struggle, he says he wishes he were playing. But he\u2019s not. And neither are Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, and a handful of other elite players. As much as we want complex reasons for Team USA\u2019s struggles, the explanation might be far simpler: This team isn\u2019t as talented as the dominant squads of yore \u2014 and data backs this up.",
        "Many smart analysts across the political spectrum have rightly situated Donald Trump\u2019s run for president in the international context of the parties found throughout Western Europe. In the UK, the Independence Party (UKIP) just led the winning referendum campaign \u2014 Brexit \u2014 in support of Britain leaving the European Union. In late 2015, the French National Front (FN) received 27 percent of the vote in local elections around the country. Like Trump, these and other European rightist parties have made the limitation of immigration their most salient issue.",
        "The divorce of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp is now final, and one thing\u2019s for sure: Heard didn\u2019t get any money out of it. She settled the divorce out of court for $7 million, all of which she has now donated to charitable causes. She\u2019s splitting the sum between the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s efforts to battle violence against women and the Children\u2019s Hospital of Los Angeles, where she\u2019s volunteered for the past 10 years.",
        "When Uber announced Thursday that it would begin offering rides in cars to customers in Pittsburgh, it caused a lot of consternation among people worried about job losses. After all, sharing economy companies like Uber are supposed to represent one of the economy\u2019s big sources of job growth. If even Uber is automating its fleet, doesn\u2019t that mean workers are doomed? But in an interview with Business Insider, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick argues that Uber drivers shouldn\u2019t worry.",
        "With the recently resurfaced rape allegations against The Birth of a Nation director and star Nate Parker, a debate about what exactly defines rape, and the evolving understanding of sexual consent, has been reinvigorated. Parker and his roommate were charged in 2001 with raping an fellow Penn State student after a night of drinking: They claimed the encounter was fully consensual, while the alleged victim said she was unconscious at the time.",
        "Every day of the Olympic Games in Rio seems to have generated at least one cringeworthy story about female athletes. Each incident on its own can be addressed with little more than an eye roll \u2014 sexism is nothing new, especially for women athletes. But cumulatively, the portrayal of female Olympians points to a real issue of inequality for women in sports, compared with their male peers, and how poorly (if ever) they are typically represented in mainstream sports media.",
        "The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore took its final bow on Thursday, and not by choice. Since Comedy Central unceremoniously canceled the series earlier in the week, Wilmore has candidly discussed his disappointment with the decision, especially because it means The Nightly Show won\u2019t be covering the final stretch of the 2016 presidential election.",
        "\u201dIf you must blink, do it now.\u201d So begins the gripping and gorgeous story of Kubo and the Two Strings, the latest film from the animation studio Laika and an early comer for the best animated film of the year (and one of the best films of the year, period). A quintessential hero\u2019s journey set in a dreamy, folkloric Japan, Kubo is a story about stories, told with a sophistication that never gets in the way of its straightforward earnestness or its stunning visuals.",
        "Donald Trump is running his first campaign ad for the general election, and it offers all the proof you\u2019ll need that, in a fundamental sense, no meaningful change of approach can or will ever emanate from his campaign. Because this is an ad, it\u2019s professionally done and in its language \u2014 it\u2019s not an remark or full of anything so crazy that it will make lifelong Republicans cringe. But there\u2019s nothing in here about free markets or traditional family values or America\u2019s role as the world\u2019s indispensable nation and guarantor of liberty.",
        "It\u2019s been a big week for Amy Schumer. Her book, The Girl With the Lower Back Tattoo, came out on Tuesday to generally good reviews and high sales, and is currently No. 6 on Amazon. But in the midst of this impressive debut, Schumer found herself fielding outrage from both the right and the left sides of the culture wars. And in the aftermath, she appeared to prematurely cancel her TV show.",
        "Our long national nightmare is finally over: Frank Ocean is actually, for real (probably) in the process of dropping the album to his 2012 tour de force, Channel Orange. Late on August 18, Ocean released a video full of original music via his website, to the joy and relief of his salivating fans. Titled Endless, it features contributions from artists like Jazmine Sullivan, Radiohead\u2019s Johnny Greenwood, James Blake, and the London Contemporary Orchestra. It\u2019s gorgeous, haunting and strange.",
        "Overdose on heroin? You might die. Overdose on cocaine? You also might die. Alcohol? The same. But marijuana? You won\u2019t die. But you might say some mean things to your cat. That last bit comes from a story from the Omaha seriously headlined, \u201dOmaha dad finds pot brownies, eats 4 of them, says mean things to cat.\u201d Kevin Cole reported for the Nebraska newspaper that the father had eaten four of his adult children\u2019s pot brownies, which were stashed away in the backseat of a car.",
        "I\u2019ve never known exactly when a friend is going to die \u2014 until today. It\u2019s a Sunday morning in late July, and I\u2019m struggling to put on my friend Betsy\u2019s red Donna Karan wrap dress. I\u2019m definitely doing it wrong. I can tell because Betsy groans with frustration. She\u2019s unable to talk because she\u2019s in the final stages of ALS, a neurodegenerative disease that is slowly depriving her of the power to move, speak, eat, and breathe.",
        "The games of the XXXI Olympiad are just about over. The event featured amazing athletic feats, spectacular shows of teamwork, touching personal narratives, and inspiring examples of hard work paying off.",
        "Hillary Clinton is the first woman presidential nominee of a major American political party, and it\u2019s very possible that she will become our first woman president. This is a major historical milestone. But Clinton\u2019s nomination, and the prospect of her election, doesn\u2019t mean the same thing to everyone \u2014 even prominent, feminists. Related Why some feminists are conflicted about Hillary Clinton\u2019s historic candidacy That\u2019s why Vox asked nine feminist activists, leaders, and thinkers about what this moment means to them, both personally and in the big picture. Is it a personal or political triumph?"
