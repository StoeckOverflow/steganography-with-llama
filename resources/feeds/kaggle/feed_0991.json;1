        "For many feminists, Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy is incredibly exciting. It\u2019s not just a chance to break a historical barrier by electing America\u2019s first woman president. It\u2019s also the chance to elect this particular woman: a vocal feminist, a lifelong advocate for women\u2019s and children\u2019s issues, and a highly qualified public servant who has weathered decades of sexist scrutiny in the public spotlight. \u201dI\u2019m moved that we actually got here in my lifetime, and I\u2019m glad that it\u2019s her,\u201d said Sady Doyle, author of the upcoming book Trainwreck: The Women We Love to Hate, Mock, and Fear . ..",
        "With July as the hottest month on record, climate change just keeps getting more real. And yet surveys show that Americans still have disparate opinions about it. In 2015, Vox\u2019s David Roberts broke down data from the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication, which has surveyed the American climate opinion since 2007. Here\u2019s how he summarized it: \u201dAmericans don\u2019t understand climate change very well, but they see it as a threat and support policies to address it \u2014 just not the policies wonks want them to support.\u201d Most Americans believe climate change will harm future generations.",
        "Do people have a right to defend themselves against a tyrannical government? And does the Second Amendment reinforce that right? Donald Trump appeared to be referring to such a right recently, in his muddled comments about \u201dSecond Amendment people.\u201d But trying to discern the thinking behind Trump\u2019s thoughtless blather is pointless. Instead, it\u2019s better to consider the guidance of the Constitution and the founders. According to the Declaration of Independence, the only legitimate governments are those with the consent of the governed.",
        "I\u2019ve often heard Europeans express shock over the gargantuan portions American restaurants dish out. Which is why, on a recent holiday with my boyfriend, I was surprised to find the waiters at everything from small, pizzerias to gourmet restaurants in Puglia (the heel of Italy\u2019s boot) piling our table with plates and servings exceeding American proportions. Breakfast for two at our modest seaside beach apartment featured a basket of croissants and bread, plates of salami and cheese, yogurts, and platters of fruits, jams, butter, and nuts \u2014 enough to hold us over for an entire day!",
        "Since he was tragically killed on May 28, Harambe the gorilla has transcended his lowly origins as some random zoo gorilla. In his afterlife, he has become a superhero, a the internet\u2019s gorilla. The \u201dHarambe\u201d meme takes myriad forms, including popular like parody memorials and the popular viral slogan \u201ddicks out for Harambe.\u201d It has also been decried for its racist undercurrent, despite the fact that black communities played a part in creating the meme and popularizing its initial spread on social media. On Reddit, forums memorializing him, like and have gained thousands of readers since Harambe\u2019s death.",
        "Originally published on Grist. Long after the athletes have packed up their Speedos and the torch has gone out, the structures that house the 2016 Olympics will remain. While Rio de Janeiro used its existing national soccer stadium for the opening and closing ceremonies, it also built a number of other stadiums and venues for the games \u2014 and displaced 80, 000 residents in the process. So what\u2019s to come of all those buildings once everyone has taken their balls and gone home?",
        "Donald Trump is weird. So weird, in fact, that plenty of Republicans cannot bear to support him. It\u2019s a case Hillary Clinton is making to the American people in her ads against Trump. And many political strategists say this is a smart tactic. Trump is a deeply unusual presidential candidate. He has no experience in public office, and he appears to suffer from some genuinely unusual deficits in terms of personal and ability to build a professional campaign operation. He also brings to the table some highly unusual policy ideas, like converting NATO into some kind of protection racket.",
        "Seventeen years ago, a song was conjured from the erotic feeling of leather pants against Rob Thomas\u2019s skin and the dark enchantment of Carlos Santana\u2019s guitar strings. That strange combination produced something far stronger and more enduring than other artifacts from that year, like frosted tips or Napster. That something is the triumph that is \u201dSmooth.\u201d Since the song\u2019s 1999 inception, \u201dSmooth\u201d has washed up in bits and pieces in various corners of the internet, but the wave suddenly crested in summer 2016.",
        "Democrats are currently on track to retake the Senate, according to the latest polls \u2014 though they don\u2019t have much room for error. If Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, her party would need a net gain of four seats to take over control of the chamber. And just a few months ago, the party had a clear advantage in polls of just two contests. But the combination of Donald Trump\u2019s nomination and a strong recruitment effort has bolstered Democrats\u2019 chances.",
        "I\u2019m newly sober and I\u2019m wearing unwise (but cute, so cute) shoes at the farmers market. It\u2019s a beautiful summer day. I trip, cracking my phone, the knees of my favorite jeans, and scraping both my palms. Naturally, as soon as I\u2019ve dusted myself off, I post about it on Facebook. Three women who don\u2019t know I\u2019ve quit drinking comment quickly: \u201dWine. Immediately.\u201d \u201dDo they sell wine there?\u201d \u201dDefinitely wine. And maybe new shoes.\u201d Have I mentioned that it\u2019s morning when this happens? On a weekday? This isn\u2019t one of those nightclub farmers markets.",
        "What if potential viewers were the ones to decide whether or not a TV show gets made? This is the loose idea behind Amazon Studios\u2019 \u201dpilot seasons,\u201d or the semiannual periods when it makes the first episodes of prospective shows available to watch for free, and then surveys viewers to find out if they want more \u2014 or less \u2014 of what they just saw.",
        "Donald Trump, equipped with a new campaign team and a national media desperate for a competitive horserace, is set to reboot his campaign this week with a return to the issue that launched him to political superstardom: immigration. The question is exactly what sort of reboot it will be.",
        "Originally published on Grist. If there\u2019s any hope of preventing California from shriveling into a parched wasteland, the state will have to figure out some simple things first. Namely, how much water it has and where it\u2019s all going. Shockingly, California isn\u2019t tracking much of its water. It\u2019s like a business that\u2019s opted to fire the accountants and operate under the honor system, using an abacus and estimates from middle managers. A new report from the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, known as PPIC, says that the state\u2019s drought has exposed \u201cserious gaps and fragmentation.",
        "In 2015, Freddie Gray died from a neck injury while in the custody of Baltimore police, and all of the officers involved in the arrest and charged with felonies related to his death have been acquitted. Monday, two of them got more news: big checks. The Baltimore Sun reports that Alicia White and William Porter, two of the officers who were there the day Gray was placed in the back of a police van, where doctors believe his spine was severed, will receive a combined $167, 000 ($98, 855 to White and $70, 523 to Porter) in back pay.",
        "Bowing to common sense and good judgment after a effort to do otherwise, Bill and Chelsea Clinton announced today that their foundation will massively scale back its undertakings if Hillary Clinton becomes president \u2014 shutting down the signature Clinton Global Initiative and transforming itself into a much smaller nonprofit focused on a narrower range of undertakings like the Clinton Presidential Library. This follows \u2014 and greatly expands upon \u2014 the news that leaked last week that the foundation would stop accepting donations from foreign governments and corporations.",
        "Earlier this month, Elon Musk made news again when he announced his intention to offer solar roofs, a product he sensed might need a few words of clarification. \u201dIt\u2019s a solar roof as opposed to a module on a roof,\u201d he said on an earnings call about the planned merger between his electric car company, Tesla, with his cousin\u2019s solar panel company, SolarCity.",
        "The Rio Olympics officially ended on Sunday, with the closing ceremony in Maracan\u00e3 Stadium. For the 11, 000 athletes who participated in the Rio Games, the closing ceremony marks the end of an intense two weeks of competition and the media attention that comes with it. Now they return to their lives away from the spotlight \u2014 either to eventually begin training for the Tokyo Games in 2020, or, for athletes who are retiring, to find a new career path. What is it like to go home after the intensity of the Olympics?",
        "Tuesday afternoon, Stephen Braun and Eileen Sullivan of the Associated Press released the results of a review of State Department appointment data that they used to make some striking claims about Hillary Clinton\u2019s schedule as secretary of state. According to their reporting, Clinton spent a remarkably large share of her time as America\u2019s chief diplomat talking to people who had donated money to the Clinton Foundation. She went out of her way to help these Clinton Foundation donors, and her decision to do so raises important concerns about the ethics of her conduct as secretary and potentially as president.",
        "It\u2019s hard to grapple with where the conservative movement is today without understanding Breitbart. com. The publication has long had a huge audience, but its larger influence became clear last week after Donald Trump appointed Breitbart\u2019s longtime chair, Steve Bannon, to be his campaign\u2019s CEO. Breitbart is now the publication of the Republican nominee for president in all but name. What it publishes explains a great deal of Trump\u2019s appeal \u2014 and is helping to define what \u201dTrumpism\u201d means. So what is Breitbart\u2019s oeuvre?",
        "Don\u2019t look at who Donald Trump says he\u2019s speaking to. Look at who\u2019s in the room when he says it. Yes, Trump has taken to addressing some portion of his stump speech to black voters. \u201dWhat have you got to lose?\u201d he rhetorically asks a hypothetical black audience. Yes, he\u2019s now calling Hillary Clinton \u201d a bigot who sees people of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future,\u201d as he did in a rally in Jackson, Mississippi on Thursday.",
        "In a presidential election cycle when the media has felt unusually free from the conventional constraints of \u201dboth sides\u201d reporting, mostly to Donald Trump\u2019s detriment, there is one issue where the mainstream press has been willing to take the gloves off against Hillary Clinton: press conferences. Specifically, Hillary Clinton does not hold press conferences. That doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t speak to the press \u2014 she\u2019s done lots of interviews \u2014 but she doesn\u2019t stand up, on or off camera, in front of the traveling Clinton campaign press corps and take questions in an unscripted setting.",
        "Over the past week, bail \u2014 that thing you pay to get out of jail while awaiting trial \u2014 has been in the news as the US Department of Justice declared the current bail system is unconstitutional, siding with a man in Georgia who was forced to spend six days in jail over a misdemeanor charge because he couldn\u2019t afford the $160 bail to get out. The idea behind money bail is to provide an incentive for someone to return to court, since he can recoup the cost if he comes back for required court appearances.",
        "It\u2019s increasingly clear that soda is one of the most worrisome food products on the shelf \u2014 it\u2019s a major source of added sugar in the American diet and it\u2019s consumed at perilous volumes that are contributing to obesity and diabetes. So it makes sense that, in recent years, health officials have been experimenting with taxes to try to curb the guzzling. In March 2015, Berkeley, California, became the first US jurisdiction to implement a 1 cent per ounce tax on soda. Other US cities have tried to pass similar measures, too, but in vain.",
        "In most years, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman\u2019s reelection bid would look like a sure bet. Portman is a popular Republican from a state that routinely elects Republicans to Congress. He faces no major scandals, has run a smart and campaign, and is leading his opponent by more than 5 points in basically every poll. But this is not a normal year. Donald Trump is getting creamed in Ohio \u2014 badly losing the state by about as much as his party\u2019s Senate candidate is winning it.",
        "For a long time, if you lived in America, there was a very good chance you\u2019d die of heart disease. For more than half a century, it\u2019s been far and away the leading cause of death here. In recent years, however, the picture has started to change. The gap is narrowing between deaths due to heart disease and deaths caused by cancer in the United States, according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After peaking in 1985, heart disease deaths have been falling (with a small uptick after 2010).",
        "If you\u2019re not Canadian, you may have looked at your Twitter feed this past weekend and wondered, \u201dWait, what\u2019s the Tragically Hip?\u201d On Instagram, you may have seen photos of a sweaty, leaping man in a feathered fedora and a rotating wardrobe of neck scarves and lam\u00e9 tracksuits, swaying onstage with a microphone before a packed stadium of thousands. Gord wishing us all \u201da nice life\u201d simple words meaning so much coming from him! Tragic & beautiful.",
        "The Department of Justice did something groundbreaking last week: It declared our nation\u2019s bail system unconstitutional. In a brief filed in support of a lawsuit challenging the bail system, the DOJ held that jailing people who are facing charges unless they can afford to post bail impermissibly discriminates against the poor. As a public defender in Oakland, I know all too well how much our bail systems are used as a way to lock up the poor while allowing the wealthy to avoid jail.",
        "Silicon Valley has a major housing crisis. The median price of a home in Palo Alto, home to Stanford University, has reached $2. 5 million \u2014 twice as much as five years ago. Housing in the region has grown so expensive that it\u2019s hard for young families to get their start there. Adrian Fine chairs the Palo Alto Planning and Transportation Commission, and he is running for the city council to try to address the city housing shortage.",
        "The EpiPen was invented in the 1970s by a biomedical engineer, Sheldon Kaplan, who was searching for a way to treat allergic reactions quickly. What he came up with was the EpiPen we know today: a device that delivers a premeasured dose of the hormone epinephrine in emergency situations. The device is ubiquitous in our country, carried by those with asthma or allergies. And since 2007, a drug company called Mylan has quietly hiked EpiPen\u2019s price by 400 percent. Sen.",
        "The National Security Agency is lying to us. We know that because of data stolen from an NSA server was dumped on the internet. The agency is hoarding information about security vulnerabilities in the products you use, because it wants to use it to hack others\u2019 computers. Those vulnerabilities aren\u2019t being reported, and aren\u2019t getting fixed, making your computers and networks unsafe. On August 13, a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers released 300 megabytes of NSA cyberweapon code on the internet."
