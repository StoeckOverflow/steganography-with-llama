        "Hillary Clinton did everything but call Donald Trump a racist in her speech today in Reno, Nevada. She said Trump \u201dbuilt his campaign on prejudice\u201d and pushed \u201d and ideas.\u201d She accused Trump of unleashing a \u201dsteady stream of bigotry.\u201d She attacked him for not caring about or understanding black America, for expressing racial invective toward a Latino judge, and for allying with \u201dracists who now call themselves \u2018racialists.",
        "On August 17, the University of Texas\u2019s community Twitter account, @universitycoop, took a break from its regular routine of posting photoshoots of happy campus life and touristy photos of students throwing their \u201dhorns up.\u201d (The school\u2019s mascot is the Texas Longhorn, and they rarely let you forget it.) It was the beginning of the fall semester, and among the cute #moovin jokes and scenic pictures of Austin, @universitycoop threw in a short video of sorority Alpha Delta Pi welcoming potential recruits to the house as part of the annual campus recruitment week.",
        "Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump of allying with racists and racist ideas in a widely anticipated speech Thursday afternoon. Speaking at a community college in Reno, Nevada, Clinton said Trump had brought a racist fringe into the \u201dmainstream\u201d in a way that no other major party nominee had in American history. \u201dOf course, there\u2019s always been a paranoid fringe in our politics, steeped in racial resentment,\u201d Clinton said, according to remarks released by the campaign before the speech. \u201dBut it\u2019s never had the nominee of a major party stoking it, encouraging it, and giving it a national megaphone.",
        "Update: France\u2019s top administrative court overturned the burkini ban Friday, according to the Associated Press. This week, photos emerged of four armed male French police officers demanding that a woman wearing a headscarf, long sleeves, and pants remove layers of her clothing at a beach in Nice.",
        "I\u2019ve spent the past week talking to lots of health care experts and economists about the future of the Affordable Care Act. Of all the people I spoke with, Princeton University health economist Uwe Reinhardt offered the most dire and pessimistic assessment of the marketplaces\u2019 future. Related Is Obamacare failing? Namely, he believes they\u2019ve already entered a death spiral and are heading toward total collapse. This seems to be a minority view among those who follow the marketplaces closely, but not one completely out of the mainstream.",
        "In the past 20 years, astronomers have found hundreds of planets scattered across the galaxy. Some of them, like are thought to be remarkably like our Earth: similar in size and orbiting in a zone warm enough to sustain life. The thing is, most of these are impossibly far away. It takes light \u2014 the fastest thing in the universe \u2014 1, 400 years to reach . We can never travel there.",
        "Paul Colford, vice president and director of media relations at the Associated Press, issued a statement Wednesday afternoon defending AP\u2019s reporting on Hillary Clinton\u2019s meetings with Clinton Foundation donors, which has been widely criticized (by me, for example) for some deeply misleading framing. The AP reported, with much heavy breathing and insinuation, about Clinton holding meetings as secretary of state with people who had also donated money to the Clinton Foundation. It did not, however, appear to uncover anything at all improper resulting from these meetings.",
        "For the among us, trips to the grocery store can be fraught. We want to buy what\u2019s best, but there are almost too many choices. Food companies know this. So they use a meaningless word to guide our choices: \u201dnatural.\u201d They put it on everything from chips to fruit snacks to cereal, and for good reason. The magazine Consumer Reports found that 62 percent of shoppers regularly look for \u201dnatural\u201d labels when grocery shopping.",
        "A letter from the University of Chicago\u2019s dean of students to the incoming students of the class of 2020 has been making the rounds on social media the past few days. Its purpose, I guess, was to let those students know they were in for a real education. More of a broadside than a welcome letter, the dean let the incoming students know that the university is totally committed to academic freedom and \u201dfreedom of expression\u201d from its faculty and students.",
        "Even while endorsing Hillary Clinton and ending his campaign, Bernie Sanders vowed his political revolution would go on to \u201dtransform America\u201d and fundamentally change its government. The path forward was obvious but narrow: Defeated in the presidential race, Sanders and his allies would have to try building their clout in Congress and at the state and local level, creating electoral within the Democratic Party that was more closely aligned with Sanders\u2019s priorities. It\u2019s only been a couple months, but that effort is off to a rocky start.",
        "If you want a quick overview of how confused and misled we are about what works for weight loss, you should read a new commentary in the Lancet. We often hear from different camps in the \u201ddiet wars\u201d claiming that their style of eating is superior to all the others. Usually, it\u2019s based on a single health measure: weight loss. Now obesity doctor Yoni Freedhoff and National Institutes of Health researcher Kevin Hall have arrived to dispel the squabbling.",
        "Before the director can shout, \u201dAction,\u201d to set in motion a complicated scene that\u2019s about to unspool on camera, somebody else\u2019s voice cuts in: \u201dThere\u2019s a horse on C camera!\u201d And there it is, in the background of the shot, lazily swishing its tail, grazing on the tall grass. We\u2019re supposed to be in the middle of the zombie apocalypse, in a world riven by death and destruction, and the horse could not care less. Can the horse be moved? asks the director. No, as it turns out.",
        "A growing backlash against the skyrocketing cost of EpiPens has led the company behind the lifesaving injectable medication to announce that the drug will become more affordable. Related America\u2019s health prices are out of control. These charts prove it. EpiPen manufacturer Mylan didn\u2019t cut the price of its drug after a congressman\u2019s letter revealed Monday that it had crept above $500. Instead, it\u2019s said it will offer patients, who use the hormone for allergic reactions, more financial help to obtain it.",
        "Nine years ago, Barbara lost her son, Dovon Harris, to gun violence in the streets of Los Angeles. And a little more than a month ago, she lost her surviving son, DeAndre Hughes, to the same kind of horrific gun violence. The loss of her first son opens Ghettoside, the incredible 2015 book by journalist Jill Leovy, who won the PEN Center USA\u2019s award for research nonfiction this week.",
        "\u201cBurkini? A Wetsuit but there\u2019s \u2018burk\u2019 in it so it\u2019s forbidden. Undress yourself\u201d That\u2019s just one part of the text on a powerful illustration by an artist who goes by @LaSauvageJaune on Twitter, which astutely depicts the way that women around the world risk scorn and moral judgment for almost any choice they make about their appearances. Her work was inspired by the \u201cBurkini bans\u201d \u2014 the relatively new ordinances in about 15 French towns that forbid beachgoers from wearing the swimsuits (essentially, wetsuits with hoods) that some Muslim women choose.",
        "During and before the four years Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, the Clinton Foundation run by her husband took tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments and corporations. Many of these donors had a lot riding on Clinton\u2019s decisions. Saudi Arabia gave the foundation up to $25 million, and Clinton signed off on a controversial $29 billion sale of fighter jets to the country. Oil companies gave the foundation around $3 million, and Clinton approved a lucrative gas pipeline in the Canadian tar sands they\u2019d long sought. We\u2019ve known the basics of this story for months now.",
        "New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue, in 1974. ( via Getty Images) Look at a photo of a street scene from the \u201970s or early \u201980s, and a lot of things look pretty much the same as today. Most of the buildings are similar. People\u2019s clothes, on the whole, aren\u2019t all that different, give or take a few shoulder pads. One thing stands out: all of the cars look super boxy, especially compared with the curving, rounded exteriors of virtually every car on the market today.",
        "It\u2019s Saturday night, and Heartbreakers is empty. The small bar, which holds 70 people at fire code capacity, is tucked away near the Amtrak station in Williston, North Dakota. During the oil boom that blessed the region in the that train brought prosperity to the town, with workers arriving to claim the spoils of overflowing black gold. But since the oil dried up near the end of 2014, there\u2019s less to go around these days.",
        "Paul LePage is Maine\u2019s governor. He also recently called a political opponent \u2014 a state representative \u2014 and left an furious voicemail, and later said he would like to shoot and kill that same state representative in a duel. According to the Portland Press Herald, a TV reporter suggested that State Rep. Drew Gattine, a Democrat, had called LePage, a Republican, a racist, and asked LePage how he felt about it. Upon hearing about it, LePage left Gattine a voicemail with expletives and homophobic insults: Mr. Gattine, this is Gov. Paul Richard LePage.",
        "For San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, this year\u2019s NFL season isn\u2019t going to be business as usual. When \u201dThe Banner\u201d played to kick off the team\u2019s third preseason game against the Green Bay Packers on Friday, Kaepernick took a stand against racial injustice by sitting down during the national anthem. \u201dI am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,\u201d Kaepernick told the NFL after the game.",
        "Carly Rae Jepsen just unleashed eight new contenders for song of the summer, sliding in right before the buzzer sounds with a new slate of from her critically acclaimed (if woefully underperforming) 2015 album, Emotion. The bouncy, flirty Emotion Side B, released on August 26, is presumably built from the 200(!) tracks she originally chose from when compiling Emotion. She must\u2019ve had a hard time narrowing them down, because all eight songs are just as strong as the ones that made it onto the original album.",
        "Top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin announced Monday that she\u2019s leaving her husband, the disgraced former Congress member Anthony Weiner: Just out: Statement from Huma Abedin regarding NY Post story on Anthony Weiner: pic. twitter. \u2014 Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) August 29, 2016 Abedin\u2019s statement doesn\u2019t give much of explanation, but the reason behind the split is obvious enough: Weiner was again caught sexting with another woman. The New York Post published the photos. The new revelations are arguably worse than anything Weiner\u2019s been caught doing before.",
        "Gene Wilder, who died today at 83 of complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease, was the consummate showoff. He could sing. He could dance. He could act. He could be hilariously funny. He was even an screenwriter. Every single one of those talents comes together in this famous bit from Young Frankenstein, which you will surely see in every single piece written about Wilder from now until the end of time. It involves Wilder\u2019s Dr. Frankenstein and Peter Boyle\u2019s Monster doing a little dance routine to \u201cPuttin\u2019 on the Ritz.",
        "In recent months, some large health insurance plans have quit Obamacare, including, most notably, Aetna and UnitedHealthcare. These exits have raised concerns that the Obamacare marketplaces will have very little competition 2017. One in four healthcare. gov counties will have just one insurance plan on the marketplace next year. But its also true there are areas (mostly those that are urban, with large populations) where the marketplaces remain quite competitive. The level of Obamacare competition, in 2017, will vary hugely from place to place.",
        "California has long prided itself on being a world leader on climate change \u2014 and with good reason. Within the United States, California is No. 1 (by far) in solar power and No. 3 in wind power. It boasts the carbon dioxide emissions per capita behind New York and Vermont.",
        "The University of Chicago sent a dizzying letter to its freshman class last week, pledging its allegiance to two principles: academic freedom and freedom of expression. The letter expressed this commitment by denouncing \u201d trigger warnings\u201d and \u201dintellectual \u2018safe spaces. \u2019\u201d To those unfamiliar with the UChicago\u2019s abysmal campus climate, a strong stance against echo chambers may seem reasonable. But marginalized students know that this declaration ignores the real problems on campus: sexual assault, racial profiling, and other troubling issues. I would know.",
        "There are a lot of reasons why Donald Trump managed to take over the Republican Party. One big reason, as Oliver Darcy notes in a recent Business Insider piece, is the conservative media establishment. Darcy argues that Republican elites encouraged conservative voters to embrace alternative, media outlets \u2014 which made them powerless when those outlets turned on them by backing Trump. Darcy\u2019s piece is thoughtful and well sourced, and you should read it in full. But it misses a basic part of the story.",
        "cars are coming faster than anyone expected just a few years ago. And America, according to a new Consult poll, isn\u2019t really ready for that. More Americans say they they\u2019re more worried about the prospect of cars than excited. They\u2019re afraid that the technology will take jobs away from taxi and truck drivers, and they\u2019re skeptical that the technology will save lives as supporters claim. Overall, just 32 percent believe that cars will improve the driving experience, compared to 48 percent who don\u2019t think so.",
        "Now that the head of Breitbart news, Stephen Bannon, is at the helm of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, the ideas once housed on the fringe, popular conservative news site are at the center of a presidential campaign. And no place is this more relevant than on Trump\u2019s signature issue: immigration. Trump has made immigration the centerpiece of his campaign. To date he has focused his campaign on keeping immigrants out \u2014 whether through a physical wall, banning Muslims from entering American borders, or sending undocumented immigrants back to their native countries.",
        "This throwaway line in a Washington Post article by Robert Costa about the latest split within the Donald Trump campaign over whether to on immigration is one of the more terrifying things I\u2019ve ever seen people inside a campaign admit about their candidate: Trump tends to echo the words of whomever last spoke to him, making direct access to him even more valuable, the people said, requesting anonymity to talk about internal campaign discussions. This is an absolutely terrifying trait in a potential president of the United States."
