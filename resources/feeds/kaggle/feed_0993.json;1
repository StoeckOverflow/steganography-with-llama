        "The Night Of finale, titled \u201dThe Call of the Wild,\u201d was profoundly unsatisfying television, providing nothing in the way of concrete resolution or definitive answers. Indeed, about the only actual \u201danswer\u201d we got is that Andrea\u2019s cat is safe. Good for the cat. Related Read our complete coverage of The Night Of But if you think that \u201dprofoundly unsatisfying\u201d means I didn\u2019t like the finale, you\u2019d be wrong.",
        "Once or twice a year, Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) founder Michael Liebreich posts a magisterial summation of some trend or set of trends in the energy world. His latest report ( with BNEF editor Angus McCrone) is about electric vehicles. It\u2019s worth reading the whole thing, but it was an aside about discarded EV batteries that caught my eye. In four or five years, the batteries in the roughly one and a quarter million EVs currently on the road are going to start to wane. EV owners will either replace them, or replace the cars entirely.",
        "We already know that solar power can be contagious. Studies have found that if you install a rooftop solar system, it increases the odds that your neighbors will too. Now along comes tantalizing evidence that electric vehicles have a similar dynamic. When charging stations are more visible, people become much more likely to consider buying a car: Placing charging stations at workplaces, where cars spend much of their time, will be uniquely powerful.",
        "Few awards shows live up to their hype, but the MTV Video Music Awards have almost always been an exception to that rule. Ever since the first show in 1984, the VMAs have been good for some performances, prime celebrity watching in the audience, and, if they\u2019re lucky, the kinds of moments that keep people dissecting their layers for years to come. The 2016 awards were a decidedly mixed bag, though.",
        "Originally published on Grist. When the news started to spread about a plan to release genetically engineered mosquitoes in the Florida Keys, it seemed laughable. The idea was to release hordes of engineered male mosquitoes that would mate with the females and cause them to produce eggs. The average Facebook post on this was something like: \u201cLOL, you\u2019ve got to be kidding me. \u201d I don\u2019t see that reaction much anymore. A poll out this week found that 60 percent of Florida residents support tweaking mosquitoes\u2019 genes to fight diseases, while 30 percent opposed.",
        "In 1997, after a distinguished career in military service that culminated with stints as national security adviser under Ronald Reagan and chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton, Colin Powell launched a charity. Named America\u2019s Promise, it\u2019s built around the theme of Five Promises to America\u2019s children. And while I\u2019ve never heard it praised as a particularly way to help humanity by effective altruists, it was surely a reasonably good cause for a famous and politically popular man to dedicate himself to.",
        "Donald Trump is scheduled to give a major speech on immigration Wednesday in Arizona, finally attempting to settle what has become a surprisingly difficult question: What would President Donald Trump do on immigration? For the first 14 months of his presidential bid, it was fairly straightforward: Build a wall, make Mexico pay for it, deport unauthorized immigrants, and restrict legal immigration in the name of national security. These days? LOL, nope.",
        "Yesterday, the internet lost its mind over the news that Russian astronomers had detected a spike in radio signals, apparently from the vicinity of a sunlike star known as HD 164595. The star is just 94 light years away and is known to have one planet. The media quickly speculated about aliens: \u201dNot a Drill: SETI Is Investigating a Possible Extraterrestrial Signal From Deep Space,\u201d noted the Observer. \u201dIf the signal is truly from an alien world, it\u2019s one far more advanced than ours.\u201d Twitter ran wild with the news. Scientists, however, are far more skeptical.",
        "Nancy Roman, president and CEO of the Capital Area Food Bank, has been overwhelmed by cake. Week after week, dozens of frosted, layered confections arrive at her warehouse. A might think this is a dream come true. But for Roman, it\u2019s a nightmare. The cakes are donations meant to be passed along to the food bank\u2019s end users \u2014 more than half a million residents of Washington, DC, and its Maryland and Virginia suburbs who don\u2019t have enough to eat. Like other Americans, many of these folks struggle with obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and pressure.",
        "\u201dWhat the hell do you have to lose?\u201d In the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s most feverish attempt yet to improve his dimming presidential prospects, I\u2019ve been giving some thought to his elegantly worded appeal to black and brown folk. The gist of the marketing pitch: Since black and brown lives are already so miserable, how much worse could they get if Trump were elected president? \u201dWhat do you have to lose? What do you have to lose? You\u2019re living in poverty, your schools are no good.",
        "A majority of Republicans now want a . A new poll by the Huffington Post and YouGov shows that 54 percent of Republican and voters now say that Donald Trump was not the best choice for the GOP nomination, up from 44 percent in June. Meanwhile, the number of Republican voters who say Trump was the best option fell from 44 to 35 percent. In comparison, 53 percent of Democratic and voters say Hillary Clinton was the Democrats\u2019 best option, compared to 56 percent in June.",
        "The teen birthrate has plummeted rapidly since the \u2014 and a new study suggests better use of birth control is entirely responsible. There are 42 percent fewer teen births now than just seven years ago. In 2007, 4. 2 percent of teenage girls in the United States gave birth. In 2014, the rate was 2. 4 percent. This is an incredibly fast change in a public health trend, and it\u2019s left some researchers puzzled over how it happened so quickly. But researchers Laura Lindberg, John Santelli, and Sheila Desai say it\u2019s not a mystery at all.",
        "On Monday, Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin announced that she was separating from her husband Anthony Weiner. The cause of the split: a third sexting scandal, revealed by the New York Post, in which Weiner sent graphic photos of himself lying next to his sleeping toddler son. The political press went bananas with the story. News of the breakup led the home pages of the New York Times, CBS News, CNN, and just about everywhere else you looked (including Vox). \u201d\u201d ran Fox News\u2019s headline.",
        "In Concord, North Carolina, a group called Racists Anonymous has been meeting for the past month. It\u2019s based in Trinity United Church of Christ fellowship hall, and the organizers are hoping other congregations follow their lead and start holding their own meetings. They say their membership is growing all the time. That\u2019s according to Tanya Mendis and Xavier Walton, reporters for North Carolina\u2019s WCNC, who reported on the group last week \u2014 and tweeted out this picture from its headquarters.

        "The goal of a \u201csafe zone\u201d is a laudable one: to protect civilians from attacks in a designated area. But despite its misleadingly simplistic name, establishing a \u201csafe zone\u201d in Syria would put civilians in even greater danger and risk prolonging Syria\u2019s bloody nightmare. Safe zone proponents and opponents alike can agree that the failure of the international community to end the war in Syria is one of the greatest moral outrages of our time. But in trying to stop the carnage, we owe it to Syrians to not put their lives in even greater jeopardy.",
        "At Recode\u2019s annual Code Conference in June, venture capitalist Elon Musk made the provocative argument that reality is not reality at all, but a massive simulation built on top of some other reality. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance we\u2019re living in base reality,\u201d he said. Musk\u2019s idea isn\u2019t a new one: Philosophers and science fiction authors have been toying with versions of it for years. But part of what made Musk\u2019s notion interesting was that it rested entirely on a simple extrapolation from the trajectory of the video game industry. \u201cForty years ago we had Pong,\u201d he said.",
        "Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff has just been impeached. On Wednesday, the Brazilian Senate voted to remove her from office. Vice President Michel Temer will now takeover as president for the forseeable future. On the surface, the impeachment charges were about allegations that Rousseff cooked the government\u2019s books to hide the scope of Brazil\u2019s deficit problem during her 2014 reelection campaign. But they were really about a bigger slate of problems in Brazil \u2014 most importantly, something called the Petrobras scandal.",
        "Real estate businesses always operate with debt, and one thing that happens when your business is saddled with debt is that you might find yourself \u201dunderwater.\u201d In other words, your company\u2019s debts to the banks are larger in value than the price of the real estate assets your company owns. This can happen if a sharp downturn in land prices or a sharp rise in interest rates unexpectedly shocks the foundations of your business. It can also happen just because you\u2019re a poor manager who made bad decisions. But it happens.",
        "Hillary Clinton has a healthy lead over Donald Trump in the polls. Republicans look likely to lose control of the Senate. Could Democrats hit the trifecta \u2014 and also take back the House of Representatives this fall? It\u2019s not impossible. Even though most analysts think it\u2019s unlikely \u2014 Democrats would need to pick up 30 seats, including in reliably Republican territory \u2014 there is one political analyst who has a theory of how it could happen.",
        "This week was supposed to be Donald Trump\u2019s big week on education. At least, that was the plan before the controversies and confusion of last week\u2019s \u201dimmigration week\u201d stuck around to steal education\u2019s spotlight. But there is some indication that Trump\u2019s going to emphasize education more in the future. He\u2019s chosen a policy adviser on education. \u201dEducation, education, education!\u201d he declaimed at a rally in New Hampshire last week, roughly tripling the number of times he usually mentions the topic. Still, where previous candidates had policy papers, Trump has punchy sentences.",
        "It\u2019s no secret that Americans have gotten much, much bigger over the past few decades. The signs are all around us, from XXXL clothing sizes to supersize movie seats and even coffins. According to the latest analysis from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the average American man now stands at inches tall and weighs 196 pounds \u2014 up 15 pounds from 20 years ago. For women, the change has been even more striking: The average female today stands inches and weighs 169 pounds. In 1994, her scale read 152 pounds.",
        "When you apply for a job, you\u2019d like to think that you\u2019re evaluated based on your skills, experience, and track record. But in a recent article published by the Harvard Business Review despairingly titled \u201cWe Just Can\u2019t Handle Diversity,\u201d it was revealed that candidates are evaluated not solely on merit (as we often aspire and hope) but also on . Interviewers frequently assessed candidates inconsistently according to race, e.",
        "The exit of large insurance plans from the Affordable Care Act marketplaces is likely to hit rural areas of the country the hardest. A new Vox analysis shows that the number of rural counties on the Healthcare. gov marketplace with just one insurer will nearly quadruple between 2016 and 2017. In 2016, 7. 8 percent of rural counties reported one insurer available. But in 2017, that number is expected to rise to 30. 7 percent.",

        "The title of the 2016 documentary Weiner cheekily nods to the sophomoric giggles induced by the surname of its subject, disgraced former Congress mayoral object lesson Anthony Weiner. But if Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg\u2019s political documentary were named for what really defines the film, it would probably be called Huma.",
        "At the end of his immigration speech Wednesday, Donald Trump stepped away from the podium to make way for people he called \u201dangel moms.\u201d A line of bereaved parents and relatives, their shirts plastered with the faces of lost loved ones, lined up behind him. Trump stood aside as one by one the parents \u2014 \u201dangel moms\u201d \u2014 shared stories of losing a son or daughter to an \u201dillegal alien.\u201d \u201dMy son Ronald da Silva was murdered April 27, 2002, by an illegal alien who had been previously deported,\u201d one \u201dangel mom,\u201d herself an immigrant, said.",
        "For roughly a day now, Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling has been in a bitter fight with her Twitter followers. The row has nothing to do with wands or Dumbledore\u2019s sexuality. It\u2019s all about UK politics \u2014 and it sheds a lot of light on what\u2019s happening in that country. Rowling, in case you aren\u2019t familiar with her politics, is one of the UK\u2019s most famous progressive voices.",
        "A crisp and clear vocal performance is a vital component of all genres of popular music. So when Kanye West recorded his debut single, \u201dThrough the Wire,\u201d with his jaw completely wired shut after a car accident, he was taking a huge risk. When you listen to \u201dThrough the Wire,\u201d you immediately hear that Kanye \u201dchipmunk soul\u201d in his sample of Chaka Khan\u2019s \u201dThrough the Fire.\u201d But you also hear Kanye riff: Yo, Gee, they can\u2019t stop me from rapping, can they? Can they, Hop? His voice is muffled and lispy. It\u2019s not clear at all.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s immigration speech in Phoenix Wednesday night couldn\u2019t have been clearer: If you live without papers in America, you should live in fear. Imagine you were watching Trump\u2019s speech tonight not because you\u2019re following the campaign for kicks or even because you take your right to vote seriously, but because you had to \u2014 at least, if you wanted to understand what you and your family might have to live through for the next four years. I know, I know. According to Donald Trump, this kind of thinking is exactly the problem.",
        "American exceptionalism has been propelled by exceptionally free markets, so it\u2019s tempting to think the United States has a freer economy than Western European countries \u2014 particularly those Scandinavian social democracies with punishing tax burdens and lavish, even coddling, welfare states. As late as 2000, the American economy was indeed the freest in the West. But something strange has happened since: Economic freedom in the United States has dropped at an alarming rate. Meanwhile, a number of welfare states have become at least as robustly capitalist as the United States, and maybe more so. Why?"
