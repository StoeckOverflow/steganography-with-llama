        "Donald Trump flew to Mexico yesterday for a meeting with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. After the meeting, Trump said that he and the president did not discuss the question of who would pay for Trump\u2019s proposed wall on the US \u2014 Mexican border. Then Trump went to a rally in Phoenix where he delivered a deranged, ranty speech about the evils of immigration and reiterated that Mexico will pay for the wall. Early this morning on Twitter, he again made his point clear. Mexico will pay for the wall! \u2014 Donald J.",
        "If the election were held today, Hillary Clinton would almost certainly become America\u2019s next president. Clinton continues to lead Donald Trump by a substantial margin in the vast majority of polls. It\u2019s not really even close: Clinton is up by about 5 points in the polling averages that most experts see as the best way to gauge the true state of the race. Still, the race certainly has tightened over the last few weeks.",
        "\u201dI want to work as hard as I can to make marijuana completely legal in this country before the end of my life,\u201d Jesse Ventura declared in a recent interview.",
        "Russia is sending tens of thousands of troops to military installations near its border with Ukraine and holding snap military drills, sparking fears that a Russian invasion is imminent. These fears are overblown, however, for one major reason that everyone seems to have overlooked: The Ukrainian military of today is very different from the ramshackle, demoralized force of 2014. In 2014, Ukraine\u2019s government, led by Viktor Yanukovych, collapsed as pressure grew for the country decisively to ally itself with the West. In response, Russia seized the Crimean Peninsula and stirred up a phony rebellion in the southeastern Donbas region.",
        "Known and Strange Things, a new collection of essays by Teju Cole, is a testament to its author\u2019s voracious consumption of culture. Cole is a novelist, art historian, and photographer, and his essays run the gamut of his obsessions. Over the course of the book, he describes having dinner with the Nobel Prize \u2014 winning author V. S. Naipaul, experiencing Barack Obama\u2019s election night in Harlem, and retracing James Baldwin\u2019s steps through Switzerland. But Cole is at his most precise and incisive in the book\u2019s second section, \u201cSeeing Things,\u201d when he turns his attention to the visual arts.",
        "Georgetown University did something remarkable this week. The university issued a set of plans to \u201creconcile\u201d (quoting Georgetown President John J. DeGioia) its role in benefitting from slavery. The plan is a response to work done by the institution\u2019s \u201cSlavery, Memory, and Reconciliation\u201d committee, convened in 2015. And it is part of a larger movement among colleges and universities to acknowledge their pasts as well as how wealth from slavery built many of our nation\u2019s greatest institutions.",
        "Earlier this year, director Nate Parker was on top of the world \u2014 his upcoming film, The Birth of a Nation, had been heralded by critics as a masterpiece. Today, Parker is under fire for initially downplaying resurfaced sexual assault allegations from a woman who accused him of rape 17 years ago. Now a top actress in Parker\u2019s movie is speaking out: Gabrielle Union responded to the rape allegations in the Los Angeles Times on Friday.",
        "If you\u2019ve been spending your money on fancy antibacterial soaps in the hopes that they\u2019ll keep you clean and healthy, you may want to stop. The US Food and Drug Administration just released a new, exhaustive report and ruling that there\u2019s actually no good evidence they perform any better than plain old soap and water when it comes to preventing illness or the spread of bacteria and viruses. What\u2019s more, the agency is banning companies from using 19 common \u201dantibacterial\u201d chemicals \u2014 such as triclosan and triclocarban \u2014 in products going forward.",
        "Nobody expected a Republican presidential candidate would use primary airtime to compliment Planned Parenthood. Or feature a primetime speaker who bragged that the nominee would close the gender wage gap. Or make child care the subject of his first big economic proposal. Donald Trump has done all three \u2014 guided by Ivanka Trump, his daughter, who has played an unusually active role his campaign. \u201cHe will fight for equal pay for equal work,\u201d Ivanka Trump said at the Republican National Convention. \u201cI will fight for this too, right alongside of him.",
        "Lenny Letter \u2014 the email newsletter curated by Lena Dunham and her Girls producer Jenni Konner \u2014 released an interview between Dunham and Amy Schumer today. But reading it feels less like reading a Q&A and more like eavesdropping on a conversation between two frustrated friends \u2014 which, of course, is exactly the point.",
        "Suppose someone said you could cut global poverty by within a year or so \u2014 without waiting for economic growth to do the job. Sound unbelievable? A generation ago it may have been, but today it\u2019s entirely possible, given the new public and private financial situations emerging in developing countries. It continues to be widely asserted that developing countries don\u2019t have the economic capacity to make a dent in poverty through redistribution. But our research suggests that is no longer so \u2014 whether extreme poverty is defined as $1. 90 a day (the World Bank\u2019s figure) $2.",
        "NASA\u2019s Earth Observatory has posted some staggering photos of the vanishing Aral Sea. The lake, tucked between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, was once the in the world. Today, after decades of being drained for irrigation, it\u2019s nearly gone. The lake dwindled to its smallest size ever in August of 2014: \u201dFor the first time in modern history,\u201d NASA noted at the time, \u201dthe eastern basin of the South Aral Sea has completely dried.\u201d Things have rebounded slightly since then, but only slightly.",
        "Sign up to volunteer for Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, and you might be giving up more than you bargained for. Earlier this week, reporters began poring over the nondisclosure agreement that Trump\u2019s campaign requires its volunteers sign. The forms are extraordinarily broad, virtually prohibiting any volunteers from criticizing Trump or his family for the rest of their lifetimes, according to Rachel Sklar, a lawyer who has also written for and appeared on CNN.",
        "Colin Kaepernick\u2019s public protest against racial injustice has been intensely debated over the past week on social media, in editorials, and on sports radio. But it\u2019s the response from inside the NFL to the San Francisco 49ers quarterback\u2019s refusal to stand during the national anthem at last Friday\u2019s preseason game against the Green Bay Packers that\u2019s perhaps been most revealing.",
        "Eric Lichtblau of the New York Times has a blockbuster story out today revealing that newly disclosed emails raise some important questions about links between Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department and the Clinton Foundation, a nonprofit that her husband ran at the time. That\u2019s quite the headline and lead. So what\u2019s the story? Well, beneath the huffing and puffing, here it is: In March 2009, two American journalists, Euna Lee and Laura Ling, were arrested in North Korea. In June of that year, they were sentenced to 12 years of hard labor.",
        "It\u2019s a hurricane! No, it\u2019s a tropical storm. No, it\u2019s. .. a hurricane again? The storm system known as Hermine can\u2019t seem to make up its mind. But either way, it could prove extremely dangerous to the and East Coast in the days ahead. Back on Thursday, Hermine became a Category 1 hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico, with 80 mph winds. It was the first hurricane in 11 years to make landfall in Florida, leaving one dead and 250, 000 people without power.",
        "For some time now, the Washington Post\u2019s David Fahrenthold has been looking into the neglected subject of Donald Trump\u2019s charitable giving. And most recently he\u2019s found out that Trump\u2019s charitable foundation made an illegal campaign contribution to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (this reporting is based, in turn, in part on work done by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington). Then when they found out they had broken the law, they kinda sorta corrected the error but didn\u2019t actually follow their legal obligation to get the money back. It\u2019s all at least a little suspicious.",
        "The commission on presidential debates today announced the moderators for the 2016 presidential and vice presidential debates. The selections offer us one of the most diverse sets of debate moderators that we\u2019ve ever seen, but also close out with a debate that\u2019s going to be solo moderated by a Fox News anchor \u2014 raising the specter of the kind of partisan and ideological slant generally avoided in this kind of situation. The first presidential debate will be on September 26, moderated by NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt.",
        "We might think of elections past as and staid, but American politics has been wild and raucous from the beginning. John Dickerson, a political columnist at Slate and the host of CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, makes that point over and over again in his podcast, Whistlestop, which explores turning points and famous moments from past presidential campaigns. In his new book, Whistlestop: My Favorite Stories From Presidential Campaign History, Dickerson draws out the themes that recur in American campaign history \u2014 how candidates collapse, how they beat expectations, and how they tap into deep feelings within the electorate.",
        "Labor Day weekend is a glorious opportunity to get outside, eat a hot dog, and take a walk with a loved one. Or perhaps you\u2019d rather be productive by finally finishing the chores you\u2019ve been avoiding, or just cooking a lovely meal or two. Of course, you can also just forget all that, stretch out on a couch, and catch up on the approximately 20, 000 TV shows you\u2019ve fallen behind on, like a true patriot.",
        "Earlier this year, a college student\u2019s prison sentence triggered nationwide outrage \u2014 former Stanford University student Brock Turner was sentenced to a measly six months in jail after he sexually assaulted an unconscious woman. The outcry was so widespread that it inspired California legislators to pass a bill this week that would require at least three years in prison for those convicted of sexual assault against an unconscious or intoxicated person. The bill, which still needs Gov.",
        "In the latest episode of MTV\u2019s Decoded, comedian Franchesca Ramsey and five guests show that racial stereotypes aren\u2019t just bad because they\u2019re gross mischaracterizations. It turns out many familiar stereotypes were completely flipped from what they are today. \u201dWhile some people believe racial and ethnic stereotypes are based on some sort of unchangeable truth about how people really are, a lot of the stereotypes we have today used to be the exact opposite\u201d of how we perceive groups now, Ramsey says.",
        "If there was any remaining doubt that North Carolina\u2019s voting restrictions \u2014 which require a photo ID to vote and limit early voting days \u2014 are about disenfranchising black people, recent comments by a top Republican consultant in the state should put that doubt to rest. William Wan reported for the Washington Post: Longtime Republican consultant Carter Wrenn, a fixture in North Carolina politics, said the GOP\u2019s voter fraud argument is nothing more than an excuse. \u201cOf course it\u2019s political.",
        "The second season of Narcos, Netflix\u2019s historical drama about drug lord Pablo Escobar and the law enforcement officers who worked to bring him down, is a marked improvement over the first \u2014 which I didn\u2019t like very much. Rating 3. 5 And yet as I got deeper into it, I grew more and more frustrated with the series all the same. Season two builds to a suitably grand climax \u2014 no spoilers here, but, uh, if you know anything about Pablo Escobar, you can probably guess what I\u2019m referring to. This is not to say you shouldn\u2019t watch it.",
        "Last year, during the early days of the presidential campaign, Donald Trump boldly promised, \u201cI\u2019m gonna win the Hispanic vote. \u201d The past few days have suggested he was wrong. After Trump\u2019s immigration speech focused on deporting millions of unauthorized immigrants and building a wall at the US \u2014 Mexico border, several of his top Latino advisers resigned or threatened to resign. And a new, huge survey shows Trump isn\u2019t just losing the Latino vote \u2014 he\u2019s losing it by far more than the past few decades of Republican presidential candidates.",
        "In October 2007, at a rare appearance at a packed Carnegie Hall, Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling casually tossed off one of the biggest announcements in the history of her landmark fantasy phenomenon: Dumbledore, Harry\u2019s mentor and the greatest wizard in the world until his dramatic death in book six, was gay. The audience immediately leapt to its feet and roared its approval. Rowling seemed surprised.",
        "San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick\u2019s national anthem protest has exposed a deep divide over something all too many Americans take as a typical part of modern life. \u201dI am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,\u201d Kaepernick told NFL Media\u2019s Steve Wyche. \u201dTo me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way.",
        "Nowadays, Labor Day is marked by barbecues and odes to the end of summer, along with relatively simple parades that feature workers marching in celebration. For the most part, it\u2019s a summer bookend rather than a raucous party. But it wasn\u2019t always that way. Labor Day parades began in the late 19th century as celebrations of different trades, with laborers pulling out all the stops to show off what made their line of work unique. And that required some of the greatest parade floats of all time.",
        "Labor Day is a day of rest that commemorates years of war. Congress inaugurated the holiday just days after President Grover Cleveland sent 12, 000 federal troops to break the Pullman strike. The tactics were bloody; US deputy marshals killed two men and wounded many more. That was 1894, an election year. Cleveland needed a way to win workers back to his side. He saw an opportunity in a federal holiday honoring workers \u2014 as well as organized labor. \u201dThe movement for a national Labor Day had been growing for some time,\u201d writes PBS NewsHour.",
        "\u201cCan I give you a call?\u201d It\u2019s the worst possible reply to an email, but one I receive all too often in the course of reporting. Phone calls are journalistically indispensable when you want to conduct an extended interview, but for a routine query or point of clarification, email is much, much better. Besides which, like any person born in the 1980s, I hate phone calls. The issue is that administration officials and other executive branch aides don\u2019t want to leave a record of the conversation that might come to light one day."
