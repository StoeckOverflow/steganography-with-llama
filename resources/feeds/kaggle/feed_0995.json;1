        "Five years ago, right as the Tea Party was becoming a major force in American politics, Arlie Russell Hochschild realized she didn\u2019t really know any conservative Republicans. Ensconced in her liberal outpost at the University of California Berkeley, the famed sociologist understood little about the lives or beliefs of a huge swath of the country.",
        "Amazon\u2019s websites are hawking a universe of dangerous, pseudoscience health products \u2014 from electronic \u201dzappers\u201d that promise to cure HIV to bleach enemas for autism. That\u2019s according to an investigation by UK\u2019s Sun newspaper, which accuses the internet giant of profiting off people\u2019s desperation and illness by selling unproven, products. In a quick search of Amazon. com, I found that many of the dubious products mentioned in the Sun\u2019s story are also available to US consumers. For example, at the click of a button, consumers can order Dr.",
        "All contraceptives are to be covered without a copay. That was the promise of the Affordable Care Act when it passed in 2010. The specific provision regarding contraceptive coverage took effect in 2013. Advocates and policymakers repeat this assertion all the time. But I know, as many practicing physicians do, that it is not as simple as that. I currently work primarily with patients \u2014 now at a clinic in Indianapolis, and previously at one in California. I am reminded every day how hard it is for my patients to obtain birth control.",
        "FBI Director James Comey stunned reporters back in July when he laced into Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. \u201dThere is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,\u201d Comey said of Clinton and her team. The FBI cleared Clinton of any criminal wrongdoing in connection with its investigation, saying it couldn\u2019t prove that she had knowingly exchanged classified information on her private email server.",
        "Across developed societies, the issue of immigration has pushed its way toward the top of the political agenda. A large section of the public is concerned about how many newcomers are arriving (and also about who is arriving) and we can see the effects of this in the rise of Donald Trump, in the recent referendum vote in the UK to leave the European Union, and in the rise of parties in a number of European societies \u2014 even Sweden.",
        "In an early episode of The Simpsons, Homer walks with Marge through downtown Springfield. \u201dCareful now,\u201d he admonishes his wife. \u201dThese are dangerous streets for us types.\u201d This is Homer\u2019s first admission to being \u201d \u201d \u2014 but for the rest of us, this always seemed obvious. Homer has all the trappings of a stereotypical American: He lives in a modest home in the suburbs with his wife and three children. He works a factory job while his wife Marge tends to the children and cooks. He is not a college graduate.",
        "When Jonathan Safran Foer published his first novel, Everything Is Illuminated, in 2002, he became an instant literary sensation. He was just 25 years old, and his debut \u2014 about a young Jewish man traveling through Ukraine \u2014 was the talk of the town. The New York Times said it was extraordinary. Susan Sontag said it made her laugh. It won the National Jewish Book Award. Here I Am, out today, is Foer\u2019s third novel, and the first he\u2019s published in over a decade. So it comes with certain expectations.",
        "On August 30, Russian astronomers announced they had detected a radio signal from HD 164595 \u2014 a star away from Earth. The SETI (search for extraterrestrial intelligence) Institute fired up upon hearing this news, this possibility for alien life. Scientists eventually determined it to be a \u201dterrestrial disturbance.\u201d I\u2019d like to think that somewhere near HD 164595, aliens finally got their hands on a torrented copy of David Ayer\u2019s majestic disaster Suicide Squad.",
        "Originally published on Grist. China and the US really want you to know we\u2019re in it together on climate change. On Saturday, Presidents Obama and Xi Jinping formally joined the Paris climate agreement in a joint event in China, giving the deal a big boost from the two top polluters. The future of the climate agreement is something of a numbers game: 55 countries representing 55 percent of global greenhouse emissions must ratify it before the deal becomes official. China and the US together represent 38 percent of global emissions.",
        "It\u2019s rare to be able to pinpoint the exact moment when a movie goes wrong, but it\u2019s possible to do so with Morgan, the new horror film from director Luke Scott (the son of Ridley). Rating 2. 5 For roughly its first Morgan is a deeply intriguing movie with one question at its center: Did Morgan, an artificial life form played by Anya (whom you may remember as the protagonist of The Witch) harm one of the scientists caring for her because she\u2019s been constructed incorrectly and is, thus, inherently violent?",
        "It\u2019s true: The next iPhone won\u2019t have a headphone jack. Apple just made the announcement at an event in San Francisco. While the rumored change has been debated for months in the tech media, it\u2019s still going to come as a shock to millions of ordinary iPhone users who can\u2019t imagine life without the ubiquitous 3. 5 mm headphone jack. While many people will grumble about the change, Apple argues that it will actually make users better off in the long run.",
        "The Dallas Morning News broke with more than 75 years of tradition on Wednesday morning to endorse a Democrat for president, choosing Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. And in doing so, they got right to the point: \u201dThere is only one serious candidate on the presidential ballot in November,\u201d the editorial began. \u201dWe recommend Hillary Clinton.\u201d The Dallas Morning News\u2019 editorial page is very, very conservative. It hasn\u2019t endorsed a Democrat for president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1940.",
        "Stranger Things season two is really happening, and we now have a teaser trailer and a premiere date \u2014 Halloween \u2014 to prove it. The \u2019 Netflix thriller was one of the most TV shows of last summer, in part due to its nostalgic appeal and heavy reliance on references and homages to classic \u201980s horror and . And from the looks of the new trailer, which dropped during the Super Bowl, the show\u2019s feel will continue apace.",
        "Appearing on CNN, former anchor Soledad O\u2019Brien appeared to criticize the network and other news outlets for normalizing white supremacy through their coverage of Donald Trump. \u201cListen, I\u2019ve seen on air white supremacists being interviewed because they are Trump delegates,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cAnd they do a segment \u2014 the first minute or so talking about what they believe as white supremacists. So you have normalized that. \u201d O\u2019Brien later clarified that she is not wading into the question of whether Trump is a racist.",
        "It\u2019s official: there won\u2019t be a headphone jack in the iPhone 7. Instead, if you want to play music on an iPhone 7, you\u2019ll either have to use wireless Bluetooth headphones or plug new headphones (or an adapter) into the port you use to charge the device. The downsides are obvious: Almost everyone has headphones, speakers, and other gadgets based on the ubiquitous 3. 5 mm headphone jack. Eliminating this connection could render these devices unusable, or at least force everyone to carry around an extra adapter. But Apple doesn\u2019t care.",
        "With about two months left in the campaign, the national race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump has gotten closer, but Clinton still appears to be solidly ahead in more than enough swing states to deliver her the presidency. Yes, the race seems to have tightened since Clinton\u2019s peak in the early August period. At that time, Hillary Clinton\u2019s lead over Trump in national polls rose to around 8 to 9 points on average, and now appears to be something more like 3 to 5 points. Trump has even led the occasional poll lately.",
        "Phyllis Schlafly, who died Monday at the age of 92, was revered by social conservatives and reviled by liberals. She was a staunch and believer in the \u201ctraditional family\u201d who helped shape the culture wars about family, community, identity, and equality we\u2019re still having today. And she\u2019s more responsible than anyone for the fact that the Constitution doesn\u2019t have an Equal Rights Amendment in it today. After she died, she was, predictably, revered and reviled in most of the expected places. But historian Kevin M.",
        "While most Americans were busy celebrating Labor Day, Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte was busy insulting their president. After Obama criticized Duterte\u2019s human rights record at a press conference over the long weekend, Duterte called him a \u201cson of a whore. \u201d Duterte apologized, but it was too late: On Tuesday morning, Obama canceled a planned summit between the two presidents. This isn\u2019t the first time Duterte has done something like this. In 2015, after a papal visit caused a traffic jam in Manila, Duterte called Pope Francis \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 a \u201cson of a whore.",
        "Labor Day is over. The summer months are behind us. And the campaign season (which feels like it\u2019s been going on for a year and a half) is now truly underway. The next 61 days are the real scramble for control of the White House, the Senate, and House of Representatives. Polls have jumped up and down in the past few months, from the bump each candidate got to their leveling out a few weeks later. But now polls are really going to start to show us where the race is headed.",
        "More than once while watching Queen Sugar, I realized I\u2019d been holding my breath \u2026 and then let out a long, satisfied exhale. Rating 4. 5 There isn\u2019t much TV that can compel me to sit down and embrace its world like I\u2019m sinking into a hot bath, but that\u2019s exactly what it feels like to watch the warm and Queen Sugar. Under creator and director Ava DuVernay\u2019s careful and deeply empathetic watch, it\u2019s the rare family drama that feels both incredibly intimate and wonderfully grand.",
        "Over the past few years, Franchesca Ramsey has established herself as one of the best sources for fearless, intersectional social commentary. A former writer and \u201cHash It Out\u201d contributor on The Nightly Show, Ramsey used her unflinching satire to break down sexist backlash against the latest Ghostbusters reboot or call out Piers Morgan\u2019s criticisms on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade. And as host of MTV\u2019s weekly series Decoded, she\u2019s paired her wit and comedic prowess to provide clarity on everything from whitewashing the Stonewall Riots in 1969 to myths about the Black Lives Matter movement.",
        "The summer 2016 movie season was a disappointment by almost any measure. As is now required for the hottest months, Hollywood treated audiences to yet another plodding procession of sequels and remakes, franchise starters and extenders, reboots and reimaginings, too few of which provided even the most basic cinematic pleasures: romance, excitement, escapism, comedy, spectacles worth projecting on a screen. Most summer movie seasons are built on formulaic productions, but this one felt worse somehow \u2014 as if the old formulas suddenly no longer worked.",
        "What Donald Trump said at Wednesday night\u2019s Forum on the aircraft carrier was shocking. He specifically defended Vladimir Putin as superior to Barack Obama, suggested women serving in the military should expect to be raped, hinted at a political purge of the officer corps, blatantly lied about his own past statements on Iraq and Libya, and called on the American military to commit war crimes. To top it all off, he pedantically corrected a veteran about the number of suicides by American military personnel \u2014 and he got the number wrong; the veteran was right all along.",
        "During a Thursday appearance on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson was asked about the city of Aleppo, the site of a major front in the Syrian civil war. Johnson responded with a question: \u201cWhat is Aleppo?\u201d This wasn\u2019t some kind of weird dodge \u2014 it\u2019s clear he actually doesn\u2019t know what Aleppo is. In a interview, Johnson was given a chance to explain himself. It didn\u2019t go well: When you recognize what\u2019s going on in Syria, when you recognize that Aleppo is in kinda the epicenter between . .. Aleppo!",
        "Political journalism trends toward equivalence. There is the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, and while they diverge in ideas, the media assumes they share their foibles and flaws, their minor and major corruptions, their grasping and opportunistic politicians. This is the foundational premise upon which political coverage rests: The policies of the two parties are different, but the institutions and personnel are broadly similar. We can argue whether that\u2019s true in any year (Matt Grossmann and David Hopkins\u2019s Asymmetric Politics marshals considerable evidence that it isn\u2019t, I think) but it\u2019s definitely not true in this year.",
        "Donald Trump insists he opposed the Iraq War before it began. His main piece of evidence? \u201cYou can look at Esquire magazine from \u201904,\u201d Trump said during the NBC News candidate forum on Wednesday night. Well, if you do look at the Esquire piece Trump was referencing \u2014 which he wrote for the magazine \u2014 it now comes with a very big disclaimer: Editor\u2019s note: The following story was published in the August 2004 issue of Esquire.",
        "The biggest problem for me, as a reporter covering not just Donald Trump but Trumpism, has been how to explain the racial and cultural anxieties many Trump supporters feel without either excusing or dismissing them. Sociologist Arlie Hochschild, who spent five years in conservative white rural Louisiana \u2014 the sort of communities that eventually became Trump Country \u2014 does just that in her interview with Vox\u2019s Brad Plumer. You should read the whole interview.",
        "Nancy Pelosi is getting visions of reclaiming her House gavel. In an interview published by Politico on Thursday, the House minority leader said she is becoming increasingly optimistic that the Democratic Party might take back the House of Representatives in November. They\u2019ll need to flip 30 seats controlled by the Republicans to do so. \u201cI thought in December I would\u2019ve told you we\u2019d win 20 seats, left to our own devices,\u201d Pelosi said in an interview with Politico\u2019s Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer.",
        "The reporter\u2019s job is to \u201dcomfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable\u201d \u2014 a credo that, humorously, was originally written as a smear of the nature of journalists. And so the justification for going after a public figure increases in proportion to his or her stature. The bigger the figure, the looser the restraints. After a quarter of a century on the national stage, there\u2019s no more comfortable political figure to afflict than Hillary Clinton. And she\u2019s in for a lot of affliction over the next year and half.",
        "With each passing year, the world has fewer and fewer pristine natural spots, as cities, roads, farms, mines, logging, and other industrial activities have pushed into nearly every corner of the planet. A new study in Current Biology reports that Earth has lost 10 percent of its wilderness since the early 1990s \u2014 an area twice the size of Alaska. \u201dThe amount of wilderness loss in just two decades is staggering and very saddening,\u201d said lead author James Watson of the University of Queensland."
