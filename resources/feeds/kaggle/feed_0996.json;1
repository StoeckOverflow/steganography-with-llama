        "When Apple unveiled the original Apple Watch 18 months ago, it was supposed to be a device for everyone. Rich people and celebrities would get the \u201dWatch Edition,\u201d with prices starting at $10, 000. Middlebrow watch enthusiasts would pay more than $1, 000 for a stainless steel version. More frugal users and fitness buffs would get the $349 Apple Watch Sport. People would see notifications of incoming emails and text messages. They\u2019d be reminded of upcoming appointments. They\u2019d be able to summon Uber rides and check in for upcoming flights. They\u2019d use it for health and fitness tracking.",
        "If you\u2019ve followed the latest from the world of neuroscience, you might get the impression that the field is in deep trouble. In July, a report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences declared that as many as 40, 000 papers using the standard tool in neuroscience research, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) could suffer from a statistical flaw that rendered their results to be a false positive.",
        "Costa Rica is pulling off a feat most countries just daydream about: For two straight months, the Central American country hasn\u2019t burned any fossil fuels to generate electricity. That\u2019s right: 100 percent renewable power. This isn\u2019t a blip, either. For 300 total days last year and 150 days so far this year, Costa Rica\u2019s electricity has come entirely from renewable sources, mostly hydropower and geothermal. Heavy rains have helped four big hydroelectric dams run above their usual capacity, letting the country turn off its diesel generators.",
        "Both the fan and critical responses to Mr. Robot\u2019s second season have been pretty blas\u00e9 compared to all the adulation heaped on the show\u2019s first season, which blew nerd minds with creator Sam Esmail\u2019s incredibly specific narrative vision and stubbornly affected aesthetic. The primary complaints against season two have been that it\u2019s too slow, too wrapped up in its own tricks, and too scattered outside the hacking that made it compelling in the first place.",
        "We are more than a year into the Zika outbreak, and the virus is spreading in the US and overseas. But Congress still hasn\u2019t moved to fund the effort to beat it back. On Tuesday, the Senate once again failed to pass the $1. 1 billion Zika funding package. This is pathetic \u2014 but it\u2019s also emblematic of how much the public health system depends on politics and how badly it needs financial independence from the political system.",
        "If you\u2019re lucky enough to catch a lift with San Francisco \u2014 based Uber driver Stroy Moyd, you\u2019ll get more than a ride across town. Inside his car, you\u2019re greeted with a faceful of confetti (actually newspaper) and he explains to you that you\u2019ve just unwittingly become a participant on his game show, Rideshare the Love. You\u2019re handed an iPhone containing a prerecorded video message from one of your close friends. In said message, your friend explains that she\u2019s set you up on an date. The video ends.",

Gary Johnson doesn\u2019t know what Aleppo is; Matt Lauer doesn\u2019t know how to moderate; Wells Fargo customers didn\u2019t know they had 1. 5 million accounts secretly opened in their names \u2014 but got charged for the fees anyway.",
        "North Korea has tested its fifth nuclear weapon \u2014 one more powerful than any device it has tested previously. What does this mean for the world? To find out, I got in touch with Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. Lewis is an expert on North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, so what he has to say carries real weight. And what he had to say was scary.",
        "Summer is almost over, but it doesn\u2019t mean body shaming has to be. Despite being busy pounding pumpkinless pumpkin spice lattes, a woman can still make time to internalize the opinions of strangers regarding her personal choices. After a summer of debating whether women are wearing too few clothes (ew, tramp!) or too many (ew, national security threat!) autumn is finally upon us to offer women some relief from decoding the various moral meanings arbitrarily ascribed to their clothing. But being a modern woman is hard work. Who has the time to navigate society\u2019s contradictory standards of modesty?",
        "For months, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota has been waging a pitched battle against a proposed oil pipeline that would run near their reservation \u2014 arguing that it would endanger both their water supplies and sacred sites. These protests have become a huge, huge story. The fight over the Dakota Access Pipeline encompasses everything from the federal government\u2019s historically appalling treatment of Native Americans to broader debates about fracking and climate change. The cause has attracted an array of tribes, activists, and environmentalists around the country, and authorities have been clashing with protestors all summer.",
        "This has been a rough year for pollsters and pundits, with prediction after prediction going painfully awry. Even those supposedly unflappable data journalists have found themselves stepping in it. But it\u2019s not just the journalists and pollsters. Since I\u2019m a professor of statistics as well as a blogger who often comments on academic papers that I think misuse numbers, I have a seat to some of the least persuasive academic takes on politics and elections. And it\u2019s been a big year for bad studies. In journalism and polling, premature obituaries of Trump have been one common problem.",
        "The workforce analytics firm Visier has published a fascinating analysis of the gender wage gap using the salaries and positions of 165, 000 workers at large American companies. It suggests one major driver of the workforce is that when women hit their 30s, they stop getting promoted into management positions at the same rate as men. You can see what it looks like in this chart, which shows the percentage of men and women in management positions at different ages.",
        "On September 12, 2001, friends and family asked me, a terrorism expert, whether would hit us again. Almost 15 years later, the same question hangs in the air, albeit with ISIS substituted for . Back in 2001, I predicted that another attack on the United States was likely. Thankfully, I was wrong. The fact is that, for a number of reasons, the US homeland today is safer than it was 15 years ago. This does not mean the US homeland is immune to terrorism: Orlando and San Bernardino are only the latest reminders that terrorism remains a real concern.",
        "Two seemingly unrelated cases in the news this week share a troubling link. Brock Turner, the infamous former Stanford student who was convicted of sexual assault of an unconscious woman, was released from jail after three months last Friday, reviving outrage over his sentence. Just days later, the Jacob Wetterling case \u2014 in which a young Minnesota boy was abducted, assaulted, and murdered 27 years ago \u2014 came to a close, as his murderer confessed to the crime.",
        "\u201cThe secret history of the heroin crisis,\u201d Don Winslow writes at Esquire, is rooted in marijuana legalization. Specifically, Winslow claims that because marijuana legalization in Colorado and other states depleted drug cartels\u2019 revenues \u2014 by pushing marijuana out of the black market \u2014 the cartels shifted their production over to heroin instead. As a result, heroin has flooded the streets of America, creating an epidemic.",
        "Buried in the middle of this widely cited Deadline article about the terrible 2016 summer movie box office was a statement that might make readers blink and adjust their eyeglasses, like an old person in a cartoon: But don\u2019t blame studios and the creative community for misreading audience tastes. This summer had the highest number of films that scored 60 or higher on Rotten Tomatoes.",
        "If you finish watching a movie and let the ending credits scroll for a while, you\u2019ll come across the actors who are merely identified as descriptors \u2014 \u201dbridesmaid #1,\u201d \u201dman in donkey suit,\u201d or \u201dhot dog vendor.\u201d Upon first glimpse, these roles seem inconsequential; after all, these are characters that weren\u2019t even important enough to get names. But a deeper look at these credits reveals a dramatic difference in the roles Hollywood ascribes to female and male \u201dday players\u201d (actors whose roles are unnamed in the credits).",
        "Public trust is critical when it comes to vaccines. When people lose their confidence in immunizations and see them as useless, unhelpful, or downright harmful, they are less likely to get the lifesaving shots. And when people don\u2019t get their immunizations, terrible, diseases like measles or whooping cough are more likely to flare up. In a new study, published in EBioMedicine, researchers at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Imperial College London, and the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health in Singapore tried to measure vaccine confidence around the world.",
        "TV is about to lose one of its weirdest, creepiest, and best teen shows. The TV network Freeform, n\u00e9e ABC Family, announced last fall that the current season of Pretty Little Liars will be the show\u2019s last. Tonight, the show will air its midseason premiere, heading into its final stretch of episodes before the series finale. The news is neither unexpected nor entirely unwelcome, even for fans of the show. The main cast\u2019s contracts were all set to expire after season seven, and none of the cast was likely to return.",
        "Sunday marks the anniversary of the attacks on the United States. Because the terrorists responsible were linked to groups that claimed allegiance to their version of Islam, the tragedy launched the religion \u2014 which until then had been a minority faith in the US \u2014 abruptly into the national dialogue, where it was often lazily linked to violence and sentiment. As a result, the date of the attacks has become widely understood as a catalyst for the rapid deepening of Islamophobia in America.",
        "This weekend marks the 15th anniversary of the attacks. It\u2019s hard to overstate how transformative that event was for this country. It has defined our politics ever since. In 2011, the RAND Corporation published a collection of essays called The Long Shadow of . The aim was to examine the legacy of from a variety of perspectives \u2014 military, fiscal, social, cultural, and policymaking.",
        "Late on Friday, the United States and Russia came to a massively important agreement: After months of seemingly failed negotiations, they agreed to a joint plan for ending the war in Syria. The proposal, announced by Secretary of State John Kerry and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, is incredibly ambitious. The basic idea is for the US and Russia to get the Syrian rebels and the Syrian government, respectively, to stop fighting each other temporarily \u2014 so the US and Russia can start jointly attacking both ISIS and an group in Syria more effectively.",
        "This year\u2019s Republican and Democratic National Conventions yielded an unexpected takeaway: Most Americans don\u2019t know much about slavery. On the latest episode of her MTV web series Decoded, comedian and activist Franchesca Ramsey highlighted the unfortunate tendency many Americans have to ignore or erase the role slavery played in the country\u2019s past. \u201dWe talk about race a lot on this show,\u201d Ramsey said.",
        "Samsung is facing a major product safety crisis in the face of multiple reports of one of its most popular smartphone models exploding during charging or use. The company halted sales of the product last week, and now the US Consumer Product Safety Commission is urging customers who bought a Note 7 to immediately stop using it and power it down in an unusually blunt tweet: Stop using @SamsungSupport Galaxy #Note7. Full statement: https: . pic. twitter. \u2014 U. S. CPSC (@USCPSC) September 9, 2016 Here\u2019s what you need to know. Are phones really exploding?",
        "September 11, 2001, is widely understood as a marker of deepening Islamophobia in America. While that\u2019s perhaps oversimplified, the attacks did set off a series of political and social reactions that have worked together to fuel fear and ignorance about what it means to follow Islam. I spoke to nine Muslim Americans about how misunderstandings, stereotypes, and hateful rhetoric about their religion has affected their lives over the past 15 years. Their experiences vary with age, race, geography, and the visibility of their faith.",
        "On March 10, 2003, during a London stop on a worldwide tour, Dixie Chicks lead singer Natalie Maines addressed the crowd. It was the eve of the US invasion of Iraq, and Maines spoke directly on the subject looming in everyone\u2019s mind: \u201dJust so you know, we\u2019re on the good side with y\u2019all,\u201d Maines said. \u201dWe do not condone this war. This violence. And we\u2019re ashamed that the president of the United States is from Texas.\u201d The locals howled and clapped in solidarity.",
        "Donald Trump went on CNBC this morning, and, over the course of a interview, once again reminded the world of the most fundamental fact about his candidacy: He doesn\u2019t really seem to understand any aspect of American public policy. Benefiting as he often does from a cable news format, he was allowed to ramble and dissemble across a variety of topics \u2014 including who sets interest rates, how monetary policy impacts the economy, and how his own money is invested, finding time for a racist personal attack against a rival politician.",
        "In the past week, thousands of conservatives have heard and heeded a warning: America has been hijacked \u2014 and electing Donald Trump is their last chance to storm the cockpit before it crashes. The warning came from the website of the Claremont Review of Books, an but intellectual conservative publication. It\u2019s called \u201cThe Flight 93 Election\u201d \u2014 a reference to the only plane hijacked on that didn\u2019t make it to the hijackers\u2019 destination. It begins: 2016 is the Flight 93 election: charge the cockpit or you die. You may die anyway.",
        "Hillary Clinton collapsed at a ceremony midday Sunday, prompting the usual wild speculation about her health status. When her campaign finally announced that she had actually been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday, the pneumonia punditry began. professionals of all stripes weighed in on how she should proceed and why she took so long to disclose the serious illness, and suggested medical . Never gotten more angrier responses from tweeters ever than when I said she should have disclosed having pneumonia on Friday.",
        "Hillary Clinton on Friday described Donald Trump supporters in what she acknowledged were \u201dgrossly generalistic\u201d terms: \u201dYou could put half of Trump\u2019s supporters into what I call the \u2018basket of deplorables.\u2019 Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic \u2014 you name it.\u201d Was Clinton right? It\u2019s impossible to say what\u2019s in people\u2019s hearts and minds, but we do have a lot of evidence from a number of nonpartisan polling firms \u2014 such as Gallup, the Pew Research Center, Reuters, and YouGov \u2014 that have asked Trump and Clinton supporters about their views on race, religion, and ethnicity."
