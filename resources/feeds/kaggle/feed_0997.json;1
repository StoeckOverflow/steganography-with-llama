        "Randall Munroe, the author of the webcomic XKCD, has a habit of making wonderfully lucid infographics on otherwise difficult scientific topics. Everyone should check his take on global warming. It\u2019s a stunning graphic showing Earth\u2019s recent climate history. Take some time with it. Stroll through the events like the domestication of dogs and the construction of Stonehenge. And then ponder the upshot here. There\u2019s a common line among climate skeptics that \u201d[t]he climate has always changed, so why worry if it\u2019s changing now?\u201d The first half of that sentence is undeniably true.",
        "The sugar industry has a long history of shaping nutrition policy in the United States, working to mask the potential risks of consuming too much of the sweet stuff. It wasn\u2019t until this year, for instance, that the US Dietary Guidelines finally recommended people keep their consumption of added sugars below 10 percent of their total calorie intake \u2014 decades after health advocates began pressing for the measure. The sugar lobby had fended off this recommendation all the while.",
        "The first presidential general election debate is on Monday. And with the polls as tight as they are, some Democrats and liberals are feeling a gnawing sense of anxiety that these upcoming debates could throw the election to Donald Trump. But that gets to a bigger question political scientists have been grappling with for many years: How much do the debates even matter, anyway? The evidence isn\u2019t entirely conclusive, but in my read of it, debates have the potential to make a small but real impact on the race.",
        "The revelation that Hillary Clinton has come down with pneumonia is just the latest reason Democrats have to be nervous about a presidential race that\u2019s grown uncomfortably close. To be clear: Clinton remains ahead of Donald Trump in most polls, both nationally and in almost every swing state, and she continues to have the advantage in forecasting models. Plus, her campaign operation appears to be far superior to Trump\u2019s. She\u2019s still the clear favorite, and it\u2019s not time for a Democratic panic.",
        "Near midnight on September 2, 1859, the sky burned blood red. Firefighters in New Orleans stood at the ready, thinking a great blaze had broken out. The waters of the San Francisco Bay shimmered and danced, lit with crimson, while thousands of miles away in New York City, crowds gathered in the street to watch the show. As the rosy glow brightened to blot out the stars, campers in the Rocky Mountains awakened and, supposing it was dawn, groggily argued over whether to make coffee. The sun would not rise for another six hours.",
        "On Thursday, Donald Trump will appear on The Dr. Oz Show to \u201dshare his vision for America\u2019s health,\u201d as the show\u2019s teaser promises. He\u2019ll also divulge more details from his medical records to the TV doctor, according to the show\u2019s reps and Fox News. We don\u2019t know exactly what will transpire between these two, but it is hard to imagine how this coupling will yield anything good for public health or reason. Trump is known to draw from pseudoscience to make provocative claims on television. Dr.",
        "brought America into a new era of fear. As Vox\u2019s Alvin Chang explains, after the attacks, American\u2019s level of fear stayed permanently elevated, despite the fact the world has become arguably safer. It\u2019s a testament to the subtle psychological power of fear. Events like like the Boston Marathon bombing, like the Paris massacre, like the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, all have the power to change the way we see the world and think about others.",
        "At this moment, some 1. 3 million people from 164 different countries are in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, performing the hajj, the Islamic religious pilgrimage \u2014 including, according to the US State Department, approximately 15, 000 Americans. It\u2019s a huge event \u2014 in terms of both its significance in Islam and the massive logistical challenge of having that many people from all walks of life and every corner of the globe descend on one relatively small place all at once. But what actually goes on at the hajj? What is its religious and political significance?",
        "For 45 years \u2014 longer if you count his work as an actor \u2014 Clint Eastwood has been churning out gruff, efficient movies about gruff, efficient men: stories of strong and silent heroes and antiheroes who do their work, mull their regrets, and live with the consequences. His heroes show up, get the job done, and then go about their business, hoping to leave the world a little bit better in the process.",
        "Welcome to The Big Idea, Vox\u2019s new home for scholarly (but never ) excursions into the most important issues and ideas of our time. Vox\u2019s core mission is to explain the news, and its fleet of staff writers work hard, day in and day out, to make good on that promise. But The Big Idea is less about the stories that drive today than the policies and philosophies that should drive tomorrow.",
        "Donald Trump runs a charitable foundation named after him that\u2019s been good for his personal business and political aspirations and appears to have no particular philanthropic mission or focus. It has, however, been used to pay out over a quarter of a million dollars to help settle lawsuits on behalf of Trump\u2019s private businesses \u2014 just one of several ways in which Trump has used tax exempt nonprofit money in ways that violate the letter or the spirit of the laws governing charity in the United States.",
        "During a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton in Philadelphia on Tuesday, President Obama sharply criticized the media\u2019s recent coverage of Donald Trump, saying journalists were creating false equivalence between Trump and Clinton while failing to hold Trump to task for various \u201ddisqualifying\u201d statements he has made. \u201dDo you mind if I just vent for a second?\u201d Obama asked.",
        "Trump\u2019s ban on travel from six Muslim majority countries, temporarily reinstated by the Supreme Court on Monday morning, is supposed to stop terrorists from getting in to the US. But there\u2019s precious little evidence that immigrants and refugees actually pose a serious terrorist risk to the United States. A September report, from Cato Institute analyst Alex Nowrasteh, is one of the most sophisticated attempts to investigate this question. What it found was striking: The number of immigrants who commit terrorist attacks is astonishingly tiny. Cato is a libertarian think tank that has a noticeably stance.",
        "If you consult the US Census, the South comprises 16 states and Washington, DC. It starts at Texas and Oklahoma in the West, pushes up against the Ohio River with Kentucky and West Virginia, and ends at the Atlantic Ocean with Delaware. Wait \u2014 Delaware? Really? I had long considered the South everything below the line, a boundary survey that represented the line of freedom for black people escaping slavery, combined with the effects of the Missouri Compromise of 1820. So that would include states like Maryland, Missouri, and West Virginia, as well as DC \u2014 but not Delaware.",
        "Speaking at the Values Voter Summit on Saturday, Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin alluded to Thomas Jefferson\u2019s famous aphorism about the need to periodically water the tree of liberty with the blood of patriots and tyrants. Except in Bevin\u2019s telling, the tyrant is Hillary Clinton: Somebody asked me yesterday, I did an interview, and they said, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible, if Hillary Clinton were to win the election, do you think it\u2019s possible that we\u2019ll be able to survive?",
        "Welcome to Dear Julia, a column where readers submit everyday health questions. Which painkillers work best? Is it better to run or walk for exercise? Why do the parents of young kids get sick more often? Julia Belluz sifts through the research and consults with experts in the field to figure out how science can help us live happier and healthier lives. Dear Julia: Do I actually have to drink eight glasses of water a day?",
        "Correction: This article originally reported that urban households had seen their median incomes rise in 2015, while incomes in rural areas fell. But that appears to have reflected a statistical anomaly in the Current Population Survey. More reliable data released later in the week by the American Community Survey \u2014 another program of the Census Bureau \u2014 found that median household income in rural areas gained 3. 4 percent, while urban and suburban households gained 3. 6 percent. The text below has been corrected.",
        "Last week, I wrote about new research showing that partisan polarization on climate change is worse than ever. In a nutshell, fewer than half of US Republicans acknowledge anthropogenic climate change or worry about its impacts. This is rather alarming for people who would like the US political system to take action to address the problem. And at least a few of those people are Republicans. Take North Carolina billionaire businessman Jay Faison, who announced last year that he was setting up the ClearPath Foundation to put $175 million toward convincing Republicans and moderates to support climate change solutions.",
        "What is happening in Britain? First there was Brexit, and now \u2014 far worse, it could be argued \u2014 comes the slow toppling of Britain\u2019s greatest cultural achievement bar none: The Great British . Or, as it\u2019s known on these benighted shores, The Great British Baking Show. First, the BBC announced Monday that it had lost its license to air . And today it announced that the show\u2019s hosts, Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins, will not be returning to their posts next season. Related The Great British Baking Show comes back July 1. Its timing couldn\u2019t be better.",
        "San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the national anthem last night before his team\u2019s nationally televised football game against the LA Rams. This was of little surprise. He made headlines last month by refusing \u201cto stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color\u201d before a preseason game, and he\u2019s been repeating his protest ever since. Others have joined in, to include several NFL players from various teams, Seattle Reign soccer star Megan Rapinoe, and three West Virginia University Tech female volleyball players.",
        "What happens if one of the presidential candidates has to drop out of the race before Election Day? Both Republicans and Democrats have roughly similar \u201dbreak in case of emergency\u201d contingency plans that would force a few hundred party bigwigs into an extraordinary and unprecedented position. They\u2019d decide the fate of the race, with only a few ambiguous rules to help them chart their course forward. To be clear: We have no reason to believe Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will bow out.",
        "In any given film, there are dozens of actors whose roles are unnamed in the credits \u2014 \u201dnurse #1\u201d or \u201dman with balloons,\u201d for instance. Their job is to go unnoticed, yet they are integral to the realism of cinema: In the background, they mill about naturally and seamlessly, transporting us into their world. Last week, we took a look at the gender differences between the most common roles given to these background actors.",
        "In a fabulous Washington Post this week, design guru Tim Gunn blasted the fashion industry\u2019s unwillingness to \u201cmake clothes to fit American women\u201d \u2014 specifically women. The average American woman now wears between a size 16 and 18, Gunn pointed out, but many clothing designers and merchandisers still refuse to produce anything larger than a 12. From a commercial standpoint, this refusal is baffling \u2014 they\u2019re ignoring a whole lot of women, and leaving a whole lot of money on the table as a result.",
        "Polls released over the past few days show Hillary Clinton losing to Donald Trump in several key swing states, in a trend that should set off alarm bells for Democrats. These new polls, from several different outlets, show Trump ahead in some states where he hasn\u2019t led any polls in months, and some are the best general election poll results Trump has ever gotten. Here\u2019s the rundown: In Iowa, a new Monmouth poll shows Trump winning by a massive 8 points.",
        "Former Secretary of State Colin Powell thinks Donald Trump is a \u201dnational disgrace\u201d and Republicans\u2019 Benghazi investigations are a \u201dwitch hunt,\u201d according to leaked personal emails of his that have been posted by several media outlets. About two years\u2019 worth of Powell\u2019s emails were apparently stolen and posted at a shady website called DCLeaks, which may well be connected to Russian intelligence in some way.",
        "It was slowly becoming real. I\u2019d received a message from a Facebook recruiter over LinkedIn in July 2010. In August, I had phone interviews and then an interview. A week after the I received an offer letter. Facebook, the company that touched the lives of more than 400 million people per month, wanted to relocate me, my wife, and our infant daughter from Arizona to Silicon Valley so that I could work on the site reliability operations team. It was my dream job, in a place that always had an almost mythical allure to me.",
        "Monsanto. It\u2019s hard to even say the name without triggering a fierce reaction. The company has long been the public face of GMOs, thanks in part to the sheer dominance of its corn, soy, cotton, and other crops engineered to be resistant to the herbicide Roundup. And pretty soon, Monsanto may no longer exist. At least not in its current form. On Wednesday, the German chemical conglomerate Bayer offered to buy up Monsanto for $56 billion, in what could prove to be the largest corporate merger of the year. Monsanto has accepted the bid.",
        "On Monday, Qiu Bai, a student from the city of Guangzhou, China, took the Chinese Ministry of Education to court in Beijing to demand that it change the way college textbooks talk about homosexuality. Right now, most of them call it a disease. The trial went mostly as Qiu had expected. A government official said the language in the textbooks did not infringe on her rights as a gay student, and refused to respond directly to her complaints that the textbooks were spreading false \u2014 and potentially dangerous \u2014 information.",
        "Does he get the linguistics right? That\u2019s the question many may expect a linguist to answer about Tom Wolfe\u2019s The Kingdom of Speech, a chronicle in high Wolfean about \u2014 to put it narrowly \u2014 a debate between linguists about sentence structure. Sound dull? On one level, it\u2019s an intermural academic catfight \u2014 one that I confess I never expected to see cast in the format of Wolfe\u2019s classics Radical Chic and the Flak Catchers.",
        "A new census report released this week had some great news for the average worker. Headlines mostly focused on the jump in median wages \u2014 a 5. 2 percent increase from 2014 to 2015, the largest the agency has ever seen. This is undeniably good news. But some other good news didn\u2019t get as much attention \u2014 namely, that the uninsured rate is at an low. The Census Bureau estimates that 9. 1 percent of Americans lacked health insurance in 2015, the lowest number the agency has ever recorded. This was a 1."
