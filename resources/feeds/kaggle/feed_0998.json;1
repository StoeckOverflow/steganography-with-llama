        "President Obama is the first sitting president to call himself a feminist. His administration is the most diverse in history because he\u2019s made an effort to fill the majority of top policy appointments in his executive branch with women and people of color. But a fascinating anecdote, reported by Juliet Eilperin in the Washington Post on Tuesday, reminds us that even feminists like Obama can still harbor unconscious gender biases: When President Obama took office, of his top aides were men. Women complained of having to elbow their way into important meetings.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has found possibly the most bizarre attack so far against Hillary Clinton: She doesn\u2019t care as much about policy as he does. It started Tuesday in Iowa, when Trump claimed Clinton is running \u201ca campaign. \u201d Then Ivanka Trump picked it up: \u201cThere\u2019s no policy on Hillary Clinton\u2019s website pertaining to any of these issues, child care, eldercare, or maternity leave or paternity leave for that matter,\u201d she said, in remarks first noted by ThinkProgress. \u201cThere\u2019s no policy that\u2019s been articulated on how to solve the problem.",
        "Donald Trump is expected to turn serious questions about his health into a TV performance on The Dr. Oz Show tomorrow, revealing tidbits about his penchant for fast food and his exercise regimen \u2014 instead of detailed medical records. According to a press release from the show, Dr. Oz reviewed the results of Trump\u2019s recent physical exam, and then did his own review of the presidential nominee\u2019s health profile, including his cardiovascular health and family medical history. That exam was conducted by Dr.",
        "Donald Trump is about to be the first Republican nominee to say that women should be guaranteed six weeks of paid maternity leave after they give birth, Sopan Deb of CBS reported this morning: Interesting, a Trump aide tells reporters Trump will unveil childcare plan tonight that would guarantee 6 weeks of paid maternity leave. \u2014 Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) September 13, 2016 The problem, as Deb goes on to report, is that Trump seems to have no clue how he\u2019ll pay for it.",
        "It\u2019s not really in character for Hillary Clinton to speak in terms of vivid imagery, creative metaphors, or striking turns of phrase. But she did it over the weekend, setting off a growing firestorm of controversy that\u2019s defined the week in politics. \u201cYou know,\u201d Clinton said to a friendly crowd of wealthy donors this weekend, \u201cto just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump\u2019s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic \u2014 you name it.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s ongoing campaign to paint Donald Trump as unacceptable in the eyes of most Americans is working. It\u2019s just not good enough. That\u2019s the message of the spate of recent polls showing a dramatically tightened race that Trump may even be narrowly winning. The truth is that Trump is not doing well. Even Trump\u2019s very best recent polls (which, by definition, are outliers that likely overstate his true level of support) show him receiving fewer votes than Republican candidates usually get.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s appearance on The Dr. Oz Show Thursday merged the worst of Trump\u2019s reality television showmanship with the worst of Dr. Oz\u2019s medical schtick. The key moment came when \u201dAmerica\u2019s doctor\u201d asked Trump: \u201dIf your health is as strong as it seems . .. why not share your medical records?\u201d The Republican presidential candidate looked at the audience and said, \u201dWell, I have really no problem doing it. I have it right here. Should I do it? I don\u2019t care.",
        "Glenn Greenwald thinks something weird and dangerous happens to the American media during a presidential election. \u201cThings get way more polarized than they typically are. And way more tribalistic. Everything gets interpreted through this lens of, \u2018Which side are you helping, and which side are you on? \u2019\u201d says Greenwald, a of the investigative news site the Intercept who is best known for breaking Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations about the National Security Agency, in an interview.",
        "Ivanka Trump is used to gentle treatment from women\u2019s magazines. When she was just a vice president in her father\u2019s company and a career guru for young women, she got softball questions and flattering headlines from Vogue, Elle Decor, and People. But now that she\u2019s a political surrogate, the gloves are off, as her most recent interview, with Cosmopolitan\u2019s Prachi Gupta, on Donald Trump\u2019s new plan for maternity leave makes clear.",
        "Donald Trump has thus far declined to follow the precedent set by the past 40 or so years\u2019 worth of presidential campaigns and release copies of his recent tax returns. He says the reason for this is that his returns are under audit by the IRS, an explanation that lawyers and accountants find baffling \u2014 there\u2019s no reason audited returns can\u2019t be released to the public. Speaking to the Pittsburgh Tribune, Trump\u2019s son cleared things up admirably. Donald Trump Jr.",
        "The unemployment rate is 4. 9 percent. Consumer sentiment is back at its 1996 level. The Census Bureau says median incomes jumped by more in 2015 than in any year on record. Poverty is down. Inequality is declining. Health insurance coverage is up. We are far, far outpacing our peer nations. But I can feel myself trying to write it. The paragraph. The \u2019 paragraph. Male labor force participation remains low. median household incomes are below their 1999 peak. Plenty of people have been left behind by this recovery.",
        "Tyre King, a boy, was pursued as a robbery suspect \u2014 and his BB gun was mistaken for a real firearm \u2014 on Wednesday night when a Columbus, Ohio, police officer shot and killed him. Columbus police officers responded to a call about an armed robbery on the night of Wednesday, September 14. According to Columbus police, the victim said a group of people approached him and demanded money. One of the robbers allegedly had a gun, the Associated Press reported.",
        "There are fewer newspapers more solidly Republican than the New Hampshire Union Leader, the daily newspaper in Manchester. But for the first time in a century, the paper\u2019s editorial board isn\u2019t endorsing a Republican for president. Instead, the paper is urging readers to vote for Libertarian Gary Johnson, with an additional message from its publisher blasting Donald Trump: The man is a liar, a bully, a buffoon. He denigrates any individual or group that displeases him.",
        "I come not to praise Tuesday\u2019s census report but to bury it. Or at least question its methodologies. The Census Bureau\u2019s annual report was almost NSFW reading for econ wonks. It showed that 2015 was the best year on record for household income growth, with the median American household\u2019s income leaping 5. 2 percent in terms, and both poverty and inequality falling. The news had the Obama administration\u2019s economic team popping champagne corks, and sympathetic pundits like Jonathan Chait saying it will cement Obama\u2019s legacy as a successful and transformative president. And all that may be true.",
        "The Great Recession and its aftermath shattered the policy consensus on economics. What would come next? It\u2019s taken a while, but we\u2019re witnessing the emergence of an important new vision. Before the crash, complacent Democrats, whatever their disagreements with their Republican peers, tended to agree with them that the economy was largely . The Federal Reserve possessed the tools to nudge the economy to full employment, they thought. What\u2019s more, government programs, while sometimes a necessary evil, were likely to be an inefficient drag compared with the private market.",
        "American gymnast Simone Biles was an indomitable force at the Rio Olympics, helping the US women\u2019s gymnastics team win gold and crushing the individual vault, and floor events. She ultimately took home four gold medals and one bronze medal, making history as the first American woman to win four artistic gymnastics gold medals in a single Olympics. No matter how she does in future competitions, she will be remembered as one of the most dominant gymnasts and Olympians ever to compete. Someone wanted to tarnish that reputation.",
        "Ryan Holiday is an entrepreneur, marketing strategist, and author of Trust Me, I\u2019m Lying and The Obstacle Is the Way. His latest book, Ego Is the Enemy, may be his most interesting yet. Using various historical figures as case studies, Holiday illustrates the perils of egotism and explains how is our greatest impediment. I spoke with Holiday recently about his new book, his love of Stoic philosophy, and why he thinks ego is everyone\u2019s enemy. Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows. Sean Illing You write that you hope people think less of themselves after reading this book.",
        "Canada is trying a radical approach to treating heroin addicts who prove to be resistant to other forms of treatment: let them have heroin. Last month, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government quietly enacted new rules that will let doctors prescribe heroin to addicts, Alan Freeman reported for the Washington Post. The change will, specifically, allow the Crosstown clinic in Vancouver, Canada, to expand a program that lets heroin users go to the clinic \u2014 frequently multiple times a day \u2014 to safely inject pure heroin. This isn\u2019t an entirely new concept.",
        "Donald Trump, Republican nominee for president of the United States, got where he is by bashing immigrants. Melania Trump, potential first lady of the United States, is an immigrant herself. But what kind of immigrant is she? Trump\u2019s now a US citizen; she was naturalized in 2006 after marrying Donald. But she\u2019d been in the US for a decade before that, and her immigration history during that decade is a little murkier.",
        "History was made on Wednesday after Carla Hayden was sworn in as the first African American and woman appointed as the librarian of Congress. Hayden, 64, who was born in Tallahassee, Florida, has served as CEO of Baltimore\u2019s Pratt Library since 1993. President Barack Obama nominated her for the position in February to fill the vacancy left by James Billington, who resigned last September. As the president said in a press release, the appointment of a black person and a woman was \u201dlong overdue.\u201d Since its inception in 1800, all 13 librarians of Congress have been white men.",
        "One of the oddest features of the 2016 presidential race is that the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, emerged on the political scene this decade by repeatedly questioning whether President Barack Obama was born in America \u2014 and yet it seems Trump\u2019s embrace of this crackpot conspiracy theory has hardly been discussed during this campaign. Yes, the GOP nominee was the \u201dbirther\u201d for much of 2011, and continued to perpetuate the movement\u2019s debunked nonsense for many years afterward, despite it being fringe racist nonsense. Now, though, the Washington Post\u2019s Robert Costa has elevated the subject again.",
        "Deutsche Bank, one of the world\u2019s very largest banks, sold a lot of bad securities that ended up contributing to the 2008 Great Recession. Now, the Wall Street Journal reports that the US government is trying to hold the German bank accountable, demanding it pay $14 billion in settlements for its alleged malfeasance. That sounds like a lot of money. And it is \u2014 it\u2019s enough to create a serious problem for Deutsche Bank, which doesn\u2019t have nearly as much money on hand as the Federal Reserve thinks it should for safety against major risk ( ).",
        "Just one month ago, Hillary Clinton had amassed a lead over Donald Trump in national polls and had an even bigger advantage in several swing states. Her eventual victory seemed to many to be all but assured, and Democrats were so confident of winning that a landslide victory even seemed like a possibility. But it\u2019s all been downhill for Clinton from there. Starting in her leads in both national and swing state polls began to gradually shrink.",
        "Donald Trump promised a major statement about his embrace of conspiracy theories about President Obama\u2019s birthplace. Instead, he fooled the three major cable news networks into airing a infomercial about his hotel and his candidacy. With the \u201cbreaking news\u201d chyron on, MSNBC, Fox News, and CNN played footage of veterans praising Trump and Trump praising his own hotel. And then Trump showed up on stage for less than two minutes to say that Obama was born in the United States. This is what people mean when they complain about how \u201cthe media\u201d has covered the Trump campaign.",
        "It is now no longer the case that we need a major new catalytic event to think Donald Trump can win. Hillary Clinton hasn\u2019t just lost the massive cushion she had in late August \u2014 she\u2019s now clinging to a narrow 1. lead in the polling averages that are widely viewed as the best gauges of the race. Last week, I wrote that Trump had cut into Clinton\u2019s lead but that something dramatic would still have to change for him to really be in contention in the presidential race. Well, something did change.",
        "For 100 million years, all our ancestors reproduced basically the same way. A male reproductive organ deposited sperm into a female reproduction organ, where it could fertilize eggs \u2014 leading to baby ancestral tetrapods, mammals, primates, and eventually humans. The past 60 years have seen this begin to change, first with clinically available artificial insemination and then with in vitro fertilization (IVF). In the United States today, these two techniques lead to about 100, 000 births each year, roughly 2. 5 percent of the 4 million children born annually. Within the next few decades, that percentage will skyrocket.",
        "Ivanka Trump wants to have it both ways. She wants to rise above ugly partisan battles to call for consensus on policies that would help working women. And she wants to use her father\u2019s very divisive political campaign to advance her own ideas without damaging her standing. In the past 24 hours, she\u2019s learned how hard that can be, after an uncomfortable interview with Cosmopolitan and two easily untruths left her sounding more like her combative father than her usual polished, self.",
        "Lizz Winstead is a comedian, writer, and of The Daily Show. In 2012, she helped found Lady Parts Justice, a group that uses comedy and digital media to, in the words of its mission statement, \u201csound an alarm about the terrifying erosion of reproductive access so people will get off their asses and reclaim their rights. \u201d For the second consecutive year, Winstead and LPJ are holding an annual stage show in Washington, DC, called \u201cPostcards From the Vag. \u201d A blend of comedy and activism, the show fuses standup with intimate stories from a diverse group of performers.",
        "Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton started it \u2014 as in, the birther movement. Yes, the very movement that launched his national political career. Not stopping there, his campaign claims Trump is the one who brought it to an end. \u201dHillary Clinton\u2019s campaign first raised this issue to smear Barack Obama in her very nasty, failed 2008 campaign for President,\u201d the campaign said in a statement.",
        "Nobody would confuse the 68th annual primetime Emmy Awards, held Sunday, September 18, in Los Angeles, with the kind of excellent TV they were purportedly meant to honor. Though the show moved along at a brisk clip (and even ended on time!) too much of it felt like a rerun of earlier awards shows \u2014 from some of the more predictable winners to the fact that many of host Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s comedy bits have been done before."
