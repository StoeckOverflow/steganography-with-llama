        "Late in her speech after winning the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Made for TV Movie, Sarah Paulson gave a to Marcia Clark, the woman she played on television in FX\u2019s Emmy winning The People v. O. J. Simpson. Paulson said she had, like so many Americans, reduced Clark, the lead prosecutor in the O. J. Simpson murder trial, to a person, to someone it was easy to make the butt of a joke.",
        "The FBI announced Friday it was renewing their investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of private email servers, after deciding not to press charges in September after their first round of investigation. For months, the \u201demail scandal\u201d has haunted Clinton\u2019s campaign, and conservatives have used it to feed into a larger message: that Clinton can\u2019t be trusted. Just look at all the stories Breitbart puts under the \u201dHillary Clinton Email Scandal\u201d tag. It\u2019s a mishmash of stories \u2014 including ones about her hiding health problems, which have nothing to do with email.",
        "There\u2019s been a lot of scrutiny of the \u201d \u201d this year as the political movement has become increasingly tied to the Donald Trump campaign. Hillary Clinton gave a speech about the movement denouncing it as racist. The media has given the a lot of coverage as well, including Dylan Matthews\u2019s great explainer for Vox. But how do some of the people at the head of the movement describe themselves and their views? In a new video for liberal media watchdog Media Matters, Carlos Maza went to a press conference held by some of the \u2019s leaders.",
        "Just last month, the federal government was moving to ban a drug that you\u2019ve probably never heard of: kratom. But in an unprecedented move, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has changed its mind \u2014 the agency plans to publish a proposed rule on Thursday that will instead solicit public feedback on what to do with the drug. The move is not totally surprising. Shortly after the DEA posted its initial declaration that it will ban kratom, it admitted that it had received an unusual amount of public backlash.",
        "No one with half a brain ought to be persuaded by Donald Trump\u2019s sudden attempt to lie his way out of the idea that he was a leader of a conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama wasn\u2019t born in the US. On Friday, Trump used media interest in his birtherism stoking to produce an event at which Medal of Honor recipients praised him uncritically and that mostly wound up being an advertisement for his new hotel.",
        "The story of Edward Snowden seems for Oliver Stone. The filmmaker is American cinema\u2019s foremost critic of American imperialism, a brutal satirist, and a harsh judge of the country\u2019s government, its media, its culture, and its economy. Stone\u2019s movies tend to insist that exposing the ugly, hidden truth about the nation and its past is the most \u2014 even the only \u2014 patriotic thing a person can do.",
        "Tackling climate change is a complicated undertaking, to say the least. But here\u2019s a good rule of thumb for how to get started: Electrify everything. Replace technologies that still run on combustion, like gasoline vehicles and natural gas heating and cooling, with alternatives that run on electricity, like electric vehicles and heat pumps. Get as much of our energy consumption as possible hooked up to the power grid. The need for electrification is well understood by climate and energy experts, but I\u2019m not sure it has filtered down to the public yet; the consensus on it is fairly new.",
        "As a filmmaker, Oliver Stone is drawn to a familiar protagonist: cocksure, na\u00efve, principled, disdainful of authority. If you\u2019ve seen Wall Street, Platoon, or Born on the Fourth of July, you\u2019ll know what I mean. No surprise, then, that his latest film is a biopic of Edward Snowden, the exiled whistleblower. Starring Joseph (who\u2019s terrific) as Ed Snowden, the film is sprawling, \u2014 and borders on hagiography. According to the film, there\u2019s never a doubt as to Snowden\u2019s intentions. He\u2019s a hero, a man of conscience who stumbled into injustice and sacrificed himself for the greater good.",
        "It\u2019s nicknamed the \u201droad of death\u201d: a dusty highway lined with the wreckage of cars and the shells of blackened, deserted buildings. It\u2019s also the only way into the besieged Syrian city of Aleppo, and the latest desperate attempt at a ceasefire collapsed in part because of a fierce fight over its future. The highway is called Castello Road, named after a restaurant and resort complex that was shuttered earlier in the Syrian civil war. It stretches from Turkey to eastern Aleppo, where 250, 000 civilians are facing shortages of food, water, and medicine.",
        "Speaking tonight at a Hillary Clinton fundraiser at Danny Meyer\u2019s house in New York, President Obama gave voice to an idea that\u2019s widespread among Clinton\u2019s biggest fans but not something her campaign likes to say explicitly: The fact that she\u2019s a woman hurts her electorally. \u201cThis should not be a close election,\u201d Obama said, \u201cbut it will be, and the reason it will be is not because of Hillary\u2019s flaws but because structurally we\u2019ve become a very polarized society. \u201d But beyond polarization, Obama said that gender is a factor.",

Sign up for the Vox Sentences newsletter, delivered straight to your inbox Monday through Friday, or view the Vox Sentences archive for past editions. A weekend of nonlethal terrorism; the ceasefire in Syria is kaput; Chris Christie knew about Bridgegate. 3 attacks. Zero civilian deaths. Good work, USA.

        "On Monday afternoon, Donald Trump Jr. the son of the Republican presidential nominee, sent out an . .. interesting tweet: This image says it all. Let\u2019s end the politically correct agenda that doesn\u2019t put America first. #trump2016 pic. twitter. \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) September 19, 2016 \u201dIf I had a bowl of Skittles and I told you three would kill you, would you take a handful?\u201d implores the image. \u201dThat\u2019s our Syrian refugee problem.\u201d Let\u2019s just first clarify that analogizing refugees to nuggets of artificially flavored fruit candy is dehumanizing in every sense.",
        "The global refugee crisis is one of the top issues facing the United Nations as it meets in New York this week. Countries are under pressure to step up their commitments to accept more of the 19 million refugees and currently flung far from their homes, and alleviate one of the world\u2019s most pressing crises. The current president of the United States is chairing one of those meetings. The man who could be the next president of the United States is busy comparing refugees to poisonous snakes. His son compares them to Skittles. Donald Trump\u2019s (and Donald Trump Jr.",
        "There\u2019s a lot authorities still don\u2019t know about the bombings that shook Manhattan and New Jersey this weekend. Did the sole suspect, Ahmad Khan Rahami, have concrete ties to the Islamic State or ? Was he part of a larger terror cell? And perhaps most pressingly, could other attacks be imminent? But there are two things that forensics experts inside and outside of the government agree on: The bombs were relatively sophisticated, and if not for one key mistake, the attacks would have been much, much deadlier.",
        "Near the beginning of President Barack Obama\u2019s final speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday morning, he pointed out something really important about the world today: We are living through the best time in human history, but it feels to a lot of us like anything but. \u201cThis is the paradox that defines our world today: A quarter century after the end of the Cold War, the world is by many measures less violent and more prosperous than ever before. And yet our societies are filled with uncertainty and unease and strife,\u201d Obama said.",
        "One of the biggest stories in agriculture right now is the consolidation among companies that sell the world\u2019s seeds, pesticides, and fertilizers. Currently, there are six companies that dominate the biotech seed and agrochemical industries: Bayer, Monsanto, Dow, DuPont, Syngenta, and BASF. But in recent months, DuPont has proposed merging with Dow, Bayer has struck a deal to buy up Monsanto, and Chinese giant ChemChina is buying Syngenta. If these mergers all go through, the three biggest agribusinesses would sell 62 percent of the world\u2019s patented seeds and 62 percent of all pesticides.",
        "When anthropologists discover a new set of hominid fossils, the first questions are obvious: What is this creature? Where does it fit in on the evolutionary tree? But it has to be hard not to look into the hollow eye sockets and also wonder: Were you more like me \u2014 or more like an animal? \u201dThe desire to create a story, or to narrate and create characters, I think is really powerful\u201d for anyone doing archaeological research, Lydia Pyne, a historian, anthropologist, and author, tells me.",
        "College professors are increasingly liberal \u2014 according to a study cited in the Washington Post earlier this year, the percentage of American professors identifying as \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201cfar left\u201d jumped from 42 percent in 1990 to 60 percent in 2014. Glenn Loury is an outlier in this environment \u2014 his politics are difficult to pin down exactly, but they\u2019re probably best described as right of center.",
        "Spiro P. \u2019s Yelp review of the Louvre, posted in 2010, seems like artistic blasphemy. But in some ways, the disappointment is familiar to anybody who\u2019s been there: The curator of the Louvre should take down all the \u201dMona Lisa\u201d signs and promote other works. The \u201dMona Lisa\u201d is a painting of status and nothing more. So Spiro P. didn\u2019t like it. Is there at least a cynic\u2019s case for the \u201dMona Lisa\u2019s\u201d fame? Why did she become the most famous painting in the world while other pieces fail to excite the world\u2019s coffee mug makers?",
        "A new TV season brings with it a revival of that question: How do you know when it\u2019s time to give up on a show? Fortunately for you, dear reader, I \u2014 a professional television critic \u2014 have rules about these things, and these rules may also be useful to you. They\u2019ve certainly been useful to me. The trick is to be ruthless, but not too ruthless. It\u2019s important to remember that comedy usually takes longer to gel than drama.",
        "Political analysts are obsessed with white people, the more disaffected the better. \u201dWill there be enough white voters to elect Donald Trump?\u201d \u201dThere are more white voters than people think.\u201d \u201dWhy Obama must reach out to angry whites.\u201d \u201dCan the Democrats win back white voters?\u201d \u201dHas Clinton written off white men?\u201d This obsession has both fed upon and stimulated a substantial body of reporting and commentary on economic, social, and cultural change in white America \u2014 some of it richly revealing, some bordering on caricature.",
        "Women \u2014 on planes, on trains, in automobiles, or on the street \u2014 don\u2019t owe anyone anything. But due to an unfortunate sense of entitlement that\u2019s rampant in our society (see the recent viral story \u201dHow to Talk to a Woman Wearing Headphones,\u201d which rightly caused outrage all over the internet) this sentiment must be repeated every so often. On Friday, actress Sophia Bush dispatched her own iteration of this message.",
        "The biggest and most surprising celebrity divorce of our time is upon us: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are, according to TMZ, getting divorced. The shock you might feel is understandable. They\u2019re two movie stars who have become pop culture\u2019s shorthand for true love. They have supported each other through moments that are terrifyingly real. They have six children. There\u2019s no doubt this is a big and unique story that speaks to the way we consume celebrity culture and translate it into our own lives.",
        "It is 1968. Year of blood. Year of protest. Year of insurgency. Year of a pivotal election: Republican Richard Nixon versus Democrat Hubert Humphrey. I decide that Nixon and Humphrey are indistinguishable, and I refuse to vote. I encourage others to do the same. It\u2019s a mistake I regret to this day. At first, students on the left were full of hope about the 1968 election I am a New England regional organizer for Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) the largest New Left student organization spearheading the opposition to the war in Vietnam.",
        "The millions of people who\u2019ve fled Syria have risked their lives to escape ISIS. The most memorable image of them was a boy who was photographed after his death, drowned on a beach in Turkey, which rocketed around social media just a year ago. Donald Trump Jr. the son of Donald Trump and one of the Republican candidate\u2019s closest advisers, used a very different image to refer to these people: a bowl of Skittles. \u201cIf I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you.",
        "Particle physicists are rather philosophical when describing their work. \u201cWhatever we find out, that is what nature chose,\u201d Kyle Cranmer, a physics professor at New York University, tells me. It\u2019s a good attitude to have when your field yields great disappointments. For months, evidence was mounting that the Large Hadron Collider, the biggest and most powerful particle accelerator in the world, had found something extraordinary: a new subatomic particle, which would be a discovery surpassing even the LHC\u2019s discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, and perhaps the most significant advance since Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity.",
        "Theoretically, NBC\u2019s This Is Us, which debuted Tuesday night, should be one of my favorite shows of the fall. Rating 3 It\u2019s pretty cheesy, but I love cheese. Its drama is relatively but I love that, too. And above all else, its gentle family stories are the perfect palate cleanser for a TV landscape too addicted to pointless bombast. And yet something about This Is Us gives me pause. Maybe it\u2019s too earnest? Maybe it\u2019s a little too enamored of all of the things I described above? Or maybe it\u2019s just too pleased with its own cleverness.",
        "Early on Wednesday, TMZ broke the news that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are divorcing. The response was immediate, and by and large followed the same template: This is not just the end of a marriage but the end of Brangelina. \u201cThey are a portmanteau no more,\u201d wrote Vulture. \u201cBrangelina reduced to component parts,\u201d wrote the A. V. Club. \u201cBrangelina no more,\u201d wrote CBC Canada. Brangelina was a distinctive celebrity entity, one that for most of its life outshone its component parts. And now it\u2019s dead.",
        "Here\u2019s a question tormenting Democratic officials and liberal pundits as the country hurtles toward Election Day: When did young voters stop liking them? It was bad enough for them that millennials backed Bernie Sanders in unprecedented numbers over party favorite Hillary Clinton during the presidential primary. But now the kids are flirting with presidential candidates instead of getting behind Clinton, with a series of new polls showing upward of 40 percent of young voters planning to back Libertarian Gary Johnson or Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Both the press and Clinton\u2019s campaign have started to pay attention.",
        "A Russian newspaper is reporting that Vladimir Putin plans to unite his domestic security, foreign espionage, and counterintelligence agencies into one superagency, in effect recreating the old Soviet KGB. If true, it suggests Putin is seriously worried about his future \u2014 and that he dramatically misunderstands the risks in this maneuver. The circumstantial evidence that this or a similar measure is in the works has been steadily growing. The Federal Security Service (FSB) the agency likely to dominate this new body, has been acting with unusual confidence, even arresting senior figures from other services."
