        "The Charlotte, North Carolina, police officer who shot and killed Keith Lamont Scott \u2014 a shooting that led to protests and riots in September \u2014 will not face criminal charges, the local prosecutor announced on Wednesday. According to police, officers were looking for a wanted suspect with an outstanding warrant in Charlotte, the Washington Post reported. They reportedly saw Scott \u2014 who wasn\u2019t the wanted suspect \u2014 rolling a marijuana blunt, then holding a gun.",

        "Countless studies, statistics, investigations, and anecdotes tell us that a person\u2019s race can determine the kinds of interactions he or she will have with the police \u2014 and how likely it is that he or she will survive the encounter. At this point, this reality is largely beyond debate. Yet the topic of unarmed black people being killed by law enforcement officers at wildly disproportionate rates is often dubbed \u201ccontroversial,\u201d and is framed as an issue about which reasonable people can disagree. It\u2019s not.",
        "There were two police shootings in the past week \u2014 and police\u2019s responses to them could not have been more different. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, a police officer shot and killed Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man. Shortly after the shooting, police released all available video that they had \u2014 promising to get to the bottom of what happened in an investigation. In Charlotte, North Carolina, a police officer shot and killed Keith Lamont Scott, a black man police claim was armed and brandishing a gun.",
        "Samuel Goldman is one of America\u2019s most thoughtful conservatives. A professor of political theory at George Washington University and the executive director of its Loeb Institute for Religious Freedom, he spends his days pondering the ideas that define American politics. Recently, Goldman has come to an uncomfortable conclusion: The conservative movement has failed. Its traditional package of ideas \u2014 free market economics, social conservatism, and an interventionist foreign policy \u2014 has long dominated the Republican Party but has clearly failed to win over enough actual voters to secure the White House.",
        "When looking at the images of protests and violence in Charlotte, North Carolina, over the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, Americans should consider one possibility: It could happen in your town. It\u2019s clear from the protests that have escalated into violence this week that Charlotte was a powder keg, the killing of Scott just a spark. It\u2019s tempting to ask: Why Charlotte? Why now? Charlotte does have some unique issues \u2014 the Charlotte area ranked last in an analysis of 50 metropolitan areas for social mobility, and the segregation of Charlotte\u2019s schools remains a very big local issue.",

Related Every new TV show of fall 2016, ranked This fall is a solid one for new shows, but it\u2019s also positively stuffed with great returning series.

        "The images the League considers symbols of hate are often historically fraught: the swastika, the Confederate flag, the Ku Klux Klan\u2019s burning cross. Now they have company from a green cartoon frog. The ADL, a Jewish group that fights and other forms of hate, just added Pepe the Frog to its database of hate symbols. Pepe the Frog has been around the internet for years. Just a year ago he was so innocuous that celebrities like Katy Perry could tweet him without fear of backlash.",
        "One of Donald Trump\u2019s latest proposals is to revive and expand the practice of stop and frisk, a ineffective, and unconstitutional New York City policy that once allowed officers to search any person they suspected of a minor crime \u2014 and was used disproportionately against black and Latino men. Trump\u2019s statement on this topic was made public Wednesday in a tweet from NBC politics reporter Alexandra Jaffe, who was reporting from the taping of an \u201c town hall\u201d event.

        "Hillary Clinton wants to become the president of the United States of America, and there is nothing she won\u2019t do to make that a reality. This now includes an interview with Zach Galifianakis, braving a few insults about her pantsuits and her campaign on his fake web talk show Between Two Ferns. Like most Between Two Ferns interviews (see: President Barack Obama and Justin Bieber) its brilliance is in its awkwardness and Galifianakis\u2019s ability to create this persona and ask absurd questions.",

Recognized by the MacArthur Foundation as \u201ca critical voice in current conversations about racial violence,\u201d Rankine\u2019s work borders on prophecy, particularly her lauded collection of lyrical essays Citizen and its searing commentary on police brutality, featured in two pages of the book.

        "If you don\u2019t want Donald Trump to become president, you\u2019ve probably fantasized about a debate moderator interrupting him and calling him out: \u201dHere are the things you\u2019ve said so far that aren\u2019t true. ..\u201d But on the eve of the first debate, the head of the Commission on Presidential Debates, Janet Brown, crushed those daydreams into finely ground dust. \u201dI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica,\u201d she told CNN. In her view, it\u2019s the candidates\u2019 job to each other \u2014 not the moderator\u2019s job to fact check them.",
        "The past month for Donald Trump Jr. has been an endless roiling controversy that most Republican presidential nominees would have done anything to shut down.

        "Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin has a great new interview with President Obama in Vanity Fair. In the interview, they discuss Abraham Lincoln, Obama\u2019s biggest regrets from his time in office, and how a visit to the pyramids reminded Obama that cable news doesn\u2019t really matter. But perhaps the most intriguing bit was when, in a brief discussion of Obama\u2019s plans for his Obama hinted that he planned to start speaking out more like an activist than a president. There are \u201cthings,\u201d he told Goodwin, \u201cthat in some ways I suspect I\u2019m able to do better out of this office.",

        "Henry David Thoreau has a likability problem. With dismaying regularity, my students find him to be a scold, a killjoy, and a hypocrite. Those who appreciate what he has to offer are few and far between, most aligning themselves instead with the position Kathryn Schulz elaborates in her scathing takedown of Thoreau, \u201cPond Scum,\u201d an essay I\u2019ve taken to assigning alongside Walden ever since it ran in the New Yorker last October. It gets them talking. I cannot deny that the Thoreau of Walden is a curmudgeon.",
        "A House Judiciary Committee hearing on abortion Friday morning took a bizarre turn when, while discussing women of color who have abortions, Republican Congress members brought up the subjects of slavery, black genocide, and a litter of puppies. And the response from Kierra Johnson, executive director of URGE (Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity) a black woman and the panel\u2019s only witness, made clear how offensive many women of color might find those remarks to be. Rep.",
        "Moments before a Charlotte, North Carolina, police officer shot and killed Keith Lamont Scott, his wife was on the scene recording the events as they unfolded. The video, published by the New York Times, offers no new significant evidence. It\u2019s too far away from the scene to make out what Scott and police officers are doing, and the shooting happens out of frame. It also doesn\u2019t answer the crucial question of whether Scott had a gun and brandished it against police, as officers claim.",
        "With manslaughter charges filed against the Tulsa, Oklahoma, police officer who shot and killed Terence Crutcher, there is now a clear, recurring theme in police shooting cases: Video \u2014 whether from a body, cellphone, or dashboard camera \u2014 truly works for holding police accountable. Now, video doesn\u2019t always work perfectly. There are still issues with how the public can access video maintained by the police \u2014 like in North Carolina, where police shot and killed Keith Lamont Scott, but have so far refused to release video of the shooting.",
        "Donald Trump says he\u2019ll listen to the nation\u2019s generals about how to fight ISIS. He won\u2019t like what they have to say. Earlier this month, Trump said that one of his first acts as president would be to give his generals \u201c30 days to submit a plan for soundly and quickly defeating ISIS. \u201d He seems to think the reason ISIS stands is that the Obama administration has been too weak and feckless to give the military what it wants: the resources and freedom to crush our enemies. He\u2019s wrong. But the way in which he\u2019s wrong is telling.",
        "The presidential race is very close both nationally and in swing states, and though Hillary Clinton appears to have a narrow edge, she doesn\u2019t have much room for error, according to the latest polling averages. The good news for Clinton is that her recent decline in the polls seems to have halted, for now at least. She apparently has a low national lead over Donald Trump, and still holds consistent poll leads in enough \u2014 just enough \u2014 states to give her the presidency.",
        "This Tuesday, Donald Trump met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah . Thursday night, he called in to Lou Dobbs\u2019s show on Fox Business to report on how the meeting went. What he said was embarrassingly ignorant. Trump seemed to praise Sisi\u2019s seizure of power in a military coup, then described Sisi\u2019s counterterrorism campaign as a success when it\u2019s actually a crushing human rights failure. Perhaps more fundamentally, though, Trump\u2019s comments are deeply revealing about his worldview.",
        "Donald Trump wasted no time using the recent bombing in New York City to rev up his harsh rhetoric against immigrants of Middle Eastern descent. \u201dThis is only going to get worse,\u201d he told Fox News. \u201dYou have to stop them from coming into the country.\u201d Never mind that the accused bomber was a naturalized US citizen who had arrived in the US as a young boy, 22 years ago.",
        "So you want an electric car. You\u2019re not alone \u2014 surveys show that consumer interest in EVs is steadily rising. People are slowly becoming convinced that EVs are real, not some distant . But consumers are also confused. There\u2019s a lot of hype and misinformation floating around about EVs. I thought it would be helpful to share this simple chart, from the folks over at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. It shows the battery electric vehicles, or BEVs (not hybrids or hybrids) currently available and coming soon, how much they cost, and how far they can go on a charge.",
        "On Wednesday, March 30, 2016, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit did something extraordinary: It asked viewers to empathize with an admitted rapist. SVU, which returned for its 18th season on Wednesday, is not a subtle show. For those who haven\u2019t watched, it\u2019s a pulpy cop procedural with a penchant for almost implausible plot twists. Its focus on sex crimes can be both empowering (it puts a huge emphasis on believing women) and frustrating in its sensationalistic focus on the grisliest details of sexual violence (as in an arc involving a serial killer who menaces the unit\u2019s lead detective).",

That\u2019s the conclusion of an analysis of CDC data from LCB, which broke down the types of animals most uniquely likely to kill you in your state \u2014 with larger mammals, mostly deer, coming out on top in most states: Still, death by animal remains pretty rare in America: The odds of an animal killing you are one in nearly 1. 4 million. Within those odds, however, deer are more likely to cause deaths than other animals \u2014 more than dogs, bears, sharks, and alligators combined, according to the LCB analysis.",
        "This year marks the 25th anniversary of the most seminal grunge album of our time. On September 24, 1991, Seattle rock band Nirvana released their second album, Nevermind. A to the band\u2019s relatively successful debut Bleach, Nevermind became a surprise chart topper late in the year thanks to the incredibly popular single \u201cSmells Like Teen Spirit,\u201d which dominated the radio and MTV in the early \u201990s. Both Nirvana and frontman Kurt Cobain became household names, and the rest, as they say, is history."
