        "Memes and trending topics come and go, but one truth remains eternal: If you want to start an argument on Twitter, declare that an art form is dead. In the old days, people routinely declared the death of the novel, but these days it\u2019s the movies that are always dying in one way or another. (One can only imagine some prehistoric critic scratching out declarations of the death of cave paintings.) But why be satisfied with merely proclaiming the Death of Cinema if you can also assign blame to TV?",
        "Good morning! It\u2019s Saturday, and that means it\u2019s time for your weekly book link roundup. Herewith is the best the internet has to offer on books and related subjects for the week of September 19, 2016. Prolific thriller author James Patterson apparently wrote a book called The Murder of Stephen King, and it has finally occurred to him that it\u2019s a little weird to publish a book about the death of your professional rival.",
        "The roughly 55, 000 residents of Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin \u2014 the first to cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump this year, starting September 19 \u2014 will be joined by voters in Minnesota, Wyoming, Vermont, and South Dakota by September 23, as early voting periods start across the country.",
        "\u201dWait, how did you sum up that show in one sentence again?\u201d my sister asked, squinting at the TV screen. I, being a professional watcher of television and all, had The Good Place\u2019s logline ready: \u201dKristen Bell accidentally ends up in heaven and has to pretend like she\u2019s a good person to avoid hell.\u201d This answer satisfied my sister in the moment, but really, describing the plot of NBC\u2019s new comedy \u2014 which premiered two episodes on September 19 before moving to its regular time slot on Thursday, September 22 \u2014 raises more questions than it answers.",
        "The media is starting to agree: Donald Trump lies. The question has instead become what to do about it during the debates. When Trump repeated an old lie about how he opposed the Iraq War from the start of NBC\u2019s Forum, claimed America is one the \u201d \u201d nations in the world (it\u2019s one of the least taxed) and said Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment (she hasn\u2019t said that) Clinton\u2019s campaign, along with many established voices in media and politics, called for live during the debates to counter him. Not so fast, others argue.",
        "The conventional wisdom about Donald Trump is that on the debate stage and off, he\u2019s unpredictable \u2014 so unpredictable that Martin O\u2019Malley, who challenged Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, told the Atlantic\u2019s James Fallows that Trump is like \u201ca monkey with a machine gun. \u201d But the truth is that Trump\u2019s 11 primary debates predicted his performance in the first presidential debate on September 26. In every debate appearance so far, he\u2019s used a handful of tricks that, when they worked, did so because they aren\u2019t the way politicians usually act.",
        "I spent the weekend trying to figure out how to start this piece \u2014 how to ground my sense that this presidential debate is beginning in a bad place \u2014 and then MSNBC put up this graphic: This seems on the level. pic. twitter. \u2014 Matthew Yglesias (@mattyglesias) September 26, 2016 This is the Donald Trump curve. Hillary Clinton needs to answer every question perfectly and make people laugh while she does it. Trump needs to stop lying and bragging so much. It defies parody. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong. MSNBC is simply echoing the conventional wisdom.",
        "It takes a certain kind of stubbornness to lie about things that are easy to verify. Donald Trump does it all the time. During the first presidential debate, he interrupted Hillary Clinton to deny that he had once called climate change a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. During the second presidential debate, he interrupted her to deny telling America to \u201dcheck out (the) sex tape\u201d of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. During the third, the interruption was to deny he\u2019d mocked a reporter with a disability. He had.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s pitch for his tax plan is simple: families will pay less. The Trump campaign site, for instance, promises that his plan will cut taxes for a married couple with two kids, $50, 000 in earnings, and $8, 000 in child care expenses by a whopping 35 percent. Not bad, huh? Even though the plan concentrates benefits among the rich, it\u2019s hard for a family to get annoyed at their tax bill falling by over a third. The only problem: This is a lie.",
        "After reaching the lowest rate in decades in 2014, America\u2019s murder rate in 2015 went up by a little more than 11 percent. The increase, reported in the FBI\u2019s latest version of its Uniform Crime Reports, is quite large. It also seemed to hit every part of the country \u2014 the rate went up in big to small cities, nonmetropolitan counties, suburban areas, and every major region in the US. Still, the increase leaves the murder rate below the levels of 2009 and half of where it was in 1991.",
        "There is this new ad from the health insurer Cigna that suddenly I\u2019m seeing everywhere. It features America\u2019s favorite TV doctors \u2014 from ER\u2019s Noah Wylie to Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019s Patrick Dempsey \u2014 urging Americans to get their annual physicals. \u201cWe are the TV doctors of America,\u201d Wylie announces. \u201cAnd we\u2019re here to save lives. \u201d The actors in the video have taken to Twitter to spread the word even further. Just another day on set? Nah. Now we\u2019re helping @Cigna save lives for real. Check it out and #GoKnowControl #Ad pic. twitter.",
        "Part one of this series on Israeli settlers explains the background of the movement. In this next video, I go inside the settlements and talk to the people about why they decided to move onto some of the most disputed land on Earth. Early Israeli settlers were a group of activists who set out to settle the West Bank, at first without any permission or support from their government. They trekked into hostile territory to plant the flag of Israel, risking their lives for a deep ideological conviction that the land was theirs.",
        "Suppose a pilot study on a new program found that 80 percent of the subjects had quit successfully, most of them without much struggle. In a sane world \u2014 considering that some 400, 000 Americans die each year from diseases \u2014 a dozen labs would have moved quickly, with federal funding, to test that finding, and further success would have generated a quick move toward trials.",
        "Over the weekend, Bashar \u2019s regime and its Russian allies launched a ferocious assault on territory in the eastern part of Aleppo City. The bombing campaign was stunning even for a place that has long been a central front in Syria\u2019s civil war. \u201cThere are dead people in the streets, and fires are burning without control,\u201d Ammar the head of the local White Helmets civil defense organization, told the Washington Post\u2019s Liz Sly. \u201cPeople don\u2019t know what to do or where to go. There is no escape. It is like the end of the world.",
        "Transparent\u2019s third season is the Amazon dramedy\u2019s messiest yet, but that\u2019s at least partially by design. Rating 4. 5 In a move that\u2019s fascinating for a family show, season three is largely about the characters attempting to find surrogate families to replace the one they were born into. They fail, of course. You can pick your friends, etc. But goodness knows they try. As such, season three is much more episodic than either of the first two seasons.",
        "Ninety percent of every human interaction on this earth is boring. Some people are funnier than others; some have more important things to say. But the vast majority of conversations consist of the kind of small talk that keeps people vaguely informed entertained without revealing much at all. This was the main thought that kept running through my brain while watching Easy, Netflix\u2019s anthology series about the interlocking love lives of Chicagoans. Creator Joe Swanberg is known for his \u201c \u201d style, meaning that he gives his actors outlines rather than fully formed scripts.",
        "To taste your favorite cereal is to transport yourself back to the saccharin days of youth \u2014 the Saturday cartoons, the lazy mornings, the innocent bliss. Since we tend to romanticize the cereals we grew up with, debating which one is the best can be a rather contentious affair. Luckily, there\u2019s some data out there on this that may settle things a bit. Since 2009, MrBreakfast. com has maintained a database called the Cereal Project.",
        "Donald Trump wants America to know that he\u2019s smart. When pressed, he\u2019ll cop to being greedy and even a bit dishonest in his past dealings. He\u2019ll admit he\u2019s said inflammatory things over the course of his campaign and even kinda sorta maybe apologize for some of them. But he\u2019s a smart guy. A rich guy. A savvy operator who wants America \u2014 or at least a certain slice of America \u2014 to believe he\u2019s now going to be on their side.",
        "Elon Musk has a vision. Within the next decade, humans will blast off from Earth, begin colonizing Mars, and eventually become a \u201dmultiplanetary species.\u201d It will take a lot of money, a lot more luck, and a really, really, ridiculously large spaceship. On Tuesday, Musk made his most impassioned and detailed case for space colonization yet at an event with SpaceX, his private spaceflight company. \u201dSomeday soon, there will be an extinction event on Earth,\u201d Musk said. So we can either sit around and wait for that to hit.",
        "After months of verbal sparring and racist demagoguery and fretting over email server management and telling each other to delete their accounts, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump finally met at Long Island\u2019s Hofstra University for the first of three debates. The political science suggests that the night\u2019s proceedings will have a small, but potentially decisive, effect on the election, and that much of how voters interpret debates is determined by the hot takes they hear from TV news commentators in the immediate aftermath.",
        "Try to imagine yourself as a Rip Van Winkle awakening after a few years of hibernation. You weren\u2019t following the election news, but you knew it was a big story, and so you tuned in to tonight\u2019s first presidential debate to see what the hubbub was all about. You\u2019d be confused. You\u2019d quickly see that Hillary Clinton represents a familiar archetype. She\u2019s been in American politics for a long time. She served as the nation\u2019s top diplomat and as a United States senator. She sponsored bills and was part of diplomatic agreements.",
        "Hillary Clinton broke Donald Trump within the first 20 minutes of Monday night\u2019s presidential debate. I spent the rest of it wondering how big the cracks had to get for America to notice. Trump started with a calm pace and deliberately measured tone: a studiously presidential style. (Even the orange of his fake tan was toned down by layers of TV makeup.) It didn\u2019t last. The first couple of times that Clinton referred to Trump as \u201cDonald\u201d instead of \u201cMr.",
        "Donald Trump started his business with a tiny loan, Hillary Clinton has been fighting ISIS since 1947, and stop and frisk doesn\u2019t disproportionately affect people of color. These are some of the fabrications you would have heard from Trump during Monday night\u2019s presidential debate. Trump has amassed a record of stating falsehoods throughout the campaign \u2014 a record that has been widely picked up on and derided by longtime political observers. \u201cAll politicians bend the truth to fit their purposes, including Hillary Clinton,\u201d wrote the New York Times in an unusual critical news story last week. \u201cBut Donald J.",
        "Donald Trump is great at doing the seemingly unimaginable. He won the Republican nomination over 15 other potential nominees who looked better on paper, with a thin ground game, little cash on hand, and not much buoying him in the early going beyond his celebrity. On that level, maybe he\u2019s a political savant? But when he\u2019s asked to do something that\u2019s fairly standard campaign ritual \u2014 host a political convention, say, or compete in a debate \u2014 he very rarely pulls it off.",
        "If you\u2019re at all interested in climate policy, you really ought to be following the huge court case over the Clean Power Plan in the DC Circuit Court. Oral arguments begin Tuesday morning. The central plank of President Obama\u2019s climate agenda is facing a serious legal challenge, and this case will decide whether the plan survives \u2014 with potentially large repercussions around the globe. The Supreme Court is likely to weigh in later on, and we may not get a final resolution for a year or two.",
        "I think we have an ideology about talent that says that talent is a tangible, resilient, hardened, shiny thing. It will always rise to the top. To find and encourage talent, all you have to do as a society is to make sure the right doors are open. Free campus visits, free tuition, letters to the kids with high scores. \u2026 You raise your hand and say, \u201cOver here!\u201d And the talent will come running, but that\u2019s not true \u2026 [i]t\u2019s not resilient and shiny \u2026 [t]alent is really, really fragile.",
        "In the Comedy Central series Drunk History, a drunk comedian \u2014 gently guided by series and drinking buddy Derek Waters \u2014 tells a historical story, which in turn gets acted out with characters every one of the narrator\u2019s sloshed words. The whole thing started out in 2007 as a YouTube sketch, with Mark Gagliardi telling the story of Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr\u2019s deadly duel after he had downed a bottle of Scotch. nine years, and Waters is shepherding an show that\u2019s about to premiere its fourth season of storytelling.",
        "The first presidential debate featured a man who didn\u2019t know what he was talking about repeatedly shouting over a woman who was extraordinarily prepared. The debate was a collision between Donald Trump\u2019s politics of dominance and Hillary Clinton\u2019s politics of preparation. Clinton\u2019s politics of preparation won. Trump did his best to be fair. He interrupted Clinton 25 times in the debate\u2019s first 26 minutes. He talked over both her and moderator Lester Holt with ease. But the show of dominance quickly ran into a problem: Trump would shout over his interlocutors only to prove he had nothing to say.",
        "At Monday night\u2019s presidential debate, by our count, Donald Trump interrupted Hillary Clinton 25 times in the first 26 minutes of the debate. By the time the debate was over, Trump had interrupted Clinton 51 times \u2014 whereas Clinton had interrupted Trump just 17 times. Counting the interruptions of both candidates by moderator Lester Holt, Clinton was interrupted a total of 70 times, and Trump was interrupted 47 times.",
        "In the conversation around the 2016 presidential election, the major negative narratives about Donald Trump have tended to focus on his racism, his temperament, or his tendency to tell lies. Yet there\u2019s another important Trump trait that\u2019s gotten some attention but really needs to get much more \u2014 he\u2019s corrupt, and in a consistent way. Whenever Trump has been in positions of power or authority, he has demonstrated a pattern of trying to enrich himself by abusing the trust others have placed in him \u2014 whether it\u2019s creditors, contractors, charitable givers, Trump University students, regulators, or campaign donors."
