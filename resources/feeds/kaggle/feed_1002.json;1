        "Most of the time, Hillary Clinton attacks Donald Trump for his incoherence over policy, saying he doesn\u2019t have an actual plan to defeat ISIS, the economy, or defend national security. But there\u2019s at least one issue on which Clinton likes to stress that Trump does in fact have a set policy: tax cuts for the super wealthy. She tried pressing the issue again during Monday night\u2019s presidential debate: The kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be economics . ..",
        "A shooting suspect is in custody after a reported shooting at Townville Elementary School in Anderson County, South Carolina, multiple local news outlets reported. Here\u2019s what we know: At around 1:45 pm, Anderson County deputies were called to the school for a possible shooting. The shooting is believed to be over. A teenage suspect is currently in custody, local officials said. At least two children and one teacher were injured. Their injuries don\u2019t appear to be WYFF 4 reported. There was a gun homicide near the school.",
        "If there were any doubt as to just how toxic sectarian politics has become in the Middle East, the latest statement from the leader of the Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah should clear things right up. Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary general of a group that has been fighting Israel for decades, declared on Tuesday that \u201cWahhabism is more evil than Israel,\u201d Lebanon\u2019s Al Akhbar newspaper reported. Wahhabism is the strain of Sunni Islam that Saudi Arabia\u2019s government promotes and that strongly influences the ideology of Sunni jihadist groups like and ISIS.",
        "Teen births hit a new low in 2015 \u2014 and have fallen by nearly half over the past seven years. New federal data shows there were 22. 3 births for every 1, 000 girls ages 15 to 19. That\u2019s a 47 percent decline from the teen birthrate in 2009 \u2014 and a 64 percent decline from the teen birthrate in 1991. The reduction in teen births is arguably one of the biggest public health victories of the 21st century. It\u2019s rare to see such significant changes in a health metric in just a few years.",
        "Donald Trump got his start in politics peddling the idea that Barack Obama was born abroad. He built his successful Republican primary campaign on a similar form of white identity politics, married to a deep and skepticism of immigration. That\u2019s been his biggest single issue \u2014 deriding Mexicans as rapists and murderers, promising to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, and threatening to ban Muslims from entering the country. At Monday night\u2019s debate, he had the perfect opportunity to tee off on these racially charged themes.",
        "Moderator Lester Holt called out Donald Trump on the Iraq War in what became one of the first debate\u2019s most devastating moments for Trump. Tens of millions of Americans watched Trump squirm as he tried to explain how he was against the war, when he\u2019d publicly said he was for it. So naturally, Fox News decided to do damage control after the debate, publishing an article that claimed \u201chistory backs The Donald\u201d on opposing the Iraq War.",
        "During the presidential debate on Monday, Donald Trump claimed that the end of New York City\u2019s policy led to a rise in murders, and Hillary Clinton claimed that a judge declared the policy unconstitutional. The New York City Police Department apparently took issue with both of these claims: Even the NYPD was the debate: pic. twitter. \u2014 Jenna McLaughlin (@JennaMC_Laugh) September 28, 2016 Some of the NYPD\u2019s claims here are questionable. US District Court Judge Shira Scheindlin really did find in 2013 that stop and frisk, as the NYPD enforced it, was unconstitutional.",
        "Donald Trump is personally ignorant on every public policy issue I can think of. Every president, however, comes into office with some blind spots and ends up relying on a wider team of aides and advisers. That\u2019s what makes the wonky white paper on Trump\u2019s economic policy his campaign released on Monday particularly shocking. This is the brain trust that is supposed to backstop Trump\u2019s lack of personal knowledge, and their work is, frankly, shoddy. The authors are Wilbur Ross, a rich private equity investor, and Peter Navarro, an eccentric but economics professor at UC Irvine.",
        "In this wild presidential year, it can feel like nothing is happening but Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. But on Wednesday, Congress somehow managed to get itself back into the spotlight. Both the House and Senate approved a series of measures before clocking out for recess \u2014 legislation that will keep the government open, bring federal aid to Flint, Michigan, provide flood relief to thousands in Louisiana, and return a man to his rightful ancestors. It\u2019s a lot to make sense of.",
        "Maybe \u2014 despite copious evidence to the contrary \u2014 Donald Trump might, as he once promised to do, plug the considerable holes in his knowledge of public policy and world affairs by \u201chiring the best people. \u201d But it sure looks like he wouldn\u2019t listen to them. Before the first presidential debate \u2014 according to reports that have trickled out in the past few days \u2014 some of Trump\u2019s advisers apparently urged him to hold some traditional debate preparation sessions, instead of just watching cable news and listening to Roger Ailes tell war stories. He refused.",
        "When Manu Prakash was growing up in India, he was obsessed with skeletons. Upon finding a dead rabbit, he would clean and painstakingly reassemble its bones. \u201dIt physically told me how intricate every object actually is,\u201d Prakash tells me. \u201dThe more you see, the more you want to see.\u201d The bioengineering professor at Stanford, best known for the Foldscope, a paper microscope that costs less than $1, was recently awarded the MacArthur Foundation\u2019s Genius Grant of $625, 000.",
        "Back in September, I spoke with Mark Lilla, a political theorist and historian of ideas at Columbia University. He had just published a book titled The Shipwrecked Mind, a short meditation on the rise of political reactionaries. Of all the conversations I\u2019ve had about this election, the one with Lilla now stands out. To the surprise of many, myself included, Donald Trump was elected president of the United States last night, and we have to reckon with that fact. Trump\u2019s appeal isn\u2019t reducible to any one thing.",
        "Donald Trump says he opposed the Iraq War from the beginning. Legions of have found no evidence for this claim. Now Trump says he opposed the war in a secret phone call to Sean Hannity. There is, of course, no way to verify this; only Hannity knows for sure. Zack Beauchamp runs down all the latest claims and here. What gets somewhat lost in the media coverage of this back and forth is that there is no answer to the question of whether Trump opposed the war in 2003.",
        "There is ample evidence of gender bias in the American workforce. R\u00e9sum\u00e9s submitted with female names, for example, are judged to be less competent than those with male names. This is true when either men or women evaluate the given r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u2014 all of us seem to think less of experience when it\u2019s associated with a female name. John Greathouse, a venture capitalist who teaches at the University of California Santa Barbara, surveyed all this research. And he recently wrote in the Wall Street Journal about his solution: To avoid gender bias, women ought to hide their gender.",
        "Nobody ever tells you about the sleep deprivation. At around 4:30 am, while the rest of the world is still asleep, I wake up and get moving under cover of darkness. Quiet spots with some degree of tree cover, or the occasional hospital or church parking lot, are typically where I sleep for the night. Still, there\u2019s always the risk that someone will spot me and I\u2019ll wake up with police blaring a flashlight into my eyes. Every night and every morning, I wonder how it got to be like this.",
        "Two years ago, global oil prices plummeted as the world started pumping out far more crude than anyone needed. That price crash, from $100 barrel down to $40 per barrel, completely upended the global economy \u2014 and cost oil producers like Saudi Arabia billions of dollars in lost revenue. Now those oil producers have had enough. On Wednesday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) announced an agreement to cut back on output in an attempt to lift global prices back up.",
        "Michiko Kakutani, the New York Times\u2019s chief book critic, has a very interesting review out this week of volume one of Volker Ullrich\u2019s new biography of Adolf Hitler. After a few hundred words of introduction, she rather abruptly shifts format away from a traditional book review toward simply a summary of a few key themes and plot points from Ullrich\u2019s narrative. And while she does not explicitly say so, it is impossible to avoid reading it as a deliberate, thinly veiled commentary on Donald Trump.",
        "Tim Burton\u2019s latest movie, Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children, is in theaters this weekend. Among its curiosities: a pair of rapping Welsh teenagers, a suspiciously Slender Man \u2014 like apparition, skeletons, Frankensteined puppet fighting, and World War II bombers. Also a kid who can project movies out of his head. Suffice it to say: I have questions. Rating 2. 5 Was this material written with Tim Burton in mind? I don\u2019t think Ransom Riggs wrote his debut novel, Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children, with Tim Burton in mind.",
        "Tennis superstar Serena Williams has a message in the wake of the latest string of police shootings of African Americans: \u201cI won\u2019t be silent. \u201d On Tuesday, Williams recounted on Facebook how a simple day with her nephew as he drove her around for meetings was disrupted when they spotted a police officer on the road, reminding her of the persistent reality that her nephew could be another victim: Today I asked my 18 year old nephew (to be clear he\u2019s black) to drive me to my meetings so I can work on my phone #safetyfirst.",
        "Former Israeli President and Prime Minister Shimon Peres spent the first half of his life building up Israel\u2019s military might and the second half trying to forge peace deals with its neighbors. He had a lot more success with the former than with the latter \u2014 and his death is a sad reminder that the prospects for peace are more remote now than ever before. Peres, who died Tuesday at age 93, was the last of the generation of men and women who founded Israel in the aftermath of the Holocaust.",
        "Donald Trump is an unusual candidate who does a lot of unusual things. For example, after flubbing a debate performance in which he appeared volatile, irritable, and uninformed about key issues, he did not attempt to refocus his campaign on proven message points or topics where he has a firm grasp of talking points. Instead, he\u2019s been lashing out at Alicia Machado while using apophasis to bring up Bill Clinton\u2019s marital infidelity by saying he\u2019s not talking about Bill Clinton\u2019s marital infidelity. It seems like a bad strategy because it almost certainly is in fact a bad strategy.",
        "On August 25, Jennifer Tackett, a psychology professor at Northwestern University, got an odd email in her inbox. It was from PubPeer, an online forum where people share and discuss scientific articles. And it made her a little anxious. \u201cPubPeer is typically used to point out errors in papers, and no scientist wants to find errors in their published work,\u201d Tackett tells me in an email. When she clicked through to the PubPeer comment, this is what she saw. A program called \u201cStatcheck\u201d was writing to inform her it had been the math in her paper.",
        "It\u2019s a strange sight: an enormous concrete obelisk, looking a whole lot like the Washington Monument, rising above the treetops about 10 miles east of Hopkinsville, Kentucky. It\u2019s the Jefferson Davis Monument, the obelisk in the world, erected in 1924 near the birthplace of the Confederacy\u2019s only president. \u201cIt\u2019s creepy here,\u201d my said. An obelisk in the middle of nowhere is creepy enough, but he was also referring to the other visitors \u2014 a few bikers, a few folks wearing Confederate flag everyone white. For most of them, the monument was more than a curiosity. It was a shrine.",
        "Even by his standards, Donald Trump\u2019s reaction to the release of an audio tape of him joking about sexually assaulting women was astonishing: The response is worse somehow pic. twitter. \u2014 Matthew Yglesias (@mattyglesias) October 7, 2016 He seamlessly pivoted from a devastating revelation about his own misogyny to pointing out that Bill Clinton is the Real Sexist. This is part of a pattern.",
        "The day after Hillary Clinton landed a devastating blow to Donald Trump over his history of sexism and crass comments about Alicia Machado at the first presidential debate, Cosmopolitan released an eerily profile of the former Miss Universe contestant. It\u2019s a slice of a new brand of feminist media afloat \u2014 one that\u2019s not afraid to be political. Hillary Clinton has noticed. \u201cLook, she wrote a post for the Toast,\u201d New York Magazine writer Rebecca Traister told me earlier this summer about Clinton\u2019s farewell post to the site home to feminist musings.",
        "Bon Iver\u2019s new album 22, A Million starts with one repeating note, a single finger on a wavering synth. Seconds later, on the opening track, \u201c22 (OVER S\u221e\u221eN),\u201d Justin Vernon\u2019s chopped up, voice presents the song\u2019s thesis: \u201cIt might be over soon. \u201d This mantra, Vernon says, means \u201cthe bad stuff might be over soon, but maybe the good stuff might be over soon. \u201d The takeaway: \u201cYou\u2019d better figure out how to enjoy this life and participate in it.",
        "Spain has emerged as Europe\u2019s unlikely economic star, boasting a growth rate that\u2019s twice the regional average. But you won\u2019t find anyone from the Spanish government taking a bow. That\u2019s because there is no Spanish government \u2014 or more precisely, there\u2019s only a caretaker government with tightly limited powers. Two national elections since last December have produced parliaments so fragmented that Spain\u2019s bickering political parties haven\u2019t been able to agree on a prime minister. The conservative Popular Party got the most votes in both the December and June ballots, but fell far short of a majority.",
        "Donald Trump apparently didn\u2019t sleep very well last night. At 3:20 am Eastern, he tweeted angrily about the news media. And then a little after 5 am, he started attacking Alicia Machado \u2014 the former Miss Universe the Clinton campaign is using to make a point about Trump\u2019s treatment of women \u2014 including repeating a debunked rumor that she starred in a sex tape. This isn\u2019t the first time Trump has fought back against his critics with the end result of amplifying a damaging story in the news media.",
        "Luke Cage predates the concepts of \u201cwoke,\u201d \u201crepresentation,\u201d and \u201cdiversity\u201d by 44 years. When the mercurial hero debuted in 1972, he was Marvel\u2019s answer to the popularity of early \u201970s blaxploitation films like Shaft and Superfly. And like those films, Cage \u2014 along with female and other nonwhite comic book characters Marvel created \u2014 came with a dilemma.",
        "Two weeks ago, we asked you to tell us which states belonged in the South. More than 40, 000 of you submitted responses over the course of a couple of days \u2014 and this is what the map you created looks like. 41, 947 Vox readers submitted the states they think belong in the South. The yellow outline shows which states garnered at least 50 percent of submissions. A state was considered Southern if it was included in at least 50 percent of submissions. And we found that 12 states made the cut."
