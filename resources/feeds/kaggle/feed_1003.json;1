        "The Department of Energy just released Revolution Now, an annual update on its progress in accelerating clean energy. Specifically, it focuses on advances in five technologies: wind power, solar power, distributed solar power, electric vehicles, and LEDs. DOE has also reduced the report to a \u201dsix charts\u201d post. However, we here at Vox understand that you, the modern media consumer, are a busy person, with many intriguing Facebook links to click while you pretend to work. You don\u2019t have time to go scrolling and wading through six whole graphs like you\u2019re on holiday or something. Have no fear.",
        "I spent Monday night clicking a button on my computer each time Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump interrupted each other (or host Lester Holt) during the first presidential debate. I ended up clicking that button a whole lot. The result was this graphic, produced about halfway through the debate, which quickly went viral. Hillary Clinton was interrupted 40 times in the first 26 minutes of the presidential debate. pic. twitter.",
        "At the presidential debate last week, Donald Trump hinted that he might not have paid federal taxes. And now, newly leaked tax documents from 1995 may tell us why he might have been able to do this. The information in Trump\u2019s 1995 tax returns shows that he could have taken advantage of a tax provision called the \u201cnet operating loss carryback and carryforward\u201d to avoid paying taxes for as much as 18 years. We don\u2019t hear about this part of the tax code often. It\u2019s a rule that most of us will never interact with.",
        "There are few voices in American letters who write more beautifully and more humanely than Junot D\u00edaz. D\u00edaz, who won a Pulitzer for The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao and received a MacArthur Genius Grant in 2012, writes about everything from love and fidelity to America\u2019s legacy of colonialism to nerd culture.",
        "Now this is a funny headline: \u201dCow farts can now be regulated in California.\u201d But it\u2019s also a tad misleading. These news stories really ought to emphasize cow belches. Belches are the big global warming problem! Cow farts are secondary. C\u2019mon, people. Okay, let\u2019s explain. Over the past few weeks, California has been passing a slew of ambitious global warming policies. That included SB 32, which mandates a 40 percent cut in overall greenhouse gases below 1990 levels by 2030.",
        "is a unique age. For many people at this stage of life, there\u2019s been a straightforward path up until this point. High school led to college; college led to a first job in the real world. And then all of a sudden, there\u2019s no obvious direction. The options are overwhelming, and it\u2019s hard to know which path to choose. The thought that life could go so many different ways can be paralyzing. I just turned 25, and I\u2019m trying to figure out how to claim this age.",
        "Hillary Clinton has made thinking in corporate America \u2014 also known as \u201dquarterly capitalism,\u201d a reference to the pressure companies feel to meet quarterly earnings predictions \u2014 a central issue in her campaign. That issue has been bubbling beneath the surface of policy discussion for years, but it\u2019s gained fresh attention as influential investors such as Warren Buffett and Lawrence Fink (of BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest asset holder) and politicians like Vice President Joe Biden, have stepped up to warn of the perils to our economy of turning away from a perspective.",
        "What\u2019s most interesting about the leaked audio of Hillary Clinton assessing the Bernie Sanders movement from February isn\u2019t what she says about Bernie Sanders or his supporters. It\u2019s what she says about herself. Clinton does not \u2014 contrary to Politico\u2019s initial, and quickly deleted, headline \u2014 mock Sanders\u2019s supporters or Sanders himself. And before a room of wealthy donors, she doesn\u2019t attack Sanders from the right \u2014 she doesn\u2019t argue that she\u2019s the only candidate who will save capitalism, or that a welfare state will crush America\u2019s entrepreneurial grit.",
        "The American economy in 2016 is full of contradictions. On the one hand, we\u2019re in an era of rapid technological progress. The internet has disrupted industries from retail to music. Emerging technologies like cars and virtual reality promise to take the trend a step further, creating whole new industries while rendering many conventional jobs obsolete. At the same time, the current recovery has delivered the weakest GDP growth in many decades. Incomes and worker productivity have grown slowly. Despite interest rates, business investment has been weak ever since the recession ended. So what\u2019s really going on?",
        "One of the literary world\u2019s biggest mysteries has been solved. That\u2019s not necessarily a good thing. On Sunday, Claudio Gatti published an article on the New York Review of Books\u2019 website alleging that he had determined the identity behind the notoriously private Italian author who writes under the pen name Elena Ferrante. (Gatti also published versions of the same article on French, Italian, and German websites.) Ferrante, he alleged, is in truth Anita Raja, an obscure translator who specializes in translating East Germany\u2019s women writers into Italian.",
        "So there we were, Andrew Sullivan and I, sitting at a wobbly table on my poorly manicured patio. We were supposed to meet at Andrew\u2019s apartment, but the cleaning crew showed up unexpectedly and took the place over. We considered a coffee shop, one of those hipsterish joints in a nearby DC neighborhood. But it was the middle of the week, and the crowds are hit or miss. If there were too many talking heads in there, the noise would drown out the recording. So that was no good either. The plan was to meet at 2 pm.",
        "The Trump Foundation \u2014 Republican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s personal charitable foundation, which has reportedly operated illegally and for personal gain \u2014 has been issued a order by the New York attorney general\u2019s office. \u201cBased on information received by the Charities Bureau to date, the Trump Foundation was engaged in solicitation or fundraising activities in New York State in 2016, is not and was not registered \u2026 and was thus not permitted to engage in such activity during this period,\u201d the order read. #BREAKING NY AG sends Cease and Desist to Trump Foundation for operating without proper certification. pic. twitter.",
        "This weekend, veteran broadcast journalist Tom Brokaw published a New York Times piece describing an experience that\u2019s becoming increasingly common: living with cancer. Brokaw, who spent more than 20 years as anchor and managing editor of NBC Nightly News, was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, an incurable cancer that forms in the blood plasma, three years ago at age 73. \u201dI still lead a busy professional and personal life,\u201d he writes.",
        "Of all the possible reactions to the news that Donald Trump reported a loss of nearly $1 billion to the IRS in 1995, surely the oddest is the one from Trump surrogates Chris Christie and Rudy Giuliani, who said it goes to show that Trump is a business \u201cgenius. \u201d The truth is that it doesn\u2019t take a genius to lose a billion bucks. Nor does it take a genius to do what the New York Times suggested Trump did and use a single year\u2019s worth of bad business moves to wipe out more than a decade in taxes.",
        "The Lincoln Memorial makes such a strong statement that its construction seems like a foregone conclusion: Of course we\u2019d build a memorial to Lincoln, and of course it would be a flagship monument in the National Mall. But the story behind the Lincoln Memorial\u2019s construction is a surprisingly complicated one, and it says something about the contortions that, even today, politicians have to undergo to become visionaries. The video above tells that story \u2014 and shows how the Lincoln Memorial nearly failed to reach completion.",
        "\u201cThe internet is still at the beginning of its beginning,\u201d writes Wired and Silicon Valley guru Kevin Kelly in his new book The Inevitable. Kelly argues that adding machine intelligence to everyday objects \u2014 a process he calls \u201ccognifying\u201d \u2014 \u201cwould be hundreds of times more disruptive to our lives than the transformations gained by industrialization. \u201d Is he right? Kelly\u2019s extreme optimism represents one pole of this debate. At the opposite pole is economist Robert Gordon, who believes the IT revolution is basically over.",
        "If you didn\u2019t grow up in Atlantic City, Donald Trump is probably still, to some degree, a punchline for you. He\u2019s a Young Jeezy lyric. He\u2019s a reality television star famous for capriciously firing people. He\u2019s a public figure so riddled with tics and catchphrases you\u2019re not sure where he ends and the Darrell Hammond impression begins. He\u2019s a Twitter iconoclast, or he\u2019s the guy who had a cameo in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.",
        "Here\u2019s an amazing fact: The number of people in extreme poverty fell by 114 million from 2012 to 2013. That is a simply massive decline, and it\u2019s not even the biggest drop in recent years. From 2010 to 2011, global poverty fell by 132 million people. From 2008 to 2013, the number fell by an average of 88 million people per year. If that rate of progress keeps up, global poverty will be eliminated in less than a decade.",
        "Gallup polled young Americans about whether they prefer Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton on a range of issues, and Trump holds the advantage on just one: \u201cgovernment regulation of Wall Street and banks,\u201d where he\u2019s ahead by 7 points. Trump\u2019s edge here is probably a legacy of the Democratic primary, where Clinton was repeatedly assailed by Bernie Sanders as relatively soft on Wall Street and where her paid speaking appearances for Goldman Sachs were a prominent issue.",
        "I have never been quite so confused as to how to interpret a vice presidential debate. Let\u2019s say Mike Pence shows up and crushes Tim Kaine. Unambiguously. Totally. Then what? What are we supposed to think about that? The message of recent VP picks is \u201cthis guy is going to influence me. \u201d The appeal of having Paul Ryan roaming Mitt Romney\u2019s White House was that he would push Romney toward a more stringent economic conservatism.",
        "The rest of the political world has spent the past several days dissecting a devastating report from the New York Times about Donald Trump\u2019s 1995 tax returns. Trump has spent it, at least in part, warning his followers that Hillary Clinton is about to steal the election. In two rallies over the weekend, Trump told his followers that Clinton is planning massive voter fraud in \u201dcertain areas\u201d (and asked them to serve as vigilante election monitors on his behalf).",
        "I\u2019m at the gynecologist for my Pap smear, feet in stirrups, idly wondering what Emily Post might have suggested as appropriate small talk for those moments when the person you are speaking to will be replying to your vagina. We\u2019ve been living in America for a few months now, having moved here from London for my husband\u2019s job. I needn\u2019t have worried \u2014 the doctor is doing all the talking. Delving deep with her speculum, she delves deeper into matters of the heart. Apparently, she is reading Gretchen Rubin\u2019s Happier at Home and finding it very instructive.",
        "Former President Bill Clinton\u2019s unexpected remarks about Obamacare \u2014 delivered Tuesday at a Hillary Clinton rally in Michigan \u2014 were so negative, they might have felt more at home in a Republican stump speech. \u201cYou\u2019ve got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care, and then the people that are out there busting it \u2014 sometimes 60 hours a week \u2014 wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half,\u201d Clinton said at a rally Tuesday morning in Flint, Michigan. \u201cIt\u2019s the craziest thing in the world.",
        "Here\u2019s your latest reminder about how deeply strange this election year is. 1) On Monday night, a sitting Republican senator in a swing state said that her party\u2019s presidential nominee would be a good role model for children. 2) This statement, which would be banal in any ordinary race, was immediately interpreted as a crippling gaffe that would imperil the senator\u2019s reelection. 3) So the senator soon issued a statement saying she \u201cmisspoke\u201d and clarifying that the party\u2019s nominee is not, in fact, a good role model. 4) However, she\u2019s still voting for him to become president.",
        "The vast majority of swing state and national polls that have been released since last week\u2019s first presidential debate suggest that Hillary Clinton is on track to win the presidency. Nationally, Clinton has led 10 out of 13 polls. On average, RealClearPolitics now estimates she leads Trump by 3. 7 percentage points, while HuffPost Pollster puts her lead at 6 percentage points \u2014 meaning she seems to have gotten a bump of a couple of points. In swing states, the news for Clinton has been even better.",
        "We know that health care in America is riddled with both racial and gender biases, but it turns out a doctor\u2019s political affiliation can also dramatically influence medical decisions. A new study found that when it came to heavily politicized issues \u2014 like abortion, firearm safety, and marijuana use \u2014 physicians\u2019 recommended treatments split along party lines. Republican doctors were far more likely to express concern over a patient with a history of abortion than Democratic doctors, citing possible mental health repercussions and actively discouraging future abortions.",
        "Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson thinks knowing stuff about foreign countries is a bad quality in a president, because it means you\u2019re more likely to launch wars. That is a thing that he actually said, in an MSNBC interview on Tuesday afternoon picked up by ThinkProgress\u2019s Alice Ollstein. \u201dThe fact that somebody can dot the i\u2019s and cross the t\u2019s on a foreign leader or a geographic location then allows them to put our military in harm\u2019s way,\u201d Johnson said to a Andrea Mitchell. This is an odd theory, to say the least.",
        "About the only thing Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump agree on in this election is the need for the federal government to spend a lot more on America\u2019s infrastructure. Clinton has proposed $275 billion over five years for roads, transit, airports, and other public works, paid for with higher corporate taxes. Trump has vowed to \u201cat least double\u201d that. Plenty of observers have applauded these proposals, arguing that vast new infrastructure spending is just the tonic America needs in the 21st century. But Harvard economist Edward Glaeser sees things differently.",
        "On Sunday, Colombian voters narrowly rejected the government\u2019s peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, in a stunning referendum vote that has thrown the peace process into disarray. The deal between the Colombian government and the Marxist rebel group was reached on August 24 after four long years of fraught negotiations. And just last Monday, it was signed by President Juan Manuel Santos and FARC leader Timoleon \u201cTimochenko\u201d Jimenez. All that was left was for voters to approve it in a nationwide referendum on Sunday.",
        "This year\u2019s Nobel Prize in physics goes to three men, who, in their work in the 1970s and 1980s, explained the very weird thing that happens to matter when you squish it down to a flat plane, or cool it down to near absolute zero. Half the prize goes to David Thouless of the University of Washington, and the other half is split between Duncan Haldane of Princeton University and J. Michael Kosterlitz of Brown. All the laureates were born in the UK."
