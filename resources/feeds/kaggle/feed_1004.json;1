        "One of the morbidly fascinating aspects of climate change is how much cognitive dissonance it generates, in individuals and nations alike. The more you understand the brutal logic of climate change \u2014 what it could mean, the effort necessary to forestall it \u2014 the more the intensity of the situation seems out of whack with the workaday routines of life. It\u2019s a emergency, but almost no one is acting like it is. And it\u2019s very, very difficult to be the only one acting like there\u2019s an emergency, especially when the emergency is abstract and grasped primarily by the intellect.",
        "During the primaries, Donald Trump had a tax proposal that was wildly irresponsible. It included massive tax cuts, without much of a plan to spend less. Now that he\u2019s one step closer to actually having to do the job, he has honed a slightly more realistic plan. But that\u2019s like saying a flying unicorn is impossible so you\u2019ll settle for a regular unicorn. We expect conservative nominees to propose tax cuts and spending cuts, and those two things are usually somewhat proportional.",
        "Luke Cage is the boldest thing Marvel has ever done. The show \u2014 the third Netflix series to center on a character from the entertainment juggernaut\u2019s vault of comic book heroes \u2014 isn\u2019t perfect. At times it\u2019s messy and bloated, in need of another edit. And it\u2019s not especially different in structure from its predecessors, Jessica Jones and Daredevil. Rating 4 But in the moments when Luke Cage clicks, it delivers a story with a complex social commentary, on a topic that it doesn\u2019t normally touch: blackness. The titular protagonist is, of course, a black superhero.",
        "Vice presidential debates are somewhat curious occasions. They pit against each other two contenders who have not been selected through any electoral process, and whose debate performance probably won\u2019t swing many, if any, votes. Indeed, it\u2019s unlikely anything about them will swing a significant number of votes. Who the hell votes based on the second person on the ticket? But the debate is still a useful event, despite its lack of obvious electoral consequences.",
        "Republican Party elected officials in contested races around the country have been grappling with a basic but profound issue all year \u2014 how do you stand up for the GOP and conservative principles and against Hillary Clinton without getting sucked into defending every crazy, offensive, or weird thing Donald Trump has said? It can be a tough line to walk, as New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte learned this week. Debating Tim Kaine Tuesday night, Mike Pence taught a master class in how it\u2019s done. Every time Kaine attacked, Pence parried and deftly shifted the conversation to something else entirely.",
        "Artwork, specifically paintings, can seem like it should be moderately cheap. How long could it take to screen print some tomato soup cans, right? Many websites I found during my research into art pricing coached new artists to think of time spent on the paintings like any job, counting by the hour. But how do you know if your time is worth $20, $2, 000, or even $20, 000?",
        "Fox News\u2019 Jesse Watters went to New York\u2019s Chinatown to ask people what they thought of Donald Trump and relations for The O\u2019Reilly Factor. Or at least that\u2019s what he said he was doing. What Watters was really doing was making fun of the people he encountered with the broadest, dumbest Asian stereotypes imaginable \u2014 making it clear they were there as props for him and his viewers for what he clearly considered a hilarious joke, rather than to actually give their opinions. \u201dAm I supposed to bow to say hello?\u201d Waters starts by asking two women.",
        "Google\u2019s Android dominates the smartphone market overall, but Apple has attracted a disproportionate share of users \u2014 and consequently an outsize share of smartphone profits. At a Tuesday event, Google unveiled a strategy to change that. Part one was the Pixel, the first smartphone that will be designed and manufactured by Google. Google is betting that building its own phone will allow it to offer the same kind of seamless user experience Apple provides its own users. But the second prong of Google\u2019s strategy is more original and received more attention on Tuesday.",
        "This year\u2019s Nobel Prize in Chemistry goes to three men who helped develop the world\u2019s tiniest machines \u2014 not out of miniature pistons or gears, but out of mere molecules. We\u2019re talking about motors, elevators, even cars just a few nanometers long: These machines could one day prove quite versatile, allowing scientists to develop artificial switches to release targeted drugs or develop new ways to store energy. The prize will be split between Sauvage, Sir J. Fraser Stoddart, and Bernard L.",
        "There\u2019s a long history of gerrymandering in this country, one that stretches back to the nation\u2019s founding. As early as 1788, there are reports of Patrick Henry (of \u201cGive me liberty or give me death\u201d fame) carving up Virginia districts in an attempt to sabotage James Madison\u2019s congressional campaign. Playing with district lines has remained a tradition in American politics ever since. Both parties have done it, and both parties have benefited from it. But something changed in 2010.",
        "No law requires presidential candidates to release their tax returns. As the media has repeatedly explained, however, doing so has been a powerful norm for decades. Yet economic theory predicts that candidates would voluntarily release their returns even in the complete absence of norms, laws, or an aggressive press corps. That\u2019s because, the theory goes, candidates face powerful \u201dmarket\u201d incentives to step forward. The reasons that this argument fails offer an important lesson about the limits of the economic worldview.",
        "If Hillary Clinton wins in November, Tim Kaine will be the first male subordinate of the first woman US president. He will be, in a way, the . He did not acquit himself well on that count during Tuesday night\u2019s vice presidential debate. Nominally, the debate was moderated by CBS News\u2019s Elaine Quijano. In practice, it wasn\u2019t exactly moderated at all. Kaine interrupted Pence (and Pence, to a lesser extent, interrupted Kaine) so often that entire minutes of the debate were lost to crosstalk.",
        "The Railway is one of the most impressive engineering feats in modern history. Begun in 1891 and completed 100 years ago today (per Google Doodle) it\u2019s the longest railroad line in the world. The 5, 772 miles of track connect Moscow to the Pacific port of Vladivostok. It was also the cause of a major war, which turned into one of Russia\u2019s most humiliating defeats: the War starting in 1904.",
        "When it comes to clean energy, a few sexy technologies \u2014 solar panels, electric cars \u2014 get all the headlines. I blame you, the reading public. That\u2019s what you click on! But the workhorses of the clean energy transition, especially in the early years, are apt to be boring old technologies nobody writes about, some of which may already be in your home. For example, the rising need for energy storage may be partly answered by . .. the water heater, that unlovely white cylinder thing in your basement.",
        "If you were trying to come up with a headline that perfectly demonstrated why so many people have turned against keeping marijuana illegal, you probably couldn\u2019t do better than this real headline from the Daily Hampshire Gazette in Massachusetts: \u201cRaid! National Guard, State Police descend on \u2019s property to seize single pot plant. \u201d The story is just as absurd as it sounds. On September 21, the Massachusetts National Guard and State Police descended on Margaret Holcomb\u2019s home in Amherst using a helicopter to chop down a single marijuana plant that they claim was in \u201cplain view.",
        "At the vice presidential debate, both running mates were asked to address their candidates\u2019 tax plans \u2014 both of which would add to the national debt. That is true, according to nonpartisan analysts, but here\u2019s a key point that was never brought up: Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan would add about $200 billion to the debt over 10 years. Donald Trump\u2019s plan would add $5. 3 trillion \u2014 and this is the revised, more responsible version of the plan. We expect conservative nominees to propose tax and spending cuts, and those two things are usually somewhat proportional.",
        "The oldest human on record reached the age of 122. She was a French woman, named Jeanne Louise Calment, and in her lifetime of 1875 to 1997, she got to witness an unprecedented period of innovation and growth human history. In 1875, the invention of radio was still decades away. In 1997, 70 million people were on the internet. She got to see changes in technology usually reserved for time travelers in the movies. If living to 122 sounds cool, a new study has some bad news: Your chances of getting there are very slim.",
        "Deutsche Bank, Germany\u2019s largest bank, is facing its biggest crisis since the global financial meltdown in 2008. A couple of weeks ago we learned that US regulators were seeking to fine the company $14 billion \u2014 not just a large sum of money but actually enough to fundamentally threaten the viability of the bank.",
        "In Poland on Monday, thousands of women in 60 cities went on strike, dressed in all black, and protested in the streets against a proposal to ban all abortion in Poland with no exceptions. And on Thursday Poland\u2019s parliament voted down the controversial bill, 352 to 58. Remarkably, the Guardian reported Wednesday, the \u201dBlack Monday\u201d protests seem to have really worked in convincing Poland\u2019s conservative government to reject the ban.",
        "Two of Fox News\u2019s biggest stars are publicly feuding about Donald Trump \u2014 and the spat says a whole lot about where the network is now and how it\u2019s grappling with the GOP nominee\u2019s rise. In a tweet Wednesday night, Fox News host Sean Hannity lashed out at his colleague Megyn Kelly, accusing her of \u201dclearly\u201d being a Hillary Clinton supporter \u2014 a dangerous allegation for a star at the conservative network: @megynkelly u should be mad at @HillaryClinton Clearly you support her. And @realDonaldTrump did talk to u. https: .",
        "After a week of feuding with Alicia Machado \u2014 a Hillary Clinton supporter and a former Miss Universe whom Donald Trump once called \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d for gaining weight \u2014 Trump says he can explain his past comments: \u201cA lot of that was done for the purpose of entertainment,\u201d Trump told KSNV reporter Jim Snyder while campaigning in Las Vegas. Trump has a long history of using sexist language. He has called women \u201cfat pigs\u201d and \u201cslobs\u201d and salaciously commented on women\u2019s attractiveness.",
        "Snapchat is working on an initial public offering, which would allow members of the public to become investors in one of the internet\u2019s hottest startups. That\u2019s according to the Wall Street Journal, which reports that Snapchat expects to value the company at around $25 billion. If you\u2019re under 30, you\u2019re probably excited at the prospect of one of your favorite apps getting some recognition from Wall Street. If you\u2019re over 30, on the other hand, you\u2019re probably bewildered that an app you\u2019ve never used could possibly be worth $25 billion.",
        "The forecasts for Hurricane Matthew, now a Category 4, on the East Coast for Florida are growing dire. The hurricane is expected to scrape along the shore beginning Thursday night with 145 mile per hour winds. And the predictions for what it will bring are grim: storm surges along the coast of 6 to 9 feet; up to 12 inches of rain. Trees and power lines will be knocked down. Houses may get destroyed or severely damaged. \u201cThis storm will kill you,\u201d Florida Gov. Rick Scott warned Thursday.",
        "The idea that a red apple is a delicious apple is one of the greatest frauds ever perpetrated against Americans. The apples we\u2019re supposed to eat to keep doctors away, the apples we\u2019re supposed to give to teachers to show our appreciation, the apples we compare to oranges \u2014 all of them are a deep, predictable red, and none of them are delicious. The apple variety known as Red Delicious has, according to the US Department of Agriculture, dominated the apple industry since at least 1980.",
        "Here\u2019s something I never thought I\u2019d say: I just went back to work after a maternity leave. This state of affairs is unexpected in part because I\u2019m an American, and maternity leave for many women in America is six to 12 weeks \u2014 and much of that requires stockpiling and then cashing in your vacation. Let\u2019s take a moment and all laugh out loud at the idea that newborn care has anything to do with vacation.",
        "Donald Trump wants to run the American government. He has no prior experience in politics or government service, pointing instead to his career in business. But as the operator of mostly privately owned companies, Trump has primarily been in it just to enrich himself. A more illuminating aspect of Trump the businessperson was his stint as chair of a public traded company \u2014 a scenario in which he was supposed to be the steward of not just his own interests but those of the company\u2019s shareholders.",
        "Alain de Botton is an author, philosopher, and founder of the School of Life, a institute \u201cdevoted to developing emotional intelligence through the help of culture. \u201d De Botton, the author of several including How Proust Can Change your Life and Religion for Atheists: A Guide to the Uses of Religion, has made a career of concretizing big ideas for general audiences. His books and lectures are broad in scope but always return to the original question of philosophy: \u201cHow do we live well?\u201d His views on religion are especially compelling.",
        "Parts one and two of this series on Israeli settlers cover the West Bank. This final installment focuses on the settlers of Jerusalem who are the ideological epicenter of the conflict. Watch the video, which explores life in the middle of this conflict: Unlike the settlers of the West Bank, who often move there for reasons, those living in East Jerusalem settle almost entirely for ideological reasons. Their mission is to claim land in the city that holds deep historical significance to them as religious Jews.",
        "Donald Trump already has an excuse if he loses the election in November: It\u2019s rigged. But do Trump\u2019s supporters believe it? On Full Frontal, Samantha Bee sent her team to Trump rallies to find out. And it turns out they do believe the election will be rigged \u2014 but only if Trump loses. Here\u2019s one such exchange, between Full Frontal correspondent Amy Hoggart and a Trump supporter: TRUMP SUPPORTER: The election is definitely rigged. HOGGART: Is that just protecting himself before the results in case he loses? TRUMP SUPPORTER: No. He won\u2019t lose.",
        "Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and machine learning are enabling computers to understand the world and respond intelligently to it. Google is already embracing these technologies for Android, but they\u2019re poised to have bigger implications, touching everything from drones to medical diagnosis. At least that\u2019s the view of Marc Andreessen, a prominent venture capitalist at the firm Andreessen Horowitz. And he should know. He made his fortune as of Netscape two decades ago, and more recently his firm has invested in successful companies like Facebook, Twitter, Airbnb, Slack, and Lyft."
