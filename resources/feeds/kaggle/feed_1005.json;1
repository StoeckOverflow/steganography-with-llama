        "Donald Trump is turning American political norms upside down in many ways, and the way he treats women is no exception. Leaked audio reveals Trump basically bragging about committing sexual assault. Trump\u2019s many other misogynistic comments are so brazen and crude, and his alleged history of lewd behavior so long and rampant, that it\u2019s almost hard to believe. But the obviousness of Trump\u2019s sexism is also what makes it dangerous. Trump is threatening to shift the center of gravity of what we consider \u201csexism\u201d and lower our expectations for what counts as an attack on women.",
        "Donald Trump made some ugly comments about women in 2005, and they might haunt him for the next 31 days. The Washington Post published a secretly recorded video that captures Trump talking about what you can do to women if you\u2019re a famous man: They let you do it. You can do anything. Grab \u2019em by the pussy . .. I did try and fuck her. She was married. I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping.",
        "The way Donald Trump talks about women when everyone can hear \u2014 or read on Twitter \u2014 is pretty offensive. Imagine what he\u2019s like in private. A newly released secret video from 2005 captures it. Here\u2019s what Trump says about the norms of being a famous man: \u201cThey let you do it. You can do anything. Grab \u2019em by the pussy. \u201d The recording, obtained and published by the Washington Post, is from a day when Trump made an appearance on the soap opera Days of Our Lives.",
        "Late Friday afternoon, the US intelligence community made it official: Washington believes Moscow is intentionally meddling in the November US elections. The claim came in a joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and the Director of National Security published on the DNI website. The two agencies formally accused Russia of hacking the Democratic National Committee and dumping its private emails to WikiLeaks, which published them just before the Democratic convention in July.",
        "Election Day is still a month away, but there are signs that Hillary Clinton might be on stronger footing than even her edge in the polls suggests. The main reason is that early voting \u2014 whether by mail or in person \u2014 has already begun in a number of states, and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign believes they are winning the early voting battle. On a conference call with journalists Thursday afternoon, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said that \u201cstates like Nevada, North Carolina, and Florida could be decided before Election Day\u201d based on strong early voting results.",
        "In the first presidential debate, Donald Trump treated us to the spectacle of a man too lazy, undisciplined, and to bother preparing for an important moment. So ahead of the second debate, Trump\u2019s team is trying to get him to take it more seriously. For instance, Thursday night in New Hampshire they had Trump do an event in the town hall format rather than his usual rallies. And it seems like it was a total disaster.",
        "Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both talk tough about stepping up the fight against ISIS and finding a way to reduce Syria\u2019s carnage. The problem is that neither one has a clear explanation of how they\u2019d do it. During the final presidential debate Wednesday night, Clinton struggled to square her repeated promises not to send ground troops back into Iraq with the cold reality that the Obama administration already has nearly 5, 000 US forces on the ground there.",
        "\u201cAre you leaving?\u201d my neighbor Sarah asked me. It was Tuesday morning. I was sitting on the front porch of my home just north of Daytona Beach, Florida, admiring the flowers on the aloe vera plants. I had no idea what Sarah was talking about. I had been following the news out of Haiti of how Hurricane Matthew was destroying everything in its path, but hadn\u2019t thought much of its ability to affect us. When my partner and I signed the lease on the house back in January, we were told repeatedly that this part of Florida was .",
        "Hours before audio surfaced that featured Donald Trump essentially boasting about routine sexual assault, President Obama was signing a landmark piece of legislation to help victims of sexual assault seek justice. For the first time, thanks to the bill President Barack Obama signed on Friday, victims of sexual assault now have a specific set of rights under federal law when it comes to the forensic evidence collected from their own bodies after an assault. \u201cBeginning today, our nation\u2019s laws stand firmly on the side of survivors of sexual assault,\u201d said Sen.",
        "The 2016 Nobel Peace Prize Winner, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, seems like an eminently deserving winner. Since taking office in 2010, he has worked tirelessly to end a devastating civil war with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) a group of Marxist guerrillas that has been waging an insurgency against the government since 1964. In August, Colombia and the FARC inked a final peace deal. There\u2019s just one problem: Five days before Santos got his award, Colombian voters rejected the peace deal in a national referendum by a 50. .8 margin.",
        "High above the glassy waters of Hebgen Lake, just outside of West Yellowstone, I\u2019m armed with an can of pepper spray and scanning for grizzly bears. I know they\u2019re here: The mud is indented with prints. Claw marks and clumps of coarse hair extend 9 feet up the pine trees. Freshly deposited on the path, mounds of feces catch the sun. In the past five years, three people have been killed by bears in nearby Yellowstone National Park. During that time, 20 million tourists have come through the park.",
        "Donald Trump still refuses to recognize the innocence of the Central Park Five, a group of black and Latino teens wrongfully accused of brutally raping a jogger in New York\u2019s famed park, 14 years after their exoneration. Yusef Salaam, one of the Central Park Five, told CNN on Thursday that the group is still seeking an apology from the GOP nominee. After the woman\u2019s story made headlines, Trump took out a ad in the New York Daily News in 1989 with the headline \u201cBRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY. BRING BACK OUR POLICE!\u201d even before the trial began.",
        "There\u2019s a link between never having left your hometown and liking Donald Trump \u2014 especially if you\u2019re white. That\u2019s according to the results of a new poll by PPRI. It found that 40 percent of likely voters who support Donald Trump live in the same town or community where they grew up, compared with only 29 percent of likely Clinton voters. A full 71 percent of Clinton voters have left their hometowns, and of that group, almost 60 percent now live more than two hours away.",
        "Implausible schemes to put Mike Pence, rather than Donald Trump, on the top of the ballot have been flying since a recording of Trump\u2019s lurid boasting about sexual assault leaked to the public on Friday evening. Pence has issued a public statement on Trump\u2019s remarks, saying he \u201cdoes not condone his remarks and cannot defend them\u201d \u2014 but accepted Trump\u2019s apology and suggested he\u2019d stick by him through the second presidential debate on Sunday night. Anonymous sources say privately Pence is \u201cbeside himself\u201d over the details in the leaked audio.",
        "Republicans are horrified and shocked by the leaked audio in which Donald Trump brags about sexual assault and says his celebrity lets him do whatever he likes with women.    The many women whom Trump has reduced to their looks and sex appeal over the years  \u2014   39, according to our count  \u2014   probably aren\u2019t surprised. It\u2019s a long, damning list, and it\u2019s only getting longer.       (function()  ;   if( typeof( pym) === \u2019undefined\u2019)   else   })();",
        "It\u2019s too early to say with any certainty how Donald Trump\u2019s \u201dgrab \u2019em by the pussy\u201d comments will hurt him in the polls. But it certainly seems likely to leave a mark. When Trump suffered his worst stretch of press this August \u2014 feuding publicly with a Gold Star family; suggesting his Democratic rival should be shot \u2014 he fell behind Hillary Clinton by as many as 7 points in the polls. If this new tape has a similar effect, Clinton could obviously expect an easy victory.",
        "On Friday night, after the leak of a 2005 audiotape in which Donald Trump bragged that \u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab \u2019em by the pussy. You can do anything,\u201d Trump tried to tell you that this isn\u2019t who he really is. \u201cAnyone who knows me knows these words don\u2019t reflect who I am,\u201d Trump said in a videotaped apology statement. You should not believe him.",
        "The conventional wisdom about young voters in the 2016 presidential election goes something like this: White millennials are backing candidates in unprecedented numbers, creating a major problem for Hillary Clinton. It\u2019s a theory that\u2019s driven hundreds of news articles and think pieces. I myself have advanced it in stories here at Vox. Clinton\u2019s campaign appears to be taking the threat seriously. But Jon Rogowski, a political scientist at Harvard, makes a pretty convincing case that this idea is wrong \u2014 or at least vastly overstated.",
        "Donald Trump was caught saying some pretty vulgar things about women when we assume he thought no one else would hear. While wearing a hot mic before taping a segment for Access Hollywood, Trump touts that fame allows him to grope and kiss women without asking for consent. He says he can just grab women by their, um, genitalia. But nearly just as disturbing is Access Hollywood\u2019s Billy Bush, egging him on, shouting \u201cYes, the Donald has scored!\u201d once they spot the actress Arianne Zucker, who\u2019s also involved in the segment they\u2019re about to film.",
        "Pew Research is out with a big new survey on public attitudes toward climate change. It contains disturbingly little that\u2019s new. Instead, it found exactly what pollsters have been finding for decades: Public opinion on climate change is split along partisan lines. And it\u2019s not just about whether climate change is happening. \u201dPolitical differences over climate issues extend across a host of beliefs about the expected effects of climate change, actions that can address changes to the Earth\u2019s climate, and trust and credibility in the work of climate scientists,\u201d Pew says in the new report.",
        "The Iron Fist has arrived. At New York Comic Con on Saturday, Marvel dropped the first official trailer for Iron Fist, its latest Netflix series and the final series before its Netflix heroes \u2014 Daredevil, Jessica Jones, and Luke Cage \u2014 team up as the Defenders. (That series will launch later in 2017. Iron Fist premieres in March.) Judging by the trailer, Iron Fist seems more in line with Daredevil than Jessica Jones or Luke Cage. Hallway fight scene? Check. Martial arts? Check. Bad guys with axes in the hallway fight scene? Check.",
        "Dear Donald Trump, Last Friday, audio leaked of you making incredibly demeaning comments about women and bragging about sexual assault. When asked to justify your statements, you claimed that this was \u201dlocker room talk,\u201d and it\u2019s just how guys speak about women. You\u2019re wrong, and only the type of wrong an ham hock like yourself can accomplish, plummeting past the morass of gross incivility into the abyss of depraved sociopathy. How do I know this? Simple.",
        "It was clear going into the second presidential debate that this would be no ordinary political event. This would be huge. It would be the first time Donald Trump would have to defend his hot mic comments bragging about sexual assault in front of a hostile opposing candidate and tough moderators. It would be the defining moment of the election, a glorious train wreck. It would be \u201cwhatever the opposite of the moon landing is. \u201d And oh, dear reader, it was. It really, really was.",
        "At Sunday\u2019s debate, Donald Trump revealed that he is not running to be America\u2019s president so much as its dictator. The debate\u2019s most unnerving moment came early. \u201cIf I win, I\u2019m going to instruct the attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there\u2019s never been so many lies, so much deception,\u201d Trump told Hillary Clinton. \u201cIt\u2019s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law of our country,\u201d Clinton shot back.",
        "There is no way to sugarcoat this: At Sunday night\u2019s presidential debate, Donald Trump threatened to throw Hillary Clinton in jail if he wins the presidency. This \u2014 threatening to jail one\u2019s political opponents \u2014 is how democratic norms die. The exchange happened during a discussion of the controversy over Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server. Trump began by decrying Clinton\u2019s conduct \u2014 which, according to the FBI, was quite bad but not illegal.",
        "Since the 1990s, crime rates in the US have plummeted \u2014 with the murder and violent crime rates dropping by more than half. Americans, it turns out, have no idea. A new Consult poll measured how nearly 2, 000 registered voters perceive crime both in their neighborhoods and in America more broadly. The poll found that 69 percent of US voters think there is more crime in the US than there was two decades ago, with 43 percent saying there is \u201cmuch more\u201d crime and 26 percent saying there is \u201csomewhat more\u201d crime.",
        "On Sunday night, with fewer than two hours to go before the second presidential debate, Donald Trump appeared on Facebook live with four women who have accused Bill Hillary Clinton of wronging them: Juanita Broaddrick (who claims Bill Clinton raped her in 1978 and Hillary then intimidated her) Kathy Shelton (who was raped at 12, and whose rapist was represented in court by Hillary Clinton) Kathleen Willey (who accused Bill Clinton of groping her in 1993) and Paula Jones (who accused . Clinton of exposing himself to her in 1991).",
        "Climate change is one of the most critical issues facing humanity for, oh, the next 10, 000 years, but we\u2019ve barely heard about it in this presidential campaign. So let\u2019s quickly recap the difference between Trump and Clinton on global warming. Because it\u2019s really quite simple \u2014 and stark. Clinton: Hillary Clinton wants to use various regulatory levers at the president\u2019s disposal to nudge down US greenhouse gas emissions bit by bit. Tighten standards for vehicles here; plug methane leaks from natural gas infrastructure there. Defend President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan to reduce CO2 from coal plants.",
        "\u201dWhy can\u2019t I watch that show right now?\u201d someone asked me on Twitter after I tweeted about The Drew Carey Show. (I\u2019m sure you will agree that it was vital to the fate of the republic that I conduct a Twitter poll as to which of the sitcom\u2019s three main opening credits sequences was best.) But it was true! You can watch Drew Carey\u2019s pilot on Amazon with a subscription, but additional episodes will cost you $2 a pop. When you consider the show made over 200 episodes, it hardly seems worth it.",
        "When you put together everything we know about Donald Trump, it\u2019s terrifying. Over the past year and a half, there has been a lot of reporting done on what\u2019s perhaps the biggest question of the 2016 presidential campaign: Who is Trump? What we\u2019ve learned should not give anyone much comfort. This is a man who\u2019s just one election away from becoming the leader of the most powerful country in the world. Yet he\u2019s also someone who has time and time again proven to be corrupt, sexist, racist, and all sorts of other ."
