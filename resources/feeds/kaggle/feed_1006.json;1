        "On Tuesday, Hillary Clinton unveiled what is arguably among the most important policies she\u2019s announced during her entire presidential campaign. It is an ambitious but politically attainable plan that will lift huge numbers of families with children out of poverty. It is targeted exclusively at the poor, and the extreme poor in particular, with no money spent on the middle class or rich. Specifically, Clinton is calling for a change in the refundability threshold of the child tax credit. That sounds like a technical change, but it has tremendous ramifications.",
        "Almost everyone \u2014 even those who agree with Donald Trump that his recently leaked comments about grabbing women\u2019s genitals and getting away with it because of his fame were \u201clocker room talk\u201d \u2014 agrees that the remarks were vile and . But a debate has surfaced about the way the comments are being characterized beyond that. It centers on whether the behavior the Republican presidential nominee bragged about, if it did actually happen, would constitute sexual assault. As Vox\u2019s Emily Crocket has written, many Trump supporters and surrogates bristle at that \u201csexual assault\u201d label.",
        "Bill Clinton made a very specific critique of Obamacare last week \u2014 one that most Democrats won\u2019t. \u201cThe people that are getting killed in this deal are \u2026 individuals who make just a little too much to get any of these subsidies,\u201d Clinton said while campaigning last week in Flint, Michigan. \u201cPeople are out there busting it [and] wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. \u201d This was not just some riff. Clinton was addressing a serious problem with Obamacare. It\u2019s one that people like Julianna Pieknik know all too well.",
        "As a I have a hard time talking about the ethics of animal agriculture. I can\u2019t justify myself. Our industrial farming system is a moral (and ecological) horror, and to the extent that I participate in that, I\u2019m complicit. But I just can\u2019t kick meat. Like many Americans, I\u2019ve learned to live with my contradictions. Bruce Friedrich is the Executive Director of The Good Food Institute in Washington, DC, an organization that partners with scientists, investors, and entrepreneurs to create cleaner and safer food products.",
        "A lot of people are worried about the growing ranks of jobless young men. George Will says America is suffering a \u201cquiet catastrophe\u201d in which men simply no longer want jobs. Erik Hurst, an economist at the University of Chicago, recently came up with a novel theory to explain this. He suggested that young American men aren\u2019t working because they\u2019re too busy having fun playing video games and living in their parents\u2019 basement.",
        "He\u2019s trailing Hillary Clinton by double digits in some polls, but Donald Trump has now adopted a promising strategy that could rejuvenate his flailing campaign. Haha, just kidding! Trump has decided to declare war on his own party via Twitter, attacking Paul Ryan and turning the GOP into a circular firing squad just four weeks from Election Day. Despite winning the second debate in a landslide (every poll) it is hard to do well when Paul Ryan and others give zero support! \u2014 Donald J.",
        "Quick: What\u2019s the most influential thing about Breaking Bad, the hugely acclaimed AMC drama about a high school chemistry teacher who starts cooking meth to build up a nest egg for his family, in the wake of his cancer diagnosis? You could make an argument for how the show heightened the antihero drama, or for how it was one of the most smoothly executed serialized dramas in history. But it was more of an evolutionary step than a revolutionary one in terms of both of those categories.",
        "Hurricane Matthew may have wandered out to sea, but the watery mess it left behind in North Carolina keeps getting worse and worse. The hurricane dumped record amounts of rainfall on the state over the weekend, and floodwaters are still rising as rivers continue to fill up and overtop their banks. These floods have already killed 17 people in North Carolina and left thousands stranded in their homes or on their rooftops, waiting to be rescued. In some areas, the flooding isn\u2019t likely to peak until Friday, as rivers keep swelling.",
        "Two years ago, my friend Thomas wrote in the Washington Post that he\u2019d just saved someone\u2019s life and he was thrilled about it. Thomas had donated a kidney to start a chain of transplants. His post got a lot of kind words, a few Facebook shares, and, as of today, eight comments. Recently a medical student, Michael Poulson, published an article under the headline \u201dAt 18 years old, he donated a kidney. Now, he regrets it.\u201d The reaction was very different: His post went viral and inspired more than a thousand comments on the Washington Post website.",
        "It\u2019s very rare to find yourself wanting more of anything on the last day of New York Comic Con. The pop culture bonanza is a sensory overload. Casting announcements are made. Trailers, teasers, sizzle reels, and sneak peeks are shown. Panel discussions are held to examine every detail of every comic book topic imaginable. By the end of the convention, it all bleeds together, and nothing feels fresh.",
        "After last week\u2019s revelations of Donald Trump\u2019s raunchy braggadocio, his opponents feel warmly vindicated. They knew it all the time. But they remain incredulous. How, they still ask, could such a vulgar jerk have ended up a nominee for president? In this, they fail to recognize a core aspect of his appeal \u2014 not his specific policies or economic acumen, but his ability to subvert social norms that many people have come to loathe. For example, early in his campaign, Trump took to making a certain terse directive a feature of his rallies.",
        "Less than a month from Election Day, Donald Trump is behind by double digits in the polls. It\u2019s clear his campaign needs to do everything it can to get out the vote. It\u2019s also clear that Trump does not have a normal campaign; it is small, apparently disorganized, and, compared with Hillary Clinton\u2019s operation, woefully behind in conventional campaign tactics. Trump is notably lagging. In September, his then newly appointed campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said it was her intention to overhaul the campaign\u2019s ground game tactics. \u201dMr. Trump is an unconventional candidate, but I have an appreciation for .",
        "One of the tricky aspects of writing about climate change is that it often involves tossing around tiny numbers with large consequences. If, for instance, global average temperatures rise a mere 1. 5\u00b0C above levels, we start losing coral reefs. Go up to 2\u00b0C and we risk serious damage to our food supply. At 3\u00b0C, the ocean swallows even larger chunks of our coastlines. Each of those notches on the global thermometer, when unpacked across this vast planet of ours, has impacts on ice melt, drought, heat waves, and extinctions.",
        "I was in the audience on January 25, when The Birth of a Nation premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. The Eccles Theater was packed. I had to sit in the balcony. I confess that at the time, I had only a dim sense of who the film\u2019s writer, director, and star Nate Parker was, not having seen his starring turn in Beyond the Lights. But I could tell the hum of excitement was unusual. As has been widely reported, the film received not one but two standing ovations, one before it even started.",
        "Mormon voters are more conservative than most Americans and, overwhelmingly, more reliable Republican voters. But Donald Trump might be changing all that this election \u2014 a shift that could have dire consequences for Trump\u2019s already narrow prospects in November. After the release of a hot mic tape that revealed Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women, a striking poll in Utah \u2014 a heavily Mormon and typically solidly red state \u2014 showed Trump with 26 percent of the vote, putting him in a virtual tie with Hillary Clinton and Utahn candidate Evan McMullin, according to a report from Deseret News.",
        "I\u2019ve been dating online for the better part of the past decade. I joined OKCupid at the ripe young age of 23 when I moved to Brooklyn in 2009, after a particularly negative experience meeting someone the way. I then found myself on assignment at the media company for which I worked, to research the dating market. So I was early on HowAboutWe (RIP) Grouper, Tinder, Hinge, the League, Bumble, Coffee Meets Bagel. Early for an American user on my personal favorite dating app, the Happn. An early tester for the matchmaking service the Dating Ring.",
        "In politics, as in war, you have to fight with the army you have. But when it comes to this year\u2019s battle for the House of Representatives, Democrats are sending some extraordinarily green recruits to the front lines. In New Jersey\u2019s Third District, Democrats are running someone who has been unemployed for the past six years and has a checkered history of failed debt payments. They have a beekeeper with no elected experience taking on a powerful incumbent in the California 10th.",
        "Blue Lives Matter, a group of active and retired law enforcement officials, issued a statement on Monday demanding all Americans boycott Ben & Jerry\u2019s after the ice cream maker announced its public support of Black Lives Matter last week. \u201cBen & Jerry\u2019s went beyond making a statement in support of civil rights when they actively accused law enforcement of widespread racism,\u201d Blue Lives Matter wrote. \u201cBy spreading these false and misleading statements, Ben & Jerry\u2019s lends an appearance of legitimacy to the baseless claims that police officers are killing men based on the color of their skin.",
        "By the time 500 people were angrily combing the streets on October 3, looking for dangerous cosplayers in what is now being called \u201cthe Penn State clown riot,\u201d it was clear the nation had a serious clown problem on its hands. But it\u2019s not the one you think. CLOWNS have caused riots and clown hunting at penn state this is the end pic. twitter.",
        "Appearing on Chris Hayes\u2019s MSNBC show on Monday night, New York magazine reporter Rebecca Traister best captured exactly what made the second presidential debate feel so \u2026 gross. Here\u2019s part of the transcript: TRAISTER: To have first of all the tape, in which [Donald Trump] is openly sort of literalizing this way that he\u2019s been talking about women throughout. We have the pattern of him talking about them as objects, evaluating them aesthetically and sexually, and talking about, you know, women who breastfeed or pee as disgusting. HAYES: Things for one\u2019s use. TRAISTER: Right.",
        "Comedy Central\u2019s Drunk History is an unabashedly ridiculous show. Comedians get trashed and narrate hilarious, if not totally accurate, versions of historical stories; then the series enlists actors to their way through the narrator\u2019s giddy slurring. It\u2019s a whole lot of fun, but this week\u2019s episode was also quietly revolutionary in the simplest of ways: It cast transgender actresses to play transgender roles.",
        "During a campaign appearance for Hillary Clinton in Manchester, New Hampshire, Michelle Obama emotionally discussed the sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump. \u201dIt has shaken me to my core,\u201d she said. Watch it above. \u201dLast week, we saw this candidate actually bragging about sexually assaulting women,\u201d Obama said. \u201dAnd I can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m saying that a candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women. And I have to tell you that I can\u2019t stop thinking about this.",
        "Picking a fight with your own party\u2019s congressional leadership is not a very good strategy for trying to win a presidential election. But if you\u2019re Donald Trump and you\u2019ve been behind in the polls all year, blew it in two debates, were exposed bragging about routinely assaulting women, and are haunted by the knowledge that there\u2019s more damning video of you that might leak, it\u2019s time to forget about winning the election. What Trump needs to worry about is how he\u2019s going to explain his loss after it happens.",
        "On Tuesday, Nate Silver published a piece on FiveThirtyEight analyzing the gender gap in support for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. According to the Public Religion Research Institute Poll, Trump leads Clinton by 11 points among men while Clinton leads Trump by 33 points among women. The gap is considerably wider in other polls. For perspective, Silver aggregated the results from all the national polls and projected the Electoral College vote if only men or women participated. With women only voting, Clinton wins . With men only voting, Trump wins .",
        "Elizabeth Warren didn\u2019t run in the 2016 primaries and isn\u2019t on the ballot in November, but she\u2019s emerged as one of the most influential figures in Democratic Party politics. And an intriguing email sent by Hillary Clinton\u2019s chief speechwriter to other senior campaign officials (then given, likely by Russian hackers seeking to help elect Donald Trump, to WikiLeaks) sheds light on what it is she wants from the likely next president of the United States: Not specific policy commitments, but a drastic change in personnel serving in key agencies.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s speech rebutting the growing swirl of sexual assault charges around him has a lot going on in it, but for my money the most important section came in the middle, when Trump went into a attack on the press. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear on one thing,\u201d he said, \u201cThe corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism. \u201d Complaining about media coverage is nothing new from a political campaign, and certainly Hillary Clinton\u2019s team has leveled plenty of complaints of their own.",
        "Chris Hayes\u2019s book Twilight of the Elites came out to respectful reviews and respectable sales in 2012, yet the book\u2019s real moment is right now. Better than any other book, it explains why Donald Trump appeals to many voters, and why the political establishment has such a hard time understanding his success. In the book, Hayes, the host of an MSNBC show and an editor at large for the Nation, argues that many people on both the left and right have come to believe that the system is unfair.",
        "Sure, I like cheese, you like cheese, lots of people like cheese. But this is getting absurd. The United States is currently in the midst of an epic cheese glut \u2014 with 1. 2 billion pounds of cheese sitting in cold storage. If we wanted to patriotically eat through that surplus, every man, woman, and child would have to grab an extra 3 pounds of cheddar, Swiss, or provolone and start gnawing.",
        "Donald Trump denied a People magazine journalist\u2019s claim that he sexually assaulted her during an interview. His explanation: She\u2019s not attractive enough. On Wednesday, People magazine journalist Natasha Stoynoff alleged that Trump tried to forcibly kiss her while she was on assignment. She wrote that Trump brought her into a room, shut the door, \u201cand within seconds, he was pushing me against the wall, and forcing his tongue down my throat. \u201d On Thursday, Trump said it wasn\u2019t true. \u201cLook at her,\u201d Trump said during a speech. \u201cLook at her words. You tell me what you think.",
        "When several women came forward Wednesday night with allegations that Donald Trump had groped or kissed them without their consent, they were greeted in some quarters with suspicion. Many of these incidents had happened years earlier \u2014 why hadn\u2019t they come forward at the time? If they hadn\u2019t reported the assaults when they happened, didn\u2019t that make it more plausible that there had never been any assault? Trump\u2019s accusers never really got a chance to answer that question. Trump himself answered it for them."
