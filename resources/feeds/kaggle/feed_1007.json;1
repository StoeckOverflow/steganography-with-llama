        "Ever since Donald Trump won the Republican presidential nomination, conservative intellectuals have been grappling with how this could have happened. What happened to their party, they ask, that resulted in this monster becoming its leader? What you\u2019ve seen less of are conservative intellectuals actually making the case for Donald Trump. It\u2019s a testament to the degree to which Trump, and the movement behind him, is a product of a popular movement entirely distinct from the conservative movement that has dominated the GOP for decades.",
        "October is Breast Cancer Awareness month, and with the flurry of pink ribbons comes new studies about the harms and benefits of mammograms for screening. Every year, confusion ensues. The whole idea behind cancer screening is that it can help find the disease earlier \u2014 even before symptoms appear. With early detection, doctors should, in theory, be more likely to successfully treat the disease and control any spread.",
        "We know so very, very little about the universe, as a paper published in the Astrophysical Journal in October reminds us. We thought the observable universe contained billions of galaxies. But it seems there are at least 2 trillion galaxies out there \u2014 10 times greater than astronomers\u2019 previous estimates. Examining decades of data from the Hubble Space Telescopes and other observatories around the world, an international team of scientists now believe that 90 percent of the galaxies in the universe are \u201ctoo faint and too far away to be seen. \u201d But they are out there.",
        "The NFL preseason game on August 26 between the San Francisco 49ers and the Green Bay Packers began as an ordinary game. And as with any other game, before kickoff came the national anthem. But for 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, this preseason, so far, has been anything but business as usual. While everyone stood, right hands over their hearts as \u201cThe Banner\u201d played, Kaepernick pointedly sat down. \u201cI am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,\u201d he told NFL. com after the game.",
        "First a tape of Donald Trump from 2005, describing how he treats women \u2014 \u201dJust kiss, I don\u2019t even wait \u2026 Grab \u2019em by the pussy \u2026 When you\u2019re a star, they let you do anything.\u201d Then, on Wednesday night, three women came forward in media interviews to say that Donald Trump had, in fact, kissed them without consent or touched them inappropriately \u2014 two in interviews with The New York Times and another to the Palm Beach Post.",
        "On Wednesday night, stories started pouring in from women accusing Donald Trump of sexual assault \u2014 groping them or kissing them against their will much like Trump bragged about doing in a leaked audio recording. But almost immediately, Trump surrogates and others started calling their stories into question because of the timing. \u201cThese allegations are decades old,\u201d senior Trump adviser A. J. Delgado told Chris Hayes on MSNBC. \u201cIf somebody actually did that, Chris, any reasonable woman would have come forward and said something at the time.",
        "On September 11, 2016, the political media\u2019s attention was firmly fixed on Lower Manhattan, where Hillary Clinton unexpectedly ducked out of a memorial event. Video soon surfaced of her looking very unwell as she was assisted into a waiting SUV and whisked off to her daughter\u2019s apartment. It turned out she had a case of pneumonia that she\u2019d been hiding from the press.",
        "\u201cI have to tell you that I listened to all this. And I feel it so personally,\u201d first lady Michelle Obama said Thursday in remarks about the sexual assault and misconduct allegations against Donald Trump at a campaign appearance for Hillary Clinton in Manchester, New Hampshire. \u201cIt has shaken me to my core,\u201d she said. That\u2019s no wonder. She\u2019s been the victim of sexist attacks \u2014 often intertwined with racist themes \u2014 since her husband\u2019s 2008 run for the White House.",
        "Tom Tremblay has spent decades advocating for the prevention of sexual assault and domestic violence, first as a police officer in Vermont and now as a consultant. Much of his work focuses on how to improve law enforcement practices to make it easier for victims of sexual assault to come forward and report crimes. The fact that it took some women decades to report Donald Trump\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct doesn\u2019t surprise him at all. \u201cVictims may wait days, weeks, months, years, decades,\u201d he says.",
        "Is the Republican Party falling apart? Steve Schmidt \u2014 a GOP consultant who worked on George W. Bush\u2019s reelection campaign in 2004 and ran John McCain\u2019s campaign in 2008 \u2014 thinks it very well might be. \u201cThere will be the party; then there will be a conservative party,\u201d he told me on Thursday. \u201cI think what you\u2019re gonna see is [Trump campaign CEO and Breitbart News chief] Steve Bannon monetizing 30 percent of the electorate into a movement and a media business.",
        "Donald Trump knows how rape culture operates, and he\u2019s taking advantage of it. In an attempt to deflect attention from the cascading sexual assault accusations piling up against him, Trump took the national stage and insulted the looks, credibility, and integrity of the women who dared to come forward with their stories. The candidate is used to blaming others for his problems, but his reaction to these allegations is rather unique. Trump isn\u2019t just trying to attack these women; he\u2019s signaling to others who may come forward.",
        "At Sunday night\u2019s debate, Donald Trump twice threatened to throw Hillary Clinton in jail should he win the election. Putting Clinton in jail has been a recurring theme in Trump\u2019s campaign: For months, \u201clock her up\u201d has been a popular chant at Trump events \u2014 most notably at the Republican National Convention this summer. Besides being illegal, that\u2019s a really, really bad idea. I should know: I saw the same thing happen up close in Sri Lanka in 2010, when I was working as a reporter for a local newspaper, the Sunday Leader.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s supporters deserve to have their concerns taken seriously. If the media and commentators in 2016 can agree on nothing else, it\u2019s this. It\u2019s a bit of an odd meme. I can remember literally no one in 2012 dwelling on the importance of taking the concerns of Mitt Romney voters seriously, even though they made up a considerably larger share of the population than Trump supporters. No one talks about taking the interests of Hillary Clinton supporters, a still larger group, seriously.",
        "Climate change will never get solved in a single flourish. If the world\u2019s nations are ever going to stop the planet from warming unbearably, they\u2019ll have do so step by step, pushing down emissions across a dizzying variety of sectors and sources. And on Saturday, the world took one of the biggest, most promising steps yet. At a United Nations conference in Rwanda, 197 nations agreed to drastically reduce their use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) an obscure but extremely powerful greenhouse gas used in air conditioners, refrigerators, and foams. Without action, HFC use was expected to soar.",
        "Donald Trump is running as a rebel against \u201cpolitical correctness. \u201d His supporters believe that Americans have gotten too sensitive, that people can no longer express their opinions safely and openly without someone getting offended. Trump assures his followers that they\u2019re the underdogs: that the nation\u2019s most powerful institutions are dedicated to silencing their views. \u201cThe establishment and their media neighbors wield control over this nation through means that are very well known,\u201d he told them Thursday. \u201cAnyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist, rapist, xenophobe and morally deformed. They will attack you. They will slander you.",
        "In the whole history of American television, only one primetime scripted series has crested 600 episodes: the venerable Western Gunsmoke, which produced 635 episodes between 1955 and 1975. (TV shows produced far more episodes back then than the 22 episodes per season typical of broadcast series today.) But on Sunday, October 16, another series will join Gunsmoke in the 600 episodes circle. That series is The Simpsons, which has run 28 seasons since it debuted in December of 1989. It should pass Gunsmoke in the spring of 2018 (it\u2019s already producing episodes for the season) \u2014 and who knows?",
        "Remember the point in this presidential election cycle when real life didn\u2019t outpace satire? No? Neither does Saturday Night Live. At this point, SNL\u2019s spoofs on Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are just barely heightened versions of reality \u2014 there\u2019s no need to spruce up the truth; it\u2019s already ridiculous. Going to the well that is Alec Baldwin\u2019s Donald Trump and Kate McKinnon\u2019s always entertaining Hillary Clinton, the show\u2019s October 15 episode spoofed Trump and Clinton\u2019s ugly second debate in St. Louis, complete with Jaws music as a score for Trump lurking around the stage.",
        "In the weeks leading up to the presidential election, Donald Trump has urged his followers to spend time on Election Day intimidating nonwhite voters. He tells them that after they vote on November 8, it\u2019s their duty to go en masse to \u201csome other place\u201d and make sure that no one\u2019s engaging in voter fraud. \u201cGo sit there with your friends and make sure it\u2019s on the \u201d he\u2019s said. Trump doesn\u2019t explicitly say the \u201cother place\u201d needs to be somewhere nonwhite people are voting.",
        "\u201cMake America great again. \u201d Donald Trump\u2019s campaign slogan implies its critique. Isn\u2019t America great already? Apparently not. In recent days, though, Trump\u2019s distaste for America has come clearer. His frontal assault on the basic legitimacy of the country\u2019s presidential election is more than a rationalization \u2014 it\u2019s a tell, a revealed preference, a window into how little regard Trump has for the country he seeks to lead. America is great. And one of the reasons it\u2019s great is that it has a long history of peaceful, predictable transitions of power.",
        "The future of work in America is uncertain. What we know is that things are going to change. Technology will upend countless careers, workers across fields will be displaced, and it\u2019s not entirely clear how many jobs will be replaced. When driverless trucks are manufactured at scale, which will happen far sooner than many realize (as soon as five years) America\u2019s 3. 5 million truck drivers will be dispensable. That doesn\u2019t mean the profession of truck driving will disappear overnight, but it will shrink considerably.",
        "Donald Trump is insisting that there is voter fraud in US election. It\u2019s part of a barrage of tweets planting the seed that Americans elections are rigged: Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2016 But here\u2019s the thing: Voter fraud is exceedingly rare. Loyola Law School\u2019s Justin Levitt did a deep dive into every credible allegation of voter fraud from 2000 to 2014. This includes general, primary, special, and municipal elections.",
        "Back in 2014, Apple launched a massive project, Titan, to build a car. But a couple of years later, Apple is drastically scaling back its ambitions. According to Bloomberg, the company has given up on the dream entirely. Instead, it\u2019s focusing on writing car software that could power cars manufactured by traditional automakers. Silicon Valley moguls have gotten into the habit of jumping into new industries and quickly turning them upside down \u2014 as Apple\u2019s iPhone did to the cellphone industry. But Apple\u2019s car struggles are a reminder that not every industry is as ripe for disruption.",
        "On Saturday night, someone threw a flammable bottle into a Republican headquarters in North Carolina, setting much of the office inside ablaze. An adjacent building was with a swastika and the message, \u201cNazi Republicans Get Out of Town or Else. \u201d Local law enforcement has opened a criminal investigation. An official with the state\u2019s GOP called it an act of \u201cpolitical terrorism. \u201d The state\u2019s governor, Pat McCrory, lamented it as an \u201cattack on democracy. \u201d We still have no idea who committed the firebombing or why.",
        "I was making my daily rounds across the internet at my staff writing job when I found a photo starting to go viral. It showed a man in a helmet and lifejacket gently cradling a baby. The baby\u2019s mouth was slightly open, and the man\u2019s lips were squeezed together in a tight straight line. The man was a rescuer in the Mediterranean Sea between Libya and Italy. The baby was dead \u2014 one of 45 people who perished when their boat sank in late May. It was a startling image showing the horror of the ongoing migrant crisis.",
        "There\u2019s strong evidence that Russia is hacking Hillary Clinton\u2019s allies and handing the private information it steals to WikiLeaks, which promptly makes it public. The goal is to interfere with the US election to help Donald Trump win the presidency or simply to sow chaos that causes Americans to doubt the results. What hasn\u2019t been talked about is that Vladimir Putin has an unwitting ally: the American media, which is helping him accomplish that very task. It\u2019s not enough for WikiLeaks to publish hacked emails. Very few ordinary people actually go through raw data dumps.",
        "Global warming can sometimes feel like this big, hopelessly intractable problem that no one\u2019s doing much about. But the first two weeks of October have seen a genuinely impressive barrage of climate action around the world. Consider what\u2019s gone down so far: 1) Canada got a carbon tax. On October 4, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his government would implement a nationwide carbon tax starting in 2018. The tax will start at $7. 60 per ton of CO2 and rise to $38 per ton by 2022.",
        "Donald Trump really wants you to believe that the election is rigged \u2014 and he\u2019s citing voter fraud as proof. Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2016 Trump\u2019s claim is simply baseless \u2014 voter fraud is extremely rare.",
        "Alphabet, the parent company of Google, announced on Tuesday that it was curbing its expansion of Google Fiber, an ambitious effort to bring internet access to a number of metropolitan areas. It\u2019s the latest setback for those who hope to bring speeds of 1 gigabit per second \u2014 about 50 times faster than a typical connection \u2014 to every American. A few dozen cities in America have broadband networks that offer gigabit speeds. These connections were supposed to revolutionize Americans\u2019 experience of the internet and rev up the country\u2019s noncompetitive broadband market.",
        "Mild spoilers for both The Accountant and The Girl on the Train follow. Near the beginning of The Accountant, there\u2019s a flashback scene at a home for children with neurological disorders in which a young boy dumps out puzzle pieces on a table, and then becomes increasingly agitated when he can\u2019t find the last one. Eventually a young girl who resides at the facility picks up the final piece from the floor and hands it to the boy. The puzzle is solved.",
        "Donald Trump has accused unnamed Hillary Clinton allies of being the arsonists behind the firebombing of a Republican headquarters in North Carolina on Saturday. Taking to Twitter Sunday afternoon, Trump alleged that \u201canimals\u201d representing Clinton and Democrats in North Carolina had helped destroy the Republican Party\u2019s offices in Hillsborough, North Carolina. Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning @NCGOP \u2014 Donald J."
