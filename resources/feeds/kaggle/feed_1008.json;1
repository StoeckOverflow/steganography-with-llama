        "What is Westworld about? I don\u2019t mean that in a plot sense. In \u201dThe Stray,\u201d the show\u2019s third episode, the multitude of storylines I discussed last week continue to pile atop each other in a way that either works for you or makes you wish the show would calm down for three seconds. (The Man in Black mostly sits out this episode, so at least it feels slightly less busy.) On a thematic level, however, there are a bunch of ideas competing for space within Westworld, and I\u2019m not always sure they all serve the same ends.",
        "The recent presidential election polls have been mixed \u2014 but mostly between polls that are good for Hillary Clinton and polls that are fantastic for her. Clinton now leads Donald Trump in national polling averages by about 7 points, with every recent live interview poll showing her up by between 4 and 12 points.",
        "For many voters, and especially women voters, Donald Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy raises a central question loaded with fear: What happens if you give a person with a long history of abusing power even more power? More than a dozen women have now alleged that Trump assaulted, groped, or harassed them. The majority said the incidents occurred in professional situations, where he clearly had the upper hand. The leaked Access Hollywood audiotape from 2005 made clear Trump believed his \u201cstar\u201d status gave him special access to women\u2019s bodies, too.",
        "In June 2014, ISIS stunned the world by seizing Mosul, Iraq\u2019s city. It was touted as proof that this group was a new kind of terrorist threat \u2014 one that could take and hold territory. Shortly afterward, ISIS leader Abu Bakr declared his territory to be a caliphate, the Islamic State, at a speech in Mosul \u2014 the caliphate\u2019s crown jewel. Now Mosul is the last major Iraqi population center under ISIS control, with all others having already fallen to Iraqi government forces.",
        "Donald Trump is preparing to argue that if he loses the presidential election on November 8, that\u2019s only because it was \u201cstolen\u201d from him. So if Trump does go down to defeat, Republican and conservative leaders across the country will immediately face a choice on November 9. Do they play along with Trump\u2019s bullshit, or do they tell their voters the truth \u2014 that he lost fair and square? Now, this will be an incredibly important moment for democratic norms in the United States. Every losing major party presidential nominee in the modern era has recognized his opponent\u2019s victory.",
        "During the Democratic primary, one of the major climate policy differences between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton was a carbon tax. He supported one. She didn\u2019t. Now we have a little insight into why, via WikiLeaks\u2019 recent release of thousands of hacked personal emails from Clinton campaign manager John Podesta. \u201cWe have done extensive polling on a carbon tax,\u201d Podesta apparently told Clinton adviser Jake Sullivan back in January 2015. \u201cIt all sucks. \u201d Some of that polling can be found in this leaked presentation by Anzalone Liszt Grove Research to the Clinton campaign dating March 2015.",
        "Voters in four US cities will have the rare opportunity on November 8 to decide whether sugary beverages should be taxed, and billionaires and soda makers are pouring huge sums of money into swaying their choice at the polls. San Francisco, Oakland, and Albany, California, all have ballot measures that would levy a tax on distributors of sugary drinks. The people of Boulder, Colorado, will also vote on a excise tax on distributors. The stakes this year \u2014 for the beverage industry and for philanthrocapitalists who want to fight obesity \u2014 are high.",
        "Iceland \u2014 a land of glaciers, snow, and reindeer \u2014 is so hot right now. Among young professionals, the sparsely populated European country has suddenly become some sort of exotic pilgrimage: Facebook and Instagram feeds are filled with oversaturated images of fjords, colorful villages, and ice melt waterfalls. The country has been touted as an destination by a multitude of outlets, from Lonely Planet to National Geographic. In 1949 \u2014 the year the Icelandic Tourist Board began tracking foreign travelers \u2014 a paltry 5, 312 people came to visit.",
        "The third and at long last final general election presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will take place on Wednesday, October 19. The debate, which is in Las Vegas, Nevada, will last 90 minutes and be moderated by Fox News\u2019s Chris Wallace.",
        "Donald Trump is very publicly freaking out about election fraud. He has tweeted multiple times about it, complaining that the election will be rigged against him \u2014 conveniently, as Hillary Clinton\u2019s lead in the polls continues to grow. It\u2019s really no mystery where all this bluster \u2014 with no evidence of actual voter fraud to back it up \u2014 came from: the Republican Party. Over the past few years, Republicans in many states took an opportunity \u2014 enabled by a 2013 Supreme Court ruling \u2014 to pass a series of new restrictions on voting.",
        "Since Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign began, Melania Trump has refused to play the role of a typical campaign spouse. She\u2019s barely on the campaign trail. She doesn\u2019t give interviews, she doesn\u2019t host fundraisers, and she\u2019s proud of it. But on Monday night, in her interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, she was forced into the most traditional of political roles: the woman standing by her man, the political wife who must give an interview to render her husband\u2019s sexual misdeeds acceptable. Trump, defending her husband on the secret recording where he described sexually assaulting women, trotted out clich\u00e9s.",
        "The Harry Potter books have sold more than 400 million copies worldwide and been translated into more than 60 languages. The books are filled with a tricky mix of wordplay, invented words, songs, allusions, British cultural references, and more. Translators were tasked with adapting J. K. Rowling\u2019s devices to fit the language and culture of their target audience. Translators weren\u2019t given a \u2014 they had to wait until the English editions came out to begin the difficult and lengthy task of adapting the books. Working day and night, translators were racing against intense deadlines.",
        "There are only seven episodes so far, but declaring that something \u201dreminds me of an episode of Black Mirror\u201d still tends to elicit knowing smiles and nods \u2014 a response that\u2019s become even more common since Netflix began streaming the British series back in 2014. Black Mirror first aired in 2011, on the UK\u2019s Channel 4, with a promise that every episode would feature a new story and new characters, in the style of The Twilight Zone.",
        "On Wednesday night, Tesla, the electric car company helmed by Elon Musk, announced that all new cars in production would be equipped with \u201cthe hardware needed for full capability. \u201d Now, this does not mean the cars will be able to drive themselves. Not yet, at least. What it means is that every new Tesla car produced \u2014 including the Model S, Model X, and forthcoming Model 3 \u2014 will come equipped with $8, 000 worth of sensors, cameras, and computers in the hopes that one day, Tesla will perfect the software that allows cars to drive themselves.",
        "In a 1969 speech, Richard Nixon directly addressed the \u201csilent majority\u201d of Americans who he hoped would support his middle path policy on Vietnam. The speech itself, if you read it, is rather banal and unremarkable, but the turn of phrase came to be a powerful icon of the politics of the era. At a time when American society seemed in many ways to be pulling apart, Nixon argued for stability.",
        "The worst presidential election in modern American history is careening toward an outcome that, with each passing hour, seems more and more inevitable. But not because it is rigged. Over the past 15 years, as a lawyer practicing campaign finance and election law, I have represented Republican candidates and conservative organizations in the political process, including in multiple close elections, recounts, and election law disputes.",
        "The 2016 election is a bizarre political circus. So it\u2019s fitting, in a way, that one of Donald Trump\u2019s invited guests for the third and last presidential debate is Malik Obama \u2014 President Obama\u2019s . Ostensibly, Malik Obama is attending the debate simply because he supports Donald Trump. He endorsed Trump back in July, and promised that he\u2019d return to the US from Kenya to vote for him in November.",
        "Three weeks before Election Day, a major party presidential candidate is openly questioning the legitimacy of the results, saying there\u2019s a conspiracy to steal the election from him. And it\u2019s not clear he or his supporters will go gently. One member of Republican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle, Roger Stone, has \u201cpredicted\u201d (which is to say, encouraged) \u201cwidespread civil disobedience\u201d if Trump loses the election \u2014 a situation that he once described, somewhat nonsensically, as a \u201cbloodbath\u201d without violence.",
        "This is the end: The third and final presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is here. The two candidates will face off at 9 pm ET on Wednesday, October 19, at the University of Nevada Las Vegas for 90 minutes \u2014 no commercial breaks \u2014 in a debate moderated by Fox News anchor Chris Wallace. The debate will cover debt and entitlements, immigration, the economy, the Supreme Court, foreign hot spots, and \u201dfitness to be president\u201d \u2014 topics selected by Wallace.",
        "Both major party candidates in this election are unusually unpopular. Young people in particular are unenthusiastic about Trump and Clinton \u2014 polling earlier in the election suggested that somewhere between 15 and 44 percent of millennials were planning to vote for a candidate. We wanted to hear from these young voters who are dissatisfied with both Trump and Clinton and have decided to vote third party. Here is a explaining why he\u2019s voting for the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein. You can also check out our story from a Libertarian voter.",

Here is a explaining why she\u2019s voting for Libertarian Gary Johnson. See also our story from a Green Party voter. I grew up in a house with lots of guns.",
        "Both Donald and Melania Trump have made some cringeworthy attempts to discredit People magazine reporter Natasha Stoynoff, who says Donald Trump pushed her up against a wall and forcibly kissed her while she was profiling him and a Melania in late 2005. Donald brushed off Stoynoff\u2019s claims by strongly suggesting that she wasn\u2019t attractive enough to warrant his advances. \u201cLook at her,\u201d Trump said during a speech. \u201cLook at her words. You tell me what you think. I don\u2019t think so.",
        "On October 7, Vox\u2019s The Big Idea published two pieces on the future of Obamacare \u2014 one that took a pessimistic view (by Republican consultant Avik Roy) and one with a more optimistic perspective (by Bob Kocher and Ezekiel Emanuel, who worked in the Obama White House on health care reform). Below, Roy responds to the article by Kocher and Emanuel. See Kocher and Emanuel\u2019s response to Roy\u2019s article here. Bob Kocher and Ezekiel Emanuel argue that it\u2019s \u201dmisleading\u201d to raise concerns about the fact that individual market health insurance premiums have nearly doubled under the Affordable Care Act.",
        "Hillary Clinton told a joke. Speaking to a roomful of Goldman Sachs bankers in June 2013, Clinton said that Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein could leave the Wall Street firm that\u2019s made him a billionaire to start a soup kitchen: This exchange was written down by Clinton\u2019s aides as they gathered information on what parts of her paid Wall Street speeches could prove damaging should they leak to the press. Her team filed it under the heading, \u201dAWKWARD.\u201d This \u201dAWKWARD\u201d quote and hundreds of other previously hidden nuggets about Clinton have spilled out into public view recently.",
        "The third and final presidential debate has ended, and it can now be said: Hillary Clinton crushed Donald Trump in the most effective series of debate performances in modern political history. The polling tells the story. As Nate Silver notes, on the eve of the first presidential debate, Clinton led by 1. 5 points. Before the second, she was up by 5. 6 points. Before the third, she was winning by 7. 1 points.",
        "There was only one moment that really mattered during the final presidential debate: Donald Trump said that he might not accept the results of the November election. It wasn\u2019t Trump\u2019s first assault on democracy, or on the legitimacy of his opponent. Trump has often been a little too comfortable with the idea of using violence to get his way, and a little too willing to egg on his followers\u2019 worst instincts. But the last weeks of the campaign, as his chances fade, have made Trump more desperate, less careful, and more dangerous.",
        "It\u2019s all finally over. The final debate of the 2016 presidential election is behind us, the last event of its kind after two other general election debates, nine Democratic primary debates, and 12 Republican primary debates. More than a year after Donald Trump began the election season in earnest by calling Rosie O\u2019Donnell a fat pig on Fox News, the nights of chaotic sparring and inchoate yelling from presidential candidates have come to an end. The final debate was more raw and pugilistic than any of its predecessors, with Clinton particularly at her most animated to date.",
        "About an hour into last night\u2019s third and final presidential debate, during what was supposed to be a discussion on the economy, Donald Trump turned to Hillary Clinton and had this to say: In turn, Clinton dished out a brutal, comparison of her past 30 years with Trump\u2019s past 30 years. Her response speaks to a massive preparation gap that has shown up in all three debates. Clinton seemed poised and ready for this exact type of question.",
        "Calling Hillary Clinton a \u201cnasty woman\u201d may have been the best thing Donald Trump has ever done for her campaign. Trump has spent most of the election reminding us just how difficult it can be for a woman to run for president in a world still steeped in patriarchy. First there was that debate when Trump manterrupted Clinton three times more than she interrupted him. And then we kicked things up a notch, when we all watched him justify bragging about sexual assault.",
        "The scariest moment of Wednesday\u2019s final presidential debate was when Donald Trump refused to say whether he would concede if he lost the election, treating a crucial pillar of American democracy like a reality TV twist to be manipulated. But the thing was that much of the debate felt, well, normal. Trump has so radically readjusted our expectations for presidential candidates that a debate in which a major candidate threatens democratic traditions, blatantly insults his opponent, and is asked about a history of sexual assault could seem, at times, ."
