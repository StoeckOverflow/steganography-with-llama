        "It finally happened. After three straight debates without a single moderator asking about climate change, Fox News\u2019s Chris Wallace decided to focus the final presidential showdown on a issue that would greatly affect future generations. He wasn\u2019t going to let Trump or Clinton avoid the topic, either. He pulled out facts and figures and demanded to know why the two candidates were ignoring the problem. Wait, sorry, I\u2019m just kidding. Wallace didn\u2019t ask about climate change at all. He wanted to talk about the national debt. The national debt is an odd, recurring fixation in Washington.",
        "It\u2019s over. There will be no more presidential debates between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. (Hopefully.) The final debate looked, at first, like it could have been pretty normal. At the start, there were some Trumpy moments \u2014 but for the most part, it appeared like both candidates, thanks to Trump\u2019s slightly better behavior, were going to mostly stick to the issues. Then Trump happened. By the end of the debate, Trump had insulted Latino immigrants in Spanish, continued to say that he would not concede the election if he lost, and called Clinton \u201csuch a nasty woman.",
        "It\u2019s extraordinary that Chris Wallace had to ask this question of Donald Trump during a presidential debate: If he loses, will he accept the result of the election? But what is even more stunning was Trump\u2019s response: You\u2019ll just have to wait and see. \u201cI will look at it at the time,\u201d Trump said. He listed off his litany of complaints about the election. The media is biased. There are \u201cmillions of people registered to vote that shouldn\u2019t be registered to vote,\u201d he said, distorting a Pew Research Center report that was about voter registration systems rather than fraud.",
        "\u201cIt feels in a lot of ways like America is having a nervous breakdown,\u201d says the Atlantic\u2019s Molly Ball, one of the sharpest political reporters in the business, on a recent episode of The Ezra Klein Show. (You can stream the episode here or subscribe to the show on iTunes.) \u201cThese candidates are epiphenomenon of a bigger national thing that is happening. \u201d In a conversation this September, Ball and I tried to make sense of the discontent that appears to be roiling the American electorate.",
        "Since this morning, many internet users have had trouble reaching dozens of major websites, including Twitter, Reddit, Spotify, and CNN. The culprit seems to be an attack on the domain name system, or DNS, a part of infrastructure that plays a crucial role online. DNS acts as the internet\u2019s directory service. It keeps track of who owns websites like Google. com and Vox. com and gives your computer the IP address it needs to connect with them directly. This morning, someone \u2014 it\u2019s not clear who \u2014 began flooding a popular DNS provider, called Dyn, with fake traffic.",
        "At the final presidential debate, Donald Trump said doctors do abortions in the \u201cninth month\u201d of pregnancy, that they \u201crip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month, on the final day. And that\u2019s not acceptable. \u201d I\u2019m a doctor who was trained to do abortions. I did them for five years in residency and for 10 years in practice and I have no idea what Trump is talking about. I have even practiced in states with no gestational age limit for abortions.",
        "Human papillomavirus \u2014 also known as HPV \u2014 can be a sly little invader. When it infects us, the tiny, virus burrows into the skin and mucous membranes and can cause genital warts and cancer. For many, the infection clears up on its own. But in the cases where it persists, the virus can live in the body for years, silently spread to other people through unprotected sex, and cause cancer in the cervix, throat, or anus.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s campaign seems to be going down in flames \u2014 but it\u2019s still far from clear how much that will help Democratic candidates in their effort to retake the Senate. Democrats would need a net gain of four seats to retake the chamber if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency. And right now, they\u2019re already likely to win two seats, with five more looking like . Then there is just one Democratic seat that appears to be up for grabs.",
        "On Thursday night, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump spoke at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York City. It\u2019s an annual charity event with political and media figures that\u2019s usually lighthearted and fun \u2014 weeks before the last presidential election, Mitt Romney and Barack Obama put in funny, performances there. This \u2026 was not that. Donald Trump spoke first, and his speech was deeply strange. He began with a riff that, delivered properly, could have come off as lighthearted \u2014 but, with his actual delivery, sounded embittered and angry.",
        "The Rocky Horror Picture Show has long been a example of how to pervert traditions and expectations with a knowing grin (and splashy musical numbers, besides). From its debut on a tiny London stage in 1973 to its subsequent 1975 film adaptation starring Susan Sarandon and Tim Curry, the movie\u2019s ensuing cult classic status, and the thousands of midnight screenings that are still held worldwide each year, the horror comedy has always been a legendary celebration of camp and deviant pleasure.",
        "A specter is haunting Speaker Paul Ryan \u2014 the specter of Bernie Sanders controlling the Senate budget committee. Speaking at an event with College Republicans in Wisconsin earlier this week, Ryan warned that letting the Senate slip back into Democratic hands might give Vermont\u2019s democratic socialist one of the most powerful positions for shaping the federal budget. \u201cIf we lose the Senate, do you know who becomes chairman of the Senate budget committee? ,\u201d Ryan said, according to the Nation. \u201cA guy named Bernie Sanders. Ever heard of him?",
        "The Handmaiden is a nearly flawless movie. Every frame, every movement of the camera, every performance feels perfectly calibrated for maximum effect. Rating 5 It\u2019s also a relentlessly entertaining movie. And that might not be your first thought when I talk about a perfect movie, or even a movie. For whatever reason, too many American moviegoers think of these sorts of films as austere tales of gentle longing or what have you. And, yeah, there are some (great!) films like that. But The Handmaiden is the furthest thing you could get from an austere tale of gentle longing.",
        "Remember Billy Bush, the television host who egged on Donald Trump in the leaked 2005 Access Hollywood tape and then lost his gig with NBC\u2019s Today when the tape erupted into the 2016 presidential campaign? Turns out he\u2019s been reflecting on the episode, as we learned this week in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter: \u201cLooking back upon what was said on that bus, I wish I had changed the topic,\u201d he said. \u201c[Trump] liked TV and competition. I could\u2019ve said, \u2018Can you believe the ratings on whatever?\u2019 But I didn\u2019t have the strength of character to do it.",
        "Doctor Strange, Marvel\u2019s latest journey into its cinematic universe, exemplifies both the best and the worst of the comic book movie studio. On the one hand, the movie is visually inventive, peppered with solid jokes, and beautifully acted. On the other hand, the story\u2019s a bit of a mess, with a script that\u2019s roughly exposition and a main character arc that doesn\u2019t make a lick of sense. But this is still a movie people are probably going to want to see \u2014 especially Marvel .",
        "When word leaked on Friday that AT&T, the wireless carrier that also owns Direct TV and the smallish wireline fiber optic service, was preparing to purchase Time Warner, shares of the telecom utility immediately plummeted and those of the media conglomerate soared. In subsequent days, analysts have put forward various versions of the story from insiders in both companies as to why this is a good idea. But it\u2019s worth taking that initial market reaction seriously. The combined company, if it comes together, may well prove to be a and profitable conglomerate.",
        "Obamacare premiums are on track to rise faster than ever before in 2017. The Obama administration released data Monday showing that premiums for midlevel plans will rise, on average, 22 percent between 2016 and 2017. Yes, that is a huge increase. Last year premiums went up by 7. 5 percent. Premiums are rising on the Obamacare marketplaces largely because the people who signed up for coverage were sicker than the insurance companies expected. This led some health insurers (like Aetna and UnitedHealth) to leave the marketplace.",
        "The American people are pissed. They are outraged at an economy that works for Wall Street but not for them. They are furious at a foreign trade regime that has devastated manufacturing. They are skeptical of immigration from Mexico, either as an unfortunate xenophobic consequence of economic despair (if you\u2019re on the left) or an understandable response to social change that had gone unchallenged by the major parties before the rise of Donald Trump (if you\u2019re on the right). This is the election that has been embraced by those across the ideological spectrum.",
        "It seems like the United States economy is enjoying more innovation than ever before. At the same time, statistics show the economy suffering from its slowest growth in decades. Analysts often try to resolve this by arguing either that conventional statistics aren\u2019t properly measuring the value of innovation or else that the apparent in innovation is actually an illusion and progress is slowing down. Another possibility is that things are exactly as they seem: Rapid technological innovation is real, and so is slow economic growth. In fact, in a sense the innovation is causing the slow growth.",
        "\u201dTom Hanks plays a Donald Trump supporter\u201d could\u2019ve yielded some obvious (read: lazy) jokes when he hosted Saturday Night Live on October 22. Instead, the show made him play Black Jeopardy \u2014 and found a whole new way to talk about the nuances of this exhausting presidential election cycle. The Black Jeopardy sketch has been recurring since 2014, usually throwing but ultimately clueless white people into a game that caters to its black contestants. Past categories have included \u201dThey Out Here Saying,\u201d \u201dIf It\u2019s Sunday,\u201d and \u201dBruh.",
        "In case you hadn\u2019t noticed, Donald Trump lies. A lot. He\u2019s lied about his own questioning of President Obama\u2019s birthplace. He\u2019s lied about tweeting that climate change is a hoax planted by China. He\u2019s lied about how he\u2019s voiced support for the Iraq War. Trump is hardly the only politician who gets caught in lies, even if he\u2019s more practiced and prolific than most. We have a much more political discourse today than we used to, as journalist and author Lucas Graves told my colleague Tara Golshan this summer.",
        "Hillary Clinton hasn\u2019t won the election yet, but she probably will. And if she does, her transition will swiftly face a fundamental question with profound consequences for all the other choices she makes as she builds out her team: What happens to the Cabinet and that\u2019s already in place? Officially, of course, everyone who serves at the pleasure of the president is prepared to leave when he does.",
        "Hillary Clinton found herself in a dilemma as she moved to launch her presidential run while also aiding her husband\u2019s philanthropy \u2014 and her team knew it. Sometime before announcing her candidacy, Clinton had agreed to go to a Clinton Global Initiative fundraiser in Morocco planned for May 2015. The king of Morocco had personally pledged to give $12 million with the understanding she\u2019d attend, according to emails released last week by WikiLeaks. But then there was the awkward fact that Clinton would be running for president by then.",
        "For Iceland, renewable energy is easy. Almost annoyingly so. The island nation sits right atop two tectonic plates slowly pulling apart, drawing up magma from below. That rift is the source of Iceland\u2019s active volcanoes, which frequently belch lava and ash into the sky. But it also has a benefit: The country can easily tap geothermal heat and steam beneath the surface to generate electrical power and heat \u2014 all without any carbon dioxide emissions. Much of Iceland\u2019s electricity comes from hydropower, but most of its heating comes from geothermal.",
        "\u201cThe Day Will Come When You Won\u2019t Be,\u201d the season seven premiere of The Walking Dead, is dumb. No, that doesn\u2019t go far enough. It\u2019s dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb. It\u2019s stupid. It\u2019s downright appalling, is what it is. I\u2019ve had a lot of issues with The Walking Dead of late \u2014 especially with that genuinely terrible season six finale \u2014 but I probably still would have called myself, in general, a \u201cfan\u201d of the show until tonight. Being a fan sometimes means rolling your eyes at something stupid but powering through.",
        "Artificial intelligence has become the pet anxiety of luminaries like Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Stephen Hawking. They have all expressed concerns about our Promethean quest to develop machine intelligence, and those concerns seem to be spreading every day. But there\u2019s another dimension of technological change that ought to worry us every bit as much as AI, if not more so. Bioengineering has already allowed human beings to take control of their own evolution.",
        "Sexual assault is a major issue in the United States. Many private and government agencies \u2014 the FBI, the CDC, the US Department of Justice, and organizations like RAINN \u2014 round up statistics on rape and sexual assault, but the estimates are wide ranging: some place the figure as high as 1. 9 million cases per year, and others as low as 90, 185. Moreover, studies have shown that only about of these crimes are reported to authorities, making concrete figures hard to pin down.",
        "Update: The soda industry tried to kill Philadelphia\u2019s soda tax with a lawsuit against the city, alleging the tax amounted to double taxation and that it would duplicate the sales tax in the city. A judge just dismissed the suit, filed by the American Beverage Association, and the city\u2019s soda tax will proceed as planed. This could set a precedent for other lawsuits filed by the industry to try and block soda taxes.",
        "When the tape was released earlier this month of Donald Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women, I felt hopeful about politics for the first time in months. It wasn\u2019t that I took pleasure in the fact that Trump was indeed as terrible as I thought he was. I was hopeful because to me the tape was clear, incontrovertible evidence of his unfitness for office, evidence that even the most ardent leaders on the religious right would be unable to ignore. As a conservative evangelical, the past year has been emotionally and spiritually draining.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, Sunday, was billed as a sober, look at his first 100 days in office. But the first thing he promised to do after being elected was to sue the women who have accused him of sexual assault. \u201cAll of these liars will be sued after the election is over,\u201d Trump promised. He continued to attack them: \u201cEvery woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign,\u201d he said. And he implied that Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign had paid them for their stories.",
        "David Axelrod\u2019s podcast conversation with Tim Kaine is worth listening to in full, but the part that struck me was Kaine\u2019s riff on what it would mean to be the first man to serve as vice president to a woman president. Kaine argues that that, too, is a historic and important first, and he feels the weight of being an example to others: When Hillary asked me to be her running mate, what flashed through my mind was I\u2019ve been in politics for 22 years; this is my ninth race."
