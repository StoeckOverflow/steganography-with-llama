        "For as long as I\u2019ve covered Obamacare, I\u2019ve always found Caroline Pearson to be an exceptionally smart and honest observer of the law. Pearson is a senior vice president at the research firm Avalere Health, and I called her up Tuesday morning to talk about Obamacare\u2019s spiking premiums. Pearson doesn\u2019t think rate hikes are Obamacare\u2019s new normal \u2014 but she does see other challenges on the horizon that will make it difficult for the marketplaces to grow. \u201cThe dramatic premium increase should be a correction, Pearson says. \u201cPlans have been underpriced.",
        "The role of sex and gender in this election extends beyond Donald Trump\u2019s personal history and the media\u2019s excessive scrutiny of Hillary Clinton\u2019s voice. Trump\u2019s populism reflects anxieties over the changing role of women and men in society against a backdrop of harrowing economic crisis and demographic change that will soon make the United States a country. As Stephanie Coontz argues, the upheavals are all interrelated. Economic precarity promotes the scapegoating of women and people of color while the divergent fortunes of poor and affluent families foster distrust and anger over the rising stature of women.",
        "The French government has officially begun dismantling the infamous \u201cJungle\u201d migrant camp in the French city of Calais, which houses roughly 6, 000 people and has been a potent symbol of Europe\u2019s refugee crisis. About 2, 000 of the camp\u2019s residents, most of whom are from Africa and Afghanistan, left on buses voluntarily on Monday. Hundreds more have been following them out of the camp on Tuesday, the second full day of the operation. They are being taken to over 400 \u201creception centers\u201d \u2014 many of which are abandoned barracks, hospitals, and hotels \u2014 located throughout France.",
        "Amanda Glaze is a professor of science education at Georgia Southern University. Before that she spent roughly a decade teaching in Georgia and Alabama. She has spent her entire teaching career in the South. Earlier this year, she produced a video for sciencefriday. com about the challenges she\u2019s encountered as a science educator. Teaching science, evolution in particular, can be a thankless job in this part of the country. In some communities, you\u2019re colliding with a culture and a worldview that is both central to the identity of people and deeply threatened by scientific materialism.",
        "In its early years, Twitter refused to address harassment concerns on free speech grounds. But the company changed its tune a few years ago, and now it insists it\u2019s doing everything it can to fight online harassment. But as many using the platform know, little has come of it and enforcement of new policies had been terribly inconsistent. The extreme levels of harassment on the site and the inconsistencies in policy enforcement gained national attention this July, when Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones threatened to leave Twitter after facing a barrage of racist and sexist tweets.",
        "trucks are here. Otto, a truck startup that Uber acquired this summer, shipped a truckload of beer across Colorado. According to Otto\u2019s blog post on the trip, \u201cour professional driver was out of the driver\u2019s seat for the entire journey down monitoring the system from the sleeper berth in the back. \u201d But this doesn\u2019t mean the nation\u2019s truck drivers need to start working on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. Technology like this may eventually displace human truck drivers, but the tech is several years away from causing mass unemployment. The key reason is that Otto\u2019s technology is initially limited to highways.",
        "Hillary Clinton has dramatically reversed her struggles with youth voters and is now on track to do about as well with them as Barack Obama did in 2012 \u2014 a result that seemed inconceivable just a few weeks ago. Through most of this fall, it looked like Clinton was letting young voters slip away from the Democratic coalition. She was running way behind Obama among this voting bloc, by as many as 25 points. Some polls had her down to the low 40s among those under 30, setting off a flurry of liberal panic about millennials\u2019 \u201c revolution.",
        "On the large majority of policy issues, Donald Trump has a more conservative policy position than the people who intend to vote for him. But there\u2019s one issue where Trump and his supporters align exactly: His proposal to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the US. But for virtually every other issue \u2014 from taxes to campaign finance to climate change \u2014 Trump holds a more conservative stance. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is ideologically similar to her supporters, although there are interesting contrasts when it\u2019s broken it down .",
        "For months now, leaders have been lining up behind the least likely hero our country has ever seen. Donald Trump may not have been their first choice. But as we draw near to the end of this long and sordid campaign, they are standing behind and beside the Republican nominee for president, explaining away his misogyny and racism for the promise of Supreme Court justices. But the truth is there has never been a case for voting for Donald Trump.",
        "About one year ago, Bernie Sanders memorably told Hillary Clinton during a primary debate that the American people were \u201csick and tired of hearing about your damn emails. \u201d It appears he still thinks they are. In an interview with the Washington Post published on Monday, Sanders downplayed talk that the Clinton campaign had disrespected the Vermont senator in internal emails hacked by WikiLeaks. (Some of the emails showed Clinton allies cursing at Sanders endorsers and referring to his proposals as emerging from a \u201cleftie alternative universe.",
        "The Syrian city of Aleppo has come up again and again in the US presidential campaign \u2014 because at least two candidates have no idea what to say about it. But understanding what\u2019s happening in Aleppo right now is critical to understanding the situation in Syria. If you watch the above video and read the below text, you can consider yourself better informed than Gary Johnson and Donald Trump. Aleppo is a city located in Northwest Syria near the Turkish border. It\u2019s the capital of the eponymous Aleppo province and was the country\u2019s most populated city before the war.",
        "The first thing Melinda Wedding thinks about when she wakes at 6:15 am is checking her daughter Carson\u2019s blood sugar to see if she needs another dose of insulin. \u201dType 1 diabetes is constant,\u201d Wedding told me. \u201dThere\u2019s no downtime.\u201d Throughout the day she might look at her watch, which gives her a reading of her daughter\u2019s blood sugar, up to 100 times. With that data comes hundreds of decisions about when Carson should eat and how to use her insulin pump. Every night, Wedding wakes up two or three times to check on her daughter\u2019s blood levels again.",
        "Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine told Meet The Press on Sunday that \u201cless concentration is generally helpful, especially in media,\u201d suggesting a skeptical view of AT&T\u2019s proposed takeover of Time Warner. And that may have been the best political news the merger got this weekend. Donald Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, Peter Navarro, put out a long statement condemning the proposed deal, explaining that \u201cthe very corporations that have gained from shipping America\u2019s factories and jobs offshore are the very same media conglomerates now pushing Hillary Clinton\u2019s agenda.",
        "Tesla has surprised everyone by turning a small profit for the first time in years. Elon Musk\u2019s electric car company announced it had earned $22 million in the third quarter of 2016 \u2014 at a time when investors were bracing for a loss. The news is huge for Tesla, which had been struggling to keep Wall Street happy as it raises billions in new capital for a major expansion. Up until this point, Tesla has been primarily a niche producer of luxury cars.",
        "WASHINGTON \u2014 Was Donald Trump\u2019s stop in Washington, DC, to open his new hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue a campaign event? It\u2019s hard to say \u2014 because it\u2019s hard to say if Trump is even still running for president. Less than two weeks before Election Day, lagging Hillary Clinton in the polls, Trump is more determined to squeeze every last ounce of publicity from his presidential run than he is to get voters to the polls. He\u2019s thinking past Election Day, and the future he\u2019s envisioning isn\u2019t in the Oval Office.",
        "Three years ago, health economists believed Obamacare\u2019s marketplaces would grow to replace much of America\u2019s fractured, complex health insurance system. Predictions for the insurance system\u2019s collapse ran rampant. The question around companies shifting workers to the new public marketplaces was often framed as not if but when. University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Zeke Emanuel pegged it at 2025. MIT\u2019s Jonathan Gruber estimated 2050. These days, you don\u2019t hear those predictions anymore. Speculation, instead, focuses on whether the marketplaces will survive at all. Major health insurers Aetna and UnitedHealth soured on the law over the summer, sharply reducing participation in the marketplaces.",
        "We heard virtually nothing about climate change in the presidential debates this year. The moderators avoided the topic like an ancient Egyptian curse, and Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton rarely delved into energy policy. So for those interested in the issue, might I suggest an alternative? On Tuesday, the University of Richmond School of Law hosted a debate between the two campaigns\u2019 energy advisers. On Team Clinton: Trevor Houser, an analyst at the Rhodium Group. On Team Trump: Rep. Kevin Cramer ( ).",
        "Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly had a heated exchange with Trump supporter and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich on Tuesday about Trump\u2019s flagging poll numbers, and about the women who have accused Trump of sexually assaulting them. When Kelly suggested the two things were related, Gingrich complained that the media devoted more coverage to the Trump tapes than to controversy over Hillary Clinton\u2019s speeches. And when Kelly argued that it would be a big news story \u201dif Trump is a sexual predator,\u201d Gingrich completely lost it.",
        "A while back, hackers linked to the Russian government stole a cache of emails from Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta and furnished them to WikiLeaks. One of those emails has generated a lot of interest in conservative circles because \u2014 conservatives say \u2014 it shows that polls are being systematically biased in Clinton\u2019s favor. In the email, Thomas Matzzie, a Democratic operative, asked advisers at a progressive group called the Atlas Project to \u201crecommend oversamples for our polling.",
        "It\u2019s a miracle that Tim remembers to breathe. Tim didn\u2019t understand the need for vowels, as I watched him try to figure out a simple word problem. He tried to pry chess pieces off a chessboard, even after he realized they were glued down. He also attempted to speak to a dead man. My friends and I spent close to an hour with Tim and one of his friends, solving puzzles, crawling through an air shaft, working on math problems I hadn\u2019t seen since high school.",
        "Larry Levitt has been thinking about and analyzing the Affordable Care Act and its insurance marketplaces since before the ACA was law. So I reached out to him to make sense of the new data showing premiums will rise by an astonishing 22 percent next year. Levitt argues, convincingly, that some of the most important people to watch are those who aren\u2019t even using the Obamacare marketplace. They\u2019re the 7 million people who buy their own coverage outside of the federal website, perhaps directly from their preferred insurer or through a local broker.",
        "There\u2019s a question often asked in gun control debates: If gun control works, why do cities and states with strict restrictions on firearms still have so much gun violence? A new report from the New York State Office of the Attorney General offers an answer: The firearms used in that violence tend to come from other places that don\u2019t have strict gun laws. The report, released this week, looked at the guns recovered from crime scenes in the state.",
        "Donald Trump has a simple answer for people who look at his flagging poll numbers and pronounce him toast: Brexit. Trump told rallygoers that the results on Election Day will \u201cbe like Brexit times five. \u201d Newt Gingrich says Trump\u2019s odds of winning remain \u201cvery, very good\u201d because \u201cjust as with the Brexit vote in Britain,\u201d there are secret Trump supporters out there who don\u2019t want to tell pollsters they are voting for him. Matthew Goodwin at Politico exhorted liberals on October 16 to \u201clearn the lesson of Brexit\u201d and not underestimate Trump\u2019s chances of winning.",
        "This Tuesday, November 8, tens of millions of Americans will embark on the same ritual they have followed for years or decades: Every first Tuesday after the first Monday of November, they vote. But why is Election Day on this specific Tuesday in November? As the Federal Election Commission previously explained, this has to do with very specific considerations that Congress had in mind back in 1845 when it set a standardized voting day: For much of our history, America was a predominantly agrarian society.",
        "Voting is one of the most important acts of citizenship we perform, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s always a simple process. As Americans flood into their polling places today there are plenty of things that can stand between their best, most patriotic intentions and the ballot box. During this campaign, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has claimed the election is somehow \u201crigged. \u201d In fact, many of his supporters are answering his call to monitor polling places to ensure the election isn\u2019t \u201cstolen.",
        "Earlier this week, Sen. Ron Wyden and Rep Earl Blumenauer, both Democrats from Oregon, introduced a bill that would expand their state\u2019s system to the entire country. It\u2019s not a new notion. Wyden has been pushing versions of the bill since 2010. But given the events of the past year \u2014 Trump\u2019s narrow victory, accusations of voter fraud, laws in various states \u2014 it is more relevant than ever. Its Senate list has grown to 19 and now includes leftie stalwarts like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.",
        "Donald Trump lies. It\u2019s what he does. He lies nonchalantly. He lies without apparent reason or remorse. And he lies all the time. In September, Daniel Dale, a reporter for the Toronto Star, started posting a list on Twitter of all the provably false statements he hears from Trump on the campaign trail each day. Over 25 days (starting on September 15 and ending on October 24, with some days off for Dale in between) Trump lied on at least 378 occasions.",
        "Life doesn\u2019t always have a happy ending. For the millions of Afghans who have suffered through more than four decades of war in their country, happy endings are rarer still. The story of Sharbat Gula, the young Afghan refugee whose stunning green eyes and unforgiving gaze glared out at readers from the cover of the June 1985 issue of National Geographic, is a tragic case in point.",
        "Early voting numbers are rolling in, and campaigns are claiming their early voting victories. Clinton looks like she is up in Virginia and North Carolina \u2014 on track to have higher numbers than President Barack Obama did in 2012. Iowa and Ohio look better for Donald Trump than they did for Mitt Romney, and voting registration has evened out between parties in Florida, a state where absentee voting has typically swayed Republicans.",
        "Until Thursday, the MacBook Pro had not been mentioned on an Apple event stage in more than a year. But on October 27 \u2014 on the 25th anniversary of Apple\u2019s first notebook laptop \u2014 Apple CEO Tim Cook announced the latest, long awaited, upgrade to the MacBook Pro. \u201cFor 25 years we have been defining and redefining what a notebook is and what a notebook can do, and today and we are going to do it again,\u201d Cook said."
