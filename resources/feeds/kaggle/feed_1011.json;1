        "Donald Trump hates losing. And right now he looks likely to lose the election. So how will he react if he does? One possibility is that he won\u2019t concede at all \u2014 after all, he\u2019s only promised to accept the results of the election \u201cif I win. \u201d He\u2019s promised he will \u201clook at it at the time\u201d and \u201ckeep you in suspense. \u201d He\u2019s pointed out that he reserves his \u201cright to contend or file a legal challenge, in the case of a questionable result. \u201d Still, it\u2019s possible that his threats are just about keeping up suspense.",
        "When Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton campaigned together for the first time, Obama showered Clinton with praise as a \u201cfriend,\u201d a \u201cpolicy wonk,\u201d and \u201cmy girl. \u201d She said she is \u201cinspired\u201d by Clinton because she has \u201clived a life grounded in service and sacrifice. \u201d But one of the most compelling moments of Obama\u2019s speech came when she pushed back against Donald Trump\u2019s \u201crigged election\u201d talk. She fiercely defended the idea that voting matters, and reminded listeners of the sacrifices that have come with securing the right to vote for all Americans.",
        "Before the Chicago Cubs won the World Series last year, their last championship appearance was in 1945 \u2014 and their Game 1 starting lineup looked like this: Then in 1947 Jackie Robinson broke the Major League Baseball color barrier, and and Latino players trickled into the league. Now about 40 percent of players are nonwhite. So this is what the Cubs starting lineup looked like for Game 1 of the 2016 World Series: On the surface, it looks like baseball has become far more diverse \u2014 and by many measures, it really has.",
        "The deaths of two characters in The Walking Dead\u2019s season seven premiere, \u201dThe Day Will Come When You Won\u2019t Be,\u201d have prompted even more of a critical pushback against the show than usual \u2014 which is saying something. Vulture\u2019s Matt Zoller Seitz offered a long disquisition on the emptiness of the show\u2019s violence. Hitfix\u2019s Donna Dickens swore off the show, as did the recapping crew at Vox\u2019s sister site the Verge. The A. V. Club\u2019s Zack Handlen called the premiere a new low for the show. Your humble reporter called the episode \u201ddumb\u201d about 600 times.",
        "I recently saw a Facebook post going around that encouraged girls to be loud. Telling them not to laugh at boys\u2019 jokes if they\u2019re not funny. To speak up. To not apologize. To not smile upon request. To take up space. To be a \u201cbadass woman. \u201d Theses types of inspirational messages have been dominating my timeline for months now, obviously because we\u2019re living a nightmare where sexism personified is running for president against the major party female nominee. It feels like a perfectly constructed joke.",
        "You probably know who John Roselius is. He\u2019s the actor who in the 1980s and \u201990s told millions of Americans in an advertisement that \u201cthis is your brain on drugs\u201d while frying an egg on a pan. The ad has become a bit of a cultural phenomenon \u2014 exemplifying what many people see as the ridiculous hyperbole behind the federal government\u2019s war on drugs and its campaigns. Well, it turns out that Roselius himself is not too happy with the ad\u2019s legacy.",
        "Former Republican member of Congress and conservative commentator Joe Walsh said on Twitter Wednesday that if Donald Trump loses, \u201cI\u2019m grabbing my musket. \u201d On November 8th, I\u2019m voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I\u2019m grabbing my musket. You in? \u2014 Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 On the one hand, he didn\u2019t say \u201cgun,\u201d he said \u201cmuskets\u201d \u2014 a term so antiquated and bizarre that it was almost funny, and a lot of commentators were quick to make jokes at Walsh\u2019s expense.",
        "The FBI is not through investigating Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server. Though Clinton was cleared of criminal charges by the FBI in July, Director James Comey sent a letter to members of Congress on Friday that it has come across new emails in \u201can unrelated case,\u201d and that the bureau will review them \u201cto determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.",
        "The FBI shocked the political world on Friday by announcing that newly discovered emails have caused the bureau to renew its inquiry into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server. The Clinton campaign has for months thought the worst of the email server controversy was over. In July, to their great relief, FBI Director James Comey said that Clinton would not face criminal charges for sending emails over a private server while secretary of state. But whatever new emails authorities have found are apparently enough to trigger a second look at whether she broke the law.",
        "Vine, Twitter\u2019s unorthodox video app, is shutting down. Without giving a specific timeline, the company stated on Thursday that sometime \u201cin the coming months\u201d it will be discontinuing its video uploader but preserving, at least for now, the millions of videos that already exist on the website. While this news might come as a shock to Vine\u2019s loyal fans, industry insiders probably could have seen it coming.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign was only four days old when a suggestion landed in the inbox of John Podesta, her campaign chair. It came from Brent Budowsky, a political columnist for the Hill. Budowsky suggested that Clinton should announce she wanted to get into a boxing ring with Carly Fiorina, then a Republican presidential candidate, for a charity event. Budowsky added a caveat \u2014 Clinton should only suggest to square off against Fiorina, he said, if she had \u201cthe daring and fiendish wit\u201d to pull it off.",
        "The Supreme Court will consider whether transgender students are legally entitled under federal law to use the public school bathroom that aligns with their gender identity, the court announced on Friday. The case involves Gavin Grimm, a trans boy who filed a lawsuit against the Gloucester County School Board in Virginia so he could use the boys\u2019 bathroom at his school.",
        "A disturbing video from a 2011 corporate speech shows Donald Trump sexually humiliating a woman in front of thousands of people and going in for what appears to be a nonconsensual kiss, the Huffington Post\u2019s Ryan Grim reports. The woman is Jennifer Hawkins, the 2004 Miss Universe winner from Australia. In the video, Trump calls Hawkins onstage to join him after telling the audience his philosophy on using revenge to succeed in business: \u201dGet even with people,\u201d he says. \u201dIf they screw you, screw them back 10 times as hard.",
        "If Hillary Clinton is elected this fall, it will mark an unusual third straight defeat in presidential elections for Republicans and a historically unprecedented loss of the popular vote in six elections out of seven. And while nobody is sure yet how Donald Trump\u2019s roiling of the party establishment will play out in future primaries, it\u2019s clear enough that the party is settling in on a consensus view of how elected officials should respond in the short term \u2014 by doing the same thing they\u2019ve been doing for the past eight years.",
        "Rep. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and her family have always served their country. Not only is Duckworth currently a US representative, but before that she fought in Iraq in the US Army, and her family has long served in the US military \u2014 all the way back to the American Revolution. With this record, Duckworth, a Democrat, on Tuesday officially managed to win the US Senate race in Illinois. But perhaps the most outstanding moment in this Senate race came when her Republican opponent, Sen. Mark Kirk, openly questioned her patriotism \u2014 seemingly because of her Asian heritage.",
        "Alex Jones, the radio host and media mogul, is more responsible than any other single person for the spread of \u201cPizzagate\u201d \u2014 the totally false theory that DC pizza joint Comet Ping Pong is a front for a child sex ring involving Hillary and Bill Clinton. In one YouTube video, on November 4, Jones said that \u201cHillary Clinton has personally murdered and chopped up and raped [children]. \u201d Over the weekend, a man entered Comet \u2014 a family restaurant that I\u2019ve taken my niece and nephew to several times \u2014 with a rifle and fired at least one shot.",
        "In November 1896, Popular Science reported on a \u201ccurious superstition held by young men. \u201d It\u2019s bonkers: If one places a snake\u2019s tongue upon the palm of his hand \u2014 beneath the glove \u2014 it will cause any girl, regardless of her previous indifference, to ardently return his passion if he [were able] to take her hand within his own. People have been indulging in weird superstitions throughout history. It used to be customary to tell honeybees when there was a (human) death in the family \u2026 \u201cOr they will die, or go away,\u201d the Encyclopedia of Superstitions explains.",
        "The verdict is completely absurd. Eight months after the nation watched an armed militia take over a wildlife refuge in Oregon to protest federal land ownership, a jury has come back and said that the militia members are \u201cnot guilty. \u201d This includes not guilty of a charge that describes what everyone knows these militants did, considering that they themselves doing it: conspiracy to prevent Bureau of Land Management and US Fish and Wildlife employees from doing their jobs at the wildlife refuge. Again, this is literally what they did.",
        "Depending on whom you ask, Halloween is about finding the best costumes, watching the scariest movies, or getting to indulge the weirdest parts of yourself. But the one aspect of the holiday that unites us all, no matter which parts of Halloween we gravitate toward \u2014 and even those repelled by its manic celebrations \u2014 is candy. That\u2019s kind of beautiful, really. But as any kid will tell you at the end of the night, as they sort their bounty into piles, not all candy is created equal.",
        "There was much hue and cry among climate hawks in 2015 when Pope Francis issued his \u201dLaudato Si,\u201d an impassioned, statement decrying humankind\u2019s ill treatment of the Earth. In particular, it framed global warming as a challenge to the religious conscience. Climate campaigners greeted the encyclical as a \u201d \u201d that would crack the conservative wall of denial. Surveys at the time showed that the pope\u2019s message did not, alas, do much to shift the views of American Catholics on climate change. But papal enthusiasts counseled patience. Give it time to sink in, they said. Look at little deeper.",
        "The Department of Justice arrested 20 people in the US Thursday in connection with an international phone scam \u2014 the one I wrote about last week, where an Indian call center worker would call Americans pretending to be the IRS. They would demand money, and threaten immediate jail time if the victim didn\u2019t pay. I could glean some details of how this scam worked by documenting my interaction with the callers. But the indictment reveals several insights into how these types of operations work.",
        "Citizens of the United States will soon celebrate Halloween \u2014 a holiday that melds American ambition, the country\u2019s unquenchable thirst for ephemeral humor, and the thrill of putting on a costume. And nothing is more American than taking something great and tarting it up. It\u2019s what we do to ice cream when we turn it into a flavor orgy featuring marshmallows, walnuts, and cookies that didn\u2019t try hard enough. It\u2019s what we did to the movie industry, which is now more than ever. It\u2019s what we do to cars and boats.",
        "On Friday, FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to several members of Congress, in which he said that new emails related to the Hillary Clinton email investigation had been discovered. The timing of Comey\u2019s letter \u2014 sent just 11 days before the presidential election \u2014 created a media and political firestorm, and seemed to pose the prospect of some sort of smoking gun deeply implicating Clinton that could swing the election.",
        "Every weekend, we pick a movie you can watch at home that dovetails with an event from the previous week. Old, new, blockbuster, arthouse: They\u2019re all fair game. What you can count on is a weekend watch that sheds new light on the week that was. The movie of the week for October 23 through 29 is Fido (2006) directed by Andrew Currie and available to digitally rent on Amazon or stream on Amazon Prime. I don\u2019t watch The Walking Dead, but I understand it premiered last weekend to a lot of yelling and upset.",
        "Look around: Chances are there is Halloween candy near you right now. If the candy is not in your home, your office, or your school, it\u2019s in a bowl at the dry cleaner\u2019s, the doctor\u2019s office, or the tire shop. We\u2019ve officially entered the long season of holidays. Make no mistake: After we drench ourselves in sugar this Halloween, we\u2019ll do it again on Christmas and Hanukkah, Valentine\u2019s Day, Passover, Easter, and in the weeks between these special days. The candy industry counts on us to celebrate with sugar for a huge portion of its annual sales.",
        "It\u2019s fall \u2014 the perfect time for a road trip. The roads aren\u2019t yet slippery with ice, the trees are awash in vibrant colors, and the weather is just nippy enough to require a jacket, but not so cold as to require staying indoors. Fall is also a great time to reflect on the nation\u2019s past \u2014 or, at least, the long march toward winter always puts us in a contemplative mood. You can look back in a number of ways \u2014 by traveling to Civil War battle sites, say, or visiting famous, purportedly \u201chaunted\u201d locations.",
        "On Friday, a new video surfaced that showed Donald Trump doing to former Miss Universe Jennifer Hawkins \u2014 in public, onstage in front of thousands of people \u2014 the same thing that he bragged about doing on a leaked audio tape with Billy Bush of Access Hollywood. On that now infamous 2005 tape, Trump said of beautiful women: \u201cI just start kissing them. It\u2019s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don\u2019t even wait.",
        "Happy Halloween weekend! Before you break out the candy, costumes, and scary movies, you might appreciate some reading material. Here is the best writing about books and related subjects on the web for the week of October 24, 2016. The New York Times has a reasonable if somewhat arbitrarily chosen list of 12 books you should read in your 20s. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have four books to finish within the next two years. In honor of Halloween, Electric Literature compiled a list of 11 novels that feature emotional ghosts.",
        "Terri Rote, a woman from Des Moines, Iowa, was seriously worried that the polls are rigged against Donald Trump. So she allegedly tried to vote twice for the Republican candidate for president. \u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on doing it twice. It was spur of the moment,\u201d Rote told Iowa Public Radio. \u201cThe polls are rigged. \u201d If Rote is convicted, she faces up to five years in prison. Two other people in Iowa are currently charged with voter fraud after they allegedly voted by mail and in person.",
        "Sorry, horror fans, ghost hunters, and demon enthusiasts: Despite their long history as hoax spiritualist devices turned hit toys turned tools of the devil, Ouija boards won\u2019t actually put you in contact with demons or spirits. Any scary firsthand reports you might hear or read of Ouija board horror stories are exaggerations, false claims, or a misunderstanding of how Ouija boards actually work. That might be disappointing news if you\u2019re hosting a Halloween sleepover, but it might also leave you asking, \u201cHow do Ouija boards work?\u201d The answer is surprisingly simple."
