        "My thinking became second nature. Every time I would walk down the stairs, I would think about what would happened if I were to accidentally fall. Without health insurance, I had to worry about the financial risk if I became injured. Would I be able to pay the bills? My mortgage? Could one slip cause me to lose my house? I went 10 years without health care. Now that I\u2019m in my late 50s, the Affordable Care Act has been a real godsend, finally making health care costs reasonable for me.",
        "It\u2019s Halloween. You\u2019re getting ready to throw a party, or maybe hand out candy on your front porch. Time to turn on some tunes to set the mood. But wait: \u201cThriller,\u201d \u201cMonster Mash,\u201d \u201cGhostbusters?\u201d Yawn. You don\u2019t have to be stuck with these overplayed picks \u2014 there are spookier songs out there that are just as thematic for October 31. So don your witch\u2019s hat or pop in your vampire fangs and queue up the 14 songs below. beware.",
        "It\u2019s not your imagination, and you\u2019re not seeing double: There really are two movies out this weekend with the word \u201dinferno\u201d in the title. One of them, Inferno, is the third film in the Da Vinci Code series, based on the novel by Dan Brown, directed by Ron Howard, and starring Tom Hanks. The other, Into the Inferno, is a documentary that\u2019s (sort of) about volcanoes, directed by Werner Herzog. It\u2019s hard to imagine two more different films.",
        "Let\u2019s imagine Daniel and Henry are vacationing in Yellowstone National Park, and set up camp in the 50 square miles of the park that are in Idaho (unlike most of the park, which is in Wyoming). They get into a fight and Daniel winds up killing Henry. But rather than bury the body and try to cover up the crime, Daniel freely admits to it and surrenders himself to the authorities.",
        "This week, Mother Nature provided residents of the Northeast with a preview of winter. Cold rain swept through the region. Getting the comforter on the bed was a necessity. Flannel was unleashed. Also the trailer for Gilmore Girls came out. Full disclosure: I have never seen an episode of Gilmore Girls, but I understand that many people love Rory and Lorelai\u2019s signature banter.",
        "Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid ( ) says that FBI Director James Comey is sitting on \u201cexplosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government. \u201d Comey isn\u2019t telling the American public what he knows about Trump and the Russians, Reid says. But, he says, Comey seems eager to dish dirt on Hillary Clinton. In the course of investigating Anthony Weiner for sexual misconduct, the FBI gained access to a computer that had also been used by Weiner\u2019s estranged wife, senior Hillary Clinton adviser Huma Abedin.",
        "Every Sunday, we pick a new episode of the week. It could be good. It could be bad. It will always be interesting. You can read the archives here. The episode of the week for October 24 through 30, 2016, is \u201dChapter 7\u201d the seventh episode of the sixth season of FX\u2019s American Horror Story. \u201dI\u2019m not an American. I\u2019m not used to all this carnage,\u201d says Sarah Paulson\u2019s Audrey around the midpoint of \u201dChapter 7,\u201d the latest installment of American Horror Story and one of the finest episodes the show has produced.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager agrees, in principle, with the most controversial thing Hillary Clinton has ever said on the campaign trail: that some percentage of Trump supporters are deplorable. They just disagree on the arithmetic. During an interview on CNN\u2019s State of the Union Sunday, host Jake Tapper played Trump\u2019s campaign manager a clip from a Trump rally on Saturday \u2014 at which a supporter stood in front of the press pool and chanted \u201c ! !\u201d The first word out of Conway\u2019s mouth was \u201cWow.",
        "Donald Trump has gotten millions of voters to believe that he\u2019s the only thing standing between them and an American apocalypse; that if he loses, it will portend, on some level, the end of the country as they know and love it. He\u2019s conning them all. Donald Trump doesn\u2019t actually care all that much whether he wins. He knows that things, at least for him, are going to be just fine. At least, that\u2019s what his own campaign manager says he believes.",
        "The latter half of 2016 has witnessed an interesting convergence of several elements associated with one of the most famous, prolonged mass media scares in history: the \u201cSatanic Panic\u201d that troubled the US throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s. Most people, if they know of the Satanic Panic, know of it due to satanic ritual abuse, a rash of false allegations made against daycare centers in the \u201980s.",
        "2016 was supposed to be the year of women, but fittingly, it\u2019s been all about men. Although it\u2019s the first time a woman is genuinely close to winning the White House, her campaign has been overshadowed by transgressive male behaviors: alleged criminal acts inspired by their dicks.",
        "Let\u2019s get this out of the way: Good Girls Revolt isn\u2019t Mad Men, for better and for worse. That\u2019s the comparison Amazon desperately wants me to make regarding its newest drama, which takes place in 1969 and centers on the New York City newsroom of a fictionalized Newsweek magazine. Good Girls Revolt isn\u2019t nearly as thoughtful or meticulously plotted as AMC\u2019s lauded show. When it tries to be titillating \u2014 sexism is bad, but workplace sex is fun!",
        "In \u201dThe Well,\u201d The Walking Dead\u2019s first episode since its hugely rated, incredibly controversial season seven premiere, the show . .. didn\u2019t follow up on that premiere at all. The Saviors popped in for a short scene to remind you they exist, but the episode mostly concerned Morgan and Carol hanging out with their new best friend King Ezekiel and a CGI tiger named Shiva. Fans of the show won\u2019t be surprised by this.",
        "It\u2019s hard to know where to start with Westworld. Like the maze some of its characters are trying to find, there are no clear ways in, no easy answers. We don\u2019t even know if they\u2019re looking for what lies at the center or the exit. For now, it\u2019s mostly just about the dizzying journey, round and round until something gives. In the first four episodes, this is simultaneously exhilarating and frustrating. In \u201cContrapasso,\u201d though, a hint of something more concrete finally emerges from Westworld\u2019s mysteries. And honestly, thank God.",
        "In the past 12 hours, a flurry of stories have come out on Donald Trump\u2019s links to Russia. One such story, at Slate, suggests that a server owned by Trump has been communicating with a Russian bank with ties to the Kremlin. Another, at Mother Jones, quotes an unnamed former intelligence officer claiming that Trump is a Russian operative, one who has been \u201dcompromised\u201d by Moscow \u201dfor at least 5 years.\u201d These stories are overblown, for reasons my colleagues Matt Yglesias and Timothy Lee explain rather well.",
        "What campaign organizers do over the next 36 hours might not determine the course of the 2016 presidential election. It will determine something even bigger than that. For one thing, the fate of the Senate hangs in the balance, and operations could make the difference between a unified Democratic government and two years of implacable partisan gridlock. It could mean the difference between a Supreme Court and an (and liable to dwindle) one, or between a House of Representatives interested in passing the president\u2019s legislation or in investigating her administration.",
        "In June, a Yale Law School graduate and Silicon Valley executive born in the backwater Appalachian region published a book about the white working class in America. Titled Hillbilly Elegy, the book could not have come at a more fortuitous time. Against the backdrop of a divisive presidential campaign, J. D. Vance\u2019s meditation on the anxieties of the white working class was desperately needed. There are several cleavages in this election, but none more significant than race and education. According to a July Pew Research Center poll, Trump leads Clinton among whites 57 percent to 36 percent.",
        "Since the start of the Republican primaries, hundreds of thousands of words and hours of television airtime have been devoted to one question: What do Donald Trump\u2019s supporters want? The 42 percent of Americans supporting Trump have been studied and caricatured and psychoanalyzed. Explanations abound: They\u2019re stricken with economic anxiety. They\u2019re anxious about their social status. They feel left behind by the federal government. They\u2019re authoritarians who want a forceful leader. They\u2019re racists who oppose the changing demographics and norms of the US. But there\u2019s another important factor that these analyses have largely left out: sexism.",
        "Obamacare\u2019s fourth open enrollment season begins today, at an especially tumultuous time for the law. Premiums on the marketplace are rising, on average, 22 percent. This has raised questions of whether healthy people will continue to enroll, or whether those who don\u2019t receive subsidies might decide to quit the marketplace. In prior years, premiums have risen at a much slower pace. They grew by about 2. 5 percent in 2015 and 7. 5 percent in 2016.",
        "Republican primary voters chose a presidential candidate who wants to deport 11 million Mexican immigrants, thinks climate change is a hoax, and has called for the biggest tax cuts in modern history. Democratic primary voters came very close to nominating a presidential candidate who calls himself a \u201cdemocratic socialist,\u201d wants to expand federal spending by $33 trillion, and proposed the biggest tax increases in modern history.",
        "The scene looks apocalyptic from space \u2014 thick plumes of black and white smoke obscuring the landscape of northern Iraq near Mosul, the central battleground in the war against the Islamic State. That white plume was captured by NASA satellites on October 22, shortly after ISIS militants set fire to a large sulfur plant in the area. The resulting pollution, which can cause severe respiratory problems and irritate the eyes and throat, has killed two people and sent at least 1, 000 others to hospitals.",
        "Across his eight years in office, President Obama has overseen an enormous amount of consequential policy change. He\u2019s also presided over a broad and deep collapse of the Democratic Party at lower levels that simply can\u2019t be reversed in 2016 because far too many state and local offices aren\u2019t on the ballot this fall. Turning that around ought to be one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s major goals in office. The transition provides a great opportunity to get started by tapping young, talented, ambitious people whose elevation to federal jobs can set them up for later runs for federal office.",
        "Harry Reid\u2019s incendiary Sunday letter to FBI Director James Comey was noted at the time mostly for its allegation that Comey may have violated the Hatch Act by dropping his vaguely phrased letter to Congress about emails that may or may not be new found on Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop. But the more important section of the letter may be the other part, in which Reid slammed Comey for hypocrisy on the grounds that the FBI was sitting on \u201cexplosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government.",
        "Donald Trump has been arguing that the 2016 election will be rigged, provoking concerns about what his supporters may do if \u2014 as seems likely \u2014 he loses. In fact, as President Obama and many others have pointed out, the decentralized nature of our system makes the coordinated hijacking of a national election all but impossible. Such a feat would require coordination and conspiracy on a truly massive scale \u2014 with so many participants that many would surely be caught in the act. That does not mean that there aren\u2019t problems with the apparatus of our elections.",
        "I was raped one night in my first semester of college. It has taken a long time and a lot of hard work to begin recovering from the trauma I experienced that night. I was doing what all excited freshman do: going to parties and drinking under age, though slightly curbed by my involvement in the varsity volleyball program. I was lucky to have my teammates as a support system.",
        "Vox Sentences is your daily digest for what\u2019s happening in the world, curated by Dara Lind and Dylan Matthews. Sign up for the Vox Sentences newsletter, delivered straight to your inbox Monday through Friday, or view the Vox Sentences archive for past editions. Jim Comey\u2019s decision to reanimate the zombie Clinton email scandal continues to raise questions; the most powerful woman in South Korea was its shamanistic \u201dshadow president\u201d; why people are checking in on Facebook from Standing Rock. What was he thinking?",
        "Last Friday evening, Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk unveiled three new products. The rollout \u2014 scheduled, oddly, for 8:30 pm Eastern \u2014 had been hyped for weeks, but the actual event turned out to be a bit [sad trombone]. It was a fairly transparent bid to justify the proposed merger of Tesla and SolarCity to investors, but if I were one of those investors, I would not be very reassured.",
        "Even after he won the election, Donald Trump is still, without any evidence whatsoever, claiming that there were millions of fraudulent votes cast in 2016. The latest version of this claim reportedly came in a meeting with congressional leaders on Monday.",
        "Since FBI Director James Comey released that conspicuously vague letter last Friday, the political world has been abuzz over its implications. Will it damage Hillary Clinton? Will it push the mythical \u201cundecideds\u201d into Trump\u2019s camp? Does it even matter? The politics of this are muddled. But equally interesting are the legal questions surrounding Comey\u2019s decision to publicly notify Congress of his discovery of new and potentially pertinent emails. Is there a precedent for this kind of action fewer than two weeks before an election? Was Comey legally obligated to do what he did?",
        "The zombie, by its physical nature, inspires fear. It is and bloodied, missing a limb or an eyeball. It lurches forward in tattered clothing, arms reaching out for supple flesh. Among a sea of gaunt, gangling bodies, it hobbles over its own intestines and chatters its decaying teeth. But looking back at the history of the zombie in American culture, from its entry into our consciousness to The Walking Dead, the creature is more than an aesthetic horror \u2014 it is a form of political commentary."
