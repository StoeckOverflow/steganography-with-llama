        "How does a mathematician approach incredible coincidences? Is there a way to apply logic to flukes and twists of fate? To find out, I spoke with Joseph Mazur, the author of Fluke: The Math and Myth of Coincidence. He\u2019s an author and mathematician who specializes in looking at the odds behind seemingly unlikely events. We looked at one famous story from his book \u2014 a 1932 New Yorker article that, over time, has turned into a kind of internet legend.",
        "Imagine for a moment that Tuesday evening Americans gather \u2019round their Twitter feeds and television sets and begin to see that the polls were wrong. Not wrong by much, necessarily, but off by about 5 points in each state, meaning that Donald Trump will be elected president and that Republicans will maintain \u2014 or even slightly expand \u2014 their majorities in Congress. Now imagine that none of the darkest fears of Trump\u2019s critics come to pass.",
        "Democrats are breathing a sigh of relief today, as a new release from a highly respected Wisconsin pollster shows Hillary Clinton beating Donald Trump by 6 percentage points among likely voters in the state. The Wisconsin result, from Marquette Law, is significant because the state is a crucial part of Clinton\u2019s \u201cfirewall\u201d \u2014 her easiest path to winning an Electoral College majority and staving off a late surge from Donald Trump.",
        "One of the odd aspects of modern air travel is that it\u2019s not really getting any faster. Ever since British Airways retired its supersonic Concorde in 2003, airlines have generally stuck to top speeds of around 615 miles per hour. That\u2019ll get you from New York to San Francisco in five or six hours, depending on the winds, but you can\u2019t find a plane that will get you there significantly sooner. We\u2019ve largely learned to tolerate our slow, boring aircraft. But there\u2019s a compelling case that we shouldn\u2019t \u2014 that air travel should actually be much, much quicker.",
        "With six days before the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton is still ahead in the polls. But many of her supporters are anxious \u2014 worried the revelation that the FBI is looking through 650, 000 more emails in its investigation into her use of a private email server will change voters\u2019 minds at the last minute, and polls won\u2019t be able to capture the shift until it\u2019s too late. A new poll of Wisconsin, conducted by Marquette University Law School, should put those worries to rest \u2014 or at least reduce them greatly.",
        "President Obama appeared in North Carolina on Wednesday to stump for Hillary Clinton. And to explain the stakes in the election, he asked his audience to remember how the world looked eight years ago. \u201cYou may not remember exactly where we were as a country when I visited Raleigh in the final days of the 2008 campaign,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe were living through two long wars. We were in the early days of the worst economic crisis in 80 years. The economy was teetering on the edge of a great depression.",
        "There\u2019s a new study making the rounds about a seemingly effective male birth control. The hormonal injection, designed to slow or block sperm production, had a 96 percent success rate at preventing pregnancy among couples who completed the study. There was just one problem, according to some media reports: The new method won\u2019t be available anytime soon because the men in the study were wimps. They couldn\u2019t handle side effects \u2014 moodiness, acne \u2014 that women on birth control deal with all the time, and so the study had to be terminated.",
        "If you turn on your TV, his face might well pop up in fare like Steel Sharks, Executive Decision, and Roseanne. His lines are almost always the same \u2014 \u201dDeath to America!\u201d \u201dI will kill you, American scum!\u201d For years, Ahmed Ahmed played the terrorist. Until he decided to stop. When he rejected roles, his phone stopped ringing \u2014 there were no other casting calls for him.",
        "One of Donald Trump\u2019s most frequent talking points on the campaign trail is that the presidential election is somehow \u201drigged\u201d in Hillary Clinton\u2019s favor. Trump uses the term as shorthand for everything from media bias to voter fraud, and his supporters seem to have taken his claims to heart. Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2016 An Iowa woman was arrested and charged with voter fraud after casting two ballots for Trump.",
        "Before he was running for president, Donald Trump was known for getting in all sorts of feuds with celebrities. But among his most bizarre feuds \u2014 and there\u2019s a long list \u2014 was one that ended with Trump calling former Daily Show host Jon Stewart \u201da pussy.\u201d Stewart retold the story at the 10th annual \u201dStand Up For Heroes\u201d event in New York City on Tuesday. It began, Stewart said, one day when he realized that Trump was suddenly \u2014 with no explanation whatsoever \u2014 calling out Stewart on Twitter for changing his name.",

Dems stop freaking out about FBI, start freaking out about black turnout; some of these white supremacist voter suppression plots are kind of a joke; an electoral victory for the status quo in Iceland. The Clinton firewall is holding Hillary Clinton is still probably going to win the 2016 presidential election.",
        "The latest Hillary Clinton email revelations arose out of an unrelated investigation into Anthony Weiner\u2019s sexting. The best way to understand this odd hopscotch is through the Prime Directive of Clinton investigations: We know the Clintons are guilty; the only question is what are they guilty of and when will we find the evidence? So somehow an investigation that once upon a time was about a terrorist attack on an American consulate becomes an inquiry into Freedom of Information Act compliance, which shifts into a question about handling of classified material.",
        "On Tuesday, Philadelphia\u2019s transit workers went on strike, halting all bus, trolley, and rail service in the city. And, given the time of year, lots of people are wondering how this might affect the presidential election. Pennsylvania is a key swing state, after all. The short answer is that this probably won\u2019t matter much, though there\u2019s always a chance. Democratic Congress member Bob Brady told the Philadelphia Inquirer that Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign has at least \u201ca little concern. \u201d So let\u2019s take a look.",
        "Hillary Clinton often gets described as an incrementalist, with a relatively modest agenda. This makes sense, given that she spent the past two years or so running against a literal democratic socialist and Donald Trump. But this depiction misleads more than it informs. Amid her blizzard of plans and white papers, the scope and ambition of Clinton\u2019s program often gets missed. Just imagine, for a second, what a world in which it all became law would look like. The vast majority of families would be able to send children to public colleges and universities .",
        "If you\u2019re a Democrat, the FiveThirtyEight forecast is probably making you feel anxious right about now. Just last week, Nate Silver\u2019s forecast gave Hillary Clinton an overwhelming 85 percent chance of winning. But as of Thursday morning, her odds have fallen down to 66. 9 percent \u2014 suggesting that while Donald Trump is still the underdog, there\u2019s a shot he\u2019ll end up the next president.",
        "If Hillary Clinton wins the presidential election on November 8, two things are true, according to political consultant \u2014 and Donald Trump\u2019s close friend \u2014 Roger Stone. First, that \u201cwe are not quite at the point where the mainstream media is losing all of its power. \u201d And second, Trump\u2019s movement isn\u2019t going anywhere. \u201cThe party isn\u2019t going to go back to being the country club party of Jeb Bush,\u201d he said in a phone interview two weeks before Election Day. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to go back to being the Washington establishment party of Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell.",
        "Correction: The article below incorrectly suggested that we know the tweet under discussion is a hoax. The kind of prediction made in Gio\u2019s tweet is frequently the subject of the scams discussed in this piece, but we did not take the necessary steps to confirm that Gio intentionally perpetrated a hoax. This story was not up to our standards, and we deeply regret the error. The article\u2019s text has been updated to properly reflect our uncertainty. It sounds unbelievable, right?",
        "In these final frenzied days before Election Day, Hillary Clinton finds herself in an unexpected and uncomfortable place: forced to campaign against not just Donald Trump, but also against WikiLeaks, the Russian government, and even the director of the FBI. It\u2019s hard to overstate how unprecedented \u2014 and troubling \u2014 a moment we\u2019re living through. In the aftermath of a leaked recording of Donald Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women, Clinton opened up an lead in some polls and seemed to be cruising toward a potential landslide win.",
        "As the Bible tells it, the first crime committed was a lapse of . Eve was forbidden from tasting the fruit on the tree of knowledge. But the temptation was too much. The fruit was just so \u201cpleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom,\u201d Genesis reads. Who wouldn\u2019t want that? Humanity was just days old, but already we were succumbing to a vice. The takeaway from this story was clear: when temptation overcomes willpower, it\u2019s a moral failing, worthy of punishment. psychologists might not blame Eve for her errant ways at all.",
        "A month ago, Amit Kumar sat in his office, nervously watching the polls intersect. As a Clinton supporter in deeply blue state, the Silicon entrepreneur knew his vote wouldn\u2019t do much to affect the outcome. He also knew that elsewhere in the country \u2014 particularly in the crucially important swing states \u2014 large numbers of votes were tightening the race. Kumar realized that the best way he could help was by getting these swing state residents to vote for Clinton, while still being able to show support for their original candidates. His solution: \u201cLet them trade votes.",
        "Louis C. K. is supporting Hillary Clinton in next week\u2019s presidential election, and it\u2019s not just because she\u2019s a woman. It\u2019s because she\u2019s a mom. \u201cA mother\u2019s just got it,\u201d C. K. told Conan O\u2019Brien on Conan Tuesday night. \u201cShe feeds you and teaches you, she protects you, she takes care of shit. \u201d Mothers, C. K. says, make better presidents than fathers. We\u2019ve had fathers as presidents for the past 240 years, but \u201ca great father can give a kid 40 percent of his needs, tops. Tops out at 40 percent.",
        "Gender is a cardinal issue in this year\u2019s election. On one side is the first woman to have won the presidential nomination of a major party, and on the other is a raging misogynist who has celebrated his apparent sexual predation on tape. Beyond the election, gender issues are playing out across society. From concern on campuses about rape culture to calls to close the wage gap, gender equity is a pervasive concern. Christina Hoff Sommers is a writer, former professor, and now a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.",
        "Starbucks is typically a touchstone for consistency, a beacon of predictability we can take comfort in while the chaotic world around us threatens to swallow us whole. The company\u2019s drip coffee will always taste like it was drawn from the last viable vein of a lifetime chain smoker. Its cold brew tastes fantastic but somehow the first sip on the first day of summer is incomparable. Everyone knows that when you walk into Starbucks, small, medium, and large become Tall, Grande, and Venti.",
        "The presidential race may be sucking up all of the oxygen, but there\u2019s a photo finish shaping up for control of Congress. Republicans are trying to defend a narrow majority in the Senate. Democrats look certain to pick up several seats \u2014 whether they\u2019ll do well enough to regain the majority could come down to a few close races. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives looks likely to stay in Republican hands. Barring some big and unforeseen political shock, the GOP\u2019s hold on the lower chamber appears likely to extend into 2017.",
        "Some time ago, Hillary Clinton and her advisers decided that the best course of action was to apologize for having used a personal email address to conduct government business while serving as secretary of state. Clinton herself was, clearly, not really all that remorseful about this, and it showed in her early efforts to address it. Eventually aides prevailed upon her to express a greater degree of regret, which they hoped would lay the issue to rest. It did not.",
        "In many ways, this is the election that Fox News built. For years, the network has stoked the fires of resentment of Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and \u201dliberal elites\u201d \u2014 while simultaneously giving prominence and credibility to the Tea Party, to \u201dissues\u201d like birtherism and the New Black Panthers, and to those darlings of the right Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin. Its coverage foreshadowed much of what makes the Trump campaign distinctive \u2014 the bluster, the conspiratorial mindset, the Obama hatred \u2014 even if the network was, at first, resistant to embracing the real estate mogul.",
        "This is a story about the swing voter. The voter who, days before the election, doesn\u2019t know if she wants to vote for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton \u2014 or, hell, maybe Jill Stein or Gary Johnson. You\u2019re going to hear a lot about these mythical people in the runup to the election. You can just search \u201dswing voter\u201d to see how common this narrative is: This is because many pundits think swing voters decide elections.",
        "This is awkward. Anyone who has ever come into contact with my opinionated, sassy grandma feels inspired by her women\u2019s empowerment shtick. One doesn\u2019t even have to ask a prompting question \u2014 she\u2019ll just launch into her signature pontification about how the need is dire for more of us, us women, to enter into positions of power.",
        "Trees can make a city sidewalk prettier, sure. But that\u2019s not even their best trick. A growing pile of research suggests that planting more urban trees, if done right, could save tens of thousands of lives around the world each year \u2014 by soaking up pollution and cooling down deadly heat waves. In fact, as a fascinating new report from the Nature Conservancy details, a tree campaign could be of the smartest investments a hot, polluted city can make."
