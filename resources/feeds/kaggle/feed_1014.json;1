        "Less than a week before the election, alarm bells went off over Hillary Clinton\u2019s perceived \u201cblack voter problem. \u201d A new poll conducted by the African American Research Collaborative, which polled 1, 200 registered voters representative of the national black voting population \u2014 excluding voters and focusing on Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Georgia \u2014 found that black voters are, in fact, less enthusiastic about voting in the presidential election.",
        "Many Florida voters are about to get tricked. There\u2019s an initiative on the state ballot this year called Amendment 1. Read casually, it appears to be . In fact, it would lock innovative solar companies out of state markets and lead to higher rates and fees for households and businesses that choose to go solar. It would effectively crush the nascent rooftop solar market in the state. The majority of Florida voters love rooftop solar. They have said so repeatedly in polls and surveys.",
        "The Electoral College is one of the more bizarre quirks of the US presidential race. Instead of relying on the popular vote, a presidential candidate needs the majority of the Electoral College \u2014 270 out of 538 electoral votes \u2014 to win the White House on Election Day. (And, of course, if all the candidates fail to receive at least 270 votes, then the race is sent to the House.) Each state and Washington, DC, is allocated a share of electoral votes based on the US Census.",
        "The first seven minutes of Doctor Strange, Marvel\u2019s first cinematic foray into its magical universe full of sorcerers, relics, and dark dimensions, are a punch in the mouth. It\u2019s a fight scene; Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) and his goons are taking on the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) and to get the upper hand, they begin folding the buildings around them like origami. It\u2019s vaguely reminiscent of that scene from Inception, you think to yourself. But you don\u2019t know half of what\u2019s about to hit you. Rating 3. 5 The buildings gnarl and twist like segments of a Rubik\u2019s Cube.",
        "It\u2019s come to this: The FBI, America\u2019s premier law enforcement agency, just had to decide whether to investigate one of its own Twitter accounts to see if it had an Clinton bias. The account in question, @FBIRecordsVault, burst into the news earlier this week after abruptly posting records related to Bill Clinton\u2019s \u2014 and deeply controversial \u2014 pardon of financier Marc Rich.",
        "Two things appear to be true: Early voting results are looking good for Hillary Clinton, and the polls are tightening. Clinton is now only polling about 2 points above Donald Trump nationally, according to the RealClearPolitics average, a difference that has narrowed drastically from what was a lead just over a week ago. At the same time, new early voting numbers out of Nevada and Ohio this week were a good sign for the Democratic candidate, as turnout seems to be bouncing back to 2012 levels.",
        "Would President Donald Trump have deported his own wife? The Associated Press has found documentation showing that Melania Trump broke immigration law when she first came to the US in 1996 \u2014 by entering the country on a tourist visa and then working as a professional model. It\u2019s an ironic twist for a presidential campaign that\u2019s marked itself by casting aspersions on immigrants in general, and \u201cillegal\u201d immigrants in particular, for the past 17 months. The AP\u2019s revelations probably won\u2019t sway Donald Trump\u2019s supporters in the waning days of the campaign.",
        "The good folks at NASA never miss a chance to let us know when vital bodies of water around the world are shriveling up and vanishing. First it was Lake Mead. Then it was the Aral Sea. Now it\u2019s poor Utah\u2019s turn. Earlier this week, NASA\u2019s Earth Observatory posted satellite images showing the dramatic decline of Utah\u2019s Great Salt Lake over the past five years. As the two images below from 2011 and 2016 show, water levels at Farmington Bay have plummeted, exposing of the lakebed and threatening a key waterfowl habitat: Suffice to say, that\u2019s not good.",
        "Early Sunday, our clocks were set back an hour. And many of us were able to enjoy an extra hour of sleep. But the benefit of a little extra sleep does not make up for the fact that there will be much less light in the evening hours. People who work 9 to 5 will, in a few weeks\u2019 time, leave their offices in total darkness. Daylight saving time in the US started as an energy conservation trick during World War I, and became a national standard in the 1960s. But many now feel it has outlived its usefulness.",
        "Most people familiar with history know that it\u2019s not unprecedented for an FBI director to become embroiled in politics. But the popular understanding of the FBI\u2019s intervention into electoral affairs typically extends only to J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s surveillance of civil rights groups and other leftist organizations. In reaction to the revelations about Hoover and the reform initiatives that followed, a series of FBI directors tried to put the bureau on a more neutral footing. It\u2019s that relatively recent tradition of neutrality that James Comey\u2019s announcement of a further investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s email trail has been accused of violating.",
        "What do the polls tell us? We\u2019ve had some big swings: After the Democratic convention, Hillary Clinton seemed to be locking the election up, then Trump came back to a then came a series of events \u2014 three debates, sexual assault revelations, and a war within the Republican party \u2014 which seemed to knock Trump out of the race. Then, more recently, a series of FBI leaks brought the polls back to a .",
        "Over the last generation, there\u2019s been a big shift in the way people find news stories. We used to get our news from the morning newspaper and the nightly news. Now more and more of us pull out our smartphones and look at our Facebook feeds. The result has been a disaster for the public\u2019s understanding of current affairs. Reporters have come under increasing pressure to write \u201cclickbait\u201d articles that pander to readers\u2019 worst impulses. stories gain more traction online than stories that are balanced and thoroughly reported. Partisans share totally fake stories from fringe websites.",
        "Just nine days ago, FBI director James Comey turned the presidential race upside down by writing to Congress that the FBI had discovered new emails that appeared \u201dto be pertinent\u201d to the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server. But now today, he\u2019s followed up with another letter saying that based on his team\u2019s review of all the emails to or from Clinton while she was Secretary of State, he\u2019s seen nothing to change his recommendation from July that no charges be brought against her.",
        "With a manic glint in her eye, Hillary turns toward the camera and grins so wide her teeth practically vibrate with determination. \u201cI will rise from the ashes like a phoenix \u2014 nay, like a Hillary Clinton,\u201d she declares, raising her arms above her head, \u201cand I will ascend to the high office of president and claim my rightful place in HISTORYYYYYYYYYYY. \u201d Emphasis Kate McKinnon\u2019s. Since that bombastic sketch in early 2015, Saturday Night Live has thrown McKinnon headlong into the role of impersonating Clinton.",
        "This article discusses the plot of this season\u2019s The Walking Dead. There are spoilers here. \u201cThe Cell,\u201d the third episode of The Walking Dead\u2019s seventh season, finally tells us what happened to Daryl (Norman Reedus) and the Savior known as Dwight (Austin Amelio) after Negan killed Abraham and Glenn in this season\u2019s premiere. The first half of this season will most likely rotate between Dwight\u2019s torture of Darryl; the Ezekiel story with Morgan, Carol, and a CGI tiger that we saw last week; and whatever\u2019s going on with Rick\u2019s group.",
        "As the Constitutional Convention of 1787 ended, Ben Franklin walked out of Philadelphia\u2019s Independence Hall to find an anxious crowd. According to a diary entry recorded by James McHenry, a signatory to the Constitution, a woman from Philadelphia was the first to speak to Franklin. \u201dWell, doctor,\u201d she asked, \u201cwhat have we got, a republic or a monarchy?\u201d \u201dA republic,\u201d Franklin famously replied. \u201cIf you can keep it.\u201d Perhaps we cannot. This reads like hyperbole. But is it? Consider, for a moment, the knife\u2019s edge on which the republic rests. The election is 24 hours away.",
        "People want to know who will win the election on Tuesday and are also nervous about it. Indeed, some people seem to want to be nervous about it. A trainer at my gym managed to set off a mass panic by passing on the completely inaccurate news that a poll of students at historically black colleges in Virginia found Trump leading. The truth, however, is that by almost all accounts Hillary Clinton is leading in the polls and has been leading for essentially the entire campaign.",
        "Hillary Clinton won more votes than Donald Trump in last month\u2019s presidential election. But due to the magic of the Electoral College, Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States. Yes, the November 8 \u201cpresidential election\u201d was in actuality the venerable ritual in which the residents of Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and a few other states got the privilege of choosing the president of the United States of America. Or, to be more precise, it was the venerable ritual in which all the states chose their representatives in the Electoral College.",
        "One of the great and terrible parts of being a journalist in the 21st century is easy access to any story I\u2019ve contributed to the internet. This made it especially easy to revisit an essay I wrote as a newly minted college grad, working as an editorial assistant at Newsweek magazine. It was a short contribution to a cover package on a topic du jour that, once again, is quite relevant as the presidential election nears: Hillary Clinton and gender.",
        "In the final presidential debate of this surreal election, Hillary Clinton came out with an astonishing defense of women\u2019s reproductive rights in what was probably her most powerful statement on the campaign trail. \u201dThe government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice,\u201d she said, \u201dand I will stand up for that right.\u201d It was the first time a US presidential candidate had ever spoken about abortion so starkly \u2014 and not just any candidate: the female politician to top the presidential ticket of a major party.",
        "If history is anything to go by, we can expect 80 to 100 million Americans to sit out today\u2019s presidential election. Consider what happened in 2012. There were 241 million people of voting age, but only 130. 2 million actually cast ballots in the general election \u2014 a turnout rate of just 58. 6 percent. America\u2019s turnout rate has been remarkably stable for the past 40 years, and the betting markets don\u2019t seem to think this year will be much different.",
        "The president alone can\u2019t have a huge impact on domestic policy issues. Traditionally, they just can\u2019t get much done without Congress. That normally extends to LGBTQ issues. There\u2019s a big exception for LGBTQ people in 2016. Over the past year, we have seen a lot of focus on the bathroom issue \u2014 specifically, whether transgender people should be allowed to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. To some people, this issue is befuddling. Much of the reaction I\u2019ve heard personally has amounted to: \u201cThey\u2019re bathrooms.",
        "After all that \u2014 after all the rallies, the polls, the drama, the leaks, the 17 months of American public life we will never get back \u2014 the story of the 2016 presidential election might turn out to have been set way back in June 2015, when Donald Trump came down the escalator of Trump Tower and briefly referred to Mexican immigrants as murderers and rapists. Latinos were listening. Most of America didn\u2019t take Trump seriously for the first several months of his candidacy. But two groups very much did.",
        "Plato thought political regimes followed a predictable evolutionary course, from oligarchy to democracy to tyranny. Oligarchies give way to democracies when the elites fail, when they become spoiled, lazy, profligate, and when they develop interests apart from those they rule. Democracies give way to tyrannies when mob passion overwhelms political wisdom and a populist autocrat seizes the masses. But the tyrant is not quite a tyrant at first. On the contrary, in a democracy the tyrant offers himself as the people\u2019s champion. He\u2019s the ultimate simplifier, the one man who can make everything whole again. Sound familiar?",
        "In North Carolina, the presidential, gubernatorial, and US Senate races are all pretty close \u2014 so close that any change in voter turnout could make the difference. And Democrats have received some alarming news: Black voter turnout, which President Barack Obama relied on to narrowly win the state in 2008, is down. What\u2019s going on? A lot of news reports have pointed to North Carolina Republicans\u2019 voting restrictions \u2014 including a strict voter ID requirement and early voting cuts \u2014 as the culprit.",
        "Think of Westworld as the Garden of Eden. Think of the Hosts contained within it as hundreds upon hundreds of possible Adams and possible Eves. And think of the biblical Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil as the code locked up inside of those possible Adams and possible Eves, forever twisting toward sentience. Do you think, in that scenario, that Ford is God or the Snake? You can make a great argument for either.",
        "This election season has been unusual in a variety of ways. In one way, however, it\u2019s been entirely normal, just like previous elections. To wit: Climate change didn\u2019t come up. This fact barely needs explaining. It is pretty much what you\u2019d expect, given various features of US politics and human psychology (which I get into below). It is, nonetheless, worth taking a step back and reflecting on how batshit crazy it is. The stakes involved are almost unthinkably large. We can say, without hyperbole, that the effects of this election will be felt centuries from now.",
        "Hillary Clinton is the favorite to win Tuesday\u2019s presidential election. But the race has tightened of late in both national and swing state polls, and there\u2019s been increasing chatter suggesting that Clinton\u2019s \u201cfirewall\u201d protecting an Electoral College majority could be in danger. The big picture, though, is that Clinton has two broad paths toward reaching 270 electoral votes: 1) Holding her six \u201cfirewall\u201d states: Virginia, Colorado, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire. Those states, combined with the solidly Democratic states, would give her the presidency.",
        "Donald Trump is the underdog in Tuesday\u2019s presidential election. But he still has a shot of winning, at least if you believe the FiveThirtyEight forecast. So what would his path to Electoral College victory look like? Essentially, the likeliest way Trump can top 270 electoral votes appears to be by: 1) Holding the lean Trump swing states of Iowa, Ohio, and Arizona 2) Winning the states of Florida and North Carolina 3) Winning either one more big state like Pennsylvania or Michigan or multiple smaller remaining contests. Let\u2019s walk through it.",
        "More than just the presidency is at stake tonight. The battle for which party will control the Senate is coming down to the wire, too \u2014 and now with Sen. Pat Toomey\u2019s win in Pennsylvania, Democrats dreams of regaining the Senate are over. Going into tonight\u2019s election, Republicans held a majority in the Senate and are now looking to hold onto that majority."
