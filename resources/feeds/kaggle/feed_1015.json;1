        "Everyone expected Tuesday\u2019s presidential election would be boring. Millions would cast votes for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. One candidate would win, the other would lose, and that would be that. But given the closeness in the race right now, there\u2019s at least a chance the final results could be much, much messier. Like: an Electoral College tie that has to get resolved by Congress. A disputed state. A pivotal elector going rogue.",
        "The \u201cI Voted\u201d sticker is the nationwide symbol of Election Day. But what your sticker looks like depends on where you live. Some jurisdictions have the simple, iconic white oval with an American flag and the text \u201cI Voted. \u201d But others get fancier. There are round stickers and stickers and, in Memphis, stickers the shape of Tennessee. Some stickers in Georgia have a peach; in New Orleans, a bright blue corgi. They\u2019re written in English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Chinese, and the Alaska Native language of Yupik. We asked readers to show us their stickers from Election Day.",
        "Maps are one of the most compelling ways to understand our nation\u2019s political history. So in light of last night\u2019s tumultuous election \u2014 which featured some unexpected results \u2014 we\u2019ve assembled a map for every presidential contest going back 56 years. How has America\u2019s political landscape changed over time? What were the biggest blowouts? And what new regional trends have emerged in the way we vote? Let\u2019s start by going back to 1960. Kennedy edges out Nixon In a very close election, John F. Kennedy edged out Richard Nixon by a mere 112, 827 votes.",
        "As the candidates make their closing arguments before Election Day, millions of Americans have already cast their ballots for the presidential election. At least 42 million citizens have voted early, with more than 18 million ballots cast in battleground states. This is a bit of a from 2012, when 46 million people voted early. Since early voting is a sign of enthusiasm for the candidates, it\u2019s an indication that fewer voters were motivated to get to the polls early \u2014 perhaps due to the unpopularity of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.",
        "Donald Trump has a path to become the next president of the United States on Tuesday. Donald Trump is not a man who should be president. This is not an ideological judgment. This is not something I would say about Mitt Romney or Marco Rubio. This is not a disagreement over Trump\u2019s tax plan or his climate policies. This is about Trump\u2019s character, his temperament, his impulsiveness, his basic decency. Back in February, I wrote that Trump is the most dangerous major candidate for president in memory.",
        "It takes 270 electoral votes to win the election. And since 74 of them are located in the Pacific time zone (with three more in Hawaii) it\u2019s difficult for a Democrat to formally lock them up until relatively late in the night. But back in the real world, we know that Clinton is going to carry those states, and the election will really come down to a handful of swing states.",
        "Imagine an alternate reality where the 2016 presidential election is such faint background noise that it barely registers in your consciousness at all, leaving you free to go to New York Fashion Week, record flirt with Drake, cuddle koalas with your BFF Serena van der Woodsen, and shoot down water slides while clutching an American flag. That has been Taylor Swift\u2019s public life throughout this long, grueling, contentious election cycle. While many other celebrities, including her close friend Lena Dunham, came out in support of one candidate or another \u2014 though mostly Hillary Clinton \u2014 Swift remained decidedly neutral.",
        "The media is a familiar target in this year\u2019s presidential election, with both sides finding plenty to complain about. Trump, despite coasting to the Republican nomination on a $2 billion wave of free media, whines endlessly about bias. \u201dWe cannot let the media get away with it,\u201d Trump wrote in a recent fundraising letter. \u201cWe MUST fight back.\u201d And Clinton surrogates like Lanny Davis have lamented the \u201cobvious display of media bias\u201d in this election. According to Davis, the mad dash to win news cycles has created a false equivalence between the candidates.",
        "Hillary Clinton goes into the presidential election as the favorite to win \u2014 but the outcome of the battle for the Senate looks much less certain. As the campaign winds down, seven races still appear to remain up for grabs. And polls are all over the place in many of them, leaving us unclear how strong Democrats\u2019 prospects of retaking the chamber truly are. Democrats would need a net gain of four seats to retake the Senate if Clinton wins the White House (and five if Trump wins).",
        "The first wave of exit poll results has been released \u2014 with coverage by NBC News, ABC News, and Politico, among others \u2014 and an electorate is picking over it, trying to find significant information. But it\u2019s very easy to go astray when looking at exit polls \u2014 especially early ones. The exit polls are designed to allow networks to call races in particular states as quickly as possible. So they\u2019re going to be at their most reliable when they\u2019re projecting whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will win, say, Missouri (and who will win the Senate race there).",
        "The white working class turned out, and they struck back. The morning after, that already appears to be the dominant media narrative coming out of the 2016 presidential election. Sure, the black and Latino voters that Hillary Clinton was counting on to deliver her to victory were there \u2014 but white turnout was up, and especially among white people without college degrees, there was a major swing to Trump. There\u2019s already furious debate about why this is, and how it jibes with data suggesting that Trump supporters are richer, not poorer, than average.",
        "Donald Trump has won the presidency, despite an unprecedented level of unfitness and in defiance of nearly every prediction and poll. And he\u2019s done this not despite but because he expressed unfiltered disdain toward racial and religious minorities in the country. The message his victory sent to nonwhites, Muslim Americans, immigrants, and their families is clear: Never underestimate the power of racism and bigotry. In his victory speech early Wednesday morning, Trump promised to serve all Americans.",
        "By all accounts, the biggest races on Election Day were a total disaster for Democrats. Donald Trump won. Republicans kept Congress, holding back a Democratic attempt to retake the Senate. And down the ballot, the results weren\u2019t much better for the party: Democrats overall lost governors\u2019 races, although the results were more mixed in state legislatures. But not all is doom and gloom. While Democrats lost big, liberals won some of the big initiatives that were on statewide ballots.",
        "Mainstream political leaders of some of America\u2019s closest Western allies gasped as the news broke that Donald Trump had been elected as the new leader of the free world. The French ambassador to the United States tweeted, \u201cA world is crumbling before our eyes. Vertigo. \u201d Germany\u2019s foreign minister lamented that \u201cUS foreign policy will be less predictable for us,\u201d and warned, \u201cNothing will be easier. Much will be harder. \u201d Former Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt called it a \u201cyear of double disaster of the West,\u201d referring to the equally stunning Brexit vote.",
        "This is certainly not how I expected this to end. In a genuinely shocking upset, overturning the results of even the most cautious polling models, Donald Trump won the presidency of the United States. He beat arguably the most experienced candidate ever put forward by a major party, the wife of a beloved former president who served our current quite popular president and would have made history as the first woman to ever lead America. Most of us are still in shock \u2014 I know I am.",
        "It was supposed to go like this: At the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City, standing under a glass ceiling, Hillary Clinton was going to claim her victory as the first woman president. That didn\u2019t happen. She lost, in a shocking upset, and at a event Clinton took a much smaller stage at the New Yorker Hotel in New York City, conceding the election to Donald Trump \u2014 the Republican nominee who not only trailed her in the polls, but was less favorable in the electoral map, running a campaign on divisive, fearmongering tactics.",
        "Donald Trump won the presidency. He didn\u2019t win America. Arguably, he didn\u2019t really even try. Part of the ritual of American politics \u2014 the performance of the peaceful transfer of power \u2014 is the point after the presidential election when the winner reaches across the aisle to the losers, when he (always he) promises to be a president not just for the people who voted for him but for all Americans. Donald Trump has never had much patience for the rituals of American politics. In general, he\u2019s preferred to play to his most enthusiastic fans.",
        "The Electoral College will officially elect Donald Trump as the next president today, but it\u2019s important to remember that he received fewer votes from Americans than Hillary Clinton \u2014 something more than half of Republicans don\u2019t know. An updated count by the Cook Political Report shows Trump lost the popular vote by about 2. 1 percentage points. Meanwhile, Trump racked up 306 electoral voters \u2014 14 percent more than Clinton. Don\u2019t let recent history fool you into thinking this has happened a lot. Sure, we saw this in 2000, when George W.",
        "This is happening. Donald Trump is going to be president of the United States. And there\u2019s no way around it: What he\u2019s planning to do looks like a disaster for the planet (and the people on it). Specifically, all the fragile progress the world has made on global warming over the past eight years is now in real danger of being blown up. Trump has been crystal clear about his environmental plans.",
        "Donald Trump has won the election. Now it is up to America\u2019s institutions, and the people within them, to check his worst instincts. There is danger in Trump. He\u2019s a man with authoritarian impulses, a conspiracy theorist\u2019s bent, and a taste for vengeance. He has an alarming temperament, little impulse control, and less decency. He has a demagogue\u2019s instinct for finding enemies and a bully\u2019s instinct for finding their weaknesses. He is uninterested in policy, unrestrained by shame, and unbound by norms.",
        "Stephen Colbert didn\u2019t think she would lose. You could tell from the way he paced the stage at the start of his live election night special, which aired on Showtime, the corporate, premium cable cousin of his usual network, CBS. There was an extra jitter to his walk, and the jokes \u2014 which had clearly been written for a evening where, by the time the special began, Hillary Clinton was expected to be on her way to a small but decisive victory \u2014 fizzled. Colbert\u2019s audience laughed, but there was no enthusiasm.",
        "The Republicans won more than the presidency last night \u2014 the party also held onto its majorities in the House and Senate. And for the first time since 2007, Republicans will control both the executive and legislative branches of government. Control of the legislative branch will make it easier for Donald Trump to pursue significant policy change (repealing Obamacare, for example). And with key Supreme Court nominations at stake, the party has a good chance of changing the balance of power of the judicial branch as well.",
        "Against all odds, polls, and projections, Donald Trump claimed victory in the presidential election Tuesday, delivering a speech at the Hilton Hotel in New York City on Tuesday to a cheering crowd of supporters. It was an unexpected outcome for the Republican candidate, who beat out not only a stacked GOP primary field but also an even more formidable opponent in Hillary Clinton, who was consistently ahead of him in the polls up and in a much stronger position on the electoral map.",
        "In a major blow to the beverage industry, all four cities that voted on soda taxes yesterday passed them in landslide victories. San Francisco, Oakland, and Albany, California, voted in ballot measures that would levy a tax on distributors of sugary drinks. The people of Boulder, Colorado, also said yes to a excise tax on distributors. \u201dThis is an astonishing repudiation of big soda. For too long, the big soda companies got away with putting profits over their customers\u2019 health,\u201d said Jim Krieger, the executive director of Healthy Food America.",
        "If Donald Trump is elected the 45th president of the United States, it won\u2019t be because of his exhaustive policy platform. His agenda for the country was occasionally vague at best. But no one can pretend that Trump didn\u2019t tell America exactly what he wanted to do on immigration. From the day he launched his campaign, immigration has been at the focus of his message and his appeal. His policies on the subject have always been a level more developed than everything else on his agenda.",
        "The media\u2019s coverage of the 2016 race didn\u2019t win the election for Donald Trump, but it didn\u2019t help. Back in September, Gallup presented the findings of an important research project that, in retrospect, ought to have prompted a lot more soul searching among members of the press. What they did was, over an extended period of time, survey people and ask them what they were hearing about the two candidates. The answer is that with regard to Hillary Clinton, they heard a lot about email. With regard to Trump, they heard about nothing in particular.",
        "Dear America, Amidst the confusion, and despair, and disbelief, it was suggested to me by a very close friend of mine (I won\u2019t say her name to protect her identity) (Ann. It was Ann) that perhaps a few people would enjoy hearing my thoughts on this election. So I sat down at my computer, cleared my head, and opened a document. Then I started crying. So I had some hot chocolate, and my close friend (Ann) rubbed my back for a while, and I got myself together, and sat down. And started crying.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s election means that a lot of policy change is coming to Washington, DC \u2014 and likely a lot faster than many people realize. In an October speech at Gettysburg, Trump laid out everything he wanted to do in his first 100 days in office as president. (I\u2019ve posted the full text below, via NPR.) It\u2019s a list, encompassing everything from scrapping Obamacare and initiating mass deportations to putting in place a hiring freeze for new federal employees.",
        "If Donald Trump\u2019s win were the Democratic Party\u2019s only problem, the party\u2019s leaders would be justified in affecting a certain amount of complacency. After all, in a year when models predicted a narrow Republican victory, Clinton actually pulled out a majority of the popular vote. That makes the Democrats from 1992 to 2016 the only political party in American history to win the popular vote in six elections out of seven. It\u2019s actually kind of impressive. What\u2019s less impressive is that at the level, the Obama years have created a Democratic Party that\u2019s essentially a smoking pile of rubble.",
        "Donald Trump traveled to the White House to meet President Barack Obama today, and the two recapped their meeting in a brief press appearance in the Oval Office afterward. \u201cI just had the opportunity to have an excellent conversation with Trump,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt was . We talked about some of the organizational issues in setting up the White House, we talked about foreign policy, we talked about domestic policy. And as I said last night, my number one priority in the coming two months is to facilitate a transition that ensures the is successful."
