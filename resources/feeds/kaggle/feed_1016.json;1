        "After US citizen Rizwan Farook and his Pakistani wife Tashfeen Malik murdered 14 people in San Bernardino on December 2, 2015, Donald Trump called for a \u201dtotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d Trump tweaked the plan, but never abandoned it. He later rephrased it as suspending \u201cimmigration from regions where vetting cannot safely occur,\u201d vowing to implement it on his first day in office. This covers immigration only, not tourist or student visas, and isn\u2019t explicitly a religious test. But everyone knows where \u201c regions\u201d are, and who lives there.",
        "The Trump administration could end an Obamacare regulation requiring all insurance plans to offer birth control \u2014 and it wouldn\u2019t even need Congress\u2019s help. Back in the summer of 2012, the Affordable Care Act mandated that insurance plans cover all contraceptives \u2014 from birth control pills to IUDs and implants \u2014 at no cost to the consumer. And it turns out this could be one of the easier parts of the Affordable Care Act for Donald Trump to repeal. He doesn\u2019t even need to send anything through Congress.",
        "When pollsters try to figure out who is winning an election, they use something called a \u201clikely voter screen. \u201d It\u2019s exactly what it sounds like \u2014 a way to sort who will actually show up on Election Day from who merely says they prefer one candidate but will probably stay home. Pollsters have different ways of building that screen. But it normally includes asking voters questions, including \u2014 beyond a direct \u201cDo you intend to vote?\u201d \u2014 whether they\u2019ve voted before and if they\u2019re registered members of a party.",
        "Before the election, a lot of people \u2014 including me \u2014 assumed that a Donald Trump win would send stocks plunging. A group of 20 Nobel Prize \u2014 winning economists warned last week that a Trump presidency could \u201cjeopardize the foundations of American prosperity and the global economy. \u201d But on Wednesday morning, the markets didn\u2019t seem very alarmed. Stocks opened the day up, and then they kept rising, ending the day up by 1. 1 percent. Evidently, Wall Street doesn\u2019t view a Trump presidency as all that alarming, at least for shareholders. So what\u2019s going on here?",
        "Seth Meyers has been a pointed voice in comedy ever since the presidential primaries started in earnest about 18 months ago (all the way back in 2015, if you can remember such a time). He took a particularly ruthless approach to covering Donald Trump, who\u2019s since gone from being roundly mocked for announcing his candidacy by gliding down an escalator in June 2015 to becoming the . It\u2019s no surprise, then, that Meyers\u2019s first monologue after the election was one of his most memorable.",
        "Thousands of protesters flooded the streets of more than a dozen American cities Wednesday night amid a wave of shock and anger over Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential election. Demonstrations have been reported in New York City, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Portland, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Oakland, Austin, Boston, and Washington, DC, among other cities. . @VanJones68 on protests: \u201dDivided America before, divided America during, divided America after.\u201d https: . \u2014 Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 (@AC360) November 10, 2016 Shortly after 9:30 pm, protesters in the nation\u2019s capital were marching toward the White House.",
        "The Republican Party, for the first time ever, has a very real shot at repealing Obamacare \u2014 and leaving tens of millions of Americans without health insurance coverage. Donald Trump has won the White House. Republicans retained control of the Senate, and they\u2019re expected to keep the House, too. One party rule means that President Obama\u2019s health care law is in real jeopardy. \u201cThey have a death blow to the Obamacare health coverage expansion,\u201d says John McDonough, a Harvard University professor who worked in the Senate on the passage of the Affordable Care Act.",
        "In 1788, Thomas Jefferson wrote that American women shouldn\u2019t \u201dwrinkle their foreheads with politics.\u201d A century and a half later, when Hillary Clinton was born, that attitude still prevailed. That year, 1947, the US had zero female senators, zero female governors. The Supreme Court, and the Oval Office of course, had only ever seen men. It was only really in the past 40 years that women learned they could lead and men learned they could be led by women.",
        "Before Tuesday night, Barack Obama was slated to become the most important American president since Ronald Reagan, a liberal icon in the mold of LBJ or FDR who deeply reshaped the federal government. Just think about everything that changed during his presidency. He signed into law a comprehensive national health insurance bill, a goal that had eluded progressive presidents for a century. He got surprisingly tough reforms to Wall Street passed as well, not to mention a stimulus package that both blunted the recession and transformed education and energy policy.",
        "Donald Trump has promised that he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case that made abortion a constitutionally protected right for American women. If he followed through on his promise, and if Roe were overturned, a woman\u2019s right to abortion would depend on which state she lived in.",
        "Wednesday morning, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine both offered subdued, classy, and conciliatory concession addresses aimed at thanking their core supporters and doing what they can to set the country up for success in the future. President Obama, too, discharged his constitutional authority to set the passionate campaign aside and begin working in a constructive way toward an orderly handover of power.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s election victory sent shockwaves through the country\u2019s Democratic strongholds, sparking dozens of rallies. Trump\u2019s response has been to take to Twitter, but instead of one message, he\u2019s sent two. On Wednesday night he sent a controversial tweet, his first tweet where he blamed the biased media and the alleged paid Democratic protesters from the primaries for trying to muddy his clear victory: Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016 Then overnight, something changed. His tone flipped.",
        "Watching the 2016 election unfold was more of an emotional roller coaster than I could have ever anticipated. As a Canadian living in Washington, DC, I can\u2019t vote in this country. Yet I\u2019ve been riding on waves of shock and despair. On Tuesday night, I saw some of my American friends who supported Hillary Clinton eat their supper, feeling hopeful, thinking it would be an early night. They were sure the Democrats would tie this one up. The minutes . .. until the moment when they realized Donald Trump could become president. The polls had been wrong.",
        "Before making sweeping statements about what Donald Trump\u2019s Election Day victory says about everyday Americans, you might want to consider one fact: Only about of Americans eligible to vote actually voted for him. According to the US Elections Project\u2019s count so far, only about 56. 9 percent of the population cast a ballot on Election Day. That means 43. 1 percent of people eligible to vote just didn\u2019t.",
        "Leonard Cohen, prolific singer, songwriter, and poet, died on Thursday at 82. The artist\u2019s career spans more than 50 years, and his songs are considered essential to the modern musical canon. His work covers all aspects of the human condition, from heartbreak to love, political unrest to peace, depression to hope. Cohen\u2019s musical career stretched from the 1960s to just this October, when he released his 14th and final album, You Want It Darker.",
        "Update: An earlier version of this article referenced a study by two political scientists, Kyle Kopko and Christopher Devine, on whether Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein\u2019s voters could have swung the election to Hillary Clinton. That study was based on incomplete data: Vote totals for Pennsylvania weren\u2019t yet final, and the final tally showed that Clinton could have won the state if she\u2019d had all of Stein\u2019s votes as well as her own. This article has been updated to reflect the final results in Pennsylvania and elsewhere.",
        "Donald Trump told the Wall Street Journal Friday that there are two parts of the Affordable Care Act he\u2019d like to keep: the ban on preexisting conditions and the provision that allows young adults to stay on their parents\u2019 coverage through age 26. Trump told the Journal, of those policies, \u201cI like those very much. \u201d That second policy is easy enough to keep running. It\u2019s a pretty simple regulation that the insurance industry has already become accustomed to. Continuing the ban on preexisting conditions is . .. not so easy.",

        "If you set out to find a serial killer based primarily on the speculation of an amateur internet forum, you might get as far as tracking down a couple of leads, but you probably wouldn\u2019t be able to dedicate your time, money, and energy to following those leads as far as you could go. And you probably wouldn\u2019t get a sweeping documentary series out of it. But that\u2019s just what Cropsey director Josh Zeman does in his new true crime series for A&E, The Killing Season, which premieres Saturday night.",
        "Understandably, this week felt like a relatively quiet one for new TV and movie trailers. There was a massive election on Tuesday, Donald Trump\u2019s stunning victory in the early hours of Wednesday, and the adjustment to that news, no matter whom you voted for. So it\u2019s not your fault if you missed the new trailers for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and Underworld: Blood Wars. In regards to the former, the crucial detail that everyone\u2019s excited about is that it features the first look at one of the movie\u2019s space fights.",
        "Movies where a large family gathers to celebrate Christmas only have to nail one scene, and Almost Christmas does, more or less. Rating 3 It\u2019s the scene at Christmas dinner where everything comes to a head. You know the one: Every member of the family has their own little storyline, and the movie brings them together and throws in a snowball effect, so the plot gets bigger and bigger and rolls faster and faster.",

        "Every four years, we elect a president in this country, and we do it in a strange way: via the Electoral College. The reasons for the Electoral College are unclear to most people. On the surface, it appears and needlessly complicated. Why not rely on a popular vote, as almost every other democracy does? If a popular vote makes sense for gubernatorial elections, why doesn\u2019t it make sense for presidential elections? What did the American founders have in mind when they erected this ostensible firewall against majority will?",
        "Tonight, the full moon will appear larger than it has since the 1940s. The moon will appear around 14 percent bigger and 30 percent brighter compared with the smallest full moons. It will be worth taking a step outside to see this super supermoon. What is a supermoon, and why does it happen? The moon\u2019s orbit around Earth is not a perfect circle. It\u2019s an ellipse, a saucer shape that\u2019s longer than it is wide. That means as the moon follows this orbit, it\u2019s sometimes closer to the Earth and sometimes farther away.",
        "In an interview with CBS\u2019s Leslie Stahl on 60 Minutes, Donald Trump said he would appoint \u201c \u201d judges to the Supreme Court \u2014 and that if Roe v. Wade were overturned, women would \u201chave to go to another state\u201d if they want an abortion. \u201cIf [Roe v. Wade] ever were overturned, it would go back to the states,\u201d Trump said. Stahl followed up: \u201cBut then some women won\u2019t be able to get an abortion?\u201d \u201cYeah, well, they\u2019ll perhaps have to go \u2014 they\u2019ll have to go to another state,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s okay?\u201d Stahl asked.",
        "Donald Trump announced Sunday that he would choose his campaign manager Stephen Bannon to serve as \u201cChief Strategist and Senior Counselor to the President,\u201d and that Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus will serve as White House chief of staff.

        "Every Sunday, we pick a new episode of the week. It could be good. It could be bad. It will always be interesting. You can read the archives here. The episode of the week for November 6 through 12, 2016, is \u201dOh, Jeez\u201d the seventh episode of the 20th season of Comedy Central\u2019s South Park. From one point of view, \u201dOh, Jeez,\u201d South Park\u2019s outing, is mildly remarkable. The episode was initially announced as \u201dThe Very First Gentleman\u201d and was presumed to pivot off of a Hillary Clinton election victory.",
        "When I go home to South Dakota to visit my family, I speak two languages. One is the language of my new home in California, of my job in the national media, a freewheeling speech that blends irony and academia and weird jokes. You\u2019re probably familiar with this language if you read a lot of internet sites. The other is the language of my youth, and its hallmark is a sincere, aching tone that longs for salvation and worries everything is about to crumble.",
        "On Friday, Donald Trump sat for an interview with the Wall Street Journal. Among the questions: Did he think the rhetoric he used on the campaign trail had gone too far? \u201cNo,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI won. \u201d Trump did win, and he did it against all odds, in spite of all predictions, and by doing things everyone told him not to do. Reality has proven him, and his instincts, right. Imagine what that\u2019s done to Trump\u2019s already healthy ego, to his preexisting belief in his excellent judgment. The Electoral College proved the doubters wrong. Why would Trump change now?",
        "Unified Republican control of the federal government over the next two years augurs a sea change in US environmental policy like nothing since the late 1960s and \u201970s, when America\u2019s landmark environmental laws were first passed. If Donald Trump and the GOP actually follow through on what they\u2019ve promised, this time around will be a lurch in the opposite direction."
