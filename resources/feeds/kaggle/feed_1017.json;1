        "PBS reporter Gwen Ifill \u2014 who died November 14 at 61 years old \u2014 was and remains greatly respected throughout the field of journalism. From beginning her career in the early 1980s as a reporter at the Baltimore Evening Sun, to covering seven separate presidential campaigns, to becoming the of PBS NewsHour in 2013, Ifill contributed over three decades of judicious, empathetic, and incisive work in media. Ifill also had the distinction of being a black woman who was a loud, prominent voice in a predominantly white, male field.",
        "On the day after the election, I reached out to my white friends. Through a series of text messages and posts, I asked them a simple question: White people: What is your plan? I know what you may be thinking. No, I am not white. It is therefore not my burden or my responsibility to expend my energy in this way, right? I know. But this message couldn\u2019t wait. I was tired of continuously being assaulted by my country, yet being the one expected to spring to action alone. It was very clear: White people handed us Donald Trump.",
        "If you take Donald Trump at his word, according to what he told 60 Minutes\u2019 Lesley Stahl in his first interview since the election, the overwhelming majority of unauthorized immigrants in the US have nothing to fear from his administration. \u201cWhat we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers,\u201d he told Stahl. Most unauthorized immigrants don\u2019t have criminal records. If the Trump administration actually limited its deportation efforts to convicted criminals, it would be more lenient than the Obama administration has ever been.",
        "During the 2016 election, Facebook showed fake news stories to millions of voters. Because these stories were disproportionately (inaccurately claiming, for example, that the Pope had endorsed Trump and that an FBI agent involved in investigating Hillary Clinton had been murdered) that has caused some people to wonder if Facebook itself had contributed to Trump\u2019s victory. On Saturday, Zuckerberg addressed his critics with a new post on Facebook.",
        "Gwen Ifill, a veteran journalist and news anchor with the Public Broadcasting Service, is dead at 61, PBS reported Monday. She died of cancer. \u201dI am very sad to tell you that our dear friend and beloved colleague Gwen Ifill passed away today in hospice care in Washington,\u201d WETA president and CEO Sharon Percy Rockefeller wrote to staff Monday, according to Politico. \u201dI spent an hour with her this morning and she was resting comfortably, surrounded by loving family and friends. . ..",
        "Donald Trump got fewer votes for president than Hillary Clinton, which means that he\u2019s our purely because of the Electoral College. And in an interview with 60 Minutes that aired Sunday, even he couldn\u2019t really defend that. Trump said that he would \u201crather see\u201d the presidential race\u2019s outcome determined by a simple popular vote. \u201cYou know, you get 100 million votes and somebody else gets 90 million votes and you win.",
        "Every episode of Gilmore Girls has a grace note. Every episode, even the very worst, has some weird, quirky jewel of a moment that makes the whole thing worth watching \u2014 even something as small as Rory casually roasting a marshmallow over her stove burner when she gets home from school, or Taylor showing off his horrible toupee. Gilmore Girls premiered on the WB in the fall of 2000, and slowly grew into a sleeper hit.",
        "Scientists are worried about a Donald Trump presidency \u2014 and with reason. Trump has bashed the National Institutes of Health. He\u2019s denied global warming. He\u2019s spread nonsense about vaccines. My colleague Brian Resnick wrote an story on this fear. But the biggest, most consequential question of all is what a Trump presidency might mean for science funding.",
        "The only certainty about the future of Obamacare right now is this: Everything is uncertain. In the 72 hours following his election, Donald Trump has made significant new statements on the Affordable Care Act. He campaigned on repealing Obamacare. But last Friday, he told the Wall Street Journal that he wants to keep the ban on preexisting conditions and continue to allow young adults to enroll in their parents\u2019 insurance plans.",
        "It\u2019s been a bad week for a lot of Americans. How about an interesting distraction? The video above, from the American Museum of Natural History, shows essentially all of human history in just six minutes. It shows humanity spreading across the world over a few hundred thousand years \u2014 even as our population remained under 1 million. After that came the rise and fall of many empires and civilizations, plagues, wars, and so on \u2014 all the way to our current population of around 7 billion.",
        "What if there were a grammar to the types of roads we drive every day? Streets, avenues, and roads aren\u2019t named at random \u2014 many use a series of conventions that, once you recognize them, becomes impossible not to see. Though some of these rules have been muddied over time, if you tour your neighborhood you may find these names are a surprisingly effective way to decode our roads. The above video takes you on a virtual tour of these roadways (and you can read a list of common road types below).",
        "Barack Obama found in 2009 that winning a presidential election is one thing but getting the United States Senate to do what you want is a rather different thing. Next year, Donald Trump will have Republican congressional majorities at his back, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the Senate will back all of his priorities. And already, as the transition enters its second week, foreign policy is emerging as a potential trouble spot for Trump. It started with Dave Weigel\u2019s report Tuesday that Sen.",
        "In 2016, researchers stumbled on a radical tactic for reducing another person\u2019s bigotry: a frank, brief conversation. The study, authored by David Broockman at Stanford University and Joshua Kalla at the University of California Berkeley, looked at how simple conversations can help combat attitudes. In the research, people canvassed the homes of more than 500 voters in South Florida. The canvassers, who could be trans or not, asked the voters to simply put themselves in the shoes of trans people \u2014 to understand their problems \u2014 through a nonconfrontational conversation.",
        "Last summer, Obamacare\u2019s future seemingly secure, longtime health advocate Ron Pollack announced he would retire in March 2017. \u201cI had expected to move on to something else, and I was looking forward to that,\u201d Pollack says. The election changed all that. Pollack has spent decades fighting for the expansion of health coverage in the United States. He is the executive director of Families USA, one of the key advocacy groups that helped pass the Affordable Care Act.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s transition team has released what it\u2019s calling a \u201cnew deal for Black America. \u201d The entertainment website MediaTakeOut published the document late last week, not long before it was announced that Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s campaign chair, editor in chief of Breitbart. com, and champion of the views of \u201c \u201d white supremacists, would become his chief strategist. Given Trump\u2019s history of expressions of racism and allegations of racial discrimination, it\u2019s unsurprising the document is both bursting with stereotypes and lacking in substance. To be clear, \u201cDonald J.",
        "After leaked audio showed Donald Trump bragging in 2005 that he can \u201cgrab [women] by the pussy\u201d and kiss them without consent because he\u2019s \u201ca star,\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign seemed done for. Many Republicans withdrew their endorsements in disgust, and those who didn\u2019t faced intense pressure to follow suit. Trump\u2019s poll numbers plummeted \u2014 and kept plummeting after women started coming forward to allege that Trump had sexually assaulted them. But then, the free fall stopped. Media attention turned back to Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails with a little over a week to go before the election.",
        "Polarization has defined American politics for several years now. More and more, it seems, Americans are divided over nearly every issue of import \u2014 race, immigration, terrorism, trade, social policy. The divisions run deep and cut across a number of cultural fault lines. Jonathan Haidt is a social psychologist at New York University and the author of The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion. Haidt\u2019s research focuses on the links between moral intuitions and political beliefs. His work is especially useful now because it explains how emotions and core value judgments drive political behavior.",
        "Here\u2019s one way to think about the 2016 election. We are witnessing a great race in this country between demographic and economic change that\u2019s driving a new America, and reaction to those changes. On November 8, with a tremendous burst of speed, reaction to change caught up with change and surpassed it. But is that advantage sustainable over the long haul, as change continues and reaction has to run ever faster simply to keep pace? Probably not. Those old legs will give out eventually, though we do not know exactly when.",
        "It\u2019s been less than a week since Donald Trump was elected president, and he\u2019s already in hot water over an appointment to his nascent administration. The controversy centers on Steve Bannon, the Trump campaign\u2019s CEO. On Sunday, the Trump team announced that Bannon would serve as the \u201cchief strategist and senior counselor\u201d in the upcoming Trump administration. It\u2019s not exactly clear what Bannon\u2019s responsibilities will be, but the press release describes the role as an \u201cequal partner\u201d to the chief of staff, typically the most powerful staff position in the White House.",
        "Like Donald Trump, Barack Obama came to the presidency after winning an underdog primary victory in which he got little party support. So when his transition began, he had to make a choice. Would he award his top jobs to the very small group of loyalists who went out on a limb for him early? Or would he cast a wider net, looking for qualified and widely respected people, both Democrats and nonpartisan figures, regardless of their loyalties in the primary? Obama chose the latter course.",
        "It\u2019s difficult to express why I enjoyed Arrival so much. In part it\u2019s because it\u2019s so gripping and but in part it\u2019s because I grew up devouring science fiction short stories, plowing through collections at the local library and subscribing to magazines like Asimov\u2019s and the Magazine of Fantasy & Science, looking for the focused bursts of novelty, imagination, and insight that could only ever really come from short speculative fiction.",
        "Julianna Goldman reported Monday evening for CBS that the transition team \u201chas asked the White House to explore the possibility of getting his children the top secret security clearances\u201d in light of their role as advisers to their father. The request is somewhat unusual since \u201cnepotism rules prevent the from hiring his kids to work in the White House.",
        "My loving parents taught me how to speak, but they also taught me silence. I only know that my father voted for Trump because my mother \u2014 a Clinton supporter \u2014 asked on the evening of November 8, hours after they voted. They had not otherwise spoken about politics during the election season. Nearly everyone I have spoken to has said that at least one of their family members voted for Trump too. Many weren\u2019t even Trump supporters; they were \u201cNever Hillarys. \u201d But that means little now that Trump is .",
        "In late 2015, Donald Trump proposed banning all Muslims from entering the US after the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California. It was a reaction that took advantage of our fears, and a religious test reminiscent of America\u2019s worst mistakes \u2014 notably the Japanese internment camps that incarcerated 110, 000 innocent Americans during World War II. This picture is haunting. But this wasn\u2019t the driving narrative we told ourselves about Trump.",
        "On Wednesday, Bernie Sanders stood with incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to announce the new leadership team of the Democratic Party, which included Democrats from across the ideological spectrum. Schumer and Durbin elected #1 and #2 to a Senate Democratic leadership team that includes Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Joe Manchin. pic. twitter. \u2014 Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) November 16, 2016 After Democrats not just lost the presidency but also failed to retake the Senate, Schumer argued that the party was largely united against Donald Trump.",
        "Donald Trump rode into office on a promise to step up scrutiny of immigrants who might come to the US to commit terrorist acts \u2014 especially Muslims. Now, thanks to transition team member and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, we\u2019re getting a sense of what that might look like. Kobach told Reuters that the Trump is considering reinstating a database of immigrants from countries \u2014 something the federal government did from 2002 to 2011. The Kobach proposal isn\u2019t the same thing as the database of Muslim US citizens that Trump briefly floated (and then walked back) last year.",
        "Donald Trump loves the idea of infrastructure. He brings it up all the time. He wants to make an infrastructure bill a priority in his first 100 days as president. And Democrats like Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have said they\u2019d love to work with him on this. \u201dWe are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals,\u201d Trump promised cheering supporters on election night. \u201dWe\u2019re going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none.",
        "News stories are supposed to help ordinary voters understand the world around them. But in the 2016 election, news stories online too often had the opposite effect. Stories rocketed around the internet that were misleading, sloppily reported, or in some cases totally made up. Over the course of 2016, Facebook users learned that the pope endorsed Donald Trump (he didn\u2019t) that a Democratic operative was murdered after agreeing to testify against Hillary Clinton (it never happened) that Bill Clinton raped a girl (a total fabrication) and many other totally bogus \u201cnews\u201d stories.",
        "Something extraordinary happened in rural America in the 2016 election. Donald Trump appealed to folks in rural communities in an unprecedented way \u2014 yet polls failed to capture the depth of support for him in such places. Many pundits have since taken stabs at explaining the problem, yet little of the commentary is rooted in actual research. I did not predict the result of the presidential race, nor did I embark on the research project that resulted in the book The Politics of Resentment with presidential politics in mind.",
        "Donald Trump made an \u201cunusual degree\u201d of blatantly false and misleading statements for a presidential candidate. And since taking the oath of office, he\u2019s continued the pattern. He\u2019s insisted that million votes were cast illegally despite any credible evidence. He\u2019s repeated faulty statistics like the murder rate is at a high. His team has deployed \u201calternative facts\u201d about the crowd size at his inauguration, and terrorist massacres that never took place. There are the small falsehoods, too: Trump said 109 people were stopped for additional screening on the day his immigration executive order went into effect."
