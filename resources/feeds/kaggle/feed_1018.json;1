        "Every year, the National Book Foundation nominates 20 books \u2014 five fiction, five nonfiction, five poetry, five young adult \u2014 for the National Book Award, which celebrates the best of American literature. And every year (okay, every year since 2014) we here at Vox read all 20 finalists to help you smart, busy people figure out which ones you\u2019re interested in. Our thoughts on the 2016 nominees are below, with the winners noted in bold.",
        "With the Trump administration working to finalize its choices for who will run the Pentagon and State Department, it\u2019s becoming clear that getting top national security posts in the new White House requires two qualifications: intense personal loyalty to Donald Trump himself and an almost obsessive fixation on the potential threats posed by radical Islamic terrorism. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former US Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton are currently the top two contenders to be Trump\u2019s secretary of state, according to multiple media reports. Retired Lt. Gen.",
        "When he\u2019s president, Donald Trump will fly on Air Force One. Which means the Boeing 757 that Trump owns through a holding company will be free for use by Ivanka, Melania, Eric, Donald Jr. or whomever else. And if Trump requests Secret Service protection for those people, he will probably get it. And when Secret Service agents fly alongside a protectee, they use their budget to pay airfare. Which in the case of a flight on the Trump jet would mean paying Trump for the seats on his plane.",
        "Within a week of the US electing a president who has vowed to overturn Roe v. Wade, two CW shows \u2014 Jane the Virgin and Crazy \u2014 demonstrated that the right to choose might at least remain alive and well in fiction. These two shows accomplished a feat that is vanishingly rare on network television: They each let one of their female characters get an abortion. And they both took the position that the abortion was not harrowing or traumatizing, but simply the right choice for each character. Neither show did a Very Special Episode about abortion.",
        "House Democrats have agreed to delay their election for leadership posts until after November 30, setting the stage for a challenge to longtime caucus leader Nancy Pelosi and potentially other members of the leadership team. The decision is being presented by Pelosi and other senior Democrats as a \u201cconsensus\u201d move, which was described to me by one staffer for a proponent of the delay as \u201chorseshit.",
        "One of the great paradoxes of the 2016 presidential election is that whatever you make of the course of the American economy, it was the best year of the 21st century in basic pocketbook terms by almost any measure. And thanks to Donald Trump winning the election, Republicans are suddenly noticing: This kind of comically large impact is why you can\u2019t take poll respondents at their word when they explain to you how they voted.",
        "Retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn was fired from his last job in the military, sat next to Russian President Vladimir Putin after giving a paid speech in Moscow, called for Hillary Clinton to be imprisoned, and said President Obama was a \u201cliar\u201d with no plan for defeating ISIS. As of Thursday, there\u2019s something new to say about him: Flynn will be moving into the West Wing as Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser.",
        "The country has entered a dangerous period. The is the least qualified man to ever hold high office. He also operated the least transparent campaign of the modern era. He gave succor and voice to bigoted elements on a scale not seen in two generations. He openly praised dictators \u2014 not as allies but as dictators \u2014 and threatened to use the powers of his office to discipline the media. He also has a long history of corrupt behavior, and his business holdings pose staggering conflicts of interest that are exacerbated by his lack of financial disclosure.",
        "Stephen Bannon, the CEO of media outlet Breitbart News and Donald Trump\u2019s newly named chief strategist, believes we are in the midst of a crisis \u2014 of both global economy and moral standing. Godlessness and libertarianism has \u201csapped the strength of the West to defend its ideals,\u201d and the Muslim world is growing in numbers, Bannon told a conference at the Vatican in 2014.",
        "Younger members of the House Democratic caucus wanted to delay leadership elections to see if a strong challenger to Nancy Pelosi would emerge, and lo and behold, one has \u2014 Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan. Ryan is a white man from Youngstown who represents a somewhat congressional district that includes large numbers of African Americans and white voters. His political profile leans toward populism on economic issues \u2014 especially trade \u2014 but he is more on the moderate side of things in terms of environmental and social issues.",
        "Eggplant. Cilantro. Theater kids. The world is full of polarizing things that humanity will never agree on. Some of those emotions are irrational, while others are based in fact (eggplant, theater kids). And the most divisive object in United States right now might be a safety pin.",
        "It\u2019s hard to generalize about teen comedies, but some of the most are marked by the feeling that the teens are the smart ones and the adults are goobers. Rating 4 The Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off are tinged with magical realism, seen through the eyes of the teen who\u2019s got the \u2019 number; Heathers (1988) is a very dark comedy with the trappings of a revenge thriller, and the adults are basically nowhere to be seen.",
        "I\u2019m hurting, and I\u2019m tired, and I\u2019m not surprised. And I\u2019m one of the people who will be relatively okay in this new old America. All my papers are in order. I\u2019m a heterosexual man. I\u2019m black, yes, but I\u2019m also privileged. I have a fancy degree and fancy friends and global access to what\u2019s passing for a new economy and a skepticism about America\u2019s greatness, all of which gives me a certain amount of protection.",
        "If there\u2019s one thing Republicans have been clear about for the past six years, it is that the top of their agenda includes repealing Obamacare. But Obamacare repeal would leave an estimated 22 million Americans without coverage and wreak havoc on the individual insurance market. It\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that Republicans can\u2019t just repeal Obamacare \u2014 they need to replace it with something. It turns out Republicans have a lot of choices: There are at least seven different replacement plans that Republican legislators and conservative think tanks have offered in recent years.",
        "The dwarf planet Pluto orbits at the edge of our solar system, 3. 67 billion miles from the sun, where temperatures on its surface can plummet to minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Yet even in that cold, dark region of space, scientists speculate the planet may have an ocean of liquid water, or slushy ice, just beneath its surface. \u201cWe expected that Pluto would be full of surprises, but this one knocked our socks off,\u201d says Richard Binzel, an MIT professor who has been studying the dwarf planet since the 1980s.",
        "MOSCOW \u2014 The Russian parliament burst into applause when it was announced that Donald Trump had won the US presidency, and nationalist faction leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky bought 132 bottles of champagne to toast the victory. \u201cRussia is ready and wants a restoration of relations with the United States,\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Russian state television. Putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Trump. On Monday, he spoke with Trump by phone about \u201cconstructive cooperation on the widest spectrum of issues,\u201d according to the Kremlin.",
        "During the presidential campaign season, there were scattered, alarming news reports of harassment that echoed Donald Trump\u2019s stump speech rhetoric \u2014 white students chanting, \u201cBuild the wall,\u201d during a basketball game against a predominantly Latino high school, or racist graffiti, for example. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, starting the day after the election, these incidents skyrocketed. Combing through news reports, social media anecdotes, and direct submissions to the SPLC database, the organization\u2019s staff has collected 867 reports of hateful intimidation and harassment between November 9 and November 29.",
        "Two months ago, I interviewed writer and blogger Andrew Sullivan, who had just written a lengthy essay for New York magazine about our modern \u201cdistraction sickness. \u201d The conversation orbited around a single theme: attentiveness. \u201cYou are where your attention is,\u201d Sullivan told me, and, as it happens, our attention is nowhere and everywhere at once. Ads, smartphones, apps, social media, the internet \u2014 we\u2019re captive to an endless parade of distractions. Sullivan\u2019s meditation touched a nerve, but it was hardly the whole story.",
        "Donald Trump has tapped Republican Rep. Mike Pompeo of Kansas to head the Central Intelligence Agency, putting a hawkish lawmaker who favors brutally interrogating detainees and expanding the American prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in charge of America\u2019s premier spy agency. Pompeo may be an unfamiliar name to many Americans, but he is \u2014 and apparently generally \u2014 among intelligence professionals and by his colleagues on Capitol Hill.",
        "If there was ever any doubt on where President Donald Trump will take the country on issues like civil rights, criminal justice, and immigration, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions\u2019s nomination for attorney general \u2014 confirmed by the Senate, mostly along party lines, on Wednesday \u2014 should put all of those doubts to an end. On all of these issues, Sessions has been extremely conservative. He\u2019s opposed reforms to reduce mass incarceration, proposed stringent crackdowns on immigration, and he even has a history of racist remarks that ended his hopes of a federal judgeship.",
        "In the days since November 9, an oppressive cloak of fear and dread has descended upon a great many Americans. The causes are endless: Our government is at risk of becoming \u201csystemically corrupt\u201d under Donald Trump. Muslims are wondering if they\u2019ll be subject to new discriminatory scrutiny. The emboldening of white nationalist groups and the appointment of their hero Steve Bannon to a top White House post has people of color bracing for fresh hate. Immigrants protected under DACA fear the total upheaval of their lives. People who get health insurance through Obamacare face the prospect of losing it.",
        "If there\u2019s one thing Republicans have been clear about for the past six years, it is that the top of their agenda includes repealing Obamacare. But Obamacare repeal would leave 22 million Americans without coverage and wreak havoc on the individual insurance market.

        "During his successful run for the presidency, Donald Trump stuck to one simple message: Americans were getting raw deals both domestically and abroad, and he\u2019d be able to craft better ones. High on his list of purportedly bungled agreements? The landmark deal that the Obama administration and its allies struck with Iran in 2015 that called for lifting punishing Western economic sanctions in exchange for Tehran curbing its nuclear program. Trump has derided the agreement as \u201cthe stupidest deal of all time,\u201d one that will \u201cgive Iran, absolutely, nuclear weapons.",
        "The Republican Party won the presidency and both houses of Congress in the 2016 elections. So you might think that President Donald Trump will be able to do whatever he wants. But there\u2019s a catch \u2014 the United States Senate. There are many reasons the Senate is to resist Trump, if it should choose to do so. The chamber\u2019s terms help insulate it from public opinion swings. Many senators in both parties have their own strong views on policy and don\u2019t view themselves as mere partisan foot soldiers.",
        "Every single state that elected a Republican senator this November voted for Donald Trump \u2014 and every single state that elected a Democratic senator voted for Hillary Clinton. That\u2019s a first in American history \u2014 at least going back to 1913, when the Constitution began mandating the direct popular election of senators. And it\u2019s a dramatic reversal from much of the middle of the 20th century, when voters frequently backed senators of one party while also supporting the opposing party\u2019s presidential nominee \u2014 a phenomenon known as \u201cticket splitting. \u201d year. 100% were on Nov.",
        "Republicans are coalescing around a plan to repeal Obamacare \u2014 and set up a deadline, three years in the future, to pass a replacement plan. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a transition now that we actually have a president who\u2019s likely to sign the repeal into the law. People are being, understandably cautious, to make sure nobody\u2019s dropped through the cracks,\u201d Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn ( ) told Politico. The idea, politically, makes sense. Republicans can quickly make good on their promise to repeal Obamacare, and then get to the hard work of actually figuring out what should come next.",
        "Donald Trump has said he would repeal Obamacare. But he wants to keep some parts, like forcing insurance companies to insure people with preexisting conditions. This sounds like a compromise. It even sounds like good news that insurance plans will no longer be able to deny coverage to sick people. But here\u2019s the thing: Taking out that single piece would likely cause the entire system to collapse. This cartoon explains why: Let\u2019s start with 10 people, some sick and some healthy. Before Obamacare, insurance companies could refuse to give insurance to people who were too sick.",
        "The New Yorker\u2019s David Remnick has a long, powerful piece called \u201cObama Reckons With A Trump Presidency. \u201d It\u2019s the most insight we\u2019re going to get into President Obama\u2019s reaction to Donald Trump\u2019s ascension, and it\u2019s worth considering carefully. Remnick was with Obama before, during, and after the election, and you can tell the reporting began in a very different place than it ended. Remnick probably thought he would record Obama\u2019s reflections as he prepared to turn power over to Hillary Clinton, his chosen successor.",
        "Here are a few news stories that broke between the time I left work a little early on Friday afternoon and the time my toddler went down for his midday nap on Saturday: Foreign diplomats are booking rooms at Donald Trump\u2019s hotel in Washington, DC because they believe that directly putting money in the pocket of the of the United States will serve as a bribe that helps them curry favor with him and influence foreign policy. Congress\u2019s phones got jammed by citizens calling in and asking members to do something about Donald Trump\u2019s financial conflicts of interest.",
        "Donald Trump boasted for years \u2014 including on the campaign trail \u2014 about how he \u201cnever\u201d settled lawsuits. That wasn\u2019t always true. But the announcement Friday that he\u2019d settled for $25 million the three lawsuits against Trump University, his ersatz university accused of defrauding students, was still a little out of character for a man who brags about never backing down. And while Trump didn\u2019t admit liability in the settlement, the facts about Trump\u2019s real estate seminars that emerged during the proceedings were damning. Trump University wasn\u2019t a \u201cuniversity\u201d at all, but a series of real estate seminars."
