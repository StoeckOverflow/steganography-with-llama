        "This time it\u2019s not Megyn Kelly, the bereaved father of an Army captain, or a former Miss Universe contestant. No, Donald Trump\u2019s latest Twitter feud is with the cast of Hamilton \u2014 the Broadway musical that has taken the world by storm. Hamilton\u2019s cast delivered a personal message to Vice Mike Pence, who attended the musical Friday night and was booed by the theater audience, making a case for diversity and inclusivity. But rather than hearing the plea, Trump demanded an apology: Our wonderful future V. P.",
        "Homeopathy is one of the most enduring forms of snake oil available to consumers; it has been duping people since 1814. But the United States government only recently decided to clamp down on these bogus treatments, with a new policy from the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC\u2019s policy statement explains that the agency will now ask that the makers of homeopathic drugs present reliable scientific evidence for their health claims if they want to sell them to consumers on the US market. Mustering that evidence is likely to be difficult given that homeopathy is a pseudoscience.",
        "After walking away from The Daily Show in August 2015, Jon Stewart popped up throughout the election like the ghost of political comedy past. He haunted his friends\u2019 shows \u2014 Full Frontal With Samantha Bee, The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, the late Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore \u2014 with a newly gray beard and a hangdog expression that seemed equal parts exhausted by the news and relieved that he doesn\u2019t have to cover it daily anymore.",
        "Donald Trump unveiled a new office this weekend that will have the \u201csweeping authority to overhaul the federal bureaucracy,\u201d the Washington Post reports. Heading this new shop is a man with no experience in government, politics, or public policy \u2014 Ivanka Trump\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner. This week, Kushner will also be meeting with the Senate Intelligence Committee as part of its investigation into Russian meddling in 2016 election. To understand Kushner\u2019s prominence in the administration, think of Trump\u2019s staffing as a stool.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s shocking victory on Election Day has left many people, particularly minority Americans, reeling: How could so much of the country hate us \u2014 or at least not care enough for us \u2014 to vote for a man who ran a campaign that repeatedly insulted minority Americans, even going as far as proposing policies that explicitly target them?",
        "This summer, Sen. Bill Cassidy ( ) and Rep. Pete Sessions ( ) introduced the The World\u2019s Greatest Health Care Plan (that is the real name) a bill that aims to replace Affordable Care Act. The bill is among more than a Republican proposals on the subject \u2014 and this Monday morning, Sen. Cassidy and I got to discuss it in depth. The bill has some similarities to other Republican plans: It includes tax credits to make insurance more affordable, with the most generous tax credits going to older Americans who typically face higher premiums.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s victory over Hillary Clinton came as a shock to many \u2014 and for many women who opposed Trump in particular, Clinton\u2019s loss was personally devastating. But after the election, desperation and fear swelled into a plan for action: a \u201cWomen\u2019s March on Washington\u201d on January 21, the day after Trump\u2019s inauguration and the first full day of his administration. What started as a viral idea on social media has snowballed into what could be the biggest mass mobilization yet that America has seen in response to a presidential inauguration.",
        "Jared Taylor, the editor of the white nationalist journal American Renaissance, believes African Americans are threat to American society. \u201cWhen blacks are left entirely to their own devices, Western civilization \u2014 any kind of civilization \u2014 disappears,\u201d he wrote in 2005. He believes the chief goal of immigration policy should be \u201cto keep the country . \u201d He is a leading figure in the the racist online movement that vocally backed the Trump campaign. So when I called Taylor after the election, I expected to him to be excited by the results.",
        "Fake news has dominated the real news lately, identified as one of the potential causes for the November surprise of Donald Trump\u2019s Electoral College victory. As numerous stories have discussed, a wave of fake news sites cropped up over the past year to spread sensationalized false information via social media, most of which seem driven by the promise of quick profits in exchange for generating clickbait more than ideological subterfuge.",
        "Vice Mike Pence was supposed to have a quiet night at the theater on Friday when he went to see Hamilton. But after Pence was greeted by boos from the audience and an impassioned speech from the actor Brandon Dixon (who plays eventual Vice President Aaron Burr) Donald Trump turned the incident into a news story. Pence ended up getting asked about it when he appeared on Fox News Sunday; calls to #BoycottHamilton from Trump supporters were trending all weekend on Twitter. Philosophically, it\u2019s an ironic twist.",
        "What if the push against \u201cnormalizing\u201d the potential horrors of a Trump administration ends up making the actual administration seem better by comparison? In the 10 days since Donald Trump was elected to the presidency, critics \u2014 liberal and conservative alike \u2014 of Donald Trump and his inner circle have warned that his presidency will violate, undermine, and permanently weaken democratic norms. Comparisons have been made to the rise of Putinist autocracy in Russia (here at Vox and elsewhere) to the slow descent of Turkey into authoritarianism under Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to Nazi Germany.",
        "Donald Trump will not stop tweeting about Hamilton, and about how \u201cvery rude and insulting\u201d the cast was to urge Vice Michael Pence to protect and defend all the diverse citizens of America after their curtain call on Friday night. As my colleague Matthew Yglesias has already pointed out, of all the things that Trump did this weekend, the Hamilton mess is one of the least immediately consequential. It has nothing on the immense financial corruption in which the Trump administration is already enmeshed before Trump even takes office.",
        "The first time I saw somebody walking down the street talking on a cellphone, I thought he was mentally ill. I was in New York City in the late \u201990s, and people there were a little ahead of the curve, on slick handheld cellphones and Bluetooths. He was shaking his head from side to side, waving his hands and stomping while he spoke, as if he were talking to an invisible person right in front of him. The more I looked around that day, the more I realized that lots of other people were doing the same thing.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s newly appointed national security adviser, retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, doesn\u2019t control the nation\u2019s military, like the secretary of defense. He doesn\u2019t tell America\u2019s diplomats what messages to pass to foreign leaders, like the secretary of state. And he doesn\u2019t tell US spies which governments to infiltrate or which terror leaders to target, like the director of the CIA. Flynn\u2019s powers are less tangible, but his role is critically important all the same.",
        "Here at Vox, we write lots of stories about the laws and policies that pass in Washington. We\u2019re covering the new Obamacare debate with great fervor \u2014 and keeping a close eye on how a President Donald Trump might change immigration laws in the United States. What we and other Washington reporters are less good at is explaining what happens afterward \u2014 how policy can have interesting, unexpected, and important effects on all of our lives. A few months ago, two of us began dreaming up a new podcast to help change that.",
        "The player piano in the Sweetwater tavern, a central location in Westworld, has always been a bit of a mystery. It plays cleverly anachronistic music that wouldn\u2019t be available on a player piano in the Old West: rock and pop from the 1960s onward. And while the metaphor is obvious (a robotic device only able to play whatever \u201ccode\u201d it\u2019s fed) at times it\u2019s seemed as if the piano is another trigger for Host behavior, like some of the code words Ford and the others use to control their creations.",
        "More Americans voted for Hillary Clinton than for Donald Trump. More Americans voted for Democratic Senate candidates than for Republican Senate candidates. So why aren\u2019t Democrats acting like it? Why aren\u2019t they trying to force Republicans, the media, and the emergent Trump White House to act like it? This is not an argument that the election was rigged, or that Trump\u2019s win is somehow illegitimate. The president is chosen by the Electoral College. The Senate is built to favor small states. Gerrymandering is legal. America does not decide national elections by simply tallying up votes.",
        "Donald Trump has won the White House. But it\u2019s Republicans who have won Congress, and it\u2019s House Speaker Paul Ryan who, in practice, leads those Republicans. And so for all the effort being made to divine what Trump really, truly thinks, the reality is it may matter less than what Ryan thinks \u2014 and that\u2019s a question we already know the answer to. Ryan has spent the better part of a decade crafting a coherent, sweeping agenda to reform and slash the American safety net.",
        "On Tuesday, Donald Trump sat down with reporters, editors, and management of the New York Times. Since the hasn\u2019t held a traditional press conference since being elected, this meeting was the closest he\u2019s come to fielding questions from many angles at once and without preparation. Much of the meeting, as by Times reporters Maggie Haberman and Mike Grynbaum, was typical Trump bluster and whining; Trump reportedly started the meeting with four solid minutes of complaints about how \u201cunfair\u201d the Times had been to him.",
        "For decades, political scientists thought they knew how kids developed their political beliefs: They mimicked their parents. After all, the data showed that most children end up having the same political leanings as their parents. But the problem with this model is that it assumes children know what their parents\u2019 politics are \u2014 and that they usually accept those beliefs. This model didn\u2019t sit right with political scientist Christopher Ojeda because it didn\u2019t treat children as \u201dindependent and critical thinkers.\u201d So he and fellow political scientist Peter K.",
        "Forest managers have never seen anything like it. Across California, an astounding 102 million trees have died over the past six years from drought and disease \u2014 including 62 million trees in 2016 alone, the US Forest Service estimates. oaks and pines have faded into ghastly hues of brown and gray. The biggest worry is that these dead, dry forests will become highly combustible when California\u2019s annual fire season rolls around next summer.",
        "When considering a carton of ice cream, most people aren\u2019t thinking about how it got on the shelf. But behind each freezer door is a secondary market that determines what you have the option to buy. \u201cSlotting fees\u201d (or \u201cslotting allowances\u201d) are fees that manufacturers pay retailers to appear on their scarce shelves. It can cost millions of dollars to launch a product in the nation\u2019s groceries, and through that cost, these fees shape our supermarkets and diets long before we\u2019re able to make a purchase decision ourselves.",
        "Deep frying a turkey, it turns out, isn\u2019t the most dangerous Thanksgiving activity. Instead, federal data shows that the most emergency room admissions are from those who have mishaps with a knife. Thanks to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) we have data on emergency room visits at about 100 hospitals, and of the more than 358, 000 recorded visits in 2015, 47 involved injuries. injuries is thankfully low, but of those 47 ER visits, nearly half involved a knife.",
        "The 2018 congressional elections will give Democrats their best shot at cutting into the Republican Party\u2019s complete control on the federal government. But the fight over who will lead that effort \u2014 over who will be the Democrats\u2019 against Donald Trump \u2014 is being waged right now in the halls of Congress. Last week, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan announced that he\u2019s running against Nancy Pelosi for House minority leader. It\u2019s a bid.",
        "Whether or not Moana (pronounced ) is the movie we need right now I can\u2019t say definitively, but I think it was the movie I needed. And I suspect I won\u2019t be alone in that feeling. Rating 4 A tale of a courageous young woman who learns to lead from her ancestors and takes on a lava monster, Moana has a lot things going for it. Its sunny island setting lends itself to magical realism to great effect, similar to this year\u2019s outstanding Kubo and the Two Strings.",
        "In May 2007, a young reporter named Rory Gilmore took a bus from Connecticut to Iowa to start her very first job in journalism, covering the presidential campaign of Sen. Barack Obama for a small online outlet. To those who knew her, it must have come as a surprise. Rory had always been a Hillary Clinton supporter, and was even planning on writing her application essay to Harvard on Clinton before someone told her just how common a subject Clinton was.",
        "When it comes to trade with China, Donald Trump has made some audacious promises. In language laced with unsubtle nods to Chinese stereotypes, the has pledged to crack down on the country\u2019s \u201ccheating\u201d in its trade practices with the US \u2014 something he claims has resulted in \u201cthe greatest theft in the history of the world. \u201d Trump\u2019s proposed solution? To label China a \u201ccurrency manipulator\u201d on day one of his presidency, and to slap massive 45 percent tariffs on the goods it sends to the United States.",
        "A few years ago, Bitcoin advocates were touting its potential to transform the financial sector. \u201cWhat would happen if you and I could just exchange money without it ever going through a bank?\u201d venture capitalist and early Bitcoin supporter Marc Andreessen asked me in a 2014 interview. Bitcoin could render banks obsolete much as the internet had rendered newspapers and record stores irrelevant, optimists thought. Eventually, the industry could be rebuilt with Bitcoin as its new foundation. I was one of the people who thought this vision was plausible.",
        "A brutal war in Syria that has killed more than 400, 000 people and sparked a refugee crisis of literally historic proportions. An increasingly aggressive Russia using its military strength to annex parts of other countries. A bloody war in Yemen that has put millions of people on the brink of starvation. A volatile and belligerent dictator with nuclear weapons in North Korea. Escalating tensions between the United States and China over territorial disputes in the East and South China Seas.",
        "Election Day was more than two weeks ago, but votes are still being tallied in the North Carolina governor\u2019s race, which has become the subject of intense partisan controversy, apparently baseless allegations of voter fraud, and even speculation about a possible from the legislature. Though Republicans won both the presidential and Senate contests in the Tar Heel State, the incumbent Republican governor, Pat McCrory, is currently trailing his challenger, Attorney General Roy Cooper (D) in the vote count."
