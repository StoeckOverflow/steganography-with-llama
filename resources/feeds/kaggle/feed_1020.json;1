        "Earlier this year, US intelligence agencies blamed the Russian government for leaking emails stolen from senior Democrats in an attempt to influence the US election. We also know that someone \u2014 likely the Russian government \u2014 tried to hack voting infrastructure in Ukraine to change the outcome of the election there. So could the Russian government have used its hacking capabilities to directly modify the results of the 2016 election in the United States? It\u2019s a serious possibility \u2014 serious enough that US election officials should be on their guard against it.",
        "Here\u2019s a question that seems particularly relevant as we head into holiday season 2016: In the wake of such a vituperative election, how do you possibly discuss politics with loved ones you might disagree with on just about everything, without wanting to kill each other? I\u2019ll be the first to admit there\u2019s no easy answer. I recently wrote a whole piece on why progressives should work harder to express their values to folks in rural areas, without ever addressing the question of how to do that. Many of us are just giving up.",
        "Thich Nhat Hanh is one of the world\u2019s most renowned Buddhist leaders, second only to the Dalai Lama in fame and influence. With his 100+ books, he\u2019s been an advocate for mindfulness at some of the most fractious moments of the past 50 years. He cut his teeth doing human rights and reconciliation work during the Vietnam War, and then was nominated for a Nobel Prize by Martin Luther King Jr. These days, he\u2019s considered the father of \u201cengaged Buddhism.",
        "A federal judge has blocked a new Department of Labor regulation that would have made millions of workers eligible for overtime pay. The rule was scheduled to take effect on December 1 and it was expected to be a key part of President Barack Obama\u2019s economic legacy. The law gives workers making less than $47, 476 a right to overtime pay. The old rule had applied only to workers making less than $23, 660 per year.",
        "Donald Trump isn\u2019t just vowing to dismantle US climate policies as president. His transition team is potentially considering major changes to NASA\u2019s climate science programs. In an interview with the Guardian, Bob Walker, a former congressman and Trump\u2019s space policy adviser, said he\u2019d like to shrink NASA\u2019s programs going forward. \u201cWe see NASA in an exploration role, in deep space research,\u201d he said. \u201c science is better placed at other agencies where it is their prime mission.",
        "Donald Trump was very explicit during the presidential campaign that one of his first acts in office would be to initiate the complete repeal of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 something Republican Congress has been itching to do for years. Repealing Obamacare, however, with neither eliminate nor bypass the central challenge of health care, which can be gleaned from the chart below. That challenge will persist regardless of whether the Republicans quickly settle on an alternative plan, or if they repeal without a replacement.",
        "One of the most puzzling injustices in American history is our tradition of eating turkey, a bird that excels in its mediocrity, on the best holiday this great nation has to offer. For generations and generations, Americans have gathered together on Thanksgiving with their families and friends to celebrate what they\u2019re grateful for: life, love, friendship, employment, a favorite sports team, and whatever else. And they show their appreciation by consuming a dish that, despite requiring prep and cooking time longer than some human labors, frequently tastes like a chicken that didn\u2019t try hard enough.",
        "Prior to Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory, if you asked the average person to explain the \u201c\u201d their response \u2014 assuming they\u2019d heard of the \u2014 was likely to involve internet trolls. Before the movement became more widely known for and white supremacism, its members were frequently described as internet trolls. But in the wake of Trump\u2019s ascent to the White House and many subsequent public displays of behavior in celebration of it, many people are asking whether \u201ctrolling\u201d was ever the correct term to describe the \u2019s behavior.",
        "If there\u2019s any part of the research enterprise that can elicit rage amongst scientists, it\u2019s peer review. Academics vet the work of their peers \u2014 for free, in their spare time \u2014 in a process that is supposed to weed out junk science before it\u2019s published. But researchers say the task is thankless, that it slows down the publication process. To make matters worse, this cornerstone of the scientific method has surprisingly little evidence for its effectiveness, and many mysteries about how it works.",
        "After Hillary Clinton\u2019s devastating election loss, the Democratic Party has naturally been doing a lot of soul searching over how it can do better. One particularly fraught debate has been over how, or even whether, liberals and progressives should reach out to white voters who favored Donald Trump this November. Sen. Bernie Sanders chose to frame that debate this way: \u201cOne of the struggles that you\u2019re going to be seeing in the Democratic Party is whether we go beyond identity politics,\u201d Sanders said in Boston on Sunday.",
        "Over the past 24 hours, we\u2019ve seen more and more liberals calling for a recount of the election in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, the three swing states whose electoral votes delivered the presidency to Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton could call for a recall in those states, but so far she\u2019s shown no interest in doing so. But Clinton isn\u2019t the only candidate on the ballot in those states. On Wednesday afternoon, Green Party candidate Jill Stein announced that she was interested in seeking a recount, and launched a fundraising drive to help fund the effort.",
        "For US airlines, this Thanksgiving holiday may be the busiest in history: a record 27 million people have flights booked between November 18 and 29. Typically, Thanksgiving travel picks up steam two days before the holiday, then peaks on the day before, as young adults scramble to make it home in time for grandma\u2019s cranberry sauce. Unfortunately, not all airports are equally equipped to handle this massive influx in traffic, and flight delays during Thanksgiving are quite common. Below are the 50 worst airports, according to the total percentage of all flights that are historically delayed.",
        "Winter weather is descending upon Standing Rock, North Dakota, where thousands of indigenous people and allies have gathered to resist construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Undersupplied and facing the prospect of a Trump administration, the water protectors, as they call themselves, face a gloomy season ahead after seven months of protest. Energy Transfers Partners, the developers of the pipeline, have met fierce resistance from the Standing Rock Sioux. The tribe says the pipeline, which comes quite close to their land, has the potential to burst or leak, therefore poisoning their water supply.",
        "Hedge funds are essentially defined by their ability to slip through the cracks of the American financial regulatory system. They don\u2019t do banking, so they don\u2019t need a license from a bank regulator. They don\u2019t underwrite securities, so they don\u2019t warrant scrutiny from market regulators. And they aren\u2019t open to the mass public, so they evade consumer protection regulation too.",
        "Science fiction is never really about the future; it\u2019s always about us. And Arrival, set in the barely distant future, feels like a movie for 2016, dropping into theaters mere days after the most explosive election in most of the American electorate\u2019s memory. Rating 4. 5 But the story Arrival is based on \u2014 the novella Story of Your Life by Ted Chiang \u2014 was published in 1998, almost two decades ago, which indicates its central themes were brewing long before this year.",
        "My father grew up in South Boston, and most of his family still lives near there. I grew up listening to my uncles and grandparents speak in thick accents about pahking the cah, about welding and wiring, about working on the Big Dig. Both of my dad\u2019s brothers ride Harleys. His twin brother has a spider web tattooed on his elbow. We\u2019re all Red Sox fans. Rating 5 I love my father\u2019s family. They are boisterous and even when they\u2019re fighting. But you\u2019d hardly call them emotionally open.",
        "We all know who won the presidential election according to the Electoral College: Donald Trump. And we all know who won the presidential election by popular vote: Hillary Clinton. But who would have won if the US used instant runoff voting, a kind of ranked voting system utilized in Australia, Ireland, and San Francisco, and which Maine just voted to adopt for all its elections? To find out, I teamed up with David Shor, a senior data scientist at Civis Analytics, a Democratic data and polling firm formed by veterans of the 2012 Obama campaign (like Shor).",
        "On Election Day, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign was confident she would win. Almost every poll and projection confirmed it. The numbers had looked good for Clinton for months; it would be an early victory, with a strong electoral map \u2014 maybe even a blowout. The party was planned: She would stand on a blue stage shaped like the United States in the Javits Center, a glass building \u2014 a nod to the glass ceiling Clinton would be shattering. But there was no celebration that night. She lost states her campaign was all but certain she would win.",
        "The further we get from the 1965 debut of A Charlie Brown Christmas, one scene in particular seems stranger and stranger. It\u2019s the one where Charlie Brown and Linus go to purchase a Christmas tree for the kids\u2019 Christmas pageant. At the giant Christmas tree lot, searchlights beam into the sky, and the trees plunked upon the ground are every color but green. Pinks and oranges and purples dominate the horizon, and the two little boys look for something real in the din. At one point, Linus knocks on a tree to hear the hollow clang of metal.",
        "Fidel Castro is dead. In practical terms, it\u2019s doubtful this will change much \u2014 either for Cubans domestically or for Cuba\u2019s place in the world. Castro handed the reins over to his younger brother Ra\u00fal a decade ago, and while it\u2019s possible that his brother\u2019s passing will free up Ra\u00fal to make changes, so far the brothers have pursued broadly similar policies. If anything, the election of Donald Trump, who has criticized the recent deal to normalize relations, could prove more consequential to the lives of ordinary Cubans than Castro\u2019s death.",
        "Weeks before the Election Day, when he still assumed Hillary Clinton would be his successor, Barack Obama told historian Doris Kearns Goodwin that he would be an activist tackling unspecified challenges \u201cthat in some ways I suspect I\u2019m able to do better out of this office. \u201d The restraints and obligations of the office, he explained, had sometimes prevented him from pursuing \u201cwhat I believe would move the ball down the field on the issues I care most deeply about.",
        "Early in Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) is trying to answer a phone call, with little success. Could it be \u2014 as her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham) surmises \u2014 because the little burg of Stars Hollow, Connecticut, where the pair resides, has bad reception due to the giant snow globe it exists within? Rating 3. 5 It\u2019s a joke, of course. Gilmore Girls is not revealed, at least at this juncture, to be a stealth sequel to Under the Dome.",
        "After years of avoiding assassination attempts by the US government, Fidel Castro died at age 90 on Friday, at the end of a decade of dealing with illness. Castro\u2019s longevity may even seem like the final act of defiance against the United States, which become his adversary since he first took power in Cuba in the late 1950s. The botched 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion meant to topple Castro could\u2019ve ended in his death, but most other attempts involved more subterfuge and spycraft.",
        "Donald Trump took some time off from staffing his White House and enjoying Thanksgiving to go on a series of Twitter rampages this weekend. The proximate cause of his rage is the movement for audits of the vote in a few key states \u2014 an effort he derided as, well, \u201cSad!\u201d But his anger took a darker turn on Sunday afternoon, when he blasted out this missive: In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally \u2014 Donald J.",
        "Apple did something extraordinarily unusual today and talked extensively about a product that it\u2019s not ready to ship. In response to discontent with the Mac Pro \u2014 intended to be the company\u2019s most powerful computer, but released in 2013 and then never updated so it became increasingly obsolete \u2014 they held a press briefing with a small number of reporters to admit that the current design isn\u2019t working and promise a new one.",
        "Netflix\u2019s Gilmore Girls revival is providing closure in a lot of ways. But for obsessive fans of the show, the most important one is that it\u2019s finally telling us what the final four words are. During Gilmore Girls\u2019 broadcast run, showrunner Amy would tell reporters that she knew exactly how she planned to end the show, down to the final four words. But was ousted before the show\u2019s last season, and she didn\u2019t get to use her planned final four words. Until now. In the months leading up to the revival, speculation ran rampant.",
        "There are few actors on Earth who could play Mich\u00e8le, the protagonist of Dutch provocateur Paul Verhoeven\u2019s new film Elle. Mich\u00e8le is a constant mystery, to the audience and even to herself. In the film\u2019s opening scene, she is raped by a masked assailant who breaks into her home, but afterward, she merely cleans up herself and the crime scene and doesn\u2019t report the incident to the police. Why does she do this?",
        "It\u2019s only been two and a half weeks since the 2016 election, and Democrats are still hotly debating what went wrong. Could a different platform or messaging strategy have helped lead Hillary Clinton to victory? Would, perhaps, a more economically populist candidate have performed better? These questions will be picked over for years and are probably impossible to settle conclusively. But as a first pass, it\u2019s at least worth noting how Clinton performed compared with other Democratic candidates on the ballot with her \u2014 for instance, the party\u2019s Senate candidates.",
        "Thanksgiving weekend is a really good one for the movies, particularly animated ones. Frozen, Toy Story 2, and Tangled are the three biggest, Thanksgiving weekend movie openings in history. And this year, Disney\u2019s Moana stands to uphold that tradition. But for another animated film in the news this week, releasing a trailer over Thanksgiving is the best it could manage. And what a trailer it was. No one expects Pixar\u2019s Cars 3: Final Destination to be the studio\u2019s finest work.",
        "In one of the better stories written about Donald Trump\u2019s core base of supporters during the 2016 campaign, the Atlantic\u2019s Salena Zito observed that while the national media had a tendency to take Trump literally without taking his presidential ambitions seriously, his fans did just the reverse: They took him seriously but not literally. As a point about the state of mind of Trump supporters, Zito is absolutely correct. But one of Trump\u2019s most prominent supporters, the billionaire Peter Thiel, took Zito\u2019s turn of phrase and inverted its meaning."
