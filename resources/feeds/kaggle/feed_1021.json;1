        "The \u201c \u201d is a loose online movement made up mostly, though not entirely, of white nationalists. They\u2019ve gotten famous recently for being some of Donald Trump\u2019s earliest and most vocal backers, seeing him as the first presidential candidate in modern history open to their ideas about the need to protect the white race \u2014 by reducing the numbers and influence of African Americans, Hispanics, Muslims, and Jews.",
        "A politician, written off by pollsters and establishment pundits for month, rockets to the top of the polls in his party\u2019s presidential primary. He vows to \u201cconquer Islamic totalitarianism,\u201d promises to clamp down on mass immigration, and calls for a closer relationship with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. When the vote is finally held, he trounces his establishment rivals, setting him up for a general election victory. No, he\u2019s not Donald Trump: He\u2019s Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, the man who won a vote Sunday to lead France\u2019s Republican Party in the 2017 presidential election.",
        "Diet sodas have long been marketed as weight loss tools. The idea is that they allow people to enjoy the sweetness of regular soda, but without all the calories and weight gain. Some scientists, however, are highly skeptical that diet soft drinks, which contain artificial sweeteners, actually deliver on those marketing claims. And evidence seems is mounting that diet sodas and artificial sweeteners may actually promote weight gain.",
        "In the episode of Gilmore Girls, Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) impulsively decides, after meeting her future first boyfriend, Dean, that she doesn\u2019t want to attend the elite prep school she\u2019s been dreaming about. Her mom, Lorelai (Lauren Graham) reacts to this news by pointing out how similar they are. \u201cAfter all, you\u2019re me,\u201d she tells her daughter: \u201csomeone willing to throw important life experiences out the window to be with a guy. \u201d This similarity between mother and daughter isn\u2019t just the narrative conflict that kicks off the story of Gilmore Girls.",
        "Every Sunday, we pick a new episode of the week. It could be good. It could be bad. It will always be interesting. You can read the archives here. The episode of the week for November 19 through 26 is \u201cReal as Fuck,\u201d the seventh episode of the first season of HBO\u2019s Insecure. Insecure \u2014 HBO\u2019s new comedy from dynamic talent Issa Rae \u2014 explores what it means be on the cusp of 30 and unsure of where your life is or where it should be going.",
        "All year, Donald Trump has been promising to rescue the US coal industry by repealing various pollution rules and ending the \u201cwar on coal. \u201d And all year, analysts have pointed out that he probably can\u2019t stop the collapse of the coal industry \u2014 since coal\u2019s woes go far beyond the Environmental Protection Agency. But if you want a perfect example of why Trump will struggle to bring back coal, just look at Michigan.",
        "On Wednesday, November 9, after the presidential victory by Donald Trump and the Republican\u2019s sweep of both houses of Congress, Paul Ryan said that \u201cto heal the divisions of a long campaign \u2026 [t]his needs to be a time of redemption. \u201d Historically literate Americans felt it a curious choice of words. Redemption was the term used by Democrats in the 1870s to refer to the reversal of Reconstruction, a process that was perhaps the most violent and campaign in American history.",
        "Let\u2019s start with some simple math. Republicans are expected to hold 52 Senate seats in the 115th Congress. Of those 52 Republicans, 12 \u2014 Susan Collins, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Ben Sasse, Mike Lee, Rob Portman, Pat Toomey, Jeff Flake, Dean Heller, Lisa Murkowski, Cory Gardner, and Dan Sullivan \u2014 either refused to endorse Donald Trump or rescinded their endorsement and never clearly restored it during the campaign. Of the 40 remaining Senate Republicans who did endorse Trump, more than a few have voiced doubts about the . Rand Paul called him a \u201cdelusional narcissist.",
        "If Westworld can be described as \u201cabout\u201d any one thing in particular \u2014 which is a dangerous game to play, because the show is trying to encompass a great number of themes \u2014 it\u2019s about the nature of consciousness. Indeed, the show has come up with a sort of simple equation for how consciousness is formed, one that is played out, again and again, in \u201cThe Clavier,\u201d the first season\u2019s penultimate episode. Pain leads to trauma. Trauma leads to memory. And memory leads to consciousness. Think of the child who lacks complex thought processes, toddling around her home.",
        "If you ask economists what to do for struggling towns in the Rust Belt, a lot of them have a simple answer, according economist Adam Ozimek: nothing. Economists focus on helping people, not places. And often the best move for someone in a declining town is to find a new job in a different city where jobs are more plentiful. But Ozimek argues that they\u2019re making a mistake. He says that small, economically struggling places have value that\u2019s not always captured by simple economic models.",
        "While Republicans lost seats in the Senate and House, and lost the popular vote for president, the 2016 election nonetheless left them with control over all three for the first time in a decade. Finally, after toiling in opposition for years, they are set to control every lawmaking body in the federal government. Democrats still have a secret weapon, though: the filibuster. And after Republicans normalized its use over the Obama administration, you can expect Democrats to use it to block just about any major policy change that Donald Trump and Paul Ryan suggest.",
        "As The Walking Dead has staggered through its seventh season, it\u2019s drawn frequent criticisms for what has seemed to be a total abandonment of the ethical questions it struggled with throughout the early years of its run. That\u2019s why the show\u2019s choice to spend \u201cSwear\u201d weighing a militant conclave\u2019s decision not to kill an intruder is an honest surprise. After multiple encounters with bands of survivors prone to violence and mistrust, \u201cSwear\u201d is a reminder that somewhere beneath all its recent sadism, The Walking Dead still has a heart.",
        "US coal companies have been going bankrupt. In their desperate efforts to survive, they have been doing some pretty shady things. Vox has covered some of those shady maneuvers (see here, here, and here) but a new story out of West Virginia might take the cake for sheer chutzpah and shamelessness. In this case, at least according to state regulators, shady may have crossed over into outright fraud. Among other things, this case casts some light on Donald Trump\u2019s ludicrous promise to bring back lost coal jobs.",
        "Rep. Tom Price ( ) Donald Trump\u2019s pick for health and human services secretary, already has a plan for how to abolish Obamacare. The Washington Post reported late Monday that Trump intends to announce Price, who currently serves as House budget chair, to lead the federal agency overseeing Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act. Price will arrive at HHS with a clear blueprint for what comes next. He is the author of the Empowering Patients First Act, one of the most thorough and detailed proposals to repeal and replace Obamacare.",
        "There has been a tremendous amount of attention in recent days on the Electoral College, whose members will meet in all 50 states to choose the next president on December 19. There are movements afoot, such as a Change. org petition, with 4. 9 million people encouraging electors to vote for Hillary Clinton, the winner, and another arguing that electors should select a \u201ccompromise candidate. \u201d There are also organizations, such as the Hamilton Electors, encouraging electors to act independently of \u201cfaithless elector\u201d laws, and at least one lawsuit that argues such laws are unconstitutional.",
        "This Thursday, dozens of news outlets will publish stories on the same new study in the journal Science. On Friday, many of those same news outlets will all report on a study in the medical journal the Lancet. These newspapers and magazines will largely talk to the same sources, and many of their stories will be nearly identical. The reason for this synchrony is embargoes \u2014 agreements between reporters and sources that the former can have access to information from the latter, but not publish anything until a time the source has determined in advance.",
        "There\u2019s much in health care policy that divides Republicans. But there\u2019s one major idea that unites them: block grants for Medicaid. It\u2019s in the budget proposal that House Budget Chair Rep. Tom Price, Trump\u2019s pick to run Health and Human Services, released this year. It was in Trump\u2019s own health care platform during the campaign. And it is what Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway was talking about on television news shows this weekend as the administration\u2019s preferred path forward.",
        "When a Baltimore police shift commander created an arrest form for loitering on public housing, he didn\u2019t even try to hide his racist expectations. In the template, there was no space to fill in gender or race. Instead, that information was automatically filled out: \u201cblack male. \u201d This attitude was not exclusive to one cop in Baltimore. A Justice Department investigation conducted in 2015 and 2016 found black people in Baltimore were much more likely to be stopped than their white counterparts even after controlling for population.",
        "Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets of cities throughout India to protest an economic policy you probably haven\u2019t heard of before: demonetization. Three weeks ago, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi surprised his country with an announcement banning and notes \u2014 worth about $7 and $15 respectively \u2014 in a bid to tackle corruption and terrorism. He estimated that forcing people to exchange the country\u2019s largest currency bills for new banknotes would allow the government to crack down on \u201cblack money\u201d \u2014 cash holdings that haven\u2019t been taxed but, under the law, should be.",
        "For all the stunning revelations we\u2019ve seen about Donald Trump and his global business interests since the election, the larger and more troubling issue is what we don\u2019t know. A magisterial New York Times investigation found 20 countries around the world where Trump does business, and both the US and foreign governments are already talking about the intermingling of public and private interests. But the most important line in the piece by far is an observation that\u2019s not directly tied to any of that excellent reporting from around the world: \u201cThe true extent of Mr.",
        "I am a psychotherapist \u2014 specifically, a trauma therapist \u2014 in New York City. And in the aftermath of Donald Trump\u2019s win, patients and colleagues told me they felt less safe walking down the street. \u201cI feel like I did after \u201d one said. \u201cPeople on the subways look like they are in mourning,\u201d said another. I know how they feel. In the days following the election, my mind struggled to focus. I was prone to spontaneous tears. It was difficult to summon the words to speak.",
        "The death of Cuban revolutionary and former dictator Fidel Castro marked the symbolic end of an era, but it\u2019s the impending end of the Obama era \u2014 and the start of the Trump one \u2014 that could have the far bigger impact on Washington\u2019s fragile relationship with Havana. On Tuesday, Reuters reported that President Obama would not be sending a \u201cU. S. delegation\u201d to Cuba to attend Castro\u2019s funeral; this was followed minutes later by a report that US would, however, \u201cbe represented at Castro funeral by Security Adviser [Ben] Rhodes and U. S. Ambassador to Cuba [Jeffrey] Delaurentis.",
        "On Wednesday morning, Donald Trump announced that he will nominate Steven Mnuchin for secretary of the Treasury, delivering another top job in the to someone whose main qualification is personal loyalty to Donald Trump. Mnuchin is a banker and hedge fund guy who\u2019s worked for Goldman Sachs and has zero experience in politics or policy. His views on the issues are a total and complete mystery, and indeed his very appointment seems to cut against much of Trump\u2019s rhetoric on the campaign trail.",
        "Donald Trump is the Republican Party controls both branches of Congress, and Speaker Paul Ryan is hatching plans to shred the social safety net. And Democrats are responding by sticking with more or less the same leadership team that helped get them here in the first place. On Wednesday, House Democrats reelected Nancy Pelosi, who has been in charge of the caucus since 2003, as House minority leader, defeating a insurgent campaign by Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan in a vote.",
        "Let\u2019s say you\u2019re at the doctor. And the doctor hands you a prescription. The prescription is for Humira, an injectable medication used to treat a lot of common conditions like arthritis and psoriasis. Humira is an especially popular medication right now. In 2015, patients all around the world spent $14 billion on Humira prescriptions \u2014 that\u2019s roughly the size of Jamaica\u2019s entire economy. Let\u2019s say your doctor appointment is happening in the United Kingdom. There, your Humira prescription will cost, on average, $1, 362. If you\u2019re seeing a doctor in Switzerland, the drug runs around $822.",
        "Donald Trump is currently both of the United States and chair of the Trump Organization, his vast business that includes real estate development projects around the world. It\u2019s an unprecedented situation \u2014 one that\u2019s extremely vulnerable to conflicts of interest and the potential for corruption. Foreign governments are already trying to curry favor with the Trump administration by staying in Trump\u2019s hotels and appointing his business partners as diplomatic envoys. Trump has met in his New York office with business partners from India.",
        "A federal district court on Friday blocked new Texas regulations that would have required fetal tissue to be cremated or buried, no matter the stage of development. The rules had been temporarily blocked until the district court could hear arguments for an injunction, which it did in a hearing earlier this month. The unusual health department regulations, if they had gone into effect as planned on December 19, would have dramatically increased the cost of an abortion for women without adding any clear public health or safety benefits.",
        "On Wednesday afternoon, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif called Donald Trump to talk about working together in the future. The Pakistani government then released what\u2019s called a \u201creadout,\u201d which is usually a fairly boring summary of a call between world leaders. Only this one \u2026 well, it\u2019s not boring. It reads more like a transcript of actual things Trump said to Sharif, and those things are amazing. Here\u2019s the readout in full: Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif called USA Donald Trump and felicitated him on his victory.",
        "Over the weekend, Donald Trump alleged the existence of massive voter fraud in an election he indisputably won. Tuesday morning, seemingly inspired by a Fox News segment, he tweeted that flag burning should be not only illegal (a popular stance widely if sporadically held by Republican politicians) but punishable via loss of citizenship. The previous night, he retweeted a teen Trump fan\u2019s attacks on CNN reporter Jeff Zeleny.",
        "There\u2019s a growing body of research in political science and political psychology suggesting that even very mild messages or cues that touch on race can alter political opinions. The landmark book on the subject is Princeton professor Tali Mendelberg\u2019s 2001 book The Race Card, which marshaled a wide array of evidence to show that implicit racial messages are used with shocking regularity by American politicians, and have real effects. Mendelberg looks back to George H. W."
