        "After three years of wrangling, the House on Wednesday passed a $6. 3 billion bill that would dramatically overhaul the way drugs are approved in the United States. The 21st Century Cures Act is a bipartisan effort that\u2019s been in the works since April 2014. The idea behind the bill is that the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s current approval process is clunky and out of date, delaying potentially lifesaving drugs and devices from reaching the patients who need them.",
        "It\u2019s been almost three weeks now. The news cycle has moved on. But I, for one, have not fully processed the news that Donald J. Trump is going to be president. Those words still sound like nonsense to me. I can\u2019t shake the sense of surreality. And I know I\u2019m not alone. Before we\u2019re entirely swept up in the Trump Outrage of the Day, I want to at least pause, take stock, and attempt to answer a simple question: What the fuck just happened?",
        "Two years ago, global oil prices crashed after the world started pumping out far more crude than anyone needed. That plunge, from $100 per barrel down to $40, upended the global economy \u2014 and cost oil producers like Saudi Arabia billions in lost revenue. Now those oil producers have had enough. On Wednesday in Vienna, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries reached a deal to cut their oil production by 1. 2 million barrels per day in order to raise global prices.",
        "South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court just ruled to uphold the impeachment of the country\u2019s president, Park meaning she is now officially removed from office. It is the first time a president has ever been removed from office in South Korea. Back in December, South Korean lawmakers \u2014 including some from the president\u2019s own party \u2014 voted overwhelmingly to impeach Park. The effort to remove her from office then moved to the country\u2019s Constitutional Court, which had 180 days to weigh the measure and rule on its legality. That\u2019s the ruling that was just handed down.",
        "A jump in traffic fatalities over the past two years has brought media attention to this tragic aspect of American life. Such deaths are up 7 percent in 2015, and 10 percent for the first six months of 2016 \u2014 a phenomenon news outlets are describing as \u201csurprising,\u201d \u201csudden,\u201d and \u201cunexpected,\u201d an unpleasant departure from the historic trend toward greater safety. We are on track to kill 38, 000 vehicle occupants, motorcyclists, bicyclists, and pedestrians in 2016. The White House has issued a call to action, asking researchers to scrutinize the data on all road deaths.",
        "The Fight for $15 movement has notched a string of victories over the past couple of years, getting higher minimum wage legislation passed in the states of California and New York as well as several cities. And earlier this month, McDonald\u2019s announced that it was going to begin installing touchscreen ordering kiosks in its restaurants, which should allow restaurants to serve more customers with fewer workers. And in a post for Forbes, former McDonald\u2019s CEO Ed Rensi argues these two trends are connected. \u201cI told you so,\u201d he writes.",
        "Former Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein\u2019s call for a recount is finally nearing an end. Efforts in Michigan and Pennsylvania were both stopped by federal judges. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin both certified Trump\u2019s victory on December 12. In the three states that lost Hillary Clinton the election, Stein \u2014 who only earned about 1 percent of the national vote and ran a campaign on just $2. 5 million \u2014 was successfully able to carry out a recount in one, Wisconsin, where Trump remained the victor and the results were largely unchanged.",
        "Writer Frank Bures sparked some controversy Monday with an article published at Slate called \u201cIs PMS Real?\u201d For the roughly 75 percent of menstruating women who experience PMS (premenstrual syndrome) the headline\u2019s question was both nonsensical and insulting. Of course PMS is real, say the many women who deal with symptoms like cramping, bloating, irritability, fatigue, and depression every month. Is PMS real? A question that somehow still must be debated! once more! by a male writer! @Slate \u2014 Hannah Rose Ewens (@hannahrosewens) November 28, 2016 Bures\u2019s actual argument isn\u2019t as clumsy as the headline.",
        "During the presidential campaign, Donald Trump seemed to demonstrate little interest in the tenets of movement conservatism. He vowed that he wouldn\u2019t cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid and said little about shrinking the size of government. He positioned himself as a champion of the American working man against powerful bankers and corporations. He rarely discussed social issues, except to repeat assurances that he was and . Yet several of the \u2019s most recent Cabinet picks are in no way, shape, or form outsider populists.",
        "This week, Donald Trump has been trumpeting an announcement by Carrier, which makes furnaces and air conditioners, that the company will be keeping about 800 jobs in the United States instead of moving them to Mexico. This is obviously great news for the 800 American workers whose jobs will be saved, and it has already generated a lot of positive publicity for Donald Trump. But the announcement also illustrates an inherent problem with Trump\u2019s approach to economic policymaking: As he focuses on deals, he\u2019s neglecting the larger policy questions that will ultimately determine the success of his economic agenda.",
        "As it stands right now, Donald Trump could start requiring people in the US from countries to register with the government on his first day in office. He could do it by reinstituting a program that President Barack Obama suspended in 2011 \u2014 after years of complaints by civil rights groups that the program targeted Muslims and wasn\u2019t effective in preventing terrorism. While Obama suspended the registry program, called the \u201cNational Security Registration System\u201d or NSEERS, he didn\u2019t fully dismantle it \u2014 so it\u2019s still sitting around for a Trump administration to dust off.",
        "Back in 2000, many political watchers blamed Green Party candidate Ralph Nader for George W. Bush\u2019s victory over Al Gore \u2014 arguing that if just a few of the 97, 000 Florida voters who had voted Nader went to Gore instead, Gore would have been able to close Bush\u2019s advantage in the state and win the presidential election. Today, it seems a similar drumbeat is starting for the 2016 election \u2014 only this time some pundits are blaming Green Party candidate Jill Stein for costing Hillary Clinton the election.",
        "Carrier, the HVAC company that since 1979 has been a subsidiary of the larger United Technologies conglomerate, announced several months ago that it was going to close two facilities in Indiana and shift production to a new plant the company is building in Mexico. The move was telegraphed well in advance as part of the company\u2019s obligations to its workforce, but in a practical sense that only made the sting worse. The plants weren\u2019t closing because Carrier was losing money hand over fist or because the products they made were obsolete.",
        "Republicans have pitched Obamacare \u201crepeal and delay\u201d \u2014 the idea of quickly repealing the Affordable Care Act, but leaving it in place for three years as they craft a replacement \u2014 as the path they\u2019re most likely to pursue. But one key health care expert threw cold water on that idea: \u201cIt will be a death spiral. The Trump administration will have put it in a death spiral. \u201d Robert Laszewski is president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates, a Washington, consulting firm that works closely with many health insurers. During the botched Healthcare.",
        "Democrats have reason to be frustrated these days. They won the presidential popular vote and the Senate popular vote, and they were just shy of winning the House popular vote. And yet they are entirely shut out of power in Washington. The Electoral College and Senate are here to stay, needless to say, but Democrats do have an unexpected chance to make substantial gains in the House and in state legislatures if they can convince the Supreme Court to go along.",
        "I spent 11 years addicted to methamphetamine and have now been clean for nine. Today, I am a instructor, a budding entrepreneur, a volunteer first responder, a friend and family member. Yet at my core I consider myself a recovered drug addict. So to the fellow addict: You may get as much from learning my story as I would get from learning yours. Maybe less, probably not more. But, to those of you who know and love an addict, hopeless though he or she may appear: This article is for you.",
        "Apple\u2019s internal corporate structure is unusual for a large company because it\u2019s built almost entirely around functional groups defined by expertise (design, software engineering, hardware engineering, hardware technology) rather than divisions structured by products (iPhone and iPads, Macs, peripherals). This strongly functional structure is the main reason Apple has started struggling with the seemingly banal task of keeping its personal computers, and especially its Mac Pro desktop, up to date with the latest and most powerful computer chips. Functional organization means Apple can put enormous resources behind top priorities.",
        "The Hamilton lyric \u201clook around, look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now\u201d can sometimes feel like an ironic taunt, but at 1 pm EST today, it\u2019ll be hard to argue. Miranda has been putting together The Hamilton Mixtape for months now, recruiting Hamilton fans and influences alike to put their own spins on the musical\u2019s numbers. To celebrate its December 2 release, there will be a concert of some of the mixtape\u2019s numbers. It appears to be taking place at Hamilton\u2019s Richard Rodgers Theatre, in the spirit of Miranda\u2019s ticket lottery Ham4Ham concerts.",
        "Neuroscientist Nathan Rose and his colleagues at the University of Wisconsin recently lost track of a memory. I mean that literally. One minute, they saw a trace of a memory \u201clight up\u201d in an fMRI scan. In the next minute it was gone. And in this one simple observation, Rose and his colleagues are challenging a scientific belief about how the brain works. And can open to door to new understanding of why we remember, and why we forget. The curious case of the \u201cmissing\u201d memory Rose lost the memory during a fairly simple experiment.",
        "Every year, it seems that one of the four Oscar acting categories is several orders of magnitude weaker than the others, and this year, that category is Best Supporting Actor. There are certainly some fine contenders, including Mahershala Ali from Moonlight, Jeff Bridges from Hell or High Water, and Lucas Hedges from Manchester by the Sea, among others.",
        "Sitting CIA directors generally don\u2019t blast incoming presidents \u2014 much less in an interview with a foreign news agency. Yet here we are. On Wednesday morning, the BBC published excerpts from an interview with CIA Director John Brennan, the first time a serving head of America\u2019s spy agency has sat down with the British media, according to the BBC. Brennan\u2019s comments are, unmistakably, a shot at Donald Trump.",
        "Donald Trump has been ruffling diplomatic feathers since he was elected by casually talking to world leaders without first getting guidance from the State Department. He\u2019s already angered close allies like Britain and India, but his latest phone call threatens to do far more damage. That\u2019s because of whom it was with: President Tsai of Taiwan. This isn\u2019t just some charming diplomatic faux pas by Trump \u2014 this was a blunder of potentially historic proportions.",
        "There\u2019s less than two months left until the Republican Party takes complete control of the government on January 20, 2017. But Washington won\u2019t simply be at a standstill until then. What happens in Congress in the time President Obama has left \u2014 during what\u2019s known as the \u201c session\u201d \u2014 will have a huge impact on the lives of millions of Americans.",
        "When Donald Trump set out to pick the next education secretary, he faced a stark choice. He could choose an insider who had shaped education policy for a state or large school district. Or he could bring in an outsider \u2014 someone who views traditional public schools as a failed system in need of dismantling. He picked an outsider. Unlike most of her predecessors, Betsy DeVos, Trump\u2019s nominee for education secretary, has never taught in a public school or college, run a school district or public university, served on a school board, or shaped state education policy.",
        "After three years of stalling in the House and Senate, President Obama signed into law the biggest health reform bill since the Affordable Care Act. The $6. 3 billion 21st Century Cures Act is a controversial, bipartisan effort that\u2019s been in the works since April 2014. As its name would suggest, it\u2019s been touted as legislation that\u2019ll help get medical cures to patients faster by boosting health research funding and speeding up the drug regulatory process. But health researchers have called the Cures Act \u201dlipstick on a pig\u201d and the \u201d19th Century Fraud Act\u201d for good reason.",
        "CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts \u2014 One by one, the political operatives sitting around the table at Harvard\u2019s campaign managers conference Wednesday afternoon explained why they thought their candidate could win \u2014 even though he or she ended up losing. And then came Corey Lewandowski. Lewandowski explained how he joined Donald Trump\u2019s team in January 2015, and helped run \u201cthe most unconventional race in the history of the presidency\u201d before his eventual firing 18 months later. \u201cEmbracing Mr. Trump\u2019s wealth and not running from it,\u201d Lewandowski said, \u201cwas a strategic decision that we made early on.",
        "The results of the 2016 presidential election may have led you to come to one of two wildly different conclusions: Either Donald Trump\u2019s election was a rejection of identity politics or his election was a validation of the prominence of identity politics in the US. Whichever you believe, there are very different implications on how the country \u2014 and especially the Democratic Party \u2014 should move forward. Should the emphasis be on finally addressing America\u2019s long history of systemic racism, going from slavery to the criminal justice system?",
        "For the first time, Donald Trump has said he supports finishing construction of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline, which is currently being held up by both the Obama administration and (more significantly) massive protests near an Indian reservation in North Dakota. No one should be too shocked that Trump would endorse the $3. 8 billion project. He\u2019s repeatedly said that he\u2019s in favor of more fossil fuel infrastructure. And the company behind the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, had donated $100, 000 to a Trump Victory Fund before the election in the hopes he\u2019d greenlight it.",
        "It only took one episode for diehard Mr. Robot fans to figure out the big twist of the show\u2019s second season. Elliot Alderson, the show\u2019s paranoid, protagonist and unreliable narrator, was living in isolation at his mother\u2019s. He\u2019d gone there to unplug from the internet, which he had used in season one to bring down much of the world\u2019s economic system. But viewers quickly realized that not everything about Elliot\u2019s exile made a lot of sense. By the end of the premiere, Reddit users had decided he was either in prison or at a mental health facility.",
        "Normally, what a snake eats for breakfast isn\u2019t worth a headline. But this is no normal snake. And this was no normal meal. The Burmese python is a massive snake native to Southeast Asia that arrived in South Florida in the 1980s, possibly released into the wild by careless pet owners. There are now as many as 300, 000 of these invasive creatures slithering through the state, and they\u2019ve been known to eat alligators, bobcats, rabbits, and birds."
