        "Back in the early 1990s, Dr. Mike Aamodt, then a forensic psychology professor at Radford University, started to collect and code data on serial killers. At the time, \u201cthere wasn\u2019t much out there,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to change that. \u201d Over a period, Aamodt and his students went through public records of serial murderer cases around the globe, collecting granular data on nearly 3, 000 US serial killers and 10, 000 victims.",
        "Near the end of Westworld\u2019s first season, Host designer Bernard Lowe (Jeffrey Wright) recently revealed to be a Host himself, tearfully asks the park director, Robert Ford (Anthony Hopkins) how Ford could so casually force Bernard to murder someone \u2014 Bernard\u2019s own lover, no less. But Ford is past the pretense that he needs a reason.",
        "In the first night of his \u201cvictory tour\u201d rally, Donald Trump promised to build a border wall, defended appointing billionaires to his Cabinet, and said \u201canything is possible\u201d in America now that he\u2019s won the election. But throughout the speech in Cincinnati, Trump often appeared far more interested in looking back at the presidential campaign than looking forward to his presidency. He repeatedly replayed the highs and lows of the campaign, relishing in bashing those who had doubted him. Trump couldn\u2019t resist bringing his speech back to the election, even when he was supposed to talk about his presidency.",
        "This year, like every year, people will take to the streets across the Netherlands and Belgium to celebrate Christmas festivities by dressing up as St. Nicholas and his \u201cassistant,\u201d Black Pete. And like every year, people will put on blackface to portray Black Pete. According to the legend, St. Nicholas (Sinterklaas in Dutch) lives in Spain, arrives in Holland by boat every year with a team of black assistants in tow, and spends a month delivering presents to children across the country.",
        "Pablo Larra\u00edn is from Chile, which might make him a less than obvious choice to direct Jackie, a movie about America\u2019s first lady: Jacqueline Kennedy. Rating 4. 5 The pairing, however, is inspired \u2014 partly because Jackie is played to perfection (and with an affected accent) by Natalie Portman. But Larra\u00edn\u2019s take on the story, with an expertly executed screenplay by Noah Oppenheim, is that the legend of the Camelot years is best approached as a sort of experimental movie, an exercise in .",
        "Every weekend, we pick a movie you can stream that dovetails with current events. Old, new, blockbuster, arthouse: They\u2019re all fair game. What you can count on is a weekend watch that sheds new light on the week that was. The movie of the week for November 27 through December 2 is Spotlight (2015) which is streaming on Netflix and available to digitally rent on Amazon and iTunes.",
        "The Eyes of My Mother starts behind the wheel of a truck. A murder ballad plays on the radio as the driver grinds the gears to a halt and gets out to investigate why a woman walked into the road, sensed the truck\u2019s approach, and then didn\u2019t run away but lay down in the giant truck\u2019s path. Rating 3 It\u2019s an eerie way to start a movie, but it turns out to be the least unsettling part of Nicolas Pesce\u2019s first feature film, a nightmare that\u2019s shot like an art film.",
        "On Sunday, the US Army Corps of Engineers said it would not grant a needed easement that would allow the Dakota Access Pipeline to cross the Missouri River at Lake Oahe \u2014 putting the controversial project on hold indefinitely while officials explore alternative routes. The decision is a major victory for the Standing Rock Sioux, who have been protesting the proposed path of the $3. 8 billion pipeline through southern North Dakota for months \u2014 arguing that it would endanger both their water supplies and nearby sacred sites.",
        "Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is resigning after Italian voters rejected a constitutional reform proposal Renzi had avidly supported. His resignation could have big implications not only for Italian politics but also for the health of Italy\u2019s banks and ultimately the future of Europe\u2019s common currency. Renzi\u2019s resignation will lead to a period of uncertainty as Italy tries to form a new government. And that\u2019s significant because some Italian banks are teetering on the edge of insolvency.",
        "The results aren\u2019t even fully counted in Austria\u2019s presidential election. Yet the Freedom Party\u2019s candidate, Norbert Hofer, has already conceded defeat due to crushing early returns \u2014 a result that stunned political observers and gives hope that the wave sweeping the West can be stopped. The polls closed at 5 pm Vienna time (11 am EST) on Sunday. Projections based on early returns showed Hofer\u2019s opponent \u2014 the independent candidate Alexander Van der Bellen \u2014 with a lead (53. 6 percent to 46. 4 percent).",
        "Every Sunday, we pick a new episode of the week. It could be good. It could be bad. It will always be interesting. You can read the archives here. The episode of the week for November 27 through December 3, 2016, is the November 29 episode of Comedy Central\u2019s The Daily Show with Trevor Noah. Daily Show host Trevor Noah, like many of his fellow late night hosts, has seemed unsure of how to treat the ongoing fallout from Donald Trump\u2019s election victory.",
        "Scientists don\u2019t know much about how tardigrades have sex. That\u2019s a shame. Tardigrades \u2014 microscopic animals that primarily live in water \u2014 are some of the most fascinating creatures on Earth, with biological powers of resilience usually found in comic books. They\u2019re able to survive in just about any environment. They can withstand the shock of boiling water and temperatures that near absolute zero. They can survive in the crushing pressures of the deep ocean or go without water for decades. They\u2019ve even survived in the vacuum of space.",
        "In the two weeks that\u2019ve passed since Saturday Night Live\u2019s last new episode, Donald Trump has given the show an overwhelming amount of material to work with thanks to a parade of troubling Cabinet picks, rampant conflicts of interest, unprecedented casual phone calls to foreign leaders, and of course, sporadic tweets meant to attack his critics and defend (some of) his most controversial actions.",
        "A Republican elector from Texas announced Monday that he would refuse to cast his Electoral College vote for Donald Trump. Christopher Suprun, a paramedic from Texas, wrote in a New York Times that he could not support \u201csomeone who shows daily he is not qualified for the office. \u201d He continues: \u201cFifteen years ago, I swore an oath to defend my country and Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. On Dec. 19, I will do it again.",
        "On Sunday, a man walked into a pizzeria in Washington, DC, with an assault rifle and fired one or more shots. The scene, thankfully, was not another example of a mass shooting \u2014 no one was injured or killed. Instead, it was the result of a fake news story about Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign that proliferated on social media in the weeks before Election Day.",
        "Every concrete indication we have so far suggests that Donald Trump is going to be a disaster for climate policy. He\u2019s surrounded by advisers who want to ramp up development and don\u2019t care even a little bit about global warming. He\u2019s tapped Myron Ebell, one of Washington\u2019s most prominent climate deniers, to lead his EPA transition team. He\u2019s pledged to withdraw from the Paris climate deal \u2014 the most significant global strategy to date to tackle rising temperatures. Trump himself has called global warming a \u201choax\u201d and \u201cbullshit. \u201d His chief of staff says Trump really means it.",
        "Like many journalists who write about politics for a living, I had a story on the 2016 outcome written the week before Election Day that presumed Hillary Clinton was going to win the election. Since she instead lost the election, we didn\u2019t run that piece. I\u2019ve since written a bunch of stories about the consequences of the election, but I hadn\u2019t managed to pull my thoughts together on a piece laying out my view of what actually happened and why.",
        "The video in the North Charleston, South Carolina, police shooting of Walter Scott couldn\u2019t be any clearer: Scott posed no threat to police officer Michael Slager when Slager shot at least eight times at Scott\u2019s back. Scott was fleeing, but the was barely running \u2014 he was moving so slowly that Slager could have caught up to him with a brisk walk. And the encounter began after Scott ran from a traffic stop over a broken brake light \u2014 hardly a matter of grave public concern. And yet.",
        "In an election season that was fairly brutal to Democrats, leaving them with no control over any level of government, there was one bright spot for the party: Democrat Roy Cooper beat Republican Gov. Pat McCrory in the gubernatorial race in North Carolina. Cooper\u2019s margin of victory was razor thin, coming down to just a few thousand votes in the state. But one thing that\u2019s notable is how Cooper appeared to overperform compared with other Democrats across North Carolina.",
        "For decades, grocery stores have dreamed of fully automated technology that would allow them to dispense with cashiers altogether. But systems introduced so far have been clunky and wound up just shifting a lot of work from store employees onto the customer. On Monday, Amazon introduced a new technology that \u2014 if it works as advertised \u2014 could totally transform the retail sector. Called \u201cAmazon Go,\u201d the technology literally allows people to walk into a store, select items they want to purchase, and walk out. There\u2019s no checkout process at all.",
        "Maps are flat representations of our spherical planet. I cut open a plastic globe to understand just what it takes to turn a sphere into something flat: My struggle to make a flat map out of the plastic globe is indicative of a challenge mapmakers have faced for centuries: It is mathematically impossible to translate the surface of a sphere onto a plane without some form of distortion. To solve this problem, mathematicians and cartographers have developed a huge library of representations of the globe, each distorting a certain attribute and preserving others.",
        "The Kremlin\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential election became apparent during the Democratic National Convention this summer. WikiLeaks, which now operates as a de facto Russian front, released a trove of stolen emails from the server of the Democratic National Committee. The leak served two purposes: to raise doubts about the legitimacy of Clinton\u2019s nomination and to give a subtle boost to her Republican rival, Donald Trump.",
        "Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi\u2019s referendum on reforming the country\u2019s constitution failed on Sunday, an outcome that will shake up the country\u2019s political scene, raise questions over its commitment to the euro, and likely create volatility in its ailing banking sector. By late Sunday night, the BBC reported that projections showed a healthy majority of Italians voted \u201cno\u201d on a package of reforms proposed by Renzi and his Democratic Party to dramatically reduce the size and power of one of Italy\u2019s two chambers of parliament.",
        "What makes you you? Is it the things you like? The feelings you feel? The thoughts you have? Or is it something more ephemeral \u2014 something religion might dub the \u201csoul,\u201d the part of yourself that is hidden away and untouchable to everyone but God? In its season one finale, \u201cThe Bicameral Mind,\u201d Westworld suggests that there is no answer to the above question. The season, all along, seemed as if it were a meditation on the nature of consciousness, and it was \u2014 sort of.",
        "When The Sopranos debuted on HBO in 1999, its impact was seismic. Other TV networks immediately started trying to copy it. The show\u2019s offbeat storytelling rhythms and antiheroic main character spread across the vast televisual landscape. And it won award after award after award. Except \u2026 that\u2019s not really true. It was eventually true, but it took a few years \u2014 and in some cases, the bulk of The Sopranos\u2019 run \u2014 to play out.",
        "During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump made a lot of insinuations and vague comments with potentially dangerous implications. He brought conspiracy theories to the mainstream, declared massive untruths, and refused to divulge personal records. Any attack on his businesses would be buried in media feuds and legal threats \u2014 instigated by Trump himself. It all posed a very real dilemma for journalists.",
        "Late on Tuesday afternoon, President Obama flew down to Tampa Bay, Florida, to speak at MacDill Air Force Base in what would be his final address to a uniformed military audience as their commander in chief. The speech was billed as an address on his counterterrorism legacy \u2014 and for the most part, it was. Much of the speech was dedicated to lengthy defenses of Obama\u2019s approach to fighting ISIS (persuasive) and his 2009 troop surge in Afghanistan (less so).",
        "German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been under fire in Germany for allowing hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees into the country \u2014 and, according to her critics, letting them bring in a fundamentalist strain of Islam at odds with her country\u2019s secular foundations. Her response? Taking a page from the playbook of neighboring France and calling for a ban on veils, or burqas, in Germany. The covering, she declared to applause at a convention for her Christian Democratic Union party, is \u201cnot acceptable in Germany. \u201d \u201dIt should be banned, wherever it is legally possible,\u201d she added.",
        "Even though some studies have indicated that recent immigrants and their children have struggled to make their lives better in the US, the Census has recently found (using 2013 data) that upward mobility still exists. Children of immigrants are more likely to be college educated, have better paying jobs, and are less likely to live in poverty than their parents. That said, these material gains aren\u2019t equally enjoyed by all newcomers or spread equally across generations. Women, in particular, are at a severe disadvantage.",
        "On Thursday, former NFL player Joe McKnight was shot and killed in what appeared to be a road rage incident in Terrytown, Louisiana. Police initially released the shooter, Ronald Gasser, from custody, sparking a massive uproar on social media that this was yet another case of a white man getting away with killing a black man. But on Monday, Gasser was arrested for manslaughter."
