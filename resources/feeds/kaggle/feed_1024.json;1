        "[Many spoilers for season one of Westworld follow.] Westworld\u2019s penultimate episode had several reveals, but its most significant moment is a small one. Maeve (Thandie Newton) \u2014 a robotic Host out for revenge on her makers \u2014 asks for help from the bandit Hector (Rodrigo Santoro). Since it requires him to \u201cbreak into hell,\u201d it\u2019s a big ask. But when he realizes the safe he\u2019s risked everything to steal is actually empty, it\u2019s proof that something\u2019s wrong. It breaks his programming enough to remember Maeve; he answers, \u201cI\u2019ll go. \u201d It\u2019s significant because Hector isn\u2019t special.",
        "Donald Trump ran for president as our first candidate. He positioned himself, early and often, as the Republican primary\u2019s villain, the guy who wasn\u2019t there to make friends, the one you \u201clove to hate. \u201d He stepped back from some of this in the general election, but he did, notably, manufacture a reality cliffhanger in the third debate over whether he would accept the outcome of the election (back when most thought he would lose) and there was a brief hope on the part of some liberals that cut footage from The Apprentice would surface and tank Trump\u2019s chances.",
        "Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison has for weeks looked like a frontrunner to become the next chair of the Democratic National Committee. An early Bernie Sanders endorser, Ellison has received the support of the progressive caucus. And he\u2019s won the backing of establishment Democrats like Sen. Chuck Schumer, giving him what looks like the blessing of the twin power centers of the party. But over the past week, a handful of Ellison\u2019s critics have latched onto remarks of his about Israel and American Jews that they say should rule him out for the job.",
        "A miscarriage is a natural and common event. All told, probably more women have lost a child from this world than haven\u2019t. Most don\u2019t mention it, and they go on from day to day as if it hadn\u2019t happened, and so people imagine that woman in this situation never really knew or loved what she had. But ask her sometime: How old would your child be now? And she\u2019ll know. \u2014 Barbara Kingsolver, Animal Dreams My son would be turning 20 this month. He was due on December 15, 1996.",
        "The stars of HGTV \u2014 the Home and Garden Television network \u2014 are patron saints of aspirational living. Jonathan and Drew Scott, better known as the Property Brothers, help people purchase rundown shanties and transform them into plush oases. On Love It or List It, Hilary Farr and David Visentin rehabilitate homeowners\u2019 current digs while also helping them decide if they want to move. A variety of other personalities and programs cover everything from flipping houses to buying real estate overseas.",
        "Last weekend, as I was pensively staring into nothingness on the DC metro, a stranger approached me and said, \u201cA penny for your thoughts?\u201d We struck up a conversation, then, two stops later, went our separate ways. But the idiom \u2014 a penny for your thoughts \u2014 lingered. And I couldn\u2019t help but speculate: What if the idiom were economically redeemable not just for musings spoken aloud, but the thousands of internal thoughts that go through my mind each day? If I got a penny for every thought I had, how rich would I be? Let\u2019s find out.",
        "Republicans have long supported a massive overhaul of Medicare, the health entitlement program for seniors, one that they argue will make the entitlement program more sustainable \u2014 but also would have seniors spend significantly more out of pocket. Now, the party\u2019s control of Washington opens the door to making that policy vision a reality. Republicans have, under the leadership of House Speaker Rep. Paul Ryan, coalesced around supporting a \u201cpremium support\u201d version of Medicare, where seniors get a fixed amount of money to shop for a health plan.",
        "A Quinnipiac poll released Tuesday finds that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has a pathetic 19 percent approval rating, while a massive 77 percent of his state\u2019s voters disapprove of him. The administrators of the Quinnipiac University Poll said in a release that they\u2019ve been polling for more than 20 years, and this is \u201cthe lowest approval rating ever measured for a governor\u201d in the states they\u2019ve surveyed. Christie was once viewed as a political rising star and potential GOP presidential nominee, but when news of the Bridgegate scandal broke in early 2014, his popularity started to fade.",
        "I\u2019ve started to rewatch Trump rallies from the month before he was elected president. I\u2019ve seen some of them before, but that was always with the presumption he was unlikely to win. Now I watch them trying to figure out how he did it, and how the Democrats can rebuild their economic message out of this mess. His speeches are full of virulent ethnic nationalism, to be sure \u2014 that\u2019s what I noticed during the campaign \u2014 but he also has a way of approaching the economy that sabotages Democratic positions effectively, even when those positions are strong.",
        "Here is an unsettling reality for many liberals following the election: It is entirely plausible that Donald Trump will succeed on his own terms, and will flourish politically for it. There\u2019s a real possibility that he will carry out his promises to punish some people (mainly nonwhite) as a way to reward others \u2014 and that keeping those promises will not only secure the loyalty of his supporters but make more white people more conservative on issues of race. It\u2019s entirely possible that the problem with the Democratic Party, or with in everyday life, isn\u2019t just tactical but strategic.",
        "Even before the election of Donald Trump, it was clear that states and cities \u2014 what climate nerds call \u201csubnational actors\u201d \u2014 are central to tackling climate change. Now that the US federal government is getting out of the climate protection business, at least for four years, subnational actors are more important than ever. Especially cities. Cities generate most of the world\u2019s economic activity, innovation, and cultural ferment. They also generate a growing share of its carbon emissions: according to the IPCC, cities are responsible for about 75 percent of global CO2 emissions.",
        "Donald Trump claims he\u2019s taken a small step toward alleviating the massive conflict of interest posed by his business empire: Back in June, his spokesperson says, he sold his stock portfolio of up to $40 million in publicly traded companies. The said he did it because he didn\u2019t think \u201cit\u2019s appropriate for me to be owing stocks when I\u2019m making deals for this country. \u201d But there are some reasons to be skeptical. Trump didn\u2019t announce the stock sale at the time, and hasn\u2019t mentioned it since, even when it would have been politically advantageous to do so.",
        "On Tuesday, Dylann Roof was sentenced to death for the racist mass shooting attack on a black church in Charleston, South Carolina. It was more than a year and a half ago that Roof walked into the church. He did not go in there to learn, pray, and worship, as the predominantly black congregants did. After sitting at the Bible study session for nearly an hour, Roof pulled out a gun and fired 77 shots \u2014 killing nine people. The shooting was a time of massive tragedy and mourning for the nation.",
        "Donald Trump plans to nominate Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency \u2014 a pick that suggests big, big changes could be in store for environmental policy. The EPA is in charge of creating and enforcing federal regulations around air and water pollution, largely guided by laws like the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, which were first passed by Congress in the 1970s.",
        "In October, Otto announced that it had completed the first commercial driverless truck delivery in Colorado. In November, McDonald\u2019s announced that it was rolling out touchscreen ordering systems nationwide. Now, Amazon is opening a new convenience store with no checkout lines and no cashiers. Add it all up, and it looks like an apocalyptic future for workers. Cashiers and fast food workers are near the top of the government\u2019s list of the jobs that employ the most people in the United States, with 3. 3 million and 2. 9 million workers working at these jobs, respectively.",
        "Picking the best network on TV in any given year is usually a bland proposition \u2014 it\u2019s almost always FX, and when it\u2019s not, it\u2019s probably HBO. (Netflix could also make a claim for 2016, but those three networks are about it for this year.) Far more interesting is the question of which TV network has had a breakthrough year.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s unexpected rise to power and eccentric behavior have spawned a boom industry in takes about why his supporters don\u2019t care about this or that. We\u2019ve learned why Trump\u2019s supporters \u201cdon\u2019t care that he\u2019s lying\u201d and \u201cWhy facts don\u2019t matter to Trump\u2019s supporters. \u201d They don\u2019t care about his sexual assault accusations, so it\u2019s reasonable for skeptics to wonder if new stories about financial conflicts of interest or conducting foreign policy by Twitter will move the needle. \u201cYeah, but his supporters don\u2019t care about that\u201d is an endlessly repeated refrain in response to any new line of criticism.",
        "Two of the for style and ethics across the news industry sent a message to journalists everywhere last week: When reporting about the group that\u2019s dubbed itself \u201cthe alternative right,\u201d make it clear that their movement isn\u2019t simply a hip new twist on conservatism \u2014 and that, in fact, its racist beliefs and goals demand comparisons to America\u2019s most infamous kind of hate groups. John Daniszewski, the Associated Press vice president for standards, told the AP\u2019s reporters and the countless journalists across the industry who use its stylebook to be clear about what the is to readers.",
        "Human ingenuity increasingly allows us to fight back against \u201cnatural selection\u201d and, in effect, influence the path of our own evolution. Take Cesarean sections, the procedure in which babies are born via surgical incision rather than through the mother\u2019s birth canal. Some form of the procedure has been around for hundreds of years, but only in the past few decades has it become commonplace. In the US, now account for 30 percent of all births, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But back in 1970, that figure was around 5 percent.",
        "It\u2019s not easy to stay healthy when your home is surrounded by pools of feces. And that\u2019s only one of Barbara Thomas\u2019s health problems. I meet Thomas in the Washington Heights neighborhood, a patchwork of dusty streets surrounded by farmland, less than 5 miles from Ferriday, a small town in Concordia Parish, central Louisiana. Every day, Thomas, who is 60, wakes up fearing rain. If the skies pour down on her bungalow, the pools of wastewater that have gathered in her backyard will swell.",
        "Donald Trump has officially nominated retired Gen. John Kelly to lead the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 a agency that\u2019s going to be responsible for implementing many of Trump\u2019s most policies, from preventing terrorism to building a \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d along the border. But the way Kelly sees the world, and his potential next job, goes way beyond the border or the wall. He sees the challenges to US security as holistic and regional \u2014 and believes that fixing them requires doing more throughout Latin America, not simply walling off the United States.",
        "Iran is showing signs of attracting major foreign investment in its oil fields. That\u2019s good news for its economy, and it could make it harder for Donald Trump to reinstitute sanctions against the country should he try to fulfill his promise to rip up President Obama\u2019s controversial nuclear deal with Tehran. On Wednesday, Royal Dutch Shell PLC, more commonly known as Shell, announced that it was agreeing to develop major oil and gas fields in Iran for the first time since sanctions related to the country\u2019s nuclear deal were lifted at the beginning of the year.",
        "Nobody likes checked baggage fees. Nobody, that is, except airline executives. Last year, US carriers made nearly $4 billion from the fees. This year, they are on pace to make even more revenue from baggage fees, all of which avoids a 7. 5 percent tax from the Federal Aviation Administration that applies to the ticket price only. Whereas baggage fees used to be included in the price of a ticket, the adoption of checked baggage fees allows airlines to separate the charges. Lawmakers are now calling for baggage fees to be removed.",
        "One of the fundamental challenges for liberals, in the Trump regime, will be trying to hold on to their basic commitments to equality and inclusion, while facing the pressure to jettison some of those commitments when it would seem to be politically disadvantageous to be too liberal. As early as the 19th century, John Stuart Mill, whose work deeply influenced our ideas of liberalism, recognized that increased economic equality had not been accompanied by equality in terms of either gender or race.",
        "Donald Trump has given every sign that he wants to dismantle the multitude of environmental rules President Obama has put in place over the past eight years. He\u2019s vowed to tear up major climate regulations like the Clean Power Plan. His top pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, has sued to block nearly every pollution regulation the Obama administration has enacted. Pruitt will no doubt come in looking to make sweeping changes. That said, it\u2019s not yet clear how far Trump and Pruitt can actually go here.",
        "When I was 13, two FBI agents knocked on my family\u2019s door. They asked for my younger sister, at the time a in second grade at the school down the street from our home in New Jersey. My older sister, herself a teenager, fielded their questions, as my Pakistani parents, whose first language is Urdu, couldn\u2019t fully comprehend what the agents were asking. They told us that my sister\u2019s school had called the FBI to report that my sister may have placed anthrax in a permission slip for a field trip.",
        "Widespread ethnic cleansing, burning villages, looming starvation, and gang rape \u201cso prevalent that it\u2019s become \u2018normal. \u2019\u201d This is what UN experts found when they took a trip to the African country of South Sudan in late November. Since civil war broke out there in December 2013, as many as 50, 000 people have been killed. More than 2. 3 million people have been forced to flee their homes. Around 6 million people are currently at risk of going hungry, and 70 percent of schools have been closed due to the fighting. So what is the conflict actually about?",
        "In space, even the ordinary and the ugly takes on a new sense of wonder. When John Glenn was orbiting the Earth \u2014 the first American ever to do so \u2014 he noticed something strange and beautiful outside of his Friendship 7 spacecraft. \u201dI\u2019m in a big mass of thousands of very small particles that are brilliantly lit up like they\u2019re luminescent,\u201d Glenn radioed during the flight. \u201dThey are bright . About the size and intensity of a firefly on a real dark night.",
        "Donald Trump has a known tendency to agree with the last person he spoke to. By naming CEO Andy Puzder as his nominee for secretary of labor, Trump is guaranteeing that at least one of the people speaking to him will be an advocate for Trump to on his signature issue of immigration. As an executive in a industry dominated by \u201c \u201d workers (many of them immigrants, and often unauthorized immigrants) Puzder has been an outspoken supporter of immigration to the US \u2014 and of immigration reform that would legalize unauthorized immigrants who are already here.",
        "Throughout the 2016 election, the New York Times was heavily criticized for having a \u201cfalse equivalency\u201d problem. The critique was that the Times treated Hillary Clinton\u2019s problems, particularly emails and her work with the Clinton Foundation, as roughly equivalent to Donald Trump\u2019s problems \u2014 his racism, lies, and conflicts of interest, for example. Now the Times has given another example of this type of false equivalency, in one paragraph: Bias incidents on both sides have been reported. A student walking near campus was threatened with being lit on fire because she wore a hijab."
