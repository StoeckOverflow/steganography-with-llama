        "Last year, we learned about a troubling trend in the US population. Death rates were creeping up for white people, particularly women. The researchers who identified the problem in a blockbuster study attributed the change to economic struggles and accidental poisonings \u2014 mainly caused by prescription painkiller and heroin use. But a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a more disturbing finding: It\u2019s not just white folks who are dying sooner \u2014 it\u2019s everyone.",
        "The past few years have seen some progress for transgender people. Not only are they now much more visible in media thanks to TV shows like Transparent and Orange Is the New Black, but different levels of government have also taken steps to protect them from discrimination in the workplace, housing, schools, and other settings. And while North Carolina gained national attention for passing an bathroom law, the governor behind that measure just lost his reelection bid \u2014 in large part because of his law.",
        "Ten of America\u2019s most prominent media outlets ramped up their negative coverage of Hillary Clinton in the final two weeks of the presidential campaign while also writing fewer positive stories about her, according to a new report released today by Harvard University researchers. From late September to the middle of October \u2014 around the time of the presidential debates \u2014 the ratio of critical coverage of Clinton was roughly three positive stories for every two negative ones. But as the election headed to a close, that gap dramatically widened.",
        "Meat sucks. For as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve loved it. I still do. But recently, the love affair between meat and me has grown infinitely more complex. We\u2019ve taken a break and gotten back together multiple times. And about eight months ago, I met another type of meat with far less baggage; one month ago, I entered into a relationship with this new meat. Still with me?",
        "Donald Trump is a true master of getting attention, and he has been for decades. Where other New York developers built buildings, Trump built a brand based on always being the center of attention. Trump is so good at getting attention that his 2016 presidential campaign was long seen as essentially an stunt rather than a sincere effort to win. But one of the big lessons of the 2016 primary is that the ability to grab attention is a profoundly important part of winning a presidential nomination. A general election is different.",
        "The Ohio state legislature passed a bill Tuesday that would ban abortion before many women know they\u2019re pregnant, and that makes no exceptions for rape, incest, fetal anomaly, or a woman\u2019s health. The bill bans abortion as soon as a fetus\u2019s \u201cheartbeat\u201d is detected, which typically happens at around six weeks of pregnancy (but which doesn\u2019t involve a fully developed heart until about 20 weeks of pregnancy).",
        "\u2019s 2016 word of the year might be fascism. For betting types making early 2017 predictions, \u201cwhite nationalism\u201d would not be a bad guess. Along with \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d and the newer phrase \u201calternative right,\u201d or it\u2019s been a fixture of news and accompanying battles over politics, racism, and language. It started in earnest when it was announced that former Breitbart News editor Steve Bannon would serve as Donald Trump\u2019s administrative adviser. White nationalists like writer and publisher Andrew Anglin rejoiced.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s presidential transition team has asked the Department of Energy for the names of any federal employees who worked on certain aspects of climate policy during the Obama administration \u2014 a request that has some onlookers worried about a \u201c political witch hunt. \u201d In a memo first reported by Bloomberg and posted by E&E News here, Trump\u2019s team asked the Energy Department a series of 74 questions to prepare for the change in government control.",
        "\u201cDo you want more or fewer Moroccans in this city and in the Netherlands?\u201d Geert Wilders, the Netherlands\u2019 premier demagogue, asked a crowd in the Hague in 2014. \u201cFewer, fewer!\u201d they chanted. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of that,\u201d he promised. This remarks led to Wilders\u2019s being arrested and put on trial in March for inciting discrimination. On Friday, Dutch judges found him guilty of incitement, though the judge chose not to punish it with a fine. Wilders was entirely acquitted on a count of committing hate speech, a separate charge under Dutch law.",
        "America\u2019s Midwest is far from being the country\u2019s poorest region. To find the direst economic conditions in the United States, one generally has to look toward Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta region, the Rio Grande Valley, and a smattering of heavily Native American counties in the Southwest and Great Plains. What the Midwest\u2019s recent economic struggles bring, however, is not just political salience but a particular kind of fixability. The poorest places in the United States have been poor for a very long time and lack the basic infrastructure of prosperity.",
        "More than 700, 000 immigrants have no idea what their lives are going to look like six weeks from now. They\u2019re currently protected from deportation and allowed to work legally in the US under President Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program (which began in 2012) but Donald Trump could revoke those protections on day one of his presidency if he so chose. Trump reassured Time magazine on Wednesday that he\u2019d \u201cwork something out\u201d to help those immigrants. Now, Sens.",
        "Over the course of Elisabeth Poorman\u2019s first year of medical residency, she went from crying occasionally to tearing up every single day. \u201dI couldn\u2019t sleep even when I had time off,\u201d she said of the rapid decline in her mental health in 2013. \u201dI didn\u2019t really have any motivation to do anything when I wasn\u2019t at work.\u201d She\u2019d leave the clinic at Cambridge Health Alliance in Massachusetts feeling overwhelmed and sad. Then she\u2019d go home and sob. Her depression worsened before it got better. A year into her residency, Poorman decided to turn to a psychiatrist for help.",
        "Evidence is mounting that Russia is willing to do just about anything it takes to get an edge in international sports competitions. The World Agency (WADA) the premier international watchdog for monitoring athletes\u2019 use of illicit substances, released a report Friday accusing Moscow of running an elaborate doping scheme involving more than 1, 000 athletes from dozens of different sports. The investigation found evidence of urine sample swapping and operating on an \u201cunprecedented scale\u201d between 2011 and 2015, including during the 2014 Sochi Olympics.",
        "When Americans talk about corruption in politics, they usually mean the outsize influence corporations and the wealthy can exert in politics through campaign donations. But Donald Trump\u2019s administration risks a much more direct type of corruption, where the end goal is not donations to a reelection campaign but personal enrichment for the president himself. Trump\u2019s massive business empire \u2014 towering skyscrapers and sprawling golf courses, menswear and furniture, and his licensing of his personal \u201cbrand\u201d around the world \u2014 promises endless entanglements of business and politics. And we do not know the extent of the problem.",
        "The TV performance of the year belonged to Westworld\u2019s Evan Rachel Wood. She was closely followed, for my money, by Phoebe of Amazon\u2019s Fleabag. At first, the two would not seem to have that much in common; they\u2019re not even playing members of the same species. Wood plays Dolores, a robot who\u2019s slowly discovering she\u2019s trapped in hell \u2014 which takes the form of a theme park meant to entertain rich humans \u2014 on a show that sometimes (often) bites off more than it can chew.",
        "Donald Trump took to Twitter this week to blast Boeing and its specialized presidential aircraft, commonly known as Air Force One. \u201cBoeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion,\u201d Trump declared. \u201cCancel order!\u201d The social media comment quickly reverberated across both the Pentagon and the aviation industry. Within 30 minutes, Boeing\u2019s stock price had dropped by $2. The aviation firm flew into damage control mode, insisting taxpayers were getting the \u201cbest value\u201d for their money.",
        "Todd Marks has spent decades behind the scenes of major Hollywood projects. He puts screens onscreen \u2014 and that\u2019s a crucial part of cinematic world building. Marks and his company have worked on films ranging from 1995\u2019s thriller The Net to 2015\u2019s Steve Jobs. The above video shows some of the highlights of Marks\u2019s work, which involves putting images, videos, and other graphics onscreen so they can be filmed live along with the rest of the scene. That\u2019s a key choice when it comes to making realistic, cinematic worlds.",
        "Foster Campbell, a relatively unknown Democrat running for Louisiana\u2019s second Senate seat during the state\u2019s Saturday runoff race, has become the last Democrat left standing in the 2016 election. Campbell\u2019s campaign has come to represent the left\u2019s last chance to tighten the Republican Senate majority \u2014 and give Democrats more of a chance at stopping Trump from a cakewalk on his agenda of tax cuts, Obamacare rollback, and immigration enforcement. Campbell has raised more than $2. 5 million, including donations from TV personality Chelsea Handler, actress Sally Field, and comedians Patton Oswald and Rob Delaney.",
        "There has been a heated debate over the role that that economic factors played in the improbable journey that took Donald Trump all the way to the presidency. \u201cEconomic anxiety\u201d is the umbrella term that many pundits have seized on to explain what drove a substantial number of (white) voters to Trump. While economic anxiety is a somewhat vague concept, a decrease in prospects for social mobility is part of the story many have in mind. The New York Times columnist David Leonhardt offered a familiar version of this argument this week.",
        "Donald Trump is rumored to be considering fast food CEO Andy Puzder to be his secretary of labor. Like most of Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks so far, Puzder would probably dismantle or oppose key Obama priorities, like expanding overtime pay and raising the minimum wage. But what makes Puzder a particularly Trumpian pick is his attitude toward women. Like Trump, Puzder is very open about how much he enjoys objectifying women, and how he likes to use that objectification as a business strategy. Puzder is the CEO of CKE Restaurants, which operates Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardee\u2019s.",
        "Over the past few decades, especially in the wake of a series of Supreme Court decisions under conservative Chief Justice John Roberts (the most notable being Citizens United) the amount of private money flowing into US politics has ballooned. Presidential elections are now affairs. The ability to fundraise fantastic amounts of money is a prerequisite for even minor congressional races.",
        "For months, evidence has mounted that the Russian government used its hacking prowess to interfere with the US presidential election, stealing emails from Democrats and leaking them via WikiLeaks. The Obama administration formally accused Russia of hacking the Democrats two months ago. Now the CIA is going even further, according to reports from the Washington Post and the New York Times. In a \u201c briefing on Capitol Hill last week,\u201d intelligence officials told senators that \u201cit was now \u2018quite clear\u2019 that electing Trump was Russia\u2019s goal.",
        "Donald Trump nominated Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson as his secretary of state Tuesday morning, adding a corporate executive with extensive ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin to his presidential Cabinet. Tillerson has relationships with many world leaders, but has never served in government or taken public positions on many of the thorny issues he would confront as the nation\u2019s top diplomat. Tillerson, 64, has spent a decade as the CEO of Exxon, the largest oil company in the world.",
        "In superhero trailers, there\u2019s always one standout scene that\u2019s all anyone can talk about. The Fifty Shades of Grey franchise has the same type of thing \u2014 a sliver of footage from the movie that stands out amidst the rest. And in the new trailer for Fifty Shades Darker, the sequel to Fifty Shades of Grey, that standout moment involves Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) pretending to tie his shoe and then subsequently fondling Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) in a crowded elevator.",
        "Rating 2. 5 A big studio comedy requires a handful of ingredients: a bunch of talented character actors, some kind of novel but relatable situation, good jokes, and a selection of running gags that will get funnier as they recur over the course of the film. If it\u2019s the holidays, just set it in December and sprinkle in some humor, and voila! You\u2019ve got yourself a Christmas comedy. I suppose it\u2019s a sign of the times that this year\u2019s three big comedies \u2014 last month\u2019s dismal Bad Santa 2, the upcoming Why Him?",
        "In November, facing a wave of criticism for the role it had possibly played in helping to disseminate rhetoric and sweeping Donald Trump to victory, Twitter took drastic action. It conducted a purge of hundreds of accounts apparently belonging to members of the racist, misogynistic, bigoted online arm of white supremacy known as the . Saturday, however, Twitter not only reinstated but also one of the notable accounts it purged last month.",
        "In the 20 years it\u2019s been in space, the Cassini spacecraft has seen storms on Saturn\u2019s surface, sent a probe down to the planet\u2019s moon Titan, and shown us the eerie beauty of the gas giant\u2019s hexagonal north pole. As it is rapidly running out of fuel, it\u2019s been given one last mission before it goes offline in September: to solve the mystery of the planet\u2019s rings. \u201cWe\u2019re uncertain by quite a large margin about how much stuff is really there [in the rings],\u201d Preston Dyches, a NASA spokesperson for the Cassini mission, said in December.",
        "Every Sunday, we pick a new episode of the week. It could be good. It could be bad. It will always be interesting. You can read the archives here. The episodes of the week for December 4 through 10, 2016, are \u201cSymphony of Red Tape\u201d and \u201cNot Yet Titled,\u201d the sixth and seven episodes of Amazon comedy Mozart in the Jungle\u2019s third season. \u201cWhy am I still watching this show?\u201d I asked a Vox colleague, as I plodded through the first half of the third season of Mozart in the Jungle. It was, I suppose, a good question.",
        "President Barack Obama quietly made a little bit of history in 2016: He has officially used his clemency powers \u2014 to pardon and otherwise shorten people\u2019s sentences \u2014 more than any other president since Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1960s.",
        "After the election, Twitter issued a statement to Slate that it would \u201ctake action\u201d on any accounts that violated its harassment and hate speech policies: \u201cThe Twitter Rules prohibit violent threats, harassment, hateful conduct, and multiple account abuse, and we will take action on accounts violating those policies. . .. The Twitter Rules apply to all accounts, including verified accounts. \u201d Do Donald Trump\u2019s tweets fall into this category of actionable offenses? In a nutshell, yes. It\u2019s no secret that Trump\u2019s statements on Twitter have been controversial, viewed by many as bullying, inflammatory, and divisive."
