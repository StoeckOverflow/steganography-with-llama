        "Donald Trump has a problem. He\u2019s remarkably unpopular for a new president, so he needs to win over more voters in order to be reelected. At the same time, he needs to keep a conservative coalition that wants to enact sweeping and controversial policy changes united behind him. In recent days, we\u2019ve started to get a sense of how he may try to pull off both. First, Trump will use the bully pulpit \u2014 through Twitter, through the media, and through his own staged events \u2014 to preserve his brand.",
        "A CNN special that aired December 8 included rare, candid moments in which Barack Obama and his former adviser David Axelrod each acknowledged that racism contributed to negative attitudes toward the first black president. \u201dI think there\u2019s a reason why attitudes about my presidency among whites in Northern states are very different from whites in Southern states,\u201d Obama told Fareed Zakaria in an interview for \u201cThe Legacy of Barack Obama. \u201d \u201dAre there folks whose primary concern about me has been that I seem foreign, the other? Are those who champion the \u2019birther\u2019 movement feeding off of bias?",
        "Donald Trump is floating the possibility of dropping Washington\u2019s \u201cOne China\u201d policy, the diplomatic understanding on the status of Taiwan that has helped keep relations relatively stable for four decades. In an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Trump painted the possible move as an opening gambit for negotiations with China on issues like trade and the country\u2019s expansion into the South China Sea. The comments came just days after Trump\u2019s call with Taiwan\u2019s president raised alarms last week in both Washington and Beijing.",
        "Some of the world\u2019s biggest oil producers are trying to see if they can hike global crude oil prices by artificially throttling production. So far, they\u2019ve been stunningly successful \u2014 with \u201cso far\u201d being the key term here. On Tuesday, the price of Brent crude oil rose to $56 per barrel, the highest level since . The impetus?",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign is calling for the members of the Electoral College to receive an intelligence briefing on possible Russian interference in the presidential election before that body makes the results official on December 19. With just one week before the Electoral College vote, Clinton campaign chair John Podesta released a statement today supporting a movement by some of the electors to receive the intelligence briefing.",
        "The regulations that oversee the prescription drug industry and protect consumers from dangerous products are surprisingly fragile and young. In wasn\u2019t until 1962 that the Food and Drug Administration starting asking drug companies to prove their products were both safe and effective before they hit the market. Until that time there were some standards related to adulteration and labeling, but otherwise it was mostly a free for all. It took the infamous scandal around thalidomide, a medication that caused severe birth defects, to strengthen the FDA. An FDA medical officer, Dr.",
        "Progressives have long been skeptical of federalism, with the role that \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d played in the resistance to the civil rights act and desegregation typically featuring prominently in their criticism. Its ugly history even led one scholar to insist that \u201cif one disapproves of racism, one should disapprove of federalism. \u201d Even now, with every national institution in the hands of the GOP, progressives associate federalism with conservatism and shy away from invoking the language of federalism to change the policies they oppose. That is a mistake. Federalism doesn\u2019t have a political valence.",
        "Explosive reports over the weekend from the Washington Post and the New York Times indicate that the CIA is now prepared to clearly state what Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and her allies have long maintained \u2014 that emails stolen from her campaign chair John Podesta and provided to WikiLeaks were hacked in order to help make Donald Trump president of the United States. In a \u201c briefing on Capitol Hill last week,\u201d intelligence officials told senators that \u201cit was now \u2018quite clear\u2019 that electing Trump was Russia\u2019s goal.",
        "\u201dPresidents have a right to do things in their spare time, in their leisure time,\u201d Kellyanne Conway recently told CNN of her boss, Donald Trump. The question at hand was whether Trump should continue as an executive producer on NBC\u2019s The Celebrity Apprentice. Conway said that if Trump remained involved with the show, it would be no different from Barack Obama playing golf \u2014 a hobby, something fun that Trump could do when not running the country.",
        "When scientists talk about the greenhouse gases that are causing global warming, they typically focus on far and away the most important one, carbon dioxide, which is emitted when humans burn fossil fuels or clear forests. The world is actually making slow progress on CO2 \u2014 there\u2019s been no growth in annual CO2 emissions for the past three years, thanks to a slowdown in coal burning in China.",
        "On August 9, 2014, Michael Brown was shot and killed in Ferguson, Missouri. The shooter was Darren Wilson, a veteran of the Ferguson Police Department. At the time, not much was known about the circumstances surrounding the shooting, apart from the fact that an unarmed black man was shot by a white police officer. In a place like Ferguson, a suburb with an overwhelmingly white police force and a history of racial profiling, that was enough to set off weeks of protests. Ferguson was the beginning of something bigger.",
        "The 2017 Golden Globes, hosted by Jimmy Fallon, will be awarded on Sunday, January 8, with the ceremony airing live at 8 pm EST on NBC. With a reputation for being one of the most \u201cfun\u201d shows of awards season due to how early they fall in the season, the presence of alcohol (and thereby tipsy celebrities) and general unpredictability with regard to the winners, they\u2019re usually a pretty good time as far as awards shows are concerned.",
        "Donald Trump was supposed to give Americans a fuller picture of how he\u2019d separate himself from business as president at a press conference on December 15. Instead, he canceled the press conference and sent two tweets. Trump\u2019s plan to separate himself from his conflict of interest is to let his sons \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump \u2014 and his executives manage his businesses, and to pledge that \u201cno new deals will be done during my term( s) in office.",
        "Meteor showers are typically the result of the Earth passing through the trail of a comet. The bits of rock and debris burn up when they hit the Earth\u2019s dense atmosphere, and streak across the sky. The Geminids \u2014 which radiate out of the constellation Gemini and reach their peak Tuesday night \u2014 are not a typical meteor shower. If you go outside Tuesday night and watch, you\u2019ll be seeing bits of debris from an asteroid named 3200 Phaeton burn up in the night sky. What\u2019s more, those asteroid bits are denser than typical meteor kindling.",
        "Ohio got a lot of attention last week for passing an extreme \u201cheartbeat\u201d bill that would ban all abortion after a fetal pulse can be detected \u2014 or at around six weeks of pregnancy, which is before many women know they\u2019re pregnant. The bill\u2019s passage on December 6 sparked a flurry of activism, with social media posts urging people to call Gov. John Kasich and tell him to veto the abortion ban. On Tuesday, Kasich did indeed veto the ban.",
        "Alan Thicke has died at the age of 69. Thicke, according to TMZ, had a heart attack while playing hockey with his son Carter, and was pronounced dead at Providence St. Joseph\u2019s Medical Center in Burbank. Thicke, for a generation of television watchers, was known as the bright and goofy Dr. Jason Roland Seaver on \u201980s sitcom Growing Pains, which ran from . Thicke\u2019s Seaver was a goofy, charming father to four children, and the show approached topics from drinking and driving to the effect that careers have on a marriage.",
        "Today, the National Weather Service warned residents of Bismarck, North Dakota, to expect a high of 10 degrees Fahrenheit and windchill of minus 35 degrees Fahrenheit. In those conditions, frostbite can occur in 30 minutes on exposed skin. The forecast for Bismarck on Saturday includes an overnight low of minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit. At that temperature, vodka freezes solid. The \u201cpolar vortex\u201d has come for the Upper Midwest. And it\u2019s not stopping there.",
        "Did a typo really help cause the Clinton campaign\u2019s loss in 2016? A new report in the New York Times looks at how Russian hackers and WikiLeaks got access to campaign chair John Podesta\u2019s emails, leading to months of negative coverage surrounding the contents of the emails \u2014 which, in a election, may have been the last straw for the Clinton campaign.",
        "Aleppo is falling. Syrian regime forces, backed by Iran and Russian airstrikes, are on the verge of retaking the final remnants of the eastern portion of the city, where tens of thousands of civilians are trapped with no way of escape. A ceasefire deal, brokered by Russia and Turkey on Tuesday, was supposed to let civilians and rebels withdraw \u2014 but the Assad regime appears to have rejected it. His troops are fighting rebels in vicious combat. As regime forces have entered rebel territory, reports of mass killings have stunned the world.",
        "CORBIN, Kentucky \u2014 Kathy Oller is so committed to her job signing up fellow Kentuckians for Obamacare that last Halloween, she dressed up as a cat, set up a booth at a event, and urged people to get on the rolls. She\u2019s enrolled so many people in the past three years that she long ago lost count. Update: Watch interview with President Obama on the future of Obamacare \u201cMust be somewhere in the thousands,\u201d she said to me one morning at a local buffet restaurant where she\u2019d just finished an enrollment event with the staff.",
        "CORBIN, Kentucky \u2014 Why would people vote for a presidential candidate who campaigned on taking away their health insurance? Last week, we went to Corbin, Kentucky, to try to answer that question. It\u2019s a small city in southeastern Kentucky, an area of the country that has seen huge declines in its uninsured rate \u2014 but also voted overwhelmingly for Trump. You can read more about what we learned there in this story, but we also wanted to give you the transcripts of the conversations we had so the people we talked to could speak for themselves.",
        "Back in 2011, during the GOP presidential primary, Rick Perry spoke during a debate and tried to list the three federal agencies he\u2019d abolish if elected to the White House. \u201cAnd I will tell you,\u201d Perry said, \u201cit is three agencies of government when I get there that are gone. Commerce, Education, and the \u2026 what\u2019s the third one there? Let\u2019s see.\u201d Then he stumbled. He couldn\u2019t recall the third. When coaxed by other candidates and the moderator \u2014 did he mean the Environmental Protection Agency, maybe? \u2014 he drew a blank.",
        "People die in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. A lot of them. They die horrible deaths in spaceship crashes. They\u2019re cut down by light sabers. They\u2019re obliterated by giant explosions. They die brutally and nastily and quickly. They die, as most of us do, with unfinished business. In one terrible sequence, whole swaths of people are mowed down by an advancing enemy, as they try desperately to accomplish the one thing they need to do to get the Death Star plans to the Rebel Alliance. Rating 3.",
        "We recently learned that for the first time in decades, Americans are dying a little bit earlier \u2014 and mortality rates have increased for a number of causes of death. But we\u2019ve seen very little explanation on precisely where in the country this public health crisis is most acute. Recent studies from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, published in JAMA in December and May, map out mortality trends by county and cause.",
        "The spin war Donald Trump and his subordinates are waging over the question of Russian hacking is raising serious questions about how his administration will function \u2014 because they\u2019re sending the message that the White House will refuse to accept facts that doesn\u2019t meet its own propaganda narrative.",
        "Representatives from most of America\u2019s technology companies met with Donald Trump at Trump Tower today. But there was a conspicuous absence: Twitter. The irony, of course, is that Twitter is Trump\u2019s preferred communication platform. But Politico\u2019s Nancy Scola reports that this wasn\u2019t an oversight. The Trump transition team deliberately snubbed Twitter in retaliation for a dispute over a custom emoji advertising deal. The Trump campaign, for its part, denies the Politico report, arguing that Twitter was simply too small to make the cut.",
        "In the wake of the election, perhaps no topic has been more widely discussed and debated than the \u201c \u201d \u2014 the racist, sexist, mostly movement associated with radical white supremacy that has unexpectedly taken center stage in US politics after the election of Donald Trump. Though many consider the to be primarily a fringe movement encompassing multiple ideologies (including white nationalism and white supremacy) its supporters\u2019 unorthodox tactics for promoting those ideologies were fundamental to Trump\u2019s campaign, and thus fundamental to his victory.",
        "Three years ago, Angelina Jolie announced in a New York Times that she\u2019d had a preventive double mastectomy after testing positive for mutations in the BRCA1 gene, which put her at an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers. The article went hugely viral, and became a flashpoint in the debate about breast cancer risk and prevention. It also spurred a bunch of researchers to study what impact Jolie\u2019s decision might have on mastectomy rates and testing for the BRCA1 and 2 genetic mutations.",
        "I started 2016 as chief film critic at Christianity Today and ended it on staff here at Vox. Religion and pop culture has been my beat for a long while. So it\u2019s not surprising I spot it around every corner. But even by my heightened radar\u2019s standards, 2016 feels like a banner year for onscreen treatments of religion.",
        "The nation\u2019s federal employees appear to have just won their first big clash with Donald Trump\u2019s transition team. Or at least it looks that way. Last week, Bloomberg unearthed a questionnaire that Trump\u2019s team had sent to the Department of Energy to prepare for the change in government control."
