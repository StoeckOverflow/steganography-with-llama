        "A child born in 1940 had an extremely good chance of growing up to earn more money than his parents did. Due to regression to the mean, children of the very, very wealthy were somewhat less likely to their parents (if your dad is Jeff Bezos, it\u2019s hard to beat that no matter how many advantages you have in life). But from the bottom of the income distribution all the way up to the 95th percentile or so, families were extremely likely to experience upward mobility. For kids born in 1980, that\u2019s much less true.",
        "With Secretary of Labor Tom Perez reportedly planning to announce this week that he\u2019ll run for Democratic National Committee chair, the race for that marquee office will soon be in full swing. And as the party struggles to find its way in a era, many of the people inside and close to the DNC I\u2019ve spoken with in recent weeks say they hope the race for chair will remain focused on the substantive ideas each candidate proposes for rebuilding the party \u2014 but they fear it could become a sequel to the bitter 2016 primary fight.",
        "This week, Donald Trump canceled a press conference on his private business dealings, saying he was too busy nominating Cabinet members. Despite repeatedly lambasting Hillary Clinton for not facing the press during the campaign, Trump has not held a press conference since July 27.",
        "The unrelenting bloodshed in Syria has managed to get even worse with the fall of the rebel stronghold of Aleppo, where months of airstrikes by Syrian and Russian warplanes have killed enormous numbers of civilians and reduced much of the city to rubble.",
        "The holidays are approaching, and a lot of people are thinking about ways they can give to the needy in their communities \u2014 and ways they can clear out space in the closet to make room for the imminent influx of gifts. Giving to your local thrift store can be a great way to do both at the same time. The question is, what to give? Is your aunt\u2019s old chair (the one your cat sleeps on every night) going to be a great little vintage find for someone on a budget?",
        "On Tuesday, Donald Trump tapped ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to be his secretary of state. And one aspect of this pick is that Exxon could potentially have billions of dollars at stake in one of the biggest foreign policy decisions Trump will consider over the next few years \u2014 whether to maintain sanctions on Russia. Exxon, the world\u2019s largest oil company, has long had its eye on Russia\u2019s vast oil and gas deposits.",
        "Today the leaders of America\u2019s most important technology companies \u2014 including Google Larry Page, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos \u2014 will go to Trump Tower to meet with the . Silicon Valley moguls overwhelmingly backed Trump\u2019s opponent in the November election, so the meeting is bound to be somewhat awkward. But it\u2019s also likely to be the first step toward developing a working relationship between Trump\u2019s administration and an industry that wields outsized influence over the American economy and society.",
        "Here at Vox, we\u2019re big fans of clever graphics and visualizations that make climate change, which can sometimes seem abstract and impenetrably complex, easier to grasp. We\u2019ve highlighted several this year (see here, here, and here) more than one of them from University of Reading climate scientist Ed Hawkins, who seems to have a real eye for these things. Helpfully, Hawkins has rounded up his own favorite climate visualizations from the year in one place \u2014 graphics showing the rise in temperatures, the rise in CO2 concentrations, the melting of Arctic ice, and more.",
        "Americans worried that Donald Trump will try to shred the nation\u2019s social welfare programs can take some grim comfort by looking south: No matter what Republicans do, it will pale in comparison with the changes that are about to ravage Brazil. On Thursday, a new constitutional amendment goes into effect in Brazil that effectively freezes federal government spending for two decades.",
        "Democrats have a real fight on their hands for party chair. On Thursday, Labor Secretary Tom Perez announced that he would be running Democratic National Committee chair \u2014 a key leadership and fundraising position for the party during the upcoming Donald Trump years. His stiffest competition comes from Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, a of the Progressive Caucus who has secured the backing of Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Chuck Schumer, and a host of labor groups.",
        "Speaking in early December at a ceremony to honor Harry Reid\u2019s retirement from the US Senate, Hillary Clinton took aim at a target that would have been totally unfamiliar to audiences as recently as the summer of 2016: fake news. She spoke of \u201can epidemic\u201d of the stuff that has \u201cflooded social media\u201d over the past year and \u201ccan have consequences. \u201d This was reported largely as commentary on the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which had recently led to an alarming armed standoff at DC\u2019s Comet Ping Pong restaurant.",
        "The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates, doing so for only the second time since the 2008 financial crisis. The move reflects the Fed\u2019s growing confidence that the economy is on a sustainable growth footing \u2014 and its judgment that inflation is becoming a bigger danger to the US economy than sluggish growth or another recession. A central bank like the Fed faces a basic between economic growth and inflation. When the Fed cuts interest rates \u2014 or keeps them low \u2014 more cash flows into the economy and business tends to boom.",
        "Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte promised to kill 100, 000 criminals within his first six months in office and said there would be so many corpses in Manila Bay that the \u201cfish will grow fat. \u201d Turns out the controversial leader may have some firsthand experience: On Monday, Duterte claimed that he\u2019d personally killed criminal suspects during his time as mayor of his home city of Davao. \u201dIn Davao I used to do it personally.",
        "In the wake of the 2016 election, Facebook has been receiving an ongoing wave of criticism for its handling of fake news in its newsfeed used by more than a billion daily users. Initially, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg dismissed concerns about fake news, arguing that it was a \u201cpretty crazy idea\u201d to blame Facebook for Donald Trump\u2019s upset win. Zuckerberg\u2019s blas\u00e9 response triggered a fierce debate inside the social media giant. And now Facebook is changing its tune in a dramatic way.",
        "Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill agree on something: The Russian government\u2019s interference in the presidential election needs an investigation. The agreement ends there. The parties are pushing very different approaches for how to investigate. Democrats are calling for the most aggressive option \u2014 a special bipartisan committee somewhat similar to the commission that would act independent of the normal course of congressional business and give them subpoena powers they\u2019d otherwise lack. Sen. Mitch McConnell and other Republicans think that goes too far. Instead, they want to go a standard route, deferring investigations to existing committees.",
        "Donald Trump is using his bully pulpit to falsely allege that millions of ballots were cast illegally and to suggest that early voting should be cut down. Under his leadership, politicians with records of aggressively curtailing voting rights will be shaping federal policies. At the state level, Republicans have long been leading a sustained assault on voting rights. Access to the franchise is now the object of an political battle. Those committed to protecting people\u2019s right to vote \u2014 as well as their actual ability to exercise this right \u2014 must organize accordingly.",
        "Since July 2015, when a series of propaganda videos attacking Planned Parenthood were released, at least two dozen states have tried to \u201cdefund\u201d the organization \u2014 despite warnings from the Obama administration that doing so was probably illegal. On Wednesday, however, the Obama administration finalized a rule clarifying that states definitely can\u2019t keep Planned Parenthood from receiving public family planning funds \u2014 at least not just because it provides abortions. The rule covers Title X, the only federal program dedicated to family planning for people.",
        "It was a foggy morning in March. I was new to the neighborhood, having moved to Berlin a few days before. My jet lag kept me awake until the early hours of the morning. I needed to clear my head. I was wearing a black track jacket, a pair of leggings, and my bright purple and orange running sneakers. I heard someone yelling at me on the other side of the track. I remember my headphones getting tangled in my headband as I struggled to pull them out.",
        "Around 3. 6 million years ago, a pair of Australopithecus afarensis \u2014 a species of ancient ancestor made famous by the fossil Lucy \u2014 were walking through wet mud in Laetoli, Tanzania. This was likely just an ordinary day, but then something extraordinary happened: A nearby volcano erupted, covering their freshly made footprints in ash, preserving their shape, and locking this moment in time. We know very little about the Australopithecus, a hominid species that may be our ancestral link to the apes. Basic facts, like whether they could climb trees, are subjects of scientific debate.",
        "Why does Rectify work? The Sundance drama follows a man named Daniel Holden (Aden Young) who is released from death row after 19 years, and the family that tries to make room for him in their lives after all that time. It ended its run Wednesday, December 14 with a terrific, soulful finale, filled with perfectly realized moments and the sense of life moving ever forward. Not everything is resolved, because that\u2019s not how life works. In reality, a story doesn\u2019t end when you tell it to.",
        "Donald Trump is enamored of his new hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC. He even took time away from the campaign trail for it \u2014 including turning a press conference about his previous false allegation that President Obama hadn\u2019t been born in the US into a giant advertisement for the property. At the time, when the consensus was that Trump would lose, this made sense for his future. But now that Trump is moving up the street to the White House, the hotel has become something else: a blatant conflict of interest.",
        "Pamela Ramsey Taylor, the director of a Clay County, West Virginia, nonprofit who was removed from her post after she called Michelle Obama an \u201cape in heels\u201d in a November Facebook post, will be back on the job December 23, the Charleston reported Monday. That\u2019s right, she wasn\u2019t fired by the Clay County Development Corp. Though the initial headlines claimed she \u201clost her job,\u201d she was just temporarily suspended. While Clay County Mayor Beverly Whaling stepped down permanently after commenting that Taylor\u2019s racist Facebook post, \u201cjust made my day,\u201d Taylor will return to work by Christmas.",
        "How would American media cover Russia\u2019s hack of the US election if it happened in another country? How would the world respond differently? Here, to borrow a great idea from Slate\u2019s Joshua Keating, is a satirical take on the story you might be reading if the reports about Russian meddling were coming from, say, Estonia or Venezuela. All facts are real; all quotes are not. WASHINGTON \u2014 In November, flamboyant oligarch Donald Trump was elected to be the next president of the United States. But now, many in the fiercely independent nation are experiencing buyer\u2019s remorse because of Mr.",
        "Thursday morning, the House Freedom Caucus, the main group representing the far right of House Republicans, released an ambitious regulatory \u2014 or, really, deregulatory \u2014 agenda for the Trump administration to pursue. It consists of a detailed, list of regulations, mostly imposed during President Obama\u2019s administration, that it would like to see repealed or rolled back. The Trump administration likely won\u2019t do 100 percent of what\u2019s on the menu here, but in his Cabinet appointments Trump has largely assembled a team of conservatives, so it\u2019s a good look at the direction policy is likely to take.",
        "In the wake of the 2016 election, Facebook had a problem. A lot of people thought the site had done too little to combat fake news. At the same time, Facebook was desperate to maintain its reputation as a politically innocuous technology company. If it started directly declaring certain news stories fake, it would inevitably be drawn into emotionally charged political fights, damaging its credibility with partisans in the process. So instead of trying to identify fake news itself, Facebook is outsourcing the work to third parties. Initially, five organizations \u2014 Snopes, PolitiFact, Factcheck.",
        "A prominent Republican got fewer votes than his opponent, but his party is rushing to enact sweeping changes that would limit the power of Democrats, potentially locking them out of for cycles to come. No, this isn\u2019t Donald Trump, and it isn\u2019t Republicans in Congress. In North Carolina, during late night session on Wednesday, the state legislature introduced a series of bills deliberately meant to cut the powers of the governor\u2019s office and the state\u2019s election oversight board.",
        "Aleppo has fallen. In December, after an extended siege and a month of intense fighting, Bashar \u2019s forces seized control of the eastern half of the city. A withdrawal agreement allowed thousands of rebels and civilians to evacuate \u2014 but not before Assad\u2019s forces massacred and tortured an unknown number of people. The Assad victory was a humanitarian disaster and a devastating blow to the embattled rebels \u2014 and something that was in the works for over a year. The above video explains why. How we got to this disaster Aleppo used to be a lovely place.",
        "Donald Trump ran for president on a platform of, among other things, strident opposition to the Partnership (TPP) trade agreement that the Obama administration negotiated and that most congressional Republicans supported. Trump said that while NAFTA was \u201cthe worst trade deal in the history of the country,\u201d the TPP was even worse, posing \u201cthe greatest danger yet\u201d to American jobs and prosperity. \u201cIt\u2019s a rape of our country,\u201d he said at an Ohio rally. \u201cIt\u2019s a harsh word, but that\u2019s what it is \u2014 rape of our country.",
        "Donald Trump won last month\u2019s presidential election. But many liberals and progressives are still clinging to one faint, hope that he can be blocked from the presidency \u2014 through the Electoral College. That\u2019s because the November 8 vote was technically not to make Trump president, but only to determine who 538 electors in various states across the country will be. It is those electors who will cast the votes that legally elect the president on Monday, December 19.",
        "Michelle Obama has a strikingly successful record of fighting the obesity epidemic and improving nutrition \u2014 both symbolically and through legislation. Back in October, I talked to a bunch of food and nutrition policy wonks about the first lady\u2019s influence on food issues. They offered praise: She planted a garden, waged snappy social media campaigns, and worked behind the scenes with researchers, lawmakers, heads of government departments, schools, and food giants to quietly change what Americans eat."
