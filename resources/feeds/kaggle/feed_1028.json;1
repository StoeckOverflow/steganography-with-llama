        "On Thursday, Donald Trump announced his pick for ambassador to Israel: a bankruptcy lawyer named David Friedman. Friedman, who has been a personal friend of Trump\u2019s for about 15 years, has no government experience to speak of. What Friedman does have is opinions \u2014 specifically, what appears to be the most approach to the conflict of any US ambassador to Israel in history. Friedman has called the solution \u201ca suicidal \u2018peace\u2019 with hateful radical Islamists hell bent on Israel\u2019s destruction.",
        "Barack Obama has vowed to take retaliatory action against Russia for using cyber attacks to interfere with the US election process \u2014 with just five weeks left before Donald Trump, arguably the most openly incoming president in recent memory, takes office. \u201dI think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections \u2026 we need to take action,\u201d Obama said in an interview that aired on NPR\u2019s Morning Edition on Friday. \u201cAnd we will \u2014 at a time and place of our own choosing.",
        "John Podesta is tearing into the FBI. In an published Friday in the Washington Post, Hillary Clinton\u2019s former campaign chair didn\u2019t just fault the bureau for devoting too many resources to investigating her private email server \u2014 or for not doing enough to go after evidence that the Russian government was hacking the election to help Donald Trump.",
        "By far one of the most important impacts of global warming in the decades ahead will be rise. As the Earth heats up and ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica melt, ocean levels will creep upward, flooding coastal cities and forcing relocations around the world. But there\u2019s a troubling asterisk here: We still don\u2019t know exactly how high oceans are likely to rise this century.",
        "When Hillary Clinton lost the presidency to Donald Trump, the left started grasping for an explanation. Mark Lilla, a liberal political theorist at Columbia University and author of The Shipwrecked Mind, offered one in a New York Times essay published shortly after the election: The Clinton campaign spent too much time appealing to what he calls \u201cidentity liberalism. \u201d Lilla\u2019s thesis is that the left\u2019s exaltation of diversity is \u201ca splendid principle of moral pedagogy, but disastrous as a foundation for democratic politics in our ideological age.",
        "Sen. Lindsay Graham of South Carolina is one of the GOP\u2019s leading hawks and an Donald Trump critic. He\u2019s also become the first Republican senator to offer a clearly negative take on a major Trump appointee, Exxon CEO and Russian Order of Friendship member Rex Tillerson. Speaking to Fox News, Graham says \u201cit would be very hard\u201d to vote for Tillerson unless he breaks with Trump, clearly blames Russia for hacking, and offers some kind of countermeasures in response. Sen.",
        "Unless he divests himself from all his businesses, Donald Trump is laying the groundwork to violate the Constitution of the United States the second he takes office. But he\u2019s not president yet. On December 19, the 538 members of the Electoral College have to cast their votes, and a majority of them have to vote in favor of Trump for him to earn the title. He may have won \u2014 sorry, did I say win? I mean lost \u2014 the popular vote by a margin larger than any other president in history.",
        "Repealing Obamacare wouldn\u2019t just end health coverage for 20 million people. It would also mean a significant tax cut for the wealthiest Americans. These tax figures are important for understanding why Republicans are so committed to Obamacare repeal. It\u2019s not just about delivering on a campaign promise to get rid of President Obama\u2019s signature legislative accomplishment. It\u2019s also about providing a significant tax cut to the top 1 percent of earners. The Affordable Care Act includes many new taxes, often levied on the Americans to help finance the expansion of health coverage for citizens. This includes a 3.",
        "According to the internet, people in Generation Z \u2014 those born in 1996 or later \u2014 are socially disconnected creatures with the attention span of a lizard. Forbes describes them as kids who \u201chave never known a world without smartphones and social media,\u201d and who, as a result, \u201cgobble up information quickly\u201d and have no attention span. It is apparently impossible to speak with them, a branding expert told the New York Times last year, unless one \u201ccommunicates in five words and a big picture.",
        "Surveying the wreckage after the last election, Democratic political operative David Brock called for \u201ca Breitbart of the left. \u201d It\u2019s difficult to imagine what a Breitbart of the left might look like. Would it support a hostility to enemies of the revolution, a supremacy to mirror white nationalism? Would it feature a comments section that makes a fetish of demonizing the right? Would Brock become the left\u2019s Steve Bannon, part propagandizer, part political Svengali? He didn\u2019t say.",
        "After the slippery wintry precipitation of Winter Storm Stella, it\u2019s time to reclaim the sidewalks and roads. But walking on icy surfaces requires special attention to avoid slipping and falling. Falls are the cause of unintentional deaths. With snow and ice affecting the North East for the next several hours, it\u2019s good to have a plan to stay upright. And it\u2019s an easy plan, too: Walk like a penguin. Does it look silly to waddle down the street? Absolutely.",
        "Television boasts a unique quality that few other forms of media can claim: Its recurring format allows it to regularly come into your home, to become part of your everyday routines. You can follow its stories and characters for weeks, months, years. But sometimes TV is less about the journey and more about those special moments that jog you awake, make you laugh, make you ache, make you think.",
        "President Barack Obama has spent his two terms in office working to build closer ties with China while seeking to isolate and punish Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. Eight years later, Moscow is subject to painful US sanctions and continued public criticism from Obama and his aides. Beijing is a key economic partner that has at times served as a conduit to the rogue regime in North Korea. To a large extent, that\u2019s because the two countries have acted fairly differently in recent years.",
        "Russia was in the news again this week after President Obama vowed to retaliate against the country for cyberattacks it carried out during the 2016 presidential election, cyberattacks that potentially helped Donald Trump win. This didn\u2019t go unnoticed by Saturday Night Live, which dedicated the cold open of its final episode of 2016 to Alec Baldwin\u2019s Trump receiving a special visit by a shirtless Vladimir Putin (Beck Bennett).",
        "Few consumer products offer as staggering a range of choice as wine. You can buy a bottle of Dark Horse Big Red Blend for $8. Or for around $500, you can get a 2012 bottle of Sloan Proprietary Red. Yet for each bottle, the same question applies: Is it any good? For decades, Americans turned to professional critics like Robert Parker to help them make that determination. But the internet changed all that.",
        "If you want to find out how many Latino people are arrested in the US every year, you\u2019re out of luck: 40 of 50 states publicly report race in their arrest records, but 38 states haven\u2019t regularly or recently included Latinos in their race or ethnicity arrest data. And that makes it impossible to fully tell how many Latino people are arrested in most states on an annual basis.",
        "The 1991 and 1992 models of the Buick LeSabre are two fairly similar cars. The one big difference? The \u201991 edition is angular and boxy, and the \u201992 edition is round and curvy. That might seem like a small difference year to year, but the change is actually representative of a much bigger trend in automotive design. In the late 1970s, a spike in gas prices set in motion a stronger emphasis on aerodynamic design for American cars.",
        "Every Sunday, we pick a new episode of the week. It could be good. It could be bad. It will always be interesting. You can read the archives here. The episode of the week for December 11 through 17, 2016, is \u201cChapter Ten: Three Rooms\u201d the first season finale of Fox\u2019s The Exorcist. Making a TV version of The Exorcist is, ostensibly, a terrible idea. The story from the famous book and movie about a teenage girl possessed by a particularly vile demon is the sort of thing that could fall apart the longer you extend it.",
        "How best to describe The OA, Netflix\u2019s new \u2026 well, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to figure out here \u2014 how to describe this thing. At times, it feels like the sort of show that would be a background joke in an episode of BoJack Horseman something Jack Donaghy would pitch on 30 Rock.",
        "When Donald Trump won the presidential election in November, some liberals and activists had a idea. What if, they mused, they could in fact block his win through the Electoral College, which actually casts the ballots that will officially make Trump president? But when the electors gathered across the country Monday, this plot backfired embarrassingly \u2014 more electors defected from Hillary Clinton than from Trump.",
        "German authorities say that they are unsure if the man they\u2019ve arrested on suspicion of plowing a truck through a popular outdoor Christmas market in Berlin Monday night is the perpetrator of the act. The truck was traveling around 40 mph when it jumped the sidewalk and plowed into people around market stands, finally coming to a halt near Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, a busy tourist site in western Berlin.",
        "Coates\u2019s book, Between the World and Me, won the National Book Award. He\u2019s writing the (awesome) Black Panther series for Marvel. He\u2019s a certified MacArthur Genius. And he\u2019s a writer at the Atlantic, where he just released a blockbuster cover story based on hours of interviews with President Barack Obama about the role race played in the president\u2019s upbringing, his White House, and the 2016 campaign. I spoke with Coates for my podcast this week.",
        "No lack of urgent wordsmithing has emerged in recent weeks to describe the human tragedy befalling Aleppo. Waves of compassion, empathy, anger, and despair now wash up against the name of the Syrian city. The cost of human life and political loss is hard to comprehend. Last week\u2019s outpouring of \u201cgoodbye\u201d posts from activists and residents of East Aleppo pushed the frustration of bystanders and witnesses outside the stronghold of the Syrian Revolution to a collective breaking point. With renewed urgency, we asked, we cried out, and were asked again: What can be done watching this misery?",
        "Before the election, it was common to hear experts say the \u201cculture wars\u201d were over, and that the left had won. True, there were debates about how progressives could most effectively consolidate their gains, and about whether they should be magnanimous in victory. But participants in these debates shared an assumption that, for instance, women\u2019s right to choose and marriage equality were secure. After the election, all that has changed. Although some liberals and progressives hold out hope that President Trump is uninterested in certain social issues, like marriage and transgender rights, their optimism is misplaced.",
        "Frank Loesser\u2019s 1944 \u201cBaby, It\u2019s Cold Outside\u201d has been a beloved staple for decades, covered by legendary pairings from Johnny Mercer and Margaret Whiting in 1949 to Idina Menzel and Michael Bubl\u00e9 in 2014. When you first hear it, the song seems like a cute, flirty duet between a man and his lady friend who are debating whether she should stay the night. On the one hand, what would her parents or the neighbors think? On the other hand, it\u2019s just so cold outside.",
        "Today, more than a month past Election Day, the 2016 election officially ends; the states have certified the results, and the Electoral College will almost certainly vote to install Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States. Most \u2014 including experts, pollsters, and even some in Trump\u2019s own campaign \u2014 didn\u2019t see this coming. When it happened, there was a scramble to figure out how it did.",
        "In a stunning act of political violence, a man in a black suit and tie shot and killed Russia\u2019s ambassador to Turkey on Monday in what the assassin described as an act of revenge for Russia\u2019s bombing of civilians in Aleppo, Syria. Video captured at the scene shows the gunman shouting \u201cAllahu akbar,\u201d the Arabic phrase for \u201cGod is great,\u201d as well as the Arabic words for \u201cRemember Syria! Remember Aleppo!\u201d as the ambassador, Andrey Karlov, lies bleeding on the floor next to him.",
        "It\u2019s not something most people in my life know about. My friends, acquaintances, the parents of kids on my son\u2019s soccer team that I coach \u2014 none of them know. I have a whole spiel worked out when the question comes up. I say that I\u2019m thinking of changing jobs, or I mention that I\u2019ve been spending my time organizing our house since we moved, or that I\u2019m a \u201cconsultant. \u201d Anything to avoid talking about what\u2019s really going on. I\u2019m 47 and I\u2019m unemployed. I\u2019ve been in and out of work for seven years now.",
        "In 2016, anyone who complained that movies were bad just wasn\u2019t trying. The year was full of stunners in all categories: comedies, joyous musicals, moving dramas, haunting fables, and everything in between. It was a year full of surprises from directors to veterans. Here are 21 of the best, ranked, with 10 honorable mentions at the end. 21.",
        "On Saturday, Elon Musk \u2014 the restless billionaire behind Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity \u2014 was stuck in annoying traffic and mused that one solution would be to drill more tunnels. All he\u2019d need, really, is a giant machine \u2026 Traffic is driving me nuts. Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging. .."
