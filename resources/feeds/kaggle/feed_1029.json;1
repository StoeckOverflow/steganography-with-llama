        "After nine months of boycotts and lost business deals in North Carolina, the state\u2019s lawmakers may be ready to finally quit HB2, the state\u2019s dreaded law. HB2, which the state legislature passed in March, overturned and banned local statutes that protect LGBTQ people from discrimination. It also prohibited transgender people from using bathrooms that align with their gender identity in schools and government buildings. Sarah McBride of the Human Rights Campaign called it \u201cone of the most extreme, bills we\u2019ve seen yet.",
        "When President Obama was asked at his press conference Friday about a \u201cperception\u201d that he was \u201cletting President Putin get away with interfering with the US election,\u201d he responded with a condemnation of the media\u2019s coverage of Democrats\u2019 leaked emails. Obama argued that once his administration had \u201cclarity and certainty about what in fact had happened, we publicly announced that Russia had hacked into the DNC\u201d during the campaign \u2014 making sure the public was informed of Russia\u2019s culpability before the election.",
        "On Tuesday, President Obama announced that he was putting hundreds of millions of acres of federally owned waters in the Arctic and Atlantic Ocean off limits \u201cindefinitely\u201d to future oil and gas drilling. Environmental groups had been calling for precisely this move ever since the election \u2014 as a way of preempting Donald Trump. What\u2019s interesting here is that while Obama can legally put these areas off limits by executive order, it\u2019s not at all clear that Trump can unilaterally reverse this move, at least not without Congress passing a bill.",
        "The winter solstice is upon us: Wednesday, December 21, will be the shortest day of 2016 for anyone living north of the equator (and Tuesday night was the longest night of the year). If pagan rituals are your thing, this is probably a big moment for you. If not, the official first day of winter is neat for other reasons, too. Below is a short scientific guide to the solstice and the longest night of the year (though not, as we\u2019ll see, the longest night in Earth\u2019s history \u2014 that happened back in 1912).",
        "Normally, a book about Nietzsche\u2019s political theory would not be of interest to general audiences, but against the backdrop of Brexit and Donald Trump, I suspect it will be. One reason is that Nietzsche anticipated our current cultural and political climate. From his late perch, he warned that Europe\u2019s increasingly democratic states would fall into parochialism and mass hysteria. He even condemned Otto von Bismarck, the Prussian statesman who unified Germany in 1871, for cementing his power by stoking nationalist resentments and appealing to racial purity.",
        "Many Americans woke up terrified this morning. They\u2019ll wake up afraid tomorrow, and the day after that, and every day of the newly elected Donald Trump administration. January 20 might be especially scary \u2014 but not as scary as January 21, or the day after that, or the day after that. Teachers are trying to reassure their elementary school students that they won\u2019t be deported under a President Trump \u2014 while young immigrant adults are putting off those conversations with their parents, because they don\u2019t know how to address the fact that, yes, perhaps they will be.",
        "The results of the 2016 election have led to a renewed surge of interest in the idea of regional development and the notion that policymakers ought to pay more attention to the specific dynamics of place and community and not just individuals or broad national averages.",
        "With control of the White House a month away, Republicans pledge to repeal Obamacare as one of the first acts of the next Congress. Ironically, their efforts may do more than Democrats have to entrench the Affordable Care Act. Fanciful as it sounds, the ACA\u2019s best days may lie ahead. Through seven years of withering Republican bombardment and 60 congressional votes for repeal, Obamacare seemed stuck in the limbo of popular indifference, rarely exceeding a 50 percent approval rating or dipping below 40 percent.",
        "Deaths from the synthetic opioid fentanyl more than doubled in the past year, new federal data shows. Fentanyl, an incredibly potent synthetic opioid, is thought to be anywhere from 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine and has commonly been prescribed to manage severe pain after a surgery or debilitating pain from advanced stages of cancer. But in recent years, illegal manufacturing of fentanyl has skyrocketed, and as a result, has led to a sharp spike in the number of drug overdose deaths from synthetic opioids. The new data comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
        "Israel has spent years trying to avoid getting sucked into the vicious civil war raging in neighboring Syria. It\u2019s now wading into the conflict in a way you wouldn\u2019t expect. On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he has ordered his government to \u201cfind ways\u201d to bring injured civilians from Aleppo, Syria, to Israeli hospitals. That could clear the way for hundreds of Syrians, a country still technically at war with Israel, to cross into the country at the express invitation of a prime minister normally known for his positions on Iran, the Palestinians, and other issues.",
        "Americans will spend around $655. 8 billion this holiday season, much of it on gifts for the special people in their lives. Most will be spent on items that will grow obsolete within a short time \u2014 sweaters soon to be threadbare, electronic devices soon to be replaced, kitchen tools never used. Lately, many articles have suggested an antidote: Buy experiences, not objects. And it\u2019s true \u2014 there\u2019s robust evidence that we typically find more happiness in experiences than in things. But I wouldn\u2019t write off giving material possessions entirely. Some physical gifts matter deeply.",
        "There\u2019s been a lot of noise in my Flint neighborhood this month. Men wearing big coats and gloves drive bulldozers and forklifts up and down the street, sliding orange cones back and forth, sometimes blocking off whole intersections with their trucks. They use their heavy equipment to slice through the pavement and the thick roots of our silver maples. They dig giant holes and pull out chunks of old pipe. The workers are here from early in the morning until late at night, when the flashing yellow lights on their vehicles compete with the Christmas lights and houses.",
        "The 100 American CEOs with the biggest company retirement funds have $4. 7 billion in those accounts \u2014 which is roughly equivalent to the retirement savings of the bottom 116 million Americans, or 41 percent of the country\u2019s families. This data comes from the Institute for Policy Studies, which released a new report looking at the widening gap in retirement savings between the wealthiest Americans and everyone else. It shows that CEOs have, thanks to preferential tax policies, amassed a huge amount of retirement wealth. But the story is quite different for people.",
        "National security has been the focus of virtually all of my professional life. I was in Washington on and saw the smoke rising from the Pentagon. I arrived in Iraq shortly after the 2003 US invasion and spent several years living in Baghdad and writing about what had quickly become a bloody civil war. I covered the Bush administration\u2019s decision to surge troops into Iraq in 2007 and the Obama administration\u2019s decision to surge troops into Afghanistan in 2009. I\u2019ve written about US spying efforts abroad and foreign spying efforts inside the US.",
        "Last week, the Chinese demonstrated that they have Donald Trump\u2019s number. In perhaps the first case of \u201ctrolling\u201d for an internet response, Beijing managed to accomplish two things nearly instantly: provoke an immediate Twitter response from the and demonstrate how easily Trump can get spun up over a single tiny, cheap piece of US military hardware. And it all happened over an unarmed underwater drone. Six feet long and resembling an oversize child\u2019s bathtub toy, the drone is meant to help the US Navy figure out how to use its actual submarines more efficiently, especially in shallower waters.",
        "Donald Trump gives every indication of wanting to govern like a conventional conservative Republican on the vast majority of domestic issues. One big potential exception is trade, where he campaigned in an unorthodox manner and is setting the stage for a of how federal trade policy is normally conducted. One part of that is Trump has stated his intention to make Commerce Secretary (and billionaire investor) Wilbur Ross the lead authority on trade negotiations.",
        "It\u2019s everyone\u2019s least favorite part of the Christmas season: You\u2019re expected to get a present for your but you have no idea what he wants. Or conversely, your aunt gets you a sweater that you have zero interest in ever wearing. The result: People often get a lot less value from their presents than the giver spent on them. More than 20 years ago, economist Joel Waldfogel dubbed this the \u201cdeadweight loss of Christmas. \u201d It\u2019s the gap between how much a gift giver spends on a present and how much the recipient values the gift.",
        "The white voter is a subject of excessive interest these days. Having helped swing the election in Donald Trump\u2019s favor, pundits and academics are scrambling for insights into their motivations. This is particularly true of Democrats, who learned, rather painfully, that a national election strategy has to include white voters. Justin Gest is a professor of public policy at George Mason University and the author of The New Minority: White Working Class Politics in an Age of Immigration and Inequality.",
        "If you walk around a shopping mall, turn on the radio, or go to a coffee shop between Thanksgiving and Christmas, you\u2019re going to hear Mariah Carey\u2019s \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You. \u201d It\u2019s one of the only Christmas songs written in the last 20 or so years that has reached the same popularity as the American Christmas standards that came before it. Besides those recognizable sleigh bells, what makes Mariah Carey\u2019s song sound like a classic? Adam Ragusea, a journalism professor at Mercer University, believes it\u2019s all in the chords.",
        "President Donald Trump recently picked Rep. Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina to head the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget. Like many of Trump\u2019s other Cabinet nominees, Mulvaney seems to have a disturbingly low opinion of science. In a stunning September 9 Facebook post (that\u2019s since been deleted but is still cached) Mulvaney asked, \u201c. .. what might be the best question: do we really need government funded research at all.",
        "Heading into election night, Michigan was supposed to be a cornerstone of the \u201cblue wall\u201d of states that would prevent Donald Trump from winning the presidency. Instead, the state went for Trump \u2014 and is a key reason he, not Hillary Clinton, will be the one moving into the White House next month. Freshman Democratic Sen. Gary Peters admits that he was surprised by the results in his home state, whose largest paper, the Detroit Free Press, mistakenly called the race for Clinton.",
        "Five paragraphs into the Wall Street Journal\u2019s article about how Carl Icahn, a legendary investor worth about $20 billion, will serve as a special advisor to Donald Trump on regulatory matters, things get interesting. \u201cThe position isn\u2019t an official government job,\u201d the Journal reports. \u201cMr. Icahn won\u2019t get paid and won\u2019t have to give up his current business dealings. \u201d Of course, even if Icahn did get paid, the salary would be peanuts compared with his net worth.",
        "If 2016 was good for anything, it was music. Yes, we lost a few truly brilliant minds in David Bowie, Prince, Sharon Jones, and Leonard Cohen. But on the whole, music thrived in 2016. Massive pop stars dropped albums overnight, albums that had eluded us for half a decade suddenly appeared, and captivating new names rose from nothing. To pick a top 15 songs in a year like this feels almost dismissive, cruel even.",
        "News reporters look to Twitter as their professional bloodline. It\u2019s not just where they make job connections, follow the work of their peers, and now even learn the latest from the country\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s where they make their names as young journalists. Coates thinks that\u2019s a problem. The Atlantic writer joined Ezra Klein on a recent episode of The Ezra Klein Show, where the two went deep into what\u2019s changed about our news media from the days, just a few years ago, when the blog was king.",
        "The death penalty is still legal in much of America. But increasingly, its actual use is vanishing. A new report from the Death Penalty Information Center shows the decline: In 2016, the number of executions fell to 20, a low and down from a peak of 98 in 1999. And 30 people were sentenced to death \u2014 another record low since the Supreme Court reinstated the use of the death penalty in the 1970s.",
        "Brian Marchetti has arrived at and the first thing he must do is park where nobody will see him. Over the past month, the Baltimorean has undergone a fantastic transformation. His beard, typically short and is now 7 inches long and white as snow; his business attire has been swapped for a red, suit and black boots; small reading glasses perch on the bridge of his nose.",
        "The debate about why, exactly, Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election is sure to continue for some time. But a new survey may shed some more light on exactly when she fell behind Trump: at the very end of the campaign. The new data comes from the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Institute for the Study of Citizens and Politics, which surveyed the same panel of people two weeks before the election and again about three weeks after the election. The researchers found that during that period, Trump\u2019s support among panel respondents increased by 2.",
        "For most people in society, their interactions with the police range from nonexistent to fairly neutral: that time the sheriff found you and your friends in the woods messing around and sent you home without notifying your parents. That time when the police came over and helped you get your cat out of your neighbor\u2019s tree. Or even that time when something did happen, and you called the police and they came, took notes, and left to pursue the case. Despite my best efforts, this is not my experience with the police.",
        "2016 will go down in history as a year that changed America\u2019s political landscape forever. And it gave us books that grapple with that changing landscape, fiercely and provocatively; books that delve deeply into the American identity and change the way we see it. But it also gave us books that allow us to momentarily escape from the disappointments of our world, to transcend the limitations of reality and experience life through other eyes. It may have been a trying year for nearly everything else, but 2016 was a good year for books.",
        "It took a major Ebola epidemic that led to more than 11, 000 deaths, but we now finally have a successful Ebola vaccine candidate in development. If approved, the vaccine would vastly reduce the likelihood of ever seeing another major Ebola outbreak. More than a year ago, researchers published striking preliminary results from a large trial on a vaccine called in the Lancet. They showed that everyone who got the shot immediately after contact with an Ebola victim didn\u2019t get the virus."
