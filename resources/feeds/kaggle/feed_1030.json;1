        "Vladimir Putin and the nation he leads lurked in the background of the 2016 campaign for months and months, perhaps even shaping the outcome of the race. And now Putin\u2019s preferred candidate, Donald Trump, appears ready to embrace him as an ally \u2014 a stunning shift in policy. This is a source of growing alarm among liberals. Putin is bad, they say, and so are the European parties that are aligning with him \u2014 a multicontinental alliance undergirded by Islamophobic politics that alarms respectable opinion throughout the West.",
        "2016 has been a rough year. Yet science in 2016 has remained a source of optimism. To solve a scientific problem, you have to believe it is solvable. That makes scientific discovery inherently optimistic. Discoveries help us understand our world \u2014 the scarred, imperfect beautiful mess of it \u2014 just a bit better. The biggest breakthroughs in science, which don\u2019t come around that often, also open doors for new questions to be answered. This year, we had such a breakthrough.",
        "President Donald Trump and his team like to say he runs a meritocracy, appointing only the most qualified people to the White House staff and top Cabinet positions. That is to say he hired his campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, the first female presidential campaign manager in history, because she was the best for the job. Conway, who was named counselor to the president, along with others in Trump\u2019s inner circle, maintains this message fully. Debbie Walsh, director of Rutgers University\u2019s Center for American Women and Politics, doesn\u2019t buy it. \u201cIt\u2019s a tired excuse,\u201d she said.",
        "On December 21, YouTube star Adam Saleh was asked to leave a Delta Airlines flight, allegedly because another passenger overheard him speaking Arabic while talking on the phone to his mother. Saleh\u2019s experience fits into a larger pattern of Muslims being asked to leave flights after making passengers uncomfortable. And now Saleh, who filmed part of the incident and spread it on social media, is at the center of an international debate over Islamophobia and the unfair treatment of Muslims by airlines. But the story isn\u2019t that simple.",
        "For nine years, from 2002 to 2011, a version of one of Donald Trump\u2019s most extreme proposals was standard US government policy: requiring certain people in the US on visas from countries to register with the government. President Barack Obama suspended the program in 2011 \u2014 after years of complaints by civil rights groups that the program targeted Muslims and wasn\u2019t effective in preventing terrorism. But it had never been fully dismantled \u2014 it was still sitting around for the Trump administration to dust off. Until now.",
        "At many moments of 2016, it seemed the world was falling apart. In June, there was the Orlando nightclub shooting, where dozens were killed and injured in the deadliest terror attack in the US since . That was followed by July\u2019s Bastille Day in Nice, when a terrorist drove a truck over holiday revelers, killing 84 people, including 10 children. Before the month was over, ISIS militants had assassinated a French priest in his church and executed the patrons and staff at a cafe in Dhaka, Bangladesh. And these were just a few of the terrorist attacks.",
        "On January 20, Donald Trump\u2019s new team of economic advisers will take up their posts in Washington. With them will come a new set of theories about what makes an economy grow \u2014 and a new set of political battles over questions whose answers are based more on beliefs than on real understanding. We\u2019ll hear a lot about the new administration\u2019s \u201c policies. \u201d What we won\u2019t hear is an admission that economists, and the politicians they advise, don\u2019t know much about how to make the economy grow faster for any sustained period of time.",
        "For most of my life, TV felt like a small city where you knew everybody\u2019s name. Even in the early 2000s, you might see an actor pop up on TV or a magazine cover, and even if you didn\u2019t watch their show, you\u2019d say, \u201cOh, yeah, that\u2019s the guy from that show. \u201d You didn\u2019t know everybody intimately, but you still knew who they were. That started to change in the late 2000s, and as of 2016, TV is in full urban sprawl mode.",
        "The US is in the midst of a harrowing opioid painkiller and heroin epidemic, which led to a record number of drug overdose deaths (more than 52, 000) in 2015. Unlike other drug epidemics, the current one did not start with an illicit substance. It began with legal drugs: opioid painkillers like OxyContin and Percocet, which were heavily marketed by pharmaceutical companies to sell as much of their product as possible.",
        "Lately, the internet has been overrun with headlines about how solar energy has officially become the cheapest form of electricity in the world. This is \u2026 not quite right. Solar has seen remarkable cost declines and is competing in more circumstances with every passing year. But it is not the world\u2019s cheapest source of electricity. The main reason is that there is, at least currently, no such thing as \u201cthe world\u2019s cheapest source of electricity,\u201d if that\u2019s taken to mean cheapest, all costs considered, in all places, at all times.",
        "The fight over Obamacare is heating up \u2014 and Ron Pollack will nearly certain be in the center of it. Pollack was a key advocate who fought for the passage of the Affordable Care Act. He is now organizing a coalition called Protect Our Care to fight for the health law\u2019s future. He came by the Vox office Tuesday to talk about who has gotten involved in that coalition, what role the president might play, and how much work states are able to do to save the health care law.",
        "After every big hack \u2014 like when Yahoo announced last year that 1 billion accounts were compromised \u2014 experts tell us to stop using the same password for every website. In fact, they tell us to stop memorizing our passwords altogether. Instead, they tell us to use something called a \u201dpassword manager.\u201d And that\u2019s where most of us stop reading. Because here\u2019s the thing: It\u2019s really hard to think about passwords in a different way. But it\u2019s a hugely important step in keeping your information secure.",
        "Star Wars is political now. Or rather, it\u2019s just as political as it\u2019s always been. But the question of whether you should go see the latest entry in the franchise, Rogue One, is newly politically charged. The white supremacists of the outraged by Rogue One\u2019s diverse, cast and message, have dubbed the movie \u201cracist propaganda against Whites\u201d and are tweeting \u201c#DumpStarWars\u201d to promote a Star Wars boycott. Star Wars isn\u2019t the only piece of pop culture that feels especially politically charged as 2016 comes to a close.",
        "Few fictional characters have been portrayed onscreen as often as Ebenezer Scrooge, the hero and villain of Charles Dickens\u2019s A Christmas Carol. Really, the list comes down to Scrooge, Dracula, and Sherlock Holmes, all British literary characters who\u2019ve been warped and twisted in all directions to fit whatever context a given narrative demands. IMDB lists 135 separate instances of someone playing Scrooge in one work or another \u2014 and that\u2019s to say nothing of characters who are clearly riffs on Scrooge, or cartoon characters taking a whirl at being Scrooge, or any of pop culture\u2019s other many Scrooge permutations.",
        "Passengers isn\u2019t one movie so much as three distinct movies stuck together with narrative duct tape that doesn\u2019t quite cover the seams. One of those films is pretty good; one is uneven but sometimes charming; and one is downright bad, though its badness stems from its failure to adequately address issues raised by the other two. Rating 2 Directed by Morten Tyldum (The Imitation Game) from a screenplay by Jon Spaihts (Doctor Strange, Prometheus, and the upcoming Mummy reboot) the movie stars not one but both of America\u2019s sweethearts: Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence.",
        "Donald Trump often talks about trying to keep America\u2019s adversaries scrambling to sort out his true intentions by being deliberately vague \u2014 and sometimes contradictory \u2014 in his public comments. His new call for the US to \u201cexpand its nuclear capability\u201d has done that to his own aides as well.",
        "Sh\u016bsaku End\u014d\u2019s novel Silence (first published in Japanese in 1966 as Chinmoku, then translated into English in 1969) is slippery and troubling, a book that refuses to behave. It flatters no reader; it refuses to comfort anyone. In telling the story of Portuguese priests and persecuted Christians in Japan, it navigates the tension between missionary and colonizer, East and West, Christianity and Buddhism and political ideology, but refuses to land on definitive answers.",
        "Partisanship, political scientist Brendan Nyhan likes to say, is a helluva drug. Let\u2019s look at some of its effects. At National Review, Tim Alberta has a deep dive into the House Freedom Caucus\u2019s thinking in the era of Donald Trump. You remember the Freedom Caucus \u2014 they\u2019re the conservative revolutionaries who thought John Boehner such a squish they toppled him from power. A week after the election, Rep. Ra\u00fal Labrador, a key caucus member, warned that his colleagues would go no easier on Trump than they did on Obama. They fought debt then; they will fight debt now.",
        "In the early 1900s, the biggest monopolists of the day had virtually complete control of their markets. Standard Oil. US Steel. The American Sugar Refining Company. Today we don\u2019t so much have single companies dominating an entire industry as much as a handful of extremely powerful ones. Over the past few decades, the number of markets consolidated by a few has skyrocketed, according to Columbia law professor Tim Wu.",
        "A recent survey asked, \u201cAll things considered, do you think the world is getting better or worse, or neither getting better nor worse?\u201d In Sweden, 10 percent thought things are getting better, in the US the figure was only 6 percent, and in Germany only 4 percent. Very few people think the world is getting better. What is the evidence that we need to consider when answering this question? The question is about how the world has changed, and so we must take a historical perspective.",
        "\u201cWe do not want to live paralyzed by the fear of evil. \u201d Those are the words of German Chancellor Angela Merkel before visiting the Berlin Christmas market that on Monday evening became a scene of terror when a driver plowed a large truck into a crowd of holiday shoppers, killing 12 and injuring 48. The suspected perpetrator, a Tunisian national named Anis Amri, is still on the loose and his specific motives remain unknown, though ISIS has claimed responsibility.",
        "lists can be overwhelming. Every December, like clockwork, you look around and realize just how many great albums, books, or films you\u2019ve missed from the preceding year. (Don\u2019t feel bad \u2014 there\u2019s a lot out there to pay attention to; it\u2019s okay to have skipped a few.) If you\u2019re still doing your best to catch up on all the excellent music 2016 delivered, we\u2019re providing a cheat sheet in the form of a \u201cyou may also like\u201d list. Below are 11 very popular 2016 albums and songs, paired with slightly (but highly recommended) analogues from this year.",
        "2016 has been a shitty year \u2014 a heartbreaking, barely bearable year. You\u2019ve made it this far, and now it might be tempting, as you search for the perfect holiday film with which to round out the year, to kick back and let Bruce Willis carry you, barefoot, over crunching glass, amid the wailing of a bunch of hapless \u201980s yuppies, into 2017.",
        "Washington, DC, passed one of the nation\u2019s most generous paid family leave laws on Tuesday, joining four other states with programs in place or in the works that make sure all workers can take paid time off to care for their families. It will give eight weeks of paid leave to new parents, and six weeks of leave for other family caregiving, to more than half a million private sector and nonprofit workers.",
        "Ever since the contested 2000 presidential election, the way that American elections are run has become increasingly partisan and contentious. The 2016 elections ratcheted up the number of complaints by all parties, yet there is heated disagreement about the nature of the problem \u2014 let alone potential solutions. For many years, the main complaint by the GOP has centered on alleged incidents of illegal fraud, in which it is claimed that ineligible people registered and cast ballots \u2014 for example, citizens and felons, or simply imposters voting more than once.",
        "Every December, TV and radio become an aural hellscape, characterized by inescapable and obnoxiously tinny renditions of classic holiday music. If you want to give your eardrums a break but would still enjoy some festive winter tunes, this cover of the original 1857 \u201cJingle Bells\u201d is a solid choice. When James Lord Pierpont wrote \u201dThe One Horse Open Sleigh\u201d in 1857, the song was subtly different from the \u201cJingle Bells\u201d we know in 2016. The difference in the lyrics is pretty minor.",
        "Shortly before leaving for Christmas break, some members of Donald Trump\u2019s transition team floated the idea of a 10 percent tariff \u2014 a tax on imported goods \u2014 as a means of fulfilling Trump\u2019s campaign pledges to boost American manufacturing and protect American workers from foreign competition. The United States first introduced a protective tariff of this kind in George Washington\u2019s administration (this is in part what \u201cCabinet Battle #1\u201d from Hamilton is about) and fights over the use of tariffs as a tool of economic policy were a staple of American politics until about World War I.",
        "It is no longer enough to label a film a Christmas movie. The sheer volume of entries in the genre demands a more specific taxonomy: There are the comedies (Santa Clause, Jingle All the Way) canonized classics (Miracle on 34th Street and It\u2019s a Wonderful Life) Yuletide horror (Black Christmas or the more recent Krampus) and in the vein of Love Actually. Hell, A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas even brought the genre into the fold.",
        "President Barack Obama has decided to go out with a bang: In a stunning diplomatic rebuke of Israel, the United States on Friday abstained on a controversial United Nations Security Council resolution demanding an end to Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory, allowing it to pass easily. By abstaining \u2014 instead of vetoing the resolution, as the United States has reliably done to similar measures for decades \u2014 the Obama administration allowed the highly symbolic measure to make it through the chamber.",
        "Rating 2. 5 When does it become appropriate to relive a traumatic experience? Or to put it another way: How soon is too soon? That\u2019s the question that lingers when thinking about Patriots Day, the second movie from director Peter Berg this year. The first was Deepwater Horizon, a competent and stirring film that unpacked the 2010 BP oil rig disaster and served as a warning about the human toll of unfettered corporate greed. Deepwater Horizon also positioned the rig workers as everyday heroes, which is Berg\u2019s main subject of late, beginning with Lone Survivor (2013)."
