        "Like clockwork, the articles and TV segments on how to stick to a diet, how to avoid overeating, and how to \u201ddetox\u201d after you\u2019ve overindulged have arrived. Tips include replacing potatoes with cauliflower, filling up on salad instead of stuffing, and doing everything you can to tune out the siren call of sugary Christmas cookies. I say: Ignore this miserable advice. Just eat the damn cookies this Christmas. Here\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with obsessing about an extra cookie or slice of cake this week: It\u2019s a distraction from what really matters for health.",
        "\u2019Twas the night before Christmas, and I really, really wanted a freakin\u2019 drink. During Christmas dinners past, between courses, you could always find me ducking into my room to hide. I felt incredibly uncomfortable at the table, but I never drank in front of my family \u2014 my parents knew I had a problem. I usually held tight and counted the minutes before I could escape and meet up with my friends for a drink (or four). As loving as my family is, they have their moments \u2014 and the holidays seem to bring a lot more of them.",
        "It\u2019s late December, which means it\u2019s time for TV networks to haul out holiday standards. But what if you\u2019re not in the mood for the kinds of holiday cheer whipped up by A Christmas Story or It\u2019s a Wonderful Life? What if you want to celebrate the season with something a little less filled with cheer, something set during the season but not really of the season? Well, have you considered something ?",
        "It\u2019s hard to imagine a more perfect film for the holiday season than Hidden Figures: an inspirational, historical drama about three black women whose work at NASA was instrumental in putting John Glenn into orbit around Earth. That could have been the recipe for a much hokier film, but the story \u2014 based on a book by Margot Lee Shetterly \u2014 is just Hollywood enough to stay entertaining, but smart enough to know how important its story is. Director Theodore Melfi (St. Vincent) sticks to every convention of the genre, but sometimes conventions are there for a reason.",
        "As a standalone Christmas special, the new Sense8 event, straightforwardly titled \u201cSense8: A Christmas Special\u201d and debuting on Netflix Friday, December 23, leaves something to be desired. Rating 4 Technically, it\u2019s more of a premiere for the series\u2019 upcoming second season (dropping in May 2017). It picks up in the wake of the season one finale, as the characters \u2014 now aware that they\u2019re all mentally linked, despite being scattered around the globe \u2014 start to make sense of their new lives.",
        "December 25, 2016 To Whom It May Concern: Sitting at my desk in the winter of \u201917, I have no way of knowing what the future holds for the United States under the administration of Donald Trump. I hope it will all turn out for the best. But I fear that it will not. The election of a man temperamentally unfit for the presidency and lacking in the basic qualifications to perform the job, backed up by congressional allies who seem determined to ignore his flagrant corruption, is an alarming situation.",
        "Singer and pop icon George Michael has died at his home in the UK at the age of 53. Police said they are currently treating the cause of death as unexplained, but there were no suspicious circumstances in Michael\u2019s death, according to the BBC. Michael performed some of the biggest pop hits of the \u201980s Michael, born in London in 1963 as Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou, first rose to acclaim as part of the duo Wham!. He began performing with Andrew Ridgeley under that name in 1981 at the age of 18.",
        "It might seem unbelievable given that the radio has been blasting Christmas tunes since Thanksgiving, but the true Christmas season actually starts on Christmas Day itself. That\u2019s right: December 25 marks the official start of the 12 days of Christmas, the Christian tradition that shares its name with a relentlessly Christmas carol. Here are a few things you may not have known about the song and the season. What are the 12 days of Christmas?",
        "If you ask an average American what policies from the Donald Trump administration they\u2019re paying attention to, or care about, chances are they\u2019ll answer with something like \u201cbuilding the wall\u201d or \u201cbanning Muslim immigrants\u201d or \u201crepealing Obamacare\u201d or \u201ccozying up to Russia. \u201d If you ask corporate lobbyists, though, odds are pretty good that one of the first things they\u2019ll mention is border adjustment.",
        "Every weekend, we pick a movie you can stream that dovetails with current events. Old, new, blockbuster, arthouse: They\u2019re all fair game. What you can count on is a weekend watch that sheds new light on the week that was. The movie of the week for December 18 through 24 is A Christmas Tale (2008) which is available to stream on Hulu or digitally rent on Amazon and iTunes.",
        "Originally published on Ensia. Frank Morton has been breeding lettuce since the 1980s. His company offers 114 varieties, among them Outredgeous, which last year became the first plant that NASA astronauts grew and ate in space. For nearly 20 years, Morton\u2019s work was limited only by his imagination and by how many different kinds of lettuce he could get his hands on. But in the early 2000s, he started noticing more and more lettuces were patented, meaning he would not be able to use them for breeding.",
        "In the second season premiere of 30 Rock, Liz Lemon returns from hiatus to discover that her boss, Jack Donaghy, has created something called \u201cSeinfeldVision\u201d for the TV network. \u201cWell, l realized that NBC owns hundreds of hours of footage of Seinfeld from his massively successful television series, Seinfeld,\u201d Jack tells Liz. \u201cSo my old tech guys were able to digitally capture Seinfeld, and now we can basically make him do or say whatever we want. So for the month of October, all of our primetime shows will feature a computerized guest appearance from Mr.",
        "This piece, originally published on Grist, is the third in a series on how to tackle poverty while protecting the environment. Read the intro. The women collected dead butterflies and attached their wings to silhouettes of animals; then, at least in theory, they\u2019d sell them. That was the plan for improving life and protecting the landscape around the Mexican village of Tres Reyes. The nonprofit U Yool Che\u0301 hatched this plan in hopes of providing an environmentally friendly alternative to hunting and clearing land for cornfields.",
        "It\u2019s been oft remarked that if you had pitched the 2016 election as a novel, publishers would\u2019ve rejected it as crudely drawn, and unrealistic. Which is perhaps why the single best rendering of the campaign came in the form of a comic book. On page 13 of Vote Loki, Marvel\u2019s imagining of its trickster god antihero\u2019s campaign for president (and obvious commentary on the 2016 campaign) Loki stops a terrorist attack aimed at the two bland major party candidates vying for the presidency. All cameras, naturally, turn toward him.",
        "Bernie Sanders has identified the cancer he thinks is coursing through the Democratic Party\u2019s bloodstream. In speech after speech, the Vermont senator has gone after the party\u2019s donor class \u2014 and its hold on politicians \u2014 as the central impediment to both a more populist Democratic Party and its electoral success. \u201cI believe strongly that the party must break loose from its corporate establishment ties,\u201d Sanders said in a New York Times shortly after the election.",
        "Christmas has come and gone, but in some countries the celebration is far from over. Yes, gentle readers, December 26 is Boxing Day, which for Americans is the day we recover from our eggnog and hangovers but for other parts of the world is a holiday in its own right. What is Boxing Day? Boxing Day, which always falls on December 26, is observed as an official public holiday in the UK and many European countries, as well as in former British colonies such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa (among others).",
        "Every year, the songs that become staples on the American Top 40 charts have a tone. In 2008, that tone was pure optimism, with songs like Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cI Kissed a Girl\u201d and Colbie Caillat\u2019s \u201cBubbly. \u201d In 2015, the songs were and kind of frantic: songs like Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cBlank Space,\u201d and Hozier\u2019s \u201cTake Me to Church. \u201d This year, the songs are even more similar: They all sound like songs for dancing and crying, songs whose uncertainty could go on for a minute or for 40.",
        "Every Sunday, we pick a new episode of the week. It could be good. It could be bad. It will always be interesting. You can read the archives here. The episode of the week for the last two weeks of 2016, December 18 through 31, 2016, is \u201cThe Return of Doctor Mysterio\u201d the 2016 Christmas special of BBC America\u2019s Doctor Who. Whom are we supposed to sympathize with on Doctor Who? Which character is meant to have our allegiance? This is a bit of a trick question, because the answer changes from episode to episode.",
        "Inner Circle Vice President Mike Pence back to top The vice presidency is a strange office, lacking practically any formal powers despite its symbolic importance and high public profile. The result is that a vice president\u2019s influence depends largely on the whims of the president. Some veeps have been delegated important tasks and served as major strategic advisers, while others have been largely ignored and sent off to attend funerals that aren\u2019t deemed worth the president\u2019s time. Trump chose Indiana Gov.",
        "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the Obama administration secretly \u201ccolluded\u201d with Jerusalem\u2019s adversaries on a United Nations Security Council resolution criticizing Israeli settlements. For good measure, Netanyahu has also likened Obama to former US President Jimmy Carter, whom he pointedly derided as \u201chostile\u201d to Israel. The Obama administration denies any such collusion, saying that the resolution merely \u201creflects the facts on the ground\u201d and that\u2019s why it did not veto it. With the two governments continuing to trade blows, the fight over the resolution has gotten ugly fast.",
        "Carrie Fisher, best known for originating the role of Leia in the Star Wars films but also a tremendous writer and character actress, has died after suffering a massive heart attack while on a flight from London to Los Angeles on December 23. She was 60. A statement released to People magazine on behalf of Fisher\u2019s daughter, Billie Lourd, confirmed Fisher\u2019s death this morning: \u201cIt is with a very deep sadness that Billie Lourd confirms that her beloved mother Carrie Fisher passed away at 8:55 this morning,\u201d reads the statement.",
        "About six months ago, President Obama became the first sitting American president to visit Hiroshima, the site of one of the nuclear strikes that devastated Japan during World War II and accelerated its complete surrender to the US and its allies. In a bid to reciprocate the gesture, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is visiting Pearl Harbor on Tuesday, an act Tokyo has painted as a historic and unprecedented move. It turns out that it\u2019s happened before \u2014 and that least three other Japanese leaders made the trip before Abe did.",
        "In 2016, a year that\u2019s been marked with more than its fair share of tragedy and deaths, things in America have been especially grim when it comes to dealing with racism. Central to that is Donald Trump\u2019s election win despite (or because of, depending on your analysis) his unabashedly racist remarks and promises during his campaign to sanction discrimination.",
        "If you\u2019re under 35, odds are you were upset by the results of the 2016 presidential election. That\u2019s not because young voters had any particular love for Hillary Clinton \u2014 she did slightly worse with them than Barack Obama did in 2008 and 2012 \u2014 but because millennials\u2019 dislike of Donald Trump has been off the charts. The situation is reversed when it comes to older voters. Voters over age 45 broke for Trump over Clinton by about 9 percentage points.",
        "Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, just vetoed a bill, passed by the Ohio legislature earlier this month, that would have made the state\u2019s renewable energy portfolio (RPS) standards voluntary for two years. This means the standards will now go back into effect in January, after a suspension that began in 2014. The bill was driven by legislators involved in the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) a conservative group that has been waging (mostly unsuccessful) war on state energy standards across the country. ALEC\u2019s champion in the legislature, Cincinnati Republican Rep.",
        "Andrew Reynolds\u2019s political science research doesn\u2019t principally focus on the US; his specialty is democratization in countries emerging from dictatorship, often countries with weak state institutions. His CV lists articles with titles like \u201cParties and Accountable Government in New Democracies,\u201d and \u201cThe Impact of Election Administration on the Legitimacy of Emerging Democracies. \u201d His faculty page at the University of North Carolina notes he\u2019s consulted on election and constitutional design in countries like Afghanistan, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Kenya, South Africa, Sudan, Syria, and Zimbabwe.",
        "Carrie Fisher has died at the age of 60. No doubt Fisher\u2019s biggest role, and what she\u2019ll be remembered for, is embodying the hope and fire of Star Wars\u2019 Princess Leia. But that character is just one of many reasons why so many people love Fisher. Off camera, Fisher was brassy, salty, and incredibly funny. She wasn\u2019t afraid to say things that would make you wince and laugh \u2014 she once told Stephen Colbert that even in galaxies far, far away, women are subject to double standards. And she was nimble and quick with her wit.",
        "Donald Trump won the White House promising to bring back manufacturing jobs. Now that he\u2019s going to actually be president, he has to figure out how to make good on that promise. He would like to accomplish this through a series of announcements, like last month\u2019s deal to keep 800 Carrier jobs in the United States \u2014 or perhaps by renegotiating trade deals to give US workers a leg up over their foreign competitors. But the reality is that there\u2019s unlikely to be a quick fix for America\u2019s declining manufacturing sector.",
        "A dozen years ago, it was common for film fans to wake up on Christmas morning and find a trove of DVDs under the tree. DVDs, and later were the gifts from people who love movies to people who love movies.",
        "Carrie Fisher spent a lifetime fighting people\u2019s expectations and found a new hope in not giving a shit what you, I, or anyone else thought of her \u2014 which is exactly why I\u2019ve always thought the world of her. My introduction to Fisher was the same as most people\u2019s: staring up at a screen in admiration and wonder as her steely Princess Leia took Star Wars by storm and sheer force of will. She was a thrown into the twin chaoses of deep space and Hollywood, and she proved a shining star in both."
