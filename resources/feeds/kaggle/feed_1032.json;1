        "It\u2019s probably fair to say that liberal political writers don\u2019t spend a lot of time thinking about the details of retired coal miners\u2019 pensions. But in the issue became a flashpoint when Markos Moulitsas, the editor and founder of Daily Kos, told his readers not to care what happened to 120, 000 coal miners in Appalachia whose pensions and health care are about to expire without federal help. \u201cBe happy for coal miners losing their health insurance. They\u2019re getting exactly what they voted for,\u201d his headline blared.",
        "In 1923, a motley collection of philosophers, cultural critics, and sociologists formed the Institute of Social Research in Frankfurt, Germany. Known popularly as the Frankfurt School, it was an crew of lefty theorists, including Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno, Erich Fromm, Max Horkheimer, and Herbert Marcuse. The Frankfurt School consisted mostly of who hoped for a socialist revolution in Germany but instead got fascism in the form of the Nazi Party. Addled by their misreading of history and their failure to foresee Hitler\u2019s rise, they developed a form of social critique known as critical theory.",
        "Many will rejoice as this challenging year comes to a close, but the events that took place in 2016 will have consequences that reverberate far into 2017 and beyond. It was a year with political turmoil and terrorism dominating headlines across the globe. In the US, a bitter election revealed the country\u2019s widening cultural divide. And we lost luminaries like Carrie Fisher and Muhammad Ali, who reminded us not to accept the world as it is, but to be the change we wish to see.",
        "Debbie Reynolds, one of Hollywood\u2019s most reliable entertainers for well over 60 years, has died after suffering a suspected stroke at 84 years old. Reynolds\u2019s son Todd confirmed the news to Variety, saying, \u201cShe wanted to be with Carrie. \u201d The news comes as a particular shock this week, as Carrie Fisher \u2014 Reynolds\u2019s daughter with singer Eddie Fisher \u2014 died on the 27th, just over 24 hours before her mother. Reynolds first her way into movie audiences\u2019 hearts as the star of Singin\u2019 in the Rain.",
        "US Secretary of State John Kerry used a speech Wednesday to deliver what was perhaps the clearest, most detailed attack on Israeli settlements ever articulated by a senior US official. The nearly speech was striking in both its level of detail and its subtle yet unmistakable policy shifts.",
        "Carrie Fisher, who died December 27 at the age of 60, was best known for her iconic, kickass performance as Star Wars\u2019 Princess Leia. But Fisher also had an equally kickass, incredibly successful career as a writer, script doctor, and mental health advocate, not to mention as a fantastic performer in works that weren\u2019t related to the film franchise that made her (most) famous. I was lucky enough to see Fisher\u2019s show, Wishful Drinking, at the Arena Stage in Washington, DC, in 2008.",
        "Albert Einstein was one of the most important physicists of all time. His scientific predictions have withstood 100 years of scientific challenges. His thinking fundamentally changed the way we understand the universe. Yet people are more likely to be convinced Einstein wasn\u2019t a great physicist than to change their minds on topics like immigration or the death penalty. It has nothing to do with a person\u2019s intelligence (or the quality of information on Einstein or immigration policy). It\u2019s due to the fact that we\u2019re simply more open to changing our minds on nonpolitical topics.",
        "Years from now, when we look back at 2016, what will we remember it for? Every year has its fair share of upheaval, but 2016 seemed to bring more than most. The Western political sphere was rocked to its core by Brexit and Donald Trump becoming America\u2019s . An Orlando gay club was the site of the most devastating mass shooting in modern American history. A worldwide refugee crisis kept getting worse as Aleppo burned. Still, the machine that is pop culture continued to chug along as it always has.",
        "My first job as a preschool teacher was at a local day care where I live in San Diego, California, that also ran a small preschool class. The school was one large, chaotic room with one smaller room for the \u201cpreschool\u201d cordoned off by large, plastic blocks. I taught for the first time in that tiny room, surrounded by the screaming, happy kids of the facility. Surely my kids didn\u2019t learn anything in that din, but I loved them, and they were well cared for.",
        "The Echo, Amazon\u2019s speaker, was a big hit this holiday season. Amazon is keeping specific sales figures under wraps, but the company says it sold nine times as many Echo devices during the holidays as it did a year earlier. It\u2019s the latest example of Amazon pioneering a new product category and then going on to dominate it. Amazon has become the leader in the market on the strength of its Kindle line of . And it dominates an important segment of the cloud computing market; Amazon Web Services is expected to generate $12 billion in revenue this year.",
        "In the weeks following Trump\u2019s election, as elites tried to make sense of what went so horribly wrong (as they saw it) many an accusing eye turned its gaze toward Facebook. There were criticisms of the social network site \u2014 notably that it places us into feeding us stories that reinforce our political views. But a new scourge also emerged: Facebook, according to reports from BuzzFeed and other sources, had become a breeding ground for misinformation and purposeful disinformation. The rise of fake news on Facebook is worrisome, to be sure.",
        "Conservative climate denialists are a source of immense frustration to scientists and liberals \u2014 and have been for decades. As long as I\u2019ve been writing, there\u2019s been a perpetual quest to find just the right argument to appeal to conservatives and pierce their denial. This has led to periodic flurries of headlines in the climate journosphere around various social science studies that purport to finally crack the nut, to find the argument that works.",
        "General Tso\u2019s chicken is freaking delicious. And thankfully, it\u2019s enormously popular in America\u2019s Chinese restaurants, making it easy to purchase and even get delivered to your door at 1 am on a Saturday. But you might be surprised to learn that General Tso\u2019s chicken is actually not very big in China \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t even originate from mainland China. In fact, it hasn\u2019t even been around for long: Its creation is widely credited to Peng (who recently died) in 1952.",
        "Game of Thrones\u2019 most recent season found repellant villain Ramsay Bolton bloodied and strapped to a chair. He\u2019d come within a breath of securing his grasp on the North in the season\u2019s epic battle. Instead, thanks to a strategic decision made by Sansa Stark, who had briefly been his unwilling wife, he found himself unexpectedly defeated. Sansa chose his punishment \u2014 feeding him to his own ravenous hounds. She watched as the dogs attacked the man who brutally raped and tortured her during their brief marriage. As she turned away, the faintest of smiles played across her lips.",
        "We\u2019ve somehow made it to the end of 2016 without spontaneously bursting into flame (at least literally speaking). Here at Vox Culture we\u2019ve spent the past several days discussing the year\u2019s best TV shows, TV episodes, movies, novels, new comic books, older comic books, performances, underrated albums, and more \u2014 and now we\u2019re summing up 2016 another way, with five words that shed light on this chaotic, confusing, year. Deplorables At a September 9 fundraiser, Hillary Clinton coined a phrase to describe a portion of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters: \u201cbasket of deplorables.",
        "2016 was a strange year for Hollywood on the box office front. As expected, Walt Disney Studios dominated and Warner Bros. made a comeback, but there were few breakout surprises, let alone new franchises to truly embrace, outside of Deadpool and Bad Moms. (No, true believers, Doctor Strange doesn\u2019t count. Everyone knew it was going to be a hit.) And while movies that were expected to bomb, such as Warcraft and The Legend of Tarzan, did exactly that, they also sort of didn\u2019t, thanks to the wonders of studio accounting and international sales.",
        "What are America\u2019s strategic objectives in the Middle East? How consistently have they been defined and pursued over the past three decades? What are the metrics of success? Are we better off today than we were 15 or 20 years ago? For Andrew Bacevich, a retired Army colonel and a professor of international relations at Boston University, the answers to these questions are muddled at best, depressing at worst.",
        "The Islamic State starts the new year with a drastically depleted bank account, counterterrorism officials say, following months of intensified efforts to deprive the Islamists of oil profits and other revenue used to finance military operations and terrorist attacks abroad. Coalition aircraft in the past 15 months have destroyed more than 1, 200 tanker trucks \u2014 including 168 vehicles struck in a single air raid in Syria in early December \u2014 while also using new weapons and tactics to inflict lasting damage on the terrorists\u2019 remaining oil fields, U. S. and Middle Eastern officials say.",
        "MOSCOW \u201d In a New Year s address that came off like a victory lap, Russian President Vladimir Putin thanked his country Saturday in the wake of a wildly successful 2016 that saw the Kremlin leader shore up Russia s standing abroad and acquire a host of powerful geopolitical friends. Putin heads into 2017 on a strong note, having brokered a in Syria that sidelined the United States and having won the praise of \u00c2 Donald Trump by declining to retaliate in response to the Obama administration s decision to punish Moscow over its alleged interference in the U.",
        "For much of this year, Donald Trump and Vladi mir Putin have been engaged in a courtship. They have said kind things about each other in public and separately expressed visions of a mutually agreeable future. Since Trump\u2019s election, the anticipation has become more explicit. It culminated this week in the U. S. \u2019s call for America to \u201cmove on\u201d from allegations of Russian electoral hacking, and the Russian president\u2019s blithe pronouncement Friday that he would rather plan for a new relationship with Trump than retaliate in kind to sanctions and expulsions ordered by outgoing President Obama.",
        "A code associated with the Russian hacking operation dubbed Grizzly Steppe by the Obama administration has been detected within the system of a Vermont utility, according to U. S. officials. While the Russians did not actively use the code to disrupt operations, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a security matter, the discovery underscores the vulnerabilities of the nation\u2019s electrical grid. And it raises fears in the U. S. government that Russian government hackers are actively trying to penetrate the grid to carry out potential attacks.",
        "Americans view the election of a president the same way the world once looked upon the coronation of a British monarch. The king or queen who carried the crown was believed to embody the character of the empire he or she ruled. Just as the Victorian Age represented British supremacy and personal refinement, most opinion leaders I know convinced themselves that the election of Barack Obama signaled the triumph of multiculturalism over tribalism, multilateralism over American exceptionalism and cool rationalism over fundamentalism. They were wrong. Less than two years after Obama\u2019s inauguration, the tea party was swept into power.",
        "Looking back at 2016, it\u2019s remarkable how often the year was invoked as an argument against its own events. Take just a few examples. A CNN article implored: \u201cIt\u2019s 2016. What\u2019s with all the sexism?\u201d A Los Angeles Times reminded readers, \u201cIt\u2019s 2016 and the civil rights era hasn\u2019t ended. \u201d A post at Grist marveled, \u201cIt\u2019s 2016, and we\u2019re arguing about the constitutional validity of Roe v. Wade. \u201d And Ellen DeGeneres scolded Georgia for its \u201creligious liberty\u201d bill with the tweet: \u201cIt\u2019s 2016 and we\u2019re still talking about equal rights for everyone.",
        "David Priess, a former analyst and daily intelligence briefer at the CIA, is the author of The President s Book of Secrets: The Untold Story of Intelligence Briefings to America s Presidents From Kennedy to Obama. ? We ve learned that Donald Trump has declined many intelligence briefings, delegating the daily task instead to Vice Mike Pence. I get it when I need it, ? Trump said. I m, like, a smart person. I don t need to be told the same thing and the same words every single day for the next eight years. ?",
        "Could there be a Pact in our future? Could President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, united in their mutual admiration despite ideological differences, enter into a straightforward nonaggression agreement, in which the United States and Russia pledge \u201cto desist from any act of violence, any aggressive action and any attack on each other, either individually or jointly with other powers\u201d? Trump has declared his desire: \u201cI want to get along with Russia.",
        "There\u2019s only one thing certain about 2017 as the year begins: It will be one day shorter than 2016. But in honor of New Year\u2019s Day, we asked Washington Post staffers to look ahead to the themes, ideas and arguments that will dominate the next 12 months in the worlds they cover. From D. C.",
        "Walter Isaacson, the CEO of the Aspen Institute, is the author of \u201cThe Innovators\u201d and biographies of Henry Kissinger, Benjamin Franklin, Albert Einstein and Steve Jobs. Let me confess that my natural inclination, when asked to write an essay on Michael Lewis, was to dredge up some of the tales of his misbehavior as a kid and reveal what a miscreant he actually is. Lewis and I went to the same school when we were growing up in New Orleans.",
        "SANTA MONICA, Calif. \u2014 Here in the land of beauty and it\u2019s important to keep up appearances. Tracy Quinn sees it whenever she walks her dog: sprinklers irrigating pretty green lawns and wasted water bleeding across sidewalks during the state\u2019s driest spell in centuries. \u201cIt drives me crazy,\u201d said Quinn, a water policy analyst for the Natural Resources Defense Council. But now California is preparing for a dramatic change in how its residents use water. A water management plan that could be finalized in January is designed to make conservation \u201ca way of life.",
        "The screaming voices of children can be heard on the 911 call. No one is talking to the dispatcher. All that can be heard are screams of \u201cStop!\u201d in the background. \u201cPlease stop! Just stop, Daddy. Just stop. \u201d The call was made Monday night from the home of South Carolina state Rep. Chris Corley, a young politician who made headlines last year when he staunchly fought to keep the Confederate flag flying on the statehouse grounds. The screaming voices appear to have come from his children.",
        "The federal courts in general and the Supreme Court in particular have been a focal point of the contentious 2016 election campaign, but Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. continued to steer well clear of controversy in his report issued Saturday. Roberts did not mention that the court has been shorthanded since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February nor the Senate\u2019s refusal to hold a hearing for President Obama\u2019s nominee to the court, U. S. Circuit Court Judge Merrick Garland."
