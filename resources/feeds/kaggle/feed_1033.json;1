        "As the Christmas season kicks into high gear and we\u2019re surrounded by gorgeously decorated fir trees and songs of yuletide gay, it\u2019s easy to forget that the holidays represent a grim time in terms of health statistics. You\u2019re more likely to die of natural causes from Dec. 25 through New Year\u2019s Day than at any other time of the year. This spike, identified by sociologist David P. Phillips while combing through death certificates in the United States, has been confirmed in subsequent studies using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other large data sets.",
        "Jackson Leyden had always been a healthy kid; he practiced taekwondo, and he played lacrosse and baseball. But in 2011, a few months after his eighth birthday, he began having seizures several times a day. Many were brief, a of staring into space, but he also had severe episodes in which he would collapse, sometimes injuring himself. Over the next two years, he was hospitalized about 50 times, and he missed much of fourth and fifth grade. His parents took him to more than 20 doctors around the country, and he tried more than a dozen medications. Nothing worked.",
        "Two fighters took to the cage for the UFC 207 main event, two more for the event on Friday night in Las Vegas. Of the four, three performed like champions. The other was Ronda Rousey. This night rightfully belonged to Amanda Nunes, who defended her women\u2019s bantamweight championship for the first time with a ferocious technical knockout of the ghost of the Rousey we used to know.",
        "PHOENIX \u2014 So, can these high, mighty, College Football Playoff semifinals on Saturday live up to that supposedly lukewarm Florida Orange Bowl of Friday night? They probably cannot.",
        "Interviews by Amanda McGrath Journalist Katherine Foley, 24, says she\u2019s direct, disarming and looking for someone genuine who\u2019ll challenge her. Management consultant Gerard Horan, 25, says he\u2019s amusing and reliable and wants someone who doesn\u2019t play games. We sent them to Exiles Bar on U Street to see if they\u2019d get right to the point. Gerard: Most people our age have the whole \u201cdating game\u201d [mentality] of trying to sell yourself or be strategic. [But] we both went into it thinking, Okay, just be yourself. Katherine: It was uncomfortable at first.",
        "You don\u2019t really need to make it an official resolution, do you? That in 2017 you will travel \u2014 a lot? But maybe you will resolve to be smarter about booking airfare and snagging those low prices. Here are some developments that could help make that promise stick. More \u2018 \u2019 fares Next year, George Hobica, founder of AirfareWatchdog. com, predicts that more airlines will start offering budget fares.

        "Whether you make formal New Year\u2019s resolutions or not, the changing of the calendar often leads to contemplating what changes we might like to see in our lives. On the nutrition front, these are my top five picks for habits worth cultivating in 2017. Cook more Creating and serving even the simplest of meals is a profound way of caring for yourself and your loved ones. Homemade meals tend to be more healthful than ones you purchase, because when you cook from scratch, you know exactly what you\u2019re eating.",
        "1930. (Associated Press) \u201cAuld Lang Syne. \u201d New calendars. Champagne. Fireworks. The ball drop. The Times Square ball drop on New Year\u2019s Eve has become synonymous with the holiday itself. Since 1907, there have been only two Januaries \u2014 1942 and 1943 \u2014 that did not begin with the iconic ball\u2019s descent at One Times Square. In those years, people still gathered in Times Square, but a moment of silence for the troops fighting in World War II welcomed the new year instead of the typical cheers.",

        "ISTANBUL \u2014 Leanne Nasser was a teenager, in Istanbul with friends for the New Year, despite her father\u2019s concerns about safety. Fatih Cakmak, who survived a bomb attack only weeks ago, was hired to work security for a popular nightclub. Both were among those who died early Sunday when a gunman, brandishing an assault rifle, stormed Istanbul\u2019s famed Reina Club on the banks of the Bosphorus, gunning down unsuspecting New Year\u2019s revelers in a rampage that was one of the city\u2019s worst mass killings in recent memory.",
        "In 2004, the last time that Democrats comprehensively lost a national election, an argument broke out about how the party should reform. John F. Kerry had been just one state \u2014 Ohio \u2014 away from victory. Democrats had lost Senate seats in red states, but held their own in the House and in state legislatures. (Republicans netted three seats, but would have lost a net of two seats but for gerrymandering in Texas.) Hillary Clinton loomed as the favorite for the party\u2019s 2008 presidential nomination, but it was clear to many pundits that the party needed someone else.",
        "Reince Priebus says that one of his most important tasks as Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff will be to establish \u201csome level of order within the White House. \u201d That, of course, has been the central mission of everyone who has held this post in the past, but it is certain to be a particularly daunting challenge with a president who regards chaos as a management tool. Trump\u2019s Twitter feed is a daily, sometimes hourly, testament to his impulsive nature, his disregard for norms and protocol, his bottomless appetite for random information and misinformation.",
        "FAYETTEVILLE, N. C. \u2014 They hadn\u2019t seen each other since the day one attacked the other, and now it was nine months later, and they were approaching a county courthouse to face each other for the second time in their lives. First came John Franklin McGraw, 79, who goes by \u201cQuick Draw McGraw\u201d and spends his days in a cowboy hat and leather boots with heels because, he says, \u201ca cowboy can\u2019t be . \u201d Then came Rakeem Lamar Jones, 27, a man in skinny jeans who has long dreadlocks and tattoos up and down his arms.",
        "The young woman sat on a city bench in Athens, Ohio, smoking a Marlboro. She told me her name is Keri, she\u2019s 29, and she has a daughter and a history of drug addiction and mood disorders. She\u2019d just been to a court hearing to get custody of her child. Bad as things are for her, they used to be worse, she said. \u201cI\u2019d want 10 Percocets to get through the day,\u201d she said.",
        "In the future, Americans \u2014 assuming there are any left \u2014 will look back at 2016 and remark: \u201cWhat the HELL?\u201d They will have a point. Over the past few decades, we here at the Year in Review have reviewed some pretty disturbing years. For example, there was 2000, when the outcome of a presidential election was decided by a tiny group of deeply confused Florida residents who had apparently attempted to vote by chewing on their ballots.",
        "Dan Nicholson tried to do the thing. In 2007, armed with a physics degree from Purdue, he secured a job as a laser engineer. He had a salary and health insurance, plus he was using his degree, which is more than almost every English major can say. But every day he was going through the motions; checking off boxes; adhering to strict protocols. \u201cAnd I was just thinking: If I do this for 20 years, I will be able to talk to . 01 percent of the population about this useless thing I\u2019m doing,\u201d he said.",
        "Before the ball dropped and 2016 finally came to an end, revelers in Times Square and viewers watching at home were treated to an incredibly awkward five minutes of Mariah Carey. The pop diva had just finished singing \u201cAuld Lang Syne\u201d as part of \u201cDick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve with Ryan Seacrest. \u201d Then the track of her 1991 hit \u201cEmotions\u201d began. \u201cGot me feeling,\u201d Carey attempted, before stopping and telling her backup dancers to \u201cjust walk me down\u201d the stairs. \u201cWe can\u2019t hear,\u201d she said.",
        "Media reports that D. C. area private schools have brushed off Kellyanne Conway, the woman who ran Donald Trump\u2019s successful presidential campaign and who will serve as counselor to the president, are, it turns out, greatly exaggerated. A piece in the New York Post, which was then picked up by various outlets (with headlines such as \u201cThe swamp of Washington\u2019s elite private schools want to drain themselves of Kellyanne Conway\u2019s kids,\u201d) said that she was in Washington with her children looking at schools last Wednesday.",
        "PHOENIX \u2014 To comprehend why this coming rematch isn\u2019t stale or blase, it helped to study the faces of Ohio State football players Saturday night as they exited both the Fiesta Bowl field and the calendar year 2016. These are extraordinary football players. Most spent high school with the adjective \u201ccoveted. \u201d Their mighty bodies scream of a human evolution. They play for the kingdom of Ohio State, which does not go around losing . Yet their faces suddenly carried a dose of shock and hint of haunt.",
        "There are people who comfortably can afford the 2017 Audi 3. 0T Quattro sedan with \u201ccompetition\u201d trim. \u201cComfortably\u201d means they can buy it immediately with cash; they easily can afford a car note of $800 or more without endangering funds for housing, food, health care, or education; they won the car in a competition of some sort. It is a fine automobile that, loaded with costly options, has most of the latest advanced electronic safety and technology. Truly, it is a car that can keep you alive, or otherwise safe from injury on a long drive.",
        "Ten years ago, my husband became sick with an autoimmune disease, and nutrition played a significant role in his recovery. What did I do when he got better? I became the food police, imagining that if I could control the food he and my kids ate, I could keep us all healthy and safe. I figured this made me a magnificent mom and wife as well; if my family was guzzling artichokes and homemade soups and never saw candy, I deserved high marks.",
        "It feels a lot like crumbling. A torrential wave of pain and grief filling every atom of your body. Denial that this could be reality, and piercing agony when you realize it is. Few have to experience this, and for that I am grateful. But for those of us who face the death of a child, the breath leaving their lungs while ours still inhale and exhale, we know this agony. When Debbie Reynolds, mother of the recently deceased actress Carrie Fisher, died just a day after her daughter, the world was shocked.",
        "For six years, since they took back the House of Representatives, Republicans have added to a pile of legislation that moldered outside the White House. In their thwarted agenda, financial regulations were to be unspooled. Business taxes were to be slashed. Planned Parenthood would be stripped of federal funds. The Affordable Care Act was teed up for repeal \u2014 dozens of times. When the 115th Congress begins this week, with Republicans firmly in charge of the House and Senate, much of that legislation will form the basis of the most ambitious conservative policy agenda since the 1920s.",
        "Democratic senators plan to aggressively target eight of Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees in the coming weeks and are pushing to stretch their confirmation votes into March \u2014 an unprecedented break with Senate tradition. Such delays would upend Republican hopes of quickly holding hearings and confirming most of Trump\u2019s top picks on Inauguration Day. But Democrats, hamstrung by their minority status, are determined to Trump\u2019s picks unless they start disclosing reams of personal financial data they\u2019ve withheld so far, according to senior aides.",
        "A bipartisan group of ethics advocates lobbed a second letter to Donald Trump on Monday evening warning him that he needs to do more to separate himself from his family business interests. The letter comes after Trump announced some changes in his business empire, with more expected before Inauguration Day. The letter signers include two conservative allies of Trump senior adviser Stephen K.",
        "By most measures, 2016 was the Republicans\u2019 year. They\u2019ll enter 2017 with majorities in Congress, governors\u2019 mansions and state legislatures, and as attorneys general, secretaries of state \u2014 you get the point. But Democrats and liberal advocates had some surprisingly major victories in 2016, especially on state referendums dealing with drugs, the minimum wage and guns. Here are the nine biggest state political and policy battles, divided into categories by which side won. Let\u2019s start with the Republicans first. wins 1. Republicans vs. Democrats Let\u2019s start with the most obvious battle line.",
        "Donald Trump has repeatedly questioned whether critical computer networks can ever be protected from intruders, alarming cybersecurity experts who say his comments could upend more than a decade of national cybersecurity policy and put both government and private data at risk. Asked late Saturday about Russian hacking allegations and his cybersecurity plans, Trump told reporters that \u201cno computer is safe\u201d and that, for intelligence officials, \u201chacking is a very hard thing to prove.",
        "SHILOH, West Bank \u2014 Through eight years of escalating criticism from the world\u2019s most powerful leader, Israeli construction in these sacred, militarily occupied hills never stopped. Thousands of homes were built. Miles of roadway. Restaurants. Shopping malls. A university. Here in Shiloh, a tourist center went up, with a welcome video in which the biblical figure Joshua commands the Jewish people to settle the land promised to them by God. Israeli settlements may be illegal in the eyes of the U. N. Security Council and a major obstacle to Middle East peace in the view of the Obama administration.",
        "BOSTON \u2014 Lindsay Weekes knew something was wrong as soon as her son was born. Her pregnancy had been easy. The baby was a strapping 6 pounds, 12 ounces, with thick, curly black hair like his father\u2019s. But from the first moment Quinlan drew air, Lindsey could see he was tense, his muscles rigid. Within 24 hours, Quinlan was whisked away from their hospital to an intensive care unit at a nearby medical university.",
        "Three weeks ago, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway sat on stage in a hotel ballroom in Washington and praised President Obama\u2019s handling of the transition. \u201cI was always raised to respect the office of the presidency and its current occupant, and I think that I have done that over the course of my adult life,\u201d she said. She added that Obama \u201chas been incredibly supportive and gracious . . . in wanting this peaceful transfer of power in our great democracy. \u201d Ten days later, Conway took exactly the opposite position."
