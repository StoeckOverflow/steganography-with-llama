        "Facts are stubborn things. Unfortunately in the age of Twitter journalism, too many reporters find such details to be both onerous and optional. This past week, I met twice with Donald Trump attempting to secure an interview for inauguration week. Judging from the snide reaction of some in the press, you would have thought I offered to sketch the outline of his inaugural speech. Our first meeting was a background discussion over dinner where we discussed topics ranging from Mexico to Cabinet nominees to Russia. Very little Trump said regarding Mexico and his Cabinet choices was groundbreaking.",
        "A single, unidentified source, according to the New York Post, says Donald Trump told Sen. Chuck Schumer ( . Y.) that he likes him better than Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (\u201che likes Schumer more than Ryan and McConnell because they both wanted him to lose\u201d). We cannot tell if Trump actually said it, let alone meant it, let alone will mean it a week or a day from now.",
        "Every time there\u2019s a change of control in Washington, the party taking power wants to believe it has an emphatic mandate from the American people to do everything on its agenda. After all, we just won, didn\u2019t we? Of course the public is behind us! Sometimes it\u2019s true, and when it comes to presidents, there\u2019s always a \u201choneymoon\u201d period in which even many people who didn\u2019t vote for the incoming president give him the benefit of the doubt and express optimism about his ability to succeed. Except not this year.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: When Donald Trump lies, is he telling a lie? Not if we cannot prove an intent to mislead, apparently. With Trump set to take control of the presidency, media figures are currently engaged in a spirited debate over how to handle the Trump administration\u2019s approach to the news media, now that it looks likely he will continue employing the unprecedented levels of dishonesty he wielded to great effect during the campaign. The early returns in this debate are not encouraging.",
        "\u201cWHY DON\u2019T you give up?\u201d That was one reader\u2019s suggestion after voters ignored our advice and elected Donald Trump president. Other readers proffered contrary counsel for the Trump era. We should oppose him at every turn, some say. Others, citing Mr. Trump\u2019s hunger for approval, think we should jolly him along, ignore his more objectionable tweets and give plenty of positive reinforcement when he does something commendable. None of those strategies strike us as quite right. But what should be the approach toward the coming Trump administration for those who saw his candidacy as not just unsupportable but dangerous?",
        "ISTANBUL \u2014 The Islamic State claimed responsibility Monday for a deadly rampage at an Istanbul nightclub on New Year\u2019s Eve, an assault by a single gunman that killed dozens of people and served as a brutal reminder of the consequences of Turkey\u2019s expanding war with the jihadists in Syria. A statement posted online said that a \u201cheroic soldier of the caliphate\u201d had attacked the nightclub with grenades and a rifle in \u201crevenge for God\u2019s religion\u201d and in response to orders from the Islamic State\u2019s leader, Abu Bakr who recently urged his followers to attack Turkey.",
        "JERUSALEM \u2014 Israeli police investigators questioned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for three hours Monday night as part of a criminal probe into whether he received bribes from wealthy businessmen. Although no charges have been filed, the questioning at the prime minister\u2019s official residence marked an escalation in a graft investigation. Afterward, the Israeli police released a short statement confirming that they had questioned Netanyahu over the allegations, but they provided no further details.",
        "ST. PETERSBURG \u2014 In a basement on a side street in St. Petersburg, 18 men holding reproduction Makarov pistols were fumbling through an exercise, racking the slides, taking aim and firing. Click, click, click, click, click. Repeat. Denis Gariev, the instructor, called out to pause the training. He was not about to air his political views, an ethnic nationalism so raw that he is far to the right of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He was about to rail against a society that had gone soft.",
        "Federal prosecutors on Tuesday will begin their bid to convince jurors that Dylann Storm Roof, the man who gunned down nine parishioners of Charleston\u2019s historic Mother Emanuel church in hopes of starting a race war, should be sentenced to death. Roof, 22, was convicted last month of federal hate crimes, and because prosecutors are seeking a death sentence, the same men and women who declared him guilty of 33 criminal charges must now decide his punishment.",
        "Joe Scarborough is sensitive to any suggestion that he is too cozy with Donald Trump, so it is no surprise that the MSNBC host pushed back when journalist Sopan Deb wrote Sunday on Twitter that Scarborough had \u201cpartied\u201d with Trump on New Year\u2019s Eve. But Scarborough\u2019s response \u2014 specifically the way he sought to undermine Deb\u2019s credibility \u2014 was exactly the kind of attack that the press doesn\u2019t need right now. The episode began when Deb, who recently left CBS News and will join the New York Times on Jan.",

        "We tasted the promise of the American dream as we toured the townhouse in suburban Atlanta. \u201cIf you want this house at all, make an offer before leaving today,\u201d our Realtor advised. This is a popular neighborhood, and houses typically sell within days. Yet my husband and I still rent. This decision equates to throwing away money every month, or so people warn.

        "Anyone who has tried to lose weight and keep it off knows how difficult the task can be. It seems as though it should be simple: Just exercise to burn more calories and reduce your calorie intake. But many studies have shown that this simple strategy doesn\u2019t work very well for the vast majority of people. A dramatic example of the challenges of maintaining weight loss comes from a recent National Institutes of Health study. The researchers followed 14 contestants who had participated in the \u201cBiggest Loser\u201d reality show.",

        "A day of pageantry to open the 115th Congress and usher in a new period of Republican governance was overtaken Tuesday by an embarrassing reversal on ethics oversight, with the GOP gripped by internal division and many lawmakers seeking to shield themselves from extensive scrutiny. The 19 hours of tumult was set in motion the night before behind closed doors at the Longworth House Office Building, where Republican lawmakers decided over the objections of Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) to amend House rules to effectively gut the independent Office of Congressional Ethics.",
        "The Trump effect has landed forcefully on Capitol Hill. Less than two hours after Donald Trump criticized House Republicans \u2014 in a tweet, of course \u2014 for trying to gut an ethics investigative unit on the first day of business in the new Congress, those plans lay in shambles in the Republican conference\u2019s meeting room.

Ryan ( .) and his leadership team had hoped to protect.",
        "Update: As of noon on Tuesday, House Republicans have reversed course dropping the amendment that would have gutted the Office of Congressional Ethics from the overall rules package.

But when the results of the presidential election became clear, the retired attorney in Hawaii turned to Facebook and asked: What if women marched on Washington around Inauguration Day en masse? She asked her online friends how to create an event page, and then started one for the march she was hoping would happen. By the time she went to bed, 40 women responded that they were in. When she woke up, that number had exploded to 10, 000.",

        "Doesn\u2019t anybody here know how to work this thing? For 10 years, Republicans have waited for their chance to govern, and finally the voters handed them the car keys: unified GOP control of Congress and the White House.

        "FOR THE most part, Tuesday\u2019s opening session of the 115th Congress was about pomp and circumstance. Still, the prepared speeches and ceremonies reminded everyone that \u2014 for all the ferment over an impending Donald Trump presidency \u2014 there is also a legislative branch of government in the United States.
