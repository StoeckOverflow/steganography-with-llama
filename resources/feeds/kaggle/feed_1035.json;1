        "Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, are one step closer to solidifying their Washington takeover, er, relocation. Trump, Kushner and the couple\u2019s three children will move to Kalorama after her father takes office. The couple\u2019s new home is on Tracy Place NW, just blocks from the house the Obamas will be renting during their bonus stint in the District. The house sold on Dec. 22 for $5. 5 million, but it is unclear whether the couple bought the home themselves or whether they\u2019ll be renting from its new owner.",
        "The flight from Australia to the United States is one of the longest in the world, and feels even longer in a middle seat. It turned out drastically shorter for one passenger, whose profane complaints grounded his flight and led to his reported arrest after a few hours in the air. Described by authorities as a American, the man boarded a United Airlines flight on New Year\u2019s Day \u2014 due in San Francisco more than 13 hours later, along with 251 other passengers.",
        "For dinosaurs, hatching eggs was a commitment. A nest pinned the parents down to the spot where the eggs were laid. As long as they were incubating their eggs, they couldn\u2019t venture off in search of food or to flee predators. And their eggs incubated for a very long time. That\u2019s according to Gregory Erickson, a paleobiologist at Florida State University and the lead author of a new study on dinosaur hatching times in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",
        "Those who know me might think it out of character that I am contributing to WaPo Food\u2019s 5 Diets project, because I believe \u201cdiet\u201d is a word \u2014 one that connotes an unsustainable, sometimes fix. But as a registered dietitian who spent years in private practice, I have learned that many people have no structure or strategy at all in their eating. They desperately need some kind of plan, an effective set of brakes, and it is often at this January juncture that they grasp for one.",
        "The first shots were fired just before 9 p. m. A protest against deadly shootings by police was winding down in Dallas, with demonstrators making their way back to their cars, when officers heard the initial burst of gunfire. By the time it was over, five police officers had been killed, several others were injured and a lone gunman was dead after a standoff with officers. The Dallas ambush was the deadliest day for law enforcement since Sept. 11, 2001.",
        "Congressional Republicans on Wednesday launched their effort to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, even as they acknowledged that they may need several months to develop a replacement along conservative lines. Signifying how enormous a priority the issue is for the incoming administration, Vice Mike Pence met privately to discuss it with House and Senate Republicans. He offered no details afterward about what a new law might look like but vowed to unwind the existing one through a mixture of executive actions and legislation.",
        "A House panel formed by Republicans to investigate the procurement of human fetal tissue for medical research has recommended stripping federal funds from Planned Parenthood, heralding a new congressional assault on the nation\u2019s largest provider of abortions and women\u2019s health care. The GOP majority on the Select Investigative Panel included the recommendation in the final report, which was issued Tuesday on the dissolution of the panel. It was formed in 2015 after antiabortion activists recorded a series of undercover videos that they said documented abuses by abortion providers and intermediaries that provide fetal tissue to researchers.",
        "Donald Trump tweeted some praise on Tuesday for a man most Republicans wanted nothing to do with. He had seen Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, defend himself during an hour of friendly, questions on Fox News. And he was impressed. \u201cJulian Assange said a \u2018 old could have hacked Podesta,\u2019 \u201d Trump wrote. \u201cWhy was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info. \u201d It wasn\u2019t the first time Trump had praised WikiLeaks. During his campaign for president, Trump had gleefully highlighted emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.",
        "Donald Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday night to say that a planned intelligence briefing for him on \u201c \u2018 \u2019\u201d had been delayed until Friday, a development he called \u2018very strange!\u201d but one that a U. S. official said wasn\u2019t a delay at all. The tweet was the latest sign of Trump\u2019s skepticism about a case pressed by the Obama administration, based on the work of U. S. intelligence and agencies, that Russia tried to influence the U. S. presidential election by hacking several Democratic email accounts, among other actions. Several leading Republicans have also endorsed that view.",
        "SHANGHAI \u2014 Elevator rides are not usually worth documenting. But when you step into the elevator at Shanghai Tower, people often pull out their cameras. As the doors close, a screen at the elevator\u2019s front lights up to show you the car\u2019s location as it rises toward the building\u2019s newly opened observation deck. A neatly dressed attendant informs passengers that the elevator has now reached a top speed of 18 meters per second, approximately 40 mph. \u201cThis is really fast,\u201d one passenger said during a recent packed ride up the tower.",
        "Department store giant Macy\u2019s said Wednesday that it plans to slash more than 10, 000 jobs and will close its location at Landmark Mall in Alexandria, Va. as part of a previously announced plan to shutter 100 of its 730 stores nationwide, a coda to a disappointing holiday season. Early evidence suggests that the retail industry pulled down a solid holiday sales haul this year: Consumer confidence is high, growth in online spending was robust in December, and a blast of cold weather encouraged people to get shopping. And yet Macy\u2019s struggled to get a piece of the action.",
        "Any summation of Barack Obama\u2019s impact on domestic policy and politics should begin with this: In 2008, he assured supporters, \u201cWe are the ones we\u2019ve been waiting for. We are the change that we seek. \u201d Soon he will be replaced by someone who says, \u201cI alone can fix it. \u201d So, Americans have paid Obama the compliment of choosing continuity, if only in presidential narcissism. The nation has now had, for only the second time, three consecutive presidencies.",
        "In the new Disney animated film \u201cMoana,\u201d the once mighty but now fallen demigod Maui, in the voice of Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson, sings about his earlier triumphs in hopes of earning admiration: What can I say except you\u2019re welcome For the tides, the sun, the sky? Hey, it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay You\u2019re welcome I\u2019m just an ordinary . . . I lassoed the sun You\u2019re welcome! To stretch the days and bring you fun Also I harnessed the breeze You\u2019re welcome!",
        "Hugh Hewitt hosts a nationally syndicated radio show and is author of the forthcoming \u201cThe Fourth Way: The Conservative Playbook for a Lasting GOP Majority. \u201d Is it better to be thought a lightweight and dismissed by rivals if you are in fact talented, ambitious and ready to strike? To be thought clueless when in fact you have a plan? Now for the stretch on your part \u2014 and mine: What if Donald Trump is playing the Russians and Vladimir Putin as effectively as he played the U. S. media throughout 2015 and 2016?",
        "Will Donald Trump deprive President Obama of what we have come to think of as a normal the relatively serene life of reflection, writing, philanthropy and speeches to friendly audiences? In recent decades, we have become accustomed to the idea of who leave political combat behind. They might occasionally speak out on behalf of their party: Bill Clinton was an effective \u201cexplainer in chief\u201d for Obama at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. But with some exceptions (Jimmy Carter on the Middle East comes to mind) they usually avoided trying to influence policy.",
        "John Maynard Keynes wrote that gut feelings \u2014 or \u201canimal spirits,\u201d as he called them \u2014 were often more important to investment decisions than a \u201cmathematical expectation. \u201d Donald Trump, too, understands animal spirits. It\u2019s just that the animal he has in mind is a sheep. Or so it seems from the way he is forcefully herding American automakers back across the U. S. border, like so many wayward ovines \u2014 with Twitter as his digital crook. And if the companies\u2019 response to this blatant political of their supposedly free enterprises is any indication, Trump has read Detroit right.",
        "SOME REPUBLICANS \u2014 including Donald Trump \u2014 appear to be entirely unconcerned about the strong evidence that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign in order to create uncertainty in the presidential race, or tilt it toward Mr. Trump. Either that, or they are determined to bury the story of an unprecedented intrusion into American democracy by a hostile foreign power. There\u2019s no other way to understand a new set of tweets by Mr. Trump, or the sandbagging by Republican leaders of proposals for a thorough investigation.",
        "CHARLESTON \u2014 Six weeks after he shot and killed nine people at a Charleston church, Dylann Roof lamented in a jailhouse journal that he could no longer go to the movies or eat good food. But he still felt the massacre was \u201cworth it\u201d because of what he perceived as the wrongs perpetrated by the black community. \u201cI would like to make it crystal clear, I do not regret what I did,\u201d Roof wrote. \u201cI am not sorry.",
        "Ford chief executive Mark Fields said Tuesday the automaker was ditching its plans to open a factory in Mexico and instead expanding a Michigan plant, creating 700 more local jobs. The next wave of workers in Flat Rock will build mostly and electric cars, including a hybrid Mustang. Unlike manufacturing roles of decades past, though, the jobs will probably require computer literacy and more than a high school degree. \u201cThe era of the electric vehicle is dawning,\u201d Fields told his employees this week, \u201cand we at Ford plan to be a leader in this exciting future.",
        "Some of the nation\u2019s biggest Internet providers are asking the government to roll back a landmark set of privacy regulations it approved last fall \u2014 kicking off an effort by the industry and its allies to dismantle key Internet policies of the Obama years. In a petition filed to federal regulators Monday, a top Washington trade group whose members include Comcast, Charter and Cox argued that the rules should be thrown out.",
        "Two of the nation\u2019s largest credit reporting bureaus, TransUnion and Equifax, will together pay more than $23 million in fines and refunds to settle charges from a federal consumer watchdog that they misled consumers about the pricing and value of credit products. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said Tuesday that the companies deceived consumers by suggesting that the credit scores they provided were the same scores used by financial firms to make lending decisions when in fact, the scores \u201cwere not typically used by lenders.",
        "RICHMOND \u2014 A Virginia legislator has filed a bill to regulate transgender people\u2019s use of restrooms in schools, at highway rest stops and in other government buildings \u2014 a proposal akin to a controversial North Carolina law. The legislation from Del. Robert G.",
        "American drivers bought more new cars and trucks in 2016 than they ever have, edging out the record set just one year earlier to give the auto industry an unprecedented seventh consecutive year of sales growth. About 17. 5 million light vehicles were sold throughout the country last year, manufacturers reported Wednesday, an increase of less than half a percent over the record set in 2015.",
        "For the first time, scientists have nailed down a source of fast radio bursts, one of astronomy\u2019s most enigmatic phenomena. A dim dwarf galaxy 2. 5 billion light years from Earth is sending out the mysterious blasts of radio waves, researchers report Wednesday in Nature and Astrophysical Journal Letters. The bursts traverse vast expanses of time and intergalactic space before reaching our planet.",
        "Well, they only had to remake a jillion TV shows from yesteryear to finally get one exactly, perfectly right. Not only is Netflix\u2019s reimagined \u201cOne Day at a Time\u201d a joy to watch, it\u2019s also the first time in many years that a multicamera sitcom (the kind filmed on a set with laughter) has seemed so instinctively comfortable in its own skin. It doesn\u2019t try to subvert or improve on the sitcom format; it simply exhibits faith that the sitcom genre can still work in a refreshing and relevant way.",
        "Emad had just sat down for coffee with his wife Fayza and one of his daughters when they heard gunshots. That morning in March, captured a video, now evidence at the center of a trial that has divided a nation. The video shows Sgt. Elor Azaria, an Israeli army medic, shooting and killing Abdul Fattah who lay unarmed and wounded. As Ruth Eglash of The Washington Post reported, the incident happened shortly after and a friend, Ramzi attacked Israeli troops and wounded one soldier. Israeli forces shot both of the men, killing immediately.",
        "Senior officials in the Russian government celebrated Donald Trump\u2019s victory over Hillary Clinton as a geopolitical win for Moscow, according to U. S. officials who said that American intelligence agencies intercepted communications in the aftermath of the election in which Russian officials congratulated themselves on the outcome. The ebullient reaction among Russian officials \u2014 including some who U. S. officials believe had knowledge of the country\u2019s cyber campaign to interfere in the U. S. election \u2014 contributed to the U. S.",
        "The country\u2019s top intelligence official testified to Congress on Thursday that Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign went well beyond hacking to include disinformation and the dissemination of \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 an effort, he said, that continues to this day. \u201cWhatever crack, fissure, they could find in our tapestry . . . they would exploit it,\u201d said Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee on foreign cybersecurity threats, especially Russian hacking and interference in the election.",
        "House Republicans this week reinstated an arcane procedural rule that enables lawmakers to reach deep into the budget and slash the pay of an individual federal worker \u2014 down to $1 \u2014 a move that threatens to upend the civil service. The Holman Rule, named after an Indiana congressman who devised it in 1876, empowers any member of Congress to propose amending an appropriations bill to single out a government employee or cut a specific program.",
        "Some of the most conservative members of Congress say they are ready to vote for a budget that would \u2014 at least on paper \u2014 balloon the deficit to more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade, all for the sake of eventually repealing the Affordable Care Act. In a dramatic reversal, many members of the House Freedom Caucus said Thursday they are prepared later this month to support a budget measure that would explode the deficit and increase the public debt to more than $29. 1 trillion by 2026, figures contained in the budget resolution itself."
