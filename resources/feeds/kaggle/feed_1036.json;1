        "MOUNT AIRY, N. C. \u2014 From a perch on Main Street, the home town of actor Andy Griffith looks this day like it was plucked right out of the television show that bears his name. And it was. Residents and tourists from states mill along the thoroughfare, past the quaint shops made of Mount Airy\u2019s famous white granite and named, like Floyd\u2019s City Barber Shop, for references in \u201cThe Andy Griffith Show,\u201d the folksy comedy set in the idyllic fictional small town of Mayberry that first aired in 1960.",
        "Jim McDermott, a Democrat, represented Washington in the House of Representatives from 1989 until his retirement this week. As the new Congress begins its work this week, Donald Trump continues to call for repeal of the Affordable Care Act. However, rather than propose wholesale repeal \u2014 as many on the right would prefer \u2014 he is seeking to maintain some of the law\u2019s most popular provisions. We don\u2019t have the full details of Trump\u2019s plan \u2014 or any Republican plan, for that matter \u2014 but we are starting to see its bones develop.",
        "Believe it or not, Americans like Obamacare. They just don\u2019t know they like Obamacare. That is, the law known as \u201cObamacare\u201d and \u201cthe Affordable Care Act\u201d is relatively unpopular. But most of the things that this disreputable law does are incredibly popular. Consider the prohibition on denying insurance coverage due to preexisting conditions. Seven in 10 Americans, including 6 in 10 Republicans, support this provision, according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll.",
        "One of the most confusing shifts of the Trump ascendancy is, on reflection, one of the most clarifying. Donald Trump\u2019s, Sarah Palin\u2019s and Sean Hannity\u2019s embrace of Julian Assange \u2014 who has made a career of illegally obtaining and releasing documents damaging to U. S. interests \u2014 is not just a puzzling policy shift. It is the triumph of political tribalism over, well, every other principle or commitment. All three leaders of populism once saw the risk. Not long ago, Trump recommended the death penalty for Assange. Now he publicly sides with him against U. S. intelligence services.",
        "You can kick the can down the road, but when Kim Jong Un announces, as he did last Sunday, that \u201cwe have reached the final stage in preparations to an intercontinental ballistic rocket,\u201d you are reaching the end of that road. Since the early 1990s, we have offered every kind of inducement to get North Korea to give up its nuclear program. All failed miserably. Pyongyang managed to extort money, food, oil and commercial nuclear reactors in exchange. But it was all a swindle.",
        "Who says there isn\u2019t bipartisan agreement in Washington? At the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing chaired by Sen. John McCain ( .) Democrats and Republicans alike agreed that cyberterrorism is a threat to the United States and that Russia is one of the key bad actors. Defense Undersecretary for Intelligence Marcel J. Lettre II, National Security Agency Director Michael S. Rogers and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. were measured, authoritative and humble in their appearance, not an easy task to pull off.",
        "FIFTEEN MONTHS and nearly $1. 6 million later, a House panel investigating Planned Parenthood and fetal tissue research ended up where it started: with no evidence of wrongdoing. That has not deterred the Republicans from proposing a political agenda so extreme it should scare not only those who care about women\u2019s health care but also anyone who values science and its contributions. The GOP majority on the cynically named Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives summed up its work in a document issued Tuesday that was highlighted by its call to strip all federal funding from Planned Parenthood.",
        "Donald Trump is expected to name former senator Daniel Coats ( .) to be his director of national intelligence, a position some of Trump\u2019s own advisers suggest is unneeded, a Trump transition team official said Thursday. Coats, who is seen as a traditional Republican, served a total of 16 years in the Senate during two separate stretches and was ambassador to Germany during George W. Bush\u2019s presidency. His selection comes at a time when the incoming administration\u2019s views on the quality and value of U. S. are unclear at best.",
        "Authorities in Chicago charged four young African American adults with hate crimes Thursday after a video broadcast live on Facebook appeared to show them shouting obscenities about Donald Trump and white people while abusing a man authorities say has mental health problems. The footage, which Chicago\u2019s top police officer labeled \u201csickening,\u201d quickly went viral online. In the shaky video, a terrified young white man in a gray hooded sweatshirt and dark pants is seen crouching in a corner, his wrists and neck bound with orange bands, his mouth taped shut.",
        "Donald Trump continued his Twitter tirade against the auto industry on Thursday, slamming Toyota for investing in Mexico but appearing to misstate key details of the company\u2019s operations. Trump warned the Japanese carmaker over Twitter that it could face hefty fines for building a plant in Baja, Mexico, to sell the popular Corolla sedan to American consumers. But Trump\u2019s tweet looks to be incorrect: Toyota\u2019s factory in Baja assembles Tacoma trucks, according to the automaker. A new plant in Guanajuato, Mexico, will manufacture Corollas. That factory broke ground in November, and production is expected to begin in 2019.",
        "CHARLESTON, S. C. \u2014 Federal prosecutors on Thursday fully unveiled the racist screed that Dylann Roof penned from a jail cell after he shot and killed nine innocent churchgoers here, using the rant to draw a sharp contrast with emotional testimony from the loved ones of those Roof killed. The journal brought a dramatic end to the second day of the penalty phase in Roof\u2019s trial. Jurors are considering whether to sentence him to life in prison, or to death. Roof spared virtually no group from his ire, and he made clear he did not regret what he did.",
        "BERLIN \u2014 The Tunisian man who plowed a truck into a Berlin Christmas market had lived under 14 aliases and was so well known to German officials that a key counterterrorism committee had discussed his case seven times, suggesting the scale of the missed opportunities to thwart the Dec. 19 attack. The fresh details about Anis Amri \u2014 shot dead in Italy four days after the attack \u2014 emerged Thursday during testimony in the regional parliament of North where the suspect once lived. German officials have already said that Amri had previously been flagged as a terrorism threat.",
        "The United States has sent four Yemeni prisoners from the facility at Guantanamo Bay to Saudi Arabia, the Pentagon said Thursday, part of a final rush to resettle detainees before the Trump administration clamps down on movements out of the prison. The inmates include Muhammad Ali Abdullah Muhammad Bawazir, whose treatment during a lengthy hunger strike was addressed in a federal court case; Salem Ahmad Hadi Bin Kanad, who was shot during an Afghanistan prison riot in 2001 but later recovered; and Mohammed Rajab Sadiq Abu Ghanim and Abdallah Yahya Yusif .",
        "Don\u2019t cry for Rupert Murdoch. Despite making a personal appeal and proffering bags of money, the billionaire mogul couldn\u2019t secure the loyalty of Megyn Kelly, the attraction of the most successful outpost of his multimedia empire, Fox News. As announced Tuesday, Kelly will decamp to NBC for a very large payday, reportedly more than $20 million a year, and various roles. Fox moved quickly to plug the gap, naming veteran host Tucker Carlson on Thursday as her replacement at 9 p. m. Murdoch probably isn\u2019t too worried.",
        "Once the virus hits, the attacks are often swift and brutal. The stomach and intestines become inflamed. Bouts of vomiting and diarrhea follow that leave victims weak and exhausted. And since the bug is extremely contagious, it can spread easily to others, especially in places like centers, schools, cruise ships and nursing homes. If all of this sounds familiar to those of you who were laid viciously low over the holidays, it\u2019s because the arrival of cold weather usually coincides with an increase in one of winter\u2019s most dreaded horrors: norovirus.",
        "There are lots of losers in the rise of Donald Trump. The systematically took apart everyone from Jeb Bush through Hillary Clinton on his way to the White House. But there\u2019s no one who has been forced to suffer more at the hands of Trump than New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. The latest indignity came earlier this week when Bill Stepien, Christie\u2019s onetime confidant, was named White House political director.",
        "QUANTICO, Va. \u2014 Drill instructors at the Marine Corps recruit center at Parris Island, S. C. drank alcohol on the job and repeatedly ordered recruits to do illegal calisthenics in a decrepit building called \u201cthe dungeon,\u201d recruits testified here Thursday. The allegation emerged as Staff Sgt. Antonio B. Burke, a Parris Island drill instructor, became the first Marine to face a hearing in a series of cases involving hazing and abuse allegations over the past couple of years. Burke is charged with cruelty and maltreatment, failure to obey a lawful general order and making a false official statement.",
        "The beginning seems so far away now. Eight years ago, the nation elected its first African American president and put a black family in the White House. Many reveled in the moment, the promise and the pride of it. A country not yet 150 years from slavery had reached a huge milestone. On a frigid January morning, Barack Hussein Obama took his first oath of office, using Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Bible, a book of red and gold splendor that Michelle Obama held as daughters Malia and Sasha watched. To be first means glory and pain.",
        "Russia carried out a comprehensive cybercampaign to sabotage the U. S. presidential election, an operation that was ordered by Russian President Vladi mir Putin and ultimately sought to help elect Donald Trump, U. S. intelligence agencies concluded in a remarkably blunt assessment released Friday. The report depicts Russian interference as unprecedented in scale, saying that Moscow\u2019s role represented \u201ca significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort\u201d beyond previous espionage. The campaign initially sought to undermine public faith in the U. S. democratic process, \u201cdenigrate\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and damage her expected presidency.",
        "Police said a lone gunman opened fire Friday at the Fort Lauderdale, Fla. international airport, killing five people in a brief shooting rampage that sent several others to the hospital. The bloody attack at a quiet baggage claim area sent people scrambling through the terminals and across the airfield at one of the country\u2019s busiest airports, shutting down all flights while paramedics and federal and local law enforcement officers flooded the scene. The suspected shooter is in custody, and it appears he acted alone, said Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel.",
        "This story has been updated. An enormous rift in one of Antarctica\u2019s largest ice shelves grew dramatically over the past month, and a chunk nearly the size of Delaware could break away as soon as later this winter, British scientists reported this week. If this happens, it could accelerate a further breakup of the ice shelf, essentially removing a massive cork of ice that keeps some of Antarctica\u2019s glaciers from flowing into the ocean. The long term result, scientists project, could be to noticeably raise global sea levels by 10 centimeters, or almost four inches.",
        "In a bid to swiftly deliver on one of Donald Trump\u2019s chief campaign promises, congressional Republicans are exploring ways to begin funding a barrier on the U. S. southern border starting as soon as April. Multiple lawmakers described the plans Thursday, which would use authority under a 2006 law supported by Republicans and Democrats alike to justify spending that could eventually reach into the billions of dollars. [Trump says building a U. S. wall is \u2018easy.\u2019 But is it really?] From the beginning of this campaign, Trump pledged to \u201cbuild a wall and make Mexico pay for it.",
        "With a few taps of his thumbs, Donald Trump again planted himself atop the news pages in Mexico. This time it was that old familiar saw: Who\u2019s going to pay for the wall? Mexico! he trumpeted as usual \u2014 but this time with a twist. Any money \u201cspent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed) will be paid back by Mexico later!\u201d he tweeted. Mexico, which has repeatedly insisted it will not put a penny into constructing the wall, again took to the Internet to defend itself.",
        "As we enter the administration of a president who is both prolific on Twitter and prone to tweeting factual inaccuracies, the Fact Checker faced a conundrum: How much effort should we devote to Donald Trump\u2019s tweets? Tweets are ephemeral \u2014 in theory, at least. By the time we start on one fact check of Trump\u2019s tweet, he may have tweeted many others that are . Many of Trump\u2019s tweets are easy to debunk and do not rise to the level of a Pinocchio rating. In fact, Twitter users often correct Trump within minutes, in fewer than 140 characters.",
        "Here we go, down the rabbit hole. Donald Trump won the presidency by feeding Americans a diet of falsehoods and fake news, and, when challenged, he lashed out: shouting down the opposition, bullying the accuser and, particularly, blaming the media. It was inevitable that his success would bring imitators. Now they have arrived, and they\u2019re breeding like, well . . . Consider Rep. Duncan Hunter ( .) of the Trump caucus in the House and one of the first members of Congress to endorse Trump.",
        "For decades, united conservatives behind the Republican Party. An otherwise disparate collection of national security hawks, enthusiasts and social traditionalists rallied to the GOP, resolutely committed to checking Soviet influence around the world. All of these constituencies had reason to despise godless, Bolsheviks. Although Russia no longer subscribes to doctrine, it still presents a threat to the United States, its allies and the liberal world order. Witness its aggression against Ukraine, its intervention in Syria\u2019s civil war and its support for extremists across Europe. In Donald Trump, the GOP nominated the most U. S.",
        "This post was updated at 11:55 a. m. Jan. 6. The honeymoon seems to be ending between retired Gen. James N. Mattis and Donald Trump\u2019s transition team amid an increasingly acrimonious dispute over who will get top jobs in the Defense Department \u2014 and who gets to make those decisions. With only two weeks left before Inauguration Day and days before Mattis\u2019s Senate confirmation hearing, most major Pentagon civilian positions remain unfilled. Behind the scenes, Mattis has been rejecting large numbers of candidates offered by the transition team for several top posts, two sources close to the transition said.",
        "It\u2019s never all that hard to find examples of politicians in either party being hypocrites, accusing their opponents of things they themselves are guilty of or flipping 180 degrees on supposedly heartfelt positions when it looks to be to their momentary advantage. But the Republicans now taking power in Washington are bringing hypocrisy to spectacular new heights.",
        "Coming from a presidential candidate, Donald Trump\u2019s admiration of Russia and its autocratic leader was weird. Coming from a it\u2019s nothing short of alarming. I repeat the questions I asked back in September: What\u2019s the deal with Trump and Russia? Does he have financial entanglements with Russian banks, businesses or billionaires that color his views? If not, as he claims, then why won\u2019t he release the personal and business tax returns that could put the matter to rest? The latest sign of Trump\u2019s infatuation is his refusal to accept the conclusion of the U. S.",
        "The essence of my job as a critic is to look at things, even things I\u2019d rather not see. This week, for example, I watched people being scalded with hot water, crucified below the tide line, hanged in pits and beheaded in Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cSilence. \u201d Images of split flesh often bother me, but I read my way through Roxane Gay\u2019s \u201cDifficult Women\u201d fascinated by her descriptions of fat and meat."
