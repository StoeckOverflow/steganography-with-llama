        "First lady Michelle Obama was visibly moved as she concluded her final official speech at the White House, part of a ceremony for educators honoring the 2017 school counselor of the year. Obama thanked teachers and advocates \u201call across this nation who get up every day and work their hearts out to lift up our young people.",
        "The 114th Congress ended this week, and with it went the confirmation chances of more than 80 qualified men and women nominated to government positions at all levels. On this Going Nowhere List are Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland and many others whose names had been put forward for positions. I was one of them. My concept of public service was framed by the civics of \u201cSchoolhouse Rock\u201d: A president nominates men and women who have particular skills and experience that qualify them to hold specific government positions.",
        "A major winter storm is churning across the Southeast. The snow began to accumulate in Mississippi and Alabama in the morning hours Friday, and by Saturday afternoon as much as 15 inches could be on the ground in parts of the Carolinas. If forecasts are right, Interstate 95 shutdowns are possible, if not likely. Many parts of the Southeast haven\u2019t seen snow like this in more than a decade. The coastal winter storm will slice across the South and through Saturday.",
        "Tilikum, the most famous killer whale in the United States, died Friday after a illness and quarter century of performances streaked with violence. The orca \u2014 believed to be 36 years old and linked to the deaths of three people in that time \u2014 likely succumbed to a lung infection early in the morning, according to a statement released by SeaWorld. The whale died at the Orlando marine park where he spent most of his life, \u201csurrounded by the trainers, care staff and veterinarians that provided him care,\u201d the statement reads.",
        "As a new year dawns, we\u2019re greeted with more of the same from Hollywood: superhero movies, sequels, reboots and origin stories. But that\u2019s not all there will be in 2017. There are also a few films that feature no caped crusaders nor lightsaber battles. It\u2019s a little early to definitively predict which titles will be worth watching, but we can hazard a few guesses. Here\u2019s a look at some promising entertainment, conveniently categorized by cinematic tastes.",
        "A top ethics official has warned that plans to confirm Donald Trump\u2019s top Cabinet choices before background examinations are complete are unprecedented and have overwhelmed government investigators responsible for the reviews. The concerns prompted Democrats on Saturday to call for delaying the confirmation process, but Republicans signaled they are unlikely to budge on the eve of a slew of hearings in the Senate.",
        "Democrats are pushing to delay next week\u2019s confirmation hearing for Betsy DeVos, Donald Trump\u2019s pick for education secretary, until a federal watchdog agency finishes reviewing her background and financial investments for possible conflicts of interest or other ethics concerns. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) is scheduled to hold a confirmation hearing Jan. 11 for DeVos, a Michigan billionaire. She is one of several Trump nominees whose vast wealth and considerable financial holdings have overwhelmed the bipartisan Office of Government Ethics, which is responsible for vetting Cabinet nominees.",
        "Sen. Jeff Sessions ( .) should have been a tough sell in the U. S. Senate. Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general voted to impeach Clinton, opposed President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominees and led the opposition to a 2013 bipartisan immigration bill. He was also denied a federal judgeship 30 years ago \u2014 by the U. S. Senate \u2014 amid allegations that as U. S. attorney he had improperly prosecuted black activists and used racially intemperate language.",
        "Donald Trump has made plenty of news since he won the election, but the coming week should be the most important of the period by far, a moment when tweets and mixed signals could give way to greater clarity about the incoming president and his administration. For weeks Trump has been mostly out of sight, heard from mostly in random, bursts that have rattled cages from Capitol Hill to corporate boardrooms to world capitals. But for all the running commentary, Trump\u2019s transition has been particularly opaque.",
        "TAL ABYAD, Syria \u2014 In a former high school classroom in this northeastern Syrian town, about 250 Arab recruits for the U. S. war against the Islamic State were being prepped by Kurdish instructors to receive military training from American troops. Most of the recruits were from villages surrounding the Islamic State\u2019s capital of Raqqa, and the expectation is that they will be deployed to the battle for the predominantly Arab city, which is now the main target of the U. S. military effort in Syria.",
        "The suspected gunman in an airport shooting rampage in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. \u2014 Esteban Santiago, 26, an Iraq War veteran \u2014 has been charged with federal crimes and could face the death penalty, the Justice Department announced Saturday night. Santiago showed signs of violence and what authorities called \u201cerratic behavior\u201d in the months before they said he traveled 4, 000 miles from home, loaded a gun in a baggage area and killed five people in some 80 seconds.",
        "Esteban Santiago grabbed his bag from the luggage carousel at the Fort International Airport and walked to the bathroom. There, he pulled bullets and a 9 mm pistol from his baggage, loaded the weapon and returned to fire randomly at his fellow travelers, authorities said Friday. A minute later, they said, he had killed five people, injured six and raised questions about how a person bent on harming people could legally fly across the country with a gun, then use it to attack unsuspecting passengers. The answer: very easily.",
        "First, a history refresher: For the past nine years, a smattering of Americans, most recently led by our now have insisted that Barack Obama is a Muslim born in Kenya. For years, Donald Trump was unrelenting in his insistence that Obama prove beyond existing proof that he was born in Hawaii and not in the African country of his biological father. That Obama said he is a Christian wasn\u2019t enough to persuade Trump\u2019s followers, who apparently know a Christian when they see one.",
        "The approaching presidency of Donald Trump poses daunting challenges for the journalists covering him, not merely because he has described them as dishonest, scum or because of anxiety over whether the new administration will adhere to basic norms of access, such as daily briefings and regular news conferences. The \u2019s behavior presents fundamental questions, recurring daily if not hourly, about the best way to serve our audience. These are technical issues of craft, ordinarily of interest only to journalists themselves. In the Age of Trump, they are imbued with consequences.",
        "Mitt Romney, a Republican, was governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007. In 2012, he was the Republican nominee for president. The nomination of Betsy DeVos for secretary of education has reignited the battle over education policy. The heat is already intense not just because it involves the future of our children but also because a lot of money is at stake.",
        "George Ball is chairman and chief executive of the W. Atlee Burpee & Co. and a past president of the American Horticultural Society. In 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt famously used his first 100 days as president to attack the demons of the Great Depression. All new presidents since have had a gantlet to confront the ills that face them. Having run more than five gantlets since announcing his candidacy in June 2015, Donald Trump has had practice facing demons. On Jan. 20, a newly inaugurated President Trump will begin to battle in earnest with the D. C.",
        "When Barack Obama moves two miles from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to 2446 Belmont Road in Washington\u2019s Kalorama neighborhood, he will live half a mile from 2340 S Street, where Woodrow Wilson spent his three years. Wilson\u2019s embittering foreign policy failure was the Senate\u2019s rejection of U. S. participation in the embodiment of Wilsonian aspirations, the League of Nations. Obama leaves office serene because, as he put it, \u201calmost every country on Earth sees America as stronger and more respected today than they did eight years ago.",
        "HOUSE REPUBLICANS caused an understandable furor this week when they proposed to gut the House ethics office and then reconsidered. That debacle diverted attention from another baleful \u201creform\u201d that did succeed. Members of Congress awarded themselves the power to slash the annual pay of any federal employee to as low as $1, thereby essentially telling government workers to forget about protection: Their jobs now may rise or fall on political whim.",
        "MOSCOW \u2014 Russian commentators on Saturday dismissed, with no small amount of derision, the conclusion by U. S. intelligence agencies that President Vladi mir Putin personally ordered a campaign to sabotage the American presidential election. Few in Russia have ever accepted the notion that the Kremlin intervened to hurt Hillary Clinton and help Donald Trump, but the declassified report, lacking as it was in details, drew instant contempt from Moscow\u2019s chattering classes. \u201cThis is one more giant fake,\u201d tweeted Alexei Pushkov, a senior Russian legislator and erstwhile pundit.",
        "Recent news that NAACP President Cornell William Brooks and five others had been arrested and charged with misdemeanor criminal trespassing for a at one of the offices of Sen. Jeff Sessions thrust the longtime civil rights organization to the forefront of a nascent resistance movement against Donald Trump, his policies and some of his Cabinet picks. It was also a chance for the civil rights organization to try to update its image and tactics.",
        "The economy today is far from perfect, but as Barack Obama leaves office, he is leaving it far better than he found it. In fact, Obama ends his administration with the drop in the unemployment rate during a presidency since the New Deal helped pull the nation out of the Great Depression. The rate under Obama is bested only by the one under Bill Clinton, which fell from 7. 3 percent in January 1993 to 3. 9 percent in December 2000. As Obama took office amid the depths of the recession, the unemployment rate was 7. 8 percent.",
        "Sometimes, you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know. The search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared in March 2014, proves that adage again and again. The jet vanished, seemingly into thin air, with 239 people aboard. There was no distress call, no plea for help from a frantic pilot. There wasn\u2019t even enough satellite data to identify exactly where the thing might be. Instead, there were rumors. Lots and lots of rumors. A hijacking?",
        "A survey of 2, 000 U. S. physicians released in September found that roughly half believed they had met criteria for a mental health disorder in the past but had not sought treatment. The doctors listed a number of reasons they had shunned care, including worries that they\u2019d be stigmatized and an inability to find the time. But they also voiced a troubling reason for avoiding treatment: medical licensing applications. After graduating from medical school, doctors must complete residency training and apply for state medical licenses to practice medicine.",
        "Accumulating snow has ended for most of us, leaving a nice coating across the District and some more substantial snow totals along the Chesapeake Bay and Eastern Shore. Things get quite cold tonight with combined temperatures and wind chill values giving a real feel of close to or below zero. Through tonight: Bitter cold conditions overnight. With the loss of daylight, wet spots will refreeze so watch out for black ice. Temperatures will quickly fall into the teens after sunset with an increasing northwest wind at 15 to 20 mph and frequent gusts of mph.",
        "Carrie Fisher never minced words about her bipolar disorder and her problems with drugs and alcohol. She had openly described herself as manic depressive, never shying away from talking about her fight against her mental illness. \u201cBring it on,\u201d she said in a 2000 ABC News interview with Diane Sawyer. It would seem fitting, then, that as a tribute to the iconic \u201cStar Wars\u201d princess\u2019s equally memorable wit and blunt humor, her ashes were placed in one of her most prized possessions: an urn in the shape of a giant antidepressant pill.",
        "Faline entered the Mcgaughey residence on the morning of Dec. 19, ate three cookies and then left to wander around outside. By that afternoon, she had been fatally, and purposely, shot by local authorities while her caretakers watched. Faline was a mule deer. But was she a pet, a wild animal \u2014 or something in between? That question is at the heart of a dispute between the Mcgaughey family and wildlife officials in Kansas, where they live. To the Mcgaugheys, Faline was tame but free, and she did not deserve to die.",
        "For me, the new year prompts a cleaning frenzy. No sense waiting until spring \u2014 I prefer to launch into the new calendar knowing that my house is . In addition to the areas of my home I clean regularly, such as the kitchen sink, toilets and floors, I also focus on my appliances, which typically get overlooked. By not cleaning your appliances, you are not just allowing germs to thrive, but you are also affecting the machines\u2019 performance. Here are six appliances you should clean regularly, as well as advice on how to do so and how often.",

We think you\u2019ll find something you like in this list of 10 from the Recipe Finder. Cod and Corn Chowder Pie. The fish stays moist and tender while a shower of panko adds a welcome crunch.

        "When the airline food trolley rumbles down the aisle, you can feel it happening: Your resolve starts to crumble. Your mouth starts to open and close like a guppy\u2019s. Your stomach begins to grumble the hungry demands of a teenager after wrestling practice. Salt, fat, carbs, Pringles. Charles Platkin is here to help restore your nutritional balance during domestic flights. The director of the New York City Food Policy Center at Hunter College and editor of DietDetective. com studied the edible options in coach class on a dozen carriers.",
        "Billionaire investor Carl Icahn will have the ear of Donald Trump as an adviser focused on cutting government regulations. But Icahn also stands to benefit if his advice is taken: It could make the energy companies and others in which he has a stake more profitable. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, who\u2019s a major figure in her father\u2019s business, has been present at transition meetings and is expected to continue to counsel him at the White House."
