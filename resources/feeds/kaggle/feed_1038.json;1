        "When Jim DeMint wanted to dis a TV interviewer\u2019s suggestion that Obamacare has merits as well as flaws, the former senator and tea partyer used a handy putdown: \u201cYou can put all that under the category of fake news. \u201d When conspiracy theorist Alex Jones wanted to deny a CNN report that Ivanka Trump would take over the East Wing offices traditionally occupied by the first lady, he used the same label.

I experimented with ingredients: Blueberry, Strawberry, Sour Diesel, White Widow, Bubba Kush, \u2014 all strains of cannabis, which I stored, mixed with glycerin, in meticulously labeled jars on a kitchen shelf. After the cookies finished baking, I\u2019d taste a few crumbs and annotate the effects in a notebook. Often, I felt woozy. One variation put me to sleep. When I had convinced myself that a batch was okay, I\u2019d give a cookie to my son. At the time he was consumed by violent rages.",

        "People often lament that despite their best efforts, they just cannot seem to get, and stay, organized. Even though they\u2019ve been working at it diligently and have tried many strategies, nothing seems to stick. So how do organized people stay organized? Over the years, I\u2019ve noticed they have six habits in common. Here they are: Keep it simple Elaborate organizational systems are hard to maintain and not worth the effort most of the time. It\u2019s not necessary to file folders by subject or activities on a calendar by relative. The effort far outweighs the benefits.",

Take the Reuben sandwich, the deli fixture that combines corned beef, sauerkraut, Swiss cheese and Russian dressing. Ilyse Fishman Lerner certainly grew up on the Reuben, consuming more than her fair share at the deli across the street from her high school. Now that she has her own sandwich shop, On Rye, she\u2019s paying homage to her memories with several types of Reubens. [Ready for a Reuben?",

        "Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, is a tough and wily operator. But he is opposed by an equally relentless and worthy adversary: Mitch McConnell. Nobody in recent memory has argued so frequently and so passionately against himself as the Kentucky Republican. Oyez, oyez, oyez: Let us hear the case of McConnell v. McConnell. In November, magnanimous McConnell spoke of restraint: \u201cI think it\u2019s always a mistake to misread your mandate, and frequently new majorities think it\u2019s going to be forever. . . . We\u2019ve been given a temporary lease on power, if you will. \u201d That was wise.",

The country needs to know more: The charge needs to be followed up with an independent investigation that continues after Donald Trump becomes president on Jan. 20. Congress should commit now to such a bipartisan inquiry. If there is a possibility that U. S. laws were violated by the Russian political attack, the FBI and the Justice Department should begin a formal legal investigation.

        "Donald Trump is a basket of deplorables. He is a braggart and a liar. He is a bully and a demagogue. He is an ignoramus and a deadbeat, a chiseler and either a sincere racist or an insincere one, and his love for himself is matched only by my loathing of him. He is about to be president of the United States. A constitutional coup may be in the offing. Since winning the election, Trump has not moderated his behavior.",
        "Were Donald Trump to read all the previous inaugural addresses in preparation for his big day, it would be pretty tough going from James Madison to James Buchanan. Then there was that Lincoln guy, who was really in the department. But Trump would sense a kindred spirit in Ulysses S.
