        "Where does transparency meet irresponsibility? Right at the line that BuzzFeed\u2019s editor Ben Smith approached on Tuesday and decided to step over in the name of serving citizens\u2019 best interests. With caveats and explanations aplenty, Smith published a \u201cdossier\u201d \u2014 actually just a bunch of scurrilous allegations dressed up as an intelligence report meant to damage Donald Trump. Smith said he did so because his, and BuzzFeed\u2019s preference and philosophy is, essentially, \u201cwhen in doubt, publish. \u201d But at many other news organizations, the rule is caution: \u201cWhen in doubt, leave it out.",
        "Donald J. Trump held a news conference Wednesday, his first since the November election. He was introduced by his incoming press secretary, Sean Spicer, and vice Mike Pence.

        "Donald Trump\u2019s first news conference in six months was a vintage performance. He was aggressive, combative, at times willing to offend and at times trying to sound conciliatory. What it added up to was a reminder of the challenges he will face in gaining and maintaining full public trust once he is sworn in as president. No president in memory has come to the brink of his inauguration with such a smorgasbord of potential problems and unanswered questions, or with the level of public doubts that exist around his leadership.",
        "Secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson called U. S. intelligence findings of Russian interference in the presidential election \u201ctroubling\u201d Wednesday but said he has not yet seen classified information about allegations that Russia intended to help Donald Trump. Tillerson, the former top executive at ExxonMobil, also declined to strongly denounce Russian military actions in Syria that have led to civilian deaths or to broadly condemn alleged human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia and the Philippines.",
        "The House Armed Services Committee has canceled a hearing Thursday in which retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis was to address the unconventional nature of his nomination for defense secretary, two congressional staff members said, because Donald Trump\u2019s transition team decided against him appearing. Mattis was to testify in the afternoon on his need for Congress to pass legislation that would exempt him from a law that prevents recently retired military officers from serving in senior civilian jobs in the Pentagon. The legislation states that retired military personnel must be out of uniform for seven years.",
        "Sen. Cory Booker testified Wednesday that Sen. Jeff Sessions is the wrong man to lead the Justice Department, saying the Alabama Republican\u2019s lengthy record in Congress exposed views that are inconsistent with the venerated job he is seeking. In a passionate speech from the witness table, the New Jersey Democrat ticked off issue after issue, asserting in each instance that Sessions would not seek justice as the U. S. attorney general. \u201cIf confirmed, Senator Sessions will be required to pursue justice for women, but his record indicates that he won\u2019t,\u201d Booker said.",
        "In 1999, Russia\u2019s prosecutor general \u2014 the rough equivalent of a U. S. attorney general \u2014 vowed to investigate corruption allegations involving the family of Boris Yeltsin. Then a funny thing happened. Russian TV began showing grainy video footage of the prosecutor, Yuri Skuratov, cavorting in the nude with two young women. Some observers expressed skepticism that the man in the video was actually Skuratov. But any doubts were put to rest by the head of Russia\u2019s internal security service, who declared that his agency\u2019s experts had confirmed the prosecutor\u2019s identity.",
        "At his presser today, Donald Trump confirmed the very worst fears of ethics experts, announcing a new arrangement for his business holdings that is designed to garner nice headlines but is unlikely to do much to reduce the possibility of conflicts of interest and, possibly, full blown corruption. Trump did nothing to address the central ethical problem he faces: He will not divest himself of his holdings, only transferring control of them to his two sons.",
        "Rex Tillerson, Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of state, has no government experience and has never been nominated for any government post. That was a risk the Trump team undertook when nominating him. The Trump foreign policy briefers owed Tillerson preparation that would give him the best possible chance of success. Either Tillerson stubbornly did not take that advice, or those who briefed him committed political malpractice by suggesting weaving, ducking and evading was a good way to get the critical votes he will need to succeed.",
        "BuzzFeed on Tuesday published in full a dossier of allegations regarding Donald Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia. As the site itself noted, the allegations are unverified and, in at least a couple of instances, wrong. The documents started out as opposition research commissioned first by groups, then by the other side, according to CNN. They are the product of a retired former Western intelligence official. The Erik Wemple Blog, among others, have rapped BuzzFeed for throwing the entire dossier into the light of day.",
        "In case you are just now waking up from a coma, let me tell you what happened Wednesday at Donald Trump\u2019s first press conference as . (Yes, that Donald Trump! He will be the next president!) First, he has decided that his official position on the kinds of conflicts of interest that might arise if he kept running his business while president is that If The President Does It, It Is No Conflict. Thus, any steps he takes to take his business out of his hands are from the simple, kindness of his heart.",
        "DONALD TRUMP used part of his news conference Wednesday to detail how he would separate his business dealings from his duties as president. As he pointed out several times, the pledged to do substantially more than what the law demands. But what the law demands \u2014 nothing, at least according to one interpretation \u2014 is substantially less than what he should do. Against that standard, his ethics package contains some laudable protections but falls short in two crucial ways. Drawing the right ethical lines was never going to be easy. Ethics watchdogs have insisted that Mr.",
        "CHARLESTON, S. C. \u2014 The trial began with a harrowing depiction of the massacre that unfolded in a church basement not far from here, and it ended Wednesday with relatives of those slain again offering the killer forgiveness.

        "\u201cAbsolute zero\u201d isn\u2019t just cold \u2014 it\u2019s still. It is the point at which the motion of the atoms that make up an object stops completely, when the object has no energy left to give. The rules of physics say it\u2019s impossible to cool an object to absolute zero, to remove all thermal energy until its atoms come to a standstill. But researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology are getting really close.",
        "Senate Democrats prepared Wednesday to make a show of resistance against gutting the Affordable Care Act by forcing Republicans to take politically charged votes against protecting Medicare, Medicaid and other programs. The mostly symbolic votes come amid growing concerns among congressional Republicans that the party is rushing to dismantle the ACA without a plan to replace it. Democrats planned to force the frenzied vote series called a \u201c \u201d well into Thursday morning, even as they cannot prevent the GOP from following through on their repeal plans.

        "JERUSALEM \u2014 As inauguration day draws near, U. S. allies in the Middle East, alongside Palestinian leaders and American diplomats, are warning Donald Trump to forget his campaign promise to move the U. S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. A top government minister in Jordan, Israel\u2019s neighbor, said the embassy move from Tel Aviv to the contested city of Jerusalem would have \u201ccatastrophic consequences,\u201d inflaming religious passions and rallying extremists in the region. The Palestinians have also called the move \u201ca red line\u201d that would dash hopes for a solution to their conflict with the Israelis.",
        "Federal prosecutors indicted six executives at German automaker Volkswagen on Wednesday in connection with the company\u2019s diesel emissions scandal. Five of the six executives are thought to be residing in Germany, according to the Department of Justice. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said it was too soon to say how that will impact legal proceedings moving forward. The sixth executive was arrested at an airport in Miami over the weekend as he was trying to leave for Germany. Additional executives at the company are being investigated and could potentially face charges, Lynch said.",
        "For years, companies like Facebook and Google have captivated audiences with the prospect of someday beaming Internet access down to earth from drones or satellites flying high above the ground. The dream held particular promise for developing countries where it\u2019s often expensive to build cellular towers or lay down physical Internet cabling. Now, though, Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, is scaling back its ambitions for Internet by drone. It has disbanded the team that had been developing the technology, according to the company. Dozens of employees in the group, known as Titan, have been reassigned to work on other projects.",

        "A deer carcass lies in the back of a truck in a forest outside Oi. (Thomas ) Japan is not known for its gender equality. From geishas to Harajuku Girls, Japanese women have been battling gender stereotypes and sexism for centuries. The latest Global Gender Gap Report from the World Economic Forum put Japan at 111th of 144 countries, 10 places lower than last year. In Japan, the report stated, there is a \u201csignificant widening of the gender gap for professional and technical workers, adversely affecting its ranking.",
        "The Justice Department inspector general will review broad allegations of misconduct involving FBI Director James B. Comey and how he handled the probe of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email practices, the inspector general announced Thursday. The investigation will be wide ranging \u2014 encompassing Comey\u2019s various letters and public statements on the matter and whether FBI or other Justice Department employees leaked nonpublic information, according to Inspector General Michael E.

        "Retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be the next U. S. defense secretary, placed Russia first among principal threats facing the United States, arguing for greater American support for European allies to counter what he said were Moscow\u2019s attempts to shatter the North Atlantic security alliance. Mattis, a respected combat leader who made his name in the wars following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, cautioned that sustained cuts to military budgets and personnel meant the U. S. military is no longer strong enough to easily outmatch Russia and other adversaries.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for CIA director vowed Thursday to defy his boss if asked to commit future acts of torture against suspected terrorists, telling a Senate panel, \u201cI will always comply with the law. \u201d The promise by Rep. Mike Pompeo ( .) came during a confirmation hearing that saw the nominee veer sharply from policy positions embraced by the man who chose him for the job.

        "Ben Carson on Thursday detailed his vision for the Department of Housing and Urban Development: one that integrates government assistance programs with \u201cholistic\u201d solutions and greater involvement of businesses and faith groups. Carson, speaking before a generally friendly Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, repeatedly suggested that the private sector should play a larger role in addressing poverty and systemic inequities, investing in \u201chuman capital\u201d as a means of increasing quality of life and profits. \u201cThe programs that have been enacted in HUD over the years, you know, they\u2019re good programs,\u201d Carson said.",
        "Secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson faced several questions on Wednesday about his tenure as chief executive of ExxonMobil \u2014 and several times, Tillerson said that he couldn\u2019t recall certain details of his four decades of work. Moreover, while Tillerson repeatedly described sanctions as a powerful tool when compliance is broad, Democrats tried to show that ExxonMobil had done business with sanctioned state sponsors of terrorism including Iran, Syria and Sudan. On Thursday, the company asserted that its transactions with those countries were modest in size and did not violate sanctions law. [Tillerson calls U. S.",
        "President Obama awarded the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to a shocked Vice President Biden on Thursday at the White House.
