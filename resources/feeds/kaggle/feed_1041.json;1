        "This is very late in coming, but, hey, better late than never: The Justice Department inspector general will review broad allegations of misconduct involving the FBI\u2019s investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email practices and the bureau\u2019s controversial decision shortly before the election to announce the probe had resumed, the inspector general announced Thursday. The probe will be wide ranging \u2014 encompassing the FBI\u2019s various public statements on the matter, whether its deputy director should have been recused and whether FBI or other Justice Department employees leaked nonpublic information, according to a news release from Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz.",
        "Dana Goward is president of the Resilient Navigation and Timing Foundation. This week\u2019s confirmation hearings for homeland security secretary and transportation secretary were notable for something not discussed: the fact that the two departments have failed for 12 years to comply with presidential orders to eliminate one of the most serious threats to the security and economy of the United States. America\u2019s Global Positioning System is a technological miracle and our gift to the world.",
        "Donald Trump has been blessed with two tall and healthy adult sons who have slain numerous wild beasts using only sticks that spit fire. They are married to human women, and their hair is sleek and glossy like the back of a marmot. They possess the right number of teeth. Donald Trump loves to speak to them and give them his counsel, and the one great tragedy of his upcoming presidency is that he will no longer be able to talk business with them. How can he?",
        "Secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson did not have a great Wednesday on Capitol Hill. The former ExxonMobil chief struggled to answer the question on whether the oil giant had ever lobbied against sanctions on Russia while he was CEO. He stumbled on whether Saudi Arabia is a human rights violator, something even the U. S. government \u2014 too often willing to look the other way when it comes to the House of Saud \u2014 accepts. And he admitted the astonishing fact that he had not yet talked in specifics about Russia policy with Donald Trump.",
        "There\u2019s a joke among Asian Americans that people think we all look the same. That joke became my own personal Pizzagate late Wednesday: I got caught in a terrible case of mistaken identity that was exacerbated by the speed at which false information spreads on social media. I work as a homepage editor at The Washington Post. Because Wednesday was my day off, I hadn\u2019t been online much. But before I went to bed, I noticed a message request on Facebook.",
        "President Obama declared five new national monuments Thursday ranging from a Birmingham, Ala. church bombed by segregationists to the coniferous forests of Oregon. He has now used his executive authority more than any other president in history to protect iconic historic, cultural and ecological sites across the country. The three new monuments in the South, all of which enjoy bipartisan support, exemplify Obama\u2019s push to expand America\u2019s shared national identity through the narrative it tells with its public lands. Two of the sites, in Birmingham and Anniston, Ala.",
        "The Environmental Protection Agency accused Fiat Chrysler on Thursday of installing software that enables certain diesel trucks to emit far more pollutants than emissions laws allow. The company denied those accusations, saying its software meets regulatory requirements. The vehicles involved were the 2014 to 2016 model year Dodge Ram 1500 pickup trucks and Jeep Grand Cherokees with 3. diesel engines. The allegations affect roughly 104, 000 vehicles, EPA officials said. Janet McCabe, head of EPA\u2019s Office of Air and Radiation, said \u201cno immediate actions are necessary\u201d for owners because their vehicles are still safe and legal to drive.",
        "One body was recovered from the scene of a Baltimore house fire Thursday in which six of nine young children in a family are presumed by authorities to have died. A woman and three other children escaped the midnight blaze and were hospitalized as of midday Thursday, fire officials said. The children range in age from 11 to old and include twin girls, officials said. The collapse of floors and burning debris at the home in Northeast Baltimore made it difficult for firefighters to fight the fire and search the site, Baltimore City Fire Chief Roman Clark said.",
        "Early Tuesday morning, Anna Brittain got a text from her sister: Did she know about Familytreenow. com? The relatively unknown site, which presents itself as a free genealogy resource, seemed to know an awful lot about her. \u201cThe site listed my and as \u2018possible associates,\u2019 \u201d Brittain, a fiction writer in Birmingham, Ala. told The Washington Post on Tuesday. Her sister, a social worker who works at a child advocacy center, found the site while doing a regular Internet footprint checkup on herself.",

Dean Spanos, the chairman of the San Diego Chargers, announced publicly what he\u2019d told NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and some fellow owners a day earlier: that he is moving his franchise to L. A. to join the Rams, who relocated there from St. Louis last year. Now comes the arduous task of trying to make it work.",

Bezos has bought the former Textile Museum, a 27, 000 property, intending to convert it into a home, according to a person with knowledge of the sale. Bezos\u2019s neighbors will include President Obama and his family, who are renting a property nearby for their House home as well as future first daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, incoming presidential adviser Jared Kushner.",
        "At once confounding and captivating, HBO\u2019s new limited series \u201cThe Young Pope\u201d (premiering Sunday) is among the strangest and most unsettling shows I\u2019ve reviewed in several years \u2014 the morose story of an American cardinal, Lenny Belardo (Jude Law) who is chosen to be the next pope, even though he\u2019s only in his 40s.",
        "When I was 13, in 1981, I immigrated to the United States with my parents and sister from Peru. Since that time the D. C. area has been my home. In many ways, I\u2019ve lived a hybrid life based on values, traditions and experiences of two countries, which is nothing unusual for immigrants. But as I\u2019ve gotten older, and the reality that I have lived in Washington for about of my life has set in, I have become more nostalgic for Peru \u2014 family, food, friends, traditions.",
        "Attorney General Loretta Lynch will step down without the Justice Department having charged or cleared police officers in the death of Eric Garner, whose videotaped takedown by New York City officers sparked national outrage, people familiar with the matter said. Lynch authorized the department to move forward with the case, but made that decision so late in her tenure that lawyers and investigators could not take all the necessary steps to procure an indictment.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to divest from his global business empire has provoked a showdown in Washington over government ethics, pitting a small federal agency tasked with preventing conflicts of interest against the incoming administration and its Republican allies on Capitol Hill. The dispute erupted Friday after a top House Republican demanded to question the director of the independent Office of Government Ethics, who took the unusual step this week of denouncing Trump for retaining ownership of his businesses while transferring management to his sons.",
        "Russia has invited the incoming Trump administration to Syrian peace talks it is sponsoring later this month with Turkey and Iran, part of a process from which the Obama administration pointedly has been excluded. U. S. participation, especially if an agreement is reached, would be the first indication of the enhanced U. S. cooperation that President Vladi mir Putin and Donald Trump have forecast under a Trump administration. The invitation, extended to Trump\u2019s designated national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, came in a Dec.",
        "William Peter Blatty, an author whose novel \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d and his later screenplay for the 1973 film about a demonic possession became a phenomenon and stirred fierce public debate about the occult, died Jan. 12 at a hospital near his home in Bethesda, Md.

        "Congress took its first step toward rolling back President Obama\u2019s reform law Friday, with the House voting along party lines to pass a crucial precursor to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s unraveling. It will now only get harder for Republicans.

        "Watching Donald Trump\u2019s news conference this week, thinking back over his foul, nasty campaign, an election stained with slurs, serial insults, black voter suppression and an outcome influenced by Russia, and looking ahead with dread to his Friday as president of the United States of America, a small, quiet voice within asks: \u201cDear God, are we being punished?\u201d It has certainly happened before.

        "We now have not one but two \u201csecret\u201d dossiers on the Russian campaign to support Donald Trump. One of them is an unverified and probably unverifiable collection of rumors and gossip put together by a former British spy. Dumped on the Internet by BuzzFeed, the report is filled with small mistakes and some puzzles (for instance: how could salacious Russian \u201c kompromat\u201d or compromising material, be used to blackmail someone as shameless as Trump?) and mixes the plausible with the implausible without giving real answers.",
        "IT HAS been widely observed that Donald Trump\u2019s national security nominees differed with his campaign positions during their confirmation hearings on a range of issues, from the threat of Russia and importance of NATO to the value of building a wall along the border with Mexico.

        "A federal investigation into the Chicago police found that the department routinely uses excessive force and violates the constitutional rights of residents, particularly those who are black and Latino. The blistering report by the Justice Department, released Friday, put an unwelcome spotlight on Chicago, a city already struggling with a surge in gun violence that has pushed homicide numbers to their highest level in two decades. The report, and a pledge by city officials to reform the police department, come in the last days of the Obama administration, which has aggressively pursued investigations of abuse by local law enforcement.",

        "Federal prosecutors brought criminal charges against three Takata executives and fined the Japanese maker $1 billion on Friday for concealing information about faulty air bags, leading to the deaths of several motorists and prompting the largest safety recall in U.

        "Anger over the Obama administration\u2019s actions toward Israel has triggered a nasty fight at a predominantly Jewish country club in the Washington suburbs over whether to offer a membership to the president after he leaves office.
