        "Amy Neiwirth is a artist who makes tiny clay models of popular foods: pizzas, cakes, waffles, even retro TV dinners. But Neiwirth, 35, doesn\u2019t eat any of those foods herself \u2014 not the conventional versions, anyway. She\u2019s one of the 3. 1 million Americans who follows a diet, even though she tested negative for celiac disease. Such people are called \u201cPWAGs,\u201d in the medical jargon: \u201cpeople without celiac disease avoiding gluten. \u201d They\u2019re often stigmatized as faddish foodies or hypochondriacs who don\u2019t understand the science behind a serious health problem.",
        "There was an angle I didn\u2019t get to see when ordering my new work boots \u2026 A Southern California shoe company has recalled a model of work boots after a customer complained that the tread leaves swastika stamps on the ground. The faux pas was brought to the attention of Conal International Trading Inc. the City of Industry company that manufactures the boots, after a Redditor posted a picture on Imgur showing the footwear alongside its swastika imprints. \u201cThere was an angle I didn\u2019t get to see when ordering my new work boots,\u201d the caption read.",
        "Frida Kahlo, known to for her paintings, was also no stranger to the camera. She was one of the most photographed women of her generation, emanating her sensuality, personal fashion, and unique beauty. Her father was photographer Guillermo Kahlo and through sitting for portraits she learned the power of the medium. Kahlo stated: \u201cWhen my father took my picture in 1932 after my accident, I knew that a battlefield of suffering was in my eyes. From then on, I started looking straight at the lens, unflinching, unsmiling, determined to show that I was a good fighter to the end.",
        "Running for president, Donald Trump promised an immediate revolution \u2014 to quickly rebuild America\u2019s cities, overhaul the tax code and deport millions of illegal immigrants. Just this week, Trump vowed to get started right away on building a wall along the border with Mexico (\u201cI don\u2019t want to wait\u201d) and repealing and replacing President Obama\u2019s law (\u201cprobably the same day, could be the same hour\u201d). But ahead of his on Friday, the extraordinarily high expectations that Trump has set have been running into the logjam known as American democracy.",
        "In Donald Trump\u2019s final days on the campaign trail, he promised his supporters that \u201cevery dream you ever dreamed for your country\u201d will come true if he becomes president \u2014 one of dozens of sweeping promises he made and is now expected to fulfill. In January, I compiled a list of 76 campaign promises Trump had made. Since then, the list has grown to 282, collected from Trump\u2019s speeches, public comments, tweets and campaign and transition websites. JOBS 1. Create at least 25 million jobs and \u201cbe the greatest jobs president that God ever created.",
        "In the countdown to Inauguration Day, the guessing game over the presidency of Donald Trump continues. But there is one reality about the man who will become the 45th president on Friday. The Trump presidency will be a mold breaker. The question is whether he can run a successful presidency the same way he ran his campaign. In almost all ways, the is breaking the conventions of presidential style. Given what happened in the campaign, this should hardly be a surprise, for Trump didn\u2019t win the election by promising to continue past practices.",
        "President Obama is not going quietly into his . He has said he plans to stay out of the political scrum, find some \u201cquiet\u201d and write a book when his second term ends Friday. For the moment, though, he is staying in the media spotlight with speeches, interviews and a news conference planned for Wednesday. And Obama has used the flurry of appearances to stake out a legacy imperiled by the surprising victory of Donald Trump. He has also offered Trump some advice when it comes to tweeting.",
        "CA MAU, Vietnam \u2014 It could have been 1969 again as Secretary of State John F. Kerry stood on the bow of the small boat chugging up the Bay Hap River on Saturday, the wind billowing his sleeves and his eyes darting left and right toward banks shrouded in dark foliage. As a young Navy lieutenant, Kerry commanded a Swift boat along this stretch of churning brown waters in the middle of a zone.",
        "A public feud between Donald Trump and Rep. John Lewis ( .) seemed to jettison any lingering hopes that the inauguration would temporarily ease partisanship in Washington and instead threatened to widen the rift between the two parties. Lewis\u2019s assertion that Trump is not a \u201clegitimate president\u201d and his announcement that he would skip Friday\u2019s inaugural ceremony prompted the to sharply criticize the civil rights leader Saturday morning.",
        "Michael R. Bromwich served as Justice Department inspector general from 1994 to 1999. The announcement by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general that his office will look into FBI Director James B. Comey\u2019s handling of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails reopens painful questions about the 2016 election, but it is also welcome news.

        "Prosper was U. S. for war crimes issues from 2001 to 2005 and a prosecutor at the U. N. International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. John B. Bellinger III served as the legal adviser at the State Department from 2005 to 2009. Sen. Marco Rubio ( .) is right to wonder whether Vladimir Putin is a war criminal. And when he put that question to Secretary of Rex Tillerson this week, Tillerson was right to reserve judgment on the issue. Here\u2019s why.",

        "The 2016 presidential election and Donald Trump have given Russia a wonderful opportunity to showcase one of its best national products: a particularly effective type of media manipulation called \u201ckompromat. \u201d Short for \u201ccompromising material\u201d in Russian, kompromat is all about the intersection of news and blackmail. It\u2019s the ability to sully the reputations of political opponents or pressure allies through hints, images, videos, promises of disclosures, perhaps even some faked documentation. Sex or pornography often figures prominently. The beauty of kompromat is that it has to create only a sense of doubt, not prove its case conclusively.",
        "Many of us are familiar with the traditions of Inauguration Day: the meeting of the incoming and outgoing presidents at the White House, the procession to the Capitol, the oath, the address, the parade, the balls. While everything that takes place on Inauguration Day might seem like clockwork, a closer look reveals that our presidential inaugurations have varied over the years \u2014 and this year may be different yet. With the festivities almost underway, it\u2019s worth examining a few widely shared misconceptions about inaugurations. Myth No. 1 Presidential handoffs are amicable.",
        "Two major retail companies dropped bombshells four days into 2017. After posting disappointing holiday sales, Macy\u2019s released a list of 68 stores it will close by . Sears followed suit by announcing that 42 stores would be shutting down within the year. More than 10, 000 jobs will be cut at Macy\u2019s alone, but the consequences will reverberate beyond the walls of shuttered department stores. Many Macy\u2019s and Sears locations are attached to shopping centers as anchor stores \u2014 and when an anchor sinks, it drags down the smaller businesses that depend on the steady foot traffic it draws.",
        "Pinned to the ground by officers who kneed and struck him, Lawrence Crosby screamed whatever he could think of to convince them that he was a PhD student, not a violent car thief. \u201cThis is my vehicle, sir,\u201d he said, his voice captured by the video. \u201cI have evidence. . . . I purchased this vehicle Jan. 23, 2015, from Libertyville Chevrolet. \u201d It wasn\u2019t enough.

        "ANCHORAGE \u2014 Monday night was lasagna night inside the storefront of VFW Post 9981. Clemson was still behind Alabama on the big screens as regulars trickled in. At the bar, Joe Federmann considered how Esteban Santiago fell through the social safety net Alaska has for veterans.

        "RAMALLAH, West Bank \u2014 Poor, belittled Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has pulled off a remarkable feat. On Sunday, top diplomats from as many as 70 nations are gathering in Paris to show their support for the creation of a Palestinian state. Abbas hasn\u2019t won his people a sovereign nation. Not even close. But with all the challenges facing the world, the international community has accepted the invitation of French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande to come together again and urge Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hammer out a solution to the conflict.",
        "MOSUL, Iraq \u2014 It was the dead of night when Iraqi commandos advanced into the neighborhood deep in eastern Mosul. Dozens of the soldiers waded across a small river that separated them from Islamic State positions. Night vision goggles cast the terrain in front of them in a greenglow. On the other side, they fought house to house, helping the engineering teams make space for the main attack force. The Humvees then rolled through.",

        "Earlier this week, Broadway legend Jennifer Holliday agreed to perform at a welcome concert for Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. And then, in droves, her fans begged her not to.

        "Last week, a tradition of modern presidential inaugurations brought unwanted attention to the St. Louis Art Museum. Since Ronald Reagan\u2019s second inauguration in 1985, an American painting has served as a backdrop during the inaugural luncheon, at which members of Congress play host to the newly installed president. When Donald Trump is made the 45th president of the United States on Jan. 20, George Caleb Bingham\u2019s \u201cThe Verdict of the People\u201d will be the chosen painting, hanging on a partition wall behind the ceremonial head table in the Capitol\u2019s Statuary Hall.",

        "Interviews by Debra Bruno Sometime during their date, Natalie Weiner, 28, a legislative associate with a nonprofit, and Daniel Lebiednik, 29, a nonprofit consultant, made a pact to keep certain parts of their conversation off the record \u2014 possibly making this the most Washington blind date ever. The two also matched up on a penchant for sarcasm and social justice. We sent them to Mission in Dupont Circle. They seemed to have a pleasant, if not exactly rollicking, good time. But who knows?

        "I don\u2019t like looking at the three bins in my basement that are overflowing with old electronics, much less touching them. So let me make one thing clear: Do as I say, not as I do. Make a plan to sell, donate or recycle your old electronics now. Consumer Reports points out that electronics don\u2019t age well. If you want to get some money out of them, the younger the better. machines can be donated, but ancient ones should be recycled.",
        "The eruption of hostilities between Donald Trump and Rep. John Lewis ( .) a civil rights icon, may be recorded as just one more example of what has become standard Twitter retaliation for Trump.
