        "In the coming days, Sally Berk will be able to say that she lives in the same Northwest Washington neighborhood as Barack and Michelle, Jared and Ivanka, and a billionaire named Jeff. . What\u2019s another president in the \u2019hood when five others have already resided in Kalorama, Washington\u2019s very own version of Beverly Hills? Can you blame the first daughter for wanting to live a glide path to her father at the White House? And where else can a tech magnate find a crash pad just 1. 8 miles from his new media company?",
        "Who is John Lewis that Donald Trump should be mindful of him? Lewis, by one definition, is a liberal politician with a disturbing habit of hyperbole. He questioned the validity of George W. Bush\u2019s presidential win. He once compared John McCain to George Wallace. Now he questions the legitimacy of Trump\u2019s presidential victory. By another definition, Lewis was a consequential student leader of the civil rights movement.",
        "PARIS \u2014 Diplomats from more than 70 countries called Sunday for the creation of a sovereign Palestinian state and urged Israel and Palestinians to restart direct negotiations. In their joint declaration at the conclusion of a Mideast conference here, the envoys urged Israel and the Palestinians to restate their commitment to the goal of two states living side by side in peace and security. The representatives, including Secretary of State John F. Kerry, also warned that continued acts of violence and the building of Jewish settlements in the West Bank needed to stop.",
        "At the northeast corner of the National Archives building sits Robert Aitken\u2019s sculpture \u201cThe Future,\u201d inscribed with some famous words from Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cThe Tempest\u201d: \u201cWhat is past is prologue. \u201d If you buy that, it\u2019s possible to have a solid idea of what Donald Trump\u2019s presidency will be like for the American media and for citizens who depend on that flawed but essential institution. The short form: hellish. Consider, for example, the saga of Serge Kovaleski, the highly regarded New York Times reporter whose disability limits the use of his arms.",
        "They are three women who have spent months getting an experimental vaccine in the name of science. On each date of a strict timetable, they\u2019ve headed to windowless exam rooms in Bethesda, Md. Baltimore and Atlanta and stuck out their arms, to get an injection or to have blood drawn. Or both. How their bodies react will determine whether this clinical trial \u2014 one of the first \u2014 proceeds to the next stage in a long and complicated process.",
        "A former Texas teacher who was impregnated by a student has been sentenced to 10 years in prison. Alexandria Vera, 25, was facing up to 30 years behind bars after pleading guilty to aggravated sexual assault of a child in November. She admitted to police that a relationship that started with Instagram messages between her and the boy blossomed into a romance \u2014 one that the boy\u2019s family approved of.",
        "Security measures related to Friday\u2019s presidential inauguration are already visible, in the form of Jersey barriers placed on the streets near Lafayette Square. Parking restrictions will begin Wednesday. Streets will start closing Thursday. By week\u2019s end, the nation\u2019s capital will have transformed into a virtual fortress of roadblocks, fences and armed police. Streets will be barricaded with trucks filled with sand. Five Metro stations will close Friday. Crossing Pennsylvania Avenue will be next to impossible.",
        "The transition team for Donald Trump asked the head of the D. C. National Guard to remain in command throughout Inauguration Day after media reports that he would leave in the middle of the ceremony created controversy, the Guard said. Maj. Gen. Errol R. Schwartz told The Washington Post on Friday that he will be removed from his post immediately after Trump is sworn in as president. That irked at least one D. C.",
        "When Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus announced late Saturday that it would permanently end all of its performances this May after a run, there seemed to be a collective gasp online, along with a smattering of nostalgia for \u201cThe Greatest Show on Earth. \u201d The show has been, after all, nearly synonymous with \u201cthe circus\u201d in the United States since the 1800s, when showman Phineas Taylor Barnum partnered with ringmaster James A. Bailey to produce an exhibition of animals and human oddities.",
        "After a girl\u2019s death was broadcast on social media, police could do little to keep the disturbing footage from spreading online. The video immediately appeared on various sites, including Facebook and YouTube, both of which have since made efforts to remove the footage. YouTube took the video down, saying it violated the website\u2019s policy on violent or graphic content. But, according to media reports, the video lingered on Facebook for nearly two weeks before the social media giant started removing versions of the footage from its pages.",
        "The first hint of trouble came just a week after I had knee replacement surgery. I was rearranging the bedclothes over my new knee when I realized the down comforter felt like lead, and lifting it felt like doing a bench press. That seemed curious, but I was so bent on getting the new knee to work properly that I ignored my sore arms as well as a stubborn stiffness in my neck and hips. Physical therapy was my focus, and the goal was to get back to my favorite pastime \u2014 rowing.",
        "I\u2019m 39, single, easy on the eyes, easy to get along with and good in bed. And I can\u2019t get laid. How is that possible? Well, for starters, despite the fact that I use words like \u201claid\u201d and reject the conventional wisdom that says female sexuality is best muted and monitored, I believe sex is metaphysical and elemental. An exchange of energies and all that. Which means casual sex in the Tinder sense doesn\u2019t work for me. I have no desire to see disappointment on my gynecologist\u2019s face when my Pap comes back abnormal. I want a lover.",
        "It\u2019s time to leave your ordinary office supplies behind and upgrade your desktop for 2017. We asked Tobe Reed, the personality behind the design blog Because It\u2019s Awesome, to recommend some fun \u2014 and functional \u2014 desk accessories.

        "It\u2019s winter: We\u2019ve nested inside, we\u2019re ready for stews and braises, but we\u2019re still strapped to that infernal invention, the clock. There are rarely enough minutes, at least not when we want them. That\u2019s why some of us cooks want comfort food fast from the latest countertop pressure cooker; some depend on the convenience of a slow cooker; and some prefer the Dutch oven, which requires a bit of finesse.",
        "They are some of the biggest names in the Republican national security firmament, veterans of past GOP administrations who say, if called upon by Donald Trump, they stand ready to serve their country again. But their phones aren\u2019t ringing. Their entreaties to Trump Tower in New York have mostly gone unanswered. In Trump world, these establishment say they are \u201cPNG\u201d \u2014 personae non gratae. Their transgression was signing one or both of two public \u201cNever Trump\u201d letters during the campaign, declaring they would not vote for Trump and calling his candidacy a danger to the nation.",
        "BRUSSELS \u2014 European leaders grappled with the jolting reality of Donald Trump\u2019s skepticism of the European Union on Monday, saying they might have to stand without the United States at their side during the Trump presidency. The possibility of an unprecedented breach in transatlantic relations came after Trump \u2014 who embraced . U. insurgents during his campaign and following his victory \u2014 said in weekend remarks that the European Union was bound for a breakup and that he was indifferent to its fate. He also said NATO\u2019s current configuration is \u201cobsolete,\u201d even as he professed commitment to Europe\u2019s defense.",
        "Donald Trump threatened German automakers with a hefty import tax if they plan to sell cars in the United States that were built in other countries, repeating a claim that has shaken the global automotive industry and its biggest players at home and abroad.

        "President Obama\u2019s first inaugural festivities stretched over five days. Donald Trump is spending barely three on his. Bill Clinton hit 14 official balls on the day he was sworn in. Trump plans appearances at three. And while other presidents have staged parades that lasted more than four hours, Trump\u2019s trip down Pennsylvania Avenue is expected to clock in at 90 minutes \u2014 making it among the shortest on record.",
        "The last Martin Luther King Jr. Day before America\u2019s first black president handed power over to Donald Trump was always going to be awkward. Rep. John Lewis ( .) determined just how awkward it would be when he told Chuck Todd of \u201dMeet the Press\u201d that he did not see Trump as a \u201dlegitimate president.\u201d No one needs a refresher on how Donald Trump responded, with an insult to the city of Atlanta, but some might have missed the pushback in mainstream and conservative media.",
        "A growing group of Democratic lawmakers will boycott Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration Friday as a protest of Trump\u2019s worldview and his criticism of civil rights icon John Lewis, congressman of Georgia. There are now more than 30 House Democrats \u2014 35, at last count \u2014 who have declared that they will not attend the inauguration on Capitol Hill this week. The number rose sharply after Trump tweeted Saturday that Lewis is \u201call talk, talk, talk\u201d and should \u201cfinally focus on the burning and crime infested . \u201d Lewis, who sees Trump\u2019s Nov.",
        "Justice Department officials have completed their review of more than 16, 000 clemency petitions filed by federal prisoners over the past two years and sent their last recommendations to President Obama, who is set to grant hundreds more commutations to nonviolent drug offenders during his final days in office. \u201cEveryone has killed themselves here to get the final recommendations to the president,\u201d Deputy Attorney General Sally Q.

        "Rep. John Lewis is the son of sharecroppers. As a child, he wanted to be a preacher; he practiced by delivering fiery sermons to the family\u2019s chickens. But history had other plans for him: lunch counter Freedom Rides, the March on Washington, the Edmund Pettus Bridge, a seat in Congress representing most of Atlanta. No sane person would accuse such a man of being \u201call talk, talk, talk \u2014 no action or results. \u201d But that is precisely what Donald Trump said of Lewis.",
        "Kellyanne Conway is walking a Dangerfield line. \u201cWe got no forbearance. We got nothing. We got no respect,\u201d the Trump strategist told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper last week, complaining about media coverage of her boss. \u201cThis man is president of the United States!\u201d Conway raises a fair question: Why hasn\u2019t the been given more respect? Here\u2019s a fair answer: He hasn\u2019t earned any. To Trump\u2019s many superlatives, he can now add another: the sorest winner.",
        "Whether he knows it or not, the specter of Lyndon Baines Johnson haunts Donald John Trump. There are some jarring similarities \u2014 two big, fleshy men given to vulgarities and gauche behavior, boastful, politically amoral, vengeful, unforgiving and, most important, considered illegitimate presidents. For Johnson, that took some time to sink in; Trump is already there. Johnson ascended to the presidency upon the death of John F. Kennedy and then won election in a landslide over Barry Goldwater. Nevertheless, an air of illegitimacy clung to him like an odor.",
        "Richard Painter, a professor of law at the University of Minnesota, was the chief White House ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007 and is vice chair of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Norman Eisen, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, was the chief White House ethics lawyer from 2009 to 2011 and is the chair of CREW.

        "If you\u2019re worried about climate change, it\u2019s scary to think that the incoming Trump administration could reverse gains made in recent years. But a recent conversation with departing Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz convinced me that the progress is probably irreversible. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that we are moving to a economy,\u201d Moniz said in an interview in his Washington office. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is largely a phenomenon. . . .

        "ABOUT HALF of all suicides in prisons across the country take place among the 5 or 6 percent of prisoners held in solitary confinement, a measure of the devastating toll exacted by isolating inmates, often for 22 hours a day, from social interactions \u2014 and often from basic health and other services.
