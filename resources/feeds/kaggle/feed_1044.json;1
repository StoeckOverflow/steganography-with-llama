        "On a superficial level, what went down Monday at the White House was a ceremony honoring another professional sports champion at the seat of American power. The president made some remarks. The team gave him a personalized jersey. They all smiled for the cameras. The players departed and tweeted from the bus on their way to the airport about how cool an experience it was. But circumstances being what they were, and the times being what they are, this was no normal ceremony.",
        "HOUSTON \u2014 Former astronaut Gene Cernan, the last person to walk on the moon who returned to Earth with a message of \u201cpeace and hope for all mankind,\u201d died on Monday in Texas following ongoing heath issues, his family said. He was 82. Cernan was with his relatives when he died at a Houston hospital, family spokeswoman Melissa Wren told The Associated Press. His family said his devotion to lunar exploration never waned.",
        "The fiercest critics and most ardent supporters of President Obama\u2019s Education Department \u2014 which has arguably wielded more influence and sparked more controversy than any of its recent predecessors \u2014 generally agree that the agency\u2019s efforts were rooted in the faith that government has a critical role to play in improving people\u2019s lives. Now the department is poised for a radical shift with the arrival of Donald Trump in Washington; the businessman, now has often spoken about government as a bumbling failure and an impediment to success. Education Secretary John B. King Jr.",
        "As Michelle Obama prepares to leave the White House, she\u2019s been talking publicly about how eager she is to return to normal life. \u201cI want to open my front door without discussing it with anyone \u2014 and just walk,\u201d she told Oprah Winfrey in an interview last year. She has also said she wants to sit in a yard, stroll through a store and open a window in her house, all things she has not been able to do for eight years.",
        "It was \u201cone of the longest and most exhaustive investigations\u201d in FBI history \u2014 and to this day remains the only unsolved skyjacking in the United States. In 1971, a passenger hijacked a Northwest Orient flight, demanded $200, 000 and later escaped by parachuting out of the back of the plane with the ransom money. But who exactly was \u201cD. B. Cooper,\u201d the mysterious man who managed to pull off the heist and disappear without a trace?",
        "This post has been updated. The Shaw Bijou closed Sunday after only 2\u00bd months, and the owner says all the principals share the blame for the short run. Kelly Gorsuch, the principal owner of Shaw Bijou, says he saw himself as a silent investor, providing the capital for chef Kwame Onwuachi and general manager Greg Vakiner to build and run the restaurant they had been planning for years. But in retrospect, Gorsuch says he should have pushed the duo more from the start. He says that the restaurant\u2019s pricey dinner wasn\u2019t filling seats or covering costs.",
        "After days of controversy over the impending ouster of the Army general who heads the D. C. National Guard, the man slated to succeed him insisted Monday that the incident would not undermine Inauguration Day security. Maj. Gen. Errol R. Schwartz told The Washington Post last Friday that he would be pulled from his post at 12:01 p. m. Friday \u2014 immediately after Donald Trump is sworn in as president. The Guard plays an essential role in ensuring that the transition of power unfolds safely, and many people, including the D. C.",
        "A cover band is the latest musical act to cancel its scheduled inauguration weekend performance. The Bruce Springsteen cover band Band, which performed at the two previous New Jersey state inauguration galas, is backing out of its 2017 gig out of deference to The Boss. \u201cWe felt that we had to make it known that we didn\u2019t want to seem disrespectful, in any way, shape or form, to Bruce and his music and his band,\u201d bandleader Will Forte told Rolling Stone. \u201cI don\u2019t want to upset them.",
        "Not all the who stumped for Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders will be hiding under their sheets this week. On Thursday, the day before Donald Trump is sworn in on the steps of the Capitol Building in the District, a group of celebrities and Mayor Bill de Blasio will gather in New York City to protest the future commander in chief on his home turf. Chief \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d Trump impersonator Alec Baldwin, actors Mark Ruffalo and Rosie Perez, the Rev.",
        "President Obama commuted the prison sentence of Chelsea Manning, an Army private convicted in 2013 of taking troves of secret diplomatic and military documents and disclosing them to WikiLeaks. Obama also granted a full and complete pardon to Ret. Marine General James E. Cartwright for lying to the FBI in a probe of a leak of classified information about a covert U.

        "At least 18 million people would lose health insurance in the first year if Republicans move ahead with plans to repeal major portions of the Affordable Care Act without a replacement plan, estimates a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The number of people without insurance would grow to about 32 million within the first decade if congressional Republicans follow a 2015 plan to repeal the law without an alternative, the new report says.",
        "Donald Trump has long flirted with an adversarial relationship with our country\u2019s intelligence community. And now he apparently has gone too far for at least one of its leaders. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published Monday night, CIA Director John O. Brennan had finally had it. Brennan said Trump crossed \u201cthe line\u201d by invoking Nazi Germany while talking about the intelligence community having, in Trump\u2019s words, \u201callowed\u201d a dossier full of unconfirmed and salacious allegations about him to leak into the public domain.",
        "In the opening moments of a confirmation hearing for Betsy DeVos, Donald Trump\u2019s pick for education secretary, a leading Republican declared that DeVos would do an excellent job, while the leading Democrat voiced \u201cmajor concerns\u201d about her fitness to lead the nation\u2019s public schools. It was the latest sign that DeVos, a Michigan billionaire, faces an unusual amount of backlash for a prospective education secretary.",
        "Exactly one week after becoming Donald Trump stepped outside his namesake fortress here for the first time. He ventured just five blocks, to dinner at the 21 Club \u2014 a throwback, where model airplanes and sports memorabilia hang from the ceiling and jackets are de rigueur for men. The vintage haunt, where Trump dined with family members, feels like home. The waiters know his preferred table (No. 14, which Frank Sinatra and Richard M. Nixon also used) and his regular order (the $36 burger, well done, with fries).",
        "A former contestant on the reality show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d filed a defamation lawsuit Tuesday against Donald Trump over his response to her allegations that he groped her during a job interview in 2007. Summer Zervos, a California restaurant owner who appeared on the show in 2006, accused Trump of aggressively kissing and grabbing her when she went to his bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel to discuss a possible job at the Trump Organization a year later.",
        "And so the Boy President heads for Washington to be sworn into office, pumping his fist, mooning the media, giving the stinky finger to whomever irks him, doing his dance, promising to build the wall, cut taxes, create jobs, provide great health insurance for EVERYONE and send his to the Middle East to solve that little problem, and the rest of us will sit in a barn and keep ourselves warm and hide our heads under our wings, poor things. Discouraging. So I\u2019ve been shopping around for a new religion to see me through the next four years.",
        "Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto told an assembly of top diplomats last week that \u201cMexico of course will not pay\u201d for Donald Trump\u2019s wall. His predecessor, former president Vicente Fox, put it more bluntly in a tweet storm last week, declaring: \u201cTRUMP, when will you understand that I am not paying for that [ ] wall. \u201d They are both wrong. Trump absolutely can make Mexico pay. And the answer lies in a provision of the corporate plan House Republicans are planning to take up after Trump\u2019s inauguration \u2014 the \u201cborder adjustment.",
        "Never one to shun Bill O\u2019Reilly last night reminded viewers about how they\u2019d once again vaulted his program to the very top of the rankings. That comment led to talk about how the leader of the \u201cO\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d was seeking to keep the program vital. Here\u2019s a critical component of that initiative, per O\u2019Reilly himself: We are not going to use any fanatical ideologues anymore. We cut down on that last year, and it\u2019s worked. Used to be I\u2019d go after folks who did not have rational arguments.",
        "The new poll has little good news for Donald Trump. Clear majorities expect he will do a good job on the economy and fighting terrorism, and that\u2019s about it. He enters office with by far the lowest favorability rating of any incoming president in at least 40 years. But Democrats shouldn\u2019t sit around and wait for the Trump presidency to collapse in on itself; the president who entered office with the favorability rating in the last 40 years was Ronald Reagan (though his 58 percent approval was still much higher than Trump\u2019s 40 percent).",
        "Democrats will need to shape the political battlefield if they want to stop elements of Donald Trump\u2019s agenda and set themselves up to at least hold even, if not gain seats, in 2018. They have figured out that Trump watches TV a lot, so their opposition must often take the form of big events (e. g. marches to preserve Obamacare) or media narratives (e. g. more than 50 Democrats won\u2019t go to the inauguration).",
        "On Tuesday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a new report that makes clear the magnitude of the calamity Republicans are preparing to unleash on the country. While it doesn\u2019t tell the whole story of this debate, it shows why their effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act is already spurring a public backlash, and why that backlash is only going to grow. In this report, the CBO examined the \u201cRestoring Americans\u2019 Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015,\u201d which still forms the basis of the repeal effort.",
        "BAMAKO, Mali \u2014 The Nigerian air force on Tuesday bombed a crowded town full of people who had fled Islamist militants, killing more than 50 in what was described as a mistake by pilots targeting Boko Haram fighters.

        "Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Interior Department told senators Tuesday that completing billions of dollars in backlogged projects at national parks should be a major part of the new president\u2019s plans to revamp aging roads, bridges and transportation hubs. Rep. Ryan Zinke ( .) who is nominated to serve as the next interior secretary, told the Senate Natural Resources Committee that Trump\u2019s ambitious infrastructure spending plans should \u201cprioritize the estimated $12. 5 billion in backlog of maintenance and repair\u201d at hundreds of national parks across the country.",
        "As Donald Trump prepares to take office, the Islamic State is on the defensive in three countries and has been all but wiped out in another. Two and a half years after the extremists rolled across northern Iraq, Pentagon and diplomatic officials say a military victory, at least in their major strongholds, is within sight. But tens of thousands of fighters remain, and the militants are showing signs of reinventing themselves as a dispersed terrorist movement \u2014 a threat that the incoming commander in chief says has been given too much time to grow.",
        "LONDON \u201d Britain will seek a clean break from the European Union, Prime Minister Theresa May said Tuesday in a speech that eliminated any doubt her country would pursue a starkly different path outside the bloc, which for decades has been at the heart of attempts at continental integration.

Freelance stylist Tricia Kelly says she was contacted by a longtime client with ties to the Trumps about a job coifing Marla Maples and the younger Trump daughter for the big event.",
        "There are no guarantees in life, least of all in the movie business. Megastars Ben Affleck and Martin Scorsese have reliably provided hits before. But both men\u2019s films bombed at the box office during their wide releases. Over the holiday weekend, Affleck\u2019s \u201cLive by Night\u201d brought in an estimated $5. 4 million and Scorsese\u2019s \u201cSilence\u201d earned a projected $1. 9 million.
