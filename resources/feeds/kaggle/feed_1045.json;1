        "Scott Pruitt, who repeatedly has sued the Environmental Protection Agency during his tenure as Oklahoma attorney general, declined to say Wednesday whether he would recuse himself from those ongoing cases if confirmed as the agency\u2019s new leader. Questioned by Sen. Edward J. Markey ( .) on whether he would avoid involvement in a series of ongoing cases against the EPA that he had been party to while in Oklahoma, Pruitt said he would rely on the advice of agency ethics lawyers on a basis.",
        "South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley departed sharply from Donald Trump on a range of foreign policy issues Wednesday, creating some awkwardness as she fielded questions from senators on Capitol Hill. During her confirmation hearing to be the next United Nations ambassador, Haley voiced heavy skepticism about Russia and optimism about NATO, both deviations from some of Trump\u2019s statements. She unequivocally shot down the idea of a Muslim registry or ban, which Trump has never fully disavowed.",
        "Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross singled out changes to the nation\u2019s free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada on Wednesday as \u201cthe first thing\u201d he would address if confirmed to lead the Commerce Department in Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Speaking before the Senate Commerce Committee, Ross argued that the United States should open its economic borders to countries that \u201cplay by the rules. \u201d But those that do not, he said, \u201cshould be punished \u2014 severely. \u201d \u201cI am not . I am pro trade,\u201d Ross said.",
        "At her contentious confirmation hearing as Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to be education secretary on Tuesday, Betsy DeVos was asked a question by Sen. Al Franken ( .) about an important education debate involving how student progress should be measured. The query essentially rendered her speechless as she appeared not to know how to answer. When Franken told her he was upset she didn\u2019t understand it, she did not protest.",
        "President Obama walked off the stage Wednesday sounding remarkably like the political newcomer who burst onto the political scene 13 years ago. That Obama, a neophyte state senator from Illinois, was striking mostly for his faith in America\u2019s institutions, its founding documents and its people. \u201cHope in the face of difficulty,\u201d he preached in a speech to the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. \u201cHope in the face of uncertainty. The audacity of hope . . . a belief that there are better days ahead.",
        "The first instinct was to fight. He\u2019d call their bluff. Come out swinging. \u201cProve it,\u201d Joel Rich wanted to say. Prove my boy died because he was some kind of a mole, an email hacker, a cog in a conspiracy, a patsy in an international political intrigue. Prove it! Yet Joel Rich knew he wouldn\u2019t get anywhere trying to knock down each new Internet rumor about the death this past summer of his son, Seth. \u201cPeople don\u2019t care about the truth anymore,\u201d the father lamented.",
        "This story has been updated. In a powerful testament to the warming of the planet, two leading U. S. science agencies Wednesday jointly declared 2016 the hottest year on record, surpassing the previous record set just last year \u2014 which itself had topped a record set in 2014. Average surface temperatures in 2016, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, were 0. 07 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than 2015 and featured eight successive months (January through August) that were individually the warmest since the agency\u2019s records began in 1880.",
        "Dr. Tom Price, the orthopedic surgeon tapped by Donald Trump to oversee the Department of Health and Human Services, has found a miracle cure for ailing investment portfolios. Price, a Georgia Republican, did some creative investing while leading the House Budget Committee last year. He bought stock in a maker of joint replacements a week before he introduced legislation that would help the company \u2014 which then made a campaign contribution to Price. Nothing to see here, says the Trump team: A broker bought the shares without Price\u2019s knowledge.",
        "Aimee Murphy is founder of Life Matters Journal. Note to the women\u2019s movement: It is possible to be both and a feminist. In fact, it is possible to be and a feminist and opposed to Donald Trump. It\u2019s too bad the organizers of the Women\u2019s March on Washington refuse to accept this fact. This week march organizers indicated that women like me are not welcome in their ranks. When the Atlantic reported that the Women\u2019s March had approved New Wave Feminists, a feminist group, as an official partner, Twitter exploded with the rage of a thousand feminists.",
        "LADIES! Welcome to the TRUMP ERA, not to be confused with the regular ERA, a thing that increases your rights. Just the other week, someone was so excited by the news that he did not have to be politically correct any longer that he went out and committed a sexual assault! Hooray, what a golden and great new age for people (men). First, before the inauguration, what should you do with your hair and face?",
        "Meet the new Chinese President Xi Jinping. With an ode to globalization at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday, a commitment to invest $360 billion in renewable energy, a pledge to open China further to foreign investment and a plea not to engage in a trade war, China\u2019s strongman is trying to position himself as the adult supervisor in a world where the United States, in China\u2019s view, is soon to be run by a petulant child. On one hand, Xi\u2019s paean to the global elites makes sense.",
        "For a journalist, there are few things quite so distressing as a retraction request. It\u2019s a form of nuclear pushback, the ultimate in combat between the subject of a news article and a media outlet. Not only are the facts of the story off, says the retraction request, but also its entire thrust, its reason for being, is null. As Donald Trump and his people lay waste to various norms and standards, they now appear intent on defanging the retraction request.",
        "A spokesman for Donald Trump said Wednesday that he was \u201ctroubled\u201d by President Obama\u2019s commutation of the prison sentence of Chelsea Manning, an Army private convicted of taking troves of secret diplomatic and military documents and disclosing them to WikiLeaks. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing, and it sends a very troubling message when it comes to the handling of classified information and to the consequences of those who leak information that threatens the security of our nation,\u201d Sean Spicer, Trump\u2019s incoming White House press secretary, told reporters.",
        "For President Obama, the war in Afghanistan has been a matter of profound ambivalence \u2014 a strategic necessity and an unmistakable burden. He has talked about the United States\u2019 interest in preventing the country from ever becoming a sanctuary for global terrorists. Just as often, he has spoken of ending the war and the limits of American military power, money, patience and time. Nearly eight years after Obama began his presidency with a long and contentious Afghanistan strategy review, he is leaving behind for Donald Trump a war that reflects his divided outlook.",
        "Former president George H. W. Bush was under observation at an intensive care unit in Houston on Wednesday after being treated for an \u201cacute respiratory problem stemming from pneumonia,\u201d according to a statement from his office. The update described the Bush as \u201cstable and resting comfortably\u201d at Houston Methodist Hospital, but gave no details on how long the former president could remain under medical attention. At the same hospital, former first lady Barbara Bush was also admitted Wednesday as a \u201cprecaution\u201d after experiencing fatigue and coughing, a separate statement said.",
        "Donald Trump takes office Friday as the oldest incoming president in U. S. history \u2014 a who can expect to live 15 more years, according to actuarial data. But unlike the fitness fanatic whom he follows into the White House, Trump apparently has never smoked tobacco. He doesn\u2019t drink alcohol. And as a wealthy American, he has presumably spent much of his life with access to excellent health care.",
        "It was the overnight shift at the Montgomery County jail in Dayton, Ohio, and Joseph Guglielmo banged on the door of cell 114 again and again. The veteran with stress disorder had been arrested at a homeless shelter earlier that night in January 2015. He\u2019d struggled with a security guard at the shelter and against the officers who had come to arrest him. Now he was demanding some unspecified medicine and annoying his guards. So, his civil rights complaint says, they decided to \u201cteach him a lesson. \u201d Six guards gathered in front of cell 114, Guglielmo\u2019s attorney said.",
        "A majority of the Supreme Court seemed highly skeptical Wednesday that the federal government can refuse to register all trademarks that may be disparaging, casting this as the government improperly taking sides in free speech disputes. Justice Elena Kagan said that a government program that allowed only positive speech and denied negative speech would be a \u201cfairly classic case of viewpoint discrimination,\u201d in which the government cannot engage. The court was considering the case of an Asian American band called the Slants, whose founder was denied trademark registration for the group\u2019s name.",
        "The inauguration is fast approaching, and D. C. is transforming to accommodate the estimated 1 million attendees and protesters expected to descend on the city this week.

        "This post has been updated. Thousands of people are expected to be in the region Saturday for the Women\u2019s March on Washington, an event that could draw larger crowds than Inauguration Day itself, and present travel challenges for participants and residents. Drivers will encounter \u2014 and rolling \u2014 road closures near the Mall and public transit users should expect long waits at Metro stations and crowding on platforms and trains. \u201cPeople need to allow themselves lots of extra time for reaching the rally point,\u201d our expert, Dr. Gridlock, aka Robert Thomson says.",
        "The Teddy Boys were a study in contrast \u2014 a cocktail of formal styling and vulgarity, poured together and shaken up violently. The youth culture emerged shortly after the birth of the concept of the \u201cteenager\u201d sweeping the U. K. in the 1950s. Instantly recognizable in their dress, they pushed against War II society with flamboyance and . They favored luxe fabrics cut into sharp suits, tied it together with a bootlace or thin tie, and whipped their hair into resplendent quiffs.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s arrival in Washington Thursday on the eve of his inauguration as the 45th president snapped the capital city into its new reality, as the buoyant business mogul celebrated his unlikely political ascent with signature bravado and spontaneity.

        "\u201cWe meet on democracy\u2019s front porch, a good place to talk as neighbors and as friends,\u201d George H. W. Bush said from the expansive West Front of the Capitol moments after taking the presidential oath in 1989. \u201cFor this is a day when our nation is made whole, when our differences, for a moment, are suspended. \u201d That is the imagined ideal of Inauguration Day, a time of coming together in the spirit of national unity.",
        "As he held court Thursday afternoon inside the ballroom of the Trump International Hotel, Donald Trump could not resist plugging the luxurious locale playing host to his Cabinet appointees, top Republican congressional leaders and hundreds of the GOP\u2019s wealthiest donors. \u201cThis is a gorgeous room,\u201d the president said of his new hotel\u2019s presidential ballroom. \u201cA total genius must have built this place.",
        "From his picture window overlooking New York\u2019s Central Park, Donald Trump could see the public ice rink that the city government had spent six years and $12 million trying \u2014 and failing \u2014 to repair. Most people saw the shuttered rink as a maddening waste of public dollars. Trump saw an opportunity to lead. In 1986, Trump, then a brash newcomer in the New York real estate industry, offered to fix the rink in six months at his own expense. Trump\u2019s move was at once bold, magnanimous and biting.",
        "When Donald Trump successfully demanded that Carrier keep some manufacturing jobs from going to Mexico, he was criticized at first for bullying the heating and cooling giant and for violating the Republican Party\u2019s capitalist ethos. In the eight weeks since, however, the atmosphere has changed dramatically. Almost daily, in Twitter missives as well as private meetings, Trump continues to hector businesses to make investments in the United States.",
        "The Arkansas State Society has a grand tradition of throwing elegant inaugural affairs. In 1953, when President Eisenhower was sworn in, it hosted a ball, a reception and a square dance. The 1993 celebration for President Clinton featured a performance by first brother Roger Clinton and his blues band, Politics. In 2009, 1, 000 guests turned out for the society\u2019s party to celebrate the first inauguration of President Obama, who lost the state by nearly 20 points. This year, the Arkansas ball was canceled due to lack of interest, organizers told Little Rock\u2019s .",

The house sits grandly on Midland Parkway in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood in Queens, its portico upheld by six white columns, as if a plantation manse from the South had been transplanted to suburbia.

The Mexican Foreign Ministry announced the transfer, saying it culminated a lengthy court battle by Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers for him to remain in Mexico, where he had repeatedly managed to escape from prison and had lived like a king most of the time that he was behind bars.",
        "Treasury secretary nominee Steven T. Mnuchin defended his ties to offshore business entities and his management of a controversial California bank during a testy confirmation hearing on Thursday. Speaking before the Senate Finance committee, Mnuchin said businesses in the Cayman Islands and Anguilla revealed in his financial disclosures were not used for his personal benefit but served nonprofits and pensions. A memo compiled by Democratic committee staffers obtained by The Washington Post showed Mnuchin initially omitted some of those entities as well as more than $100 million in personal assets from his nomination paperwork. Mnuchin has revised the documents."
