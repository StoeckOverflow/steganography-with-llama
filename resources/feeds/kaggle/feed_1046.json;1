        "Former Texas governor Rick Perry, Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to run the Energy Department, parried questions about climate change at his confirmation hearing Thursday morning, reversing his earlier skeptical stance but still balking when pressed to declare it a crisis. Perry also expressed contrition for campaigning for the presidency in 2012 on the promise of abolishing the agency. \u201cMy past statements made over five years ago about abolishing the Department of Energy do not reflect my current thinking,\u201d Perry said in his opening statement to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.",
        "Anita Hill is a professor of social policy, law, and women\u2019s studies at Brandeis University. Of the thousands of letters I received in the course of my public thrashing before the Senate Judiciary committee during the October 1991 Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings, one in particular stands out. A seventh grader shared with me her frustration with the whole mess \u2014 indeed, with politics in general. Her class had voted on whether to believe my allegations that Thomas had sexually harassed me, or his denials. She voted for me, and wanted me to win.",
        "Two big and passionate crowds have descended on Washington \u2014 one thrilled by Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, the other appalled. Never in my lifetime has a new president been anticipated with such raw enthusiasm on one side and such fear and loathing on the other. Admit it, you have no idea what a Trump administration will actually be like. Neither does Trump, I would wager. He is a business executive and extraordinaire whose lifelong working habit is to go to his office, see what opportunities the day presents, and then improvise. He is not going to change.",
        "The New York Times announced yesterday \u2014 it was the paper\u2019s top story, above the fold \u2014 that Donald Trump is unpopular. The Times\u2019 news coverage and editorial page have castigated and virtually everything the has said or done, so the story reads more like an review than a news item. But fair enough. Polls conducted by several different organizations really do place Trump\u2019s approval ratings in the . Why is this, according to the Times report?",
        "Any time a new administration comes into office, there will be some complaining about the new president\u2019s cabinet picks. But we\u2019re seeing something extraordinary happening now. Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet brings with it a combination of ethical problems, inexperience, hostility to the missions of the departments its members are being called to lead, and plain old ignorance that is simply unprecedented. This is shaping up to be nothing less than the worst cabinet in American history. As just one colorful example, let\u2019s look at this report in today\u2019s New York Times about Rick Perry, who will be Secretary of Energy.",
        "Barack Obama did not go out quietly. His unquiet final acts were, in part, overshadowed by a successor who refused to come in quietly and, in part, by Obama\u2019s own endless, sentimental farewell tour. But there was nothing nostalgic or sentimental about Obama\u2019s last acts. Two of them were simply shocking. Perhaps we should have known. At the 2015 White House correspondents\u2019 dinner, he joked about whether he had a bucket list: \u201cWell, I have something that rhymes with bucket list. \u201d Turns out, he wasn\u2019t kidding.",
        "\u201c TRUMP: You are about to take the most serious oath of office anyone has the privilege to take. You were not my choice, but I support and respect the office. \u201d Those are the heartfelt words of Kit Keane, 66, of Chicago, one of many who responded when we asked readers to share their hopes and advice for incoming president Donald Trump. The inauguration of a president is always, on one level, a political event: One party has triumphed, the other has been vanquished.",
        "As they rode in the presidential limousine to the U. S. Capitol on Inauguration Day in 2009, President George W. Bush offered some advice to Barack Obama: Announce a pardon policy early and stick to it. \u201cOn the ride up Pennsylvania Avenue . . . I told Barack Obama about my frustrations with the pardon system,\u201d Bush wrote in his memoir. Obama did not seriously focus on pardons and commutations until 2014, two years into his second term.",
        "NAIROBI \u2014 Senegal announced that its troops entered neighboring Gambia on Thursday to force its longtime ruler, Yahya Jammeh, to step down, part of a bold West African regional effort to defend a democratic election won by the opposition. The operation was announced after the successor chosen by voters last month, Adama Barrow, took the oath of office from exile in the Senegalese capital. \u201cWe have entered Gambia,\u201d Senegalese army Col. Abdou Ndiaye wrote in a text message to the Reuters news agency. There were few other immediate details of the reported incursion.",
        "Two Air Force stealth bombers struck Islamic State camps southwest of the Libyan city of Sirte on Wednesday night, less than a month after the Pentagon declared an end to an extended air campaign there. Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said that the aircraft, known for their distinctive appearance, dropped more than 100 bombs and hit two Islamic State encampments about 30 miles outside Sirte. The outposts were inhabited at least in part by fighters who had fled the city in the fall, and the operation was approved by President Obama, Cook said. Defense Secretary Ashton B.",
        "Newly released CIA documents expose a bitter internal feud over the qualifications and ethics of two former military psychologists who pushed the agency to adopt interrogation methods widely condemned as torture. A series of internal emails reveal that the CIA\u2019s own medical and psychological personnel expressed deep concern about an arrangement that put two outside contractors in charge of subjecting detainees to brutal measures including waterboarding, then also evaluating whether those methods were working or causing lasting harm.",
        "ROME \u2014 In the darkness under tons of snow, the survivors reached for their only lifeline. From their phones, text messages were punched out to 112, the Italian emergency response number. \u201cHelp,\u201d one couple wrote after their hotel was buried in an avalanche, \u201cwe\u2019re dying of cold. \u201d But when rescuers on Thursday finally reached the resort \u2014 swallowed by a wall of white that roared down the Gran Sasso mountains in central Italy a day earlier \u2014 there was only silence from under the crush of snow, rocks and splintered fir trees.",
        "This is when grace leaves the White House. Without talking about politics or policy, without getting into race or class, red or blue, the Obamas set a remarkable standard for personal decency and civility during their years as our first family. The Obamas came in making history, changing America on Day 1. They were the first African American occupants of the country\u2019s most famous address, a home slaves helped build. Few families have faced such scrutiny. Would they be too black? Would they be too white?",
        "When Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey folds its circus tents in May, about 400 people will be out of a job. So will dozens of animals. The show\u2019s famous elephants are already retired, now living out their days on the company\u2019s conservation center in Florida. Some acts, like the dogs and the lions, are owned by their handlers and will remain with them. But the kangaroos, horses, camels, tigers and others belong to Feld Entertainment, the producer of Ringling, which has said it will find them suitable homes.",
        "A Republican legislative aide in Maryland who was behind a fake news site that accused Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton of was fired Wednesday. Del. David E. Vogt III ( ) said he terminated Cameron Harris \u201con the spot\u201d after learning that he was the mastermind behind Christian TimesNewspaper. com and its fabricated Sept. 30 article, which reported that there were tens of thousands of \u201cfraudulent Clinton votes found\u201d in an Ohio warehouse. Harris, who graduated from Davidson College in North Carolina in May, had worked for the Republican delegate since June.",
        "Donald John Trump was sworn in Friday as the 45th president of the United States, after which he delivered a dark but ambitious speech promising to throw out entrenched Washington elites, end \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d in cities and restore jobs lost to shuttered factories. \u201cToday, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, D. C. and giving it back to you, the people,\u201d Trump said.",
        "Protesters made themselves heard in the nation\u2019s capital Friday, leaving a trail of damage along some city blocks, disrupting security checkpoints at President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, and clashing with police as Trump supporters tried to celebrate. As people poured into the city to watch Trump sworn in as the 45th president, they encountered protesters across the area throughout the day. Many of the demonstrations were nonviolent, with people holding signs that spoke to their causes and concerns.",
        "Just moments after President Trump took the oath of office Friday, the official White House website was transformed into a set of policy pledges and absence of them that offered the broad contours of the Trump administration\u2019s top priorities, including fierce support for law enforcement and gun owners\u2019 rights to defend themselves, the disappearance of the outgoing White House\u2019s policy page on climate change and a notable lack of any directives involving former president Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. Otherwise, Trump\u2019s first day as the nation\u2019s chief executive was largely ceremonial.",
        "It\u2019s raining in Washington today \u2014 or, at least, it\u2019s rainy. It\u2019s not cold, really, at 45 degrees, but there are certainly reasons one might rather stay inside than, say, head to the Mall to watch an outdoor event. Perhaps that\u2019s one reason that the crowd in attendance at Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration seems a bit more sparse than in years past. Or perhaps it actually is more sparse \u2014 particularly in comparison to the first inauguration of Barack Obama in 2009. It can be tricky to evaluate attendance at events based solely on photos.",
        "Donald Trump began his presidency with blunt, searing talk about a crippled nation in dire need of bold, immediate action. Breaking with more than two centuries of history, the new president made clear, in case anyone had not yet gotten it, that his will be a very different presidency. Trump spurned the poetry and grandeur of most inaugural speeches and instead delivered a rallying cry, reminiscent of his campaign talks, brimming with brash bravado about his intention to bring massive change: \u201cThis American carnage stops right here and stops right now.",
        "Generally, inaugural addresses are not designed to be . But President Trump\u2019s address was nothing if not unique, presenting a portrait of the United States that often was at variance with reality. Here\u2019s a guide to understanding whether the facts back up his rhetoric. \u201cWashington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered, but the jobs left and the factories closed. \u201d Trump engages in some sleight of hand here, equating \u201cpoliticians\u201d with \u201cWashington.",
        "On his first day in office, President Trump declared on the White House website that he would roll back a rule that has been opposed as bad for business by a coalition that included his own golf courses. He also effectively became his own landlord at his District hotel, which his company rents from the federal government despite a lease that forbids such benefits going to any elected official. A Trump golf course tweeted congratulations to its owner as he became president, though a Trump lawyer had previously promised that no company social media accounts would reference his office.",
        "LONDON \u2014 If the credo of the new U. S. president is \u201cAmerica first,\u201d as Donald Trump emphatically declared Friday in his strikingly nationalistic inaugural address, then where does that leave the rest of the world? That is what people around the globe \u2014 from Latin America to the Middle East to Asia \u2014 were left to wonder after watching Trump use the opening minutes of his presidency to double down on campaign pledges to end what he sees as misguided efforts to help other countries at the expense of U. S. interests.",
        "It began at about the time Chuck Schumer, addressing the inauguration crowd from the Capitol, lamented that politics is \u201cfrequently consumed by rancor. \u201d It sounded at first, from my seat in the plaza below the inaugural platform, like a helicopter flying low over the mall, or perhaps an unusually loud jet taking off from Reagan National Airport. But I turned to discover the noise was the combined booing and jeering of thousands in the sea of red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d caps.",
        "This will be the presidency of the raised fist, not the outstretched hand. Inaugural addresses are traditionally occasions of inclusion and healing. In that transformative moment, the new president sheds a partisan identity and assumes the mantle of national leader, president of and for all the people. If any new president should have sounded that soothing note, it was President Trump. If any nation needed to hear it, it was America today. The state of our union is dangerously frayed. The country is in a volatile and fragile condition that requires attending to, not ignoring.",
        "The question that swirls around Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural address is whether his aggressively pronounced policy of America First will actually result in America Last \u2014 not literally last, but declining in power and prestige because the United States no longer views its role in the world as promoting economic and geopolitical stability for our allies. Instead, he imagines a world in which the United States takes what it can and worries about others only as an afterthought. What does he expect other countries to do? The answer is obvious.",
        "Twenty minutes into his presidency, Donald Trump, who is always claiming to have made, or to be about to make, astonishing history, had done so. Living down to expectations, he had delivered the most dreadful inaugural address in history. Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s White House counselor, had promised that the speech would be \u201celegant. \u201d This is not the adjective that came to mind as he described \u201cAmerican carnage. \u201d That was a phrase the likes of which has never hitherto been spoken at an inauguration.",
        "Hugh Hewitt hosts a nationally syndicated radio show and is author of the forthcoming \u201cThe Fourth Way: The Conservative Playbook for a Lasting GOP Majority. \u201d My wife and I welcomed Mike and Debbie for dinner at our California home Tuesday night. Our longtime friends are not alarmists, and they are not liberal Democrats. They are in fact the sort of genuine \u201cmoderate middle\u201d voter that most consultants would die to have in a focus group: smart, caring, connected in their community, successful parents and employers. I\u2019m more conservative than they are.",
        "FOR ANYONE who hoped that President Trump would use his inaugural address to lower America\u2019s political temperature, or expected that the rancor of 2016 would give way to elevated expressions more typical of, and appropriate to, an Inauguration Day, the new president\u2019s remarks Friday can only be described as a sharp disappointment. Like his alarmist speech to the Republican National Convention in July, this one painted a false picture of an impoverished, country that has been cheated and victimized by Washington elites and grasping interests abroad. Mr.",
        "The Senate confirmed John F. Kelly as secretary of homeland security on Friday, putting the retired Marine general in charge of securing the nation\u2019s borders, including construction of the controversial southwest border wall that was a centerpiece of President Trump\u2019s campaign. Senators approved Kelly\u2019s nomination to run the Department of Homeland Security, a sprawling entity of more than 240, 000 employees who do everything from protecting the president to safeguarding the nation\u2019s electrical grid. Kelly, who retired in February as chief of the U. S."
