        "The Senate confirmed James N. Mattis as President Trump\u2019s defense secretary Friday, breaking with decades of precedent by making a recently retired general the Pentagon\u2019s top civilian leader. Mattis, 66, was approved with a vote. He will lead the Defense Department\u2019s 1. 9 million service members and reservists and oversee a budget of more than $580 billion as Trump prepares to expand the military. He becomes the first senior military officer to serve as defense secretary since President Truman nominated Army Gen. George C. Marshall for the job in 1950, as the U. S.",
        "The $50 book about Donald Trump is displayed at the very front of the National Museum of American History\u2019s gift shop, its cover featuring the newly inaugurated president\u2019s signature . \u201cDonald Trump: 45th President of the United States Collector\u2019s Vault\u201d shares real estate with acclaimed nonfiction by established historians such as James M. McPherson, Roger Lowenstein and Walter Isaacson. But the Trump book, written by Brandon Christopher Hall, a from Atlanta, might not meet their standards for accuracy.",
        "Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the U. S. soldier who faces on a charge of desertion after walking away from his base in Afghanistan and spending five years in militant captivity, sought and failed to receive a presidential pardon by President Barack Obama before he left office, according to Bergdahl\u2019s attorney Eugene Fidell. The attorney acknowledged the effort Friday after Berghdahl\u2019s legal team filed a new motion to dismiss the Army\u2019s case against their client, citing past harsh rhetoric against Bergdahl by newly President Trump.",
        "As America changes presidents, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is doing something. This week, he did something in Texas: He went to his first rodeo. He wore a hard hat and a safety vest. He thanked police officers in Dallas for their hard work. He helped plant a community garden. So what, exactly, is Mark Zuckerberg doing? Well, even without a peep from the man confirming any interest in the job, some have started to believe that Zuckerberg is running for president.",
        "NAIROBI \u2014 West African envoys made a effort Friday to persuade Gambia\u2019s longtime leader to step down, as a regional military coalition threatened to remove him by force if he failed to concede he had lost last month\u2019s presidential election. Adama Barrow, the winner of that election, later announced that President Yahya Jammeh \u201chas agreed to step down. \u201d Barrow wrote on Twitter: \u201cHe is scheduled to depart Gambia today. \u201d But there was no immediate official confirmation from Jammeh, or from the envoys who were negotiating with him, the presidents of Mauritania and Guinea.",
        "ROME \u2014 Rescuers have made contact with at least 10 survivors Friday who huddled for two days in the rubble of a resort hotel buried under tons of snow that roared down a mountainside in central Italy, an official said. Several of those trapped were brought to safety through tunnels carved through the snow while others awaited rescuers. The spokesman for Italy\u2019s firefighting service, Luca Cari, told reporters that 10 people have been detected so far in the rubble of the hotel even as the death toll climbed to four.",
        "Millions of women gathered in Washington and in cities around the country and the world Saturday to mount a roaring rejoinder to the inauguration of President Donald Trump. What started as a Facebook post by a Hawaii retiree became an unprecdented international rebuke of a new president that packed cities large and small \u2014 from London to Los Angeles, Paris to Park City, Utah, Miami to Melbourne, Australia. The Washington organizers, who originally sought a permit for a gathering of 200, 000, said Saturday that as many as a half million people participated.",
        "The Women\u2019s March on Washington was huge! But now the task of getting home faces the massive crowd, and as any regular Washington commuter will tell you, the trip home can be more daunting than the trip into the District. So expect packed Metro stations and trains, long waits at intersections and crowded bridges. Here is the latest news: \u2018Keep going to the front! Keep going to the front!\u2019 (4:41 p. m.) A broken escalator backs up a huge crowd at Farragut North.",
        "miles into a trip, the women riding the bus began to stir as the blackness of the morning lifted. They had gathered at 3:30 a. m. in a parking lot in Williamsport, Pa. and now, as signs for Washington started appearing, one woman applied makeup with a mirror, another bounced a baby on her lap, and two more talked about what could happen when they got where they were going. As the bus entered the city on Baltimore Washington Parkway, Joanne Barr looked out the others talked about the marches that had happened the night before around the world.",
        "On his first full day in office, President Trump visited the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s headquarters to express his gratitude for the intelligence community, which he had repeatedly railed against and recently likened to Nazis. What Trump delivered Saturday was a airing of grievances \u2014 at the Senate for delaying confirmation of his nominees; at critics for questioning whether he is smart and vigorous; and at journalists, whom he called \u201cthe most dishonest human beings on earth\u201d and accused of lying about the size of his inauguration crowd.",
        "President Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sean Spicer, on Saturday used his first media briefing to angrily lambaste the press for its coverage of the new administration, claiming reporters had deliberately sought to minimize the \u201cenormous\u201d crowd at Trump\u2019s on Friday. \u201cThis was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period \u2014 both in person and around the globe,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cThese attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong.",
        "President Trump\u2019s decision to appoint his as a senior adviser did not violate a federal law, the Justice Department found in a formal legal opinion issued Saturday. The opinion, written by a veteran of the department who had been honored by former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. concluded that the president has special hiring authority that overrides a federal law that forbids executive branch officials from employing family members.",
        "Some were vulgar, others were angry. Most were earnest. These were my favorite signs at Saturday\u2019s Women\u2019s March on Washington: #FreeMelania No Country for Dirty Old Men Sad!",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural address was all the things commentators said it was \u2014 pugnacious, nationalistic, a repudiation of the Obama years and a warning to the power brokers of both parties. As I listened, though, I thought I heard echoes of another address. Only when I read the speech afterward did I realize: Trump\u2019s speech bore an astonishing resemblance to Barack Obama\u2019s first inaugural address, in 2009. Trump sharply criticized Washington\u2019s power elite \u2014 many of whom sat nearby.",
        "The weather was dreary, but the mood was ebullient. Hundreds of thousands flooded downtown Washington with posters, face paint, signs and hats, far more attendees than the organizers had expected. \u201cWe\u2019re just so excited to be here,\u201d one woman gushed. \u201cIt feels like part of history. \u201d I\u2019m describing, of course, Saturday\u2019s Women\u2019s March on Washington, not Friday\u2019s inauguration of President Trump. The latter was a much grimmer affair, dogged by protests during the oath of office and the \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d invoked in Trump\u2019s inaugural speech, while the march seemed positively gleeful. The question, though, is what comes next.",
        "Friday\u2019s inauguration taught me three lessons about the political dynamics of our televisual age, as mastered by an expert at reality television, our newly inaugurated president. These lessons may give us some insight into what is to come, not just in this administration but in U. S. politics generally. Once upon a time, in the early American republic, politics was about talk. Sam Adams, the Sons of Liberty and the Committees of Correspondence built interlocking conversations throughout the colonies that drove a revolution. Town committees linked to conversations, and these linked to conversations in the Continental Congress.",
        "After every major Trump speech or event, the person I was before it seems desperately naive. I have been a consistent Trump critic, but my expectations are never quite low enough. Some of us approach Inauguration Day with a kind of democratic reverence. Its customs encourage the love of country. The best inaugural addresses offer historical context, emphasize shared values, encourage engaged citizenship, express goals worthy of a great nation, and at least attempt to wrap it all up in a neat package of rhetorical ambition.",
        "As Donald Trump takes the oath of office Friday, a shadow will loom over his inauguration. Is it his multitudinous conflicts of interest and almost certain violation of the Emoluments Clause? Well, yes, but there\u2019s another shadow: Hillary Clinton. Clinton may not have been the right person to beat Trump in November, but since then, she\u2019s been the perfect person to lose to him. Despite her own efforts to bow out discreetly \u2014 to the margins of the Democratic Party, to bookstores, to the woods \u2014 he can\u2019t get her out of his head.",
        "It wasn\u2019t all that long ago that it would have seemed impossible for anybody who labeled the U. S. public education system a \u201cdead end\u201d to be nominated as U. S. Secretary of Education, much less get support to be confirmed. Not anymore. Betsy DeVos, a Republican billionaire from Michigan who public school advocates see as hostile to America\u2019s public education system, is likely to be confirmed despite a rocky Senate committee hearing, where, under caustic Democratic questioning, she seemed not to know basic education issues.",
        "Nearly simultaneously with President Trump\u2019s oath of office Friday, the White House website shifted to remove climate change related content from the Obama administration and supplant it with a new statement of Trump\u2019s energy policy \u2014 one focused, it said, reducing \u201cburdensome regulations on our energy industry. \u201d Those are just words \u2014 but an action hours later by White House chief of staff Reince Priebus had more teeth.",
        "American carnage? Honey, you don\u2019t know the half of it. As the daytime ballyhoo dispersed, the scent of scorched limousine on the breeze, there were still the nighttime inaugural balls to deal with Friday: a whole battery of official and unofficial parties, with blistered people limping in tight dress shoes and staggering through dark streets in ball gowns while yelling, \u201cThe other security guard told me this was the entrance; no I\u2019m not going back there again.",
        "Amid the glitz of President Trump\u2019s inaugural festivities, one item stood out in particular late Friday night: a spectacular cake that the new president and Vice President Pence cut into with a sword. To pastry chef Duff Goldman, the cake seemed a little too familiar \u2014 because it looked almost exactly like one he had made years earlier for Barack Obama\u2019s second inauguration as president. Just after midnight, the Food Network personality posted a comparison of two cakes on his Twitter account.",
        "MOSCOW \u2014 Whatever the expectations for President Trump\u2019s new relationship with Russia, anyone looking for a dramatic shift from the Kremlin is going to have to wait past Day One. While some Russian companies and political activists have taken advantage of \u201cTrumpomania\u201d here, holding inauguration parties and putting the new president\u2019s face on sugar cubes and commemorative coins, the Moscow establishment is repeating a simple mantra designed to limit expectations: \u201cDonald Trump is not our man.",
        "ISTANBUL \u2014 After weeks of raucous parliamentary debate that included fisticuffs and lawmakers in Turkey overwhelmingly passed several constitutional amendments early Saturday that, if approved by the public, would grant President Recep Tayyip Erdogan greatly enhanced powers. The changes include amendments that would abolish the post of prime minister, curb governmental oversight by the parliament and give Erdogan the authority to unilaterally issue decrees \u2014 rules that the president\u2019s opponents insist would formalize Turkey\u2019s drift toward authoritarian rule.",
        "Forty years ago, when Arlington resident Andrew Pang was 6, his friend Howard Wall brought him a souvenir from Louisiana, a robin\u2019 1976 dealer license plate. Pang, who was already interested in travel and geography, decided to buck the trend and focus on license plates. \u201cBy the time I was 9 years old, I had one from every state. \u201d The accountant and married father of two is still collecting, as well as selling and trading online. His treasures wallpaper the garage and fill a room in the basement. The commemorative 58th Presidential Inaugural license plate.",
        "In years past, many nutrition and experts gave their patients rigid guidelines to follow. They often counseled eating less, switching to foods, carrying sliced celery in a plastic bag for snack time, and eating foods like salads. This approach proved spectacularly unsuccessful, at least if you judge it by rampant obesity rates. Now, many of these same nutrition experts are taking a simpler, gentler approach. Physician Yoni Freedhoffhas made the switch. Freedhoff also argues that the new way is a better way.",
        "THE CHALLENGE Gayle Herbert\u2019s son, Teddy, is a freshman in college, and she wants to give him a more space to hang out in when he comes home to Arlington. His room has not been updated much since he was a toddler. Because Teddy is still a big baseball fan, she wants to incorporate that into the design, but she would like a space where he can work and lounge and that would be suitable for guests at some point. She is struggling to find a good furniture arrangement around all of the windows and doors.",
        "Washington Post Photographer Matt McClain directs Donald Trump during the shoot. (Jabin Washington Post) At this point, few would dispute that Donald Trump has a prickly relationship with the media. At his first press conference since his election, he called CNN terrible, and BuzzFeed a \u201cfailing pile of garbage. \u201d And during the campaign, he sometimes banned certain outlets, including The Washington Post, from covering his activities. So it was a very welcome surprise when he agreed to sit down (and stand up) for a Post photographer this Tuesday, just days before his inauguration.",
        "President Trump\u2019s executive order instructing federal agencies to grant relief to constituencies affected by the Affordable Care Act has begun to reverberate throughout the nation\u2019s system, injecting further uncertainty into an already unsettled insurance landscape.",
        "\u201dAlternative facts are not facts. They are falsehoods,\u201d Chuck Todd tells Pres. Trump\u2019s counselor Kellyanne Conway this morning. WATCH: pic. twitter. \u2014 Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) January 22, 2017 If there is one video clip that describes the new reality for the political media \u2014 and for the truth \u2014 during the President Trump era, it is the one above. It\u2019s a discussion about White House press secretary Sean Spicer, on his first full day in that job, having taken to the podium and made easily disproved claims about the size of Trump\u2019s inauguration crowd."
