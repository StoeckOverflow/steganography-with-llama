        "\u201cThis was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration \u2014 period \u2014 both in person and around the globe. \u201d \u2014 White House press secretary Sean Spicer, remarks to reporters, Jan. 21, 2017 \u201cI looked out, the field was \u2014 it looked like a million, million and a half people. \u201d \u2014 President Trump, remarks to the CIA, Jan. 21, 2017 It\u2019s rather remarkable that the Trump White House has decided to make easily disproved claims about the size of the inauguration crowd Friday.",
        "The presidency is not a reality show, but President Trump on his first full day in office made clear that he\u2019s still obsessed with being what he once proudly called \u201ca ratings machine. \u201d He cares enough about it to send his press secretary, Sean Spicer, out to brazenly lie to the media in his first official briefing. \u201cThis was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration \u2014 period \u2014 both in person and around the globe,\u201d Spicer said.",
        "If there is one fact about crowd size this weekend that everyone can agree upon, it\u2019s that an inordinate amount of time has been spent arguing about crowd size. Short of individually counting attendees one by one \u2014 and barring technological advancements that could retroactively analyze images to do so \u2014 there may never be undisputed numbers pinned to the inauguration of President Trump or to the Women\u2019s March on Washington that stormed the city the following day. Yet, that has not stopped people from trying to come to a consensus.",
        "President Trump weighed in for the first time on the massive protests against his presidency that took place in Washington and around the globe, stating sarcastically on Twitter on Sunday morning that he was \u201cunder the impression that we just had an election!\u201d His tweet came in response to more than one million people gathering Saturday for the Women\u2019s March on Washington and at other rallies in the United States and abroad, meant as a rejoinder to his inauguration the day before. Trump and his aides remained silent about the protests on Saturday.",
        "If only White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer had stuck with his strong material. In the beginning of his appearance at the White House briefing room on Saturday afternoon, Spicer took aim at Time magazine White House correspondent Zeke Miller. On duty on Inauguration Day as a pool reporter, Miller concluded that the new occupant of the White House had removed a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. He fed that information into the pool report, and others tweeted out the information. Which turned out to be wrong. Correction: The MLK bust is still in the Oval Office.",
        "FRIDAY, THE National Mall filled with thousands of Americans cheering the inauguration of a president. Saturday, it filled even fuller, this time as thousands protested the same man and what they fear his presidency will bring. The Women\u2019s March on Washington was so large that, for a time, it was not even officially a march \u2014 numbers so exceeded expectations that organizers canceled and then rerouted the formal procession to the White House. A demonstration of such scale would have been remarkable on any day.",
        "During the transition period from November through January, Donald Trump developed perhaps the most publicly antagonistic relationship with U. S. intelligence agencies of any incoming president in decades. He compared the agencies to Nazis, disdained their reports as fake and dismissed their assessments of foreign interference in the 2016 election. In an interview published in the Wall Street Journal on Monday, outgoing CIA director John Brennan called Trump\u2019s allegations \u201crepugnant. \u201d Other intelligence officials have expressed a sense of dread about what\u2019s to come.",
        "President Trump\u2019s visit to the CIA on his first day in office shocked some agency veterans because of its combative, political tone. But several said they were glad that Trump seemed to have stopped demonizing the intelligence community and was presenting himself as its best friend. The CIA likes to think of itself as apolitical, serving the president regardless of party. So Trump\u2019s ingratiating message was welcome after months of attacks, including an outrageous comparison of intelligence community leaders to Nazis.",
        "Was Europe in any way reassured by what we heard from President Trump in his inaugural address? Hardly. And let me mention just three points. First: America First! That\u2019s a story that Europe is much too familiar with. Each nation putting itself first, explicitly or implicitly seeing other nations as hostile to its interests, is the European story of centuries of real carnage and catastrophe. Italy First! Sweden First! Serbia First! Germany First! Russia First! France First! Ireland First! We have been there, seen that and done that in Europe. And carnage was the consequence for generations.",
        "Sen. Jeff Sessions ( .) has been the subject of intense debate ever since Donald Trump nominated him to be attorney general. His critics argue that he could lead a radical rollback of civil rights policies, while supporters defend his record as more moderate. Sorting the truth about Sessions from the hyperbole isn\u2019t easy. Myth No. 1 Sessions has an unusually poor record on civil rights.",
        "A senior aide to President Trump said Sunday that he has no plans to release his tax returns, a marked shift from Trump\u2019s pledge during the campaign to make them public once an audit was completed. \u201cThe White House response is that he\u2019s not going to release his tax returns,\u201d said Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, on ABC\u2019S \u201cThis Week. \u201d \u201cWe litigated this all through the election. \u201d \u201cPeople didn\u2019t care,\u201d Conway added.",
        "ADEL, Ga. \u2014 Tornadoes in an unusually brutal winter storm system ripped through the southeast Sunday, killing at least 12 people, flattening much of a park in this southern Georgia town and prompting the governor to declare a state of emergency in at least seven counties near the Florida border. The storms were the latest in a series of violent weather in the region that also killed four people in Hattiesburg, Miss. on Saturday.",
        "TUNJA, Colombia \u2014 Of all the business partners of President Trump who have been hoping to capitalize on his win, there is surely no one who stands to gain quite as much \u2014 relatively speaking \u2014 as young Colombian builder Nicol\u00e1s Jim\u00e9nez. Jim\u00e9nez, you see, doesn\u2019t have much to begin with. His company, Fort\u00fan, is the local partner of U. S. investors who have drawn up a $350 million plan to build the Trump International Hotel and Tower Bogota, featuring two skyscrapers that would be among the tallest in Latin America.",
        "In calls and statements on his first two full days in office, President Trump moved to flesh out what he has described as his \u201cAmerica first\u201d foreign policy, with at least symbolic steps toward goals he expressed during his campaign. Trump invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to visit him at the White House in early February, during a brief telephone call Sunday that Trump described as \u201cvery nice. \u201d A White House statement said the two agreed to consult closely on regional issues, \u201cincluding the threats posed by Iran.",
        "The Atlanta Falcons\u2019 offense is good. Really good. Everyone knows that, of course. The Falcons led the NFL in scoring offense during the regular season. Their quarterback, Matt Ryan, is a league MVP favorite. Their offensive coordinator, Kyle Shanahan, is on his way to becoming the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers. But everyone might have sold these Falcons short. This offense just might be Kurt Warner and the St. Louis Rams, \u201cGreatest Show on Turf\u201d good. It might be Peyton Manning and the good.",
        "Judah Adunbi has spent the greater part of a decade trying to improve relations between police in southwestern England and the members of his community. Still, all the advocacy and the meetings with police were ineffective in getting the dreadlocked man out of the predicament he was in earlier this month \u2014 staring at the business end of a police officer\u2019s Taser. Adunbi had been out walking his dog in Bristol, about 120 miles west of London, when officers mistook him for a robbery suspect, according to the Guardian.",
        "Aziz Ansari kicked off the first episode of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d with a nearly long monologue that addressed President Trump, hate crimes and the divided state of this country. The \u201cMaster of None\u201d and star, who in June wrote a New York Times essay titled \u201cWhy Trump Makes Me Scared for My Family,\u201d also made SNL history this weekend as the show\u2019s first host of South Asian descent. Here\u2019s a transcript of his entire monologue: Thank you, thank you very much. Wow. I can\u2019t believe this. I\u2019m here hosting \u201cSaturday Night Live.",
        "Q: I need advice on helping my son with his fears. He does not like to go upstairs by himself. At night he tells me he does not want to go to bed because he is afraid of bad guys or wolves or scorpions. I try not to quash his emotion, and say something like \u201cScorpions \u2014 that sounds scary. \u201d Then I explain that scorpions do not live in our climate. Once he finally gets into his bed, he regularly wakes at 3 a. m. and climbs into our bed, saying he is scared.",
        "There\u2019s an ongoing gag in the TV show \u201cArrested Development\u201d about the home of the Bluths, the family around which the screwball comedy revolves. The Bluth patriarch, George, is a real estate developer, and his dysfunctional adult children move into a house he built. It is the model \u2014 and only \u2014 home in an Orange County, Calif. subdivision that was started but abandoned on George\u2019s arrest for fraud. A fake chateau, the house stands forlorn on a muddy plot.",
        "Sparks flew the night Oarhe Akhigbe and Nicole Battle met. Literally. In late November 2013, while sitting next to a fireplace at the Eighteenth Street Lounge, the two, who had been introduced earlier, became rapt in conversation after discovering a mutual interest in reggae. But after a few minutes, Nicole noticed an odor, like something was burning. She looked down and discovered that the bottom of Oarhe\u2019s pant leg had caught on fire. \u201cYou\u2019re smoking!\u201d said Nicole, 33, a lawyer in the U. S. District Attorney\u2019s Office.",
        "President Trump began recasting America\u2019s role in the global economy Monday, canceling an agreement for a sweeping trade deal with Asia that he once called a \u201cpotential disaster. \u201d Trump signed the executive order formally ending the United States\u2019 participation in the Partnership in the Oval Office after discussing American manufacturing with business leaders in the Roosevelt Room. The order was largely symbolic \u2014 the deal was already essentially dead in Congress \u2014 but served to signal that Trump\u2019s tough talk on trade during the campaign will carry over to his new administration.",
        "President Trump instituted a hiring freeze Monday, signing a presidential memorandum that would affect a large swath of the government but leave wide latitude for exemptions for those working in the military, national security and public safety. The move \u2014 coming on the new president\u2019s first full working day in the White House represents the opening salvo in what could be the most concerted effort to overhaul the federal workforce in 35 years.",
        "On Monday morning, a liberal watchdog group filed a lawsuit against President Trump, alleging he\u2019d violated a previously obscure provision in the Constitution, the \u201cEmoluments Clause. \u201d The watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said that the clause prohibits businesses from accepting payments from foreign governments. They asked a court to stop Trump\u2019s businesses from taking them now. \u201cThis cannot be allowed,\u201d the group wrote in its legal complaint.",
        "White House press secretary Sean Spicer acknowledged Monday that there were some problems with the explanation he gave over the weekend for why he considers President Trump\u2019s inauguration audience the largest ever, but he continued to stand by the assertion. Spicer said figures he provided Saturday about the number of trips taken on Metro during the inauguration were at odds with numbers provided by the Metro system itself. He said the numbers he used were not made up but were given to him by the Presidential Inaugural Committee, which received them from an \u201coutside agency.",
        "Mike Pompeo was confirmed as CIA director by the Senate on Monday, putting the conservative Kansas congressman in charge of an agency that is bracing for its most contentious relationship with the White House in decades. As CIA director, Pompeo will be responsible for managing a global spying network at a time of escalating security problems, including renewed aggression from Russia, the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and the splintering terror threat posed by the Islamic State.",
        "It matters that the crowd for the Women\u2019s March on Washington was far bigger than that for President Trump\u2019s inauguration. The new president often boasts of having started a great movement. Let it be the one that was born with Saturday\u2019s massive protests. If size is important, and apparently to Trump it is, there was no contest. The Metro transit system recorded 1, 001, 613 trips on the day of the protest, the ridership in history \u2014 surpassed only by ridership for President Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration in 2009.",
        "This is probably as close as we\u2019ll get to a mea culpa in Trump World. White House press secretary Sean Spicer came out for his first official briefing Monday afternoon resembling not at all the madman who unleashed his fury from the same podium Saturday evening. He smiled. He didn\u2019t shout. His suit fit. The lectern had been lowered so he could see over it. And he took questions \u2014 not just from friendly outlets but from American Urban Radio (which has an African American audience) and Univision, the Hispanic network Donald Trump disparaged on the campaign.",
        "If blue states think they\u2019re going to be shielded from the coming Trump tsunami, they\u2019re sorely mistaken. Much has been written about how the unified Republican front in Washington is going to betray the whites of Trump country. The coming Obamacare repeal, fewer worker protections and additional fraying of the safety net will inflict enormous pain. Blue states might appear to be relatively insulated from much of this turmoil, since they\u2019ve already locked in many of the progressive policies Republicans aim to roll back at the federal level.",
        "Sean Spicer is the appropriate face of the new Trump administration. He is the White House press secretary, the spokesman and all of that, and he came into the briefing room on Saturday wearing the blank expression of Laurence Harvey after turning over the queen of diamonds in The Manchurian Candidate. ? You ve heard of a molotov cocktail. Spicer was wearing a molotov face. Vyacheslav Molotov was Joseph Stalin s foreign minister.",
        "One of the main reasons that Donald Trump gets greeted by \u201cHail to the Chief\u201d is the particularly loyal support of white evangelical Christian voters. As a result of Trump\u2019s election, conservative Christians (a larger group than evangelicals, but including most of them) will see fewer trespasses on institutional religious liberty from the executive branch. They will be able to support judges more amenable to their rights. They will be welcomed at the White House and have access to the president. And they are in grave spiritual danger. In America, we have no state religion."
