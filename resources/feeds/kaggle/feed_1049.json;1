        "ON TUESDAY the Senate Judiciary Committee will consider President Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions ( . ). As with any potential Justice Department leader, a primary question is whether Mr. Sessions will defend the separation between White House political interests and Justice Department which should recognize no interest beyond fairly enforcing the law. At a hearing this month, Mr. Sessions bolstered his promise to maintain the Justice Department\u2019s credibility by pledging to recuse himself from decisions relating to Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server or the Clinton Foundation. This was welcome: The statements Mr.",
        "After years of development, protest and regulatory red tape, the first genetically modified, apples will soon go on sale in the United States. The fruit, sold sliced and marketed under the brand Arctic Apple, could hit a cluster of Midwestern grocery stores as early as Feb. 1. The limited release is an early test run for the controversial apple, which has been genetically modified to eliminate the browning that occurs when an apple is left out in the open air.",
        "Four Senate Republicans introduced a plan on Monday that promises states a buffet of options for providing health insurance, including keeping their Affordable Care Act exchanges. The proposal, sponsored by Sens. Bill Cassidy ( .) Susan Collins ( ) Shelley Moore Capito, ( . Va.) and Johnny Isakson ( .) comes as Republican leaders are under pressure to explain how they will prevent more than 20 million people from losing insurance if the GOP makes good on plans to repeal former president Barack Obama\u2019s signature law.",
        "Twitter lit up with jokes and memes during inauguration weekend, but there was one topic that really sent social media into a frenzy: Barron Trump. President Trump\u2019s son attracted a lot of attention Friday when he appeared on TV, frequently captured on camera as he sat behind his father at the inauguration ceremony at the U. S Capitol. Some Twitter users placed him in unflattering memes; other users immediately took such jokes to task, considering they involved a kid who didn\u2019t ask to be in the spotlight, and children in the first family are supposed to be .",
        "Senate Democrats are formally asking Sen. Lamar Alexander ( .) to have a second confirmation hearing for Betsy DeVos, President Trump\u2019s education nominee, arguing that they need an opportunity to further scrutinize her potential conflicts of interests and preparedness to lead the Education Department. \u201cEducation is too important an issue, and the Secretary of Education is too important a position for the country and for this Committee, to jam a nominee through without sufficient questioning and scrutiny,\u201d they wrote to Alexander in a letter Monday.",
        "A father and son accused of raping a teenage girl over a period and keeping her shackled in a basement have made it clear that they don\u2019t have faith in the law or in the people who practice it. When they face an Ohio jury as they defend themselves against criminal charges that carry long prison sentences, they will rely on one book: The Bible. Timothy Ciboro and his son, Esten Ciboro, both of Toledo, are each charged with multiple counts of rape.",
        "Speaker? Professor? Author? Board member? Owner of a professional basketball team? Those are among the job prospects being bandied about for Barack Obama\u2019s time . All receive an annual pension of $205, 700 annually, which is pegged to inflation. And Obama\u2019s kicked in on Jan. 20. They also receive federal money for offices and administrative help. Beyond that, they are on their own.",
        "A new report, released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on the last day of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, presents a series of updated estimates for future rise, both in the United States and worldwide. It suggests that, under extreme future climate change, global sea levels could rise by more than eight feet by the end of the century \u2014 one of the highest estimates yet to be presented in a federal report.",
        "While most people were focused on the fallout of White House press secretary Sean Spicer\u2019s fiery first media briefing, the A. V. Club was busy unearthing news of a different sort: that Spicer had been \u201cwaging a quiet, Twitter feud\u201d for years with none other than Dippin\u2019 Dots, the ice cream.",

        "Trump administration officials instructed employees at multiple agencies in recent days to cease communicating with the public through news releases, official social media accounts and correspondence, raising concerns that federal employees will be able to convey only information that supports the new president\u2019s agenda. The new limits on public communications appear to be targeting agencies that are charged with overseeing environmental and scientific policy, prompting criticism from officials within the agencies and from outside groups focused on climate change.",
        "President Trump signed executive orders Tuesday to revive the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines, another step in his effort to dismantle former president Barack Obama\u2019s environmental legacy. He also signed an executive order to expedite environmental reviews of other infrastructure projects, lamenting the existing \u201cincredibly cumbersome, long, horrible permitting process. \u201d \u201cThe regulatory process in this country has become a mess,\u201d he said. It remained unclear how Trump\u2019s order would expedite those environmental reviews. Many are statutory and the legislation that created them cannot be swept aside by an executive order.",
        "South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley was confirmed Tuesday to become the next U. S. ambassador to the United Nations, placing a rising Republican political star in charge of advancing President Trump\u2019s agenda in an institution whose effectiveness he has questioned. She will step down from her post in South Carolina to take one of the country\u2019s highest profile diplomatic jobs and one that would burnish her resume for higher office later. Haley, who has no formal diplomatic experience, won significant Democratic support.",
        "Donald Trump meant what he said about trade. When he isn\u2019t getting attention for telling demonstrable falsehoods about the size of his inauguration crowd, Trump has been busy filling his administration with people who want to get tough on China, threatening to put tariffs on companies that outsource jobs, and, as he did on Monday, pulling the United States out of big trade deals. Indeed, he officially killed the Partnership, and is expected to announce that he wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement as well. How much does this matter?",
        "President Trump had just returned to the White House on Saturday from his final inauguration event, a tranquil interfaith prayer service, when the flashes of anger began to build. Trump turned on the television to see a jarring juxtaposition \u2014 massive demonstrations around the globe protesting his presidency and footage of the sparser crowd at his inauguration, with large patches of white empty space on the Mall. As his press secretary, Sean Spicer, was still unpacking boxes in his spacious new West Wing office, Trump grew increasingly and visibly enraged. Pundits were dissing his turnout.",
        "\u201cI think there have been studies; there was one that came out of Pew in 2008 that showed 14 percent of people who have voted were not citizens. There are other studies that were presented to him. \u201d \u2014 White House press secretary Sean Spicer, news briefing, Jan. 24, 2017 Spicer cited repeatedly debunked research to support Trump\u2019s claim that millions of people voted illegally during the 2016 presidential election. These studies do not support Trump\u2019s claims of \u201cmillions\u201d of people voting illegally \u2014 as we\u2019ve covered here, here, here, here and here.",
        "Technically, the proper way to describe claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2016 election is to state that there\u2019s no evidence that it happened. Shortly after the election, we tallied up reports of voter fraud that occurred last year and found a grand total of four examples. There is no evidence that there was fraud at any significant scale at all. Saying this, that there\u2019s no evidence, is a hedge. We say it just in case somehow there emerges evidence that, indeed, hundreds of people registered to vote illegally and went to cast ballots.",
        "FBI Director James B. Comey was among the senior U. S. officials who had the unpleasant task of traveling to Trump Tower last month to inform the that Russia had interfered in the election process to help him win office. Then Comey asked his colleagues \u2014 including the CIA director \u2014 to step outside so that he could discuss something even more awkward: a dossier in wide circulation in Washington that alleged that Moscow had gathered compromising financial, political and personal material about the incoming U. S. president. That Comey was asked after that encounter, described by U. S.",

        "Of all the surprises from the Oscar nominations released this morning, none was bigger than the fact that Mel Gibson and \u201cHacksaw Ridge\u201d cleaned up, grabbing nods for best picture, director, actor and three other categories. Hollywood, it seems, has forgiven Mel Gibson. Forgiven him for what? Well, let\u2019s think back over the past decade or so, shall we? There was the 2006 DUI arrest, during which he referred to a female officer crudely and asked another whether he was Jewish, since Jews \u201cwere responsible for all the wars in the world.",

And that everybody should be treated with a sense of their own dignity. \u201d Individual dignity has been a longtime focus of inquiry and study for Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute. And the loss of said dignity among Americans gave him insight into what made Donald Trump the 45th president of the United States.",
        "I apologize to Donald Trump. As Sean Spicer so wisely said at his first news conference on Monday (It was the first. The one that happened on Saturday did not happen at all, and I recognize that!) it is unfair to be so mean and negative all the time. Here is the fair and unbiased story about the inauguration written in compliance with the Trump style guidelines that we should have been obeying all along. Nothing that has ever happened or will ever happen was as great as Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.",
        "Terrell Jermaine Starr is a senior reporter for Foxtrot Alpha, a blog that covers defense, technology and policy. There\u2019s a reason why some of President Trump\u2019s supporters don\u2019t fear Russian President Vladimir Putin: Racism is altering their perceptions of what a threat is and isn\u2019t, even at the international level. The intelligence community has presented Trump evidence that Russia hacked our election, yet he insisted on condemning the findings. He even suggested via Twitter that sworn members of the intelligence community were behaving like \u201cNazi Germany. \u201d Trump supporters should have been appalled, but many aren\u2019t.",

        "Ashton Sanders in \u201cMoonlight. \u201d (David ) Redemption \u2014 or at least a whiff of it \u2014 was in the air on Tuesday when nominations for the 89th Academy Awards were announced. Whether in the form of records being broken or milestones being reached, the prevailing mood was one of forward progression for an industry that loves nothing more than a great comeback story \u2014 especially its own. That sense of cockeyed optimism propelled the day\u2019s most recognized movie, \u201cLa La Land,\u201d which with 14 nominations tied \u201cAll About Eve\u201d and \u201cTitanic\u201d for a record number of nods.",
        "JERUSALEM \u2014 Israel announced a bold plan on Tuesday to construct 2, 500 housing units in Jewish settlements in the West Bank, a decision made by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu just two days after he spoke with President Trump. The move appears to be a clear sign that the Israelis no longer fear American criticism of settlement construction, which is condemned by most of the world. For eight years, Netanyahu and his allies bristled at the harsh condemnations of settlement growth by the Obama administration, which referred to the Israeli communities as \u201cillegitimate\u201d and \u201can obstacle to peace.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m a very big person when it comes to the environment.

        "In the weeks leading up to President Trump\u2019s inauguration, a small group of activists threatening to disrupt the event was trying to keep the details secret. D.

        "Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said Tuesday that he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer, following a fainting spell the night before during his State of the State address. The governor fainted Monday night, slurring his words and then striking his head on a lectern as he fell to the floor. His staffers caught him, and legislators immediately adjourned the meeting at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul.
