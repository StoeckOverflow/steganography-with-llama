        "President Trump vowed as a candidate to take a sledgehammer to the federal bureaucracy, put a workforce full of \u201cwaste, fraud and abuse\u201d on notice and \u201ccut so much, your head will spin. \u201d But the \u201cacross the board\u201d hiring freeze he put in place Monday could be a more symbolic, less forceful first step toward shrinking government than the sweeping order it appears to be, federal personnel experts said Tuesday. In fact, the memorandum regarding the 2. 1 million civilians in the federal workforce leaves plenty of room for exceptions.",
        "Five Washington Post staff members have each embarked on a different program to change our eating habits. Three weeks ago, we each outlined our diet of choice, explaining the whys and hows \u2014 along with our expectations of the challenges to come. Since then, we\u2019ve been sharing weekly updates on our progress, including the obstacles, stumbles and victories. We\u2019re sharing daily food diaries and, of course, reports of any weight loss \u2014 if that\u2019s what we\u2019re after. [5 diets, a single resolution to eat better in the new year.",
        "The lure of the recipe seems irresistible. Short list means simple, right? With a possible three out of five already in your pantry. That single recipe subcategory accounts for a lot of scrolling through the websites of All Recipes, Eating Well, Good Housekeeping and Rachael Ray, Southern Living, Food Network \u2014 you name it. I am scratching my head about this, though, because I see recipes that should have asterisks. They are the culinary equivalent of fake news. With notable exceptions, the recipes don\u2019t count water, basic seasonings, oil. Why?",
        "April 2016 \u2014 Pittsburgh (Jabin Washington Post) On Friday, Donald Trump became the nation\u2019s 45th president. While the transition of power took only a matter of minutes, Trump\u2019s road to the White House was much longer. From before his New Hampshire primary until a visit to a church on the morning of his inauguration, Washington Post photographer Jabin Botsford followed the businessman and reality TV show star\u2019s path to the nation\u2019s highest office. Botsford cultivated relationships with the campaign and supporters alike. He attended rallies in dozens of states, focusing on potential voters.",
        "President Trump signed a pair of executive actions Wednesday to begin ramping up immigration enforcement, including a new border wall with Mexico, vowing that construction on his chief campaign pledge would begin in months. In an appearance at the Department of Homeland Security, Trump kicked off the rollout of a series of directives aimed at clamping down on the estimated 11 million immigrants living illegally in the United States. Aides said more directives could come later this week, including new restrictions on refugees and immigrants from countries.",
        "President Trump\u2019s plans to ask for a \u201cmajor investigation\u201d into allegations of widespread voter fraud were met with skepticism by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers \u2014 and fear from voting rights advocates that the president will use his unfounded claims to justify voting laws. It is unclear who will investigate Trump\u2019s belief that he lost the popular vote in November\u2019s election because millions of illegal votes were cast. The president could set up an independent commission or task force to look into the claims, which have already been disproved by many national studies.",
        "There is no benign explanation for President Trump\u2019s false assertion that millions of people voted illegally in the last election. It is either a deliberate attempt to undermine faith in the democratic process, an exhortation to those who favor new restrictions on access to the ballot box or the worrisome trait of someone with immense power willing to make wild statements without any credible evidence. By repeating as president what he had said as a candidate, for whatever purpose, Trump is now striking at the foundation of a democratic society.",
        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Republicans eagerly seeking answers from President Trump on how he plans to implement his agenda instead found themselves deflecting new questions Wednesday about the president\u2019s latest controversial pronouncements. House and Senate Republicans began the week expecting specific guidance on what will replace the Affordable Care Act, how quickly taxes might get slashed and how the government will pay for a new border wall and infrastructure plan. But on Wednesday, Trump offered up a fresh set of distractions with a flurry of announcements and tweets. He signed executive orders designed to construction of a wall along the U.",
        "Team Trump believes in the power of image. The new president believes that a single photograph, ad nauseam, can form the basis of a narrative. He believes the actors in his White House drama should look the part, whether patriotic or powerful. Fashion is costuming. In a striking case of character assassination by tailoring, Sean Spicer, the president\u2019s freshly appointed press secretary, stepped to the podium over the weekend for a briefing that disappointed the president, The Washington Post later reported.",
        "An executive order apparently drafted by the Trump administration calls for a policy review that could authorize the CIA to reopen \u201cblack site\u201d prisons overseas and potentially restart an interrogation program that was dismantled in 2009 after using methods widely condemned as torture. The document, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post, would revoke former president Barack Obama\u2019s decision to end the CIA program and require national security officials to evaluate whether the agency should resume interrogating terrorism suspects.",
        "Mary Tyler Moore, whose comic timing and beauty made her a leading TV star and Emmy actress before she took on dramatic roles in films, and whose 1970s situation comedy about the life of a professional single woman was considered a cultural and feminist milestone, died on Jan. 25 at a hospital in Greenwich, Conn. She was 80. Mara Buxbaum, a representative of Ms. Moore, announced the death in a statement.",
        "Donald Trump, we have long known, is a weapon of mass distraction. He detonates daily, or more often. But now that he is president, the fallout is dangerous. Just after noon on Tuesday, alarming news began to spread that the Trump administration was imposing a gag order on the agencies of the federal government. The Environmental Protection Agency, the Agriculture Department, the Interior Department and the Department of Health and Human Services all reported various new edicts restricting federal agencies\u2019 use of social media, appearances in public events or contacts with the press or lawmakers.",
        "\u201cFor too long, a small group in our nation\u2019s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. \u201d \u2014 President Trump, Jan. 20 Washington is not a swamp. Since at least the days of Jimmy Carter, presidential politicians have run against Washington, which is \u2014 according to the standard indictment \u2014 overrun by corrupt politicians, overpaid lobbyists and media types.",
        "The news Wednesday that Mary Tyler Moore had died at 80 felt like a continuation of the grimmest trends of 2016, the death of important artists precisely at the moment when we needed their voices. Moore\u2019s loss the week after women\u2019s marches around the world announced a resurgent feminist sensibility in the face of a sexist\u2019s election to the U. S. presidency feels particularly bittersweet.",
        "Did the phony, hypocritical liberal celebrities who made fools of themselves during the 2016 campaign not get the memo? I am specifically referring to all the useful analysis that should have clued them in to how little their opinions mattered in the political realm, and what their utility might be in the future. Even back in 2014, a CBS News poll showed that 61 percent of Americans thought Hollywood had \u201ctoo much influence on American politics and social values.",

        "CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper provided the best evisceration of President Trump\u2019s claim that massive voter fraud, namely millions of illegal immigrants casting votes, threw the popular vote to Hillary Clinton: The media, understandably, try to understand why Trump would tell such an easily debunked falsehood. Why lie when he is president anyway, by virtue of the electoral college? Why get this badly off track? Other Republicans are not going down his road to oblivion, despite years of beating the bushes looking for fraud as the basis for passing voter ID laws.",
        "The Dow Jones industrial average blew past the 20, 000 threshold for the first time in trading Wednesday, propelled by President Trump\u2019s calls for massive infrastructure spending, lower corporate taxes and regulatory rollbacks and the theme defining his first days in office. U. S. markets advanced across the board Wednesday. The closely watched Standard & Poor\u2019s index and Nasdaq were up less than 1 percent. And as the Dow closed at 20, 068, it notched the gain since the bubble of 1999.",
        "Donald Trump may not be a big reader, but he\u2019s been a boon for sales of dystopian literature. Amid our thirst for adult coloring books and stories about missing girls and reincarnated puppies, some grim old classics are speaking to us with new urgency. Ray Bradbury\u2019s \u201cFahrenheit 451\u201d Aldous Huxley\u2019s \u201cBrave New World \u201d and Margaret Atwood\u2019s \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale \u201d have all risen up the latest paperback bestseller list. But by far the greatest beneficiary of our newly piqued national anxiety is George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984.",
        "Muhammad Ashraf, president of Nationwide Chauffeured Services in Alexandria, Va. didn\u2019t support Donald Trump during the 2016 election. That doesn\u2019t mean he wanted a car in his nearly fleet torched by protesters during the inauguration. In a protest at 13th and K streets in Northwest Washington, Ashraf\u2019s limo \u2014 a stretch model valued at $90, 000, he said \u2014 was destroyed. First, protesters smashed the windows, forcing the car\u2019s driver to flee. Then, the car was with an anarchy symbol and the slogan \u201cWe the People.",
        "Nebraska State Sen. Bill Kintner stood before reporters on Wednesday morning and called himself a \u201cfighter. \u201d Kintner, who had previously been involved in a cybersex scandal, this month drew criticism for an offensive retweet about the Women\u2019s March, which appeared to joke about the issue of sexual assault. At the news conference, Kintner, a Republican, said that he had received emails, calls and text messages asking him to stay and continue his work in the state government.",
        "SEOUL \u2014 The diplomat\u2019s decision to defect from a regime he had spent his whole life defending did not happen overnight. Instead, his misgivings had been simmering for two decades, even as he went around Europe espousing the superiority of the North Korean system. They finally reached a boiling point when Thae realized that this regime, to which he had been so loyal, expected him to lie to his children.",
        "Bana used her riveting Twitter account to give the world a glimpse into Syria, amassing hundreds of thousands of followers along the way. Now that the Syrian girl has the world\u2019s attention, she\u2019s appealing to the new U. S. president to \u201cdo something for the children of Syria. \u201d In a letter written to President Trump several days before his inauguration, Bana \u2014 currently living in Turkey after her family escaped Aleppo in December \u2014 requests Trump\u2019s help and promises her friendship in return.",
        "When Jason White walked into Busboys and Poets Monday morning, a Washington restaurant that promotes social justice, he looked around and told his friend he might want to remove his red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap. The three white Texan men knew they stuck out in a place where art and images cover the walls. And White said he could sense when his waitress greeted them that she knew they did too. But Rosalynd Harris had arrived at work that morning still high off the energy from the Women\u2019s March.",
        "MEXICO CITY \u2014 A deep rift opened Thursday between the United States and its southern neighbor as the Trump administration pressed forward with a plan for a giant border wall and insisted that Mexico would pay for it, possibly through a U. S. tax on imports. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto on Thursday called off a trip to Washington after restating that Mexico would not finance the wall. Hours later, Trump\u2019s spokesman, Sean Spicer, said the wall could be funded by a 20 percent import tax on goods from Mexico.",
        "The chief of the U. S. Border Patrol has resigned after only six months on the job, one day after President Trump announced plans to ratchet up immigration enforcement and build a wall along the U. S. border, officials said Thursday. Officials familiar with the decision said that Morgan \u2014 a career FBI official who was the first outsider to lead the agency responsible for securing the U. S. borders \u2014 was removed by Kevin K. McAleenan, acting commissioner of the U. S. Customs and Border Protection agency.",
        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Congress will pass legislation to remake health care, reform the federal tax system and secure the U. S. border with Mexico by year\u2019s end, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Thursday, confirming that lawmakers intend to aggressively push President Trump\u2019s campaign priorities. But it won\u2019t be in the short time frame that some Republicans \u2014 including President Trump \u2014 first touted. Plans that Ryan ( .) and other congressional leaders presented to lawmakers here Wednesday and Thursday extend beyond the traditional window for a new administration\u2019s top priorities.",
        "When Kellyanne Conway took over as Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign manager in August \u2014 his third in under a year \u2014 there were few signs that Trump would emerge victorious on election night just three months later. He was trailing Hillary Clinton in some polls by 10 points nationally, and the gap was widening in battleground states. Twitter attacks by Trump on Khizr Khan, the father of an American Muslim Army captain killed in Iraq, and his metastasizing list of other Twitter and campaign rally barbs weren\u2019t helping his favorability ratings, particularly among women.",
        "A number of career Foreign Service officers were informed this week that they will not be asked to stay on in senior or sensitive posts that are under direct White House control, creating an unusual leadership vacuum among the top ranks of the State Department. Although the diplomats were not technically fired, the Trump administration opted to remove a number of top officials in charge of the State Department\u2019s 13 divisions responsible for policy and other matters. Officials at the level of assistant secretary and above were affected, the department said.",
        "Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s and one of his closest White House advisers, is registered to vote in both New Jersey and New York, while White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer is on the rolls both in Virginia and his home state of Rhode Island, according to elections officials and voting registration records. Their dual registrations offer two more examples of how common it is for voters to be on the rolls in multiple states something Trump has claimed is evidence of voter fraud."
