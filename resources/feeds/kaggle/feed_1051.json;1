        "LONDON Everybody else was talking about economics. But all through the Brexit referendum campaign and in the months after the vote, I worried about British geopolitics. I worried about Britain\u2019s alliances. I worried that the protracted divorce negotiations between Britain and its closest economic and political partners would create misunderstandings and eventually anger \u2014 and indeed, this is already coming to pass. I also worried that Britain would slowly begin to redefine itself as a country outside the Western alliance.",
        "The Post reports: Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto on Thursday morning canceled his upcoming visit with President Trump amid outrage in Mexico about Trump\u2019s plan to build a border wall and his threats to force Mexico to pay for it. \u2026 Pe\u00f1a Nieto had sent out a recorded message on Wednesday night saying that he \u201cregrets and disapproves\u201d of the U. S. decision to move forward with the wall, but that he still planned to come to Washington next Tuesday to meet with Trump because of the importance of the negotiations.",
        "A new Quinnipiac poll finds that Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating has soared all the way up to 36 percent, while 44 percent of American voters disapprove of his handling of the presidency so far. Now, you\u2019ll be forgiven for thinking that these numbers don\u2019t matter. After all, Trump won the presidency even though he was deeply unpopular and majorities saw him as unfit for the presidency, right? Yes.",
        "Everyone knows that certain jobs are more likely to be held by people of certain genders \u2014 women are more likely to be teachers, for example, and men are more likely to be computer engineers. These trends contribute to a sizable gender salary gap, but they also force a more difficult question: How do these roles form in the first place? Over the past several decades, studies have slowly been chipping away at the theory that the two sexes behave differently primarily due to innate biological differences.",
        "Since President Trump won election last November, some Democrats and pundits have argued that, despite his noxious rhetoric and promises, the new president deserves a chance, either broadly or on specific issues such as trade and infrastructure. Perhaps he would surprise people, and even if he didn\u2019t, Democrats would be hypocrites to obstruct right away after complaining about endless GOP obstruction. January has shown that a Trump presidency will be at least as bad as feared, yet too many Democrats still haven\u2019t adjusted to reality.",
        "Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s job running the State Department just got considerably more difficult. The entire senior level of management officials resigned Wednesday, part of an ongoing mass exodus of senior Foreign Service officers who don\u2019t want to stick around for the Trump era. Tillerson was actually inside the State Department\u2019s headquarters in Foggy Bottom on Wednesday, taking meetings and getting the lay of the land. I reported Wednesday morning that the Trump team was narrowing its search for his No. 2, and that it was looking to replace the State Department\u2019s undersecretary for management, Patrick Kennedy.",
        "For the first time, scientists have grown an embryo that is . The experiment, described Thursday in the journal Cell, involves injecting human stem cells into the embryo of a pig, then implanting the embryo in the uterus of a sow and allowing it to grow. After four weeks, the stem cells had developed into the precursors of various tissue types, including heart, liver and neurons, and a small fraction of the developing pig was made up of human cells.",
        "President Trump again decried the levels of bloodshed in Chicago during a televised interview this week, saying that the problem could be easily solved without elaborating on what he meant. Trump, in his first major television interview since moving into the White House, said that police and city officials were \u201cnot doing the job\u201d and suggested the problem was that they were \u201cbeing overly politically correct.",
        "It\u2019s now 2 \u00bd minutes to \u201cmidnight,\u201d according to the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, which warned Thursday that the end of humanity may be near. The group behind the famed Doomsday Clock announced at a news conference that it was adjusting the countdown to the End of it All by moving the hands 30 seconds closer to midnight \u2014 the closest the clock has been to Doomsday since 1953, after the United States tested its first thermonuclear device, followed months later by the Soviet Union\u2019s hydrogen bomb test.",
        "It turns out there will be a conference in Atlanta next month about climate change and its effects on public health. It just won\u2019t have the federal government behind it. The reason? Former vice president Al Gore. \u201cHe called me and we talked about it and we said, \u2018There\u2019s still a void and still a need.\u2019 We said, \u2018Let\u2019s make this thing happen,\u2019 \u201d said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. \u201cIt was a .",
        "Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski has been on a leave of absence from the bench since undergoing back surgery Jan. 6, but he\u2019s kept a close eye on the Blue Devils during his recovery \u2014 and reportedly hasn\u2019t liked what he\u2019s seen. Citing anonymous sources, ESPN reported Thursday that Krzyzewski held a meeting at his home Tuesday and told players that they were temporarily banned from the locker room and no longer allowed to wear Duke apparel. A source told ESPN that the penalties would last \u201cuntil [the players] start living up to the standards of the Duke program.",
        "We began Wednesday morning with the sight of Greenpeace activists scaling a construction crane in downtown Washington and unfurling a gigantic orange and black banner that bore the message: \u201cRESIST. \u201d We ended the day with several hundred protesters marching to the White House to condemn President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration. Welcome to Trump\u2019s capital. It\u2019s a spectacle a day here. anarchists swarmed through downtown D. C. on Trump\u2019s Inauguration Day, torching a limousine, smashing glass and vandalizing businesses.",
        "When I first married John, I quickly became aware how much he gets seduced by all types of patterns, light and quiet, almost invisible moments that have their own visible magic. And with objects, he\u2019s interested whether they are extraordinary or ordinary. I love to cook. As a Californian, I\u2019m deeply inspired by fruits and vegetables, and my kitchen is a simple and happy place. Sometimes I gather up loads of lemons or find a sale on plums. Maybe squash blossoms from the farmers market or something from my garden.",
        "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Republican lawmakers aired sharp concerns about their party\u2019s quick push to repeal the Affordable Care Act at a meeting Thursday, according to a recording of the session obtained by The Washington Post. The recording reveals a GOP that appears to be filled with doubts about how to make good on a promise to get rid of Obamacare without explicit guidance from President Trump or his administration.",
        "In a private meeting with congressional Republicans this week, Vice President Pence vowed that the Trump administration would pursue a probe of voting rolls in the United States to examine whether millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election as President Trump has charged.",
        "President Trump paid his first visit to the Pentagon as on Friday, signing executive actions subjecting potential immigrants to greater scrutiny and seeking to enhance American military power. Appearing at the Pentagon\u2019s Hall of Heroes, which honors military personnel who have received the Medal of Honor, Trump held up an order he said would establish new measures designed to keep \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d from entering the United States. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here,\u201d he said, flanked by Vice President Pence and Defense Secretary James Mattis.",
        "No one can accuse Donald Trump of campaigning in poetry. But after just one week in the White House, the new president is bumping up against the hard reality of governing in prose. Many of the sweeping actions President Trump vowed this week through his executive orders and proclamations are unlikely to happen, either because they are impractical, opposed by Congress and members of his Cabinet, or full of legal holes.",
        "President Trump said Friday that it is \u201cvery early\u201d to discuss lifting sanctions on Russia, suggesting no action is likely in a Saturday call that will be his first official conversation with Russian President Vladi mir Putin. Trump spoke at a White House news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May, who reaffirmed her support for keeping the sanctions in place until substantive progress has been made toward ending the conflict in Ukraine. She said she would continue to press that argument with other European allies.",
        "MEXICO CITY \u2014 Amid one of the worst crises in U. S. relations in years, President Trump and President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto spoke by phone Friday morning for about an hour, a conversation that Trump said was \u201cvery, very friendly\u201d but one he suggested was a prelude to tough negotiations over what he described as an unfair trade relationship. \u201cWe had a very good call,\u201d Trump said in a joint news conference with visiting British Prime Minister Theresa May. \u201cI have been very strong on Mexico. I have great respect for Mexico. I love the Mexican people.",
        "President Trump said Friday that he continues to believe torture methods can be effective to combat terrorism, but he pledged to defer over whether to implement such tactics to Defense Secretary James N. Mattis, who has opposed them. \u201cHe will override,\u201d Trump said in a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May at the White House. \u201cI\u2019m giving him that power. \u201d During his campaign, Trump had expressed support for enhanced interrogation techniques, in particular simulated drowning known as waterboarding, which was forbidden by the Obama administration.",
        "President Trump\u2019s first week in office has been marked by two things: controversy (over things like his inaugural crowd size and voter fraud accusations) and executive orders. The first is old hat for Trump. But for casual observers \u2014 and even some political junkies who are paying close attention to Trump\u2019s policy moves \u2014 the second might be a little foreign. Trump signed two more executive orders on Friday, attempting to fulfill his promise of \u201cextreme vetting\u201d to keep potential \u201cradial Islamic terrorists\u201d out of the United States. So what is an executive action or executive order?",
        "Thousands of abortion opponents gathered in cold, blustery weather near the Washington Monument Friday and heard Vice President Mike Pence tell the annual March for Life that the Trump administration is determined to advance the fight against abortion. The massive crowd, bearing flags, banners and placards, then flowed down Constitution Avenue, filling the street, and rallied at the Supreme Court building across from the Capitol. \u201cWe will not grow weary,\u201d Pence said in a addresss to the throng at the monument.",
        "The Post\u2019s Mike DeBonis has obtained leaked audio of Republicans at a session airing serious anxieties about the GOP\u2019s strategy to repeal and replace Obamacare. What\u2019s remarkable is how decisively their specific comments in private undercut the party\u2019s public, talking points about the battle to come. Now, to be clear, these private comments reveal Republicans actually wrestling with the policy challenges that repeal (and replace) will create, which is a good thing as far as it goes.",
        "Jason Chaffetz, a Republican, represents Utah\u2019s 3rd Congressional District in the House and is chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Jim DeMint, a former Republican senator from South Carolina, is president of the Heritage Foundation. The D. C. Council last year made a serious error when it passed the Death With Dignity Act, legalizing suicide in the District. Now it is Congress\u2019s duty and constitutional obligation to ensure the act does not stand. Those who argue that the D. C.",
        "Sen. Marco Rubio has a reputation for being a windbag who huffs and puffs but never quite blows anything down. The Florida Republican is relentless, however, when it comes to throwing his weight against the District. Nothing like beating up on someone who can\u2019t fight back. Toward that end, Rubio has reintroduced the Second Amendment Enforcement Act, a bill aimed at gutting the city\u2019s tough requirements, which a federal judge upheld. Rubio\u2019s bill went nowhere when introduced in 2015.",
        "Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher enjoys status among U. S. conservatives \u2014 which may be why former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is trying to summon her to the defense of Donald Trump. It\u2019s not Ronald Reagan, he contends, who serves as the model for what our new president is trying to do \u2014 Trump\u2019s real forebear is Thatcher, who won renown with her crusade against British socialism. \u201cTrump\u2019s inaugural address last Friday had the directness and confrontational tone of a Thatcher speech,\u201d Gingrich writes.",
        "Emily Barbero lives in Minneapolis. In 2012, while expecting our first (and only) child, my husband and I went in for a routine ultrasound. The technician saw something and alerted the resident perinatologist, who alerted the genetics team. We quickly wiped the gel from my belly, and they escorted us down the hall. In the rush, the photos of our baby were left on the printer. Someone probably threw them away long ago.",
        "PRESIDENT TRUMP\u2019S preposterous claims about widespread voter fraud in the 2016 election started when he was a candidate. Declaring the election \u201crigged,\u201d he went so far as to hint he might not accept the outcome if he lost. Winning the election and moving into the White House have not slowed his bogus claims of millions of people voting illegally. Clearly Mr. Trump is rankled that he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton, but more than his pride is at stake.",
        "A pension fund in Cleveland became the first plan to approve benefit cuts for current retirees \u2014 even though it is still years away from running out of cash. The move, some critics say, could open the door for other troubled pension plans to follow suit. The Iron Workers Local 17 Pension fund proposed a plan for extending its lifespan by reducing benefits for workers and retirees. Now that the plan has received final approval, roughly half of the 2, 000 participants will see their pension benefits shrink on Feb. 1.",
        "She hears footsteps from above, shuffling against the attic floorboards. A framed painting suddenly vanishes from a wall. The flames of the chandelier flicker and dim. She is certain it happened \u2014 but her husband assures her that she\u2019s imagining it all. It\u2019s her behavior that seems odd, he insists; perhaps she\u2019s going mad? And, slowly, she begins to believe him. This is the plot of the 1944 Ingrid Bergman film \u201cGaslight."
