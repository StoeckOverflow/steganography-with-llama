And yet, despite years of triage experience, nothing prepared O\u2019Grady \u2014 now an NYU communications professor who teaches graduate students about reputation management \u2014 for the day her own reputation was obliterated online. The reason: O\u2019Grady was mistakenly identified this week as a Secret Service agent (also named Kerry O\u2019Grady) who is under investigation for posting a statement on Facebook that appeared to indicate she preferred jail over being shot and killed for President Trump.",
        "This Super Bowl is, in some ways, all about New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. He is attempting to secure his fifth Super Bowl title in tandem with Coach Bill Belichick, and an NFL season that began with Brady serving his Deflategate suspension imposed by Commissioner Roger Goodell could end with Goodell handing another trophy to the Patriots. But this is a versatile Patriots\u2019 offense that is not all about Brady and the passing game \u2014 at least not all the time.",

        "President Trump\u2019s executive order barring refugees and migrants from predominantly Muslim countries from entry into the United States rippled across the world on Saturday, causing widespread confusion, triggering outrage among immigrant advocates and leading to the detention at U. S. airports of people flying into the country. In addition to blocking all entries from seven countries, including business people, students and others, the ban is also being applied to U. S. legal residents from those nations \u2014 green card holders \u2014 who were traveling abroad at the time the order was signed, federal officials said Saturday.",
        "The country\u2019s leading technology companies are recalling overseas employees and sharply criticizing President Trump after he signed an executive order Friday barring for 90 days immigrants and visitors from seven Muslim countries from entering the United States. The companies warned the action \u2014 which affects immigrants with legal permanent residence status in the United States and also includes suspending the acceptance of refu gees for 120 days \u2014 could impair the ability of America\u2019s top companies to compete. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai late on Friday ordered scores of staffers traveling overseas to return to the United States immediately.",
        "Vice President Pence and Defense Secretary James Mattis stood directly behind their boss Friday, one man on each side, as President Trump announced an order that will ban half the world\u2019s Shiite Muslims from entering the country for months. \u201cI\u2019m establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States,\u201d Trump said from his podium at the Pentagon. \u201cWe don\u2019t want \u2019em here. \u201d Pence nodded along to the words.

        "Several congressional Republicans on Saturday questioned President Trump\u2019s order to halt admission to the U. S. by refugees and citizens of seven countries, even as House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) continued to defend it. Ryan was among the first lawmakers on Friday to back Trump\u2019s order, and his office reiterated his support on Saturday. \u201cThis is not a religious test and it is not a ban on people of any religion,\u201d said spokeswoman AshLee Strong. The order blocks citizens from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Libya from entering the country for at least 90 days.",

S. visa, Labeeb Ali\u2019s hopes of moving to the United States ended abruptly in Qatar\u2019s international airport on Saturday, when officials prevented him from boarding a flight to Texas. \u201cI have the visa in my passport,\u201d he said hours later, after he had stopped yelling at the airport staff and his rage had given way to despair and regret at having already sold his business and belongings in Iraq.",
        "The seven nations targeted for new visitation restrictions by President Trump on Friday all have something in common: They are places he does not appear to have any business interests. The executive order he signed Friday bars all entry for the next 90 days by travelers from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Libya. Excluded from the lists are several nations where the Trump Organization is active and which in some cases have also faced troublesome issues with terrorism.",
        "\u201cThey\u2019ve been horribly treated. Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. \u201d \u2014 President Trump, interview on Christian Broadcasting Network, Jan.",

One of Trump\u2019s directives orders the Joint Chiefs to submit a strategy within 30 days to defeat the Islamic State, signaling that the new president hopes to make good on his campaign promise to more aggressively confront global terrorism than his predecessor. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very successful,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s big stuff.",
        "Ernesto Zedillo, a professor in the field of international economics and politics at Yale University, was president of Mexico from 1994 to 2000. The Mexican government has been courteous toward Donald Trump, as both a candidate and now U. S. president. Indeed, Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has paid a high political cost at home for his being open to working constructively with President Trump. But Pe\u00f1a Nieto has done the right thing by putting the interests of Mexico and the preservation of mutually beneficial relations with our neighbor above his personal popularity.",
        "Week One of the Trump administration was among the most alarming in the history of the American presidency. There have been scarier weeks for the country, certainly \u2014 the Cuban missile crisis and the Sept. 11 attacks. There have been more tragic ones \u2014 the Sept. 11 attacks again, the terrible toll of wartime, the horror of four presidential assassinations. There have been occasions of terrible presidential judgment \u2014 Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s order to detain U. S. citizens and noncitizens of Japanese descent during World War II.",
        "Matt Zeller is a veteran of the war in Afghanistan and the and chief executive of No One Left Behind With his latest executive order and immigration ban, President Trump has shut the door on thousands of foreign interpreters, our wartime allies, who have served alongside our military since 2001. As a combat veteran who has served in the U. S. Army, this action deeply disappoints and angers me. I shouldn\u2019t be alive today.

My role model was ruined this week. For years I have believed, lived and taught people in the Middle East about some of the important virtues of life in the United States of America and what America stood for.

        "President Trump is moving at an unprecedented pace to change the direction of the country and reset America\u2019s place in the world. Amid the many distractions of his first week in office, the president has kept his focus on the ideas that animated his campaign \u2014 most notably immigration and trade \u2014 and on the people who most enthusiastically responded to him. Nowhere has that been more apparent, and with such major implications, than with the indefinite ban on immigration by Syrian refugees and travel restrictions on immigrants from certain countries that he ordered Friday.",
        "MEXICO CITY \u2014 If the trade war is coming, how would Mexico fare? That is the question that has preoccupied politicians and business leaders here since President Trump won the election and began pursuing his agenda to impose tariffs on goods made in Mexico and to build a wall along the border. Trump has made clear his disdain for the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has governed commerce on the continent since 1994, and Mexican leaders have said that if the terms of the renegotiation did not further their interests, they might walk away, as well.",

A few hours later, when her kids were in school, she recorded a voice message and crafted a text alert to blast out to her growing army of activists: and counting. The message went out at 10:15 a. m.: \u201cToday\u2019s daily action is urge your senator to place a \u2018hold\u2019 on Sessions\u2019 AG nomination until Trump shows some respect for the rule of law.",

        "Betsy DeVos, the Michigan billionaire President Trump nominated to be education secretary, wrote a letter to a senator about the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. What she said in that letter is very telling about her education priorities. DeVos wrote the letter to Sen.

        "As many young couples do, my boyfriend and I met during college. We had yet to venture out into the real world and didn\u2019t fully grasp what that entailed, especially in terms of finances. We both graduated in May 2015 and decided the next logical step was to move in together. That was when the reality of being adults set in.

        "President Trump on Sunday defended his executive order banning refugees, migrants and foreign nationals from seven mostly Muslim countries from entering the United States but offered little clarity amid the chaos of legal challenges and national protests. In a statement issued by the White House late Sunday, the president compared his order to action taken by Obama in 2011 to give new scrutiny to visas for Iraqi refugees, though by almost any measure Trump\u2019s order was far more sweeping. \u201cTo be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting,\u201d Trump said in the statement."
