        "Though cast as measures meant to make the country safe, the Trump administration\u2019s moves during its first week in office are more likely to weaken the counterterrorism defenses the United States has erected over the past 16 years, several current and former U. S. officials said. Through inflammatory rhetoric and hastily drawn executive orders, the administration has alienated allies, including Iraq, provided propaganda fodder to terror networks that frequently portray U. S. involvement in the Middle East as a religious crusade, and endangered critical cooperation from often hidden U. S.",
        "Jihadist groups on Sunday celebrated the Trump administration\u2019s ban on travel from seven countries, saying the new policy validates their claim that the United States is at war with Islam. Comments posted to State social media accounts predicted that President Trump\u2019s executive order would persuade American Muslims to side with the extremists. One posting hailed the U. S. president as \u201cthe best caller to Islam,\u201d while others predicted that Trump would soon launch a new war in the Middle East.",
        "President Trump\u2019s executive order to ban entry to the United States to citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries has been roundly criticized by the international community and Democrats, who allege it amounts to a religious test even a thinly veiled \u201dMuslim ban.\u201d There have also been numerous implementation headaches, with two judges halting deportations of those denied entry. And some Republicans are speaking out against Trump, too albeit to varying degrees. Below, we break down who has gone on the record for, against or somewhat in the middle on Trump\u2019s executive order.",
        "INDIAN WELLS, Calif. \u2014 Leaders of the influential Koch network on Sunday expressed opposition to President Trump\u2019s ban on refugees and immigrants from countries, saying the executive order is not in keeping with their aims to build a free and open society. \u201cWe believe it is possible to keep Americans safe without excluding people who wish to come here to contribute and pursue a better life for their families,\u201d said Brian Hooks, the president of the Charles Koch Foundation, who is a weekend conference of donors who help finance the Koch operation.",
        "\u201cMy policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months. \u201d \u2014 President Trump, statement on executive order, Jan. 29, 2017 In justifying his controversial executive order halting travelers from seven countries, President Trump claimed that President Barack Obama did the same thing in 2011. But the comparison is a bit facile. Here\u2019s what happened in 2011.",
        "Thousands of demonstrators rallied outside the White House and in cities nationwide Sunday to protest President Trump\u2019s refu gee ban, as the executive order continued to halt travel in some locations, despite being partially lifted by federal judges overnight. In addition to Washington, large protests took place in New York, Philadelphia, Boston and Atlanta, and at airports in more than 30 cities. In Washington, swarms of protesters amassed in front of the White House by 1 p. m. and by late afternoon the crowds proceeded to the nearby Trump International Hotel and U. S. Capitol.",
        "Remember the name. Remember the face. Thank you, U. S. District Judge Ann Donnelly. #ACLU #MuslimBan @realDonaldTrump don\u2019t attack her. pic. twitter. \u2014 Bill Marler (@bmarler) January 29, 2017 Ann M. Donnelly waited half a year for her chance to convince the Senate that she would make a good federal judge. When the day finally came, she packed as many relatives as she could into the benches. In her opening comments, she named every single one of them. Donnelly introduced the senators to her husband, Michael. Her sister Sarah and brother Thomas.",
        "Donald Trump is who we thought he was. The 45th president campaigned as a radical break from both politics and policy as usual in Washington, promising to restore strength to the White House and the country while ignoring all tradition and political correctness.",
        "Former New York mayor Rudy W. Giuliani said President Trump wanted a \u201dMuslim ban\u201d and requested he assemble a commission to show him \u201dthe right way to do it legally.\u201d Giuliani, an early Trump supporter who once had been rumored for a cabinet position in the new administration, appeared on Fox News late Saturday night to describe how Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily banning refugees came together. Trump on Friday signed orders not only to suspend admission of all refugees into the United States for 120 days but also to implement \u201cnew vetting measures\u201d to screen out \u201cradical Islamic terrorists.",
        "Sahar Algonaimi was planning to stay in the United States for only one week. Her mother was undergoing surgery. Algonaimi, a Syrian citizen, left Saudi Arabia on Friday. When she landed in Chicago the next day, she turned over her passport. She showed officials a doctor\u2019s letter about the procedure. She told them that she had lived in Riyadh for more than 30 years.",
        "CAIRO \u2014 The photos of the Sharef family spoke volumes about their plight. In the first two, the Iraqis are happily seated on their plane, smiling. They were flying from their home in Irbil to New York. In the next few, they are seated in Cairo\u2019s airport, their faces glum and haggard. By then, they had been taken off their plane \u2014 and informed they could no longer travel to the United States. It did not matter that they had valid visas. It did not matter that they were headed to Nashville to start a new life.",
        "Hamid Kargaran was pacing in his San Francisco living room Sunday, not watching the news, trying to stay positive, waiting for his wife to call from Iran. She was due to leave for the airport within the hour, hoping that this time she wouldn\u2019t be prevented from boarding a plane back home. \u201cWe\u2019re not letting ourselves even think that we won\u2019t see each other again,\u201d said Kargaran, 33. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe this is happening in America. \u201d Kargaran is a U. S. citizen, and a successful one.",
        "NAIROBI \u2014 On Friday morning, Abdi Rizack received the news he had waited 20 years for. His application to be resettled in the United States had been accepted. His flight had been booked. On Feb. 6, his itinerary said, he would be on his way to Columbus, Ohio. It was there on a document from the International Organization for Migration, next to the words \u201cPort of Final Destination. \u201d \u201cIt was news that changed our lives. I gave up my heart to the U. S.,\u201d he said. Rizack, 32, did not know how to channel the excitement.",
        "President Trump prides himself on being a negotiator. His candidacy, and now his presidency, have relied on that premise. He says he\u2019ll \u201cforce the Iranians back to the bargaining table\u201d on the nuclear deal; after scrapping the Partnership, he\u2019ll secure bilateral trade deals with Pacific Rim countries and renegotiate NAFTA\u2019s terms; Mexico, he insists, \u201cwill pay for the wall, believe me \u2014 100 percent. \u201d Never one to underpromise, last year he told one reporter: \u201cPeace all over the world would be the best deal. And I think I would know how to do it better than anybody else.",
        "Donald Trump is an avowed capitalist; Hugo Ch\u00e1vez was a socialist with communist dreams. One builds skyscrapers, the other expropriated them. But politics is only policy: The other, darker half is rhetoric. Sometimes the rhetoric takes over. Such has been our lot in Venezuela for the past two decades \u2014 and such is yours now, Americans. Because in one regard, Trump and Ch\u00e1vez are identical. They are both masters of populism. The recipe for populism is universal. Find a wound common to many, find someone to blame for it, and make up a good story to tell.",
        "As a Democratic Senate aide for the past seven years, I had a seat to an impressive show of obstruction. Republicans, under Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, decided they would oppose President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid at every turn to limit their power. And it worked: They extorted concessions from Democrats with threats of shutdowns, fiscal cliffs and financial chaos. I know firsthand that Democrats\u2019 passion for responsible governance can be exploited by Republicans who are willing to blow past all norms and standards. Now we have a president who exemplifies that willingness in the extreme.",
        "\u201cAnybody know who Phil Ochs is?\u201d Lady Gaga called out to her audience at a free concert last summer during the Democratic National Convention. Her setlist that day was eclectic: from the Beatles to Edith Piaf to her own gay rights anthem, \u201cBorn This Way. \u201d But her decision to perform Ochs\u2019s \u201cThe War Is Over,\u201d a 1967 folk song about Vietnam, was particularly surprising. It isn\u2019t often that Ochs, who died four decades ago and is mostly unknown to those born since the 1970s, gets even a brief moment of mainstream recognition.",
        "When reporter William W. Price came to Washington from South Carolina in 1895, there was no such thing as a White House beat. Then Price, working for the Washington Evening Star, began calling himself a \u201cWhite House correspondent\u201d and getting stories about President Grover Cleveland, and a beat was born. Today, White House reporters are promising to hold the new president, like his predecessors, to account. But relations are tense, fueled partly by the administration\u2019s desire to weaken a group it has called an \u201copposition party\u201d and partly by misunderstandings about the beat. Here are five stubborn ones.",
        "Facing growing criticism for failing to mention Jews in a statement marking the Holocaust, the Trump administration on Sunday doubled down on the controversial decision. In a statement on Friday, President Trump broke with the bipartisan practice of past presidents by failing to include any mention of the views that fueled the Holocaust and left 6 million Jews and millions of others dead. \u201cI don\u2019t regret the words,\u201d said White House chief of staff Reince Priebus when asked to defend the statement on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday.",
        "A U. S. Special Operations service member died of injuries suffered during a weekend raid against militants in Yemen, the military said Sunday. Three other American troops, members of a Navy SEAL unit, were wounded in the operation on Saturday against in the Arabian Peninsula. The militant organization has remained a potent threat amid an extended civil war in Yemen. The incident marks the first time a member of the U. S. military has died in combat since President Trump took office a little more than a week ago.",
        "A crowd of teachers, parents and children gathered near the U. S. Capitol on Sunday to protest Betsy DeVos\u2019s nomination to be education secretary, calling the Michigan billionaire a threat to public education and urging the Senate to reject her. Using drums and noisemakers, the group of protesters chanted \u201cToss DeVos\u201d \u201cBetsy is a \u201d and \u201cA, B, C, D, E, F, G, Betsy DeVos is not for me. \u201d Similar protests took place over the weekend in Portland, Ore.; Nashville; and Holland, Mich.

        "The last time Mikhail Gorbachev made American news, the former Soviet dictator sounded upbeat. Of the incoming President Trump, he told the Associated Press in December: \u201dHe has little political experience, but, maybe it\u2019s good.\u201d Of his successor, autocratic Russian President Vladmir Putin: \u201dHe is a strong person,\u201d the Gorbachev said. \u201dTogether, they could lead the world\u201d to peace, he told the reporter, and sang a song after the interview. Putin and Trump both have called for stronger nuclear weapons in their countries since then. Now Gorbachev is back in the press \u2014 warning of possible global war.",
        "JERUSALEM On Saturday evening, Israel\u2019s Prime Minister tweeted his praise of President Trump\u2019s decision to build a wall along the U. S. border with Mexico. \u201dPresident Trump is right,\u201d Netanyahu wrote. \u201dI built a wall along Israel\u2019s southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\u201d He accompanied the tweet with emoji flags of Israel and the United States. President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel\u2019s southern border.

        "Hurtling as we are toward a Trumpian plutocracy, why not take 90 minutes or so to be pleasantly reminded that not all billionaires are just heartless cabinet nominees? In any other context, Peter Kunhardt\u2019s HBO documentary \u201cBecoming Warren Buffett\u201d (airing Monday) would seem like too much of a tongue bath \u2014 a warm portrait that verges on fawning and honors the success, personality quirks and eventual magnanimity of the famous \u201cOracle of Omaha,\u201d who amassed enough billions through seven decades of shrewd investing to buy all of us many times over.",
        "Brunhilde Pomsel, a secretary to Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels who late in life came forward to publicly reflect on, if perhaps not fully reckon with, questions of personal and collective guilt in the face of the Holocaust, died during the night of Jan. 27 at her home in Munich. She was 106. Her death was confirmed by Roland Schrotthofer, a director of \u201cA German Life,\u201d a documentary drawn from dozens of hours of interviews conducted with Ms. Pomsel when she was 103.

        "Rachel Schneider was 13 years old when it happened the first time. She and a few other children had been singing prayers at her Hebrew school when suddenly Schneider felt that something inside her head had gone wrong and that she wasn\u2019t there. Her father brought the terrified girl to an emergency room, where doctors dismissed the episode as a panic attack. They said that Schneider was fine. It happened again while Schneider was on vacation in Quebec City with her parents and sister.",
        "America is all about WINNING these days, according to our new president. And while he may not have been talking about our culinary talent, the United States earned a major accolade yesterday, for the first time ever: American chefs took the gold in the Bocuse d\u2019Or, a top French culinary competition named for legendary French chef Paul Bocuse. It\u2019s basically the Olympics of cooking. The competition is so steep, it makes the cheftestants on \u201cTop Chef\u201d and \u201cChopped\u201d look like burger flippers at McDonald\u2019s.",
        "Whether you\u2019re heading down to Florida for spring break or out to Denver to go skiing, you need to know about one of the worst kinds of tourist traps you could fall into. In Orlando, it\u2019s called State Road 528, also known as the Martin Andersen Beachline Expressway. In Miami, it\u2019s Florida State Road 112, also called the Airport Expressway. In Denver, it\u2019s E which connects the city with its international airport. Not only are these toll roads opportunistically built next to airports, they\u2019re almost entirely cashless, meaning there\u2019s no booth where you can pay your toll.",
        "Acting Attorney General Sally Yates has ordered Justice Department lawyers not to defend challenges to President Trump\u2019s immigration order temporarily banning entry into the United States for citizens of seven countries and refugees from around the world, declaring in a memo Monday she is not convinced the order is lawful. Yates wrote that, as the leader of the Justice Department, she must ensure the department\u2019s position is both \u201clegally defensible\u201d and \u201cconsistent with this institution\u2019s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right.",
        "White House press secretary Sean Spicer had a stern message for State Department employees opposed to President Trump\u2019s executive order banning immigration from seven countries: \u201cEither get with the program or they can go. \u201d Dozens of career diplomats have signed on to a \u201cdissent channel\u201d document, which is a mechanism by which State Department employees can express policy disagreements privately without fear of retribution. The memo has been circulating in the agency and it expresses the view that the immigration ban \u201cwill not achieve its aim of making our country safer."
