        "President Trump\u2019s temporary ban on refugees and other foreigners has significantly deepened fissures in his already fragile relationship with congressional Republicans, as GOP leaders on Capitol Hill complained angrily Monday that they were not consulted before the order was issued. At least a dozen key GOP lawmakers and aides said Trump\u2019s order took them by surprise, even as the White House insisted that it collaborated with Congress. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s political team sought to reassure donors and other supporters that the temporary ban on travelers from seven countries does not amount to a \u201creligious test.",
        "Democrats are doubling down on plans to drag out the confirmation of President Trump\u2019s top Cabinet picks, seizing on a growing public outcry against the president\u2019s ban on certain migrants and refugees to further stall the formation of his new government and Republican legislative plans.",
        "In jagged black strokes, President Trump\u2019s signature was scribbled onto a catalogue of executive orders over the past 10 days that translated the promises of his campaign into the policies of his government. The directives bore Trump\u2019s name, but another man\u2019s fingerprints were also on nearly all of them: Jeff Sessions. The early days of the Trump presidency have rushed a nationalist agenda long on the fringes of American life into action \u2014 and Sessions, the quiet Alabam ian who long cultivated those ideas as a Senate backbencher, has become a singular power in this new Washington.",
        "When they came through the arrivals gate at John F. Kennedy International Airport in 1968, my parents could have been seen as a threat. It was the middle of the Cold War, and my parents \u2014 my mom was 21 and my dad was 23 \u2014 had spent their entire lives behind the Iron Curtain in a communist country. And 1968 was the bloodiest year yet for American troops in a war being fought to contain communism. Nearly 17, 000 Americans died that year in Vietnam.",
        "Former president Barack Obama rejected the idea Monday that President Trump based his immigration executive order on a policy adopted by his own administration, and he endorsed the protests that have been taking place across the country in response to the new restrictions.",
        "Problems entering the United States eased Monday for some international travelers after a weekend of confusion about a travel ban President Trump imposed, but members of Congress said border protection and administration officials still had not answered critical questions. After Rep. Robert C. \u201cBobby\u201d Scott ( .) made a visit to Dulles International Airport on Sunday \u2014 and was denied an audience with Customs and Border Protection officials \u2014 he received a short written response, his staff said Monday.",
        "Two days into President Trump\u2019s new ban on refugees, migrants and foreign nationals from seven countries, there was still mass confusion about the details. On Sunday evening, the White House organized a briefing for reporters with two senior administration officials who agreed to explain the president\u2019s executive order \u2014 but only on the condition of anonymity. One senior administration official explained the ground rules to reporters gathered at the White House and listening on a conference call, then said: \u201cWith that, I\u2019ll turn it over to a senior administration official.",
        "About 4 \u00bd months ago, an attorney representing the administration of Gov. Mike Pence stood in front of what amounted to a judicial firing squad. \u201cYou are so out of it,\u201d U. S. Appeals Court Judge Richard Posner told Indiana Solicitor General Thomas Fisher, who was tasked with defending Pence\u2019s decision to block aid to Syrian refugees coming to the state.",
        "QUEBEC CITY \u201d Gunmen attacked a suburban Quebec City mosque as worshipers were finishing their prayers Sunday night, killing six people and wounding 19 others, five of them critically \u201d a horrific assault that put Canadians on edge, and that government officials immediately labeled an act of terrorism. The S\u00c3\u00bbret\u00c3\u00a9 du Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec, the Quebec provincial police, said two men were arrested Sunday night, though authorities said Monday that only one of the men is now a suspect in the mass shooting at the Quebec Islamic Cultural Center.",
        "Hey, Republicans: Ready to take him literally yet? Two days after the election, I spoke with Grover Norquist, a conservative tax activist who had made peace with the prospect of a Trump presidency. Expressing confidence that Donald Trump wouldn\u2019t attempt the crazier promises made during the campaign, Norquist said Trump\u2019s supporters knew to take him \u201cseriously, but not literally. \u201d Wrong! That hope comforted Republican officeholders and members of the establishment when they reluctantly embraced Trump during the general election. They averted their collective gaze when Trump made scapegoats of minorities, yielded to reckless impulses and exhibited authoritarian tendencies.",
        "John Allen, a retired Marine Corps general who led the international coalition to counter the Islamic State from 2014 to 2015, and Michael O Hanlon are senior fellows at the Brookings Institution. Though he campaigned with the urgent goal of defeating the Islamic State and reasserting American greatness, President Trump has embarked on a policy that could in fact lead to the loss of U. S. influence in Iraq and the worsening of the divide there.",
        "Donald Trump should push the nuclear button. No, not the one that launches actual nuclear weapons. I mean the one that blows up Democratic obstruction to his Supreme Court nominee and puts a reliable conservative on the court to replace justice Antonin Scalia. There is no reason for Trump and Senate Republicans not to go nuclear. Senate Democrats have already made clear their intention to stonewall his nominee, before even knowing whom he plans to nominate on Tuesday night.",
        "In August 2014, the only Yazidi woman in the Iraqi parliament broke down in tears while pleading publicly for the world to save her people from genocide at the hands of the Islamic State. She was due to travel to Washington next week to be honored for her role as a leading human rights activist. But now, along with millions of other innocent people, she is caught up in the Trump administration\u2019s immigration ban. Vian Dakhil was set to receive the Lantos Human Rights Prize at the U. S. Capitol on Feb. 8.",
        "President Trump signing an executive order temporarily or indefinitely freezing immigration from seven broken countries should be no more than a 4 on the \u201c \u201d scale of 1 to 10. To remind, the executive order suspends entry into the United States for refugees from any country for 120 days; suspends refugees from Syria indefinitely; and bars visitors from the seven countries President Obama restricted from participating in the Visa Waiver Program for 90 days. So why has the reaction to this order become an 8? Restricting immigration from select countries on sudden notice is fair game for criticism.",
        "President Trump said Monday that Lockheed Martin has cut $600 million from its next lot of 90 Joint Strike Fighter planes, capping weeks of private meetings with Lockheed Martin chief executive Marillyn Hewson and public criticisms of the program\u2019s cost. He specified that the would apply to the company\u2019s next group of 90 planes but offered few details on how the program or contract would change as a result. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening with Lockheed, number one we\u2019re cutting the price of their planes by a lot but they\u2019re also expanding and that\u2019s going to be a good thing.",

        "Melania Trump has finished her first week as first lady \u2014 a title that automatically makes her one of the most prominent women in the country. And yet she was barely visible. She cut an elegant figure at her husband\u2019s and at the inaugural balls. But two days later, she returned to New York, as she had said she would, to tend to her son, Barron, who remains in school there. Meanwhile, she has given little indication of how much she intends to embrace the life of a public figure. She is said to be building her staff.",
        "The of Taylor Gourmet angered some Washingtonians today by meeting with President Trump for a connected to his executive order cutting regulations for small businesses. Casey Patten, who the local chain of hoagie shops in 2008, was photographed shaking hands with the president in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. The meeting was first reported by Popville. com, and quickly led to Twitter calls for a boycott from its patrons, many of whom reside in the District of Columbia, which voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton. Patten has not yet responded to multiple requests for comment.",
        "Hundreds of thousands of dollars have been raised online to help rebuild a mosque in Texas, which was destroyed in a weekend blaze. By Monday afternoon, nearly $900, 000 had been pledged to the Islamic Center of Victoria, according to a GoFundMe page.

        "Democrats intensified their opposition to President Trump on Tuesday by further delaying the confirmation of several of his Cabinet nominees amid strong Republican objections. Hours after Trump fired acting attorney general Sally Yates for refusing to defend his executive order banning certain travelers and refugees, Democrats blocked a committee from approving the president\u2019s choice for attorney general. Amid concerns with information provided by his picks to lead the departments of Health and Human Services and Treasury, Democrats did not show up at another Senate committee at all.",
        "President Trump has narrowed his potential Supreme Court nominees to two, and both were reportedly called to Washington before he announces his choice Tuesday night in a televised event at the White House. CNN reported that Judge Neil Gorsuch of Colorado was already in Washington and that Judge Thomas M. Hardiman was on his way from Pittsburgh. There was no comment from the White House about why both men were needed in the capital, but social media exploded with satirical comparisons to Trump\u2019s television show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d as well as to \u201cThe Bachelor.",
        "President Trump\u2019s first Supreme Court nomination has the potential to do more than reshape the nation\u2019s judicial branch for years to come. It could end the Senate\u2019s long history as the world\u2019s greatest deliberative body. Liberal and conservative activists are girding for a fight that, under current rules, gives Democrats the power to block any court nomination. But in this week\u2019s environment, with Democrats delaying Cabinet nominations and both sides calling each other names largely unheard of in the history of the Senate\u2019s genteel discourse, Republicans could take steps to eliminate that power.",
        "For hours, the intruder strolled around what should have been one of the most tightly secured buildings in the country. Inside the Loews Hotel in downtown Philadelphia at various points Thursday were President Trump, Vice President Pence, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) and scores of other Republican members of Congress. Reporters were kept out, and only a few select staffers, family members and outsiders were allowed to participate in the private GOP policy retreat.",
        "Sally Yates had to know that when she refused to enforce President Trump\u2019s travel ban on Monday, she was effectively resigning her post as acting attorney general. After all, she was already a a holdover from the Obama administration in place solely to bridge the time until Trump\u2019s attorney general nominee \u2014 Jeff Sessions \u2014 is confirmed later this week. All the hubbub then about Trump\u2019s decision to dismiss Yates on Monday night kind of misses the point. It\u2019s not that Yates was dismissed that\u2019s important and telling. It\u2019s how she was dismissed that matters.",
        "The Trump administration is considering a plan to weed out immigrants who are likely to require public assistance, as well as to deport \u2014 when possible \u2014 immigrants already living in the United States who depend on taxpayer help, according to a draft executive order obtained by The Washington Post. A second draft order under consideration calls for a substantial in the system through which the United States administers immigrant and nonimmigrant visas, with the aim of tightly controlling who enters the country and who can enter the workforce, and reducing the burden on U. S. taxpayers.",
        "In a blatant effort to direct attention from his disastrous travel ban, President Trump moved up his announcement of his Supreme Court nominee. Tonight, he will announce his nominee to replace the late associate justice Antonin Scalia. Liberals and conservatives share a common fallacy, perhaps even attempt to cultivate it, to rev up their own troops. They would have us believe that abortion rights and gay marriage are up for grabs. This is silliness insofar as any justice Trump would nominate will not be the on abortion, the Second Amendment, Citizens United, affirmative action or any other issue.",
        "AMERICA\u2019S HISTORY of orderly freedom reflects the strength of our Constitution and laws. Yet it also demonstrates the power of unwritten rules \u2014 norms of civility and decency \u2014 that are often hard to define but always crucial to respect, lest social trust disappear and instability spread. As Judge Learned Hand famously remarked: \u201cLiberty lies in the hearts of men and women; when it dies there, no constitution, no law, no court can save it; no constitution, no law, no court can even do much to help it."
