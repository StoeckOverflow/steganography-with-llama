        "If confirmed by the Senate as secretary of state, Rex Tillerson will immediately confront a major test, and it won\u2019t come from abroad. The issue? Will the nation\u2019s top diplomat be loyal to his troops or will he cave to a possible White witch hunt against State Department employees who signed an internal memo to senior officials objecting to President Trump\u2019s executive order suspending the nation\u2019s refugee program and denying U. S. entry to citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries?",
        "Democrats \u2014 at least some of them \u2014 are coming to the realization that if they\u2019re going to fight the Trump administration effectively, they\u2019ll have to play hardball. So Tuesday, Democrats in the Senate boycotted the committee votes on the nominations of Tom Price as secretary of health and human services and Steven Mnuchin as treasury secretary, saying both had misled the committees (about stock trades in Price\u2019s case and home foreclosures in Mnuchin\u2019s) and therefore that their confirmations should be delayed until they can be forced to answer more questions.",
        "The damage already wrought by President Trump\u2019s temporary ban on refugees from seven countries is plain for all to see. Twenty thousand refugees could be affected by the suspension, according to the United Nations, including more than 800 who were supposed to travel this week alone. Overall, 90, 000 U. S. visa holders will be caught up in the ban, among them holders, patients traveling to the United States for medical care (including young children) people seeking to reunite with their spouses and other relatives, and men and women who assisted with the U. S. military in wars overseas.",
        "Interesting times we live in. The ban on Muslims, which was not a ban on Muslims, except they all seemed to be Muslims who were held up at airports, no Johnsons or Aberystwyths, and they had green cards and visas, including a translator formerly employed in a war zone by U. S.",
        "What would you do if you worked for an impetuous blunderbuss who ordered an action of dubious legality? More precisely, when, if ever, do federal employees have the right to disregard a presidential order or administration policy? That question became relevant with people here and abroad in a mighty uproar over President Trump\u2019s immigration order. It shamed the nation by temporarily restricting immigration from certain Muslim majority countries \u2014 an action that one judge after another blocked.",
        "As Federal Reserve Chair Janet L. Yellen prepares to enter what could be her final year in her post, she may suddenly find herself in the crosshairs of the new president. President Trump has pledged to slash taxes for businesses and consumers, boost spending on infrastructure and the military, and spur the economy to 4 percent growth. But the Federal Reserve could end up pushing the economy in the other direction. The central bank is charged with a dual mandate of keeping unemployment low and prices stable.",
        "President Trump\u2019s top trade adviser said Germany was using a \u201cgrossly undervalued\u201d euro to \u201cexploit\u201d its trading partners in Europe and the United States, comments that triggered a spike in the euro\u2019s value to a high. In comments to the Financial Times, Peter Navarro, the head of Trump\u2019s National Trade Council and an architect of many of the administration\u2019s trade policies, also declared a proposed trade agreement between the United States and Europe to be dead, citing Germany\u2019s currency as an impediment.",
        "QUEBEC CITY, Canada \u2014 They call it \u201cradio poubelle,\u201d or trash radio. Quebec City has developed the dubious reputation as Canada\u2019s capital of shock jocks, online radio hosts who love to provoke with their outrageous talk about women, homosexuals and Muslims. As this city of 800, 000 deals with the emotional aftermath of Sunday\u2019s shooting at a local mosque that left six worshipers dead and several injured, the role of trash radio in spreading xenophobic attitudes is getting new attention.",
        "If even a fraction of the new allegations at Baylor are true, former coaches Art and Kendal Briles should be unemployable in college athletics, and the Board of Regents needs to feel the hurt, too. The NCAA should consider the death penalty for Baylor, or risk becoming an organization of human jellyfish. On Monday, 52 paper cutouts appeared on the Baylor campus, stenciled with the words, \u201cHow many more?\u201d It\u2019s a good question.",
        "Over a decade ago, George W. Bush\u2019s presidency attracted plenty of attention for charges that it had mistreated scientific information. By the middle Bush years, reports were rampant that the administration had presented inaccurate or incomplete information on issues such as climate change and stem cell research, edited scientific reports to skew their contents, or had prevented scientists on the government payroll from speaking with the media about their findings and knowledge. These problems didn\u2019t appear immediately \u2014 they snowballed over the course of the Bush administration.",
        "The banging sounded like furniture was being slammed in her daughter\u2019s bedroom. Startled by the noise just before 2 a. m. on New Year\u2019s Day, Suzanne Zaremba dashed down the hallway of her suburban Maryland home to Charlotte\u2019s room. She found her slender, daughter wrestling with a masked intruder. Charlotte, she recalled, was screaming, \u201cCall 911!\u201d Suzanne, a registered nurse, shouted for her husband, Jim Zaremba. Then she vaulted onto the floor by the bedroom window, where Charlotte and the stranger were on their knees grappling with one another.",
        "President Trump urged Senate Republican leaders Wednesday to be prepared to tear up the rules of the Senate and \u201cgo nuclear\u201d if Democrats try to block his Supreme Court nominee from winning confirmation \u2014 complicating the beginning of Judge Neil Gorsuch\u2019s delicate courtship of the lawmakers who will decide his fate.",
        "President Trump\u2019s first 12 days in office have been marked by controversy, division (even among Republicans) and uncertainty. His nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court on Tuesday night was the antithesis of all that. In the Gorsuch, Trump picked a man who by all previous standards checks the boxes of a Supreme Court nominee and would be tough for Democrats to block. (I emphasize by all previous standards, for reasons we\u2019ll get to.) And yet, Democrats are girding for perhaps their biggest fight yet \u2014 one that has no guarantee of measurable success and plenty of downside.",
        "Perhaps the biggest reason Republicans love Neil Gorsuch\u2019s selection as President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee \u2014 apart from his age \u2014 is the fact that he\u2019s a demonstrated originalist. Among conservatives, that\u2019s basically code for \u201dnot an activist judge.\u201d And among liberals, it\u2019s basically code for \u201dconservative.\u201d But the term is much more complicated than those admittedly partisan views. So below, let\u2019s review what the term means and how it\u2019s evolved over the years. What\u2019s the definition?",
        "President Trump has chosen his first nominee, but it remains Justice Anthony M. Kennedy\u2019s Supreme Court. The question is how much longer he wants it. Kennedy, 80 and celebrating his 29th year on the court this month, will remain the pivotal member of the court no matter how the warfare between Republicans and Democrats plays out. On almost every big social issue, neither the court\u2019s liberal, justices nor Kennedy\u2019s fellow conservative colleagues can prevail without him.",
        "Not since 2006 has the Supreme Court taken up a case involving \u201cdeath with dignity\u201d legislation \u2014 the handful of state laws that allow people to end their lives with the help of a physician. That year, the court handed a victory to death with dignity advocates, ruling that the attorney general could not bar doctors in Oregon \u2014 the first state to pass such a law \u2014 from giving terminally ill patients drugs to facilitate suicide.",
        "Senate Republicans moved aggressively Wednesday to push through several of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees, the latest round in an escalating showdown with Democrats trying to thwart President Trump\u2019s administration. Republicans lashed out angrily at Democrats trying to stall the president\u2019s nominees at the committee level, suspending the rules to approve two nominees, Rep. Tom Price ( .) for secretary of health and human services and Steven T. Mnuchin to lead the Treasury. Republicans also advanced the nomination of Sen.",
        "The Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday voted 11 to 9 to advance the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions ( .) as attorney general. He is expected to be confirmed by the full Senate by the end of the week. Republicans, who need only a majority vote to approve him, control 52 of the Senate\u2019s 100 seats, and Democrats have thus far failed to persuade anyone on the other side of the aisle to oppose Sessions. The committee vote, which passed along party lines, comes at a tumultuous time for the Department of Justice.",
        "Sens. Susan Collins ( ) and Lisa Murkowski ( ) said Wednesday that they intend to vote against the confirmation of President Trump\u2019s education secretary nominee, Betsy DeVos, giving Democrats two of at least three Republican votes they would need to block her appointment. Republican leaders said that despite the defections, they are confident DeVos will be confirmed. \u201cShe\u2019ll be confirmed \u2014 you can take that to the bank,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn ( .) the majority whip.",
        "Rex Tillerson won confirmation Wednesday to become secretary of state, placing a longtime oil company executive at the helm of what President Trump has promised will be an \u201cAmerica first\u201d foreign policy. The final vote was 56 to 43, with four members of the Democratic caucus in favor of confirmation: Sens. Heidi Heitkamp ( . D.) Angus King ( ) Joe Manchin III ( . Va.) and Mark R. Warner ( . ). Interim Democratic National Committee chairwoman Donna Brazile castigated the choice of a businessman with close ties to Russia, especially given U. S.",
        "In November 2015, Stephen K. Bannon \u2014 then the executive chairman of Breitbart News \u2014 was hosting a satellite radio show. His guest was Rep. Ryan Zinke ( .) who opposed President Obama\u2019s plan to resettle some Syrian refugees in the United States. \u201cWe need to put a stop on refugees until we can vet,\u201d Zinke said. Bannon cut him off. \u201cWhy even let \u2019em in?\u201d he asked. Bannon said that vetting refugees from countries would cost money and time. \u201cCan\u2019t that money be used in the United States?\u201d he said.",
        "The Trump administration said Wednesday that it would hold Iran \u201caccountable\u201d for its recent launch, threatening an unspecified response to what it called a violation of U. N. restrictions. In a brief statement read during the regular White House press briefing, Michael Flynn, President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, said the administration was \u201cofficially putting Iran on notice\u201d for the test launch and for what he called Iran\u2019s threatening and destabilizing actions in support of Houthi rebels seeking to overthrow a U. S. government in Yemen.",
        "President Trump is capable of many a miracle. On Wednesday, after just 12 days on the job, he raised the dead. Addressing a small group of African American aides and supporters to kick off Black History Month, the new president not only offered pro forma praise for the usual suspects \u2014 Rosa Parks, Harriet Tubman, Martin Luther King Jr. \u2014 but also singled out somebody who recently caught his attention. \u201cFrederick Douglass,\u201d Trump said, \u201cis an example of somebody who\u2019s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice. \u201d Amazing job, Frederick! Great work!",
        "You want bipartisanship on Supreme Court nominations? Let\u2019s have a consensus moment around Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s idea that having only eight Supreme Court justices is just fine. \u201cThere is certainly long historical precedent for a Supreme Court with fewer justices,\u201d the Texas Republican said last year when GOP senators were refusing even to give a hearing to Judge Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee. Cruz cited a Democratic court appointee, Justice Stephen Breyer, to give his case heft. He noted that \u201cJustice Breyer observed that the vacancy is not impacting the ability of the court to do its job.",
        "The Democrats are babbling and discouraged. Specifically, Rep. Nancy Pelosi ( .) is babbling, and Sen. Charles E. Schumer ( . Y.) is in tears. They are feeling the impact of their 2016 losses more acutely now than they did in November, as the full limits and consequences of their powerlessness are on full display. The Democratic Caucus is pointlessly attempting to slow the confirmation of President Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks, including boycotting this morning\u2019s Senate Finance Committee votes on Rep. Tom Price ( .) and Steve Mnuchin and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee vote on Scott Pruitt.",
        "No, President Trump\u2019s order curtailing entry to the United States from seven countries is not the \u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d he threatened in December 2015, but it\u2019s bad enough. Even after the dust settles from its spectacularly mishandled early days, even after the administration patches up its worst flaws \u2014 such as the exclusion of holders and those who aided U. S. troops in the Middle East \u2014 the measure recasts the United States as a country so fearful of an admittedly serious terrorist threat that it would retreat from its most generous traditions.",
        "With an asperity born of exasperation, Justice Antonin Scalia once wrote, \u201cIf you want aspirations, you can read the Declaration of Independence,\u201d but \u201cthere is no such philosophizing in our Constitution,\u201d which is \u201ca practical and pragmatic charter of government. \u201d Scalia was wrong, and much depends on Neil Gorsuch not resembling Scalia in this regard.",
        "PRESIDENT TRUMP\u2019S nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court elicited an immediate, furious and depressingly predictable reaction. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( . Y.) called him an ideologue in a tweet sent a mere after Mr. Trump made his announcement, and liberal senators such as Sherrod Brown ( ) and Elizabeth Warren ( .) announced they would oppose the nomination shortly after that. Conservative activist groups, meanwhile, vowed to go on an campaign to advance Mr. Gorsuch\u2019s nomination. The politicization of the judiciary, in other words, continues apace.",
        "AMONA, West Bank \u2014 Security forces hauled away defiant Israeli settlers Wednesday amid a final showdown at a hardscrabble Israeli settlement that the supreme court has deemed illegal because it was built on privately owned Palestinian land. The razing of Amona and the eviction of its 40 families has been more than a decade in the making. It also underscored the political challenges for Israeli leaders who count on the support of settlers and plan to further expand the Israeli footprint in the West Bank.",
        "Leaders for the health insurance industry, state insurance commissioners and brokers warned Wednesday that more health plans almost certainly will defect from Affordable Care Act marketplaces unless Congress and the Trump administration provide some concrete assurances within the next two months. Unless the government promises to continue subsidies and other features of the law for at least another year, some states probably will not have any insurers selling health plans to individuals buying coverage on their own for 2018, the witnesses warned at a Senate hearing."
