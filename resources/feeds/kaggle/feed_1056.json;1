        "The United States and Mexico appear to have taken the first steps toward renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, according to a Mexican government document, walking down a path that would fulfill one of President Trump\u2019s big campaign promises and potentially transform the hemisphere\u2019s economy. A communique posted by Mexico\u2019s foreign and economic ministries on a government website on Wednesday said that the Mexican government had begun a series of consultations with the private sector, a process which it said would take 90 days.",
        "President Trump teed off on the media Wednesday during an event held to mark Black History Month, calling CNN \u201cfake news\u201d and once again decrying a false report that he had removed a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office. Trump\u2019s remarks came at the top of what was billed as a \u201clistening session\u201d at which he sat at a conference table in the Roosevelt Room with a group of African Americans, most of whom had played a role in his campaign for president or worked on the transition.",
        "LONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s House of Commons voted decisively Wednesday to authorize Prime Minister Theresa May to trigger the start of the country\u2019s exit from the European Union. The outcome of the vote was never in doubt, even as lawmakers spent a second consecutive day arguing the merits of a departure that the bitterly divided country approved in a June referendum. The margin of Wednesday evening\u2019s roll call, 498 to 114, gives May a convincing mandate as she prepares to launch divorce talks with the E. U. by the end of next month.",
        "Hours after President Trump banned millions of Muslims from U. S. shores, someone on Twitter brought up an old speech from an old president. \u201cUnifying,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWorth remembering. \u201d The speech maker\u2019s daughter, Jenna Bush Hager, retweeted the comment. A few days later, Tuesday morning, she thought it was worth pasting the speech itself. \u201c \u2019This is not the America I know \u2026 \u2019 \u201d Bush Hager wrote, quoting former president George W. Bush\u2019s speech at a mosque after the attacks \u2014 amid a violent backlash against U. S. Muslims. \u201dThis is not the America I know.",

        "Officials at the National Zoo have suspended their search for a bobcat, named Ollie, who escaped Monday from her enclosure at the Zoo. For the last two days, a team of zookeepers, police officers at the zoo and rescue experts from the D. C. Humane Rescue Alliance have searched for her, but to no avail. At a news conference Wednesday, zoo officials said they were ending the active search for Ollie because she remains elusive.

        "(Sinawi Medine) It was like looking in a mirror. Years ago, he had taken the same long and painful journey. He fled his country, leaving his home and family.

Now, years later, with a camera in his hand and on a boat in the middle of that same sea, he looked into the eyes of the desperate people in front of him and saw himself.",
        "Planning for the final assault on Raqqa, the capital of the Islamic State\u2019s caliphate, had been grinding on for more than seven months. There had been dozens of meetings of President Barack Obama\u2019s top national security team, scores of draft battle plans and hundreds of hours of anguished, debates. There were no good options, but Obama\u2019s top foreign policy advisers were convinced that they had finally settled on an approach that could work \u2014 arming Kurdish fighters in northern Syria, current and former U. S. officials said.",
        "The United States and Iran traded threats Thursday as both nations sought new footing in a power struggle that could jeopardize the landmark international nuclear accord that President Trump has called \u201cthe worst deal ever negotiated. \u201d The Trump administration was preparing additional economic penalties on Iran related to the country\u2019s recent ballistic missile test, with an announcement expected as soon as Friday, according to a U.

        "President Trump is considering how to allow Americans to opt out of complying with federal policies and regulations on the grounds of religion, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Thursday, a move that critics said could open the door to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender or gender identity. \u201cThere\u2019s clearly a lot of evidence in the last couple of years of the government coming in with regulations and policies that have, frankly, denied people the ability to live according to their faith,\u201d Spicer said during his daily briefing.",
        "Senate Republicans pushed Scott Pruitt\u2019s nomination to head the Environmental Protection Agency through committee on Thursday, using a procedural maneuver for the third time this week to ignore Democrats and send one of President Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees to the Senate floor. Republicans on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee suspended the panel\u2019s rules Thursday morning and approved Pruitt, with 11 votes in favor and none opposed.

        "President Trump\u2019s personal physician, Harold Bornstein, is still talking to the press, and still saying some strange things. In a new interview with the New York Times, Bornstein discloses that Trump takes a couple of previously undisclosed drugs: finasteride, a prostate drug that can be (and in Trump\u2019s case is) used as a treatment, and another drug for rosacea, a skin problem.

        "There are many people to thank for the coming accession of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Donald Trump for winning the election. Hillary Clinton for losing it. Mitch McConnell for holding open the high court seat through 2016, resolute and immovable against furious (and hypocritical) opposition from Democrats and media. And, of course, Harry Reid. God bless Harry Reid. It\u2019s because of him that Gorsuch is guaranteed elevation to the court. In 2013, as Senate majority leader, Reid blew up the joint.",
        "After his spat with Mexico, after the travel ban, this week President Trump did something that surprised me. He put in place a policy with which I agreed. He placed a smart check on federal regulations. His executive action requires any department that wants to add a regulation to get rid of two existing ones. It might seem gimmicky, but the British government instituted just this \u201c \u201d rule in 2013 and it has worked well.",
        "Senate Democrats should use any and all means, including the filibuster, to block confirmation of President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee. They will almost surely fail.

        "\u201csharia law,\u201d or something resembling it, may well be coming to the United States. Just not in the form many Americans expected. That is, the religiously motivated laws creeping into public policymaking aren\u2019t based on the Koran, and they aren\u2019t coming from mythical Islamists in, say, Dearborn, Mich. They\u2019re coming from the White House, which wants to make it easier for Christians to impose their beliefs and practices on the rest of us.",
        "Bernie Sanders, an independent, represents Vermont in the U. S. Senate. President Trump and other Republicans have talked about the greed of the pharmaceutical industry. Recently, Trump said (rightly) that Big Pharma is \u201cgetting away with murder. \u201d But talk is cheap. The question is: Will Republicans really have the guts to join me and many of my colleagues in standing up to the drug companies to fight for American consumers and end the disgrace of having our country pay by far the highest prescription drug prices in the world?",
        "\u201cI WANT us to be honest with one another,\u201d a new leader on the national stage said Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re on the same team. We share the same mission.

        "The criticism of vaccines voiced by President Trump and some other public figures is at odds with the attitudes of most Americans, who overwhelmingly support requiring public school children to be vaccinated for measles, mumps and rubella, according to a Pew Research Center survey released Thursday. Overall, 82 percent of Americans support requiring students in public schools to be vaccinated for those three diseases.

        "The first and last time I ever saw Stephen K. Bannon was last May at the Cannes Film Festival, where his film \u201cClinton Cash\u201d was screening for overseas buyers. The documentary, a strategically timed takedown of Hillary Clinton centering on her alleged ethical lapses and dubious financial dealings, was based on Peter Schweizer\u2019s 2015 book of the same name. While I interviewed Schweizer in an empty ballroom of a Croisette hotel, Bannon \u2014 who wrote and produced \u201cClinton Cash\u201d \u2014 paced outside, occasionally stealing a furtive glance our way through an open door.",
        "\u201cLegacy\u201d is a telling choice of subtitle for Fox\u2019s latest summoning of its hit \u201c24\u201d franchise. No matter when or how often the network brings back the frantic counterterrorism action drama, \u201c24\u201d will forever carry a whiff of fears and responses. The show first became a prescient and even cathartic success 15 years ago, at the outset of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. As those wars continue, so do the occasional flashes of the paranoia and patriotism that \u201c24\u201d triggered in loyal viewers and, we can presume, some of our leaders. So there is a legacy here.",
