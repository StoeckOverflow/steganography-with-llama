        "President Trump on Friday launched a broad effort to ease regulations on Wall Street, setting up what is likely to be a protracted battle over how to unwind rules put in place after the last financial crisis. In an executive order, Trump ordered a review of the laws and regulations that govern the U. S. financial system in an opening bid to upend 2010\u2019s financial reform law, known as .",
        "President Trump on Friday signed a memorandum asking the Labor Department to review a contentious rule meant to protect retirement savers from receiving poor investment advice. Out of all the regulations that Trump has taken aim at since taking office, this is the one that could impact consumers\u2019 wallet the most, as it directly impacts the advice brokers give to ordinary investors. The regulation, known as the fiduciary rule, was finalized last year by the Obama administration and requires brokers working with retirement savers to put their clients\u2019 interest ahead of their own.",
        "More than 100, 000 visas have been revoked as a result of President Trump\u2019s ban on travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries, an attorney for the government asserted Friday in federal court in Alexandria, Va. The number came out during a hearing in a lawsuit by two Yemeni brothers who arrived at Dulles International Airport last Saturday and were quickly put on a return flight to Ethi o pia because of the new restrictions.",
        "An Iranian Worcester Polytechnic Institute student, thought to be previously unable to make his way into the United States because of President Trump\u2019s controversial travel ban, has landed at Boston\u2019s Logan International Airport, a school spokeswoman said. The student, Behnam Partopour, 27, flew into Boston from Frankfurt on a Lufthansa airlines flight, the spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman, Colleen Wamback, said Partopour had a student visa \u2014 though it was not immediately clear how \u2014 given that Trump\u2019s ban would have required it to be revoked.",
        "The number of Americans signing up for coverage through HealthCare. gov dropped by a for 2017, as efforts by President Trump and congressional Republicans to demolish the Affordable Care Act propelled the first enrollment decline in its history. The lower total, with 9. 2 million consumers choosing health plans in ACA marketplaces through the enrollment deadline Tuesday, marks a striking turnabout from the trend as the Obama administration neared its end \u2014 when for coverage under the law were running steadily ahead of a year ago.",
        "One of the hallmarks of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency is speed. The 45th president of the United States was fond of saying on the campaign trail that most politicians did too little and that he would be a man of action if he got into the White House. It was \u2014 and is \u2014 a point of pride for him. \u201cThe administration has already racked up more than 60 significant actions,\u201d White House press secretary Sean Spicer boasted at Friday\u2019s news briefing, noting that the total included \u201c21 executive actions, 16 meetings with foreign leaders and 10 stakeholder meetings.",

S. taxpayers were left footing a bill of nearly $100, 000 in hotel rooms for Secret Service and embassy staff. It was a jaunt out of the country for Eric, the executive of the Trump Organization who, like his father, pledged to keep the company separate from the presidency. Eric mingled with real estate brokers, dined at an beachfront eatery and spoke to hundreds at an \u201cultra exclusive\u201d Trump Tower Punta del Este evening party celebrating his visit.",
        "The man was quickly shot and arrested Friday morning by French police and soldiers, but from the vantage point of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, it was a crisis dire enough to put a nation 4, 000 miles away on high alert. \u201cA new radical Islamic terrorist has just attacked in Louvre Museum in Paris. Tourists were locked down. France on edge again. GET SMART U. S.,\u201d President Trump tweeted. French authorities are indeed investigating the incident as possible terrorism.",
        "\u201cTwo Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized, and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. Most people didn\u2019t know that because it didn\u2019t get covered. \u201d \u2014 White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, interview with MSNBC\u2019s Chris Mathews, Feb. 2 In defending President Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily banning refugees, immigrants and citizens from Iraq and six other countries, Conway referred to something that didn\u2019t happen \u2014 the \u201cBowling Green massacre.",
        "If anyone can explain why Betsy DeVos has become the most embattled nominee ever for education secretary, it\u2019s Anna Caudill, Tennessee mother of two. Caudill has a son with disabilities. Her public school district did such a poor job educating him, she says, that she is suing in federal court. She can\u2019t afford a private school, so she is him. She\u2019s exactly the kind of parent who would seem aligned with DeVos, who believes in using public funds to help parents pay for private education. But Caudill strongly opposes DeVos.",
        "The flag fluttering above the U. S. Capitol is emblazoned with a crescent and star. Chants of \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d rise from inside the building. That\u2019s the provocative opening scene of a movie outlined 10 years ago by Stephen K. Bannon that envisioned radical Muslims taking over the country and remaking it into the \u201cIslamic States of America,\u201d according to a document describing the project obtained by The Washington Post.",
        "At this point, it looks as though every third decision made by the Trump administration will generate spontaneous protests. Chanting in the streets, accusations of fascism, profane grousing on Facebook and Twitter; the word \u201cresistance,\u201d mostly inactive since the 1960s and 1970s, has suddenly sprung to life. Maybe we should be heartened, as former president Barack Obama says, \u201cby the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country. \u201d But there\u2019s something unreflective about all this engagement, and that\u2019s true even if it\u2019s as rooted in sound morality as the demonstrators believe.",
        "President Trump is finally following through on his promise to Make America Safe Again. He has begun our attack on Australia. The president gave Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull (who is a total failure!) a good chewing out this week, telling him a refugee agreement between the two countries was the \u201cworst deal ever,\u201d calling their conversation the \u201cworst call\u201d and abruptly ending the exchange 25 minutes into what was supposed to be an talk.",
        "Richard Glover is an Australian writer and broadcaster. How did Australia react to the belligerent, belittling way in which the White House dealt with our prime minister? After all, not only did President Trump berate our leader on the phone; his spokesman couldn\u2019t even get his name right. Memo to Sean Spicer: It\u2019s Turnbull, not Trumble. I suppose we can be grateful \u2014 at least he didn\u2019t confuse us with Austria. Australians didn\u2019t like it. But we\u2019re willing to put up with a lot. To understand why, it\u2019s helpful to know a little Australian history.",
        "After a violent rampage by anarchists forced the University of California at Berkeley to cancel provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos\u2019s speech Wednesday night, President Trump was quick to blame the University. If U. C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view \u2014 NO FEDERAL FUNDS? \u2014 Donald J.",
        "\u201cThey didn\u2019t come out to vote for Hillary. They didn\u2019t come out. And that was a big \u2014 so thank you to the African American community,\u201d taunted Donald Trump at a mostly white rally in Hershey, Pa. in December. Trump\u2019s celebration of lower black election turnout came to mind as I watched him on television kicking off Black History Month at the White House this week with his top black supporters and campaign workers. The assembled were all grins as they listened to Trump pay tribute to himself and past black civil rights heroes.",
        "Maxim Eristavi is a nonresident research fellow with the Atlantic Council and of Hromadske International, an independent news outlet, based in Kiev. The citizens of Ukraine have never had any illusions about the international community\u2019s willingness to take their side in their bloody conflict with Russia. Ukrainians collectively roll their eyes whenever one of their friends abroad expresses \u201cgrave concern\u201d about Moscow\u2019s aggression, because those words are so rarely followed by concrete actions. But at least they knew they could count on the Americans. Ukraine and the United States have enjoyed friendly relations for a good 25 years now.",
        "IRBIL, Iraq \u2014 President Trump is \u201cfoolish\u201d and has ignited the \u201cflame of jihad\u201d with a raid in Yemen in which civilians were killed, said Friday in its first official comments on the new U. S. administration. That the raid came only days after Trump\u2019s vow to eradicate Islamist terrorism in his inauguration speech, makes it \u201cclear for us that the threat was not directed to the Islamic militants only, but to all the Muslims, men, women and even children,\u201d \u2019s bulletin said, accusing the Trump administration of intentionally killing women and children. U. S.",
        "The Pentagon and Lockheed Martin announced on Friday a contract deal for the next batch of 90 Joint Strike Fighter jets that shaves $728 million off the total cost of the program and brings the cost of the stealth plane below $95 million for the first time. The contract is \u201ca good and fair deal for the taxpayers, the U. S. Government, allies, and Industry,\u201d Program Executive Officer Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan said in a statement. \u201cWe continue to work with Industry to drive costs out of the program.",
        "Donald Trump may be a federal employee now, but fellow government workers won\u2019t be getting discounts at his Pennsylvania Avenue hotel \u2014 even if the hotel\u2019s website promises otherwise. Scroll through the offers on the Trump International Hotel\u2019s website and you\u2019ll see a section advertising special government rates, currently capped at $182 per night by the General Services Administration. \u201cIt is our pleasure to welcome Retired and Active Duty members of the United States Military and Armed Forces,\u201d the page reads. But good luck getting one of those discounted rates. A screengrab of the Trump International Hotel, Washington, D.",
        "Steve Thompson was on his way to pick up some feed for his goat farm Sunday morning when he noticed an military convoy and started filming. When he neared the lead vehicle in the convoy, the Shepherdsville, Ky. man noticed something else: A large blue and white Trump campaign flag. \u201cI just thought it was just a bunch of military vehicles,\u201d Thompson, who was driving near Louisville at the time, told the Lexington Herald Leader. \u201cI was surprised because I figured you wouldn\u2019t be able to fly anything on a Humvee other than an American flag.",
        "AVDIIVKA, Ukraine \u2014 From the center of this beleaguered eastern Ukrainian town, air bursts from exploding shells could be seen just a few hundred yards away Friday, and the sound of intense outgoing and incoming rounds echoed from several directions. \u201cThis is the worst fighting we\u2019ve seen in Ukraine since 2014 and early 2015,\u201d said a visibly upset Alexander Hug, head of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\u2019s monitoring mission in Ukraine, who was standing near a makeshift humanitarian aid station where shrapnel had collapsed a tent overnight.",
        "The signs announcing his death appeared two weeks ago, tied to a black fence in front of a commanding brick house on 13th Street in Northwest Washington. \u201cRemembering Wilbert E. Anderson,\u201d the two signs proclaim, \u201cwho loved this neighborhood and visiting with everyone who walked by. . \u201d Some people placed flowers underneath, mourning the man known in Logan Circle as \u201cThe Mayor of 13th Street. \u201d Anderson, once homeless, was a fixture on the steps beside the fence, greeting passersby in his deep, rich voice. He sounded like an actor as he dispensed street wisdom.",
        "HOUSTON \u2014 The neatly packaged narrative for Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl would be that Tom Brady will take the field, capping the season of his Deflategate revenge tour for the New England Patriots, not only with a chance to win another Lombardi Trophy but also with an opportunity to settle the debate once and for all about which quarterback is the greatest in NFL history by putting Joe Montana, Dan Marino, John Elway, Brett Favre, Peyton Manning and everyone else inarguably in his mirror for good. In truth, that argument might be already settled.",
        "Jason McFadden was at work one morning in late January when he got a text message from his wife, Cassie. \u201cWhat the crap do I do?\u201d it read. That text was followed by a picture \u2014 of a rattlesnake inside a toilet at their Texas home. Life is full of adventures. (Courtesy of Jason McFadden) \u201cLike everybody else,\u201d Jason McFadden said, \u201cmy jaw dropped. \u201d McFadden said he recognized the snake was a threat, and told his wife to kill it. She grabbed a broom, he said, in an attempt to block it in the toilet.",

        "The Department of Homeland Security complied with a judge\u2019s orders Saturday and stopped enforcing President Trump\u2019s controversial travel ban, and the legal dispute over the president\u2019s powers could land at the nation\u2019s highest court. On Saturday evening, Trump administration lawyers filed a notice to appeal a Seattle federal judge\u2019s decision from Friday night that imposed a temporary, nationwide halt to Trump\u2019s order barring refugees and those from seven nations from entering the country. While his administration followed the orders of U. S. District Judge James L. Robart, the president blasted out his unhappiness with an extraordinarily personal criticism.",
        "President Trump ripped into a federal judge\u2019s decision to temporarily block enforcement of his controversial travel ban, sending tweets throughout the day. \u201cWhen a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot come in & out, especially for reasons of safety &. security \u2014 big trouble!\u201d Trump posted on Twitter early Saturday morning. He also appeared to question the legitimacy of the federal judge who issued the ruling. \u201cThe opinion of this judge, which essentially takes away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\u201d Trump tweeted.",
        "Judge James L. Robart wore a bow tie to the hearing, opened with a joke and finished with a thunderclap. He was known for that sort of thing. \u201cThe amicus law professors,\u201d Robart said Friday, noting the many groups that waited in his Seattle courtroom to argue for or against a motion to halt President Trump\u2019s travel ban. \u201cSounds like the three amigos. \u201d People laughed, despite the tension. The federal judge had a habit of mixing soft speech and extraordinary pronouncements."
