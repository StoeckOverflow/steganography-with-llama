        "While comparing what President Trump is doing with his executive power to what Barack Obama did, I noted that the ultimate judge of whether Trump has gone too far would not be politicians, but the courts. Well, just two weeks into his presidency, Trump has already had one of his executive orders halted by those courts. The Washington state judge\u2019s ruling late Friday represents a rare and early rebuke of presidential authority that could portend plenty of legal fights over Trump\u2019s powers in the months and years to come.",
        "As Rep. \u00c2 Suzanne Bonamici ( .) prepared to address her colleagues Friday morning in the House of Representatives, another woman adjusted a nearby easel with a large photograph of a baby girl. Mr. Speaker, this is Fatemeh, ? Bonamici said. She is not a terrorist. ? She explained the baby s predicament: Fatemeh was a infant from Iran in immediate need ? of surgery.",
        "BOSTON \u2014 Most of the more than 40 people from Iran who arrived at Logan International Airport on Saturday afternoon were ecstatic, the first large wave of travelers to come to the United States a week after President Trump banned them from entering the country.",
        "Soon after President Trump lifted off from the South Lawn of the White House for a long weekend in Florida, the administration\u2019s communications and policy teams convened for what some jokingly called their first \u201cstaff mixer. \u201d The Friday gathering in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building was both social and practical: Many still did not know each other\u2019s names, portfolios or phone extensions at a time when communication breakdowns were hampering Trump\u2019s young presidency.",
        "Before taking office, President Trump promised to place his assets in a trust designed to erect a wall between him and the businesses that made him wealthy. But newly released documents show that Trump himself is the sole beneficiary of the trust and that it is legally controlled by his oldest son and a longtime employee. The documents, obtained through a public records request by the investigative news service ProPublica and first reported by the New York Times, also show that Trump retains the legal power to revoke the trust at any time.",
        "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 The Saturday evening march began at Trump Plaza, a apartment building. President Trump hasn\u2019t actually owned it since 1991. Fine. It still has the name. It was a good place to start. From there, the marchers headed south, walking along the Intracoastal Waterway that separates West Palm Beach from ritzy Palm Beach island. They stopped shortly after 7 p. m. when they reached the bridge across from .",
        "Henry Olsen is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center. His book \u201cRonald Reagan: New Deal Republican\u201d is scheduled to be published in June. Monday would have been Ronald Reagan\u2019s 106th birthday. President Trump\u2019s election has caused many observers to bemoan Reagan\u2019s supposedly waning influence on today\u2019s Republican Party. But these people start from the same flawed assumption, that Trump\u2019s election means the United States and Republicans have rejected Reagan\u2019s legacy. Nothing could be further from the truth.",
        "Tight labor markets shrink income inequality by causing employers to bid up the price of scarce labor, so policymakers fretting about income inequality could give an epidemic a try. This might be a bit extreme, but if increased equality is the goal, Stanford University\u2019s Walter Scheidel should be heard. His scholarship encompasses many things (classics, history, human biology) and if current events are insufficiently depressing for you, try his book, \u201cThe Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Century.",
        "Rachel Manteuffel works in The Post\u2019s Editorial department. Dear the Honorable Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, How are you? No, really, how are you? I\u2019ve found myself thinking about you lately, and how things are going with you, and I just wanted you to know that I admire you very much and have some tokens of my esteem that you might enjoy. Such as blood. If you have any need for blood, you can have the eight or so units of that are right here in my body.",
        "Christine Emba edits The Post\u2019s In Theory blog. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone\u2019s debut, the start of a societal revolution that no one quite expected and a chance, perhaps, to reflect on the impact of the revolutionary technologies to come. The device was first presented at the January 2007 Macworld conference by the late Steve Jobs, who described it as a \u201crevolutionary mobile phone and a breakthrough Internet communications device. \u201d He wasn\u2019t exaggerating.",
        "The Gallup organization regularly publishes reports on the partisan leanings of the states, snapshots of the ebb and flow of political across the country. The most recent compilation provides one more piece of evidence of the degree to which Americans have moved away from the Democratic Party since former president Barack Obama was first elected. The story of the Democrats over the past eight years is well known. Obama twice won a majority of the popular vote and left the White House with an approval rating in the high 50s.",
        "This post has been updated. For the first two weeks of President Trump\u2019s administration, it seemed as though White House senior strategist Stephen K. Bannon was behind many of the biggest policy actions. With his stances on trade and immigration, Trump appeared to be hewing closely to the protectionist, nationalist economic policies that Bannon has espoused. On Friday, a tension seemed to emerge between Bannon\u2019s rhetoric and Trump\u2019s actions as president.",
        "Already Vanity Fair and the New Yorker have canceled their annual parties associated with the April 29 White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner, according to the New York Times. And comedian Samantha Bee is planning an alternative event, billed as \u201cNot the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner. \u201d Now calls are beginning to emerge for an outright boycott of the dinner, which ostensibly highlights the work of journalists but is traditionally headlined by the man in the Oval Office. In a recent editorial for U. S.",
        "When President Trump won the election, James Hagedorn was ready to take it to the bank. The chief executive of Scotts expected that Republicans would reduce his firm\u2019s tax rate from about 36 percent to 20 percent or less. He did not expect that Republicans would take such a broad approach to fulfilling Trump\u2019s promises on trade, with stiff new taxes on imports. The dirt sold by Scotts is largely raw materials imported from abroad, such as Canadian peat and processed coconut shells from Sri Lanka.",
        "DETROIT \u2014 President Trump welcomed executives of to the White House this week, alongside union representatives, and spent much of a camera spray reminiscing about how union members spurned their leaders to vote for him. \u201cSometimes your top people didn\u2019t support me, but the steelworkers supported me, right?\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe workers supported us big league. \u201d hours earlier, at a thinly attended news conference at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, Reps.

        "Late last summer, Vic Beasley Jr. visited his old high school coaches and addressed the Adairsville High football team. The players faced a rebuilding season, and Beasley believed he could deliver a pertinent message. The previous fall, Beasley recorded four sacks after the Atlanta Falcons drafted him with the eighth overall pick. His rookie season had been labeled a disappointment. \u201cI got a lot of things I need to accomplish this year to prove people wrong,\u201d Beasley told the players. \u201cMy first year didn\u2019t meet some people\u2019s standard. I\u2019m not going to let that define me.",
        "Super Bowl LI between the Atlanta Falcons and New England Patriots kicks off on Sunday and there are hundreds of prop bets for your consideration of those in Sin City. Most wagers are noted as a money line, with negative numbers representing the favorite. For example, a money line indicates a bettor needs to wager $110 to win $100. If the money line is a bettor would win $110 for every $100 put at risk. Some prop bets offer value, or available information (cough, cough) can help you put the odds in your favor.",
        "President Trump\u2019s personal physician recently revealed that the president takes finasteride, a drug used to combat baldness. The medication has been in the news for another reason: its potential side effects. In fact, approximately 1, 370 lawsuits have been filed against Merck, which markets finasteride. A lawsuit against the company will examine the pharmaceutical giant\u2019s culpability in the multitude of reported sexual side effects potentially associated with the drug. Merck did not respond to a request for comment. Merck sells finasteride under the brand name Propecia, a formulation of the medication.",
        "Oscar Jurado, 26, a quality assurance engineer, says he\u2019s cultured, knows how to cook and likes artsy intellectuals who \u201ccan give and take sass. \u201d Courtney Bradshaw, 23, a teacher, says she\u2019s empathetic, loves cooking and is looking for someone who shares her artistic sensibilities. We sent them to Hen Quarter in Alexandria to see if they could have a conversation. Courtney: We instinctively knew we were both from Date Lab. My first impression was relief!

        "Q: My son is 7, and basically every day we argue with him about getting dressed. He often asks us to dress him, which of course we don\u2019t do. Every night when he brushes his teeth and goes to the bathroom, he asks for or demands company in the four minutes it takes to complete those tasks. When he takes a bath, he wants \u201ccompany. \u201d Finally, at night, when we leave the room after putting him to bed, he tells us that he\u2019s lonely. He is an only child.",
        "A federal appeals court on Sunday ruled that President Trump\u2019s controversial immigration order will remain suspended for the time being, allowing those previously banned from coming to the United States at least another day to get here. The decision by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit preserves a lower judge\u2019s order to temporarily halt the ban \u2014 and based on a schedule the court outlined, the stop will remain in place at least until sometime on Monday. The Justice Department said it would not elevate the dispute to the Supreme Court before that.",
        "CHICAGO \u2014 After a federal appeals court early Sunday denied an initial request by the Trump administration to reinstate its controversial travel ban, a crush of people stranded in legal limbo rushed to fly back to the United States during the temporary stay. Sunday\u2019s ruling by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit capped several days of chaos as airlines and immigration authorities adjusted to a constantly changing landscape of court rulings and federal guidance on the executive order that barred refugees and people from seven countries from entering the United States.",
        "President Trump\u2019s Twitter assault on the \u201c judge\u201d who put a nationwide hold on the president\u2019s executive order on immigration has motivated Democrats to challenge Trump\u2019s choice for the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, on an important but elusive issue. Is Gorsuch independent enough, they ask, to stand up to the president who picked him? As the legal battle over Trump\u2019s immigration directive shows, Gorsuch\u2019s nomination lands at a time when the Supreme Court is likely to be called upon to review what Trump already has shown to be a broad reliance on executive power.",
        "As President Trump weathered his first two weeks in office, a surprising number of roadblocks to his agenda cropped up from another Washington, more than 2, 500 miles away. Acting swiftly and with a united front, leaders from the Evergreen State have marshaled a powerful resistance to Trump\u2019s administration \u2014 the combination of a populace, outspoken Democratic lawmakers, legal efforts spearheaded by a resolute attorney general and support from several tech companies wary of Trump\u2019s policies.

        "Michael V. Hayden, a principal at the Chertoff Group and visiting professor at George Mason University\u2019s Schar School of Policy and Government, was director of the National Security Agency from 1999 to 2005 and the Central Intelligence Agency from 2006 to 2009. President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration was poorly implemented and . To be fair, it would have been hard to explain since it was not the product of intelligence and security professionals demanding change, but rather policy, political and ideological personalities close to the president fulfilling a campaign promise to deal with a threat they had overhyped.",
        "I had intended to use this space to detail how the chaotic events of the past week had persuaded President Trump to put into practice a more rigorous process to avoid calamities like last week\u2019s immigration executive order. But that subject will have to wait for another day, since the 45th president decided to use Twitter this weekend to repeatedly question the legitimacy of a sitting federal judge. When a president tweets insults at a Hollywood star, the dignity of his office is tarnished.",
        "The movement that Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has inspired against him is broad, passionate, engaged and determined. Its prospects depend upon highlighting a set of principles that can unite an American majority already appalled by what Trump is doing to our country. While almost everything in our politics these days has a strongly partisan cast, the forces cannot be defined by party or ideology. That\u2019s true even though, with a sadly short list of exceptions, Republicans in the House and Senate have been timid in speaking out against Trump\u2019s overturning of norms and values.",
        "President Trump pledges to dismantle much of the regulatory state \u2014 the amalgam of federal rules, directives and warnings that, aside from advancing many policy goals, are also alleged to have reduced the competitiveness of the U. S. economy. His objective is to cut government regulation by about 70 percent. It will be a tough target to reach. But Trump seems determined to try. Last week, he signaled an overhaul in the financial regulation regime adopted after the financial crisis.",
        "The Trump administration has launched a raft of reckless and wrongheaded foreign policy initiatives in its first two weeks, from banning entry by citizens of a country that is its partner in war (Iraq) to needlessly alienating the leaders of two of the closest U. S. allies (Mexico and Australia). One thing Trump has decidedly not done, however, is downgrade the participation of the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the deliberations of the National Security Council. You may have heard and read otherwise, repeatedly."
