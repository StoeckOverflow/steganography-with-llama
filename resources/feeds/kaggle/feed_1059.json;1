        "\u201cPRESIDENT TRUMP continues to be respectful and supportive of L. G. B. T. Q. rights,\u201d the White House wrote in a statement last Tuesday. \u201cThe president is proud to have been the first ever G. O. P. nominee to mention the L. G. B. T. Q. community in his nomination acceptance speech, pledging then to protect the community from violence and oppression. \u201d The occasion for this fine statement was an announcement that Mr. Trump would not roll back protections for LGBT people working in the federal government or for federal contractors.",
        "President Trump offered a fulsome defense of Russian President Vladi mir Putin over the weekend, leaving Republican lawmakers frustrated and flummoxed yet again by the president\u2019s warm feelings toward the rival nation. In a Fox News interview, Trump, who during the campaign repeatedly praised Putin, again said that he respected the Russian leader and hoped to get along with Moscow, and he seemed to equate the United States with its adversary when pressed by host Bill O\u2019Reilly, who said: \u201cBut he\u2019s a killer, though. Putin\u2019s a killer.",
        "BEIRUT \u2014 President Trump\u2019s tough talk on Iran is winning him friends in the Arab world, but it also carries a significant risk of conflict with a U. S. rival that is now more powerful than at any point since the creation of the Islamic republic nearly 40 years ago. With its warning last week that Iran is \u201con notice,\u201d the Trump administration signaled a sharp departure from the policies of President Obama, whose focus on pursuing a nuclear deal with Iran eclipsed historic U. S.",
        "The day before his inauguration as president, Donald Trump scanned the ballroom during a celebratory luncheon at his Washington hotel: \u201cWhere\u2019s Kevin?\u201d he asked. \u201cThere\u2019s my Kevin. \u201d It was a brief but telling acknowledgment of a political relationship between two GOP on opposite ends of Pennsylvania Avenue \u2014 Trump and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( .) \u2014 that has set the stage for a rapid legislative blitz in the early months of the Trump administration. McCarthy, the No.",
        "Once merely embarrassing and ridiculous, the annual White House correspondents\u2019 dinner is poised to tip over into journalistic . It\u2019s time to stick a fork in it. The nerd prom is a glitzy party \u2014 now a blitz of related parties \u2014 in which Washington, Hollywood and New York media types schmooze it up with the public officials that some of them are supposed to cover, while looking over their shoulders to see whether Helen Mirren is really looking as fabulous as everyone says.",
        "NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d has no shortage of white guys to play White House press secretary Sean Spicer. But this week producers went outside of their cast roster to fill the role with a guest appearance by Melissa McCarthy \u2014 who absolutely crushed it. McCarthy displayed her commanding comedic presence as a unhinged Spicer who scolded reporters in a sketch that stretched well beyond seven minutes. She didn\u2019t just imitate a person \u2014 McCarthy embodied an outrageous character so effectively that, judging by the studio audience\u2019s delayed reaction at her presence, she was unrecognizable at first.",
        "At a recent reception at WAMU, a couple dozen of the Washington public radio sta tion\u2019s most active community supporters gathered to meet the man succeeding a legend. Many were fans of Diane Rehm yet open to change \u2014 theoretically. Rehm had built a loyal following over 37 years with her singular blend of charm and steel. \u201cThe Diane Rehm Show\u201d aired on 198 stations and reached 2. 8 million listeners a week by the time she signed off in December.",
        "Standing Rock Sioux Tribe officials said this weekend that although they were working with federal authorities to stabilize the situation at the Dakota Access Pipeline protest site, they were not calling on law enforcement to forcibly remove activists there. After months of protests, both tribal officials and residents in the town of Cannon Ball, N. D. have asked those opposed to completion of the controversial, pipeline to leave. A few hundred activists remain, both on the Standing Rock Sioux\u2019s reservation and on neighboring land.",
        "A federal appeals court will hear arguments Tuesday on whether to restore President Trump\u2019s controversial immigration order, marking a critical juncture for the president\u2019s directive temporarily barring refugees and those from seven countries from entering the United States. The hearing, which will be conducted by telephone, is to review an order by a lower court judge to put Trump\u2019s directive on hold.",
        "With tears in their eyes and tired smiles, Tareq and Ammar Aziz embraced their father at Washington Dulles International Airport on Monday morning. The reunion was a in the making for the brothers from Yemen, whose hopes to live in the United States seemed uncertain, even impossible, after President Trump signed an executive order banning travelers from their home country and others. As they reentered the airport they had been turned back from late last month, joining family members and lawyers who had helped ensure their journey, they expressed only gratitude.",
        "Speaking to the U. S. Central Command on Monday, President Trump went off his prepared remarks to make a truly stunning claim: The media was intentionally covering up reports of terrorist attacks. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen what happened in Paris, and Nice. All over Europe, it\u2019s happening,\u201d he said to the assembled military leaders. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten to a point where it\u2019s not even being reported. And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn\u2019t want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that.",
        "Virtually all Democratic senators are expected to vote against President Trump\u2019s picks to lead the departments of Education, Justice, Health and Human Services, Labor and Treasury and his top budget nominee \u2014 a historic rebuke of a president\u2019s Cabinet selections. The Senate is scheduled to continue confirming Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees this week, with a vote scheduled for Tuesday to approve Betsy DeVos, nominated to run the Education Department.

        "Tom Brady\u2019s ultimate victory is over the whole dumb, NFL culture. A man completed the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history, and he walked off the field without a limp or a chip on his shoulder. How about that?",
        "Building supplies company 84 Lumber tackled a heap of controversy over the weekend with its \u2014 yet inconclusive \u2014 Super Bowl ad featuring a Mexican mother and daughter embarking on a difficult journey north that left the viewer wondering where they ended up. At the end of the ponderous tale, script appears on the screen: \u201cThe will to succeed is always welcome here. \u201d That wasn\u2019t the full story. The Super Bowl ad asked viewers to visit the 84 Lumber website if they wanted the rest of the story.",
        "Super Bowl LI may have been full of surprises, but the commercials? Not so much. It was a lackluster year with many forgettable ads. (It didn\u2019t help that several of the Super Bowl\u2019s most reliably funny advertisers, including Doritos and Butterfingers, dropped out.) Other advertisers \u2014 with the exception of a few that were motivated to tackle the recent immigration order \u2014 seemed disinclined to take risks. It\u2019s been a fraught couple of months, so perhaps that\u2019s why this year\u2019s commercials seemed a little more tepid than usual.",
        "Rarely is the question asked: Is our Cabinet secretaries learning? And if we is being honest with ourself, we says: No, they is not. Today\u2019s lesson: the education of Betsy DeVos. DeVos, a major Republican donor, is nearing the end of her ordeal to be confirmed as education secretary, and it has been a grizzly tale. Republicans, apparently recognizing the billionaire\u2019s lack of familiarity with the rudiments of education policy, tried to shield DeVos from public view. They scheduled her testimony in the evening and limited questions. But this did not save the heiress from getting schooled.",
        "During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump accused Barack Obama of treating America\u2019s adversaries \u201cwith tender love and care\u201d while our allies were \u201csnubbed and criticized by an administration that lacks moral clarity. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve picked fights with our oldest friends,\u201d Trump declared in his April 2016 foreign policy speech, adding \u201cWe\u2019ve had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies. \u201d Trump was absolutely right. From Iran to Cuba, Obama bent over backwards to court our adversaries. At the same time, he mistreated our closest allies \u2014 allowing Israel to get bullied by the U. N.",
        "Over the weekend, President Trump unleashed a barrage of tweets attacking the judiciary for putting his immigration ban on hold. In one of them, Trump described federal district court judge James Robart, who first put a stay on his executive order, as a \u201c judge. \u201d Then, when an appeals court declined to lift that stay, Trump went even further: Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad! \u2014 Donald J.",
        "Vian Dakhil is a member of the Iraqi parliament and is being presented the 2016 Lantos Human Rights Prize. WASHINGTON \u2014 More than two years ago, the Islamic State launched a forced conversion campaign against the Yazidi population of the Sinjar region in northern Iraq. Its fighters killed more than 5, 000 Yazidis, piling them into mass graves, abducted some 3, 600 women and sold them into sexual slavery, and drove more than 500, 000 from their ancestral lands. These are statistics, but for me this is deeply personal. I am a Yazidi, and these are my people.",
        "The Trump administration\u2019s statements and the ragged leaks from the White House have been getting a lot of attention, but, even if they make compelling headlines, they are more or less routine. Remember this: We are just two weeks into the Trump administration, and with the exception of personnel appointments, nothing that has happened so far will matter much by later this spring. Plus, it will take until at least May for many of the empty chairs throughout the administration to be filled and for the executive agencies to start functioning in a more normal fashion.",
        "AS THE Trump administration fought in court to revive its temporary ban on entry by refugees as well as travelers from seven countries, the president persisted in perversely suggesting that the judicial branch will be responsible for any terrorist attack carried out by what he portrayed as the violent hordes clamoring to enter the country. By conflating a dangerous fiction about immigrants with blatant disrespect for an equal branch of government, President Trump fans the xenophobic flames he did so much to ignite during the presidential campaign.",
        "If you would like to see a man struggle, witness Vice President Pence: Pence was asked on \u201dFace the Nation\u201d to account for President Trump having likened Vladimir Putin\u2019s alleged killing of political opponents to the United States\u2019. Trump had told Bill O\u2019Reilly: \u201dWhat, you think our country\u2019s so innocent?\u201d CBS\u2019s John Dickerson asked Pence, \u201dDo you agree?\u201d And Pence had to draw a long, pronounced breath.",
        "JERUSALEM \u2014 Israel\u2019s parliament passed a contentious law late Monday that allows the state to seize land privately owned by Palestinians in the West Bank and grant the properties to Jewish settlements for their exclusive use. The measure is designed to protect homes in Jewish settlements, built on private Palestinian property \u201cin good faith or at the state\u2019s instruction,\u201d from possible evacuation and demolition. Thousands of homes in dozens of settlements and outposts may now be protected, at least temporarily. The bill is likely headed for a high court challenge.",
        "This post has been updated with a newly discovered third instance of Conway citing the \u201cBowling Green attack\u201d \u2014 with TMZ. Kellyanne Conway thinks she took too much flak for citing a nonexistent \u201cBowling Green massacre\u201d to justify President Trump\u2019s travel ban. She said she simply meant to say \u201cBowling Green terrorists,\u201d and she later said, \u201cI misspoke one word. \u201d Except now she doesn\u2019t appear to have misspoken at all; she seems to have believed that the Bowling Green massacre was a real thing. How do we know?",
        "The Federal Trade Commission said Monday that Vizio used 11 million televisions to spy on its customers. The television maker agreed to pay $2. 2 million to settle a case with the FTC and the New Jersey attorney general\u2019s office after the agencies accused it of secretly collecting \u2014 and selling \u2014 data about its customers\u2019 locations, demographics and viewing habits.

        "The state of North Carolina already has lost out on hosting a number of sporting events because of House Bill 2, which mandates that transgender people use the bathroom corresponding with their birth gender in facilities and bans North Carolina municipalities from enacting policies. This academic year alone, the NCAA moved seven events out of the state, including and games of the NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournament that were scheduled for Greensboro. The ACC relocated 10 championships, including its football championship game in Charlotte. The NBA, meanwhile, moved this season\u2019s Game from Charlotte to New Orleans.",
        "Why is he so tired, Jackie Mann wondered, not for the first time, as Evan, the middle of her three children, wandered off to his bedroom to take an nap. Small for his age, the seemed to fall asleep easily and anywhere: in the car on the way to soccer or gymnastics, on the afternoons he came straight home from school, while doing his homework and, once, while waiting to see the pediatrician. But his parents noticed that Evan seemed decidedly more energetic on the weekends in the semirural community outside Oakland, Calif. where the family lives.",
        "A few months ago, conservative talk show host Tomi Lahren had a surprisingly civil chat with Trevor Noah on \u201cThe Daily Show. \u201d On Friday, Lahren appeared on another liberal talk show \u2014 HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time With Bill Maher. \u201d How did the discussion go?

(Dorothea of Congress) The border between the United States and Mexico has been in the headlines for a while now.

The panel from the U. S.
