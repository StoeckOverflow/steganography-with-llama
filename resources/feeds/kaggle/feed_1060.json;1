The Army\u2019s intention to grant a easement under Lake Oahe, which came in a court filing over an ongoing federal environmental review of the controversial project, was immediately hailed by congressional Republicans and decried by members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and other opponents of the pipeline.

        "No attempt to ridicule Donald Trump\u2019s controversies \u2014 from his remarks about Mexicans to the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape \u2014 could derail his successful road to the White House. Trump acknowledged as much a year ago when he spoke about supporters so loyal that \u201cI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn\u2019t lose any voters. \u201d But that was candidate Trump. Now Trump is running the government as a president who cares very deeply about appearances \u2014 so much so that a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sketch could affect how he does it.",
        "The Senate confirmed Betsy DeVos as education secretary Tuesday by the narrowest of margins, with Vice President Pence casting a historic tiebreaking vote after senators deadlocked over her fitness for the job. DeVos now takes the helm of the Education Department with questions about whether and how the polarizing fight over her confirmation will affect her power to advance the Trump administration\u2019s agenda. The entire Democratic caucus of 48 senators voted against DeVos, as did two Republicans, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, who said they did not think that DeVos was qualified for the job.",
        "If you\u2019ve been paying attention at all to the controversy surrounding the Senate confirmation of Michigan billionaire Betsy DeVos as education secretary in President Trump\u2019s administration, you probably know these things: *She is a billionaire. *She supports charter schools and vouchers. *She said that schools should be allowed to have guns to protect from \u201cpotential grizzlies. \u201d *She never went to public school.

        "Of the many puzzles posed by President Trump\u2019s administration, the role of the National Security Council is among the trickiest. The NSC usually tries to act as an \u201chonest broker\u201d among Cabinet agencies. But how will it function under a headstrong president who sees his role as disruptor and ? This challenge falls to national security adviser Michael Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general who holds a position once filled by such luminaries as Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft.

        "The English language was unprepared for the attak. It was destined to loose. And, inevitably, it chocked. The Trump White House on Monday night, attempting to demonstrate that the media had ignored terrorism, released a list of 78 \u201cunderreported\u201d attacks.

        "WHEN A federal judge halted President Trump\u2019s immigration executive order last Friday, the news was at first little more than a terse line on phone screens and chyrons, implying a thousand unanswered questions: What holes did the judge find in the Trump administration\u2019s arguments? To what degree was the decision based on the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of due process or of equal protection? On the separation of church and state? Why did District Court Judge James L. Robart go further than other federal judges had before him in stopping the executive order\u2019s ?",

After years of Republican yammering about the urgent need to repeal the Affordable Care Act and months of fruitless pursuit of an alternative, President Trump now says he may not unveil a replacement this year at all.
