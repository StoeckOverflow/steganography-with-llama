        "I asked the exact same question of every single bride who hired me to work their wedding as a professional bridesmaid. It wasn\u2019t about their biggest fear or how much money they had left in their budget. I asked how they met their fiance. Part of me wanted to know because it was a great way to kick off a conversation with a stranger who was hiring me to be their bridesmaid for the day, and part of me wanted to know for my own selfish reasons. For most of my time in this job, I\u2019ve been single.",
        "The NFL\u2019s offseason has arrived. The confetti is done falling on the New England Patriots\u2019 fifth Super Bowl victory. The testimonials to the reaffirmed greatness of quarterback Tom Brady have been made, and Coach Bill Belichick already has lamented that the Patriots are five weeks behind in their preparations for next season. So it is, indeed, on to the 2017 season, for the Patriots and everyone else. But first, there is offseason work to be done over the next seven months.",
        "KABUL \u2014 Six staffers of the International Committee of the Red Cross were killed and two others are missing after their convoy was ambushed by unidentified gunmen in northern Afghanistan, the humanitarian agency said Wednesday. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, the deadliest against the ICRC in Afghanistan, but local officials blamed the Islamic State, which is known to have militants operating in the area. The Taliban, which also is fighting the U. S. government in Kabul, denied any involvement in the ambush.",
        "John Oliver\u2019s HBO show \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d returns to HBO on Sunday, but he has been surprisingly okay with staying off the air for almost three months. \u201cUntil Inauguration Day nothing was really happening,\u201d Oliver told Stephen Colbert during an appearance on \u201cThe Late Show\u201d Tuesday. \u201cIt was just being tied to a train track, watching the train coming.

        "(Swarat Ghosh) More often than not, photography coming out of India tends to focus on the \u201cexotic. \u201d We\u2019ve seen the pictures many times before \u2014 people performing religious rites in the Ganges River or huge gatherings like the Kumb Mela. So it is refreshing to see work that diverges from this path. Swarat Ghosh\u2019s photographs of street scenes in India do just that. Far from the spectacles we are used to seeing, Ghosh roams the streets transforming the ordinary and banal into the magical.",
        "A federal appeals court panel has maintained the freeze on President Trump\u2019s controversial immigration order, meaning previously barred refugees and citizens from seven countries can continue entering the United States. In a unanimous, opinion, three judges with the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit flatly rejected the government\u2019s argument that the suspension of the order should be lifted immediately for national security reasons and forcefully asserted their ability to serve as a check on the president\u2019s power. The judges wrote that any suggestion that they couldn\u2019t \u201cruns contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy.",
        "President Trump\u2019s official counselor, Kellyanne Conway, was \u201ccounseled\u201d after she told TV audiences to \u201cgo buy Ivanka\u2019s stuff,\u201d the White House said Thursday. Legal experts said Conway had broken a key ethics law banning federal employees from using their public office to endorse products. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Thursday that Conway \u201chas been counseled,\u201d but offered no other comment.",
        "President Trump lashed out Thursday at a Democratic senator who publicly shared that Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch had told him he found Trump\u2019s attacks on the federal judiciary \u201cdisheartening\u201d and \u201cdemoralizing. \u201d Taking to Twitter in the morning, Trump tried to question the credibility of Sen. Richard Blumenthal ( .) by referring to a 2010 acknowledgment by the attorney general that he had misspoken about having served in Vietnam, when in fact he had never gone to war. \u201cSen.",
        "Donald Trump took on Sen. John McCain\u2019s status as a war hero and won the GOP nomination anyway.

        "As foreign leaders have recoiled and recalibrated amid President Trump\u2019s bluster and bullying on the world stage, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan has taken another tack \u2014 offering the new American president an embrace. Like most foreign capitals, Tokyo was shocked at Trump\u2019s upset victory and scrambled to make sense of the outcome. Japan was one of Trump\u2019s primary foreign policy targets during the campaign as he denounced a hefty trade imbalance and suggested that the longtime U. S. ally in Asia was freeloading off America\u2019s security umbrella.",
        "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to travel with me, you cannot precisely characterize the area I live in,\u201d Keith Olbermann wrote in an email. \u201cNothing more detailed than \u2018midtown\u2019 . . .

        "About eight years ago, there was a knock on Guadalupe Garc\u00eda de Rayos\u2019s door. Authorities had come to arrest the undocumented mother of two U. S. children, a Mexican native who had lived north of the border since she was 14. The Phoenix mother was detained for months and eventually ordered to be sent back to Mexico. But for the subsequent years, after she appealed her voluntary deportation, Garc\u00eda de Rayos was allowed to remain in the United States, as long as she checked in once a year, and then every six months.",
        "White House press secretary Sean Spicer turned it up to 11 at his daily press briefing Thursday. Spicer, who has come under massive scrutiny in the wake of a biting \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sketch about him and several leaks about how displeased President Trump is with his performance, battled with reporters for 30 minutes \u2014 seeking out confrontation wherever he could find it.

        "In response to the president\u2019s unprecedented attack on a company declining to do business with a family member, Nordstrom answered President Trump\u2019s accusation that it was treating Ivanka Trump unfairly. \u201cTo reiterate what we\u2019ve already shared when asked, we made this decision based on performance,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cOver the past year, and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn\u2019t make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now. \u201d In other words, customers are just not into Ivanka.",
        "Mike Allen of Axios counseled journalists to appreciate these times. \u201cEnjoy this \u2014 soak it in,\u201d said Allen in a chat with Breitbart News. Sorry, but there\u2019s not much to enjoy. This week, President Trump claimed that the murder rate had reached a high. A meager exertion on the keyboard was required to debunk that miserable falsehood, clearly designed to gin up enthusiasm for Trump\u2019s agenda. The president also claimed that international terrorism has reached a point where it\u2019s \u201cnot even being reported\u201d by the media. No electronic exertion was required to debunk that conspiratorial representation.",
        "Donald Trump is making America read again. It started during the campaign, when J. D. Vance\u2019s \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d became the text explaining Trump\u2019s appeal among white voters. It continued last month, when a public spat between Trump and Rep. John Lewis ( .) boosted sales of Lewis\u2019s trilogy, \u201cMarch,\u201d and memoir, \u201cWalking With the Wind. \u201d And then came the craze, when Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway immortalized herself in America\u2019s political lexicon by describing White House falsehoods as \u201calternative facts\u201d \u2014 and George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d shot to the top of Amazon\u2019s sales ranking.",

        "Even though it is proceeding mostly out of view, the race for the chairman of the Democratic National Committee is important and it says something about the transformation of the Democratic Party. The phenomenon of Bernie Sanders during the 2016 campaign made it clear that the Democratic Party has fully abandoned the Clinton era. Hillary Clinton was the last gasp of an era and not the beginning of anything. \u00c2 Traditional Democratic policies and the cerebral, leftist character of the Obama administration have left the Democrats unfulfilled.",
        "Mitch McConnell\u2019s decision to silence Elizabeth Warren on the Senate floor earlier this week drew massive media attention \u2014 and outrage among partisans of all stripes. By contrast, few people paid much attention to the speech Florida Sen. Marco Rubio gave in the aftermath of the shushing of Warren. They should. Rubio\u2019s speech was a plea for civility in the Senate, a warning that if civilized debate dies in the Senate, it will die in the broader society too.

        "Organic food has never been so popular among American consumers. Ironically, that\u2019s bad news for the brand that made organic a household name \u2014 namely, the Whole Foods. On Wednesday, Whole Foods reported what is arguably its worst performance in a decade, announcing its sixth consecutive quarter of falling sales and cutting its outlook for the year. The company is closing nine stores, the most it has ever closed at one time. A mere 16 months ago, Whole Foods predicted it would grow its 470 U. S. locations to more than 1, 200.",

Temperatures that were in the 50s and 60s on Wednesday are now in the 30s \u2014 soon to be 20s \u2014 as the storm draws in cold air from the north. More than 3, 000 flights were canceled because of the storm, including some in Washington, which avoided the snow but not the travel impacts.

S. sanctions against Russia with that country\u2019s ambassador to the United States during the month before President Trump took office, contrary to public assertions by Trump officials, current and former U. S. officials said. Flynn\u2019s communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were interpreted by some senior U. S. officials as an inappropriate and potentially illegal signal to the Kremlin that it could expect a reprieve from sanctions that were being imposed by the Obama administration in late December to punish Russia for its alleged interference in the 2016 election."
