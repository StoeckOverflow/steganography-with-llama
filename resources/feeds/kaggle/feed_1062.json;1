        "MOSCOW \u2014 President Trump\u2019s heady campaign rhetoric about possible detente with Russia is coming to terms with the realities of his chaotic new administration. Details emerged Thursday about a telephone call held between Russian President Vladi mir Putin in which Trump blasted a treaty negotiated under the Obama administration that limits nuclear weapons deployments \u2014 after Trump reportedly paused the call with Putin to ask an aide about the treaty. According to a report by the Reuters news agency, Trump then denounced the New START treaty as favoring Russia.",
        "MURFREESBORO, Tenn. \u2014 Republicans in deep red congressional districts spent the week navigating massive crowds and hostile questions at their town hall meetings \u2014 an early indication of how progressive opposition movements are mobilizing against the agenda of the GOP and President Trump. Angry constituents swarmed events held by Rep. Jason Chaffetz ( ) Rep. Diane Black ( .) Rep. Justin Amash ( .) and Rep. Tom McClintock ( . ). They filled the rooms that had been reserved for them; in Utah and Tennessee, scores of activists were locked out.",
        "We know President Trump is concerned with appearances \u2014 especially when he\u2019s on television, or in front of news photographers or large crowds. We also know that President Trump is concerned with hands \u2014 how large they are, how strong they are \u2014 just look at them! Trump is also a germaphobe. He initially shunned shaking hands with supporters on the campaign trail. As president, protocol compels him to shake a lot of hands, though.",
        "It\u2019s always just enough, isn\u2019t it? There is always just enough fraud in whatever contest President Trump happens to be talking about to have made the difference in the election. On Thursday, it was New Hampshire, a state that Trump lost by just less than 3, 000 votes. Trump apparently raised that loss during a conversation with a number of senators that was intended to be focused on his nominee for the Supreme Court.",

        "When people of faith drop to their knees for nightly prayer, many, I suspect, find themselves struggling with the often preached injunction to pray for those in positions of public trust. Are we, they may be asking, to pray for President Trump, the architect of and measures grounded in paranoia and fear of the stranger? That description of Trump\u2019s proposals was supplied by the Rev. Randolph Marshall Hollerith, dean of Washington National Cathedral. Are they to pray for people placed by Trump in positions of civil authority, such as nationalist Stephen K.",
        "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) was right to invoke Rule 19 against Sen Elizabeth Warren ( .) for her personal harangue against her \u201cfriend and colleague\u201d Sen. Jeff Sessions ( . ). Dignity is flowing out of Washington and Warren is doing more than her part as she desperately tries to prove she isn\u2019t just another tiresome Hillary Clinton. What a pretentious, grandstanding phony. Warren is likely running for president in 2020, and she is trying to rally the embittered left and Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s ( .) crowd to her side.",
        "I\u2019ve heard it scores of times from Americans frightened, angry or depressed about President Trump: \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d I recommend to each of them the same regimen I follow myself: Exercise regularly, spend time with family and drink a quart of Everclear every night. But such as the practitioners call it, only goes so far. For much of America \u2014 the majority of the country that did not vote for Donald Trump \u2014 the election has brought about what\u2019s known as a \u201ccollective trauma\u201d not unlike the 2001 terrorist attacks.",
        "Asli Aydintasbas is a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations and a columnist for Turkish daily Cumhuriyet. Who would have thought that Germany, long led by a leader seen as the symbol of the continent\u2019s reserve and realism, would finally emerge at the forefront of the struggle for democracy? Oh no, I am not talking about the European panic about the ways and means of President Trump and the new role forced upon Berlin as the fortress of the Western liberal order \u2014 although all of that is certainly happening.",
        "President Trump pledged Friday that his administration remains committed to maintaining the United States\u2019 security alliance with Japan, aiming to calm jitters in Tokyo over his inflammatory rhetoric on the campaign trail. In a news conference with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the White House, Trump called the alliance the \u201ccornerstone of peace and stability in the Pacific region,\u201d and he vowed to make ties between the two countries \u201ceven closer. \u201d Trump\u2019s remarks on the alliance, which hewed closely to statements of previous U.

        "Federal officials have held private talks in recent days with attorneys for President Trump s real estate company to address a potential violation of Trump s lease with the government for his new luxury hotel near the White House, but the two sides have so far failed to reach a resolution, according to documents and people familiar with the discussions. At issue is a clause in the lease barring an elected official ? from receiving any benefit ? from the agreement, which Trump signed with the General Services Administration in 2013 long before he became a presidential candidate.",

        "NOIDA, India \u2014 As Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was announcing his sudden decision to ban all large currency notes on a crisp November night, Vijay Shekhar Sharma was being feted by Forbes magazine in Mumbai. His phone was on silent mode. Halfway through the red carpet event, Sharma turned on his phone, which exploded with calls, texts and notifications from his office at Paytm, India\u2019s largest business.

        "Education Secretary Betsy DeVos encountered protesters Friday morning outside a D. C. middle school and found her way barred as she tried to enter through a side door, forcing her to retreat into a government vehicle as a man shouted \u201cShame!\u201d Eventually, DeVos made her way inside for an event starting at about 10 a. m. that included the D. C. schools chancellor and others. The event was closed to the media. But the demonstration outside Jefferson Middle School Academy was a further sign that DeVos remains a polarizing figure in the education world days after she took office.",
        "Peer at a map of the Arctic and it glows fluorescent red. The warmth, compared to normal, is again nearly off the charts. It\u2019s crazy and perhaps unsettling, but we have seen it coming. In my Feb. 1 story, \u2018Beyond the extreme\u2019: Scientists marvel at \u2018increasingly nonnatural\u2019 Arctic warmth, I stated computer models predicted yet another round of incredible warmth in a week\u2019s time.

        "A super PAC formed to reelect Barack Obama in 2012 is driving activists to congressional town halls. Veterans of Bill Clinton\u2019s administration are joining marches and plotting bigger ones for the spring. Democratic senators who had befriended Jeff Sessions in the Senate voted \u2014 47 to 1 \u2014 against his nomination for attorney general.

        "As a young conservative in liberal Santa Monica, Calif. Stephen Miller clashed frequently with his high school, often calling in to a national radio show to lambaste administrators for promoting multiculturalism, allowing morning announcements and failing to require recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. Miller\u2019s outrage did not appear to subside after he graduated. As a Duke University sophomore, Miller penned a column, titled \u201cSanta Monica High\u2019s Multicultural Fistfights,\u201d in which he ripped his alma mater as a \u201ccenter for political indoctrination.",
        "JUPITER, Fla. \u2014 President Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe largely disappeared from public view for more than three hours here Saturday at one of Trump\u2019s signature golf courses for what was billed as some fairways diplomacy. Trump, wearing a white Make America Great Again hat, appeared to be Abe in a picture posted on Twitter and other social media by Trump, as the two leaders enjoyed a shared passion for golf. They were joined by Ernie Els, a professional golfer from South Africa.",
        "While President Trump had an army of television surrogates appearing regularly on television during the campaign season, just one dominates the cable news cycle these days: Kellyanne Conway. Whether it\u2019s arguing for \u201calternative facts\u201d (read: \u201cnot facts\u201d) or simply attempting to spin the news in ways that are positive for the new administration, Conway has become the undisputed cable news voice of the Trump White House \u2014 and, in a way, Trump\u2019s voice on cable networks.",
        "Michelle DeMello walked into the clerk\u2019s office in Colorado thinking for sure someone would save her. She was 16 and pregnant.

She didn\u2019t think she had the right to say no to the marriage after the mess she felt she\u2019d made. \u201cI could be the example of the shining whore in town, or I could be what everybody wanted me to be at that moment and save my family a lot of honor,\u201d DeMello said.",
        "Many Americans were outraged when President Trump put the United States and Russia on the same moral plane last weekend; he told Bill O\u2019Reilly that Vladimir Putin may be a \u201ckiller,\u201d but \u201cthere are a lot of killers. You think our country\u2019s so innocent?\u201d Condemnation rippled across pages and social media.

        "President Trump wants the federal government to start publishing weekly lists of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. An executive order on \u201cEnhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States\u201d that Trump signed last month calls for the reports, which would also identify \u201csanctuary jurisdictions,\u201d cities and counties where local law enforcement authorities don\u2019t report immigration status violations to the federal government. But from my own work building a national database of crimes by police officers, I\u2019ve learned that collecting and distributing reliable stats in real time may be much harder than Trump thinks.",
        "The White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner is not a mood ring. It doesn\u2019t care if President Trump \u2014 or any president \u2014 likes, dislikes, celebrates, scorns or ignores White House reporters. The annual gala does not indicate, illustrate or represent the relationship between the White House and the reporters who cover it. It is an institution that celebrates one bedrock American value, the First Amendment, and two journalistic goals: to highlight excellent reporting and to award scholarships to the next generation of American journalists. That has always been true.",
        "Like a lot of Americans, I\u2019ve never been particularly political. I\u2019ve never voted in a midterm election. I\u2019ve never voted in a local race, never voted for mayor. I don\u2019t recall voting ever, except in presidential elections. I\u2019d read political articles and keep up with the news, but I didn\u2019t do much research before heading to the polls every four years. My Facebook feed was mostly cat photos. But then President Trump was elected, and he nominated Betsy DeVos to be secretary of education.",

        "Fear and panic have gripped America\u2019s immigrant community as reports circulate that federal agents have become newly aggressive under President Trump, who campaigned for office with a vow to create a \u201cdeportation force. \u201d Federal officials insist they have not made fundamental changes in enforcement actions, and they deny stopping people randomly at checkpoints or conducting \u201csweeps\u201d of locations where undocumented immigrants are common. But anxiety among immigrants spiked this week after the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency conducted a series of enforcement actions in large metropolitan areas.",
        "As news networks have scrambled to put cameras in congressional town hall meetings, a few of their attendees and speakers have earned short bursts of fame \u2014 or infamy.

        "A permanent U.
