        "President Trump says \u201dSaturday Night Live\u201d is \u201dunwatchable.\u201d But, the veterans advocacy group VoteVets is so sure Trump tunes in that it has reportedly purchased advertising time on this weekend\u2019s episode, in an effort to deliver a message to the Oval Office. VoteVets debuted an ad called \u201dAct Like One\u201d on MSNBC\u2019s \u201dMorning Joe\u201d Monday and made clear that its strategy is to speak directly to the president, through his television screen.",
        "NEW HAVEN, Conn. \u2014 Yale University will rename one of its residential colleges, replacing the name of an alumnus remembered as an advocate of slavery with that of an alumna who was a pioneering mathematician and computer scientist who helped transform the way people use technology. \u201cThe minute that the announcement came out, people stuck their heads out of the window and yelled \u2018Wahoo! \u2019\u201d said Julia Adams, a sociology professor who is head of the Grace Murray Hopper College.",
        "By the time Th\u00e9o arrived at a French emergency room on Feb. 2, he was covered in blood. Doctors discovered that his primary injury had been caused by a police truncheon, one that had been forced inside the man\u2019s rectum during a violent encounter with multiple officers in a suburb north of Paris. Th\u00e9o, a French youth worker whose last name has not been released, maintained that the injury \u2014 which required major surgery to repair \u2014 was inflicted intentionally and that he was the victim of a horrific sexual assault.",
        "A congressional report on the terrorist threat posed by airport \u201cinsiders\u201d says the Transportation Security Administration, airport operators and airlines must do a better job of screening workers such as baggage handlers or cleaning crews for possible security threats. It\u2019s also treading depressingly familiar ground. The report, released this week by the House Homeland Security Committee\u2019s majority staff, cites several cases going back as far as 2008 in which aviation workers, former employees or contractors were recruited to fight for ISIS or other terrorist groups or engaged in efforts to smuggle firearms or other contraband aboard aircraft.",
        "BRAWLEY, Calif. \u2014 Next to a field of alfalfa is a roadside sign celebrating the things that define life here, 170 miles southeast of Los Angeles: service clubs (Lions, Kiwanis, etc.) the club, the high school sports booster club. Down the street is a sign for the annual rodeo and parade. In many ways Brawley is a typical farming community, but there is one distinction that makes it unique: It is the unofficial earthquake capital of California, maybe the nation.",
        "You made the fitness resolution while raising your glass of bubbly on New Year\u2019s Eve, and you\u2019ve worked out three times a week for more than a month. But the scale. Is. Not. Budging. Isn\u2019t it possible that you\u2019re actually fitter \u2014 that you have more lean body mass and less fat \u2014 even though the scale hasn\u2019t changed? Indeed, it is. This is why trainers such as D. C.",

        "I\u2019m walking down a long, paved sidewalk in early March, with a practice baseball field on my left and a grove of trees on my right. I\u2019m worrying about the snow that fell as I left Washington the night before, worrying about work and bills and the hassles of everyday life, worrying about the sunscreen I left at home.",
        "President Trump has embarked on the most aggressive campaign against government regulation in a generation, joining with Republican lawmakers to roll back rules already on the books and limit the ability of federal regulators to impose new ones. After just a few weeks in office, the new administration is targeting dozens of policies, using both legislative and executive tactics. The fallout is already rippling across the federal bureaucracy and throughout the U. S.",
        "The White House is pursuing several options to reinstate President Trump\u2019s travel ban on all refugees and travelers from seven nations, fighting back against what one top adviser on Sunday called \u201cjudicial usurpation of power. \u201d White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, the author of the controversial executive order, said the administration was weighing several legal options after the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously on Thursday against reinstating the travel ban, which had been blocked temporarily by a federal judge in Washington state.",
        "One of President Trump\u2019s longtime friends made a striking move on Sunday: After talking privately with the president over drinks late Friday, Christopher Ruddy publicly argued that Trump should replace his White House chief of staff. \u201cA lot of people have been saying, \u2018Look, Donald has some problems,\u2019 and I think he realizes that he\u2019s got to make some changes going forward,\u201d Ruddy said in an interview with The Washington Post. Ruddy went on to detail his critique of White House chief of staff Reince Priebus: \u201cIt\u2019s my view that Reince is the problem.",
        "President Trump\u2019s national security adviser Michael Flynn faced strong criticism on Sunday for allegedly discussing U. S. sanctions against Russia with that country\u2019s ambassador to the United States, with even a top White House official declining to say whether the president stands by the former general. In a series of appearances, Trump\u2019s top domestic policy adviser Stephen Miller demurred when asked about Flynn amid reports that the national security adviser spoke with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Inauguration Day and urged Moscow to show restraint in its response to sanctions implemented by the Obama administration.",
        "CANNON BALL, N. D. \u2014 The main camp here, once home to thousands of Native Americans and their allies who gathered to protest the completion of the Dakota Access pipeline, is quickly turning into a gooey pit of mud. Unseasonably warm temperatures over the weekend melted giant mounds of snow, and many of the remaining 200 or so pipeline protesters \u2014 \u201cwater protectors\u201d \u2014 are gathering their possessions and making plans to get off the property, which sits in a flood zone near the Missouri River. The rising waters, and a federal eviction notice for Feb.",
        "Rep. Jason Chaffetz is not yielding. When he gavels in his House committee Monday night, the Utah Republican will begin the rare act of dismantling a D. C. law \u2014 one that allows for assisted suicide \u2014 despite the wrath of District residents who are planning a massive \u201cHands off D. C. \u201d rally and accuse him of bullying the city to pander to his conservative base.",
        "Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) on Sunday called President Trump a \u201cpathological liar,\u201d while Sen. Al Franken ( .) reiterated that \u201ca few\u201d Republican senators are concerned about the president\u2019s mental health. The strong words from two senators came as Democrats attacked Trump\u2019s travel ban and said that members of his administration should be investigated or have security clearances suspended for recent comments or conversations with Russian officials.",
        "Sen. Charles E. Grassley ( ) has raised eyebrows before with his tweeting habits (remember the dead deer?) but messages posted this weekend on more serious subjects captured our attention. Iowa\u2019s senior senator kicked things off Saturday afternoon by trying to draw President Trump\u2019s attention to the issues of government transparency and democracy in Russia.",
        "A Missouri man who identified himself as the leader of a Ku Klux Klan chapter has been found dead several days after he was reported missing, officials said. The body of Frank Ancona of Leadwood, Mo. was discovered late Saturday on a river bank in a rural part of the state, Washington County Sheriff Zach Jacobsen said in a statement posted to Facebook.

Forest Service employee found his car on national forest land, Jacobsen said.",
        "Alec Baldwin hosted \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d this week, but the resident President Trump impersonator was nowhere to be seen during the show\u2019s cold open. Instead, Melissa McCarthy reprised her unhinged, seething Sean Spicer character, which was last week\u2019s SNL moment \u2014 and an impersonation that reportedly unsettled the White House. Trump had been most troubled by the fact that a woman portrayed his male White House press secretary, a sendup viewed by some as detrimental to Spicer\u2019s longevity in the job, Politico reported. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t like his people to look weak,\u201d a top Trump donor told the outlet.",
        "Dilbireen Muhsin, a Iraqi Yazidi boy whose family fled a genocide perpetrated by the Islamic State a few years ago, has been without his parents for more than three months. The toddler has been living in Michigan with a woman who had agreed to take care of him while his parents were in Iraq, unable to come to the United States. Sometimes, Dilbireen thinks Adlay Kejjan, his caretaker, is his mother. He used to cry at night, Kejjan said.",
        "NANTICOKE, Pa. \u2014 Sarah Scintilla turned 18 last summer, quickly registered as a Republican and, in November, enthusiastically voted for Donald Trump. Her news came from what friends shared on Facebook and from CNN (\u201cmy \u201d). The motivation behind her vote? Negative changes in her home town, nearby Hazleton. \u201cIt used to be a great place, but now it\u2019s a lot of immigrants and crime,\u201d the nursing student at Luzerne County Community College said. \u201cThey had to put metal detectors in at the high school. It\u2019s so much worse now. \u201d Trump\u2019s vow to bring back better times resonated.",
        "The list of companies dropping products that carry the Trump name grew this weekend, with two major U. S. retailers announcing that they\u2019re no longer selling Trump Home items online. Reuters reported Saturday that Sears Holdings and subsidiary Kmart will discontinue online sales of 31 items from the Trump Home collection, which includes lines of living room and bedroom furniture, lamps and chandeliers. Brian Hanover, a spokesman for Sears Holdings, said the decision was made \u201camid a streamlining effort,\u201d Reuters reported.",
        "Al Jarreau, a Grammy singer whose versatile tenor voice and vibrant stage style blurred the lines between jazz, soul and pop music, died Feb. 12 at a Los Angeles hospital. He was 76. His publicist, Joe Gordon, announced the death, saying the singer had been treated for exhaustion, after announcing his retirement from touring last week. The cause of death was not immediately known. Mr. Jarreau was loosely classified as a jazz singer, but his eclectic style was entirely his own, polished through years of obscure apprenticeship in lonely nightclubs.",
        "Dozens of passengers fled a plane and police removed their United Airlines pilot after she gave a long, bizarre speech before takeoff on Saturday. The pilot boarded the afternoon flight at International Airport a bit late \u2014 wearing a ball cap and casual clothes. Straight away, she appeared to get into an argument with crew members at the front of the plane. From his seat near the back, Chris Moore figured at first that she was just another San flier. \u201cI thought she was a passenger, complaining,\u201d he told The Washington Post. \u201cThen she grabs the mic.",
        "White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Monday would not confirm that President Trump has confidence in his national security adviser Michael Flynn, and said that the president is still \u201cevaluating the situation. \u201d In a statement, Spicer contradicted the comments made by another senior aide, Kellyanne Conway, who just hours earlier had said that the president remained confident in Flynn. The mixed signals come amid growing concerns about whether Flynn communicated with Russian officials about sanctions before Trump took office and caused Vice President Pence to mislead the public about those conversations.",
        "At least four Republican senators are still on the fence about whether to support Andrew Puzder, President Trump\u2019s choice for labor secretary, putting more pressure on the restaurant executive and political novice to win over members of the president\u2019s own party to win confirmation. The four Republicans are all members of the Senate\u2019s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, where Puzder is set to appear Thursday to answer questions. The high level of public concern is notable, given that Republicans have for the most part supported Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks even before their confirmation hearings. Among the skeptics is Sen.",
        "Three federal appeals court judges on the West Coast dealt President Trump a critical blow last week when they refused to reinstate his controversial executive order barring refugees and citizens of seven nations from entering the country. Their ruling means that \u2014 at least for the foreseeable future \u2014 people can travel as they could before the ban existed. How long that will last, though, remains an open question \u2014 largely dependent on what the administration decides to do in and out of court. Here are the four options it is considering.",
        "Richard DeAgazio was already seated for dinner, on the Club\u2019s terrace, when President Trump entered with the prime minister of Japan on Saturday night. The crowd \u2014 mostly paying members of Trump\u2019s private oceanfront club in Palm Beach, Fla. \u2014 stood to applaud. The president\u2019s party sat about six tables away. Then, DeAgazio \u2014 a retired investor who joined three months ago \u2014 got a text from a friend. North Korea had just a ballistic missile, which it claimed could carry a nuclear warhead. DeAgazio looked over at the president\u2019s table.",
        "Close observers of the 2016 election will remember that, on occasion, President Trump liked to draw attention to his opponent\u2019s security practices as a way of criticism. There was, you may recall, something about an email server. \u201cHillary Clinton \u2026 sent classified information, even during her travels overseas, jeopardizing the national security of the American people by allowing her emails to be hacked by foreign intelligence services,\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign website declared.",
        "It\u2019s unlikely that an Army officer posing for a photograph with a patron at President Trump\u2019s golf resort while apparently carrying the \u201cnuclear football\u201d broke any Defense Department regulations, Defense officials said, but doing so has put the Pentagon in an awkward situation. The image was one of several posted over the weekend by Richard DeAgazio, a retired investor, as the president took phone calls publicly over dinner with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe after North Korea conducted a ballistic missile test Saturday night.",
        "Angry Utahans shouted down Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, at the Republican\u2019s recent town hall meeting. \u201cDo your job!\u201d they chanted, scolding him for refusing to investigate the Trump administration. In fairness to Chaffetz, he is busy with more pressing matters. True, Chaffetz, after his unending probes of the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton, hasn\u2019t shown any appetite to examine, say, the Trump administration\u2019s ties to Russia or its many conflicts of interest. But the chairman has shown determination to probe, without fear or favor, the threat to America posed by Sid the Science Kid."
