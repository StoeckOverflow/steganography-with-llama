        "Everybody is having fun with CNN\u2019s amazing report detailing Donald Trump\u2019s trip to with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe.",
        "Brian Klaas is a Fellow in Comparative Politics at the London School of Economics and author of The Despot\u2019s Accomplice: How the West is Aiding & Abetting the Decline of Democracy. There is an enormous paradox at the heart of American democracy. Congress is deeply and stubbornly unpopular. On average, between 10 and 15 percent of Americans approve of Congress \u2014 on a par with public support for traffic jams and cockroaches. And yet, in the 2016 election, only eight incumbents \u2014 eight out of a body of 435 representatives \u2014 were defeated at the polls.",
        "Danielle Allen is a political theorist at Harvard University and a contributing columnist for The Post. Strangely, I feel the stirrings of optimism. For the past few weeks, I\u2019ve been walking around with a bizarre phrase in my head. \u201cWe need a Cleisthenic moment. \u201d This is the occupational hazard of being a scholar of ancient history. You\u2019ve got names buzzing between your ears that mean nothing to almost anyone else. Cleisthenes was a politician in ancient Greece.",
        "When Donald Trump ran for the White House, he insisted that his lack of experience in politics and his complete disdain for the details (or even the broad strokes) of policy were not only not a problem, they were a key reason why he\u2019d be such a terrific president. The system needed to be shaken up, and it couldn\u2019t be done by someone locked inside it. This is inane.",
        "A federal appeals panel\u2019s decision to uphold the stay of Donald Trump\u2019s temporary travel ban has dramatically raised the stakes in the coming Supreme Court fight \u2014 and increased the likelihood that Republicans may have to use the nuclear option to get Neil Gorsuch through the Senate. The left has been in a froth since Trump took office, and members of the Democratic establishment in Washington are terrified that the rising movement will turn on them in the same way the tea party turned on the Republican establishment. The Post reported that when Senate Minority Leader Charles E.",
        "About 188, 000 residents near Oroville, Calif. were ordered to evacuate Sunday after a hole in an emergency spillway in the Oroville Dam threatened to flood the surrounding area. Thousands clogged highways leading out of the area headed south, north and west, and arteries major and minor remained jammed as midnight approached on the West Coast \u2014 though by early Monday, Lake Oroville\u2019s water level had dropped to a point at which water was no longer spilling over, and the crisis appeared to be stabilizing. The level in the massive lake reached its peak of 902.",
        "A District of Columbia federal judge on Monday turned down a request to temporarily block construction on the Dakota Access pipeline, saying there would not be any risk of immediate harm until oil starts flowing. But U. S. District Judge James E. Boasberg, while denying a request by two Native American Lakota tribes for a temporary restraining order, ordered the pipeline company to provide weekly updates about when it expected oil to begin flowing, leaving open the possibility of further court intervention. He set a date of Feb.",
        "Even if you\u2019re not much of a fashionista, it\u2019s been hard to miss the firestorm that has recently engulfed the Ivanka Trump brand. And foreboding signs are continuing to pile up: Panjiva, a global trade data company, says that imports of products that bear the Ivanka Trump name were 54. 4 percent lower in the three months ended Jan. 31 compared with the three months that ended Sept. 30. And on social media, the boycott campaign called Grab Your Wallet is gaining momentum.",
        "Want to get a peek inside the Trump White House? Keep checking Twitter and Instagram, because the more traditional method \u2014 a formal White House tour \u2014 isn\u2019t an option. The White House Visitors Office typically halts tours during presidential transitions, as the new president brings in staff to run the operation, but the lull under the new administration is unusually long. That\u2019s not lost on members of Congress, who handle constituent requests for tours. On Sunday, Sen. Charles E.",
        "It was less than a year ago that Michelle Obama referred to it as \u201cher baby. \u201d She wasn\u2019t talking about her youngest daughter, Sasha, or the Obama\u2019s pet dog Bo, but something undoubtedly dear to her during her time at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue: the White House vegetable garden. Her comments were made during her eighth and final spring planting, but \u201chopefully,\u201d she added, \u201cthis will not be the last\u201d one ever. First lady Melania Trump confirmed that although the garden\u2019s founder may have vacated the premises, her beloved garden lives on.",
        "Each year on Grammy night, the Recording Academy plunges itself a few leagues deeper into a dim trench of irrelevance, making it difficult to get too over its chronic fumbles. But this year was different. When industry voters chose Adele\u2019s conventional bestseller, \u201c25,\u201d over Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s provocative \u201cLemonade\u201d for album of the year at Sunday\u2019s 59th Grammy Awards, the ritual nonsense had finally curdled into something unacceptable. Here\u2019s why. For the past five years, black artists have been making pop music, some of which has been nominated for the heaviest Grammy in the land, album of the year.",
        "One in a series on the styles that really popped at New York Fashion Week. NEW YORK \u2014 There was a lot to like on the runway at the Altuzarra show Sunday night. Indeed, there was an awful lot on the runway. The centerpiece of his set was a series of grassy knolls constructed inside a commercial space with windows. Designer Joseph Altuzarra quoted Lady Macbeth in his show notes: Look like th\u2019 innocent flower, But be the serpent under \u2018t. And off we went. Altuzarra 2017 collection.

        "Kirkuk is a city of Northern Iraq in the Kurdish region of the country. Arabs, Kurds, Turkmen, Christians and foreign workers live beside one another. Back in the day, Saddam Hussein initiated several campaigns to Arabize Kirkuk, evicting Kurdish families and giving their homes over to families from south of Iraq. But when the U. S. invasion of 2003 reached the city, Kurdish forces worked to reverse this process. The city fell within the disputed areas; responsibility for administration and security was shared between Baghdad and the Kurdish authorities.",
        "Vice President Pence first learned that former national security adviser Michael Flynn had misled him about the nature of his contact with a Russian official on Feb. 9, a full two weeks after other White House officials were briefed on the matter, an aide to Pence said on Tuesday.",
        "President Trump on Tuesday blamed \u201cillegal leaks\u201d for the downfall of national security adviser Michael Flynn, who resigned late Monday amid reports of potentially illegal interactions with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump was sworn in as president. In a tweet, Trump expressed frustration with what he views as a culture of leaks in the nation\u2019s capital. \u201cThe real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington?\u201d he wrote. \u201cWill these leaks be happening as I deal on N.",
        "Top Republican and Democratic senators pledged Tuesday to deepen their investigation of Russian involvement in the 2016 election in the wake of Michael T. Flynn\u2019s resignation as President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, opening a new and potentially uncomfortable chapter in the uneasy relationship between Trump and Capitol Hill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said such an investigation is \u201chighly likely,\u201d and the top two members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Richard Burr ( . C.) and Sen. Mark R.",
        "The presidential campaign was a heady experience for Donald Trump: months of triumph and, better yet, disproving all the experts who said he never had a chance of winning. The early weeks of the new administration have been the opposite: the public humbling of a new president. Trump\u2019s campaign was never entirely smooth, but instincts that served him so well then appear to be less helpful now that he is in office.",
        "With President Trump in his fourth full week in office, the upheaval inside the administration that West Wing officials had optimistically dismissed as growing pains is now embedding itself as standard operating procedure. Trump \u2014 distracted by political brushfires, often of his own making \u2014 has failed to fill such key posts as White House communications director, while positions across agencies and scores of ambassadorships around the globe still sit empty. Upset about damaging leaks of his calls with world leaders and other national security information, Trump has ordered an internal investigation to find the leakers.",
        "Strange, isn\u2019t it, that it was a lie that supposedly caused Michael Flynn to be fired? His false assurances to Vice President Pence about conversations with Russia were what evidently did him in as national security adviser. If lies were always taken that seriously in the Trump administration, we might be living on the right side of the looking glass. But they aren\u2019t. And we aren\u2019t. Consider, for example, the way the consistently President Trump applauded a top adviser last weekend after he went on national talk shows and told brash falsehoods.",
        "Republican Rep. Peter Roskam of Illinois has a safe seat in Congress. So what\u2019s he running from? First, supporters of the Affordable Care Act showed up at his office for a previously scheduled meeting with his staff. But the 16 of them were turned away when Roskam staffers discovered they were accompanied by a reporter, the Chicago Tribune reported. Next, Roskam went to the Palatine Township Republican Organization\u2019s monthly meeting, billed as open to all. But organizers shut out the general public because of intense interest. With hundreds of protesters massed outside, Roskam left through a back door.",
        "Here we are, stuck in a cycle of breathless indignation about fake news, alternative facts lies. Well, there certainly is some of that going on, but for the purposes of context, it\u2019s worth remembering how all this got started. Particularly, let\u2019s remember that the onslaught of \u201cfake news\u201d started with the Democrats and the mainstream media. Without reliving every gory detail, let\u2019s refresh modern political history so we can gain some appreciation of where we are today. The real deceit in the modern era started with President Bill Clinton and his White House.",
        "In December 2015, I received a giant Christmas card from Donald Trump; or, more correctly, from the Trump campaign. \u201cMerry Christmas & Happy Holidays,\u201d it said. \u201cWe are, together, going to Make America Great Again. \u201d The card\u2019s caught my attention: \u201cI Love You All, Donald J. Trump. \u201d That word \u201clove\u201d doesn\u2019t get much use in politics. You hear lots about compassion and faith and hope \u2014 but not love. There\u2019s something about it that reveals too much, or makes its user vulnerable.",
        "I flew into Boston in a snowstorm Sunday, coming in low over little white houses in the gray murk, and my connecting flight to Vermont was canceled, so I rented a car and set out into the storm. I had told Vermont I\u2019d be there, and once you start canceling things, where do you stop?",
        "Sherrilyn Ifill is president and of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller argued Sunday that President Trump was the victim of voter fraud in the election. \u201cVoter fraud,\u201d Miller insisted, \u201cis a serious problem in this country. \u201d This statement is untrue. He also said that \u201cthe White House has provided enormous evidence\u201d of this fraud. This is also untrue. The president himself has repeatedly made unsubstantiated claims, from last week\u2019s allegation that .",
        "A lot of distinctly unsavory characters have made it into the upper echelons of Venezuelan politics over the past decade or so. To understand why, you need only consider the uniquely murky opportunities presented by the country\u2019s current state of chaos: the wholesale looting of oil revenues; the deep, almost carnal relationship with the dictatorship in Havana; the ties with Colombian guerrillas, and the more recent links to drug cartels; and an unlikely alliance with Tehran. You\u2019d probably think that no single regime figure could possibly be linked to all of these phenomena. But you\u2019d be wrong.",
        "COLORADO SPRINGS \u2014 The documents describing a coach\u2019s sexual abuse of three aspiring Olympic athletes circulated through U. S. Olympic Committee headquarters in early 2014. It started in a hotel room in 2010, Yasmin Brown wrote. She was 16 and her taekwondo coach \u2014 Marc Gitelman, or \u201cMaster G\u201d \u2014 was 44. Gitelman provided alcohol and suggested a game. A few minutes later, Brown collapsed on the bed. She felt his hand lift her shorts, then his lips on her thigh.",
        "The director of the Office of Government Ethics said there is \u201cstrong reason to believe\u201d that senior adviser Kellyanne Conway violated federal rules by endorsing Ivanka Trump\u2019s clothing line, urging the White House to investigate the matter and consider disciplining her. In a Feb. 13 letter to White House Deputy Counsel Stefan Passantino, OGE Director Walter M. Shaub Jr. wrote that Conway\u2019s comments appeared to be \u201ca clear violation\u201d of federal ethics rules that bar federal employees from using their public office to endorse a product. \u201cUnder the present circumstances, there is strong reason to believe that Ms.",
        "OROVILLE, Calif. \u2014 Two days before the entire population of Oroville, Calif. was evacuated, Jennifer Tatman knew something was wrong. Looking up at the towering Oroville Dam, she noticed something quite unusual: A cascade of water was pouring over the dam\u2019s emergency spillway and into the Feather River. She walked to the fire station by her house to ask whether they expected the town to flood, and they told her not to worry. An emergency contact number she received rang busy all weekend.",
        "TOKYO \u201d The target: the estranged half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The setting: an airport in Malaysia. And the possible suspect: a woman carrying a cloth treated with lethal liquid. It adds up to a case that seems ripped straight from the pages of a spy novel. Even by the standards of sensational news from North Korea, the details that emerged Tuesday were astounding.",
        "The director of the Secret Service, who was given the assignment of shoring up that agency in a period of crisis, is leaving one of Washington\u2019s toughest jobs after a little more than two years. In late 2014, President Barack Obama summoned Joseph P. Clancy, his former detail leader, back from the private sector amid a string of security breaches and employee misconduct in the agency. On Tuesday, Clancy said it\u2019s time to retire for good. He leaves March 4, giving President Trump the chance to select a new director."
