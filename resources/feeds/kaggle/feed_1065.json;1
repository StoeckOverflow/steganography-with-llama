        "A bill advancing in Oklahoma would require a woman to get the written consent of the fetus\u2019s father before obtaining an abortion. The bill, which passed out of a House committee Tuesday, would also require a woman \u201cto provide, in writing, the identity of the father of the fetus to the physician who is to perform or induce the abortion,\u201d according to the bill\u2019s language. \u201cIf the person identified as the father of the fetus challenges the fact that he is the father, such individual may demand that a paternity test be performed. \u201d The bill\u2019s author, Rep.",
        "There\u2019s a case building that television \u2014 more than wealth or family or real estate, certainly more than politics \u2014 is what President Trump loves most. The evidence was there all along. A camera in the room is the only thing that seems to truly animate him, for it brings with it the promise of big (or easily inflatable) ratings. A television show is the only thing that ever offered Trump, briefly, a unanimous and undisputed success.",
        "First there was the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban, then talk about the Mexican border wall and, finally, last week, Alfredo Solis decided it was time to send a message. So the owner of Mezcalero, the hottest new Mexican restaurant in the District, put it at the bottom of his receipts: \u201cImmigrants help make America great!\u201d \u201cI came to this country 17 years ago, and I work hard. I want to help make America great,\u201d said Solis. \u201cAmerica is great already.",
        "One in a series on the most impressive looks at New York Fashion Week. NEW YORK \u2014 This is simply, blessedly fashion. It is not incomprehensible experimental craft; it is not cultural messaging. It isn\u2019t a protest. And while there may be many, many reasons to march and boycott right now, they are going to have to pace themselves; otherwise, they will keel over from emotional exhaustion. So, perhaps, in addition to creating terrific fashion, the designers of Proenza Schouler also offered a bit of a respite.",
        "Andrew Puzder, President Trump\u2019s labor secretary nominee, withdrew from consideration Wednesday amid growing resistance from Senate Republicans centered primarily on Puzder\u2019s past employment of an undocumented housekeeper. The collapse of Puzder\u2019s nomination threw the White House into further turmoil just two days after the resignation of Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, amid revelations that Flynn had spoken repeatedly, and possibly illegally, with the Russian ambassador last year about lifting U. S. sanctions.",
        "President Trump criticized the intelligence community and the media Wednesday for the news reports that ultimately led to national security adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s resignation Monday night, less than four weeks into his White House tenure. \u201cI think he\u2019s been treated very, very unfairly by the media \u2014 as I call it, the \u2018fake media,\u2019 in many cases \u2014 and I think it\u2019s really a sad thing that he was treated so badly,\u201d Trump said at a news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
        "Michael Flynn\u2019s resignation as national security adviser is shifting the balance of power between President Trump and Congress, with Republican senators vowing to more aggressively exercise oversight of the new administration and Democrats seizing an opportunity to ask pointed questions about Trump\u2019s ties to Russia. On Wednesday, Senate Democrats convened an emergency meeting to plan their next steps in probing the circumstances that led to Flynn\u2019s departure.",
        "There\u2019s very little good news for President Trump these days. His White House is dealing with not one but two (!) explosive reports that his aides and associates were in contact with Russian intelligence officials during the campaign. But there is one bright spot for Trump: Both of the stories use zero sources to back up their claims.",
        "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 Terminal 2 at Kuala Lumpur International Airport was convulsing with its usual Monday morning chaos. Passengers were crowding around kiosks for flights to Bali and Cebu and Da Nang, cramming belongings into their . One of those navigating the cavernous white terminal was a rotund Asian man traveling alone, checking in for a flight to Macau after a week in Malaysia.",
        "President Trump backed away on Wednesday from U. S. support for the idea of a sovereign Palestinian state alongside Israel, potentially signaling the death of a fundamental strategy of past Middle East peace negotiations, even as Trump said he wants to try his hand at a new deal. Trump appeared to open the negotiations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during their news conference at the White House, directly calling for Israel to curtail Jewish in the West Bank.",
        "The final question of Wednesday\u2019s joint news conference between the leaders of the United States and Israel was directed at President Trump and focused on . Here\u2019s the question, and Trump\u2019s answer, courtesy of the New York Times\u2019s Sopan Deb: This whole answer from Trump, being asked about in the U. S. Read the whole thing: pic. twitter. \u2014 Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) February 15, 2017 The question was centered on the rise in attacks since Trump won in November and what he would say to allegations that his administration \u201cis playing with xenophobia and maybe racist tones.",
        "MSNBC\u2019s Mika Brzezinski said Wednesday that she refuses to book Kellyanne Conway on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d \u2014 and that wasn\u2019t even the harshest thing Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough said about the counselor to the president. \u201cWe know for a fact she tries to book herself on this show,\u201d Brzezinski said. \u201cI won\u2019t do it, \u2019cuz I don\u2019t believe in fake news or information that is not true. And that is \u2014 every time I\u2019ve ever seen her on television, something\u2019s askew, off or incorrect. \u201d The declaration that Conway is not welcome on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d is not very surprising.",
        "President Trump has just set the speed record for scandal \u2014 from zero to Watergate in 25 days. Not yet four weeks into the new administration, Washington has already revived a favorite parlor game based on Howard Baker\u2019s famous question in the Nixon era. \u201cWhat did President Trump know, and when did he know it?\u201d asked conservative Max Boot. \u201cWhat did President Trump know and when did he know it?\u201d asked liberal Joan Walsh. The Boston Globe, the Daily Mail, the Chicago Tribune and others asked variations of the same.",
        "In theory, if only occasionally in fact, Congress plays a role when a president wants to initiate military hostilities. Sen. Mike Lee ( ) thinks Congress should also have a say when a president wants to initiate a trade war. Lee is a constitutional, meaning an actual, conservative who is eager for Congress to retrieve some of the power it has improvidently, and sometimes unconstitutionally, delegated to presidents. As a step toward correcting Congress\u2019s he proposes the Global Trade Accountability Act.",
        "Let\u2019s not mumble or whisper about the central issue facing our country: What is this democratic nation to do when the man serving as president of the United States plainly has no business being president of the United States? The Michael Flynn fiasco was the entirely predictable product of the indiscipline, deceit, incompetence and moral indifference that characterize Donald Trump\u2019s approach to leadership. Even worse, Trump\u2019s loyalties are now in doubt.",
        "Congress created the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, or food stamps, \u201cto alleviate . . . hunger and malnutrition\u201d and to \u201cpermit households to obtain a more nutritious diet through normal channels of trade,\u201d in the words of the federal statute establishing the program. It\u2019s a good goal. Whether SNAP is optimally designed to achieve it is a separate question, to which the answer seems to be \u201cno,\u201d according to new research commissioned by the Agriculture Department.",
        "Rob Stein, a former senior strategist for the Democratic National Committee, is the founder and board member emeritus of the progressive advocacy organization Democracy Alliance. Resistance is the appropriate and necessary impulse of Democrats at this strange and raucous inception of the Trump administration. It is also woefully insufficient to address the monumental existential threats Democrats confront. Resistance alone will not defeat the Republicans\u2019 stranglehold on political power in 30 states, will not affect redistricting in 2020, will not defeat Republican congressional majorities and will not advance an affirmative progressive agenda.",
        "THE NEWS that members of President Trump\u2019s circle had repeated contacts with Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election, reported by the New York Times on Tuesday, might have been less concerning if the president had responded by explaining or condemning the contacts and accepting the need for an impartial investigation. Instead, on Wednesday morning, he dashed off a tweets in which he curiously both denied the news and attacked the leakers who disclosed it.",
        "A policy manifesto from an influential conservative group with ties to the Trump administration, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, urges the dismantling of the Education Department and bringing God into American classrooms. The document produced by the Council for National Policy calls for a \u201crestoration of education in America\u201d that would minimize the federal role, promote religious schools and home schooling and enshrine \u201chistoric principles\u201d as a basis for instruction.

        "Luck may play a role in determining who ends up taking prescription opioids according to a study released Wednesday that found a link between the prescribing habits of hospital doctors and extended use of narcotic painkillers.

H. Chan School of Public Health.",
        "CARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Venezuela suspended CNN in Spanish on Wednesday, shutting off the news channel after officials angrily criticized a report by the network alleging government workers sold passports to members of a Middle East terror group. The National Telecommunications Commission announced it initiated the \u201cadministrative sanction\u201d because of news stories that it considered \u201cdirect aggressions\u201d against Venezuela.

        "A Colorado newspaper is threatening to file a libel suit against a state lawmaker who accused the publication of printing \u201cfake news,\u201d setting the stage for a possible legal battle that could test the definition of the most overused phrase in politics. The episode began last week, when Colorado State Sen. Ray Scott, a Republican, claimed in a tweet that the Daily Sentinel of Grand Junction had published \u201ca fake news story\u201d about a bill that would change the state\u2019s public records law.

        "NEW YORK \u2014 buttons and baseball caps symbolize fashion\u2019s political awakening. So does velvet, billowing satin and bedazzled bodices. Fashion\u2019s message of power unfolds as poetry. Pure outrage has given way to resistance. The designer Mara Hoffman was one of dozens of fashion industry folks at the Women\u2019s March in Washington and she helped raise funds for the rally. She was hardly a newbie protester, but she returned to Seventh Avenue inspired and energized. \u201cThe turnout was unbelievable to me.",
        "Former national security adviser Michael Flynn denied to FBI agents in an interview last month that he had discussed U. S. sanctions against Russia with that country\u2019s ambassador to the United States before President Trump took office, contradicting the contents of intercepted communications collected by intelligence agencies, current and former U. S. officials said. The Jan. 24 interview potentially puts Flynn in legal jeopardy. Lying to the FBI is a felony offense. But several officials said it is unclear whether prosecutors would attempt to bring a case, in part because Flynn may parse the definition of the word \u201csanctions.",
        "On Friday, President Trump and his entourage will jet for the third straight weekend to a working getaway at his oceanfront Club in Palm Beach, Fla. On Saturday, Trump\u2019s sons Eric and Don Jr. with their Secret Service details in tow, will be nearly 8, 000 miles away in the United Arab Emirates, attending the grand opening of a golf resort in the \u201cBeverly Hills of Dubai. \u201d Meanwhile, New York police will keep watch outside Trump Tower in Manhattan, the chosen home of first lady Melania Trump and son Barron.
