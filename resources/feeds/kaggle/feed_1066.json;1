        "President Trump on Thursday aired his grievances against the news media, the intelligence community and his detractors generally in a sprawling, news conference that alternated between claims that he had \u201cinherited a mess\u201d and the assertion that his fledgling administration \u201cis running like a machine. \u201d \u201cTo be honest, I inherited a mess,\u201d Trump said, in a news conference that lasted more than an hour and was at times rambling, combative and pointed. \u201cIt\u2019s a mess. At home and abroad, a mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country.",
        "Over the course of the lengthy and bizarre news conference that President Trump held Thursday, few moments crystallized the unusual nature of his presidency as effectively as an exchange he had at the end with April Ryan of American Urban Radio Networks. Ryan asked Trump if he would include the CBC in discussions about his agenda for addressing urban policy. The CBC, for those unaware, is the Congressional Black Caucus, a group of African American legislators that is often a leading voice on the Hill for issues dealing with the black community.",
        "A solemn President Trump turned his Thursday afternoon announcement of a new labor secretary nominee into a screed against the media and defense of his first four weeks as president. It was remarkable. Trump hit all the usual points: the polls, the electoral college, the media, etc. He even said that he inherited a \u201cmess\u201d four separate times. There were grievances galore. Below is the transcript, which we\u2019ll update as it comes in, along with our analysis and annotations. TRUMP: Thank you very much.",
        "Donald Trump entered the East Room on Thursday reeling from a week filled with resignations, withdrawals and continued questions surrounding his campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia. What followed was an attack on Trump\u2019s favorite foil: the media. \u201cMany of our nation\u2019s reporters will not tell you the truth,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe press honestly is out of control,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe level of dishonesty is out of control,\u201d Trump said. And that was before he even took a single question!",
        "John Podesta, the chair of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, served as counselor to President Barack Obama and chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. President Trump\u2019s pivot isn\u2019t subtle. First he benefited from fake news stories during the campaign; then as and now president, he has constantly used the epithet against mainstream media outlets that dare criticize him. Any negative polls, he has proclaimed, are \u201cfake news.",
        "Hugh Hewitt, a Post contributing columnist, hosts a nationally syndicated radio show and is author of \u201cThe Fourth Way: The Conservative Playbook for a Lasting GOP Majority. \u201d Bert Lance, President Jimmy Carter\u2019s first director of the Office of Management and Budget, managed fewer than nine months in that post before resigning. Mack McLarty President Bill Clinton\u2019s first White House chief of staff, was twice as successful as Lance, if success is measured by tenure. McLarty lasted 14 months in the seat Reince Priebus occupies today. President Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, didn\u2019t make it a month.",
        "The United States\u2019 supposed lurch toward authoritarianism \u2014 or maybe fascism \u2014 has become an obsession among progressives and even a few centrists and conservatives. George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d and Sinclair Lewis\u2019s \u201cIt Can\u2019t Happen Here\u201d are once again bestsellers; liberal intellectuals, discoursing on the term\u2019s definition, have categorically called President Trump a fascist; and websites murmur warnings of another Reichstag fire.",
        "News, I am sad to report, continues to occur. And it is even worse than I thought. If President Trump\u2019s press appearances Wednesday and Thursday were any indication, we are still trapped inside the 2016 election and will stay trapped there forever. It is the Groundhog Day edition of Hell. We will stay trapped in here until Trump learns his lesson, or we learn not to be so free with Hitler comparisons, or something. Which is to say, we will be trapped here forever.",
        "Jim Hoagland is a contributing editor for The Post. The most disturbing habit that President Trump and his aides have shown in their disastrous break from the gate is the pure recklessness of their behavior and words. When their bluffs are called, they have left themselves no room to maneuver or correct course without having to abandon their original heading. Michael Flynn s brief career as Trump s national security adviser lies in ruins after he discussed U. S.",
        "In President Trump\u2019s rambling, combative and at times incoherent news conference, he declared his administration is \u201ca machine,\u201d something few people not employed in the White House believe. He argues \u201cRussia is fake news\u201d \u2014 yet fired national security adviser Michael Flynn over information revealed by the media.",
        "A hearing in El Paso County in Texas went from ordinary to \u201cunprecedented\u201d last week when half a dozen Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents showed up at a courthouse where an undocumented woman was seeking a protective order against the boyfriend she accused of abusing her. The woman, a citizen of Mexico who was living in El Paso had been driven to the courthouse by a victim\u2019s advocate from the Center Against Sexual and Family Violence, a shelter for victims of domestic abuse where she had been living. She left under arrest.",

        "Months after the Pentagon said it wouldn\u2019t use a controversial type of ammunition that has been blamed for health complications, U. S. aircraft fired thousands of the rounds during two air raids in Syria in November 2015, the Pentagon acknowledged Wednesday. The use of the ammunition, a 30mm bullet called was first reported by a joint Air Policy investigation on Tuesday. The roughly 5, 265 rounds of the munition were fired from multiple ground attack aircraft on Nov 16, 2015, and Nov.",
        "BRUSSELS \u2014 Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Thursday that Russia will need to \u201cprove itself first\u201d before the United States and other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are willing to let their armed forces collaborate, potentially complicating efforts by President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to cooperate in the fight against the Islamic State in Syria. Mattis, speaking at NATO\u2019s headquarters in Brussels, told reporters that the conditions are not right presently for U. S. and Russia forces to work together.",
        "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 At least 73 people were reported killed and up to several hundred injured Thursday when a suicide bomber struck inside a famous Sufi shrine in Pakistan while devotees were gathered for a weekly ritual of music and dance, police and medical officials said. The Islamic State militant group, based in the Middle East with allied outfits in Pakistan and Afghanistan, asserted responsibility for the blast through an affiliated news site. The Islamic State and similar extremist Sunni groups view Sufism, a mystical strain of Islam, as heretical.",

        "If you believed the Trouble Brewing beers sold at Walmart are truly craft beers, instead of beers produced at a large industrial brewery in Rochester, N. Y. you\u2019re not alone. But one Cincinnati beer drinker is so mad that he\u2019s suing the world\u2019s largest company over what he\u2019s calling the \u201cwholesale fiction\u201d around the ales, seeking compensatory damages \u201cin an amount to be determined at trial.",
        "The majority of Americans have no clear idea what \u201csell by\u201d labels are trying to tell them. But after 40 years of letting us guess, the grocery industry has made moves to clear up the confusion. On Wednesday, the Food Marketing Institute and the Grocery Manufacturers Association, the two largest trade groups for the grocery industry, announced that they\u2019ve adopted standardized, voluntary regulations to clear up what product date labels mean.",
        "One in a series on the looks that had people talking at New York Fashion Week. NEW YORK \u2014 There\u2019s not a lot to say about trends or the politics of the moment when talking about the Thom Browne fall 2017 collection for women. Yes, the Wednesday evening show was filled with expert tailoring, which has been on a lot of runways. And there were references to sport \u2014 from the shoes perched atop skating blades to the trousers that looked like the snow pants of your youth.",
        "Forty years ago, Fashion Week in New York was focused on the clothes. Not celebrities. Not stars. Not social media. Guests gathered in the often dingy showrooms around Seventh Avenue, and photographers took their places along the runway. And the models walked. They sold the clothes with a knowing nod or jaunty strut. The audience was filled with retailers, magazine editors and newspaper journalists from all around the country.",
        "The Trump administration\u2019s attempts to translate the president\u2019s campaign rhetoric on immigration into reality have run into two major roadblocks: the complexity of reshaping a sprawling immigration system and a president who has not been clear about how he wants to change it. In his first four weeks in office, President Trump has sought to use his executive powers to punch through Washington\u2019s legislative and bureaucratic hurdles and make quick progress on pledges to crack down on illegal immigrants and tighten border control.",
        "MUNICH \u2014 Germany\u2019s defense chief on Friday hit President Trump\u2019s dismissive attitude toward Washington\u2019s European allies, giving a frosty reception to U. S. envoys at the largest conclave of U. S. and European officials since the inauguration. Speaking to a packed hall that included Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly, German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen hammered Trump\u2019s attitudes toward Russia without ever mentioning the U. S. leader by name.",
        "WEST PALM BEACH. Fla. \u2014 President Trump further escalated his attacks on the news media Friday afternoon when he tweeted that outlets such as the New York Times, NBC, ABC, CBS and CNN are not his enemy but \u201cthe enemy of the American People. \u201d Although Trump has long colorfully criticized news coverage and sparred with reporters who question him, he had not yet labeled the fourth estate as being an enemy of the country.",
        "Scott Pruitt woke up Friday morning as Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general, a post he had used for six years to repeatedly sue the Environmental Protection Agency for its efforts to regulate mercury, smog and other forms of pollution. By day\u2019s end, he had been sworn in as the agency\u2019s new leader, setting off a struggle over what the EPA will become in the Trump era. Pruitt begins what is likely to be a controversial tenure with a clear set of goals.",
        "The U. S. Marshals Service says it is providing security for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos after a handful of protesters prevented her from entering a D. C. middle school. [Protesters briefly block Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u2019s visit to a D. C. school] The move is unusual for the Education Department, which typically has a team of civil servants guarding the secretary, and for the marshals, law enforcement officers who are generally responsible for protecting federal judges, transporting prisoners, apprehending fugitives and protecting witnesses.",
        "John McCain is increasingly mad as hell about President Trump. And on Friday, he went after Trump \u2014 hard. During a speech at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, the Republican senator from Arizona delivered a pointed and striking takedown of Trump\u2019s worldview and brand of nationalism. McCain didn\u2019t mention Trump\u2019s name once, but he didn\u2019t have to. And even considering the two men\u2019s history and the terrible things Trump has said about McCain, it was a striking display from a senior leader of a party when it comes to a president of the same party.",
        "NORTH CHARLESTON, S. C. \u2014 When President Trump took the stage here Friday to mark the launch of Boeing\u2019s newest aircraft, it was a scene reminiscent of his airplane hangar rallies during the presidential campaign. Except, instead of his \u201cTrump\u201d branded Boeing 757 parked in the background, Boeing\u2019s newest product, the Dreamliner glittered in the sun behind him, and off to the side stood Trump\u2019s new ride, Air Force One.",
        "During last year\u2019s race, President Trump\u2019s campaign paid millions of dollars to a data science firm, Cambridge Analytica, that touted its ability to target voters through psychological profiling. Now, with Trump in office, Cambridge\u2019s British parent company is ramping up its U. S. government business by pursuing contracts that could be driven by the new president\u2019s policy agenda, according to multiple people with knowledge of the firm\u2019s activities who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private interactions.",
        "President Trump\u2019s news conference Thursday set off a new round of about Trump\u2019s temperament and his ongoing war with the media. The question is, did the president engage in that news conference to rightly defend himself and his administration, or because he is overly and obsessed with press coverage, displaying a bigger flaw that will ultimately limit his effectiveness? Was the news conference conducted by a media genius who somehow \u2014 either instinctively or intellectually \u2014 has figured out that making the press the bad guy is one way to avoid addressing specific problems and mistakes?",
        "Editor\u2019s note: On Thursday, President Trump held a news conference in which he \u201caired his grievances against the news media, the intelligence community and his detractors. \u201d On Friday, Anita Dunn, former White House communications director under President Barack Obama, and Alice Stewart, former spokeswoman for Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, exchanged views about the news conference and its effects. The email discussion was moderated by Post Opinions digital editor James Downie and has been edited for style and clarity. Anita Dunn: Happy to kick this off."
