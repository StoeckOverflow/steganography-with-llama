        "President Trump had a lot to say at his news conference yesterday. His performance \u2014 characteristically rich in calculated provocations, bizarre asides and even the occasional bit of genuine news \u2014 generated enough material to keep the press corps occupied for weeks. As is so often the case with Trump, however, the most significant thing may be what he chose not to say. In the nearly 14, 000 words of the transcript, Trump never mentioned the words \u201cfreedom\u201d or \u201cdemocracy. \u201d This is merely the latest installment in a pattern.",
        "I configured Twitter a couple of weeks ago to get text alerts on my phone whenever President Trump tweets. Bad! Now any moment of tranquility can be pierced by his random outbursts. I awake from a restful night to see: \u201cIran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE for firing a ballistic missile. Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the U. S. made with them!\u201d I\u2019m pruning in the back yard on a Sunday afternoon and feel a vibration in my pocket: \u201cJust cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril.",
        "Howard Shelanski was administrator of the federal Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs from 2013 to 2017. Since taking office, President Trump has signed executive orders instructing officials to reconsider regulation of the financial sector and requiring executive departments and agencies to find two rules to repeal for every new one they issue. But translating those promises into action is going to be a lot harder than the president thinks. Here\u2019s the rub: It generally takes a new rule to change or remove a regulation that is already on the books.",
        "John Feinblatt is president of Everytown for Gun Safety. We need to enforce the laws already on the books. The problem isn\u2019t guns \u2014 it\u2019s mental illness. Every time there is a tragedy in our country, we hear these same arguments from politicians who consistently oppose legislation aimed at keeping firearms out of dangerous hands. In December, President Barack Obama finalized a rule that did these very two things \u2014 by enforcing existing laws that keep guns out of the hands of people with severe mental illnesses who are already prohibited from having them.",
        "Kraft Heinz, the maker of Velveeta, and Grey Poupon, on Friday said it had made an offer to buy Unilever for $143 billion in what could be the largest food and beverage deal of all time. Unilever, however, said it isn\u2019t interested in the $ deal, which represented an 18 percent premium on Thursday\u2019s share price. The company, which has 400 brands including Hellman\u2019s, Ben & Jerry\u2019s and Vaseline, said it \u201crejected the proposal as it sees no merit, either financial or strategic, for Unilever\u2019s shareholders.",
        "BEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s Foreign Ministry has been at its stonewalling, noncommittal best this week after news of the dramatic assassination of Kim Jong Nam, the half brother of North Korea\u2019s leader, repeating the mantra that it has \u201cnoticed relevant media reports and is closely following developments. \u201d But behind the scenes, there is a sense of shock and dismay in Beijing, officials and experts say: If indeed Kim Jong Nam was assassinated on the orders of the North Korean leader, it would be seen as an affront to the country that has afforded him protection for many years.",
        "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 Feng Zhang occupies a corner office on the 10th floor of the gleaming, modern biotechnology palace called the Broad Institute. He is one of the most acclaimed young scientists in the United States, regularly mentioned, even at 35, as a possible Nobel laureate. That\u2019s because of CRISPR, the technique that lets scientists manipulate the genetic code of organisms almost like revising a sentence with a word processor. Zhang was one of its pioneers, and on Wednesday he emerged victorious after a bitter patent dispute. The ruling, by judges with the U. S.",
        "Kim Gustafson, wearing her chef\u2019s smock, stood on the iron staircase of Bl\u00fcprint Chocolatiers in the midday drizzle last Sunday to check out the growing crowd of protesters across the street. Ever since her landlord rented the upper two floors of the Old Town Alexandria townhouse to Richard Spencer and his National Policy Institute, a think tank that promotes ideologies, she and her husband, Bruce, had been trying to make sure everyone knew that their designer chocolate shop had nothing to do with the tenant upstairs.",
        "The State Department under Rex Tillerson, who has been among President Trump\u2019s least visible Cabinet officials and is still lacking much of his senior staff, is undergoing further shrinkage in its upper echelons, according to current and former U.

Kristie Kenney, a ambassador and career Foreign Service officer who has served as State Department counselor for the past year, has been told that her services are no longer needed in that job and that her staff is to be reassigned.",
        "One needn\u2019t always perk up at the words \u201cBut wait, there\u2019s more!\u201d which is why it might have seemed, only nine months ago, as if we\u2019d had our fill of the fictional Chicago law firms, courtrooms and political squabbles seen in seven seasons of Robert and Michelle King\u2019s hit CBS drama \u201cThe Good Wife. \u201d Even the most faithful watchers were ready to move on. But what do we know?",
        "MELBOURNE, Fla. \u2014 Nearly a month into a presidency full of missteps, Donald Trump returned Saturday to firmer ground outside of Washington, staging a raucous campaign rally here with a throng of adoring supporters who helped sweep him into the White House. For 45 minutes, there was no talk of the president\u2019s falling approval ratings or turmoil in his administration.",
        "MUNICH \u2014 Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said Saturday the Trump administration is considering a new version of the executive order banning travel of citizens from seven nations that would allow travelers who were already on airplanes bound for the United States into the country, but would bar those who had not yet boarded. \u201cThe president is contemplating releasing a tighter, more streamlined version of the first E. O.,\u201d Kelly told a gathering of the Munich Security Conference.",

John McCain spoke out Saturday in defense of the free press after President Trump lashed out against the news media several times over the past week, at one point declaring it\u00c2 the enemy of the American People! ? Such talk, McCain ( .) said on NBC News in an interview set to air Sunday, was how dictators get started. ? In other words, a consolidation of power, ? McCain told Meet the Press ?",
        "President Trump plans to speak Sunday with at least four candidates to be his next national security adviser, a spokesman said, signaling a desire to swiftly replace the ousted Michael Flynn. White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters Saturday that the candidates include John Bolton, a former United Nations ambassador; Army Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster; Lt. Gen. Robert Caslen, the superintendent of the U. S. Military Academy at West Point; and retired Army Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, who is now serving in an acting capacity.",
        "MUNICH \u2014 Invoking the name of President Trump but not his rhetoric, Vice President Pence on Saturday sought to reassure Europeans of Washington\u2019s robust commitment to transatlantic defense, even as Europe searched for clarity in the contradictory statements coming from the new U. S. administration. Pence told a skeptical audience at the Munich Security Conference that Europeans should rest assured that Washington\u2019s fundamental foreign policy direction was not changing.",
        "The most important relationship in the White House should be the one between President Trump and Vice President Pence. By the accounts of those around the two leaders, that bond is extremely strong. Which makes it even more inexplicable that Pence was kept in the dark during what became one of the biggest headaches to hit the new administration. Pence is in Europe this weekend, representing the administration at the Munich Security Conference and later at several meetings in Brussels with U. S. allies. He offered assurances Saturday, in the name of the president, that the U. S.",
        "DENVER \u2014 It was a horrific case. A female student had been by football players being recruited by the University of Colorado. Now, her lawyers were trying to hold the university partly responsible, arguing it had created a hostile environment for women. A lower court had already rejected their civil rights argument. As her lawyers prepared to appeal in 2007, they had an overarching concern: a federal appellate judge named Neil Gorsuch. Newly appointed to the bench by George W. Bush, Gorsuch was known as a fierce conservative whose writings skewered his liberal adversaries.",

        "In the fall of 2007, Steven Fabre appeared in my courtroom. He was a New York native there to plead guilty to a single count of possession with intent to distribute crack. Fabre was a typical street dealer who found business by approaching cars or pedestrians. He used the proceeds from his sales to feed his own addiction; he\u2019d been using drugs since he was 14. Fabre had a number of convictions for very minor offenses, plus one for selling a small quantity of a controlled substance, for which he received five years of probation when he was 18.",
        "When news broke that Michael Flynn, President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, had discussed U. S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador before Trump was sworn in, the Logan Act was the federal statute of the moment. The New York Times wrote that Flynn\u2019s resignation had \u201celevated interest\u201d in the \u201cdusty\u201d law. NPR noted that the law had \u201cgotten a lot of attention recently and is at the center of the scandal surrounding Flynn. \u201d Time magazine reported that the \u201cobscure law was suddenly on the minds of Washington observers.",
        "Amid the masses of strangers gathered to protest at the Boston Women\u2019s March, I spotted something familiar: that shield \u2014 red, white and blue \u2014 a simple design that holds the weight of so much conviction. Captain America\u2019s iconic getup caught my eye, not only because of the principles it stands for but because he reminds me of another hero of mine. On Dec. 20, 1940, a year into World War II, my grandfather Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, both sons of Jewish immigrants, released the first issue of \u201cCaptain America.",
        "Under President Trump, American foreign policy is returning, many commentators say, to the isolationism that preceded World War II. This line of interpretation (and often attack) emerged during the election: While Hillary Clinton warned that her opponent would \u201ctear up our alliances,\u201d an array of experts supplied such fears with a historical pedigree. As Council on Foreign Relations President Richard Haass put it, Trump stood for a \u201cnew isolationism,\u201d a revival of the 1930s dream of \u201cturning away from global engagement. \u201d The problem is, Trump isn\u2019t an isolationist. He is a militarist, something far worse.",
        "Carlton F. W. Larson is a professor of law at the University of California at Davis and is writing a book about treason and the American Revolution. President Trump promised to do things differently, but the resignation of a national security adviser under a cloud of suspicion of treason was novel even by Trump standards. The political (and social media) landscape is now littered with accusations of treason, not just against Trump officials but against all kinds of other actors as well \u2014 Hillary Clinton Mitch McConnell even the state of California .",

However long the Donald Trump presidency is with us \u2014 eight years, four years or less \u2014 the forces that propelled him to power will not dissipate with his departure.

Barack Obama took the No. 12 spot in his first time on the survey. The poll, released on the eve of Presidents\u2019 Day weekend, is the third one conducted by the wonky cable network over the past 17 years.
