        "Over the weekend, the president of the United States declared the news media \u201cthe enemy of the American People\u201d and publicly decried a terrorist attack in Sweden that happened as a result of the inflow of immigrants to that country, except that there was no such terrorist attack; he apparently got the idea from a segment he saw on the Fox News program \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight. \u201d The former assertion with its fascist undertones led to widespread condemnation, even from \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Chris Wallace, who said the attack \u201ccrosses an important line.",
        "\u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d and \u201cMoonlight,\u201d the stunning movie nominated for eight Oscars that was directed by Barry Jenkins and written by Jenkins and Tarell McCraney, could not be more different. And yet, when the credits rolled on the latter, my emotions reminded me of the way I felt after seeing the former 12 years ago. What I\u2019d just watched in each film was a powerful love story beautifully rendered with understated grace.",
        "When President Trump mentioned Sweden in scary terms at his Saturday rally, people didn\u2019t know what he was talking about. The topic was immigration and the need for tight restrictions. \u201cHere\u2019s the bottom line,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep our country safe. You look at what\u2019s happening. We\u2019ve got to keep our country safe. You look at what\u2019s happening in Germany, you look at what\u2019s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They\u2019re having problems like they never thought possible. \u201d Bolding added to highlight a \u201chuh?\u201d moment.",
        "\u201cWe are as gods and we might as well get good at it. \u201d So wrote futurist Stewart Brand in the introduction to the first Whole Earth Catalog in 1968. At the time the statement seemed . Nearly 50 years later it\u2019s much less of a joke. The past 30 days have seen several unheralded but consequential strides in the scientific quest for control of our destiny.",
        "Vitaly I. Churkin, who had been Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations for more than a decade and championed Moscow\u2019s perspective on barbarity in Syria, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and other global flash points, died Feb. 20 at a hospital in New York. He died a day before his 65th birthday. Russia\u2019s deputy U. N. ambassador, Vladimir Safronkov, said that his boss fell ill at his office. The cause wasn\u2019t immediately known. Mr. Churkin was the member of the Security Council, the United Nations\u2019 most powerful body.",
        "President Trump caused confusion during a Saturday rally in Florida when he said: \u201cYou look at what\u2019s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this?\u201d Trump then mentioned the French cities of Nice and Paris and the Belgian capital, Brussels. The three European cities were attacked by terrorists over the past two years. Although Trump did not explicitly say it, his remarks were widely perceived in the United States and abroad as suggesting that an attack had occurred Friday night in Sweden. At a Florida rally on Feb.",
        "A few days after Stephen K. Bannon was named chief strategist in President Trump\u2019s White House, one of his proteges praised him on British television. \u201cI am a gay Jew and he made me a star,\u201d Milo Yiannopoulos, the frequently profane Breitbart. com columnist and cyber provocateur, told a Channel 4 interviewer in November. While Bannon oversaw the Breitbart News Network, Yiannopoulos built an enthusiastic fan base for his caustic writings.",
        "LONDON \u2014 British lawmakers on Monday kicked off a debate on whether to withdraw an invitation to President Trump for a state visit \u2014 an offer that had been extended by the British prime minister with un precedented speed. The debate, held in Parliament\u2019s Westminster Hall, was triggered after a petition calling on the British government to cancel the state visit amassed more than 1. 8 million signatures. A urging the government to support the visit, signed by 300, 000, was also being debated.",
        "BAGHDAD \u2014 The Pentagon is deploying U. S. military advisers closer to the front lines in the campaign against the Islamic State as Iraqi security forces wrestle for control of the city of Mosul, the top U. S. commander here said Monday. Army Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend said that the advisers, numbering about 450, are \u201coperating closer and deeper into Iraqi formations\u201d as a new assault on western Mosul gets underway. U. S.",
        "President Trump, who pledged as a candidate to limit his golfing to when it was also conducive to conducting business, played a full round Sunday with Rory McIlroy, one of the best players in the world, a spokeswoman said Monday. McIlroy rode in the cart for all 18 holes with the president at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla. according to No Laying Up, a golfing publication, which also quoted McIlroy saying that Trump \u201cprobably shot around 80.",
        "The conservative movement in America now belongs to President Trump. Thousands of activists will arrive in Washington this week for an annual gathering that will vividly display how Trump has pushed the Republican Party and the conservative movement toward an \u201cAmerica first\u201d nationalism that has long existed on the fringes. \u201cEvery movement that gets dusty or sclerotic relies on an infusion of energy from the bottom up,\u201d said White House counselor Kellyanne Conway. \u201cIt also takes a transformative individual to bring about change.",
        "The Trump administration on Tuesday sought to allay growing fears among immigrant communities over new directives to ramp up enforcement against illegal immigrants, insisting the measures are not intended to produce \u201cmass deportations. \u201d Federal officials cautioned that many of the changes detailed in a pair of memos from Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly will take time to implement because of costs and logistical challenges and that border patrol agents and immigration officers will use their expanded powers with care and discretion.",
        "After a rash of bomb threats at Jewish community centers nationwide and vandalism at a Jewish cemetery over the weekend, President Trump was pressed for a response more forceful than those he offered during news conferences last week. Asked about that spike in activity last Wednesday, Trump chose first to talk about his electoral vote totals, implying that concerns that he may be tacitly supporting actions were offset by the \u201ctremendous enthusiasm\u201d his candidacy had received.",
        "More than any other officer of his generation, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster\u2019s military career has been defined by a willingness to dissent \u2014 often forcefully. In \u201cDereliction of Duty,\u201d the book he wrote in the 1990s, McMaster blasted the nation\u2019s top generals for their unwillingness to tell a domineering president that his war strategy in Vietnam could not work. More than a decade later, as the commander of a regiment in Iraq, McMaster essentially ignored the U. S. military\u2019s prevailing plan for stabilizing the country, which he concluded was failing badly.",
        "Thomas a military man, deployed twice to Afghanistan. The second time, as a Marine corporal in 2010, he led an infantry team into combat. Two of his men were wounded by enemy sniper fire, and one of his best buddies later died in combat. Now President Trump says Thomas is an enemy of the American people. Thomas, a Pentagon correspondent for The Post, was so labeled, along with everybody else in the media, by the commander in chief on Friday.",
        "I promised myself that I\u2019d spend less of 2017 dissecting the provocations of assorted jerks and frauds. I held out for a while. But as Milo Yiannopoulos\u2019s reign as the latest conservative enfant terrible crumbled this weekend over video of him suggesting that very young teenagers can consent to sex with adults, with organizers of the Conservative Political Action Conference rescinding a speaking invitation that they had extended to him and a conservative imprint of Simon & Schuster canceling his $250, 000 book contract, it seemed worthwhile to note one particular element of his confidence game.",
        "Remember when conservatism meant deep thinkers and big ideas? Get over it. Today, conservatism means get your Miley (Cyrus) on and show us your tongue, shout Trump to the rafters, pay up for the privilege of \u201cfree speech,\u201d and young \u2014 very young \u2014 \u201clove. \u201d Or so it would seem, judging by this year\u2019s to the annual Conservative Political Action Conference that begins here Wednesday. If young conservatives came looking for mentors and for values confirmation, they may have wasted their ticket.",
        "Financial markets have been sending an interesting message about President Trump and Russia. After Trump\u2019s election, investors seemed to be betting that sanctions against Moscow would soon be eased. But this confidence collapsed in late January, and Russian stocks plummeted. The numbers tell the story: From Nov. 7, the day before the election, to Jan. 27, the MICEX index of leading Russian stocks rose 26 percent. The index for Russian financial stocks increased 19 percent over that same period. But this upward momentum suddenly reversed: As of Tuesday, the MICEX index had fallen 10.",
        "IN THE fiscal year that ended last fall, the number of undocumented immigrants apprehended on the southwestern border was just a quarter the number in 2000 and less than half the annual count during most of George W. Bush s administration. Although last year s apprehensions in the Southwest rose from the previous year  \u201d largely because of unaccompanied minors and families from Central America seeking refugee status  \u201d the overall number was among the lowest since the turn of the century. Nonetheless, Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly has somehow conjured what he called a",
        "Bill de Blasio is mayor of New York. Like many Democrats, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time since Nov. 8 wondering what went wrong. Though Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, it\u2019s clear to me that too many voters stayed home because they felt the election was more about personalities than the issues that affect their lives. But what we\u2019ve seen in the days after the inauguration is nothing short of incredible.",
        "The Trump administration plans to roll back protections for transgender students and is preparing changes to federal guidance that required the nation\u2019s public schools to allow students to use the bathrooms and locker rooms that matched their gender identities. A White House spokesman said Tuesday that the Education and Justice departments would soon issue new guidance on the matter. He hinted that it would be different from the Obama administration\u2019s position, which was that denying transgender students the right to use the bathroom of their choice violates federal prohibitions against sex discrimination.",
        "Just two days after President Trump provoked widespread consternation by seeming to imply, incorrectly, that immigrants had perpetrated a recent spate of violence in Sweden, riots broke out in a predominantly immigrant neighborhood in the northern suburbs of the country\u2019s capital, Stockholm. The neighborhood, Rinkeby, was the scene of riots in 2010 and 2013, too. And in most ways, what happened Monday night was reminiscent of those earlier bouts of anger. Swedish police apparently made an arrest about 8 p. m. near the Rinkeby station.",
        "In his first full work day as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt made clear Tuesday that he intends to step back from what he sees as the agency\u2019s regulatory overreach during the Obama administration. Pruitt, who spent years criticizing and suing the EPA before becoming its newest leader, reiterated an argument he often had made as Oklahoma attorney general. \u201cThe only authority that any agency has in the executive branch is the authority given to it by Congress,\u201d he said during a noon address to employees at the agency headquarters. \u201cWe need to respect that.",
        "Late last month, a pair of Islamic State fighters in desert camouflage climbed to the top of a river bluff in northern Iraq to demonstrate an important new weapon: a small drone, about six feet wide with swept wings and a small bomb tucked in its fuselage. The two men launched the slender machine and took videos from a second, smaller drone that shadowed its movements.",

President Trump\u2019s speech over the weekend along Florida\u2019s Space Coast \u2014 effectively a campaign rally staged just one month into his term \u2014 served, more than anything else, as an illustration of the extent of the political polarization now gripping the United States. Trump had already declared open war on his country\u2019s media, describing the mainstream press as the \u201denemy\u201d of the American people.",
        "OROVILLE, Calif. \u2014 Larry Bowen ducked beneath the large white portico to escape the freshly falling rain, the first droplets of a thick storm that would pour down over Northern California later that night. He and his wife, Robin, came to this hillside outpost to look out at the Oroville Dam, like hundreds of others in recent days who were suddenly all too aware of infrastructure, spillways and reservoir levels.",
        "We haven\u2019t had much of a \u201cwinter\u201d in Washington, and spring is almost here \u2014 though I could argue it already arrived. The plants are obviously going to leave their dormancy early (the crocuses are up!) which has us wondering about the cherry blossoms. Last month was the January since the year 2000, and the January since records began in Washington. It didn\u2019t drop below freezing for 19 days in a row, which is not only a streak for the month, but also just plain strange; January is typically the coldest month in the capital.",
        "Photographer Timo Lieber\u2019s new photo series, \u201cThaw,\u201d captures one of the most startling and visible ways we can witness the melting of Greenland\u2019s ice sheet. In July 2016, he photographed from above the melt lakes, which accumulate on top. A host of factors make it difficult to estimate exactly how fast Greenland is melting (a question for which NASA hopes to have an answer in a few years). But what is clear is that the overall melt of the ice sheet is a major contributor to the rising of the ocean.",
        "In his previous role as Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general, the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s new administrator regularly huddled with fossil fuel firms and electric utilities about how to combat federal environmental regulations and spoke to conservative political groups about what they called government \u201coverreach,\u201d according to thousands of pages of emails made public Wednesday.",
        "BLACKSTONE, Va. \u2014 Main Street had some new fixtures Tuesday alongside the quiet antique stores, the sturdy masonry, the bright gas stations, the Baptist churches. There was the Clinton supporter who had breast surgery six weeks ago and drove an hour and 25 minutes, during rush hour, to be heard. There was the Trump supporter who stuck around despite the cane in his hand and the cancer in his body."
