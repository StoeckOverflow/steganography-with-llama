        "In my inaugural rankings of the four most powerful advisers to President Trump last week, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus finished dead last. Priebus was under fire for the chaos surrounding the president and his policies, and there was open speculation not only that he might be fired but also about who might replace him. What a difference a week makes in Trumpworld! Below are my rankings of the most \u2014 and least \u2014 powerful members of the Trump Big Four.",
        "A newfound solar system just 39 away contains seven warm, rocky planets, scientists say. The discovery, reported Wednesday in the journal Nature, represents the first time astronomers have detected so many terrestrial planets orbiting a single star. Researchers say the system is an ideal laboratory for studying distant worlds and could be the best place in the galaxy to search for life beyond Earth.",
        "RAMADI, Iraq \u2014 The Islamic State is nearing defeat on the battlefield, but away from the front lines its members are seeping back into areas the group once controlled, taking advantage of rampant corruption in Iraq\u2019s security forces and institutions. Police officers, judges and local officials describe an uneven hand of justice that allows some Islamic State collaborators to walk, dimming Iraq\u2019s chances of escaping the cycle of violence that has plagued the country since the 2003 U. S. invasion.",
        "Lanae Erickson Hatalsky is vice president of social policy and politics and Jim Kessler is senior vice president for policy at Third Way, a centrist think tank. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. Instead of holding a number of elected offices at the federal, state and local levels, Democrats were supposed to have unshakable majorities. Instead of relying on a handful of \u201cblue wall\u201d states in the upper Midwest to preserve Democrats\u2019 electoral college advantage, the party was supposed to expand into territory once held by Republicans.",
        "A new Quinnipiac poll finds that President Trump\u2019s approval rating has soared all the way up to 38 percent. And a majority of Americans overall say they trust the media, not Trump, to tell them the truth about important issues. But a huge majority of Republicans say they trust Trump, not the media, to tell them the truth: More whites ( ) and white men ( ) also see Trump as the one telling the truth.",
        "Republicans\u2019 attempt to elevate Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( .) \u2014 as evidence there are (gasp!) liberal New Englanders in the Democratic Party \u2014 reminds us the party has not come to terms with majority status. Trying to make a liberal lawmaker the face of the Democratic Party was the sort of political stunt Republicans tried during the Obama years when Sen. Harry Reid ( .) and Rep. Nancy Pelosi ( .) would up featured \u2014 in grainy black and white photos \u2014 more frequently in Republican than Democratic ads.",
        "There was a brief moment after Donald Trump\u2019s election when it was conceivable to ask whether he would strive to be a \u201cuniter\u201d or a \u201cdivider. \u201d The moment passed quickly as Trump made it clear that he does not intend to abandon the style of politics \u2014 insulting and divisive \u2014 that got him elected. His declaration last week that the news media are \u201cthe enemy of the American People\u201d is but the latest reminder. Trump\u2019s theory of politics is that it\u2019s okay to offend five voters if seven voters approve.",
        "The Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act is not going well, in large part because it turns out that making sweeping changes to a system that encompasses of the American economy turns out to be rather more complicated than they imagined. Their backtracking has an interesting character to it, in particular how they\u2019ve been gobsmacked by the transition from shaking their fists at the system to being responsible for it.",
        "Richard Glover is an Australian writer and broadcaster. For years, my American friends have found Australian politics incomprehensible. \u201cWhat?\u201d they\u2019ll say. \u201cYou can fire the leader of your country, just like that, without any legal reason? That\u2019s ridiculous. \u201d This incredulous response has always been the American view of political life down under. Take, for example, the events of December 1967, when our Prime Minister Harold Holt went missing, presumed drowned, while he was off an isolated beach. \u201cWhat? The guy who is effectively your president? You mislaid him? That\u2019s ridiculous.",
        "A Republican member of the Senate Intelligence Committee says she is open to requesting President Trump\u2019s tax returns as part of the panel\u2019s ongoing investigation into Russia\u2019s alleged meddling in the 2016 elections. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine made the remark to a local radio program on Wednesday in which she stated that \u201cmany of the members\u201d on the Intelligence panel will formally request that ousted national security adviser Michael T. Flynn testify before the committee.",
        "It\u2019s pretty clear what President Trump is doing by going after the media. He sees someone who is tough on him, with a lower approval rating, and he sets up a contrast. It\u2019s like making yourself look taller by standing next to a short person. \u201cYou have a lower approval rate than Congress,\u201d he needled reporters at last week\u2019s news conference, making clear he had done the math. Except maybe it\u2019s not really working.",
        "Months after a protest of the Dakota Access oil pipeline swelled into a movement that drew thousands of people and national attention, most of the demonstrators left the protest camp ahead of deadline Wednesday, leaving a few dozens to face possible arrest. Even before the 2 p. m. evacuation deadline, imposed last week by North Dakota\u2019s governor, the main protest camp had already turned into a muddy pit, the ground soggy with melted snow.",
        "BRASILIA \u2014 Some of the world\u2019s most iconic companies cast themselves as emblems of their nation\u2019s values \u2014 for instance, or quintessentially Japanese Toyota. And for a while, that was also true of the Brazilian construction behemoth Odebrecht. In a good way. Odebrecht was on a cloud during the first decade of the millennium, when Brazil won hosting rights to the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games, affirming its status as a rising star.",
        "LONDON \u2014 A British suicide bomber who blew himself up in Iraq was identified as a former Guantanamo Bay detainee, prompting questions about how his case was handled after lawmakers and the media lobbied hard for his release. Jamal is said to have detonated a bomb this week at an army base near Mosul. The Islamic State identified the bomber as Abu Zakariya a Muslim convert from Manchester. He was born Ronald Fiddler and was known more widely in Britain as Jamal .",
        "The big airlines have jumped into the \u201cbasic economy\u201d market, competing with the airlines that cater to the most frugal passengers. Within hours of each other, American and United announced that they had begun selling basic economy fares that push down the price of a ticket. The lower price can come with caveats, however, including having to pay extra for space in the overhead bin, boarding last and not having the option to seats when booking the tickets. Analysts said the big airlines are going after the market more aggressively after watching the upstarts become so successful.",
        "Fewer than of Americans are saving money in their 401( k)s and other workplace retirement accounts, according to an analysis of tax records by Census Bureau researchers. Although nearly 80 percent of Americans work for an employer that offers retirement programs \u2014 whether a 401( k) 403( b) or something else \u2014 only 32 percent of workers sign up for such accounts, according to a working draft of the study by Michael Gideon and Joshua Mitchell.",
        "Mildred Dresselhaus, who grew up in a rough New York neighborhood, became one of America\u2019s foremost physicists and worked to encourage other women to enter such seemingly daunting occupations, died Feb. 20 at a hospital in Cambridge, Mass. She was 86. The death was announced by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she was a faculty member for 50 years. No cause was reported. Dr.",

(Bain News of Congress) Dog shows are famous for their spirit, their spunk and, as satirized in Christopher Guest\u2019s 2000 film \u201cBest in Show,\u201d their cult following.",
        "The reclusive mastermind behind President Trump\u2019s nationalist ideology and combative tactics made his public debut Thursday, delivering a fiery rebuke of the media and declaring that the new administration is in an unending battle for \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state. \u201d Stephen K. Bannon, the White House chief strategist and intellectual force behind Trump\u2019s agenda, used his first speaking appearance since Trump took office to vow that the president would honor all of the pledges of his campaign.",
        "Richard Spencer, a founder of the movement that seeks a state and that strongly backed Donald Trump for president, was expelled from the Conservative Political Action Conference after being criticized from its main stage, then giving interviews to a growing crowd of reporters. \u201cPeople want to talk to me,\u201d Spencer told NBC News from outside the Gaylord National Harbor complex. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to talk to these boring conservatives. They want to learn about ideas whose time has come, not whose time has passed.",
        "Kellyanne Conway, the first woman to run a successful U. S. presidential campaign, said Thursday that she doesn\u2019t consider herself a feminist \u201cin a classic sense\u201d because the term is associated with being \u201c \u201d and \u201c . \u201d Conway, who now serves as White House counselor to President Trump, made her comments at the Conservative Political Action Conference at National Harbor in Maryland, where she also praised Trump\u2019s hiring of women and encouraged women to run for president.",
        "Sen. Ted Cruz predicted Thursday that there will be another vacancy on the Supreme Court later this year but provided no explanation for why he believes that is likely to happen. Cruz ( .) also appeared to suggest that a departure of one of justices from the liberal wing of the court would trigger the opening. \u201cThe Scalia seat is defense,\u201d said Cruz, talking about the opening left by Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last February. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get any better than Justice Scalia.",
        "GARNER, Iowa \u2014 When a voter here asked whether Sen. Charles E. Grassley supports a probe of President Trump\u2019s tax returns, the Republican gave a qualified \u201cyes. \u201d In Virginia, asked about Russian interference in the presidential election, Rep. David Brat said an investigator should \u201cfollow the rule of law wherever it leads. \u201d And in Arkansas, Sen. Tom Cotton told 1, 400 people sardined into a high school auditorium that the Affordable Care Act \u201chas helped Arkansans.",
        "President Trump on Thursday celebrated what he called \u201ca military operation\u201d to round up and deport undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes or caused violence in the United States. \u201cWe\u2019re getting gang members out, we\u2019re getting drug lords out, we\u2019re getting really bad dudes out of this country \u2014 and at a rate that nobody\u2019s ever seen before,\u201d Trump told a group of several dozen manufacturing executives during a policy discussion at the White House.",
        "After the Trump administration revoked federal guidelines on transgender student rights, officials from New York to Washington to Tulsa moved quickly this week to assure their communities that they would continue to allow students to use school bathrooms aligned with their gender identity. But other districts had never complied with the Obama administration\u2019s guidance after it was issued in May \u2014 and they don\u2019t plan to do so now. That leaves intact a patchwork of policies on transgender student accommodations that varies widely across the country.",
        "At the heart of President Trump\u2019s foreign policy team lies a glaring contradiction. On the one hand, it is composed of men of experience, judgment and traditionalism. Meaning, they are all very much within the parameters of mainstream American internationalism as practiced since 1945. Practically every member of the team \u2014 the heads of State, Homeland Security, the CIA, and most especially Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and national security adviser H. R. McMaster \u2014 could fit in a Cabinet put together by, say, Hillary Clinton.",
        "Julian Gewirtz is the author of \u201cUnlikely Partners: Chinese Reformers, Western Economists, and the Making of Global China. \u201d President Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d philosophy has increased tensions around the world, but the biggest shoe has yet to drop: He hasn\u2019t laid out his policies toward China, a country he has repeatedly denounced . As a American who grew up traveling to the country and studying its language, I fear that Trump\u2019s aggressive actions toward China could be his most potent threat to the safety and prosperity of the world that my generation will inherit.",
        "Arne Duncan was U. S. education secretary from 2009 to 2015. Catherine Lhamon, assistant education secretary for civil rights from 2013 until January, is chair of the U. S. Commission on Civil Rights. This week\u2019s decision by the Trump administration to withdraw guidance to school communities about how to protect transgender students reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the federal role in protecting the civil rights of students. Worse yet, it confuses states and school districts, and puts real, live children at greater risk of harm.",
        "One of the most startling allegations in a January report by U. S. intelligence agencies about Russian hacking was this sentence: \u201cRussia has sought to influence elections across Europe. \u201d This warning of a campaign far broader than the United States got little attention in America. We may be missing the forest for the trees in the Russia story: The Kremlin\u2019s attempt to meddle in the 2016 U. S. presidential election is part of a much bigger tale of Russian covert action \u2014 in which Donald Trump\u2019s campaign was perhaps a tool, witting or unwitting.",
        "By now it is settled wisdom that we are witnessing the rise of radical forces on the left and right around the globe. Populists of both varieties, who share a disdain for globalization, are energized, certain that the future is going their way. But the center is rising again, even in the heart of the old world. Consider Emmanuel Macron, the former Rothschild banker who is the favorite to become France\u2019s next president. Polls indicate that the candidate, Marine Le Pen, is leading the field in the first round with about 25 percent of the vote."
