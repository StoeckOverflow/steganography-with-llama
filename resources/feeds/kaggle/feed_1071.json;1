        "Dalibor Rohac is a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. To any observer, President Trump\u2019s authoritarian instincts, Twitter outbursts and divisive rhetoric should be greatly concerning. Americans might take comfort in the fact that the United States is not the first country to elect and live under such a leader. I would know. Two and a half years after the fall of communism in 1989, the ruthless and charismatic Vladimir Meciar was elected as prime minister in my home country of Slovakia after a brief previous stint in the office.",

        "During a White House briefing Thursday, press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters that \u201cI do believe that you\u2019ll see greater enforcement\u201d of federal drug laws prohibiting use of recreational marijuana during the Trump administration. But medical marijuana is a different question, Spicer said, noting that states with medical marijuana laws were protected from federal interference by a congressional budget rider passed in 2014. Spicer\u2019s comments are the strongest suggestion yet that the Trump administration will take more of a hard line approach to marijuana enforcement than the Obama administration.",
        "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 When the Pakistan army announced that it was launching a nationwide military operation to \u201cindiscriminately\u201d eliminate the threat of terrorism from the land, the adverb had a precise and politically loaded meaning. For the first time, after years of appeasing certain Islamist militant groups for political and religious reasons, the government has reluctantly agreed to allow the armed forces to enter Punjab province, authorized with special powers to hunt down, arrest and shoot suspected militants. Punjab is the political stronghold of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his ruling party, the Pakistan Muslim .",

        "President Trump, addressing the annual Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday, reminisced about the \u201cvery exciting\u201d moment several years ago when he had his coming out as a conservative. I was there when Trump spoke at that 2011 CPAC gathering, at its former site in the Marriott ballroom in Washington\u2019s Woodley Park neighborhood. Then, as now, Trump was angry. But he didn\u2019t utter a peep that day about immigration or the border wall, terrorism, or Iran or Iraq \u2014 the issues that motivate him now. What made him mad then was gas prices.",
        "After some reflection and attempts to dissect what Stephen Bannon said in his Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) appearance yesterday, I came to the realization that Bannon sort of reminds me of Nick Nolte\u2019s character, Four Leaf Tayback, in the 2008 movie \u201cTropic Thunder. \u201d The premise of \u201cTropic Thunder,\u201d for those of you who haven\u2019t seen it, is that Tayback writes a Vietnam War book and then acts as a consultant when his book goes into production as a movie.",
        "President Trump\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference speech included everything that was good and nothing that was bad. It is a shame, he said during the speech, that the fake media is always citing \u201csources\u201d to tell stories that are not favorable. In keeping with these new guidelines, I will cite no sources whatsoever when I tell you how wonderful this speech was. Trump, who shone like a hot ball of gas the sun, was introduced by Matt and Mercedes Schlapp, who said that the last time a sitting president had addressed CPAC, it was Ronald Reagan.",
