        "From its very first moments, \u201cGet Out\u201d puts viewers in a squirm inducing state of discomfort and outright hilarity that doesn\u2019t let up until its final act. The sly, directorial debut of Jordan Peele \u2014 one half of the brilliant comic duo Key and Peele \u2014 this horror film has roots as firmly planted in the works of Jonathan Swift as John Carpenter, interleaving acidic social satire between the jump scares.",
        "ATLANTA \u2014 Former labor secretary Thomas Perez was elected the first Latino chair of the Democratic National Committee on Saturday, narrowly defeating Rep. Keith Ellison ( .) at the end of a contentious battle over the fate of the beleaguered party in the age of President Trump. Perez\u2019s victory concluded the first contested race for the DNC leadership since 1985, a contest the party had extended by a month to allow more debate.",
        "\u201cWe cannot escape our destiny, nor should we try to do so,\u201d Ronald Reagan told one of the first CPAC gatherings in January 1974. \u201cThe leadership of the free world was thrust upon us two centuries ago in that little hall of Philadelphia. \u201d Quoting Pope Pius XII after World War II, Reagan said, \u201cInto the hands of America, God has placed the destinies of an afflicted mankind. \u201d Contrast that with what President Trump said Friday when he addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference.",
        "These days, Tip O\u2019Neill must be rolling over in his grave. The late House speaker famously declared that \u201call politics is local,\u201d but that adage has been put to the test over the past decade by an increased level of national news consumption by an electorate watching cable TV and reading the Facebook pages of friends across the country. In the age of President Trump, surging seas of activists on the left and the right are drowning out local issues and forcing senators and representatives to answer locally for every national controversy.",
        "A senior Republican lawmaker on Friday agreed that a special prosecutor should investigate Russia\u2019s alleged interference with the 2016 presidential election. Rep. Darrell Issa ( .) became one of the few Republican representatives to state publicly the need for an independent investigation into Russia\u2019s reported election meddling. This comes as Democrats have increasingly pushed for an investigation into President Trump\u2019s associates\u2019 ties to Russia.",
        "Mary Carson picks up her tote bag and tugs on her scarf. \u201cI\u2019m just going to do a little bit of business,\u201d the says as she walks into Neiman Marcus at the Tysons Galleria in Northern Virginia and asks for the manager. He appears in a pinstripe suit and shakes her hand. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in what\u2019s happened with the Trump line,\u201d she tells him. \u201cI hate to do this \u2014 I\u2019m not a real activist \u2014 but I learned a long, long time ago that you cannot mix business and politics. \u201d The manager listens patiently.",
        "President Trump will not attend the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner, after a campaign and early tenure where he continually battled with the press. Trump announced his decision on Twitter late Saturday afternoon. The dinner is scheduled for April 29. I will not be attending the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening! \u2014 Donald J.",
        "On \u201cFox & Friends\u201d Saturday morning, former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain credited President Trump with reducing the national debt, after just one month in office. \u201cAnd here\u2019s another statistic that I haven\u2019t heard anybody talk about. Did you know that the national debt in President Trump\u2019s first month went down $12 billion?\u201d Cain asked the hosts. Less than an hour later, the statistic appeared on another highly visible platform. \u201cThe media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo,\u201d Trump tweeted.",
        "Last spring, while reporting The Washington Post\u2019s biography of Donald Trump, I asked an executive who had worked for Trump for more than three decades to help me understand a central contradiction about the man: How could he be at once the micromanager who in the 1980s would call an employee at 2 a. m. and order her out of bed to clean up litter he\u2019d noticed in the lobby of one of his buildings, and also the boss who was so detached that he claimed to be ignorant of his hotels\u2019 finances as they fell into bankruptcy?",

Bush for policy and planning. Shah served as USAID administrator under President Barack Obama. We have entered the era of \u201cAmerica first\u201d with only a vague understanding of its meaning. President Trump\u2019s inaugural address signaled an ambitious nationalist reimagining of the War II international order.",
        "On the eve of his biggest mission, in a career marked by hard jobs done well, Col. H. R. McMaster explained to me how the United States could win the battle for the city of Tal Afar and, eventually, the Iraq War. It was a bold belief at the time: August 2005, the dog days of a long, bloody summer, during which a brutal insurgency had plunged Iraq to the brink of civil war. American casualties mounted, and there was no clear strategy for turning the tide.",
        "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 Last spring, when I heard Donald Trump say that Caitlyn Jenner could use whatever bathroom she wanted at Trump Tower, I breathed a sigh of relief. There weren\u2019t many things Trump and I agreed on, but this was one. Surely, I hoped, if he became president, he would extend the same courtesy to my daughter, Henry. That hope was destroyed Wednesday night, when Trump\u2019s administration rescinded the federal order that protects kids in public schools so they can use the bathroom that fits their gender identity.",
        "In the late \u201950s and early \u201960s, James Baldwin was a gay black intellectual living and writing essays and novels in New York and Paris. I was a white kid living in North Carolina, being raised by a single mother and working construction jobs to save money for college. Somehow I stumbled onto Baldwin, the subject of a brilliant documentary, Raoul Peck\u2019s \u201cI Am Not Your Negro\u201d up for an Academy Award on Sunday. No writer has had a greater influence on my life.",

        "In 1973, attorney John Dean sat before the Senate Watergate Committee and recounted the grimy details of the scandal that brought Richard Nixon\u2019s presidency to a premature end. Dean had pored over 600 hours of secretly recorded White House tapes and admitted he had been involved in strategic conversations about illegal activity. During the final months of Nixon\u2019s presidency, Dean testified against the commander in chief \u2014 words that helped end a presidency and landed Dean in prison. Now, 44 years later, the man who experienced presidential scandal up close says he has a case of deja vu.",
        "MEXICO CITY \u2014 Confrontation with the United States is so central to Mexican history there\u2019s an institution dedicated to the trauma. It\u2019s called the Museum of Interventions. Remember the Alamo? They do here \u2014 as the prelude to a string of defeats, invasions and territorial losses that left Mexico wounded and diminished, its national identity forged by grievance. The museum is housed in a former convent where Mexican troops were overrun by U. S. soldiers in the 1847 Battle of Churubusco.",
        "It\u2019s become an American tradition to parse billionaire Warren Buffett\u2019s annual letters to his shareholders for nuggets of insight, wit and sometimes a dash of politics. In this year\u2019s letter, the Berkshire Hathaway chairman brought up a familiar subject under Donald Trump\u2019s presidency: immigrants. \u201cAmericans have combined human ingenuity, a market system, a tide of talented and ambitious immigrants, and the rule of law to deliver abundance beyond any dreams of our forefathers,\u201d Buffett wrote \u2014 ostensibly as reason to be optimistic about the company\u2019s future earnings.",
        "In the hour before and after Kim Jong Nam was supposed to fly from Malaysia to Macau at 10 a. m. on Feb. 13, nearly 200 flights were scheduled to fly to or from Kuala Lumpur.

        "Before Srinivas Kuchibhotla\u2019s death in a possible hate crime, his family warned him about the dangers of remaining in the United States. His wife was unsure whether they should stay, even as they planned to start a family in Kansas. \u201cI told him many times we should think about going back [to India],\u201d Sunayana Dumala said at a news conference Friday.

        "It\u2019s just over a month into Hillary Clinton\u2019s historic presidency, and Milo Yiannopoulos works as a Starbucks barista, the Koch brothers have fled the country and the first woman to occupy the Oval Office is the sober, exacting policy wonk that millions of Americans expected. Her approval ratings are skyrocketing, her news conferences \u201coppressively intelligent,\u201d \u201cboring\u201d and \u201ctoo sane. \u201d And her vanquished political opponent, Donald Trump, is on the verge of being charged with treason by the Department of Justice.

        "Pro golfer Rory McIlroy found himself on the defense on Friday, less than a week after joining President Trump in Florida for a round of golf at the Trump International Golf Club. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t an endorsement nor a political statement of any kind,\u201d the Northern Irishman posted to Twitter. \u201cIt was, quite simply, a round of golf. \u201d pic. twitter. \u2014 Rory McIlroy (@McIlroyRory) February 24, 2017 The majors winner faced an onslaught of criticism online after he accepted Trump\u2019s invitation to join him in West Palm Beach, Fla.",
        "\u201cEustace Vladimirovich Tilley,\u201d by Barry Blitt. (Fran\u00e7oise New Yorker) THE FIRST New Yorker cover, featuring the iconically monocled character Eustace Tilley, landed on news stands 92 years ago this month. Now, in a nod to both the anniversary and our modern geopolitical times, the magazine\u2019s mascot has been transformed into \u201cEustace Vladimirovich Tilley,\u201d who turns his glassy gaze toward a small, fluttering Donald Trump.

        "ISLAMABAD \u2014 In Pakistan\u2019s vast and highly stratified society, tens of millions of people endure daily deprivation, humiliation and grinding toil for pennies. Occasionally an especially egregious case makes the headlines, such as a recent scandal about the brutal treatment of a girl working as a maid for the family of a prominent judge. For the most part, though, the struggling masses remain invisible. Some beg at traffic signals as SUVs charge past, or silently sweep patios at luxurious homes.",

        "This is the kind of dish that will drive your family crazy because not 10 minutes after you pop it into the oven, the house fills with the smell of garlic butter. It\u2019s based on a wonderful recipe by my good friend and mentor, cookbook author Jean Anderson, with choice ingredients added to take it to the next level. Think of it as a less messy version of fried chicken. I\u2019ve never met a chicken eater who wasn\u2019t wild for it. But be sure to stick to the recipe to achieve the best results.",
        "A meeting Friday afternoon between President Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, his former rival in the GOP primaries, had no set agenda. But Kasich came armed with one anyway: his hope to blunt drastic changes to the nation\u2019s system envisioned by some conservatives in Washington. Over the next 45 minutes, according to Kasich and others briefed on the session, the governor made his pitch while the president eagerly called in several top aides and then got Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price on the phone.",
