        "Immigration lawyers and advocacy groups are advising undocumented immigrants not to enroll in a federal program created by President Barack Obama over fears that the Trump administration will use their personal information to detain and deport them.

Kelly that aim to ramp up deportations of the nation\u2019s 11 million undocumented immigrants.",

I\u2019ve known Daniel Ellsberg for only five minutes, but, curious, I unwind it from my neck and give it over. with a flick of his wrist, the famous Pentagon Papers whistleblower produces an elegant knot. With another flick, the knot disappears. Not a bad feat, though it hardly measures up to his copying and leaking thousands of pages of classified documents on the Vietnam War to the New York Times \u2014 an act that eventually changed the course of history.",
        "Trinidad and Tobago \u2014 Every year, an onslaught of soca music is released ahead of Trinidad\u2019s Carnival. The songs are new, but the themes are : Rum. Partying. And the allure of a woman\u2019s gyrating body, preferably backed into a man\u2019s grasp. So it\u2019s a little surprising that one of this year\u2019s most popular Carnival tunes is a jaunty ballad performed by the music legend Calypso Rose and titled \u201cLeave Me Alone. \u201d The song features a woman trying to party in the streets without interference from men, exhorting them to \u201cleave me, let me free up.",

Wapner, a retired California judge whose style of resolving disputes on the show \u201cThe People\u2019s Court\u201d helped spawn an entire genre of reality television with jurists and often clueless litigants, died Feb. 26 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 97. A grandson, Gabriel Wapner, confirmed the death but did not know the immediate cause. Judge Wapner had several strokes in recent years. \u201cThe People\u2019s Court,\u201d which the Wapner hosted from 1981 to 1993, was a syndicated show that turned private arbitration of cases into highly engrossing entertainment.",
        "President Trump will propose a federal budget that would significantly increase spending by $54 billion while cutting other federal agencies by the same amount, an administration official said. The proposal represents a major increase in federal spending related to national security, while other priorities, especially foreign aid, would face massive reductions. According to the White House, the defense budget would increase by 10 percent. Trump also will request $30 billion in supplementary military spending for fiscal 2017, an administration official said.",
        "Hundreds of former employees of Sterling Jewelers, the conglomerate behind Jared the Galleria of Jewelry and Kay Jewelers, claim that its chief executive and other company leaders presided over a corporate culture that fostered rampant sexual harassment and discrimination, according to arbitration documents obtained by The Washington Post. Declarations from roughly 250 women and men who worked at Sterling, filed as part of a private arbitration case, allege that female employees at the company throughout the late 1990s and 2000s were routinely groped, demeaned and urged to sexually cater to their bosses to stay employed.

        "House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes denied on Monday morning that there was any evidence from the intelligence community of contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russian operatives. \u201cAs of right now, I don\u2019t have any evidence of any phone calls. It doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t exist. . . . What I\u2019ve been told by many folks is that there\u2019s nothing there,\u201d Nunes ( .) said. Nunes contended there was no need at this time for a special prosecutor to investigate allegations of contact between Russian officials and Trump campaign aides.",
        "House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes ( .) faced some very tough questions from reporters Monday. Nunes was holding a news conference amid reports that the White House had enlisted him \u2014 the man in charge of investigating alleged contacts between the Trump administration and Russia \u2014 to talk to a reporter about the matter. So Nunes was already under fire for making it look as though he isn\u2019t entirely neutral in all of this.",
        "LOS ANGELES \u2014 At the climactic final moment of the 89th Academy Awards, when Faye Dunaway read the name of the film printed on the card in front of her \u2014 \u201cLa La Land!\u201d \u2014 there were two people, standing on either side of the stage in the Dolby Theater, who knew immediately that the film she had just announced did not actually win the Oscar for best picture.

        "Donald Trump may have been a couple thousand miles away, but the newly elected president cast a long shadow over Sunday night\u2019s Oscars ceremony. After a rocky six weeks in the White House marked by divisive attacks, gushing leaks and nationwide protests, the president and his controversial policies seemed to be on the tip of many Hollywood stars\u2019 tongues last night \u2014 which made it even stranger that only one person during the awards show used the word \u201cTrump\u201d in a sentence.",

Monday. \u201cI have to know. \u201d Dunaway, resplendent in white, answered darkly: \u201cWarren is right, is all I\u2019ll tell you. \u201d There had been an envelope, and Warren Beatty opened it, and inside was a card, and the card said \u201cLa La Land,\u201d and so Dunaway did, too.

        "It has long been said \u2014 though perhaps never by Abraham Lincoln \u2014 that \u201cyou can fool some of the people all of the time. \u201d Now, thanks to the wonders of modern social science, we can quantify this aphorism: You can fool 37 percent of the people 100 percent of the time.

        "\u201cManiacal\u201d is not a word you care to hear about the president of the United States, especially not from his close adviser. Previously, \u201cmaniacal\u201d was reserved for the Joker, Doctor Doom, Dr. No, Lex Luthor and the boy F\u00fchrer of North Korea, but there it was, uttered by Stephen K. Bannon to the conservatives congregated in Washington \u2014 \u201cmaniacally focused\u201d \u2014 which tells you why Mr. Bannon is not allowed out very often: He would scare the bejabbers out of the good Republican voters in the Midwest.",
        "Sean Spicer, who is already the subject of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d parodies and has become infamous for his rants, verbal pratfalls and spin, seems to be heading for the distinction of worst press secretary in the history of Western civilization. Consider the following three recent events: First, Spicer has been caught lying or at least operating out of the loop on the decision by the nominee for Navy secretary, Philip Bilden, to back out. The Post reports: There was real consternation behind the scenes, and Bilden was wavering.",
        "The race for chair of the Democratic National Committee was cast as a contest between the more centrist establishment and the left. Yet even though the left\u2019s preferred candidate, Rep. Keith Ellison ( .) lost, the winner was no moderate. Tom Perez had a solidly progressive record serving in the Obama White House as head of the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division and secretary of labor. Yes, Perez supported the Partnership and is friendlier to financial interests than Ellison, but he will still easily be the most progressive DNC chair in years.",
        "Henry Waxman is chairman of Waxman Strategies, a public affairs and strategic communications firm. He served as a Democrat in the House of Representatives from 1975 to 2015.

        "Court documents filed Monday allege that five auto companies were aware of defects that caused Takata air bags to potentially harm or kill motorists but continued to use them to save on costs. The documents filed by lawyers representing victims and their families claim that Honda, Ford, BMW, Toyota and Nissan have known about the issues with the Japanese manufacturer\u2019s air bags for more than a decade but used the air bags anyway because Takata was cheaper than its competitors and could produce the bulk quantities the automakers needed, according to the court documents.",
        "For the most part, the results of the new NBC Street Journal national poll are in line with other recent surveys. President Trump, the pollsters found, is underwater in his approval rating \u2014 meaning that more people disapprove of the job he\u2019s doing than approve. This makes him \u201cthe first president of the War II era with a net negative approval rating in his first gauge of public opinion,\u201d in the words of the Journal\u2019s Michael Bender. Other recent polls have found the same thing, with the split largely falling along partisan lines.",
        "President Trump\u2019s team got into another fight with the New York Times over the weekend. Trump attacked the newspaper again Sunday, apparently after learning that it was running an ad during the Oscars.

        "ISTANBUL \u2014 There is no trace of James Baldwin in the building where he lived for a time, decades ago, on Ebe Hanim street, and where the mention of his name now draws blank stares. The bar where Baldwin drank up the hill from the apartment has vanished, too, lost in the garish renovation of the old Park Hotel.

        "Billionaire Warren Buffett has some wise words for investors: Stop throwing money away on bad advice. In his annual letter to shareholders released over the weekend, the Berkshire Hathaway chief executive bashed active fund managers who charge higher fees on the promise that they can do better than the broader market. Buffett said most savers would be better off putting their money in index funds over the long term, and he estimated that investors wasted roughly $100 billion over the past decade on unnecessary fees.",
        "Look out, Easter Bunny. You may be next. President Trump hasn t embraced many of Washington s traditions. No Alfalfa Club dinner; no White House Correspondents Association Dinner; no active first lady; no visits to D. C. schools, businesses or restaurants (except the one in his hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue); no trips to Camp David; and very few weekends even spent in Washington.

Destination: the ocean. \u201cWe have seen a lot of water before \u2014 in rivers,\u201d they told photographer Martin Bogren. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve seen eternity in the sense of the desert. \u201d But they had only dreamed of the impossible vastness of the ocean.",
        "President Trump on Tuesday said he is open to an immigration reform bill that could provide a pathway to legal status \u2014 but not citizenship \u2014 for potentially millions of people who are in the United States illegally but have not committed serious crimes. At a private White House luncheon with television news anchors, Trump signaled an openness to a dramatic compromise that would represent a softening from the crackdown on all undocumented immigrants that he promised during his campaign and that his more supporters have long advocated."
