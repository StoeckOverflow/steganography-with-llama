        "Barring any last minute changes, President Trump will sign a revised travel ban that exempts current visa holders, according to a person familiar with the matter. The revision marks a significant departure from the first executive order, which temporarily barred refugees and citizens of seven countries from entering the United States, and resulted in the State Department unilaterally revoking tens of thousands of visas. Justice Department lawyers hope the new order will be more likely to withstand legal challenges and will not leave any travelers detained at U. S. airports.",
        "President Trump is coming to Capitol Hill on Tuesday night to address the nation \u2014 and, perhaps more important, his fellow Republicans in Congress who stand divided on key aspects of his legislative agenda. On health care, tax reform and federal spending, GOP lawmakers hold differences of opinion that are obstructing passage of ambitious Republican policies, and so far Trump has shown little desire to referee those disputes openly. The discord was on display Tuesday as Trump prepared to deliver his first speech as president to a joint session of Congress.",
        "President Trump will have to deploy \u201cextraordinary\u201d measures in two weeks to avoid a default on the debt if Congress does not move to raise the federal borrowing cap, a deadline that could expedite his showdown with Congress over taxes and spending. Trump has proposed giant cuts to tax rates for businesses and individuals, as well as new spending on infrastructure and military programs. His advisers have said those changes will boost the economy, creating more money for government spending. \u201cThe money is going to come from a economy,\u201d he said Tuesday morning on Fox News.",
        "VANCOUVER, B. C. \u2014 Kerry Jang, a council member in this picturesque Canadian city, recalls being in the crowd nearly four years ago to welcome Donald Trump to announce plans for a striking new skyscraper that would bring a luxurious hotel and condo development to the heart of downtown. He still keeps the Trump umbrella, a memento handed out at the ceremony, in the trunk of his car. But when Trump\u2019s adult sons appeared Tuesday for a lavish grand opening to fete the gleaming tower, Jang was not part of the festivities.",
        "President Trump and his aides despise and condemn anonymous leaks to reporters. Except, of course, when they are the ones doing the leaking. On the \u201cFox & Friends\u201d program Tuesday on Fox News, the president blamed former president Barack Obama (& friends) for recent leaks, which Trump called \u201creally serious because they are very bad in terms of national security. \u201d He has sicced the Justice Department on leakers. And his press secretary confiscated his staff\u2019s phones in an emergency crackdown. Sounds serious, doesn\u2019t it? But just offstage, quite the contrary.",
        "It\u2019s the photo that\u2019s getting all the attention: Kellyanne Conway, senior adviser to President Trump, sitting with her feet up on a couch in the Oval Office on Monday, reviewing photos on her phone in comfort as a crowd of people join the president for a photo behind his desk. Most people who see that won\u2019t know who those people are or what they\u2019re doing there.",
        "Many advocates of historically black colleges and universities were apoplectic after Education Secretary Betsy DeVos called the group of schools forged at the height of racial segregation \u201cpioneers\u201d of \u201cschool choice. \u201d DeVos issued a statement Monday evening after a meeting with HBCU leaders, praising their schools for identifying \u201ca system that wasn\u2019t working\u201d and taking it \u201cupon themselves to provide the solution\u201d from the outset of their founding.",
        "Those who don\u2019t learn history are doomed to become head of the Education Department, I guess. Here is Betsy DeVos\u2019s actual news release about meeting with presidents of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, in which she praised them as \u201cpioneers when it comes to school choice. \u201d \u201cWait, school choice?\u201d you may well be asking yourself. \u201cDoes she mean choice in the sense that, if these institutions had not been pioneers during the era of racial segregation, black students would have had the choice to go to school or go nowhere?",
        "Like the proverbial canaries in the coal mine, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and national security adviser H. R. McMaster are expected to be early alarms in the event that life in the Trump administration becomes untenable. If the White House fails to build an atmosphere in which they can work, Mattis and McMaster \u2014 both of whom are keenly aware that the world is watching their every move \u2014 could take their leave. The shock waves caused by their departure would be felt throughout the White House, Congress, and foreign capitals around the globe.",
        "Max Stier is president and chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service. Donald Trump campaigned for the presidency as a billionaire businessman who would bring expertise to Washington. But as he quickly discovered, it is much harder running the federal government than a family enterprise. The White House got off to a rocky start during its first weeks, appearing disorganized and in turmoil at times. Every new administration has encountered speed bumps and made mistakes, having never faced the enormous task of managing such a large, complicated enterprise as the federal government.",
        "Any day now, President Trump is going to issue a new version of his travel ban \u2014 one designed to get around the courts, which blocked his last one. Which will renew attention to the question: what is the real motive behind his ban? In a new interview, one of the chief architects of that ban has offered an expanded rationale for it that goes well beyond the original one.",
        "When we talk about \u201ctelevision,\u201d we\u2019re increasingly unlikely to mean the actual objects mounted to our walls or sitting on top of our consoles; instead, we mean the or visual stories we watch on those devices, our computers, or our phones and tablets. But what we use to watch those stories matters, especially since new data suggests that even as television gets grander, some Americans are moving towards smaller screens. According to new data from the U. S. Energy Information Administration, between 2009 and 2015, the number of American households without a single television doubled, from 1.",
        "If the Trump administration proposes a budget that increases defense spending while drastically cutting funding for the State Department and foreign assistance, Congress will reject it and ensure that American soft power continues to be a national security priority, according to Sen. Lindsey O. Graham ( . C.) the chairman of the Senate appropriations state and foreign operations subcommittee. \u201cIt\u2019s dead on arrival, it\u2019s not going to happen, it would be a disaster,\u201d Graham said Tuesday. \u201cThis budget destroys soft power, it puts our diplomats at risk and it\u2019s going nowhere.",
        "Authorities are now investigating a shooting in Kansas that killed one Indian man and wounded another as a hate crime, the FBI said Tuesday. The shooting last week sparked unease in Kansas and across the globe, after witnesses said that the accused gunman had told the two men to \u201cget out of my country\u201d before opening fire. While President Trump has been criticized for not speaking out on the shooting in Olathe, Kan. following the FBI\u2019s announcement Tuesday, the White House called the attack \u201can act of racially motivated hatred.",
        "GENEVA \u2014 The vacuum in U. S. policy on Syria is being keenly felt at the latest round of peace talks aimed at negotiating a political solution to the Syrian war \u2014 talks that seem destined to wind down this week without meaningful progress. Five days into a round of discussions intended to take place between delegations representing the Syrian government and the opposition, government and opposition negotiators still have not met.",
        "Residents in Flint, Mich. are about to start paying the full cost of their water again, even though what\u2019s flowing from their taps has yet to be declared safe to drink without an approved filter. On Wednesday, state officials will end a program that has helped pay residents\u2019 bills since a series of decisions by emergency managers left the city\u2019s water system contaminated with lead. Since that 2014 disaster, the state has spent roughly $41 million in credits to help offset local utility bills.",
        "BEIJING \u2014 For China\u2019s Communist Party, it\u2019s hard to know whether to laugh or cry. Hardly a day goes by without some opinion piece in state media here reveling in the demise of democracy and American global leadership under President Trump. But underneath the triumphalism, China\u2019s government is deeply anxious, experts say, as it faces a government packed with hawkish voices led by man who sees Beijing as one of the United States\u2019 fiercest competitors.",
        "Shares of the parent company of Sterling Jewelers, which owns Jared the Galleria of Jewelry and Kay Jewelers, plunged nearly 13 percent Tuesday and briefly halted trading, after The Washington Post reported that hundreds of former workers had made claims of widespread sexual harassment and discrimination at the company. About 250 former employees allege in sworn statements that women were routinely groped, demeaned and urged to sexually cater to their bosses to remain employed. A separate memorandum, made public in 2013, specifically names the chief executive as a participant in the sexual impropriety.",
        "The U. S. Air Force, faced with a potentially protracted war against the Islamic State, aging fighter jets and a shrinking force of pilots, is examining the adoption of a new fleet of \u201c \u201d planes that are both a throwback to earlier U. S. operations and a current staple of militaries in South America and the Middle East. The aircraft would be able to carry out airstrikes against the Islamic State and other militants for less money than the Fighting Falcon or the Super Hornet.",
        "Rates of colon and rectal cancer are rising sharply among young and Americans, at the same time that they continue to decline for adults 55 and older, according to a startling new study that is sparking questions about whether screening should start earlier. The study, published Tuesday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, found that between the and 2013, colon cancer rates increased about 1 to 2 percent per year for people in their 20s and 30s. Rates for adults also rose, but at a slower pace.",
        "The Office of Management and Budget has suggested deep cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s budget that would reduce its staff by in the first year and eliminate dozens of programs, according to details of a document reviewed by The Washington Post. While White House officials have already indicated that they plan to increase defense spending at the expense of other discretionary funding, the new document spells out exactly how this new approach will affect federal programs that have a direct impact on Americans\u2019 everyday lives.",
        "NAIROBI \u2014 President Trump has proposed large cuts to foreign aid at a time of acute need across Africa and the Middle East, with four countries approaching famine and 20 million people nearing starvation, according to the United Nations. It is the first time in recent memory that so many hunger crises have occurred simultaneously, and humanitarian groups say they do not have the resources to respond effectively. The United Nations has requested $4. 4 billion by March to \u201cavert a catastrophe,\u201d Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said last week.",
        "President Trump ascended the bulliest of pulpits Tuesday to address a joint session of Congress. It turns out it was his fellow Republicans who needed some bullying \u2014 specifically, on their plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The leader of the Republican Party took some tentative steps in his address to the joint congressional session toward a position in the Obamacare fight currently looming over Capitol Hill. But the president\u2019s words sparked as much debate as they quashed.",
        "The White House Counsel\u2019s Office has concluded that senior adviser Kellyanne Conway acted \u201cinadvertently\u201d when she endorsed Ivanka Trump\u2019s clothing line, rebuffing a recommendation by the top federal ethics official that she be disciplined for an apparent violation of federal rules. Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as deputy counsel to President Trump, wrote in a letter Tuesday that his office concluded Conway was speaking in a \u201clight, offhand manner\u201d when she touted the Ivanka Trump line during a Feb. 9 appearance on \u201cFox & Friends.",
        "President Trump\u2019s speech to the nation on Tuesday night will likely be remembered for a single moment in the months and years to come \u2014 the moment he led a standing ovation for the widow of a Navy SEAL who died during a raid in Yemen. But whether that moment will ultimately be remembered as a good turning point for Trump or a bad one is very much an open question. The fact is that, while the moment was touching and earned plaudits from even liberal commentators, it belies a troubling set of circumstances for the Trump administration.",
        "CNN\u2019s Van Jones is a frequent Trump critic if there ever was one. But after the president\u2019s speech to the nation on Tuesday night, Jones got emotional and was clearly impressed by Trump\u2019s handling of one particular part of the speech. Jones said Trump\u2019s tribute to Navy SEAL Ryan Owens, who died in a raid in Yemen, was \u201cone of the most extraordinary moments you have ever seen in American politics, period\u201d and that it was the moment Trump \u201cbecame president of the United States.",
        "An address to Congress is such an important speech that presidents generally are careful not to stretch the truth. The \u201c16 words\u201d in George W. Bush\u2019s 2003 State of the Union address that falsely claimed Iraq\u2019s Saddam Hussein sought uranium from Africa led to significant turmoil in the administration, including the criminal conviction of a top aide. President Trump\u2019s maiden address to Congress was notable because it was filled with numerous inaccuracies. In fact, many of the president\u2019s false claims are old favorites that he trots out on a regular, almost daily basis.",
        "The obsession with President Trump\u2019s ability to spend one hour in a disciplined relationship with a teleprompter obscured one of his central goals on Tuesday night: He continued to try to scare the country to death. Yes, he lived up to media expectations that he would finally attempt to look \u201cpresidential\u201d and that he could recite words that sounded optimistic and . He and his handlers are well aware that commentators typically reward presidents for doing what commentators say presidents need to do.",
        "Mich\u00e8le Flournoy, chief executive of the Center for a New American Security, was undersecretary of defense for policy from 2009 to 2012. In his address Tuesday to Congress, President Trump promised to make sure that the U. S. military gets what it needs to carry out its mission by securing \u201cone of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. \u201d More funding would surely be a good thing, although the issues of how much and what for are complicated.",
        "Only the willfully blind saw anything except a powerfully delivered address by President Trump to Congress on Tuesday night. Many have praised his tone. Almost all conservative critics applauded most of his substance (with disquiet over his rhetoric on trade passing quickly over House Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s face and the hearts of most Reagan conservatives). With the pledges of significant funding for the military, and the detailed takedown of the \u201ccollapsing\u201d Obamacare and the false promises made to secure its passage in the first place (\u201cIf you like your doctor . . ."
