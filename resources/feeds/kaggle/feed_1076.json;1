        "PARIS \u2014 On Thursday, the European Parliament voted to lift Marine Le Pen\u2019s immunity from prosecution for tweeting violent images, a crime that in France can carry up to three years in prison. As Le Pen, the leader of France\u2019s National Front party, rises in the polls ahead of France\u2019s presidential election next month, authorities will now be able to pursue a case against her. Speaking on French television Thursday morning, she was quick to condemn her European colleagues for what she called \u201ca political inquiry.",
        "It\u2019s not uncommon these days to see images of celebrities, artists and other famous people posing for their friends on social media. Whether they are showing off their latest lipstick, snuggling with a puppy or announcing their pregnancy, Snapchat and Instagram are brimming with images of the cultural elite of our time. While the technology may be new, the phenomenon is not. Decades before the invention of the smartphone, if you were a socialite in Paris in the late 1920s, the person to pose for was Berenice Abbott.",
        "In the most abstract sense, there is nothing noteworthy about a government official meeting with an ambassador from a foreign country. When such an interaction becomes important is when that official is an ally of a presidential campaign that\u2019s got a complex set of possibly inappropriate relationships with other representatives of that ambassador\u2019s country \u2014 and when that official while under oath says he did not have communications with representatives of that country. What we\u2019re going to endeavor to do here is to parse out that complex set of relationships, using the information we have at hand.",
        "A major split among senior White House officials over whether to effectively create a new tax on imported goods has stalled the broader tax overhaul effort on Capitol Hill, with Republicans looking to the Trump administration for leadership on an issue that has drawn fierce resistance, according to several officials with direct knowledge of the matter. White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, senior adviser Stephen Miller and National Trade Council director Peter Navarro have all voiced internal support for the creation of a border adjustment tax or something like it.",
        "Uber, the service that has become one of the tech industry\u2019s most emulated companies, has smashed into a painful wall of reality in recent weeks, capped by a report Friday that the company has taken extraordinary measures to evade government officials in places where the service was restricted or banned. The revelation, which Uber did not dispute in a statement, follows allegations of sexual harassment, questions about customer privacy and a \u201c#deleteUber\u201d campaign on Twitter, sparked by accusations that the company was not respecting a driver strike at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City in January.",
        "MEXICO CITY \u2014 The deportees stepped off their flight from El Paso looking bewildered \u2014 135 men who had left families and jobs behind after being swept up in the Trump administration\u2019s mounting effort to send millions of undocumented immigrants back to their economically fraught homeland. As they filed into Mexico City International Airport last week, government employees handed them free sandwiches, Mexican ID cards and information directing them to social services in the capital. \u201cWelcome back!\u201d a cheerful government worker called out, taking down names and phone numbers.",
        "The families of U. S. service members who have died while serving their country are split on how they see President Trump\u2019s recognition of a recent military widow at his first joint address to Congress, but they almost universally support her decision to accept Trump\u2019s invitation to attend in the Capitol. The moment was the emotional apex of Trump\u2019s speech Tuesday night, in which he said Senior Chief William \u201cRyan\u201d Owens, a member of the elite SEAL Team 6, \u201cdied as he lived \u2014 a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation.",
        "Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is pushing back against the White House\u2019s proposal to drastically slash funding for diplomacy and development, a sign he intends to fight for his department\u2019s mission inside the Trump administration. Tillerson\u2019s formal appeal of the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s initial budget proposal seeks to restore some of the huge cuts proposed by the White House for State Department and foreign assistance funding, according to an internal State Department memo I obtained.",
        "Having trouble following the developments about the Trump team\u2019s ties to Russia? Here\u2019s a primer to get you up to speed: President Trump got to know Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201cvery well,\u201d but he doesn\u2019t \u201cknow Putin. \u201d Putin sent Trump \u201ca present\u201d and they spoke, but Trump has \u201cno relationship with him. \u201d Trump has \u201cnothing to do with Russia,\u201d but his son has said \u201cRussians make up a pretty disproportionate of a lot of our assets\u201d and \u201cwe see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.",
        "I have some disturbing news to share: Republicans might not be as deeply committed to proper email management as you\u2019ve been led to believe. During the campaign, the entire Republican Party argued that despite Hillary Clinton\u2019s copious qualifications for the presidency, it would be unconscionably dangerous to let her anywhere near the Oval Office because she had used a private email account while she was secretary of state. Crowds at Republican events would chant \u201cLock her up!\u201d whenever Clinton\u2019s name was mentioned. In one debate, Donald Trump said to Clinton that if he were president, \u201cYou\u2019d be in jail.",
        "The issues under debate in this year\u2019s French presidential election are broad and varied: terrorism and trade, the retirement age and social security, the legacy of France in Algeria and the future of France in Europe. But in truth, only one issue really matters: Can the heady cocktail of nationalism, nostalgia, resentment, foreign policy and economics \u2014 a philosophy that is described, unsatisfyingly, as \u201cfar right\u201d or \u201cpopulist,\u201d that takes a particularly virulent online form and that has contributed to recent electoral victories in the United States and Britain \u2014 be defeated in a major Western country?",
        "The Post reports: The House plan calls for a refundable tax credit to help Americans afford insurance premiums, but conservatives in the House and the Senate think it amounts to an expensive new federal entitlement. . . . Conservative Republicans have long opposed refundable tax credits because Americans with lower incomes, who pay less in taxes, receive the full credit even if it exceeds their tax bill. Nonrefundable credits can be used only to offset actual tax liability \u2014 but would also mean less money in the pockets of Americans who need help paying for health insurance.",
        "The Environmental Protection Agency plans to announce its intent to withdraw final determination on strict standards for future cars and light trucks, the latest signal by the Trump administration that it is charting a new course on climate change. Two associations representing the world\u2019s biggest automakers last week asked EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to reconsider the standards for model years 2022 to 2025, which would require the nation\u2019s car and fleet to average 54. 5 miles per gallon by the end of that period.",
        "Federal Reserve chair Janet L. Yellen said a March rate hike would be \u201cappropriate\u201d if the economy continues to evolve as expected, signaling that the central bank will likely raise its benchmark interest rate sooner than many economists and investors had expected just a few weeks ago. Until as recently as last week, Wall Street saw a rate hike as likelier in June. But in remarks made to the Executives Club of Chicago on Friday, Yellen cited a strong job market and rising inflation.",
        "Having apparently temporarily misplaced his Android phone after his joint address to Congress, President Trump has relocated it (probably on the nightstand in the Lincoln bedroom) and has resumed his habit of angry early morning tweeting about his political opponents. On Friday morning, his target was Democrats on Capitol Hill who he said are still blocking his Cabinet picks from being approved. It is so pathetic that the Dems have still not approved my full Cabinet. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2017 It\u2019s hard to overstate what nonsense this is.",
        "Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who during his confirmation hearings repeatedly vowed to promote human rights as a core American value, alarmed human rights advocates when he did not appear in person to present the State Department s annual human rights report, released Friday. In a break with tradition only rarely breached, Tillerson s remarks were limited to a short written introduction to the lengthy report. Nor did any senior State Department official make comments that are typically watched around the world, including by officials in authoritarian countries where abuses are singled out in the report.",
        "A former journalist allegedly carried out at least some of the recent bomb threats against Jewish institutions across the country, according to the FBI, which described the menacing calls as part of the man\u2019s campaign to harass a woman. Law enforcement officials said Friday that they do not believe the man they arrested \u2014 Juan Thompson, 31 \u2014 is responsible for all of the calls to scores of Jewish centers and schools in recent months, nor do they think he was behind the vandalism of headstones at Jewish cemeteries in Missouri, Pennsylvania and, most recently, upstate New York.",
        "Arnold Schwarzenegger announced Friday that he will not be returning for another season of \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d \u2014 and he blamed President Trump for the show\u2019s dwindling ratings. Schwarzenegger informed NBC of his decision Friday and confirmed the news in a statement sent by his representative to The Washington Post: \u201cI loved every second of working with NBC and Mark Burnett,\u201d Mr. Schwarzenegger said, referring to the creator of \u201cThe Apprentice.",
        "The European Parliament has drawn a tough line with Washington in a dispute over travel, demanding that the United States extend the privileged status to all 28 European Union nations or risk having it pulled for Americans visiting Europe. The vote Thursday by E. U. lawmakers \u2014 calling to end the visa waiver for Americans \u2014 was seen as mostly an stunt ahead of a June 15 meeting between European and American envoys. But it also runs up against tighter policies by the Trump administration and could leave Europe in a political bind if Washington refuses to bend.",
        "In the first episode of \u201cThe Arrangement,\u201d aspiring actress Megan Morrison (Christine Evangelista) is asked to settle a bet between two young businessmen dining at the restaurant where she waits tables. One is convinced that he\u2019s seen her in something, but his douchey buddy won\u2019t pay up until she delivers a line from one of her past roles. \u201cThat is a risk I\u2019m willing to take, Lieutenant, because last I checked all citizens are entitled to legal counsel,\u201d Megan says. \u201cEven vampires.",
        "Syrian teenagers play on the beach near Soli district. Syrians and Turks live separately in Mersin, which is one of the biggest Syrian populated cities in Turkey. (EMIN LEJOURNAL) For the past four years, photographer Emin Ozmen has been documenting the plight of Syrian refugees living in Turkey. According to the United Nations refugee agency, there are more than 2, 8 million registered Syrian refugees in Turkey. And more than half of them are children.",
        "President Trump on Saturday angrily accused former president Barack Obama of orchestrating a \u201c \u201d plot to tap the phones at his Trump Tower headquarters last fall in the to the election. While citing no evidence to support his explosive allegation, Trump said in a series of four tweets sent Saturday morning that Obama was \u201cwire tapping\u201d his New York offices before the election in a move he compared to McCarthyism. \u201cBad (or sick) guy!\u201d he said of his predecessor, adding that the surveillance resulted in \u201cnothing found.",
        "Russia has become the slow burn of President Trump\u2019s administration. It is the issue that he and his team cannot get beyond. They cannot get beyond it because they are skittish about accepting what is already known. They cannot get beyond it because they have not been as forthcoming as they could be about what they did. They cannot get beyond it because they don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know. It\u2019s important to remember that much isn\u2019t yet known about the whole controversy, particularly the contacts between Trump campaign officials or advisers and the Russians.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s adult sons, who are overseeing a nationwide expansion of the family business during their father\u2019s presidency, are envisioning ways that their experiences from the campaign trail can help them establish a footing in dozens of new markets. The idea is to move beyond a focus on luxury hotels in big metropolises and build boutique properties in a broader mix of cities, including some the Trump brothers came to know well during more than a year of intensive travel, fundraising and networking on the road to the White House.",
        "MANILA \u2014 A world of sin. A weary savior. Filipinos know the story well. Since coming to power last summer, President Rodrigo Duterte has used biblical language to build a case for mass killings, vowing to sacrifice himself, even his son, to cleanse the nation of crime. Conjuring a world in which evil stalks the innocent, Duterte launched a wave of violence that has claimed at least 7, 000 lives. With his critics cursed and shamed, and with public support for the president running high, the establishment, including the Roman Catholic Church, has for the most part stayed quiet.",
        "A Pentagon plan for the coming assault on Raqqa, the Islamic State capital in Syria, calls for significant U. S. military participation, including increased Special Operations forces, attack helicopters and artillery, and arms supplies to the main Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighting force on the ground, according to U. S. officials. The military\u2019s favored option among several variations currently under White House review, the proposal would ease a number of restrictions on U. S. activities imposed during the Obama administration. Officials involved in the planning have proposed lifting a cap on the size of the U. S.",
        "The easiest sell of President Trump\u2019s life is that a \u201ccorrupt\u201d media produces \u201cfake news. \u201d After all, fewer than 2 in 10 Americans have \u201ca lot\u201d of trust in news organizations, the Pew Research Center has found, and we live in a \u201cMatrix\u201d \u201cconspiracy culture,\u201d according to social scientists, where one is thought to be impossibly simple to not understand that the world is ruled by collusion and machination. Trump has helped make trust a big deal for media types, and they are now searching for ways to regain the faith of their readers.",
        "Ruy Teixeira\u2019s new book is \u201cThe Optimistic Leftist: Why the 21st Century Will Be Better Than You Think. \u201d Is Donald Trump the end for the left? Is it really possible, as a baby boomer averred in an interview last month with The Washington Post, that \u201call the things we cared about for the past 40 years could be wiped out in the first 100 days\u201d? American leftists are not known for their optimism, and yet, even for them, the prevailing sentiment is that these are especially dark days.",
        "Ayn Rand is dead. It\u2019s been 35 years since hundreds of mourners filed by her coffin (fittingly accompanied by a flower arrangement) but it has been only four months since she truly died as a force in American politics. Yes, there was a flurry of articles identifying Rand lovers in the Trump administration, including Rex Tillerson and Mike Pompeo; yes, Ivanka Trump tweeted an inaccurate Rand quote in . But the effort to fix a recognizable ideology on President Trump only obscures the more significant trends that the election of 2016 laid bare.",
        "In 2008, the George W. Bush administration, which had started building about 670 miles of border fencing on mostly federally owned land in Arizona, California and New Mexico under the Secure Fence Act of 2006, tried to seize an acre or so in Cameron County, Tex. that belonged to Eloisa Tamez. Things did not go quickly. Tamez fought the government in federal court. During seven years of litigation and negotiation, she became famous for resisting the border fence."
