        "Montgomery County Executive Isiah Leggett announced this past week that a controversial statue commemorating the Confederacy has been sold and will be moved off public property in Rockville, Md. The news capped almost two years of debate that began after Dylann Roof murdered nine people in a historic African American church in Charleston, S. C. in 2015. Montgomery County was one of many jurisdictions wrestling, in the wake of Roof\u2019s crime, with what to do with symbols celebrating the Confederacy: South Carolina removed the Confederate flag from its statehouse, Yale scrubbed the name of segregationist John C.",
        "When Education Secretary Betsy DeVos cast historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) as \u201cpioneers\u201d in \u201cschool choice\u201d this past week, her critics scoffed at the notion that black students could choose to matriculate wherever they wished during the days of segregation. In a series of tweets, DeVos attempted to adjust her statement, focusing instead on the schools\u2019 birth from necessity. But the episode revealed just how many misconceptions persist about the nation\u2019s more than 100 HBCUs. Myth No. 1 Black colleges were founded by black people.",
        "Paul Corby needs a new heart. On that there is no dispute. The same rare disease that killed his father at 27 is destroying his left ventricle. While there is no cure or surgery that might repair the damage, a heart transplant could extend his life considerably. But Corby, who lives in Pottsville, Pa. is autistic, suffers from several psychological conditions and takes 19 medications. When he applied to the transplant program at the University of Pennsylvania in 2011, he was rejected because of his \u201cpsychiatric issues, autism, the complexity of the process . . .",
        "Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao this past week raised the prospect that needed infrastructure improvements may be funded to some extent by imposing tolls on more of the nation\u2019s roads and bridges. It was unclear whether she intends to expand tolling on the U. S. interstate system. The concept of granting massive tax credits to lure private infrastructure investment was the centerpiece of President Trump\u2019s campaign promise to raise $1 trillion for roads and bridges.",
        "Between 1925 and the 1960s, in a tiny town called Tuam in western Ireland\u2019s County Galway, thousands of \u201cfallen women\u201d and their \u201cillegitimate\u201d children passed through the Mother and Baby Home operated by the Congregation of the Sisters of Bon Secours. After a period of involuntary service and penance, many of the women who came to the home left to resume their lives, as The Post\u2019s Terrence McCoy reported in 2014. But some of the children did not leave. And what became of them remained a mystery into which few cared to inquire.",
        "The Sikh man was working on his car in his driveway in Kent, Wash. just south of Seattle, when a man walked up wearing a mask and holding a gun. According to a report in the Seattle Times, there was an altercation, and the gunman \u2014 a stocky, white man wearing a mask over the bottom part of his face \u2014 said \u201cGo back to your own country\u201d and pulled the trigger.

        "A line from President Trump\u2019s speech last Tuesday to the joint session of Congress came back to haunt him on social media Saturday morning: \u201cThe time for trivial fights is behind us. \u201d Apparently, in Trump\u2019s view, feuds regarding his old reality show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d don\u2019t qualify as trivial. On Friday the show\u2019s new host, Arnold Schwarzenegger, released a statement saying he would not return for a second season. \u201cI loved every second of working with NBC and Mark Burnett.",
        "Bill Maher started out the interview by calling Jeffrey Lord one of \u201cthe nicest guys in the world. Genteel. Polite. \u201d Minutes later, Maher was cursing at the Trump CNN contributor. Their Friday conversation on \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher\u201d intensified, then boiled over as they talked about whether alleged Russian vote manipulation helped make Trump president. \u201cUnless you can manipulate the votes in the machine, you haven\u2019t done it,\u201d Lord told Maher. \u201cI like you, and I heard you\u2019re a very nice guy, but don\u2019t bull \u2014 me,\u201d Maher replied.",
        "I guess I\u2019m giving up silence for Lent this year. That\u2019s an odd thing to say when you make a living yapping about sports on ESPN. And odder when the show I host, \u201cAround the Horn,\u201d makes a game out of LOUD NOISES. (That is to say, loud, perspicacious noises from the most insightful sportswriters in America!) I press a mute button to shut them down if (when!) our sports debate careens out of bounds (Fake News! ). Silence is how I penalize. Silence works. But is silence good?",
        "I just returned from skiing in Steamboat Springs, Colo. after more than a decade. At the age of 59, I wondered whether I might be too old to ski, or at least ski the way I did when I was younger. It turns out I was fine, but older people have a lot to consider before downhill skiing. And not all of it bad. About 18 percent of skiers in 2016 were over the age of 55, according to Michael Berry, president of the National Ski Areas Association, up from 17 percent in the previous year.",
        "Remember when restaurant wine selections were limited to \u201cred, white and pink\u201d? If you were born in the 1950s, you probably do. Then we became a nation that craved variety, and restaurants responded by offering more wines by the glass. It was a great way to try something new without committing to an entire bottle. We could drink something interesting with our appetizers before enjoying a bottle with the entrees, or improvise a flight of different wines to match dishes throughout the meal. Of course, we kvetched about the cost. Twenty dollars or more for a glass of wine?",
        "FBI Director James B. Comey asked the Justice Department this weekend to issue a statement refuting President Trump\u2019s claim that President Barack Obama ordered a wiretap of Trump\u2019s phones before the election, according to U. S. officials, but the department did not do so. Comey made the request on Saturday after Trump accused Obama on Twitter of having his \u201c\u2018wires tapped\u2019 in Trump Tower. \u201d The White House expanded on Trump\u2019s comments Sunday with a call for a congressional probe of his allegations.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has veered onto a road with no centerlines or guardrails. The president\u2019s accusation Saturday that his predecessor, Barack Obama, had tapped his phone \u201cduring the very sacred election process\u201d escalated on Sunday into the White House\u2019s call for a congressional investigation of that claim. The audacious tactic was a familiar one for Trump, who has little regard for norms and conventions. When he wants to change a subject, he often does it by touching a match to the dry tinder of a sketchy conspiracy theory.",

        "There\u2019s a fan theory that author and master of horror fiction Stephen King predicted the rise of Donald Trump in his novel about a clairvoyant who foresees a demagogic salesman win the U. S. presidency and start a global war. to the present, in which President Trump, without offering any evidence, accused his predecessor of wiretapping his campaign offices, and King mocked him with a horror story, told in three tweets.

        "Many Americans were appalled when President Trump called the news media \u201cthe enemy of the American people. \u201d And rightly so: It\u2019s a phrase out of the autocrats\u2019 handbook. What got less attention was Trump\u2019s answer to Bill O\u2019Reilly of Fox News, who challenged the president about his admiration for Russian president Vladimir Putin \u2014 given how it\u2019s widely acknowledged that the Russian president has caused the sudden deaths of dissidents and journalists. \u201cHe\u2019s a killer,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said.

        "MOSCOW \u2014 Anyone following the uproar in Washington over allegations of inappropriate ties to Russia within the Trump administration might be interested in Moscow\u2019s reaction to sweeping corruption charges the country\u2019s most recognizable Kremlin opponent has leveled against Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. Crickets, pretty much.
