        "When it comes to travel, Internet access has never been more ubiquitous \u2014 or more underwhelming. Don\u2019t take my word for it. Just ask Wendy Lewis, who says she spends a good part of every trip trying \u2014 and sometimes failing \u2014 to find reliable and reasonably priced hotspots. Airport lounges make connecting a cinch, she says. But the moment she boards a bus, plane or train, it\u2019s a headache, with slow speeds, high bills and frequent outages. \u201cIt\u2019s always a challenge for me and a point of tremendous frustration,\u201d says Lewis, a beauty consultant from New York.",
        "House Republicans on Monday released legislation to supplant the Affordable Care Act with a more conservative vision for the nation\u2019s health care system, replacing federal insurance subsidies with a new form of individual tax credits and grants to help states shape their own policies. Under bills drafted by two House committees, the GOP would no longer penalize Americans for failing to have health insurance and would begin winding down the ACA\u2019s expansion of Medicaid three years from now.",
        "President Trump signed a new travel ban Monday that administration officials said they hope will end legal challenges over the matter by imposing a ban on the issuance of new visas for citizens of six nations. In addition, the nation\u2019s refu gee program will be suspended for 120 days, and the United States will not accept more than 50, 000 refugees in a year, down from the 110, 000 cap set by the Obama administration.",

        "The Supreme Court on Monday put off a major decision on transgender rights, a result of the Trump administration\u2019s decision last month to withdraw federal support of the Virginia high schooler who has waged a legal fight to use the boys\u2019 restroom. The decision to send the case of Gavin Grimm back to a lower court delays until at least next term a decision on whether federal laws that forbid discrimination on the basis of sex also extend to gender identity.",
        "President Trump has no evidence for his incendiary claim that Barack Obama ordered wiretaps on Trump Tower, and denials have come not just from the former president and his director of national intelligence but from Jim Comey \u2014 the man Trump has showered with praise and retained as his FBI director. But Trump has something more powerful to him than any evidence, no matter how compelling: He believes. Firmly. \u201cThe president firmly believes that the Obama administration may have tapped into the phones at Trump Tower,\u201d Trump spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders declared on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show Monday morning.",
        "It would have been impossible to imagine a year ago that the Republican Party\u2019s leaders would be effectively serving as enablers of Russian interference in this country\u2019s political system. Yet, astonishingly, that is the role the Republican Party is playing. U. S. intelligence services have stated that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election with the intention of swinging it to one side. Knowing how cautious the intelligence community is in making such judgments, and given the significance of this particular finding, the evidence must be compelling.",
        "President Trump\u2019s escalation of his inflammatory claims that Obama loyalists are out to get him, culminating in his unfounded weekend that former President Barack Obama wiretapped him, has brought his siege mentality to a new level of . A host of and explainers have poked holes in Trump\u2019s claims, pointing out that they lack any evidence or substantiation. But even as the mainstream media has attempted to the public to reality, another group of people is already showing signs that it may rise to his defense: the religious right.",

Write what\u2019s in your heart,\u201d Peggy Wallace Kennedy told me she told her children when they first walked across the Edmund Pettus Bridge years ago. What fine advice to follow after having walked the span with Rep. John Lewis ( .) over the weekend. The overwhelming experience was part of the Congressional Civil Rights Pilgrimage to Alabama organized by the Faith & Politics Institute.

        "The New York Times\u2019 Nicholas Kristof, responding to Matt Yglesias\u2019s statement that \u201cIt\u2019s impressive that the IRS never leaks,\u201d wrote: But if you\u2019re in IRS and have a certain president\u2019s tax return that you\u2019d like to leak, my address is: NYT, 620 Eighth Ave, NY NY 10018. https: . \u2014 Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) March 6, 2017 The problem is that (1) it\u2019s a felony for someone who works at the Internal Revenue Service to leak a tax return, and (2) soliciting someone to commit a crime is itself a crime.",
        "Here is what Attorney General Jeff Sessions should have said when he stepped up to the podium and addressed reporters last week at the Justice Department: \u201cAt long last, have you left no sense of decency?\u201d Sessions is the victim of the type of McCarthyite character assassination that the left used to condemn. Remember when accusing people without evidence of coordinating with the Kremlin was frowned upon? No longer, apparently. In fact, what Sessions faced may be worse than McCarthyism.",
        "Iranian vessels came dangerously close to a U. S. Navy surveillance ship in the Strait of Hormuz over the weekend, U. S. officials said Monday. The apparent harassment of the USS Invincible on two occasions, on Thursday and Saturday, came amid Iranian state media reports that Iran had tested its newly acquired missile air defense system that is designed to intercept incoming missiles.

        "Ben Carson compared slaves to immigrants seeking a better life in his first official address Monday as Housing and Urban Development Secretary, setting off an uproar on social media. In what appears to be an embarrassing pattern of on race for the Trump administration, Carson told a room packed with hundreds of federal workers that the Africans captured, sold and transported to America against their will had the same hopes and dreams as early immigrants. \u201cThat\u2019s what America is about.

        "President Trump and congressional Republicans are poised to roll back a series of worker safety regulations targeted by business groups, starting with a rule that would require federal contractors to disclose and correct serious safety violations. The Senate is set to vote Monday evening to eliminate the regulation, dubbed the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule. Finalized in August and blocked by a court order in October, the rule would limit the ability of companies with recent safety problems to complete for government contracts unless they agreed to remedies.

Several factions within the Republican Party don\u2019t like some key details about this new plan. In fact, there\u2019s enough opposition that these Republicans could derail the bill as it stands.
