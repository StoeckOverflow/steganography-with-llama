        "Timothy Jost is an emeritus professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law. The American Health Care Act, introduced in the House Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means committees late Monday, was advertised as a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. But the real focus of the legislation is not on reform, not even on repealing the ACA as such. What the AHCA would in fact do is massively redistribute wealth from the poorest Americans to the wealthiest.",
        "We have been hearing more about the Deep State lately. It is about time. I have cherished my admissions letter to DEEP STATE ever since it was flown down my chimney by an old bat with large leathery wings shortly after my 11th birthday. It is below. Congratulations on your admission to DEEP STATE! We\u2019d love to learn more about you as you make up your mind about whether to attend this elite institution and join the many graduates who proudly proclaim our Latin motto, \u201cstatus in statu. \u201d First, a question.",
        "Joe Biden is following me. I go to lunch at Mickey\u2019s Diner and he\u2019s sitting two stools away, wearing a stocking cap and a fake mustache with a fake nose and glasses but he says, \u201cHey, how\u2019s it going, fella?\u201d It\u2019s Joe Biden. So pathetic. Sad. He is conducting a destabilization campaign against me, putting chemicals in my food that make me behave erratically. Why? Because he and his secret cabal are terrified of what I represent. My guiding principle from the beginning has been Make Earth The Center Again. Not the sun. Earth First.",
        "David Kris was assistant attorney general for national security from 2009 to 2011. He served as a national security adviser to the Clinton campaign in 2016. The president\u2019s wiretap tweetstorm on Saturday produced the expected reactions, some of them inaccurate. Here are three points about the legal questions in play and three broader questions about what is really going on. First, the U. S. government needs probable cause, signatures from government officials and advance approval from a federal court before engaging in wiretapping in the United States.",
        "In 2014, on a popular Facebook page called \u201cDoctrine Man,\u201d a serving Army National Guard officer wrote \u201clet the butt hurt begin\u201d in a thread discussing an article about one of us, Paula Broadwell, and, below it, posted a graphic image of a woman\u2019s partially naked body impaled by a pitchfork. (Editor\u2019s note: This link contains a graphic image.) Broadwell had certainly encountered vulgarity and sexism, both subtle and overt, in an ongoing military career that goes all the way back to West Point.",
        "The most famous special prosecutor remains the first one: Archibald Cox of Watergate fame. After Cox got sideways with President Richard Nixon in 1973, the president ordered Cox fired, which led to the \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d and then to Leon Jaworski, and then to . . . well, you remember. Now, though, Democrats are lined up demanding a special prosecutor into Russia\u2019s interference with our election. They may have visions of Cox and Jaworski dancing in their heads, but they should be careful what they wish for.",
        "The head of general surgery at Medical Center had a remarkably simple idea not long ago: What if the department suggested that surgeons limit prescriptions of narcotic pain pills to a specific number for different kinds of operations? The results were dramatic: The number of pills prescribed by doctors for five common outpatient surgeries dropped by 53 percent, and patients didn\u2019t consume all the pills they were given, according to a study that will be published this week in the journal Annals of Surgery.",
        "A new wave of threats were made late Monday and Tuesday to Jewish schools and institutions, including the New York and Washington offices of the League, according to that group and other officials. These latest bomb threats came as a letter signed by every U. S. senator was sent to top law enforcement officials in the Trump administration, asking them to do more in response to the bout of threatening messages that have continuously rattled Jewish groups this year.",
        "White House tours resumed Tuesday after being on hiatus during the presidential transition and inauguration. And within a few short hours, one tour group got just about all the access it could hope for. Ever the showman, President Trump decided to surprise the group, emerging from behind a wooden partition like an emcee taking the stage, to excited screams and applause. He raised his hands \u2014 as if to say \u201cHere I am!\u201d \u2014 and greeted a young boy picked from the crowd.",
        "Khizr Khan, the Gold Star father whose impassioned speech at the Democratic National Convention in July called on Americans to reject a ban on Muslims entering the United States, claimed that his \u201ctravel privileges are being reviewed\u201d by U. S. authorities, forcing him to cancel a scheduled speech in Toronto. The announcement on Monday coincided with President Trump\u2019s rewritten order to temporarily ban entry of citizens from six nations to the United States. Khan has been a U. S. citizen for more than 30 years and was born in Pakistan, which is not one of the six nations.",
        "BEIJING \u2014 China warned Tuesday of \u201cconsequences\u201d for South Korea over the deployment of a U. S. antimissile system, raising regional tension and questions about China\u2019s commitment to free, open trade. The U. S. military began deploying the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system to South Korea on Monday, the same day North Korea launched four missiles that landed off the Japanese coast. The United States and South Korea say the system is a necessary defense against Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime, but Beijing rejects the plan.",
        "For the past decade, poachers have killed rhinoceroses in the wild and in protected reserves around the world at alarming rates, threatening the survival of four of the world\u2019s five rhino species. The poaching is driven by a demand for rhino horns in southeast Asia that has grown nearly insatiable; so much so, experts say, that any living rhino \u2014 anywhere in the world \u2014 is now at risk of being killed.",
        "One in a series on the clothes having a moment at Paris Fashion Week: PARIS \u2014 Karl Lagerfeld is a showman, a provocateur, a man of the age. Whether he is serving up biting opinions about Adele, mischaracterizing Meryl Streep\u2019s relationship with design houses or envisioning the staging of a runway show, the Chanel creative director knows how to capture our attention and set Instagram on fire. The company\u2019s elaborate sets in the Grand Palais have included a Paris bistro, an airport terminal, an art gallery and a grocery store.",
        "A constellation of influential groups representing the nation\u2019s hospitals and physicians came out Wednesday against a House Republican proposal to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, marking the latest round of setbacks to the controversial plan. Seven groups speaking on behalf of hospitals, health systems and medical colleges collectively added their \u201csignificant concerns\u201d to the growing opposition, focusing on the prospect of sharply lower numbers of insured Americans if the GOP plan becomes law. Separately, the American Medical Association, a powerful lobbying group for physicians, rejected the bill for the same reason.",
        "For years, when President Trump pitched a new property that had his name in glittering gold letters above the door, he would throw himself into the sale: showy appearances with an entourage and a rush of boastful television interviews. But the Republican proposal to revise the Affordable Care Act is not a hotel \u2014 and Trump\u2019s salesmanship has been understated by comparison. There is still urgency in his efforts, just markedly less Trump. And the administration is being cagey about its branding. \u201cI\u2019ll let others provide a description for it.",
        "Donald Trump was elected president on this basic idea: Everyone currently in the government is dumb and makes bad deals. I am smart and make good deals. Many people believed that despite their doubts about Trump\u2019s style and persona he was, fundamentally, right. Government had and for way too long. Politicians had their chance. Now it was time to turn things over to someone who had actually sat across a boardroom table and cut deals in the real world.",
        "You might think of it as the legislative equivalent of flying into a storm without instruments. Two committees in the House have begun drafting sweeping health legislation without the benefit of an objective estimate of its impact from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \u2014 a reckless move, critics say, considering that they are dealing with the of tens of millions of Americans and an industry that accounts for close to of the economy.",
        "BEIRUT \u2014 The U. S. military is getting drawn into a deepening struggle for control over areas liberated from the Islamic State that risks prolonging American involvement in wars in Syria and Iraq long after the militants are defeated. In their first diversion from the task of fighting the Islamic State since the U. S. military\u2019s involvement began in 2014, U. S. troops dispatched to Syria have headed in recent days to the northern town of Manbij, 85 miles northwest of the extremists\u2019 capital, Raqqa, to protect their Kurdish and Arab allies against a threatened assault by other U.",
        "Marines from an amphibious task force have left their ships in the Middle East and deployed to Syria, establishing an outpost from which they can fire artillery guns in support of the fight to take back the city of Raqqa from the Islamic State, defense officials said. The deployment marks a new escalation in the U. S. war in Syria, and puts more conventional U. S. troops in the battle. Several hundred Special Operations troops have advised local forces there for months, but the Pentagon has mostly shied away from using conventional forces in Syria.",

        "Let\u2019s hope there\u2019s generous funding in Republicans\u2019 new bill to prevent and cure . Wednesday was International Women\u2019s Day, and to observe this annual commemoration House Republicans formally took up their legislation defunding Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s largest provider of health services for women. House Speaker Paul Ryan, at a news conference Wednesday morning, boasted about ending the funding of Planned Parenthood, listing it as one of the things \u201cwe\u2019ve been dreaming about doing. \u201d And what better time to make this dream come true than on International Women\u2019s Day, on the eighth day of Women\u2019s History Month?",
        "David C. Frederick is a lawyer at the firm Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick who specializes in Supreme Court and appellate practice. As a longtime supporter of Democratic candidates and progressive causes, I understand the anger at the Republicans\u2019 mistreatment of Judge Merrick Garland after he was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Barack Obama. Partisan advantage reigned over fairness of process, and an exceptionally fine jurist was treated shabbily.",
        "We shouldn\u2019t blithely move on to other matters until we deal with the institutional carnage inflicted upon us by President Trump. The current president of the United States has accused former president Barack Obama of committing a felony by having him wiretapped. But Trump refuses to offer a shred of evidence for perhaps the most incendiary charge one president has ever leveled against another. Trump recklessly set off a mighty explosion and his spokespeople duck and dodge, hoping we\u2019ll pretend nothing happened.",
        "The progressive mob that disrupted Charles Murray\u2019s appearance last week at Middlebury College was protesting a 1994 book read by few if any of the protesters. Some of them denounced \u201ceugenics,\u201d thereby demonstrating an interesting ignorance: Eugenics \u2014 controlled breeding to improve the heritable traits of human beings \u2014 was a progressive cause. In \u201cThe Bell Curve,\u201d Murray, a social scientist at the American Enterprise Institute, and his Harvard University psychologist Richard J.",
        "Democrats denouncing the new House GOP bill should actually be dancing in the streets. Perhaps, in the privacy of their own homes, the savvier ones are popping the champagne corks. The true meaning of the proposed legislation is that, after eight years of political and ideological struggle against Obamacare, Republicans have surrendered \u2014 pretty much on all fronts. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) should have written the bill on a large white tablecloth and run it up the nearest flagpole. Yes, yes, the plan is labeled \u201crepeal and replace.",
        "THOUGH PRESIDENT TRUMP\u2019S opening weeks have been chaotic and dispiriting, the nation\u2019s new chief executive has still managed to make a few good choices. One of his best was nominating Rod J. Rosenstein to be the No. 2 at the Justice Department. The sooner the Senate confirms him, the sooner the administration will have another adult in its top ranks. So it\u2019s unfortunate that Mr. Rosenstein faced demands from Democrats at his Tuesday confirmation hearing that no one in his position should accede to. As deputy attorney general, Mr.",
        "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump has offered former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman the position as U. S. ambassador to Russia, a and sensitive post amid investigations into the contacts between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. Trump made the offer to Huntsman earlier this week, according to a White House official not authorized to discuss the move publicly until it is announced. Huntsman has indicated that he will accept the post, the official said Wednesday. The former governor did not immediately return a request for comment. Huntsman has twice before served as an ambassador.",
        "President Trump\u2019s pledge to create a program that funds $1 trillion in new infrastructure programs has kicked off with numerous meetings but few firm decisions, beset by understaffing, bureaucratic challenges and major questions about how to pay for everything. Trump promised in a February speech to Congress that a $1 trillion infrastructure rebuilding plan would create \u201cmillions of new jobs,\u201d but few of those jobs are expected to materialize this year, because no firm deadlines have been set and much of the planning could spill into 2018.",
        "Samsung on Wednesday said that it is looking into reports based on WikiLeaks documents that the Central Intelligence Agency may have developed a way to access Samsung SmartTVs to control some features of the device and to record conversations within range of the television. According to the documents, which have not been confirmed by the CIA, the agency was able to use a \u201cFake Off\u201d mode to make the television appear inactive and record conversations.",
        "If it\u2019s true that \u201cyou are what you eat,\u201d then there is perhaps no better way to understand someone than by looking at his or her teeth. Especially if that person has been dead for more than 40, 000 years. This is the philosophy of Keith Dobney, a professor of human paleoecology at the University of Liverpool and a of a new study that draws some remarkable conclusions about the lives of Neanderthals by peering beneath their dental enamel."
