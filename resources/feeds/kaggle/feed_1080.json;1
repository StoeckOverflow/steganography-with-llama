        "Top infectious disease experts are warning about a rapidly spreading outbreak of deadly yellow fever in Brazil that could hit parts of the United States. The danger would be most acute if the virus starts spreading by the same mosquito that transmits Zika. The outbreak in Brazil has been underway since December, mostly in rural areas in the southeastern part of the country. It\u2019s taking place primarily in jungle areas, where mosquitoes are spreading the virus mainly to monkeys.",
        "As Redskins General Manager Scot McCloughan\u2019s absence from Redskins Park continued for another day Wednesday, it has become clear that his departure from the team is inevitable, according to multiple people with knowledge of the situation. Team President Bruce Allen told reporters at the NFL Scouting Combine last week that McCloughan would return to work as soon as \u201cfamily matters\u201d were handled. However, three people close to the Redskins say relations between Allen and McCloughan have soured to the point that the general manager\u2019s return is now viewed as virtually impossible.",
        "A wildflower superbloom is underway in the desert Southwest in March after seven inches of winter rain. State Park in California hasn\u2019t experienced a bloom so prolific since at least 1999 according to park officials. \u201cThis is shaping up to be a great wildflower year!\u201d the park wrote on its Facebook page late last week. \u201c \u2026 desert lilies are spectacular, and other annuals are coming along nicely! Make plans now to visit near the middle of the month. \u201d The purple sand verbena is widespread in the right now.",
        "In 1991, Michigan man Gregory Green stabbed his wife in the face and chest, killing her and their unborn child. Then, he called 911 and waited for police to come. After serving about 16 years in prison for murder, Green was released on parole with the support of family and friends, including a pastor who lobbied on his behalf and whose daughter Green would marry. \u201cGregory and I were friends before his mishap and he was incarcerated,\u201d Fred Harris, a pastor in Detroit, wrote to the Michigan parole board in August 2005.",
        "Our final lessons from Paris Fashion Week on what lies ahead this fall for fashion: PARIS \u2014 Fashion isn\u2019t so haphazard any more. It\u2019s more polished. A little more dressed up and covered up. Indeed, when Nicki Minaj turned up at the Haider Ackermann show over the weekend with her boob hanging out for all to see, few admired the rapper\u2019s daring. Dismayed that such a talented performer could so poorly misjudge the setting and the crowd, most folks simply shook their heads: What a pity. Mind you, fashion hasn\u2019t turned formal and stuffy. It\u2019s just the opposite.",
        "In the Gathering for Justice office in New York, the women used paper on the walls to not only keep track of the number of speakers \u2014 keeping it to 50 \u2014 but also to make sure all organizations and issues were represented. (Kisha Bari) One Facebook post by a retired attorney in Hawaii in November after the 2016 election surprised many by the way it stirred emotions in millions of women worldwide \u2014 so much that they took to the streets the day after the inauguration of President Trump.",
        "A Republican proposal to revise the Affordable Care Act claimed its first major victories Thursday amid a backlash that both Republican leaders and President Trump spent the day trying to tamp down. Trump met with conservative critics of the plan, signaling both a willingness to negotiate its details and that it does not yet have enough votes to emerge from the House. More acknowledgment of the proposal\u2019s problems came from Senate Republicans, who suggested Thursday that the measure is moving too quickly through the House and in a form unlikely to succeed if it gets to the upper chamber.",
        "Sen. Tom Cotton ( .) took a page out of President Trump\u2019s playbook Thursday morning, taking to Twitter to set the tone for the day in Washington. But his message was decidedly counter to Trump\u2019s wishes. [Trump goes into dealmaking mode, works behind the scenes on health bill] After House Republicans \u2014 in the wee hours of Thursday morning \u2014 passed their Obamacare replacement through committee, Cotton wielded a giant metaphorical stop sign \u2014 before 6 a. m. 1. House bill can\u2019t pass Senate major changes. To my friends in House: pause, start over.",
        "A congressman who spent three decades as a physician \u2014 and is now part of a group of Republican doctors who have a major role in replacing Obamacare \u2014 is facing backlash after saying that poor people \u201cjust don\u2019t want health care and aren\u2019t going to take care of themselves. \u201d Rep. Roger Marshall, ( .) a member of the GOP Doctors Caucus, said comments he made to STAT were not meant to suggest that poor people take health care for granted.",
        "This story has been updated. EPA chief Scott Pruitt, speaking on CNBC Thursday morning, made one of his strongest statements yet rejecting the science of climate change. \u201cI think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there\u2019s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, so no, I would not agree that it\u2019s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see,\u201d Pruitt said on the program \u201cSquawk Box. \u201d \u201cBut we don\u2019t know that yet,\u201d he continued.",
        "From the start of his presidential campaign, Donald Trump pledged \u201ctotal change,\u201d delivering his promises with a political vocabulary \u2014 \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted,\u201d \u201cCrooked Hillary,\u201d \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d \u201clock her up. \u201d Some found his language appalling, but others found it refreshing enough to make him president. Now, in the Oval Office, Trump and his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, have moved beyond the campaign\u2019s embrace of political incorrectness to shake official Washington with a new vocabulary that breaks from the usual terms of debate. Bannon rails against the \u201ccorporatist, globalist media. \u201d Trump talks about \u201ca global power structure.",
        "When he was Ronald Reagan\u2019s secretary of state, George Shultz was once asked about the CIA\u2019s disavowal of involvement in a mysterious recent bombing in Lebanon. Replied Shultz: \u201cIf the CIA denies something, it\u2019s denied. \u201d Has there ever been a more dry, more wry, more ironic verdict on the world of espionage? Within it, there is admission and denial, smoke and mirrors, impenetrable fog and deliberate obfuscation. Truth? Ask the next guy. Which is why my default view of espionage is to never believe anyone because everyone is trained in deception.",
        "There is a deep divide in the United States, and it isn\u2019t or . It\u2019s between those who believe in applying the law as it exists and those who think they have the right \u2014 through various government authorities \u2014 to ignore laws they don\u2019t like. \u201cRule of law\u201d conservatives are a subset of the coalition that elected President Trump.",
        "Rex Tillerson is off to an agonizingly slow start as secretary of state. That matters, because if Tillerson doesn\u2019t develop a stronger voice, control of foreign policy is likely to move increasingly toward Stephen K. Bannon, the insurgent populist who is chief White House strategist. Tillerson\u2019s State Department has been in idle gear these past two months. He doesn\u2019t have a deputy or other top aides. His spokesman can\u2019t give guidance on key issues, because decisions haven\u2019t yet been made. Tillerson didn\u2019t attend important meetings with foreign leaders.",
        "Douglas is president of the American Action Forum and former director of the Congressional Budget Office. The draft legislative texts that will make up the American Health Care Act cleared two House committees this week amid vociferous complaints about the legislation, seemingly from all quarters. At some level this is understandable. After all, nobody expected the Democrats to stand up and applaud a replacement for the Affordable Care Act. And for Republicans, three other factors contribute. First, reform is hard, and there are widely varying views of the best policy. Second, these are draft bills, not final legislation.",
        "It\u2019s time to put an end to the myth that Republicans believe in fiscal responsibility. Saving taxpayer dollars takes a back seat to the ideological imperative of blaming and shaming the poor. Witness the GOP\u2019s plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. House committees are moving forward on the legislation before the Congressional Budget Office has even had a chance to estimate how much the measure will cost. Why the rush? Because if the plan doesn\u2019t snatch away health insurance coverage from millions of people \u2014 and both President Trump and House Speaker Paul D.",
        "THE ELECTION of President Trump has prompted a lot of talk about the checks and balances of the American constitutional system. As guarantors of freedom and stability, James Madison\u2019s cherished devices \u2014 separation of powers, an independent judiciary, freedom of the press \u2014 will be tested as never before, it has been said. But another potential check on presidential action has gotten less attention: the sheer power of reality. There are some things Mr. Trump won\u2019t be able to do because, well, he just can\u2019t. Call it the reality check.",
        "A groundbreaking climate lawsuit, brought against the federal government by 21 children, has been hailed by environmentalists as a bold new strategy to press for climate action in the United States. But the Trump administration, which has pledged to undo Barack Obama\u2019s climate regulations, is doing its best to make sure the case doesn\u2019t get far. The Trump administration this week filed a motion to overturn a ruling by a federal judge back in November that cleared the lawsuit for trial \u2014 and filed a separate motion to delay trial preparation until that appeal is considered.",
        "WikiLeaks will release to tech firms the software code of CIA hacking tools that were designed to compromise smartphones and other products, the group\u2019s founder said Thursday, attempting to position himself as a defender of cybersecurity and probably further antagonizing the intelligence community. \u201cWe have decided to work with\u201d the firms, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said at a news conference, \u201cto give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details we have so that fixes can be developed and pushed out, so that people can be secured.",
        "Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who sued successfully to block President Trump\u2019s first entry ban, said Thursday that he will ask a federal judge to affirm that the suspension of the initial ban applies to the new one. Ferguson said Trump\u2019s new executive order imposes many of the same economic and other harms as the first one in late January, even though it is different in important ways. And he said a federal judge, rather than the administration, should decide whether the original freeze should remain in place. \u201cThe court decides that,\u201d Ferguson said, \u201cnot the president.",
        "After weeks of speculation, the Washington Redskins fired General Manager Scot McCloughan on Thursday, a little more than two years into a contract. The decision was announced by team President Bruce Allen, who said the Redskins wished McCloughan \u201cwell in his future endeavors. The team will have no further comment on his departure. \u201d An official with direct knowledge of the situation attributed the decision to McCloughan\u2019s ongoing problems with alcohol, which also led to his firing from front office positions with the San Francisco 49ers in 2010 and Seattle Seahawks in 2014.",
        "A new legal front is opening in the war against the nation\u2019s opioid crisis as attorneys begin to pursue major corporations that distribute prescription painkillers. They are seeking billions of dollars in reimbursements for the devastation the drugs have caused in communities across the country. Attorneys in West Virginia, which has the highest opioid overdose rate in the nation, filed lawsuits in federal court Thursday on behalf of two counties and targeting some of the nation\u2019s largest drug distribution companies. A dozen attorneys general in states are considering similar suits against many of the same companies.",
        "BERLIN \u2014 German police swarmed the main train station in the city of D\u00fcsseldorf after an ax attack left at least five people injured, authorities said. D\u00fcsseldorf police spokeswoman Anja Kynast said several people had been injured and one arrest had been made. Police were investigating the motive for the attack, she said. Another police spokesman, Andreas Czogalla, said that at least one of the victims had been seriously injured and that there were no indications of other attackers. Special units for serious crimes had been dispatched to the scene, he said.",
        "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was asked by Politico\u2019s Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer on Thursday morning whether he believed that Mexico would, ultimately, foot the cost for the border wall President Trump wants built on our southern border. \u201cUh, no,\u201d was McConnell\u2019s blunt response, according to CNN\u2019s Manu Raju. That\u2019s the general feeling within the GOP political establishment when it comes to the prospect of Mexico paying the estimated $12 billion to $15 billion cost of the border wall.",
        "At Cork Wine Bar, owners Khalid Pitts and Diane Gross host corporate dinners, political fundraisers, embassy receptions and an array of other events for clients looking for a casually elegant setting offering more than 200 wines from around the world. But the couple contend their Logan Circle business would be better off if not for a new player in town who they claim is operating with an unfair and illegal advantage: President Donald Trump, owner of the $212 million Trump International Hotel he opened last fall.",
        "The White House and Republican House leaders came together Friday behind the plan now moving through Congress to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, including a provision criticized by conservatives pressing for a more aggressive attack on the law. After President Trump met at the White House with key House committee chairmen, his chief spokesman said the president fully supports the bill\u2019s timeline for phasing out the expansion of Medicaid under the ACA, which some on the right would like to accelerate.",
        "The Republican proposal to replace the Affordable Care Act would strip away what advocates say is essential coverage for drug addiction treatment as the number of people dying from opiate overdoses is skyrocketing nationwide. Beginning in 2020, the plan would eliminate an Affordable Care Act requirement that Medicaid cover basic and addiction services in states that expanded it, allowing them to decide whether to include those benefits in Medicaid plans.",
        "Over the course of the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump looked for ways to suggest that the economy was in turmoil. While the picture for every American wasn\u2019t rosy, the country was in much better shape than it had been a few years earlier at the tail end of the Great Recession. So as a candidate Trump cobbled together several unorthodox measures that he\u2019d discuss at campaign stops and in interviews to suggest that things weren\u2019t as great as they looked. On Friday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released jobs numbers from Trump\u2019s first full month in office.",
        "doctors will be allowed to work shifts in hospitals across the United States starting July 1, when a cap that limits the physicians to 16 consecutive hours of patient care is lifted, the organization that oversees their training announced Friday. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education said the change will enhance patient safety because there will be fewer handoffs from doctor to doctor. It also said the longer shifts will improve the new doctors\u2019 training by allowing them to follow their patients for more extended periods, especially in the critical hours after admission.",
        "BEDMINSTER, N. J. \u2014 In rural New Jersey, the president\u2019s business has proposed an unusual real estate project. It wants to build a cemetery. Or maybe not. Or maybe two. According to plans filed with local and state authorities, the Trump Organization has proposed to build a pair of graveyards at the site of its tony Trump National Bedminster golf course. One would be small, 10 plots overlooking the first hole. It was intended \u2014 or so they said \u2014 for Trump and his family. \u201cMr. Trump . . ."
