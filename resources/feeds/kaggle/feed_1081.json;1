        "President Trump tweeted almost a week ago that he \u201cjust found out\u201d that former president Barack Obama wiretapped him during the 2016 election. Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my \u201dwires tapped\u201d in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! \u2014 Donald J.",
        "South Korea is in an uproar. Crowds numbering in the hundreds of thousands have been surging through the streets of Seoul, the capital city. Some of the marchers are celebrating a ruling Friday by the Constitutional Court, which has upheld the impeachment of President Park . Others who support the president have been angrily denouncing the court, leading to clashes with police that have resulted in the deaths of two protesters. All of this turmoil is taking place against the backdrop of ominous gestures from North Korea, which fired off a salvo of four missiles in a test Monday.",
        "Albert Teich is research professor of science, technology and international affairs at George Washington University. For years, our outdated and overly complex immigration system for scientists and engineers has threatened our nation\u2019s position as a magnet for scientific and engineering talent from all over the world. Now, the government is finally taking action, only it\u2019s in the wrong direction. It has decided to make it more difficult \u2014 not easier \u2014 for foreign scientists and students to come to the United States and for U. S. scientists to collaborate with colleagues in other countries.",
        "President Trump is not an ideologue \u2014 not because he\u2019s but because he has little in the way of particular beliefs about policy. He does, however, have impulses, inclinations and prejudices. House Speaker Paul Ryan ( .) on the other hand, is an ideologue, as are many if not most of his compatriots in Congress. Put that Congress and this White House together, and you get a Republican government with a clear and coherent ideology, one you can sum up in a short declarative statement: You\u2019re on your own.",
        "Mitchel Malkus is a rabbi and head of the Charles E. Smith Jewish Day School in Rockville. What happens when someone calls a school to say he plans to blow up the building while spouting a vile and sadistic tirade? On Monday, the school I lead received such a call. One moment smiling, students were entering the campus to begin their week; the next that sense of joy and welcome was shattered and became dread and danger.",
        "This week, we have watched the perfect example of a country fighting the last war. The Trump administration has devoted weeks of energy and political capital to rolling out its temporary travel ban against citizens of six countries, none of whom, according to the libertarian Cato Institute, have committed a single deadly terrorist attack in the United States over the past four decades. Meanwhile, the White House\u2019s response to a devastating barrage of WikiLeaks disclosures that will compromise U. S. security for years was a general vow to prosecute leakers.",
        "AT HIS inauguration, President Trump struck a grand note of economic nationalism: \u201cWe will follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire American. \u201d Four days later, on Jan. 24, he ordered a restart to the Keystone XL oil pipeline; in the following weeks, he repeatedly implied that he had done so on the condition that the tube linking Alberta, Canada, with refineries on the Gulf of Mexico would be constructed of American steel. Well, promises were made to be modified.",

        "The Justice Department announced Friday that Attorney General Jeff Sessions has asked all 46 remaining Obama administration U. S. attorneys to resign. \u201cAs was the case in prior transitions, many of the United States attorneys nominated by the previous administration already have left the Department of Justice,\u201d said Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores in a statement. \u201cThe Attorney General has now asked the remaining 46 presidentially appointed U. S. Attorneys to tender their resignations in order to ensure a uniform transition. \u201c Flores said that until new U. S.",
        "On Saturday, the military news website the War Horse reported on the existence of a shared drive containing hundreds of naked photos of female service members that had been posted to a closed Facebook group with about 30, 000 members, many of them Marines. [\u2018I\u2019m never reenlisting\u2019: Marine Corps rocked by scandal] The article, written by a former Marine and Purple Heart recipient, rapidly gained national attention, prompting condemnation from Marine officials and public outcry. Members of the Facebook group at the center of the scandal, called Marines United, sent death threats to the report\u2019s author.",
        "President Trump is expected to pick Scott Gottlieb, a conservative physician and businessman with deep ties to the pharmaceutical industry, to be commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, a person familiar with the nomination said Friday. If confirmed, Gottlieb would bring a strong deregulatory approach to an agency that Trump has criticized as being overly restrictive. But he is also viewed as someone who would preserve the agency\u2019s basic function: to ensure that drugs are proven to be safe and effective before they are allowed to be sold.",
        "Ivanka Trump\u2019s products weren\u2019t always the hottest items online. In January, for instance, the first daughter\u2019s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion website in the world, according to Forbes. That changed dramatically the following month. Sales of Trump\u2019s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst\u2019s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before. Yes, Feb.",

        "One of the first things Jesse Bright did after being pulled over by police on a recent Sunday afternoon was turn on his phone and begin filming. Bright was driving for Uber to make some extra cash, but he works as criminal defense attorney in North Carolina. As a lawyer, he said, he believes strongly that when people record their interactions with police, it helps reduce confusion if their cases end up in court. As he aimed his phone in the direction of officers and recorded, Bright was surprised to hear Wilmington police Sgt.",
        "Live TV is an unpredictable yet delightful beast. Professor Robert Kelly, an international relations expert, discovered just that Friday during an interview with BBC World News about South Korean President Park \u2019s impeachment. Kelly, a widely respected political science professor at Pusan National University in South Korea, was providing his expert opinion on camera, from what appeared to be his home office, when his young children came barreling into the room. \u201cI would argue that this is a triumph of democracy,\u201d Kelly said via Skype. \u201cScandals happen all the time.",

        "Employers could impose hefty penalties on employees who decline to participate in genetic testing as part of workplace wellness programs if a bill approved by a U. S. House committee this week becomes law. In general, employers don\u2019t have that power under existing federal laws, which protect genetic privacy and nondiscrimination. But a bill passed Wednesday by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce would allow employers to get around those obstacles if the information is collected as part of a workplace wellness program.",
        "In the three years before he became Donald Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon lived as a virtual nomad in a quest to build a populist political insurgency. No presidential adviser in recent memory has followed such a mysterious, peripatetic path to the White House. It was as though he was a man with no fixed address. He owned a house and condo in Southern California, where he had entertainment and consulting businesses, a driver\u2019s license and a checking account.",
        "On the day of North Korea\u2019s first atomic test in 2006, aides to President George W. Bush began phoning foreign capitals to reassure allies startled by Pyongyang\u2019s surprising feat. The test, aides said, had been mostly a failure: a botched, cry for attention from a regime that had no warheads or reliable delivery systems and would never be allowed to obtain them. \u201cThe current course that they are on is unacceptable,\u201d State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said publicly at the time, \u201cand the international community is going to act. \u201d A decade later, that confidence has all but evaporated.",
        "In our divided nation, it seems civility has gone out of fashion. In his inaugural address, President Trump called for Americans to prioritize openness, honesty and the need to \u201cspeak our minds. \u201d At the time, the president\u2019s demotion of the theme of civility (rhetorically central to both of his predecessors) shocked no one. More surprising, perhaps, is the speed at which partisans on both sides \u2014 including some of his fiercest critics \u2014 have taken his advice to heart.",
        "Watching the debate in this country over public safety, you\u2019d think some people wish to live securely, while others welcome Armageddon. Conservative pundit Bill O\u2019Reilly recently went after \u201cliberal politicians\u201d in Chicago and San Francisco, noting crime in those cities and saying, \u201cThe situation is out of control and a disgrace, and that\u2019s what happens when incompetent politicians demand the police stop enforcing laws. \u201d The truth is, we all want to be safe. The struggle isn\u2019t about outcomes, it\u2019s about methods. Should law enforcement have ready access to everyone\u2019s phone data?",
        "Michael Brown\u2019s death on the streets of Ferguson, Mo. on Aug. 9, 2014, changed the national conversation about policing and race. Police abuse became daily news; the Black Lives Matter movement was born; race and inequality turned into mainstream political issues. Underlining much of the discussion after Brown\u2019s shooting was a March 2015 report by the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division that detailed how the Ferguson police department and municipal court had destroyed the lives of thousands of African American residents. Statistics, data analysis and scores of startling stories filled the report.",
        "Daylight saving time, which takes effect this weekend, seems innocuous: a trivial harassment, an annoying vestige of an earlier age, a pointless hardship imposed on us by technocrats. It is all of those things. The measure was introduced to solve a problem created by the shift from local solar time to standard clock time \u2014 as daytime shortened in winter, more productive activity was locked into nighttime hours, in an era when artificial light was far more expensive than it is today.",
        "At the center of many allegations swirling around the Trump administration\u2019s relationship with Moscow is one man: Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador. As U. S. intelligence agencies contend that his country attempted, through hacking and other efforts, to influence November\u2019s election, Kislyak\u2019s discussions with Trump campaign associates \u2014 including former national security adviser Michael Flynn (who resigned for not disclosing them) and Attorney General Jeff Sessions (who did not) \u2014 have been the subject of intense reporting and speculation.",

Darrell Issa ( .) endured pointed questions, jeers and derisive laughter during two successive town halls in this northern suburb of San Diego. But this wasn\u2019t just a moment for Issa to let anxious constituents vent their worries about immigration policy, reform or the first seven weeks of President Trump\u2019s tenure. It was a major first test of the Democratic Party\u2019s efforts to turn antipathy toward Trump into electoral gains in 2018.",
        "LOUISVILLE \u2014 Vice President Pence was in full charm mode Saturday when he touched down here for a visit to try to sell the Republican plan in a state that has a complex relationship with former president Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. Just a day earlier, Kentucky\u2019s Republican Gov. Matt Bevin had told reporters that while he is eager to overhaul Obama\u2019s health plan, he found himself skeptical of the initial Republican proposal and more in line with the views of Sen. Rand Paul ( .) who has been an outspoken opponent of the bill."
