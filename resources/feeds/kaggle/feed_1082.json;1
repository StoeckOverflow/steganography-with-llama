She was 20 weeks pregnant at the time and couldn\u2019t wait to become a mother. That\u2019s when a doctor walked into her examination room and delivered the news that still haunts her six years later. \u201cThey told me my baby\u2019s abdomen was full of fluid \u2014 and if nothing changed very soon, it was going to stop her heart,\u201d Tittle told The Washington Post, recalling the 2011 incident. \u201cIt was a horrible, horrible experience.",
        "The federal Endangered Species Act has been called the world\u2019s gold standard for environmental protection. Passed in 1973, it strengthened earlier federal protections for animals that had been nearly wiped out by humans, including bald eagles, humpback whales and California condors. But the act has faced opposition from those who believe it unfairly protects animals that sometimes poach livestock and that it unfairly restricts land use. At a recent hearing to discuss \u201cmodernizing the Endangered Species Act,\u201d Sen. John Barrasso ( .) head of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said the ESA \u201cis not working today.",
        "If President Trump is the finicky client describing what he wants for a monstrous project along the Mexican border, Stephen Colbert is the flummoxed architect trying to fashion a blueprint from his bombastic adjectives. On The Late Show ? Friday night, Colbert assembled a team of builders to come up with a ballpark estimate of how much it would cost to erect the president s promised wall. The answer: a lot, based on Trump s descriptions. That wall is going to be so big and so strong and so powerful, ?",

        "Depending on which outside analyst you ask, between 6 million and 15 million people would probably lose insurance coverage if the Republican alternative to the Affordable Care Act passes Congress and is signed into law. Or, actually, let\u2019s revise that. Depending on whom you ask in Republican leadership, the real number is more like zero \u2014 or, perhaps, negative: People will gain coverage under the proposal.

        "ISTANBUL \u2014 So far in a rancorous campaign season, the Turkish government or its opponents have invoked Nazi Germany, terrorist groups, fifth columnists and a Latin American dictator.

        "On Monday afternoon, the Congressional Budget Office released its analysis of the American Health Care Act, the Republican legislation intended to replace the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare. One of the most highly anticipated parts of the analysis was how the CBO would estimate that the AHCA might affect insurance coverage.
