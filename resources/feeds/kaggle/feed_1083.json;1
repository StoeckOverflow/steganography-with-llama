        "Six weeks into a new administration, with unified Republican government for the first time in a decade, the GOP should be busy enacting a bold reform agenda. Instead, the party is wracked by internal divisions on key issues from health care to taxes. After House Republicans released their bill to repeal and replace Obamacare it was attacked from all sides of the GOP spectrum \u2014 with conservatives calling it \u201cObamacare lite\u201d and moderates openly worrying it won\u2019t do enough for the Obamacare Medicaid expansion population or those who will lose their Obamacare subsidies.",
        "LONDON \u2014 Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon defiantly and unexpectedly announced Monday that she will seek a new independence referendum, forcing British leaders to try to prevent their country from ripping apart even as they negotiate a divorce from the European Union. With Britain poised to trigger the start of its E. U. departure by month\u2019s end, Sturgeon said she will push for a vote on Scottish independence in autumn 2018 or spring 2019 \u2014 likely just before the United Kingdom leaves the union.

        "At their first meeting, the Japanese prime minister presented President Trump with a golf club \u2014 and when he returned for a second visit, the two played 27 holes in a single day. The British prime minister, eager to reaffirm her country\u2019s \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the United States, made a point of visiting Trump on only his seventh full day in office \u2014 and the two held hands as they strolled the West Wing Colonnade.",
        "BERLIN  \u201d In Germany, he was a California boy made good  \u201d a   old from Fresno whose thriving burger joint in the western city of Essen served up towering plates of greasy American goodness. Then Nicholas Smith came out on national television as a Trump fan. What followed  \u201d a de facto boycott of his restaurant, followed by its surprise rescue by the German right  \u201d suggests how the polarization of the Trump era has gone global.",
        "Senate Democrats are preparing to fight back against GOP plans to fund President Trump\u2019s wall on the U. S. border, even if it means threatening a government shutdown at the end of April. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( . Y.) and other top Senate Democrats warned GOP leaders Monday that they will block any attempt to use the budget process to begin construction of the wall \u2014 especially because the president has not specified how he plans to pay for it.",

        "Concern is mounting among evangelicals that Russell Moore, president of the Southern Baptist Convention\u2019s policy arm, could lose his job following months of backlash over his critiques of President Trump and religious leaders who publicly supported the Republican candidate. Any such move could be explosive for the nation\u2019s largest Protestant denomination, which has been divided over politics, theology and, perhaps most starkly, race. More than 100 of the denomination\u2019s 46, 000 churches have threatened to cut off financial support for the SBC\u2019s umbrella fund, according to Frank Page, president of the executive committee.",

When Shree Chauhan, a former elementary school teacher who is avowedly not a supporter of President Trump, spotted Spicer at an Apple store in the D. C. area, she decided to ask the press secretary some questions \u201csince he doesn\u2019t like the press,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cI wanted to speak truth to power,\u201d Chauhan said in a Medium post about the incident that was extremely political and far from polite.",
        "It has been more than a week since President Trump alleged that President Barack Obama wiretapped him at Trump Tower, and the White House has spent much of that time trying to talk about basically anything else. Kellyanne Conway isn\u2019t going to help in that effort. In an interview with the Bergen Record, Conway muses about the possibility that such surveillance could be conducted through phones, TVs and even microwaves.",
        "There are few certainties in March Madness, but one story line that plays out almost every year is a No. 12 seed upsetting a No. 5 seed during the tournament\u2019s round of 64. In fact, 2015 is the only year since 2007 a didn\u2019t pull off the upset. [The perfect bracket to win your March Madness pool] Dating back to 1985, No. 5 seeds have been upset 49 times in 148 games but based on a line that best fits the data, they should be winning closer to 71. 9 percent of these matchups.",

        "White House press secretary Sean Spicer offered a number of attacks and claims during a news briefing dominated by the new Congressional Budget Office report on the House Republican replacement bill for the Affordable Care Act. The report estimated that 24 million fewer people would have health insurance in 2026 if the law were approved in its current form, causing political headaches for the effort to replace Obamacare. Here\u2019s a guide to his rhetoric.",
        "It\u2019s almost as though Republicans are tired of having President Trump\u2019s allegations laid at their feet. Almost. Late Monday, a spokesman for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes ( .) threatened to subpoena the Trump administration to produce evidence of Trump\u2019s claim that President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower during the campaign. The White House has declined to produce this evidence publicly, offering various excuses, including the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers and \u2014 most recently on Monday \u2014 arguing that Trump wasn\u2019t speaking literally when he made the claim.",

Inhofe has raged against the scientific consensus that humans are fueling climate change, calling it \u201cthe greatest hoax\u201d ever perpetrated on Americans.

Ryan ( .) says Obamacare is in a \u201cdeath spiral,\u201d and he should know: He\u2019s the one who cut the power to Obamacare\u2019s engines and pointed its nose downward.

        "A joint news conference in February between President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prompted numerous complaints from media outlets. They\u2019d been shut out of the Q&A session in favor of news outlets that they considered friendly to the interests of the Trump White House.

        "Sam van der Staak is the Head for Europe at the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA). The people of the Netherlands are heading to the polls on March 15, and international attention toward the small European country is at a historic high.

        "\u201cIT\u2019S JUST not believable,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said Monday, after the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected the GOP\u2019s Obamacare bill would result in 24 million more Americans without coverage. Here\u2019s what is not believable: Mr. Price\u2019s prediction that \u201cour plan will cover more individuals at a lower cost and give them the choices that they want for the coverage,\u201d a claim that expert after expert has deemed a fantasy. Many Republicans are doing everything they can to discredit the nonpartisan CBO. But the office backed up its projections with solid and transparent economic analysis.",

        "In 2010 and 2011, groups of armed Somali men were hijacking merchant vessels off Somalia\u2019s coast at an almost daily pace. Thousands of hostages of myriad nationalities were taken, and billions of dollars were lost in ransom, damage and delayed shipments. The crisis was so severe that a naval task force with more than two dozen vessels from European Union countries, the United States, China, Russia, India and Japan banded together to restore order to one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping routes.
