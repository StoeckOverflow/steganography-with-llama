        "Two years ago, Maryland fans turned on the NCAA tournament selection show feeling pretty confident that the Terrapins\u2019 r\u00e9sum\u00e9 merited a No. 3 seed, hence the surprise \u2014 and disappointment \u2014 when Mark Turgeon\u2019s squad was a No. 4 seed in the same region as top overall seed Kentucky. There should be no complaints that Maryland was this year. In fact, the Terrapins are the most team in the field, according to Ken Pomeroy\u2019s metrics.",
        "Everyone loves fantasy sports, but when it comes to college basketball, the two don\u2019t meld. The college game just doesn\u2019t lend itself to fantasy: There are too many teams, too many players, and too much riding on the whim of coaches. But when it comes to March Madness, fantasy interjects an additional dose of excitement into what is already the best sporting event of the year. That\u2019s why we went ahead and listed the field\u2019s top 24 players, if you\u2019re participating in a March Madness fantasy league.",
        "Tamara would often tell me that she was not going to live past 30. Why would she, she defiantly asked, when society treats her as less than human? I first met Tamara on the streets of downtown Lima, Peru, in the summer of 2013. She was 27 and the first trans woman I photographed. I was immediately drawn to her openness, warmth and friendly, inviting attitude. Tamara had struggled with her identity since elementary school, where she was bullied by her peers, leading her to drop out in the fifth grade.",
        "A federal judge in Hawaii has frozen President Trump\u2019s new executive order temporarily barring the issuance of new visas to citizens of majority countries and suspending the admission of new refugees. U. S. District Judge Derrick K. Watson froze the order nationwide. Watson was the second of three judges to hear arguments Wednesday on whether to freeze the ban. A federal judge in Maryland said he also could rule before day\u2019s end after a morning hearing, and the same federal judge in Washington state who suspended Trump\u2019s first travel ban was set to hear arguments starting at 5 p.",
        "House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) on Wednesday defended the embattled GOP plan to revise the Affordable Care Act, calling the measure a \u201c tax cut\u201d and saying its core elements will remain in place despite broad opposition from Republicans, Democrats and the industry. \u201cObviously the major components are staying intact, because this is something we wrote with President Trump. This is something we wrote with the Senate committees. This is the plan we ran on all of last year,\u201d Ryan told the Fox Business Network, adding that he is open to \u201crefinements\u201d and \u201cimprovements.",
        "House Speaker Paul D. Ryan is not backing away from the sweeping health legislation that some opponents are deriding as \u201cRyancare. \u201d The Wisconsin Republican has become the salesman in chief for the plan to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, putting a heavy focus on outlets to try to quell the brewing rebellion on the right flank. On Wednesday morning, he made the pitch on Fox Business Network, his fourth appearance on the constellation of networks owned by Rupert Murdoch in the past week.",
        "[BREAKING: Dutch prime minister claims victory over candidate Geert Wilders] THE HAGUE \u2014 The Dutch political establishment appeared Wednesday to fend off a challenge from firebrand Geert Wilders, according to initial exit polls, potentially blunting the momentum of politicians across Europe. The result, if confirmed by the actual election results, meant that Wilders would remain a powerful voice on immigration issues in the Netherlands. But it would leave in place Prime Minister Mark Rutte and do little to alter the fundamental dynamic in a country unhappy with the status quo but deeply divided among many political parties.",
        "The U. S. military has drawn up early plans that would deploy up to 1, 000 more troops into northern Syria in the coming weeks, expanding the American presence in the country ahead of the offensive on the Islamic State\u2019s de facto capital of Raqqa, according to U. S. defense officials familiar with the matter. The deployment, if approved by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and President Trump, would potentially double the number of U. S. forces in Syria and increase the potential for direct U. S.",
        "Early one morning in October, Chuck Reid stood inside a little office at Buckingham Correctional Center in Dillwyn, Va. waiting for the door to open. A retired county jailer and sheriff\u2019s deputy, Reid was not in the habit of visiting men he had once investigated for murder. But in this case, he had been summoned. And he obliged because 30 years after Jens Soering went off to prison, their lives were entwined once again in a way neither could have anticipated.

        "Here is a brief list of people who have said that President Trump\u2019s allegation that President Barack Obama ordered a wiretap of Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential campaign is simply not true: 1. Devin Nunes The Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who has been one of the few defenders of Trump\u2019s claims, made clear Tuesday that there is zero evidence to suggest Trump Tower was wiretapped. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was an actual tap of Trump Tower,\u201d said Nunes (Calif. ).",

        "Last night the political world went into a frenzy when MSNBC host Rachel Maddow announced she would be revealing some of President Trump\u2019s tax documents. Then there was great disappointment, because she had only the first two summary pages of Trump\u2019s 2005 tax return, which reveals a few things, but not the critical details that lie in the thousands of pages of Trump\u2019s full returns. Where Trump is actually getting his income, whom he owes money to, how far and with whom his interests extend \u2014 all that is still opaque.",
        "\u201cThe law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread. \u201d Novelist Anatole France\u2019s mischievous observation came to mind when the Congressional Budget Office released its analysis of the Republican bill and its defenders went into a continuous loop talking about \u201cfreedom. \u201d Conservatives are fond of saying that freedom isn\u2019t free. This is entirely true, especially when it comes to health care. Republicans speak of the wondrous things that will happen if they succeed in slaying the monster known as \u201cObamacare.",
        "Although the National Endowment for the Arts\u2019 2016 cost of $148 million was less than of 1 percent of the federal budget, attempting to abolish the NEA is a fight worth having, never mind the certain futility of the fight. Let\u2019s pretend, counterfactually, that the NEA no longer funds the sort of rubbish that once immersed it in the culture wars, e. g. \u201cPiss Christ\u201d (a photograph depicting a crucifix immersed in a jar of the artist\u2019s urine) and \u201cGenital Wallpaper\u201d (don\u2019t ask).

        "David Spence is a professor of law, politics and regulation at the University of Texas at Austin. Some of the recent news coverage of resistance to the Trump agenda has invoked the notion of the \u201cdeep state,\u201d a phrase hinting at sinister, unelected bureaucrats undermining the agenda of an elected president. But bureaucratic resistance to presidential control does not necessarily subvert democracy. To the contrary, it often affirms it. careerists \u2014 bureaucrats \u2014 have long been the whipping boys of our political discourse.",
        "WITH CHARACTERISTIC incoherence, the White House simultaneously boasted that leaked data from President Trump\u2019s 2005 tax return demonstrates that Mr. Trump paid his fair share of taxes and denounced the \u201cdishonest media\u201d for publishing these flattering facts. But there would be no need for reporters to \u201cillegally\u201d publish such information, to quote the White House\u2019s absurd accusation against MSNBC and investigative journalist David Cay Johnston, if Mr. Trump himself had simply honored the tradition of releasing his returns while still a candidate for the office he now holds.",
        "The Justice Department announced Wednesday the indictments of two Russian spies and two criminal hackers in connection with the heist of 500 million Yahoo user accounts in 2014, marking the first U. S. criminal cyber charges ever against Russian government officials. The indictments target two members of the Russian intelligence agency FSB, and two hackers hired by the Russians. The charges include hacking, wire fraud, trade secret theft and economic espionage, according to officials. The indictments are part of the largest hacking case brought by the United States.",
        "This post has been updated. When news broke Tuesday night that MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow planned to release some of President Trump\u2019s previously unseen tax returns, the administration wasted little time in replying. Maddow tweeted about the upcoming story at 7:36 p. m. and by 8:23 p. m. the White House was dismissing the story in a statement. After outlining how much was paid and how much income Trump earned, the statement went on to bash the media\u2019s handling: \u201cDespite this substantial income figure and tax paid, it is totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns.",
        "The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate Wednesday, launching into what investors expect to be a more rapid series of increases that will help ward off the threat of inflation but also raise costs for indebted American households. Fed officials voted nearly unanimously following a policy meeting in Washington to raise the key interest rate for overnight lending by a from a range of 0. 5 percent to 0. 75 percent to a range of 0. 75 percent to 1. 0 percent. \u201cThe simple message is the economy is doing well,\u201d Fed Chair Janet L.",
        "No president in recent history has worked harder to publicly associate himself with the U. S. military than Donald Trump. He has filled his Cabinet with retired generals, met behind the scenes with the top brass at a pace that far exceeds that of his predecessor, and on Thursday will drop a defense budget that promises a big spending boost for the Pentagon.",

        "A Republican congressman from Texas is caught in a firestorm after he told a constituent to \u201cshut up. \u201d Rep. Joe Barton ( .) was speaking Saturday at a town hall event in Frost, a small town not far from Arlington, when he said he opposed federal legislation protecting women from violence, because it is a state issue. The crowd erupted over Barton\u2019s remarks, and the moment was captured on video. \u201cViolence against women \u2014 that\u2019s a national issue!\u201d an attendee shouted. \u201cThat is an issue that impacts everyone, everywhere \u2014 not only in this country but everywhere.",
        "The afternoon before the blizzard predicted for New York City fizzled out, the National Weather Service knew the storm might not produce the epic snow amounts it had forecast. But because it didn\u2019t want to \u201cconfuse\u201d the public, it decided to continue emphasizing the scenario. This was a but flawed decision that has the potential to damage public trust in weather forecasts.

        "Some of President Trump\u2019s best friends in Congress sharply criticized his first budget Thursday, with defense hawks saying the proposed hike in Pentagon spending wasn\u2019t big enough, while rural conservatives and others attacked plans to cut a wide range of federal agencies and programs. The bad mood among Republican critics was tempered by a consensus that the president\u2019s budget wasn\u2019t going very far on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers reminded everybody that they ultimately control the nation\u2019s purse strings.",
        "If you\u2019re a poor person in America, President Trump\u2019s budget proposal is not for you. Trump has unveiled a budget that would slash or abolish programs that have provided Americans with help on virtually all fronts, including affordable housing, banking, weatherizing homes, job training, paying home heating oil bills, and obtaining legal counsel in civil matters. During the presidential campaign last year, Trump vowed that the solution to poverty was giving poor people incentives to work.",
        "Under President Trump\u2019s budget proposal, federal employees at many agencies may need to acquaint themselves with a lately dormant but still term: Reduction in Force. If Trump\u2019s budget is enacted into law, it would hike defense spending by $54 billion \u2014 and pay for it with an equal cut in domestic spending at other federal agencies. Trump has said that reducing the size of the federal workforce \u2014 better known by its acronym, RIF \u2014 is a top priority. It may not be as easy as Trump would like.",
