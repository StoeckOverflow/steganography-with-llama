        "President Trump released his budget on Thursday, and the funding cuts are being dissected left and right. There are 19 federal agencies that have the distinction of facing a 100 percent cut \u2014 i. e. extinction. The cuts to these agencies total about $3 billion. They offset about 6 percent of the $54 billion Trump wants to add in military spending. But what do these agencies do? Below, we explore. President Trump just released his budget plan for the next fiscal year, which proposes some big changes in government spending.",
        "Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told agency employees in a letter Thursday morning that next year\u2019s budget proposal, marked by deep funding cuts, is an \u201cunmistakable restatement\u201d of the country\u2019s needs and a harbinger of new priorities. The letter, emailed to State employees as Tillerson was traveling in Asia, came shortly after the administration released a blueprint of plans to cut more than $10 billion, or 28 percent, out of the core budget for the State Department and the U. S. Agency for International Development.",
        "Things got very contentious in the White House briefing room Thursday afternoon, as press secretary Sean Spicer was confronted with the bipartisan doubts of congressional leaders about Trump\u2019s claims that President Barack Obama wiretapped him. At one point, Spicer spent several minutes reading through a list of reports that he felt bolstered Trump\u2019s claim. Journalists, meanwhile, pushed back on the evidence Spicer provided, none of which addressed Trump\u2019s central claim that Obama was behind the alleged surveillance of Trump Tower, and some of which came from dubious ideologically tinged sources such as Sean Hannity.",
        "TOKYO \u2014 The Trump administration made a clear break Thursday with diplomatic efforts to talk North Korea out of a nuclear confrontation, bringing the United States and its Asian allies closer to a military response than at any point in more than a decade. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that 20 years of trying to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear program had failed and that he was visiting Asia \u201cto exchange views on a new approach.",
        "Michael Flynn, who was forced to resign as national security adviser amid controversy over his contacts with Russia\u2019s ambassador, collected nearly $68, 000 in fees and expenses from entities in 2015, a higher amount than was previously known, according to newly released documents. The records show that the bulk of the money, more than $45, 000, came from the Russian television network RT, in connection to a December 2015 trip Flynn took to Moscow.",
        "At least two sets of internal data that have been available to the Trump administration \u2014 but that have never been publicized \u2014 appear to undercut the government\u2019s argument for a travel ban that it had hoped would take effect Thursday, according to several officials familiar with the documents. One internal report, titled \u201cMost Violent Extremists Radicalized After Entering Homeland,\u201d analyzed roughly 90 cases involving suspected or confirmed terrorists, finding that most of them probably embraced extremist ideology after they arrived in the United States, not before.",
        "When Donald Trump recently laid a wreath at the tomb of Andrew Jackson, the 45th president was sending a message by choosing a hero. It is difficult to imagine that this selection was the result of vast reading in presidential history. Rather, it was the appropriation of Jackson as depicted on the $20 bill \u2014 the disrupter. The end of the effete, philosophical founding generation. The embodiment of a populism that venerated and served \u201cthe people. \u201d The avatar of American nationalism. This was, in fact, the way Jackson was viewed by many contemporaries, both supporters and detractors.",
        "The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away, but for governments it\u2019s not that easy. Once something is given \u2014 say, health insurance coverage to 20 million Americans \u2014 you take it away at your peril. This is true for any government benefit, but especially for health care. There\u2019s a reason not one Western democracy with some system of national health care has ever abolished it. The genius of the left is to keep enlarging the entitlement state by creating new giveaways that are politically impossible to repeal. For 20 years, Republicans railed against the New Deal.",
        "President Trump\u2019s first budget is an attempt to reshape the federal government in his own image \u2014 crass, bellicose, shortsighted, unserious and ultimately hollow. Unsurprisingly, Trump titled it \u201cAmerica First: A Budget Blueprint to Make America Great Again. \u201d The reality is that if Congress were to accept these numbers \u2014 which it can\u2019t possibly do \u2014 America would be made dumber, dirtier, hungrier and sicker. That may be Trump\u2019s idea of greatness, but it\u2019s certainly not mine. Would we at least be safer? I doubt it.",
        "Some people are complaining that the budget proffered by the Trump administration, despite its wonderful name, is too vague and makes all sorts of cuts to needed programs in favor of increasing military spending by leaps and bounds. These people are wimps. Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney has called it a \u201chard power budget\u201d which is, I think, the name of an exercise program where you eat only what you can catch, pump up your guns and then punch the impoverished in the face. This, conveniently, is also what the budget does.",
        "Sorry, poor people of America. Republicans are quietly sealing all the exits on the poverty trap. It\u2019s a process, in which officials at all levels of government are taking part: First, reduce poor women\u2019s access to the reproductive services they need to prevent unintended pregnancies, so they have less control over when, and with whom, they have children. Second, make it harder for any unexpectedly expecting women to have abortions. Third, make the adoption process more expensive, reducing incentives for other families to adopt the babies resulting from these unplanned pregnancies.",
        "GOVERNMENT WASTE is not a myth. Consider the overlap between President Trump\u2019s newly announced plan for federal spending and President Barack Obama\u2019s last proposed budget. Mr. Obama would have, as Mr. Trump would, eliminated several but dispensable programs, such as the Justice Department\u2019s State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, Agriculture\u2019s Water and Wastewater and Community Facilities Loan Guarantees and the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Targeted Air Shed Grants.",
        "The Republican proposal to overhaul the Affordable Care Act cleared a key hurdle Thursday, as the House Budget Committee narrowly voted to move it to the House floor and recommended a series of changes to the plan reflecting concerns from conservatives and centrists. All of the panel\u2019s Republicans and five Democrats supported a motion to change the system of tax credits created under the plan to ensure they are \u201cafforded to the population that they are intended to serve,\u201d an idea embraced across the ideological spectrum, including among centrists whose votes could be key.",
        "Luisa Fortin sometimes sits up at night, wondering what her clients are eating. She is the SNAP Outreach Coordinator for the Chattanooga Food Bank \u2014 but lately she has done less outreaching. Her families, working immigrants in northwest Georgia, are spooked by the political climate, Fortin said. Increasingly, she\u2019s being asked to explain how food stamps may impact immigration status, if not to outright cancel family food benefits. Since five of Fortin\u2019s families have withdrawn from the SNAP program. One, the single mother of three citizen daughters, had fled to Georgia to escape an abusive husband.",
        "Hours after a Florida prosecutor announced Thursday that she would not seek the death penalty in any cases, the state\u2019s governor said he was removing her from the prosecution of a man charged with killing an Orlando police officer. The intersection of two fraught topics \u2014 the shooting death of a police officer and capital punishment \u2014 gave way to a remarkably public showdown involving an elected state\u2019s attorney, Republican state officials and law enforcement leaders.",
        "Hi. Today\u2019s viral news story has been chosen, and it is this tweet from a verified corporate account run by McDonald\u2019s, the popular restaurant. Image, The Washington Post As you can clearly see in Exhibit A above, the tweet is a reply to President Trump, and it is not very nice to him. Whoever tweeted it really wanted to make sure that a lot of people saw it, which is why it was the \u201cpinned tweet\u201d for this account Thursday morning before it was deleted.",
        "Lockheed Martin said Thursday it has finished a laser system for the U. S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command and is preparing to hand it over to the Army for further testing. In initial tests, the company achieved 58 kilowatts of power but expects its laser to reach its full potential by the time of its delivery in the next few months. The laser is what the company calls a \u201ccombined fiber\u201d laser beam, bringing together individual lasers to form a single, stronger beam. Lockheed has been testing it at an installation in Bothell, Wash.",
        "\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d is enjoying its season in two decades, and it\u2019s going to finish it out by doing something the series has never done before: go live, coast to coast. Usually, SNL airs live on the East Coast at 11:30 p. m. and then broadcasts a taped delay for Mountain and Pacific time zones. But the final four episodes of this season will air simultaneously \u2014 meaning Californians get to watch SNL at 8:30 p. m.",
        "By the only evidence the NCAA tournament committee provided, Middle Tennessee State would not have made the bracket if not for winning the Conference USA tournament. The Blue Raiders were given a No. 12 seed; the highest any selection received was an 11. On its full seed list, the committee ranked the Blue Raiders 48th, below every . Had MTSU lost in the conference final, it apparently would have been judged \u2014 like every other school \u2014 as unworthy. Thursday afternoon, the Blue Raiders proved what a farce their exclusion would have been.",
        "BREAKING: A California man carrying Mace roamed for nearly 17 minutes inside the secured White House perimeter before he was taken into custody near the South Portico entrance, the Secret Service acknowledged Friday. Jonathan T. Tran, 26, of Milpitas, Calif. walked the grounds of the White House between 11:21 p. m. and 11:38 p. m. before being arrested, the Secret Service said in its statement. A laptop with sensitive security information on it was stolen from a Secret Service agent in New York City, law enforcement officials said Friday, prompting a multiagency investigation to try to retrieve it.",
        "President Trump refused to back off his unfounded allegations that former president Barack Obama last year wiretapped his phones in Trump Tower when asked about the subject during a joint news conference Friday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. After a German reporter asked Trump about the allegations, the president turned to Merkel and said \u201cas far as the wiretapping \u2026 by this past administration, at least we have something in common perhaps. \u201d Merkel was angered by reports in 2013 that the National Security Agency had tapped her phone in 2010 with the permission of Obama.",
        "The House Intelligence Committee did not reveal on Friday night the answer to the question of whether Justice Department documents substantiate President Trump\u2019s claim that he was wiretapped by the Obama administration, as he has claimed. The committee had asked for copies of any warrants, applications, or court orders relating to a wiretap of Trump or his surrogates and affiliates in advance of a Monday hearing at which the FBI and NSA directors are expected to testify about alleged connections between the Trump team and Russian authorities.",
        "The Trump administration filed court papers Friday hoping to salvage its second version of a travel ban, after two judges in separate cases this week found it likely violated the Constitution. The Justice Department filed legal papers in federal court in Maryland, setting up a new showdown in the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, located in Richmond. Earlier this week, federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland issued orders against the travel ban, finding it violated the First Amendment by disfavoring a particular religion.",
        "Washington Joan and Bernard Carl wanted a beautiful wedding for their oldest child. And for the most part, they got it. The lavish June 2015 celebration for 250 guests in the garden of their Southampton estate was gorgeous. The bride wore Oscar de la Renta. There were 3, 500 white roses individually studded into the lawn, a dinner beneath massive chandeliers of greenery and a wedding cake. The mother of the bride commissioned monogrammed napkins for each place setting, as well as a custom fabric for the tables and the flower girl\u2019s dress. There was a beachfront rehearsal dinner.",
        "The Trump administration proposed sweeping cuts to many parts of the federal government Thursday morning, including foreign aid, environmental protection, trade development, the arts and programs geared at helping the poor. But although many see these cuts as draconian, they still don\u2019t come close to fixing the country\u2019s budget problem. That\u2019s in part because the proposed cuts were all offset with increased spending on the military. But it\u2019s also because the blueprint the Trump administration issued Thursday focuses on just one part of federal spending. And as the Peter G.",
        "In rural Appalachia, people are so poor that there is a federal program dedicated to lifting them out of poverty. Through the Appalachian Regional Commission, the government pitches in on projects that these rural communities badly need but can\u2019t quite afford \u2014 everything from fixing roads, to building computer labs, to training workers, to opening health clinics. These efforts have become so widely admired that in recent years Congress launched, with bipartisan backing, sister agencies to help other rural regions stuck in generational cycles of poverty.",
        "Days after a report on federal student loans revealed a rise in defaults, President Trump\u2019s administration revoked federal guidance Thursday that barred student debt collectors from charging high fees on loans. [Student loan defaults are rising faster than you think] The Education Department is ordering guarantee agencies that collect on defaulted debt to disregard a memo former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration issued on the old federal lending program, known as the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program.",
        "So much for the forgotten men and women. Judging by President Trump\u2019s initial forays into economic policymaking, they would have been better off forgotten. \u201cThe forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,\u201d Trump vowed in his inaugural address. \u201cEveryone is listening to you now. \u201d They are? The Republican plan that Trump endorsed and the budget he just submitted cater more to the interests of the billionaires Trump chose for his Cabinet than to the rural and older voters who formed the backbone of his electoral support.",
        "\u201cThe world is laughing at us. They\u2019re laughing at the stupidity of our president. \u201d \u2014 Donald Trump, October 2016 Stupid is as stupid does. During the presidential campaign, Donald Trump remarked often on the stupidity of our leaders. He was under the impression that the rest of the planet was indulging in some sort of global guffaw at our expense. \u201cHow stupid are we? The world is laughing. \u201d If so, what must the mirthful world think of our current state of affairs?",
        "Mark Krikorian is executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies. Are you now, or have you ever been, a \u201chate group\u201d? This is the question at the heart of an attempt to delegitimize and suppress views regarding immigration held by a large share of the American public. Since 2007, the Southern Poverty Law Center has methodically added mainstream organizations critical of current immigration policy to its blacklist of \u201chate groups,\u201d including the Federation for American Immigration Reform, the Immigration Reform Law Institute and Californians for Population Stabilization, among others."
