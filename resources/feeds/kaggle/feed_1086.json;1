        "President Richard Nixon was in mode. He had just ordered special prosecutor Archibald Cox fired for refusing to back off his pursuit of the White House Watergate tapes. That very night, Nixon had accepted the resignation of Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson and fired Deputy Attorney General William D. Ruckelshaus, both of whom refused his instructions to discharge Cox. Nixon ordered Solicitor General Robert H. Bork, as the newly installed acting attorney general, to carry out the order, and he did. But the president wasn\u2019t finished.",
        "Kati Marton\u2019s latest book is \u201cTrue Believer: Stalin\u2019s Last American Spy. \u201d My daughter gave me a kit for Christmas. I dutifully spat in the vial provided and mailed the contents to ancestry. com. A few days ago, I received the shocking result: I am half European Jewish, half . This is surprising news, considering my sister recently did a similar test that found her to be of 89 percent European Jewish stock. How could two sisters be of such dramatically different ancestries? My Jewish half made perfect sense: My Hungarian mother and father were both Jewish.",
        "THE SPEED and enthusiasm with which two federal courts halted President Trump\u2019s latest travel executive order might suggest that the revised policy is as obviously problematic as the last, which was a sloppy rush job that the government poorly defended in court. In fact, the revised policy, while still more likely to harm than help national security, is legally far more defensible. Decades of precedent instruct judges to defer to the executive branch on immigration and national security matters such as this. It should surprise no one if the Supreme Court eventually allows the Trump administration to proceed.",
        "BEIRUT \u2014 U. S. drone aircraft fired missiles and dropped a bomb outside Aleppo on Thursday in an attack that the Pentagon said killed scores of militants but that local residents described as an assault on a mosque crowded with civilians. U. S. officials said the strikes in the town of Jinah had killed \u201cdozens\u201d of militants at a meeting of the terrorist group. But local activists and a monitoring group reported that at least 46 people died, and more were trapped under rubble, when the attack struck a mosque during a religious gathering.",
        "The Trump administration challenged China to do more to pull its ally North Korea back from the nuclear brink as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson bluntly declared Friday that the United States will do whatever is necessary to prevent a North Korean attack. \u201cAll options are on the table,\u201d Tillerson said in Seoul, where he underscored U. S. commitment to Asian allies threatened by North Korea and said he would lean on China during a visit there Saturday.",
        "President Trump the Capitol Hill dealmaker emerged Friday, playing hardball with uneasy GOP lawmakers as their leaders moved to push the Republican plan through the House next week. Trump won commitments of support from several members of the conservative Republican Study Committee after he endorsed two changes to the bill affecting Medicaid, the federal health program for the poor and disabled that would see $880 billion in cuts over the next decade under the pending GOP plan.",
        "A contingent of House Republicans is trying to push the nation\u2019s health insurance program for poor and vulnerable Americans deep into conservative territory, past a firewall that the Obama administration maintained for eight years. A partisan vote Thursday by the House Budget Committee would require adults to hold a job to qualify for Medicaid. That profound change has long been touted on the far right as a way to promote personal responsibility but opposed by Democrats who fear that it would deny health care to many people who need it most.",
        "The Justice Department will not support the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in a monumental court battle over whether the structure of the federal watchdog is unconstitutional, according to court documents filed Friday. The department also argued that the president should be able to remove the director of the independent agency at will, a shift that consumer advocates say could threaten the independent nature of the CFPB. Under the Act that created the agency, the director can be removed only for cause \u2014 setting a high bar for a president who wants to put new leadership in place.",
        "President Trump on Friday said he has \u201cstrong support\u201d for NATO and declared he is not an \u201cisolationist\u201d on free trade. But he emphasized during a White House summit with German Chancellor Angela Merkel that member nations must contribute their \u201cfair share\u201d to support the security alliance. At a joint news conference, Trump said some NATO countries owe \u201cvast sums\u201d in dues, which is \u201cvery unfair to the United States\u201d \u2014 an allegation that appeared based on an incomplete understanding of how the alliance is funded.",
        "Before he took office, Donald Trump said he would not accept his presidential salary. An aide said he would donate the money instead. The Trump Organization \u2014 the president\u2019s global real estate and branding business \u2014 pledged not to keep any profits that it made by renting hotel rooms and banquet halls to foreign governments. Those proceeds, Trump\u2019s attorney said, would be given to the U. S. treasury. And the committee that raised a record $90 million for Trump\u2019s inauguration pledged that, after running a celebration, the remaining funds would be given to charity.",
        "\u201cWe want to give you money for programs that don\u2019t work. I can\u2019t defend that anymore. \u201d \u2014 White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, press briefing, March 16 There has been a lot of media criticism of Mulvaney for suggesting that the popular Meals and Wheels program does not work or is \u201cjust not showing results. \u201d But, because of tweets and snippets posted on the Web, it appears his comments have been misinterpreted.",
        "The day began with a mildly offensive Irish cliche in front of a roomful of Irish people, and it all went downhill from there. \u201cTop of the morning,\u201d said Vice President Pence, as he hosted Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny at his residence for breakfast Thursday. Really? The reaction by Irish on social media was palpable. \u201cLiterally just shouted \u2018NOBODY SAYS THAT\u2019 at the TV,\u201d a journalist in Ireland tweeted. \u201cI\u2019ve literally only ever heard that said by Americans,\u201d another person said. \u201cHow do all the Irish people not just go, \u2018Nope,\u2019 and leave the room?\u201d tweeted another.",
        "The NCAA tournament barely had a chance to meet Oklahoma State, but it will miss the Cowboys dearly. Jawun Evans pushed the pace at warp speed and got to the rim whenever the mood struck. Coach Brad Underwood asked only one thing of his offense, and it was to go faster. Jeffrey Carroll forgot how to miss shots. Collectively, they stuck to their general defensive philosophy of conscientious objection, which enabled Michigan to unleash its own barrage. In its cameo, Oklahoma State delivered the kind of game the NCAA tournament needed.",
        "(Erik Simander) \u201cThe death of one partner before the other \u2014 is inevitable, and the subject is maybe a bit taboo. No one likes to talk about it, but it happens. \u201d Simander When a loved one dies it can create a painful void in our lives. I know this because several years ago my father died. He was not yet 70 years old. His sudden loss was devastating to me and my family. On top of the shock of losing our father, we were also left with a kind of empty feeling.",
        "Inside the White House, they are dismissed by their rivals as \u201cthe Democrats. \u201d Outspoken, worldly and polished, this coterie of ascendant Manhattan business advisers is scrambling the power centers swirling around President Trump. Led by Gary Cohn and Dina Powell \u2014 two former Goldman Sachs executives often aligned with Trump\u2019s eldest daughter and his \u2014 the group and its broad network of allies are the targets of suspicion, loathing and jealousy from their more ideological West Wing colleagues.",
        "A prudent president, facing multiple battles on legislative and other priorities that are crucial to his success, would find ways to avoid needless controversy. Not President Trump. He\u2019s doing exactly the opposite, and the credibility gap continues to grow. The House Republican leadership\u2019s proposal to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which Trump has embraced, faces serious opposition within the party. The president\u2019s newly proposed budget, which would slash domestic discretionary spending, the State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, has been met with stiff resistance, even among some Republicans.",
        "Fresh off the heels of a with Britain, President Trump attacked another key ally \u2014 Germany. At a news conference Friday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Trump \u201creiterated\u201d his \u201cneed for our NATO allies to pay their fair share for the cost of defense. \u201d He followed up Saturday with an impolitic tweet shot, writing that Germany owes America \u201cvast sums of money\u201d for NATO. And, he argued, the country should pay more \u201cfor the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides.",
        "Chuck Berry, the perpetual wild man of rock music who helped define its rebellious spirit in the 1950s and was the sly poet laureate of songs about girls, cars, school and even the \u201cany old way you choose it\u201d vitality of the music itself, died March 18 at at his home in St. Charles County, Mo. He was 90. St. Charles County police announced the death in a Facebook post on its Website, saying officers responded to a medical emergency at Mr. Berry\u2019s home and administered lifesaving techniques but could not revive him. No further information was available.",
        "It was a before one of the sparsely attended committee hearings that take place almost every day on Capitol Hill \u2014 in this case, a session on energy infrastructure so dry it would not merit even the presence of a camera. But in Al Franken\u2019s suite of offices in the Hart Senate Office Building, the man still known best as one of the early stars of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d was going through an intense rehearsal with four aides. How much, Franken wanted to know, are the Chinese spending on clean technology research?",
        "President Trump is a guy. He made his fortune in cities and keeps his family in a Manhattan tower. But when Trump talks about cities, he presents a fearsome caricature that bears little resemblance to the real urban landscape. \u201cOur inner cities are a disaster,\u201d he declared in a campaign debate. \u201cYou get shot walking to the store. They have no education. They have no jobs.",
        "Rep. Steve King\u2019s tweet this past week in defense of Geert Wilders, the Dutch politician, won the Iowa Republican praise from white supremacists but a from his colleagues. \u201cWilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny,\u201d King wrote. \u201cWe can\u2019t restore our civilization with somebody else\u2019s babies. \u201d Jeff Kaufmann, the Iowa Republican chairman, appeared to speak for the consensus in answering the notion that children of parents are not quite American. \u201cWe are a nation of immigrants, and diversity is the strength of any nation and any community,\u201d Kaufmann said.",
        "House Speaker Paul Ryan received a considerable dose of criticism for his comment that \u201cthe fatal conceit of Obamacare\u201d is that \u201cthe people who are healthy pay for the people who are sick. \u201d \u201cThis is literally how all insurance works,\u201d Charles Pierce wrote for Esquire, calling Ryan a \u201crube. \u201d The Huffington Post offered a lesson in \u201cInsurance 101\u201d for Ryan, explaining that \u201cyounger people, who tend to be healthier than older people, pay for health insurance like everyone else.",
        "When WikiLeaks released more than 8, 000 files about the CIA\u2019s global hacking programs this month, it dropped a tantalizing clue: The leak came from private contractors. Federal investigators quickly confirmed this, calling contractors the likeliest sources. As a result of the breach, WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange said, the CIA had \u201clost control of its entire cyberweapons arsenal. \u201d Intelligence insiders were dismayed. Agencies \u201ctake a chance with contractors\u201d because \u201cthey may not have the same loyalty\u201d as officers employed by the government, former CIA director Leon Panetta lamented to NBC.",
        "A small portion of President Trump\u2019s 2005 tax return is now publicly available. These two pages are more cipher than information. Without the numerous pages of supporting schedules, it is hard to know why Trump was able to claim more than $103 million in losses, offsetting much of the $153 million in income he reported. But one thing is clear: The vast majority of the taxes he and his wife paid that year were a result of the alternative minimum tax. Without it, Trump would have owed just $5 million to the government. The AMT added $31 million.",
        "Steven A. Cook, the Eni Enrico Mattei senior fellow for Middle East and Africa studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, is the author of \u201cFalse Dawn: Protest, Democracy, and Violence in the New Middle East. \u201d Turkey and the Netherlands warred this past week \u2014 expelling and barring diplomats \u2014 over whether Turkish officials could campaign among expatriate Turks for an illiberal new constitution. Turkey has long been an important ally of the West, but despite all the diplomatic, political and military links, Americans understand very little about it.",
        "Germany \u2014 The Trump administration on Saturday rejected a statement from other leading economies that warned against the perils of trade protectionism, the latest sign of how the administration\u2019s more combative approach to diplomacy could create rifts with U. S. allies and leave traditional partners in the dark about the direction of U. S. policy.",
        "As the Trump administration advanced plans to erect a wall on the southern border, the leader of Mexico\u2019s national governors association said Saturday in Washington that President Trump\u2019s budget proposal proves that U. S. taxpayers will foot the bill. Trump has insisted that he will force Mexico to pay for the wall, but Mexican officials have refused. The president\u2019s budget request Thursday included $2. 6 billion, mostly for first stages of the wall. \u201cTrump is asking the Americans to pay for the wall,\u201d Gov.

        "The arrest of a Salisbury, Md. man accused of giving a journalist a seizure by sending him a flashing image online represents a new kind of prosecution for a new kind of crime. The journalist, Newsweek\u2019s Kurt Eichenwald, suffered a seizure in Dallas after viewing the flashing animation when he received it via Twitter late last year, according to a statement from the Justice Department. Eichenwald had written about his epilepsy and publicly described a similar attack several weeks before the Dec.",
        "Sen. Joni Ernst sat on the stage at Coe College in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, nothing but a table and a few bottles of water between her and an of constituent angst. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). (Susan ) The chilliest response came after a question about Betsy DeVos, who was confirmed as education secretary in a historic tiebreaking vote by Vice President Mike Pence. In the vote, two Republicans voted with the 48 Democrats, saying they didn\u2019t think DeVos was qualified for the job."
