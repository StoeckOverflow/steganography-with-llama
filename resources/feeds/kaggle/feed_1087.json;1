        "President Trump\u2019s 2018 budget proposal is unabashed in its goal: slashing or eradicating a number of social and research programs to offset new spending on defense and homeland security. That emphasis quickly met with broad criticism, including from some who pointed out an apparent contradiction. Trump places a heavy emphasis on cutting waste and targets for elimination programs that, in some cases, cost the government only a few million dollars a year.",
        "Jake Tapper went on Bill Maher\u2019s HBO show Friday night and spoke at length about how the media covers and should cover President Trump. Tapper has emerged as the conscience of cable news in recent weeks, unafraid to bluntly call out Trump and his team\u2019s falsehoods and other strange conduct. Just hours before the HBO interview, Tapper said on his CNN show that it was \u201can embarrassment\u201d for White House press secretary Sean Spicer to recite a Fox News analyst\u2019s claim that British intelligence spied on Trump for President Obama. (Britain is understandably unhappy about the claim.) .",
        "When Kevin Breen first complained about feeling achy and tired, his wife couldn\u2019t help but wonder whether he was trying to wiggle out of a busy day of family responsibilities. It was Christmas Day, and Breen \u2014 an active whose idea of relaxing is going water skiing on Lake Michigan or playing pickup basketball \u2014 is rarely short on energy. But the Grand Rapids, Mich. resident insisted he really was feeling ill.",
        "GREENVILLE, S. C. \u2014 Shortly before 11 p. m. on Friday, without a hint of ceremony, it happened: Greenville, this charming little city on the banks of the Reedy River, became the epicenter of Duke hatred. The Blue Devils don\u2019t always need help in this department, of course. During this year\u2019s NCAA tournament, they are the East Region\u2019s No. 2 seed and a trendy pick to reach yet another Final Four. They are the bluest of basketball\u2019s blue bloods at an elite private university. They have a couple proper villains in Coach Mike Krzyzewski and guard Grayson Allen.",
        "We held tightly to each other, crying as we said goodbye. It had been a passionate three years, but we\u2019d reached an impasse: I wanted a child, and he didn\u2019t. Our friends assured us we\u2019d made the right decision. \u201cWhat a Peter Pan. 35 years old and just wants to play. Grow up or get out,\u201d mine quipped. \u201cDude, you live for adventure. You\u2019re not the white picket fence type. If you stayed, you\u2019d have resented her,\u201d his reasoned. Six months later, I doubted our decision to break up.",
        "Even when you try your best to eat well, it\u2019s difficult to know everything about nutrition. I often talk with clients who believe they are making good choices and don\u2019t realize that little oversights stand in their way of optimal health. Here\u2019s a top 10 list of common but nutrition mistakes. You add whole flaxseeds to your breakfast Flaxseeds are filled with fats, fiber and lignans (antioxidants) which all benefit heart health. But whole flaxseeds may pass through the intestines undigested, which means you\u2019ll miss out on the health benefits inside the seed.",
        "The rumble of a jet engine is a comforting sound to some air travelers, making it easy to sleep on virtually any flight. For others, just the thought of being trapped in a pressurized aluminum tube is enough to send massive doses of adrenaline into their bloodstreams, ensuring alertness for days. Pamela Wagner falls somewhere in the middle. Though not a flier, she says the noise makes rest impossible. \u201cI\u2019m used to super silence when I\u2019m sleeping,\u201d she says. \u201cNot exactly what you get on a flight. \u201d True.",
        "The political appointee charged with keeping watch over Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt and his aides has offered unsolicited advice so often that after just four weeks on the job, Pruitt has shut him out of many staff meetings, according to two senior administration officials. At the Pentagon, they\u2019re privately calling the former Marine officer and fighter pilot who\u2019s supposed to keep his eye on Defense Secretary Jim Mattis \u201cthe commissar,\u201d according to a defense official with knowledge of the situation.",
        "BEIJING \u2014 While his boss was goading China over Twitter, new Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has been trying to build a constructive and \u201c \u201d relationship with the leadership in Beijing. And though his warnings about the possibility of eventual military action over North Korea have raised hackles here, Tillerson received a warm welcome from China\u2019s president on Sunday. \u201cYou have made a lot of active efforts to achieve a smooth transition in our relationship under the new era,\u201d President Xi Jinping told Tillerson as the men sat down for talks in the Great Hall of the People.",
        "The Republican chairman and ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said Sunday thatnew documents provided to Congress by the Justice Department provided no proof to support President Trump\u2019s claim that his predecessor had ordered wiretaps of Trump Tower. \u201cWas there a physical wiretap of Trump Tower? No, but there never was, and the information we got on Friday continues to lead us in that direction,\u201d Rep. Devin Nunes ( .) the chairman, said on \u201cFox News Sunday.",
        "FBI Director James B. Comey and Adm. Mike Rogers, director of the NSA, will appear Monday before the House Intelligence Committee to speak about alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, including potential connections between President Trump\u2019s inner circle and the Kremlin. It is the first time Comey and Rogers have testified publicly since Trump took office two months ago \u2014 a period during which Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned and Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from investigations.",
        "The schools superintendent in Harrisonburg, Va. was meeting parents this month when a mother broke down in tears, explaining that she was undocumented. What would the school do, she asked, if she became separated from her children? \u201cI remember walking up to her and putting my arm on her shoulder and saying, \u2018Your child is safe at our school,\u2019 \u201d said Scott Kizner, the city schools chief.

        "On Jan. 9, the Russian dissident Vladi mir celebrated a signal victory in a long campaign to hold Vladi mir Putin\u2019s regime accountable for its human rights crimes.

Alexander Bastrykin, a close Putin confidant who heads the state investigative committee \u2014 the instrument used to persecute opposition activists with criminal charges.",
        "The emerging Trump foreign policy doctrine might be summed up this way: escalate to . During his visit to Tokyo last week, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made news by promising a new approach to North Korea following what he called decades of failed diplomacy. Increased pressure on the North Korean regime and its Chinese enablers is coming, he said, and a preemptive military strike on Pyongyang is not off the table. Less noticed in his news conference was Tillerson\u2019s prediction about the future of American intervention overseas.",
        "President Trump might do the world a perverse favor. Voters in Western Europe appear to be looking at what America has brought upon itself and deciding: \u201cWe sure as heck don\u2019t want to go there. \u201d And Trump\u2019s bizarre performance at a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday did nothing to change that. The moment came after the Netherlands slapped back the far right in its elections last week. The forces of tolerance and openness bent but didn\u2019t break.",
        "It\u2019s time to take control of Medicaid before it takes control of us. Unless we act \u2014 and there is little evidence that we will \u2014 Medicaid increasingly becomes another mechanism by which government skews spending toward the old and away from the young. In the raging debate over the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) this is a subject that neither Republicans nor Democrats dare touch. It\u2019s an ominous omission that obscures the overhaul Medicaid really needs. Medicaid is the sleeping giant of U. S. health care. Created in 1965, it provides health insurance for the very poor.",
        "Brian Leiter is a professor at the University of Chicago Law School. Ordinary Americans may be understandably perplexed by the controversy over nominating a judge to the highest court in the land. Isn\u2019t appointing a top judge like appointing a top chemist? You want someone technically competent and professionally responsible, and that is all. But all lawyers and all political insiders making the choices know that is not so.",
        "THE MEASURED warming of the planet is not hypothetical. Nor are its effects, which are happening now, not decades from now. An ecological catastrophe is unfolding off Australia\u2019s coast: Humans are killing the Great Barrier Reef, one of the world\u2019s greatest natural wonders, and there\u2019s nothing Australians on their own can do about it. We are all responsible. An ocean water temperature spike last year caused a massive \u201cbleaching\u201d event, in which colorful corals turned an antiseptic, sickly white. Scientists believe that the reef will never be the same.",
        "The Republican plan moving rapidly toward a crucial House vote this week is likely to be changed to give older Americans more assistance to buy insurance, House Speaker Paul D.

        "When Judge Neil Gorsuch arrives on Capitol Hill on Monday morning to begin his confirmation hearings for a seat on the Supreme Court, he will give President Trump his first chance to make a lasting imprint on the federal judiciary \u2014 and Republicans a fresh test to work their will now that they control all of Washington\u2019s levers of power.",
        "Some people regard Tomi Lahren as a racist. The star\u2019s past commentary on the conservative website the Blaze, including her disparagement of the Black Lives Matter movement, caused her to be booed when she appeared last year on Trevor Noah\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show. \u201d Noah acknowledged that \u2014 even as he urged his progressive audience to be polite to his guest: \u201cImagine you\u2019re at Thanksgiving again and your racist uncle walked in. \u201d But President Trump seems to like her style.",

        "In a remarkable statement last week, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson declared that \u201cthe political and diplomatic efforts of the past 20 years to bring North Korea to the point of denuclearization have failed. \u201d Shortly afterward, in response to joint military exercises being conducted by the United States and South Korea, the North Korean government held a news conference and declared that \u201cthe situation is already on the brink of nuclear war. \u201d The threat of nuclear war, mostly background noise for the past 25 years, is alarming.",
        "President Trump\u2019s Saturday tweet accusing Germany of owing the United States \u201cvast sums of money\u201d for NATO might have been an attempt to put pressure on the European ally. But Berlin has rejected his claim while also questioning his understanding of NATO finances. On Sunday, German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen called the criticism \u201cinaccurate,\u201d without mentioning the president\u2019s name. \u201cNATO does not have a debt account,\u201d von der Leyen said, according to her ministry. In reality, NATO has only a small logistical budget, which relies on funding by all member states.",
        "Robert Gilbeau is in a heap of legal trouble. In June, he became the first Navy admiral in modern history to be convicted of a felony. Next month, he faces sentencing and could land in federal prison for up to five years. Yet the disgraced officer can count on one thing: a military pension that pays him about $10, 000 a month. He collected his first check last fall.",
        "It was girls\u2019 day out, and Diana Carrillo had abandoned her desire to eat healthy well before she, her sister and two friends got to the Southern California restaurant. The destination: Saint Marc, an upscale spot in the seaside city of Huntington Beach, where Carrillo had been once before. As the waiter walked up to the table, Carrillo figured she\u2019d splurge on the sandwich and pay the $2 to add some of the restaurant\u2019s signature bacon. To start, maybe she\u2019d share a watermelon and cheese plate with her sister and friends.",
        "One week ago, for one halcyon hour, the Atlantic Coast Conference lorded over college basketball. The NCAA tournament committee awarded the league nine bids, more than any conference in the country, a nod to their perceived superiority all winter. And then the tournament began, and from literally the first night, the ACC has done almost nothing but watch its teams depart, often in unsightly fashion. The ACC\u2019s embarrassing opening weekend continued apace in Sunday\u2019s first game, as Louisville, the Midwest\u2019s second seed, suffered a loss to Michigan.",
        "FBI Director James B. Comey acknowledged Monday that his agency is conducting an investigation into possible coordination between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign in a counterintelligence probe that could reach all the way to the White House and may last for months.
