        "On the 60th day of his presidency came the hardest truth for Donald Trump. He was wrong. James B. Comey \u2014 the FBI director whom Trump celebrated on the campaign trail as a gutsy and honorable \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d \u2014 testified under oath Monday what many Americans had already assumed: Trump had falsely accused his predecessor of wiretapping his headquarters during last year\u2019s campaign. Trump did not merely allege that former president Barack Obama ordered surveillance on Trump Tower, of course. He asserted it as fact, and then reasserted it, and then insisted that forthcoming evidence would prove him right.",
        "With the House Intelligence Committee on Monday prepared to hold hearings on Russian influence in the 2016 election, the president issued tweets that did not hold up well as the testimony unfolded. James Clapper and others stated that there is no evidence Potus colluded with Russia. This story is FAKE NEWS and everyone knows it! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 20, 2017 The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign. Big advantage in Electoral College & lost! \u2014 Donald J.",
        "On Monday, unsubstantiated claims that President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower during last year\u2019s presidential campaign, substantiated claims about Russia\u2019s meddling in the U. S. election to help Trump win, and cloudy claims about Trump associates\u2019 ties to Russia all came to a head. FBI Director James B. Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers testified before the House Intelligence Committee in a rare public hearing about what they know and what they want to know.",
        "Judge Neil Gorsuch promised to remember the \u201cmodest station we judges are meant to occupy in a democracy\u201d if he is elevated to the nation\u2019s highest court, as the hearing on his Supreme Court nomination began Monday amidst Democratic doubts about his impartial ity and lingering resentment over the circumstances of his selection. The day followed a familiar confirmation hearing script \u2014 glowing assessments from senators of the party whose president made the nomination, vows of scrutiny from senators out of power and a humble, deferential opening statement from the nominee. But there was a difference as well.",
        "This would be a good time to do something about the red menace of Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. Instead, we\u2019re talking about the Red Raiders of Texas Tech. FBI Director James B. Comey, testifying Monday about his agency\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s attempt to tilt the 2016 election to Donald Trump, explained why it was \u201ca fairly easy judgment\u201d that Trump was Putin\u2019s favored candidate: \u201cPutin hated Secretary Clinton so much that the flip side of that coin was he had a clear preference for the person running against the person he hated so much. \u201d But Rep. K.",
        "If your NCAA tournament bracket has collapsed, it is good to be able to take a break and contemplate something else that is more of a shambles. So we in The Post\u2019s Opinions section have gone out and found you some of the finest quotes in all the land: an alternative bracket with the most quotes there are. It is time we asked the question: What is the quintessential quote of the Trump administration? What phrase captures its peculiar, ineffable essence? Is it \u201calternative facts\u201d?",
        "It is difficult to overestimate the geopolitical risks of this moment \u2014 or the (both disturbed and eager) global scrutiny now being given to the American president. Aggression is growing along the westward reach of Russian influence and the southern boundary of Chinese influence. Intercontinental nuclear capacity may soon be in the hands of a mental pubescent in North Korea.",
        "The uncertain future of Obamacare isn\u2019t just wreaking havoc for insurers, hospitals and other companies in the ecosystem. It\u2019s paralyzing the lives of millions of regular Americans, too. These are people who have made major, life decisions contingent on the system we have today \u2014 including a functioning individual insurance market and the subsidies to make those individual insurance plans affordable. I spoke recently with about a dozen Americans from around the country who worry the rug is about to be pulled from under them.",
        "It is a story and, at first, quite moving. It is the story of Marty Bannon, father of the White House chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, and how he lost much of his nest egg when the financial system cratered in 2008. He had worked for AT&T for 50 years, buying the stock when it was as safe as gold (only gold paid no dividend) and was now watching it go south at such an alarming rate that he decided to sell it. In a flash, the system turned on Marty and a lifetime of savings was gone.",
        "A HOUSE Intelligence Committee hearing Monday produced the remarkable spectacle of FBI Director James B. Comey publicly testifying that there was \u201cno information that supports\u201d tweets by President Trump alleging wiretapping of his New York headquarters on the order of President Barack Obama. It saw National Security Agency Director Michael S. Rogers agree with the British government that it was \u201cutterly ridiculous\u201d for the White House to suggest that such surveillance had been undertaken by Britain\u2019s signals agency. And it produced official confirmation by Mr. Comey that the agency is investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the U. S.",
        "House Republican leaders, racing toward a planned Thursday vote on their proposed overhaul, appeared to overcome a major obstacle Monday when the leader of a key group of conservatives said the bloc would not take a formal position against the bill. The House Freedom Caucus has threatened for weeks to tank the legislation drafted by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) arguing that it does not do enough to undo the Affordable Care Act. If the group of roughly three dozen GOP members opposed the bill, it could block its passage. But Rep. Mark Meadows ( .",
        "You should know a couple of things before we embark on a recap of \u201cSesame Street\u2019s\u201d surprisingly vicious takedowns of Donald Trump, which span three decades leading up to his political rise. First: Trump is most often depicted as a grouch \u2014 unpleasant monsters who base their culture and economy around garbage. So when \u201cDonald Grump\u201d appears in a 2005 episode as a badly toupeed muppet \u201cwhose name equals trash,\u201d that\u2019s not necessarily an insult.",
        "Homeland Security officials on Monday unveiled the administration\u2019s first list of law enforcement agencies that refused to detain jailed immigrants beyond their release dates so that the federal government could take them into custody and try to deport them. Federal officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in a conference call with reporters, said local agencies, including some in Maryland and Virginia, failed to honor 206 detention requests from Jan. 28 to Feb. 3.",
        "David Rockefeller Sr. the heir to a vast and storied family fortune who, as president, chairman and chief executive of Chase Manhattan Bank, transformed a listless business into one of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions, died March 20 at his home in Pocantico Hills, N. Y. He was 101. A spokesman, Fraser P. Seitel, said the cause was congestive heart failure. Dr. Rockefeller was the last surviving grandchild of oil baron John D. Rockefeller, who became one of the richest men in the world by the time he died in 1937.",
        "He\u2019s been called lots of things: chief, deputy chief, officer, husband, son, dad, immigrant, American. But none of those titles mattered when Hassan Aden landed on U. S. soil earlier this month in Trump\u2019s America. All that mattered was that his name is Hassan. And that, apparently, was enough for U. S. Customs and Border Protection officers to question everything else about Aden\u2019s life. Aden, 52, is a retired Greenville, N. C. police chief and a former deputy chief with the Alexandria police in Virginia.",
        "Her daughter had been missing for about a month when Maria Reyes hacked into the \u2019s Facebook account and discovered the death threats. \u201cThose guys want to kill you,\u201d warned one private message in Spanish. \u201cThey have already given permission to take you out. \u201d \u201cGet ready,\u201d said another. The profiles of the people making the threats featured skulls, guns, coffins and gang signs that Reyes immediately recognized as emblems of Mara Salvatrucha, better known as .

        "\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Dianne Hull remembered her friend Vicky Weinstein asking, alarm evident in her voice. The two women had just finished lunch in December 2012, and Hull breathed heavily as she walked across the kitchen of her friend\u2019s home. Hull\u2019s audible breathing \u2014 and increasing breathlessness \u2014 had been shoved aside in her constellation of pressing concerns. For months, Hull had been focused on a medical crisis affecting her young son.",
        "President Trump spent Tuesday selling the Republican overhaul to skeptical House members, warning his party that failure would endanger his legislative agenda and their own political careers. But more than two dozen GOP lawmakers remained firmly opposed to the legislation amid the persuasion campaign led by Trump and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) \u2014 more than enough to block the bill ahead of a planned Thursday vote.",
        "There was once a time \u2014 before the investigations, before the sexual abuse conviction \u2014 when rich and famous men loved to hang around with Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire money manager who loved to party. They visited his mansion in Palm Beach, Fla. They flew on his jet to join him at his private estate on the Caribbean island of Little Saint James. They even joked about his taste in younger women. President Trump called Epstein a \u201cterrific guy\u201d back in 2002, saying that \u201che\u2019s a lot of fun to be with.",
        "KIEV, Ukraine \u2014 A Ukrainian lawmaker released new financial documents Tuesday allegedly showing that a former campaign chairman for President Trump laundered payments from the party of a disgraced of Ukraine using offshore accounts in Belize and Kyrgyzstan. The new documents, if legitimate, stem from business ties between the Trump aide, Paul Manafort, and the party of former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, who enjoyed Moscow\u2019s backing while he was in power. He has been in hiding in Russia since being overthrown by protesters in 2014, and is wanted in Ukraine on corruption charges.",
        "Fox News has reportedly pulled legal analyst Andrew Napolitano from the air over his baseless claim, repeated by President Trump, that British intelligence officials spied on Trump at the request of President Barack Obama. Napolitano, a regular face on Fox News, has not appeared on the network since Thursday and will not be a guest in the near future, the Los Angeles Times and the Associated Press reported Monday, citing anonymous individuals. A Fox News spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment Monday night.",
        "Judge Neil Gorsuch stressed his independence and defended the integrity of the federal judiciary Tuesday as the Senate hearings on his Supreme Court nomination turned on the search for his judicial philosophy and what one senator called \u201cthe elephant in the room\u201d \u2014 President Trump.",
        "Judge Neil Gorsuch did not think much of the original line of attack that Democrats drew up to go after his nomination to the Supreme Court. He laughed at the very idea that he lacked the independence from President Trump to serve on the high court. \u201cThat\u2019s a softball question, Mr. Chairman,\u201d Gorsuch told Sen. Charles E. Grassley ( ) the Judiciary Committee chief.",
        "Susan E. Rice was national security adviser from 2013 to 2017 and U. S. permanent representative to the United Nations from 2009 to 2013. Last week, the British intelligence agency GCHQ took the rare step of debunking as \u201cutterly ridiculous\u201d the Trump administration\u2019s insinuation that Britain spied on Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign. On Monday, FBI Director James B. Comey testified plainly that \u201cI have no information that supports\u201d President Trump\u2019s accusations that his predecessor ordered the \u201cwires tapped\u201d at Trump Tower.",
        "The nomination of Neil Gorsuch presents the Senate with a constitutional dilemma: Is this nation prepared to have Eddie Haskell serving a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court? The most noteworthy thing to emerge from Gorsuch\u2019s testimony Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee wasn\u2019t his judicial philosophy (conservative) his credentials (considerable) nor even the likelihood of confirmation (virtually certain). What stood out was his manner: Gorsuch played a folksy sycophant straight out of the 1950s.",
        "Watching the Senate confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, one might easily find oneself wishing Gorsuch were president of the United States. Alas, he\u2019s not. But Gorsuch\u2019s selection to replace Antonin Scalia is the sanest act committed by a president whose first 60 days have left him with an approval rating under 40 percent and persistent questions about his stability. President Trump should be sending champagne to Gorsuch \u2014 for life \u2014 for projecting enough grace to benefit those who haven\u2019t a knack for it.",
        "What a world. I spend an evening looking at a friend\u2019s video he shot in Uganda, impoverished people dancing with hands over their heads, overjoyed that a well has been dug and they can drink good water without having to hike for miles. The next day I read about a foundation grant to create storytelling programs in small towns to create radical reimaginings of narratives that lead to healing. And then the Boy President is on TV with Angela Merkel looking at him and thinking, \u201cWho is that old host standing at the lectern?",
        "The House Intelligence Committee hearing Monday marked the end of the opening installment of \u201cThe President,\u201d the show that has transfixed the nation and the world. Now the plot gets more serious, perhaps darker, with some new characters likely to emerge in key roles. President Trump should be less of a stage hog going forward, and his Twitter storms less intense. He is often described as a narcissist, but he\u2019s not suicidal. He knows he has been rebuffed in a public hearing that he can\u2019t ridicule as \u201cfake news.",
        "THE TRUMP administration s mindless attempt to scrap federal funding to clean up the Chesapeake Bay is a stroll down   lane. Heedless of recent history, the administration s proposed budget would, at a swipe, reopen the door to the degradation of the United States  largest estuary and reverse important recent progress in restoring the water, fish, oysters, crabs and tourism that make the bay so vibrant.  It was just six years ago that a third of the bay",
        "The order has been issued for the immediate construction of a Mexico border wall. The specs have been outlined: 30 feet high and \u201caesthetically pleasing. \u201d The next thing on President Trump\u2019s list for building his \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d: Hire more lawyers for a long and expensive battle over private land. The wall will cost a lot more \u2014 politically and economically \u2014 than Trump has publicly acknowledged."
