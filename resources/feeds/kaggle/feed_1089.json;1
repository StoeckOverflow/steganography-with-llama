        "A small San Francisco clothing retailer has lodged a class action suit against Ivanka Trump\u2019s brand, charging that it has an unfair business edge because President Trump, his daughter and his aides have leveraged the presidency to promote its products.

The U. K. ban applies to six countries, while the U. S. ban applies to 10 airports in eight countries. Fliers can still travel with these items, but they must be packed in their checked baggage on U.

Salam Mukhaibir\u2019s death this month, along with four other Yazidi fighters, marked the latest dark turn for an Iraqi minority sect that has suffered genocide at the hands of the Islamic State.

Jordan Price hadn\u2019t planned to fight. The and his older brother had signed up as a joke. But it was too late to back out now. Price insisted to friends that he wasn\u2019t nervous, but he sounded as though he were convincing himself. He hadn\u2019t even trained, a choice his anxious eyes indicated he\u2019d now begun to regret at least a little. Then a shout of encouragement broke his concentration.",

        "The Republican overhaul spearheaded by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and backed by President Trump suffered a significant setback Wednesday, as personal appeals by both the president and vice president failed to sway conservatives to back the bill.

While Rep.",
        "House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes went to the White House on Wednesday afternoon to personally brief President Trump about intelligence he says he has seen regarding surveillance of foreign nationals during the presidential transition. The surveillance could have inadvertently picked up the president or members of his transition team, the chairman said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve read seems to me to be some level of surveillance activity, perhaps legal. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s right,\u201d Nunes said to reporters outside the White House. \u201cI don\u2019t know that the American people would be comfortable with what I\u2019ve read.",

Secret Service requested $60 million in additional funding for the next year, offering the most precise estimate yet of the escalating costs for travel and protection resulting from the unusually complicated lifestyle of the Trump family, according to internal agency documents reviewed by The Washington Post. Nearly half of the additional money, $26. 8 million, would pay to protect President Trump\u2019s family and private home in New York\u2019s Trump Tower, the documents show, while $33 million would be spent on travel costs incurred by \u201cthe president, vice president and other visiting heads of state.",

        "With a shrewdly calculated innocence, Judge Neil Gorsuch told a big fat lie at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday. Because it was a lie everyone expected, nobody called it that. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a Republican judge or a Democratic judge,\u201d Gorsuch said. Gorsuch, the amiable veteran of many Republican campaigns, is to know how serious a fib that was. As Sen.

        "Seeking and winning the presidency has been a magical voyage of discovery for Donald Trump. Tuesday night, he divulged a most remarkable finding: Abraham Lincoln was \u2014 are you sitting down for this? \u2014 a Republican. \u201cMost people don\u2019t even know he was a Republican,\u201d Trump told a group of Republicans. \u201cRight?

Democrats said the same sorts of things about Merrick Garland, the judge President Barack Obama nominated more than a year ago, whom Mr. McConnell blocked in a cynical power play. In fact, Democrats had more reason to complain: More than Mr.",

Moments after President Trump suggested on Friday that Fox News commentator Andrew Napolitano had validated the unfounded claim that President Barack Obama had recruited British agents to bug Trump Tower during the campaign, Smith stepped in to say otherwise. \u201cFox News cannot confirm Judge Napolitano\u2019s commentary,\u201d said Smith, the network\u2019s chief news anchor. \u201cFox News knows of no evidence of any kind that the of the United States was surveilled at any time, in any way. \u201d And perhaps to drive home the point, Smith added, \u201cFull stop.",

Seven years after former president Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, Republicans were poised to take the first concrete step toward repealing and replacing that law.

Legislative is never pretty, but what has been happening all week with the signature legislative priority of the GOP seems beyond the norms."
