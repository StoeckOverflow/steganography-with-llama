        "As the House of Representatives prepares to vote Thursday on a GOP Obamacare replacement plan, it remains to be seen if Republicans have enough votes to pass it. Assuming no Democrats support the measure, Republicans can lose two votes in the Senate and 22 votes in the House. As of Thursday afternoon \u2014 the day of the vote \u2014 here\u2019s how many Republicans have said that they\u2019ll vote against it: 37 House members 6 senators Other GOP lawmakers still have serious concerns about the legislation or said they are leaning against it.",
        "The modern congressional whip operation shifted into high gear Wednesday as the House Republican leadership scrambled to find support for its plan to overhaul the industry. But House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) does not have the tools that previous speakers once used to win over recalcitrants before cliffhanger votes. For some of these lawmakers, the health bill would be a lot easier to digest with a side of pork \u2014 some earmarked funding to show they deliver for their district. But earmarks were banished by Ryan\u2019s predecessor, John A.",
        "It\u2019s a common question among those decrying the cost of health insurance: Why should you have to purchase a plan that covers procedures you won\u2019t ever need? Especially if, say, you\u2019re a guy, and your plan covers maternity care \u2014 as Obamacare requires most plans sold through an exchange to do? It\u2019s also a philosophy in conservative circles gaining momentum as Republicans try to deconstruct Obamacare: Everyone should have to pay for their own unique health. But it\u2019s a philosophy that, when phrased the wrong way by the wrong person, can go terribly wrong. On Thursday, Sen.",
        "Stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one: House Republicans postponed a vote on a major piece of legislation set for Thursday night amid doubts that they could gather the 216 votes they needed to pass the bill. The White House \u2014 via spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders \u2014 expressed confidence in the face of the setback, insisting that the GOP attempt to overhaul the nation\u2019s system will pass Friday morning. But according to the Fix\u2019s House whip count, 35 House Republicans have already announced their opposition to the bill in its current form.",
        "House Intelligence Committee Democrats said Chairman Devin Nunes ( .) apologized to them Thursday during a meeting for his handling of revelations about surveillance that potentially could have been collected about President Trump and his associates during the transition period. Nunes\u2019s apology was \u201cgeneric,\u201d Rep. Jackie Speier ( .) a member of the Intelligence Committee, said on CNN, adding that it was \u201cnot clear\u201d precisely which actions his apology covered.",
        "Senate hearings on Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch ended Thursday on a confrontational note, with the body\u2019s top Democrat vowing a filibuster that could complicate Gorsuch\u2019s expected confirmation and ultimately upend the traditional approach to approving justices. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( . Y.) said he will vote no on President Trump\u2019s nominee and asked other Democrats to join him in blocking an vote on Gorsuch. Under Senate rules, it requires 60 votes to overcome such an obstacle.",
        "LONDON \u2014 British police on Thursday identified the lone attacker accused of carrying out a deadly knife and vehicle rampage as Khalid Masood, a British citizen who had a criminal record but was not suspected of plotting to \u201cmount a terrorist attack. \u201d In a statement, Scotland Yard said Masood was not the subject of any current investigations and had not been convicted of any terrorism offenses before, police say, he unleashed Wednesday\u2019s bloodshed.",
        "Forget the presidency, when it didn\u2019t matter \u2014 or so the Trump White House hoped \u2014 whether the president told the truth. In retrospect, those seem like the good old days. We have now entered even scarier territory, the presidency: If an assertion isn\u2019t true, no worry. President Trump will find a way to make it so, or at least claim it is. In The World According to Trump, the president makes a baseless assertion \u2014 perhaps to distract from bad news, perhaps to vent, perhaps simply to attract attention, the narcotic he craves in doses.",
        "Haider is prime minister of Iraq. Two weeks ago, I visited Iraqi troops in western Mosul as they prepared to liberate the last neighborhoods in the city. By any standard, they are heroes. I did not ask their religious, regional or ethnic origins. I saw them for what they were: Iraqis standing together against the cruelest killers on Earth. Some of the soldiers I met may have fallen since then in fighting.",
        "AMSTERDAM Many people do crazy things in middle age. I decided to write the libretto for an opera about Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli. It\u2019s called \u201cThe New Prince,\u201d premiering here this weekend at the Dutch National Opera. When I began work on this project in 2014 with composer Mohammed Fairouz, the possibility that Donald Trump would be president of the United States \u2014 or that the Machiavellian aspects of his personality would be a subject of global concern \u2014 was nearly unimaginable. But that was then.",
        "Under the big gray cloud, amid the general gloom, allow me to offer a ray of sunshine. The last two months have brought a pleasant surprise: Turns out the much feared, much predicted withering of our democratic institutions has been grossly exaggerated. The system lives. Let me explain. Donald Trump\u2019s triumph last year was based on a frontal attack on the Washington \u201cestablishment,\u201d that supremely cynical, bipartisan \u201ccartel\u201d (as Ted Cruz would have it) that allegedly runs everything. Yet the establishment proved to be Potemkin empty.",
        "Despite Republican control of the White House and both houses of Congress, the party\u2019s top priority \u2014 sharp, deep, tax cuts \u2014 is in trouble. And the chaos over the Obamacare repeal is largely to blame. Tax cuts (specifically, tax cuts for corporations and the rich) may be the only thing that Republican moderates and more radical Freedom Caucus members uniformly agree on. Axing taxes has somehow acquired status in the party of Lincoln, with politicians repeatedly trying to even Saint Ronald.",
        "DESPITE A frenzied campaign by the White House and Speaker Paul D. Ryan, House Republicans failed to vote on the American Health Care Act on Thursday. So much the better: A badly flawed bill that in its original conception would have done far more harm than good got steadily worse as the GOP leadership tried to buy conservative support. The AHCA underwent several major revisions this week that lawmakers had little time to process.",
        "Government officials overseeing the Trump International Hotel\u2019s lease with the federal government have determined the deal is in \u201cfull compliance\u201d despite a clause in the agreement barring any \u201celected official of the government of the United States\u201d from deriving \u201cany benefit. \u201d In a Thursday letter to Eric Trump, the president\u2019s son now overseeing the hotel, the project\u2019s contracting officer found the company met the terms of the lease because the president had resigned from a formal position with the company and the organization had restructured an internal operating agreement so he received no direct proceeds from the D.",
        "Senate lawmakers voted Thursday to repeal a historic set of rules aimed at protecting consumers\u2019 online data from their own Internet providers, in a move that could make it easier for broadband companies to sell and share their customers\u2019 usage information for advertising purposes. The rules, which prohibit providers from abusing the data they gather on their customers as they browse the Web on cellphones and computers, were approved last year over objections from Republicans who argued the regulations went too far. U. S. senators voted 50 to 48 to approve a joint resolution from Sen.",
        "President Trump had a remarkable interview with Time magazine on March 22 about falsehoods, in which he repeated many false claims that have repeatedly been debunked. Here\u2019s a of his key misstatements. \u201cSweden. I make the statement, everyone goes crazy. The next day they have a massive riot, and death, and problems. \u2026 A day later they had a horrible, horrible riot in Sweden, and you saw what happened. \u201d This is false. Trump at a rally on Feb. 11 made a reference to \u201cwhat\u2019s happening last night in Sweden,\u201d confusing people in that country since nothing had happened.",
        "The nation\u2019s top telecom regulator is moving further to thwart illegal that have annoyed countless consumers at dinnertime and scammed millions of Americans. The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday proposed new rules that would allow phone companies to target and block coming from what appear to be illegitimate or unassigned phone numbers. The rules could help cut down on the roughly 2. 4 billion automated calls that go out each month \u2014 many of them fraudulent, according to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai. \u201c are the No.",
        "A day after police say a white man admitted to fatally stabbing a black man in New York City and intending to kill many more, authorities charged him Thursday with murder as a hate crime, as prosecutors were also urged to pursue federal charges. Police say James H. Jackson, 28, of Baltimore told detectives that he traveled to New York from Maryland on a bus last week \u201cfor the purpose of killing black men,\u201d according to a complaint filed in New York Criminal Court.",
        "KIEV \u2014 In the plush, lobby bar of Kiev\u2019s Premier Palace Hotel, Denis Voronenkov, a Russian lawmaker who had defected to Ukraine, knew he was in danger. \u201cFor our personal safety, we can\u2019t let them know where we are,\u201d he said Monday evening as he sat with his wife for an interview with The Washington Post. Less than 72 hours later, he was dead, shot twice in the head in broad daylight outside the same lobby bar. It was a particularly brazen assassination that recalled the gangland violence of the 1990s.",
        "More than of mutations are the result of random mistakes in DNA replication that occur when normal cells divide, according to a paper published Thursday. The study is sure to renew a vigorous debate over how much people can do to prevent cancer and how much is unavoidable. The researchers, mathematician Cristian Tomasetti and cancer geneticist Bert Vogelstein, both of Johns Hopkins University, set out to determine what proportion of cancer mutations are due to unpredictable errors \u2014 as opposed to the two other main contributors to cancer, inherited genes and environmental factors, such as smoking and obesity.",
        "There were many days when Chandler Robbins rose before the sun to partake of the dawn chorus \u2014 the gentle coo of the mourning dove, the dulcet strain of the American robin, the fluting of the wood thrush, all heralding the arrival of morning. Among fellow birdwatchers, Mr. Robbins, who died March 20 at 98, was revered as a father of modern ornithology. He was the principal author of \u201cBirds of North America: A Guide to Field Identification,\u201d a bible for millions of enthusiasts who spend their happiest hours scanning the skies for winged creatures.

        "Last year, clashes in a conflict between Azerbaijani and ethnic Armenian forces in the Caucasus region motivated a number of young woman and girls to challenge traditional gender roles and pick up arms. \u201cThey are groundbreakers, facing resistance from many conservatives because they decided to go to a career where women are still not accepted,\u201d photographer Lena Mucha told In Sight.

        "Republican leaders abruptly pulled their overhaul of the nation\u2019s system from the House floor on Friday, a dramatic defeat for President Trump and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan that leaves a major campaign promise unfulfilled and casts doubt on the Republican Party\u2019s ability to govern. The decision leaves former president Barack Obama\u2019s chief domestic achievement in place and raises questions about the GOP\u2019s ability to advance other priorities, including tax reform and infrastructure spending.",
        "Shortly after House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) unveiled the Republican plan on March 6, President Trump sat in the Oval Office and queried his advisers: \u201cIs this really a good bill?\u201d And over the next 18 days, until the bill collapsed in the House on Friday afternoon in a humiliating defeat \u2014 the sharpest rebuke yet of Trump\u2019s young presidency and his negotiating skills \u2014 the question continued to nag at the president.",
        "President Trump has gotten a hard lesson from his first legislative debacle: Leadership takes more than being able to close a deal. \u201cI hope that Trump is going to learn from this that he has no choice except to be the chief legislator,\u201d said former House speaker Newt Gingrich. \u201cTrump has to start with the American people and come back to Congress. He can\u2019t start with arcane congressional procedures and go to the American people. That is exactly backward.",
        "Donald Trump was elected in large part on one, loud promise: I know how to make deals these normal politicians don\u2019t. Part of that mystique \u2014 as outlined in his book \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d \u2014 is the willingness to call his rival\u2019s bluff, to put his cards on the table and ask everyone else to do the same. That\u2019s what Trump did Thursday night after a postponement of the planned vote to begin the process of reforming the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans needed to put up or shut up, Trump insisted.",
        "Although House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) acknowledged Friday that \u201cObamacare is the law of the land,\u201d its survival or collapse in practical terms now rests with decisions that are in President Trump\u2019s hands. In the coming weeks and months, the White House and a highly conservative health and human services secretary will be faced with a series of choices over whether to shore up insurance marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 or let them atrophy.",
        "President Trump called me on my cellphone Friday afternoon at 3:31 p. m. At first I thought it was a reader with a complaint since it was a blocked number. Instead, it was the president calling from the Oval Office. His voice was even, his tone muted. He did not bury the lead. \u201cHello, Bob,\u201d Trump began. \u201cSo, we just pulled it.",
        "When President Trump called up The Post\u2019s Robert Costa to casually inform him that the massive legislative effort his party had been pushing on Capitol Hill had just collapsed, he waved away any suggestion that he\u2019d promised some other result. That bill, the American Health Care Act, was meant to serve as Republicans\u2019 Obamacare effort (though, thanks to the vagaries of the legislative vehicle the Republicans hoped to use, it was more of a device). That it was dead in the water within the first three months of Trump\u2019s presidency didn\u2019t seem to faze him at all."
