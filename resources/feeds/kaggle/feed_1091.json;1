        "How many Americans does it take to keep President Trump and his family in the lifestyle to which they are accustomed? Well, think of it this way. The Post this week had a scoop on the Secret Service requesting an additional $60 million in its next budget: $27 million to protect the president\u2019s wife and son in their penthouse at Trump Tower in New York, where they live instead of the White House, and $33 million for additional travel costs. The average family of four in the United States pays about $4, 000 a year in federal income taxes.",
        "As the Watergate probe was heating up in the summer of 1973, the special prosecutor\u2019s office gained a silent partner: the Treasury Department\u2019s Internal Revenue Service. The Watergate scandal had engulfed the activities of corporations and corporate officials. An IRS investigation found tax violations committed with campaign contributions to the 1972 presidential campaign of Richard M. Nixon. With information gained from the IRS, the special prosecutor\u2019s probe resulted in 18 corporate officials and 17 corporations pleading guilty to violations of campaign contribution laws. This week, FBI Director James B.",
        "In a week that felt like a month, Americans got a clear view of President Trump\u2019s governing style and also of his fabled dealmaking approach. Or rather, I should say, Trump got a good sense of what governing is like \u2014 hard, hard, hard. And it\u2019s bound to get more difficult given the president\u2019s tactics of consent: Do as I say or you\u2019re dead to me. Even bolder, Trump told congressional Republicans that if they didn\u2019t pass the American Health Care Act to repeal and replace Obamacare, he was finished. Done.",
        "PHOENIX As a boy, Barry Goldwater Jr. son of the former senator and 1964 Republican presidential nominee, would step out of his father\u2019s house and shoot at tin cans 50 yards away. Now 78, he says he could fire in any direction and not endanger \u201canything but a cactus. \u201d His father, born in 1909 in Arizona territory, three years before statehood, built the house on a bluff where, as an adolescent, he rode his horse and slept under the stars. There were about 30, 000 people in Phoenix.",
        "Lally Weymouth is a senior associate editor at The Washington Post. TALLINN, ESTONIA Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid trusts but verifies. Sitting in her office this past week, she told me she believes Vice President Pence\u2019s assurances that, despite President Trump\u2019s skepticism, the United States is committed to NATO. Nevertheless, a NATO battalion just arrived to make this small and vulnerable Baltic nation feel safer from Russia, a powerful neighbor historically ambivalent about its independence.",
        "THE NEXT time someone argues that a businessman would manage the country better than an experienced politician, remember this past week. The attempt by President Trump and House Republicans to force through a bill scorned by experts across the spectrum, projected to be a disaster for aging and people and opposed by a large majority of Americans ended in debacle. Now the danger is that a wounded president and his GOP allies will act on their sore feelings by irresponsibly attacking the existing system in other ways. The right course for Mr.",
        "MOSUL, Iraq \u2014 Iraqi rescue workers on Friday pulled dozens of bodies from the ruins of a building in Mosul where residents allege a U. S. coalition strike killed 137 people a week ago. If confirmed, the number would mark the biggest loss of civilian life in a single incident since the coalition\u2019s air campaign began 2\u00bd years ago. Equipped with a bulldozer and chain saws, men in red overalls picked their way through the rubble of the large house in the city\u2019s heavily bombarded neighborhood of Mosul . Brig. Gen.",
        "President Trump\u2019s administration claimed credit Friday for an announcement by cable provider Charter Communications that it intends to hire 20, 000 workers in the United States and invest $25 billion in Internet over the next four years. But parts of that pledge by Charter chief executive Tom Rutledge had already been made months ago. And some policy analysts say the investment isn\u2019t as large as it may seem. In a statement Friday on Twitter, President Trump said he was \u201cthrilled\u201d to announce Charter\u2019s decision after a meeting with Rutledge at the White House, portraying the highlights as news.",
        "HARRISBURG, Pa. \u2014 A jury found former Pennsylvania State University president Graham Spanier guilty of one misdemeanor count of child endangerment Friday, ending a case that dragged on for more than four years over whether Spanier and two other university executives covered up previous allegations made against former Penn State assistant football coach and convicted child molester Jerry Sandusky.",
        "LONDON \u2014 The man who brought terror to the heart of London on Wednesday was and authorities have given no indication his planning unfolded transnationally. But the attack at the Palace of Westminster had instant ramifications for Europe and for the globe, not least because of the international profile of those killed or injured, among them Brits, Americans, Romanians and Italians. There was another reason the attack sowed wider uncertainty, as it underscored questions about the terms of Britain\u2019s planned exit from the European Union.",
        "The House Intelligence Committee chairman said Friday that Paul Manafort, President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, has volunteered to be interviewed before his committee, which is investigating alleged ties between Trump campaign officials and Russia as well as the Kremlin\u2019s activities in the 2016 election. Chairman Devin Nunes ( .) said that Manafort\u2019s lawyer \u201ccontacted the committee yesterday to offer the committee the opportunity to interview his client. \u201d Nunes did not say whether the Manafort briefing would be public or take place behind closed doors, leaving the decision mostly up to Manafort himself.",
        "BOLINAS, Calif. \u2014 A few hundred feet from Bill Niman\u2019s modest ranch house is a barn he built to house pigs. It was the late 1970s. Niman already had been raising hogs for a few years outdoors when he got his hands on National Hog Farmer magazine. \u201cI thought, man, this stuff is cool,\u201d he said. \u201cYou put pigs in buildings. They don\u2019t have to be outside in the weather. It\u2019s easy to maintain. You push a few buttons and can run the whole . . . thing from your kitchen table.",
        "In the eyes of President Obama\u2019s Justice Department, private prisons were a necessary evil \u2014 less safe and effective than facilities run by the government, but needed because of the volume of inmates in the federal system. When Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates ordered them to be phased out in favor of facilities last year, she said she was able to do so only because the inmate population had declined, thanks to sentencing reform and other measures to keep people from serving long prison terms. Attorney General Jeff Sessions sees things differently.",
        "In rich countries, death rates are supposed to decline. But in the past decade and a half, white Americans have actually been dying faster. Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton first pointed out this disturbing trend in a 2015 study that highlighted three \u201cdiseases of despair\u201d: drugs, drinking and suicide. On Thursday, the pair released a deeper analysis that clears up one of the biggest misconceptions about their earlier research. The problem of dying whites can\u2019t only be blamed on rising rates of drug overdoses, suicides and chronic alcoholism, they say.",
        "It\u2019s a tough moment to be a woman shopping for business attire. As the \u201cathleisure\u201d trend keeps up its long tyranny, many retailers are ordering up loads of jogger pants and stylized sweatshirts instead of tailored trousers and silk blouses. Meanwhile, stalwarts such as Ann Taylor and Banana Republic seem to be operating with a broken fashion compass. Department stores are chasing hard after shinier objects, trying to win over millennials with trendy casual clothes. All of this has left a serious vacuum in the marketplace. And that white space is where women\u2019s apparel MM.",

        "MEMPHIS, Tenn. \u2014 Lonzo Ball, UCLA\u2019s wunderkind point guard and the potential first overall pick in the NBA Draft, has built his gleaming profile with an unattractive jump shot. He might be the best player on the court when the No. 3 Bruins face No. 2 Kentucky in a marvel of a South Region semifinal. It would be difficult to discern from only watching him shoot, aside from the end result.",
        "After Thursday night\u2019s Sweet 16 games, one thing has become clear: The national championship game is guaranteed to have at least one team that isn\u2019t among the NCAA\u2019s blue bloods. Go ahead, take a look at the left side of the bracket. One of the following teams will be playing on April 3: Gonzaga, Xavier, Wisconsin, Florida, South Carolina or Baylor.",
        "Robert Glick better known as Bud, believes, \u201cWhen we do documentary photography, we establish a permanent bond with those we photograph and the community in which we work. \u201d In the early 1980s, Glick was working as a photographer for the New York Chinatown History Project, which is now the Museum of Chinese in America. The goal of his work was to document the community as it transformed from an primarily older, male population to a generation of young families due to rapidly expanding immigration.",
        "The stunning collapse of the Republican bill now imperils the rest of President Trump\u2019s ambitious congressional agenda, with few prospects for quick victory on tax reform, construction projects or a host of other issues in the months ahead despite complete GOP control of government. While Republicans broadly share the goal of Trump\u2019s promised \u201cbig tax cuts,\u201d the president will have to bridge many of the same divides within his own party that sunk the attempted overhaul of the Affordable Care Act.",
        "President Trump and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan made it a binary choice: You\u2019re either for their legislation or you\u2019re for \u201cObamacare. \u201d From Reps. Trent Franks ( .) to Rodney Frelinghuysen ( . J.) spanning the party\u2019s ideological spectrum, the answer came back Friday: No, it\u2019s much more complex. It was filled with several different options and possible routes ahead, and dozens of Republicans agreed with their sentiment.",
        "days do not ultimately define a presidency, especially the first 65 of a new president\u2019s first term. That\u2019s as true for President Trump as for other presidents who suffered early setbacks. But without some serious stocktaking inside the White House after the failed effort to replace the Affordable Care Act, there could be more trouble ahead for the most unorthodox president of modern times.",
        "Vice President Pence said that President Trump intends to keep his promise to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, pledging that the legislation\u2019s collapse Friday was a setback that \u201cwon\u2019t last very long. \u201d \u201cPresident Trump is never going to stop fighting to keep his promises to the American people,\u201d Pence said during an appearance in Scott Depot, W. Va. where he blamed Democrats and \u201ca handful of Republicans\u201d for standing in the president\u2019s way.",
        "Let the blame game begin. Republicans\u2019 failure to overhaul the U. S. industry has ushered in a round of internal that threatens to deepen the very rifts that doomed the deal \u2014 and carve new ones that are likely to complicate the GOP\u2019s ability to function in the Trump era. Recriminations have been underway for weeks, but they intensified Saturday and cast a new spotlight on the breakdown that led Speaker Paul D.",
        "Why were Republicans rushing to vote on a plan that they\u2019d barely finished drafting, that budget scorekeepers hadn\u2019t had a chance to fully evaluate, and that, insofar as people did know about it, was widely despised? In part, it\u2019s because their plan was so unpopular and because it got more unpopular the more people learned about it.",
        "The U. S. military acknowledged for the first time Saturday that it launched an airstrike against the Islamic State in the densely packed Iraqi city of Mosul, where residents say more than 100 people were killed in a single event. If confirmed, the March 17 incident would mark the greatest loss of civilian life since the United States began strikes on Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria in 2014.",
        "At the Democratic convention in Philadelphia last summer, Jake Sullivan and I took to our golf carts one afternoon to make the rounds of the television networks\u2019 tents in the parking lot of the Wells Fargo Center. It is standard for presidential campaign staffers to brief networks on what to expect during that night\u2019s session.",
        "When Secretary of State Rex Tillerson showed up in Asia this month, he announced that the United States would take a \u201cnew approach \u201d to North Korea.

        "It\u2019s not even noon, and I\u2019ve already answered dozens of phone calls from angry constituents. A single mother demanded answers as to where her family could turn for services if Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act. An older gentleman had to take a breath as he used some choice words to describe House Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s proposals to cut Medicare benefits. The resentment and anger are palpable. Seconds after I hang up, the phone rings again. And again. And again. As a communications director for Rep."
