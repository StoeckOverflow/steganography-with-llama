        "IT IS a political cliche that President Trump owes his electoral victory to the extraordinary support he received from white voters without a college degree, of whom voted for the Republican. Much less settled is the question of why these largely voters, once reliable Democrats, cast their lot with a brash billionaire from New York. The precise source of the discontent that produced this outburst of reactionary populism is hotly debated; some of Mr. Trump\u2019s support reflects motives, such as xenophobia or racism, that can be neither comprehended nor respected.",
        "Most high school seniors have now heard back about their college applications, a process often cast as a kind of \u201cHunger Games,\u201d with young Americans battling it out for a chance to attend one of more than 3, 000 colleges, seeking help wherever it may come, believing that the result will determine the course of their lives.",
        "Friday may or may not have been the day that House Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s dream of repealing Obamacare died forever. But it was definitely the day that birthed anew a Internet fantasy in which Ryan ( .) is secretly an angsty closet rocker. The 2017 version of the old game, \u201cWhat does Paul Ryan listen to when he\u2019s sad?\u201d was \u2014 to be clear \u2014 totally unfair to Ryan, if not also to Papa Roach. It started with a tweet from writer Justin Halpern.",
        "Threats, vandalism and recent shootings across the country have sparked outrage and have been quickly decried as hate crimes: The fatal stabbing of a homeless black man in New York City on Monday by a white Maryland man who police said traveled to the city to act on his hatred of black men. The killing in Kansas of a man from India and the wounding of another. Bomb threats against Jewish schools nationwide and the desecration of Jewish cemeteries.

        "The U. S. government has not figured out how to deter the Russians from meddling in democratic processes, and stopping their interference in elections, both here and in Europe, is a pressing problem, the top civilian leader of the National Security Agency said.

        "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Laughter, music and the tapping of dancing shoes reverberated throughout a public memorial to Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher, which loved ones say is just how the actresses would have wanted it. There were few tears throughout the ceremony Saturday, which honored the duo\u2019s impact on film, culture and those who knew them with a mix of photos, videos, and anecdotes that kept the audience laughing and applauding.

        "The examinations, and dry runs using a 3D model of her tiny spine all came down to this: A team of surgeons made a careful incision and, over the next six hours, systematically removed an extra pelvis, legs, feet and tiny toes that were protruding from her neck and back. Since birth, baby Dominique had been carrying her parasitic twin. \u201cIt\u2019s as if the parasitic twin dove into Dominique\u2019s body and almost made it in except for the waist out,\u201d said John Ruge, director of pediatric neurosurgery at Advocate Children\u2019s Hospital near Chicago.",
        "Ivanka Trump\u2019s neighbors delivered a handwritten note welcoming her to their gilded Northwest Washington Zip code after she and her husband, Jared Kushner, moved from New York with their three small children. When the president\u2019s daughter did not respond, Rhona Friedman, an attorney who lives next door, understood. Ivanka was busy settling in, she figured. But Friedman and other neighbors were far less patient when two \u201cNo Parking\u201d signs appeared outside the Trump Kushner house and Secret Service SUVs began swallowing spots on Tracy Place NW, their block in the Kalorama neighborhood.",

        "NEW YORK \u2014 The Shot of the NCAA Tournament was everywhere Chris Chiozza looked, on big screens and small. Each time he shifted his tired eyes to his phone, there was another picture or angle on social media: his headlong dribble, the dodge toward open court, and then the floater, falling through the net at the buzzer. \u201cI enjoy it every time I watch it,\u201d he said. A game that had started late Friday night didn\u2019t end until early Saturday morning, when Chiozza\u2019s improbable shot gave Florida the Sweet 16 victory over Wisconsin in overtime, .",

        "There\u2019s a lot of entertaining in the Washington area \u2014 state dinners at the White House, political and charity fundraisers, blowout galas. But for many parents, especially those with small children, the thought of entertaining, even on a small scale, can be daunting. \u201cMany parents are discouraged to entertain while their kids are young because they are very aware of all the stressors and things that will likely go wrong,\u201d says Tori Tait, founder of Thoughtfully Simple, an entertainment and lifestyle blog.",
        "Dorie Greenspan\u2019s recent rallying cry for quiche got me thinking about other foodstuffs subject to surrender. So with this post, I challenge you to take back the sandwich, starting tomorrow. Sandwiches are hardly in jeopardy \u2014 as of last year, Americans ate an average of four per week. But more often than not, we are ceding the construction to someone else in the name of convenience, or settling into ruts where wan tomato slices meet deli meats. Here\u2019s your weekend plan: 1.

        "It hasn\u2019t been a great decade for fans of grain consumption \u2014 not even whole grains. Popular diet books like \u201cThe Paleo Diet,\u201d \u201cThe Wheat Belly Diet\u201d and many others have argued for limited grain consumption. Meanwhile, apparent scientific softening on the dictum has increased interest in healthy fat consumption. That, too, has put grains, which are mainly composed of carbohydrates, on trial. Nonetheless, a recent and highly controlled study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition lends support to consumption, especially in comparison to refined grains. The conclusions line up with the U. S.",
        "Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has asked the White House to lift restrictions on U. S. military support for Persian Gulf states engaged in a protracted civil war against Houthi rebels in Yemen, according to senior Trump administration officials.

McMaster, Mattis said that \u201climited support\u201d for Yemen operations being conducted by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 including a planned Emirati offensive to retake a key Red Sea port \u2014 would help combat a \u201ccommon threat. \u201d Approval of the request would mark a significant policy shift.",
        "The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee was on his way to an event in Washington late Tuesday when the evening\u2019s plans abruptly changed. After taking a brief phone call, Rep.

        "If President Trump is going to put the blame for Republicans\u2019 inability to pass legislation on the House Freedom Caucus, at least one member of the conservative coalition thinks it deserves it. Rep. Ted Poe ( .) resigned Sunday from the coalition of 35 to 40 conservative House lawmakers in protest over the group\u2019s opposition to the Republican bill that tanked in Congress on Friday. \u201cI have resigned from the House Freedom Caucus,\u201d Poe said in a statement.",

        "MOSCOW \u2014 A wave of unsanctioned rallies swept across Russia on Sunday to protest corruption in the government of President Vladi mir Putin in a nationwide show of defiance not seen in years, one the Kremlin had tried in vain to prevent with bans and warnings. Too angry to be cowed, they poured into the street, fed up with their country\u2019s corruption and a government unwilling, or unable, to stop it. Police responded with barricades, tear gas and mass arrests in cities across Russia.",
        "The first cocktail party at Barack Obama\u2019s new office last month was certainly more casual than any he had hosted in recent years. The wine bore a random assortment of labels, as if assembled . The appetizers were set out in the narrow hallway. The host, tieless, eschewed formal remarks, as a few dozen of his old administration officials \u2014 Joe Biden and former chief of staff Denis McDonough, as well as more junior ones \u2014 mingled in a minimalist suite that could be mistaken for a boutique law firm.",

        "From the perspective of impartiality, one of the problems with Congress investigating Russia\u2019s meddling in the U. S. election and whether President Trump\u2019s circle had anything to do with it is Congress itself. It\u2019s a political body made up of \u2014 well, politicians. That\u2019s not to say these politicians can\u2019t put on their impartial hats to undertake a investigation about the independence of U. S. democracy from foreign influence. But congressional investigations have a higher threshold of impartiality to meet than, say, an independent investigation outside the confines of Congress. In recent days, Rep."
