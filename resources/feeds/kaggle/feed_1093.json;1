        "President Trump and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan both want to rewrite the tax code, but their proposals differ on how much tax relief to give the middle class. Trump wants a tax cut across the board, according to the plan he published during the campaign. He has proposed relief for the wealthy especially, but also for less affluent households. The plan that Ryan ( .) and his colleagues in the House have put forward would not substantially reduce taxes for the middle class, and many households would pay more.",
        "The Trump administration is planning a much more assertive role in undertaking a broad overhaul of the tax code than it did during the failed effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, with some advisers working to craft a concrete blueprint for specific changes instead of letting Congress dictate details. But there are divisions with congressional Republicans and within the administration over who should be in charge of the effort \u2014 and how ambitious it should be, say administration officials and congressional aides.",
        "(Washington Post illustration; Kevin Images) The paparazzi no longer stake her out at her son\u2019s private school or search for her on the streets surrounding the black tower that her husband, the president of the United States, named for himself. Like legions of New Yorkers who hibernate in their apartments, Melania Trump is a virtual her refuge 58 stories above Manhattan\u2019s hoi polloi and laden with enough gold to embarrass a Saudi prince.",
        "House Speaker Paul D. Ryan told Republican donors Monday that he intends to continue pushing for an overhaul of the nation\u2019s system by working \u201con two tracks\u201d as he also pursues other elements of President Trump\u2019s agenda. \u201cWe are going to keep getting at this thing,\u201d Ryan said three days after intraparty opposition forced him to pull the American Health Care Act after it became clear it did not have enough Republican votes to pass.",
        "Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, may fall short of the votes needed for smooth passage in the Senate next week, potentially dashing Republican hopes for an easy victory after the stinging defeat of the American Health Care Act last week. Gorsuch needs 60 votes to clear a procedural hurdle required of confirmations in the Senate, but Republicans, who hold just 52 seats, may not have the votes in a chamber that is divided deeply along partisan lines.",
        "The central promise of the Trump administration \u2014 the repeal and replacement of Obamacare \u2014 has failed. The central premise of the Trump administration \u2014 that Donald Trump is a brilliant negotiator \u2014 has been discredited. In the process of losing a legislative battle, Trump has lost the theory of his presidency. It was a profoundly personal rejection. Trump\u2019s ignorance of policy details alienated legislators. His threats backfired. His bonhomie fell flat. The lessons, however, run deeper.",
        "On what seems a regular basis, the United Nations takes a poke at Israel \u2014 for its settlements policy, its treatment of Palestinians and, once, in the 1975 resolution equating Zionism with racism, merely for existing. Altogether, the United Nations and its agencies have condemned Israel so many times that, on one of those proportional maps, tiny Israel would loom over Saudi Arabia, with its beheadings and ban on women driving. This, in itself, calls for a resolution. Recently, a report prepared for a U. N. agency returned to the racism theme and called Israel an \u201capartheid regime.",
        "Attorney General Jeff Sessions showed up unannounced in the White House briefing room to attempt something President Trump very much needed after Friday\u2019s debacle: a change of subject. Sessions, accompanied by White House press secretary Sean Spicer, revived one of the reliable applause lines from the campaign, a crackdown on \u201csanctuary cities\u201d harboring illegal immigrants. \u201cDUIs, assaults, burglaries, drug crimes, gang rapes, crimes against children and murders,\u201d the attorney general recited. \u201cCountless Americans would be alive today and countless loved ones would not be grieving today if these policies of sanctuary cities were ended.",
        "You thought tax reform would be an easy win for Republicans? Oh, it feels good to laugh again. After the disaster, President Trump has decided to move on to tax reform. He\u2019s hoping to quickly restore public faith in his leadership, which has so far been stymied by federal judges, the House Freedom Caucus and basic math. But many of the issues that brought down will dog his tax plan, too. Some of these are procedural, and relate to arcane Senate rules governing the \ufb01libuster.",
        "Last week\u2019s fiasco could end up being a positive experience for President Trump if he learns a few obvious lessons. Spoiler alert: He won\u2019t. The first thing that should dawn on Trump is that the warring Republican factions in Congress have multiple agendas, none of which remotely resembles his own. This is why the bill that House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) was forced to withdraw on Friday \u2014 the abominable American Health Care Act \u2014 made such a cruel mockery of Trump\u2019s expansive campaign promises.",
        "UNTIL NOW there has been a stark contrast between the tactics of the U. S. military campaign to recapture Mosul, Iraq, from the Islamic State and those of Russian and Syrian government forces attacking rebels in neighboring Syria. The latter has featured deliberate bombing of civilian targets, including hospitals, food stores and aid convoys, at the cost of thousands of lives. In Mosul, meanwhile, Iraqi counterterrorism forces have sustained heavy casualties in street fighting while limiting the use of artillery and airstrikes to avoid civilian deaths, winning praise from humanitarian groups. A U. S.",
        "President Trump signed bills Monday overturning two education regulations, continuing the Republican majority\u2019s effort to undo key pieces of the previous administration\u2019s legacy. Trump\u2019s move scraps new requirements for programs that train new teachers and rolls back a set of rules outlining how states must carry out the Every Student Succeeds Act, a bipartisan federal law meant to hold schools accountable for student performance. In a signing ceremony at the White House Monday, the president hailed the measures for \u201cremoving an additional layer of bureaucracy to encourage freedom in our schools.",
        "Ever since 2012, scientists have been debating a complex and frankly explosive idea about how a warming planet will alter our weather \u2014 one that, if it\u2019s correct, would have profound implications across the Northern Hemisphere and especially in its middle latitudes, where hundreds of millions of people live. The idea is that climate change doesn\u2019t merely increase the overall likelihood of heat waves, say, or the volume of rainfall \u2014 it also changes the flow of weather itself.",
        "Nearly two dozen people from five states are accusing Attorney General Jeff Sessions of lying to the Senate Judiciary Committee about his communications with the Russian government and subsequently trying to cover up that lie, according to a complaint sent to the Department of Justice. The complaint, which names 23 residents, states that Sessions gave false and misleading testimony during his confirmation hearing in January when he told the Senate committee that he \u201cdid not have communications with the Russians.",
        "Since you can\u2019t spell \u201cschadenfreude\u201d without \u201cshade,\u201d on social media are gloating about the latest daily polling released from Gallup. Last week, they were celebrating Trump\u2019s reaching 37 percent, a low for his presidency that was already lower than the lowest Obama ever got. After Trump recovered somewhat, another plunge: Gallup now estimates he\u2019s at 36 percent. When that 37 percent figure came out, we urged caution, because we are boring scolds. But also because we pointed out that these daily figures (which are actually running averages) were volatile and because of whom Gallup polls.",
        "Roger W. Wilkins, a ranking Justice Department official during the 1960s who later composed Pulitzer editorials about the Watergate scandal for The Washington Post and wrote unsparingly about the conflicts and burdens he experienced as a black man in positions of influence, died March 26 at a nursing home in Kensington, Md. He was 85. The cause was complications from dementia, said his daughter Elizabeth Wilkins. In a career that traversed law, journalism and education, Mr.",
        "MANILA \u2014 Rodrigo Duterte does not need your money. But he will take it. Since his electoral triumph last summer, the man famous for cursing foreign leaders and calling for mass killing seems to be raking in the cash for Manila. A tidy $24 billion in deals with China. Fresh billions from Japan. Not to mention the tens of millions in military and development aid the United States sends each year \u2014 despite his call for a \u201cseparation.",
        "The alert from Fox News went out at 5:30 p. m. Sunday. \u201cPRESIDENT TRUMP SPENDING WEEKEND WORKING AT THE WHITE HOUSE,\u201d the chyron announced, under an image of the White House presumably captured just minutes before. The timing of the tweet alert was curious: After all, the weekend was nearly over. \u201c[T]his is like when you start to do your homework when you hear the garage door opening,\u201d one Twitter user noted. And, as it turned out, the announcement wasn\u2019t entirely true. News Alert: @POTUS spending weekend working at the White House. pic. twitter.",
        "When Howard University Hospital opened its doors as Freedmen\u2019s in Northwest D. C. in 1862, it stood out for the medical care it offered freed slaves and became an incubator for some of the country\u2019s brightest African American physicians. But over the past decade, the hospital that was the place for the city\u2019s black patients has been beset by financial troubles, empty beds and an exodus of respected physicians and administrators, many of whom said they are fed up with the way it is run.",
        "PHOENIX \u2014 Owners of the NFL\u2019s teams, convening Monday at a Phoenix resort for the annual league meeting, voted to ratify the Raiders\u2019 proposed relocation from Oakland to Las Vegas in a move that once would have been practically unthinkable given the league\u2019s public opposition to sports gambling. The Raiders will be the second major professional sports franchise to place a team in Las Vegas, the country\u2019s epicenter of sports betting. An NHL expansion franchise, the Vegas Golden Knights, will begin play in the league\u2019s season.",
        "A year after North Carolina enacted a law regulating transgender people\u2019s use of public restrooms, sparking boycotts and costing the state jobs and sports events alike, a new analysis says the legislation\u2019s economic fallout is greater than previously estimated. The \u201cbathroom bill\u201d could cost the state at least $3. 7 billion by 2028, according to an Associated Press assessment that tallied the losses \u2014 confirmed and projected \u2014 from events, meetings and business expansions that were scrapped due to the law.",
        "Congress sent proposed legislation to President Trump on Tuesday that wipes away landmark online privacy protections, the first salvo in what is likely to become a significant reworking of the rules governing Internet access in an era of Republican dominance. In a vote, House Republicans freed Internet service providers such as Verizon, AT&T and Comcast of protections approved just last year that had sought to limit what companies could do with information such as customer browsing habits, app usage history, location data and Social Security numbers.",
        "The Trump administration sought to block former acting attorney general Sally Yates from testifying in the House investigation of possible links between Russian officials and Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, according to letters provided to The Washington Post. The effort to keep Yates from testifying has further angered Democrats, who have accused Republicans of trying to damage the inquiry.",
        "President Trump wants Congress to add defense funding and money for a new wall along the Mexican border in a spending bill intended to keep the government open past April 28, but Capitol Hill Republicans signaled they will reject the idea to avoid a shutdown as well as the deep cuts that the new spending would require.",
        "MOSUL, Iraq \u2014 A sharp rise in the number of civilians reported killed in U. S. airstrikes in Iraq and Syria is spreading panic, deepening mistrust and triggering accusations that the United States and its partners may be acting without sufficient regard for lives of noncombatants. The escalation comes as local ground forces backed by air support from a U. S. coalition close in on the Islamic State\u2019s two main urban bastions \u2014 Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in Iraq.",
        "House Republicans struck an optimistic note Tuesday that they would be able to salvage their failed bill, but there was little indication of any concrete shift in the political fundamentals that led to its failure. Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) told reporters that \u201csome of those who were in the \u2018no\u2019 camp expressed a willingness to work on getting to yes and to making this work. \u201d He did not, however, commit to a particular path forward.",
        "Though Republicans profess to despise Big Government, especially the federal kind, it seems that what they really don\u2019t like is Democracy \u2014 and indeed prefer a monarchy. Yes, yes the czarina sighed, signaling her weariness with the palace historian\u2019s inevitable scold. I know America is a Republic and not a pure democracy, but let\u2019s not quibble over distinctions that make no difference. They\u2019ve elected a king whether they realize it or not! The czarina has a point. While it is true that the U. S.",
        "This, Mr. Speaker, is what you get for embracing Donald Trump. When Paul D. Ryan after a long Hamlet routine, decided to get behind Trump last year, he took a calculated risk that the erratic presidential candidate could become a vessel for the conservative policies the House speaker long aspired to implement. Instead, Ryan has become an enabler of Trump\u2019s chaotic and ethically challenged governance.",
        "John Podesta, the chair of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, served as counselor to President Barack Obama, where his duties included overseeing climate and energy policy, and chief of staff to Bill Clinton. President Trump is a man on a mission, or, perhaps better yet, a man on a rampage to reverse President Barack Obama\u2019s climate legacy and his substantial achievements in confronting the global threat of climate change. Unfortunately, that rampage is running into the reality that climate change is real and unforgiving.",
        "As the White House reboots for Trump 2. 0 after a largely unsuccessful first two months, one lesson should be obvious: The radical, polarizing politics of the campaign trail don\u2019t work well in governing the country. The United States isn\u2019t Russia or the Philippines. Our system has speed bumps, carefully constructed by our founders. Presidents don\u2019t rule simply by executive order. They must shape policies that are comprehensible to the public and can be enacted into law. In President Trump\u2019s first months in office, he too often behaved as an insurgent and disrupter, rather than a chief executive."
