President Trump s young administration is not yet at a crossroads, but   over the   Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act  \u201d also known as Obamacare  \u201d will only help the Democrats  presidential nominee in 2020.

        "Nine months after its dramatic referendum, Britain is finally demanding formal negotiations on exiting the European Union. Much has changed in the interim. At the time of the June vote, the cohesion of the West appeared to be in jeopardy; Britain seemed doomed to political instability; and the economy seemed at risk of a Lehman convulsion. Today, in contrast, Brexit feels about as electrifying as reading the telecoms annex in the WTO treaty. And yet, on the other hand, this change is deceptive. Anticlimax should not be mistaken for a permanent dodging of the populist bullet.",
        "White House press secretary Sean Spicer finally seemed to reach a breaking point Tuesday when it comes to questions about President Trump and Russia. Spicer got testy in an exchange with American Urban Radio Networks reporter April Ryan after Ryan announced a premise that Spicer disagreed with: that the White House has a Russia issue to deal with. By the end, Spicer accused Ryan of pushing her own agenda and even instructed her not to shake her head at him. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t have that,\u201d Spicer said when Ryan cited the White House\u2019s Russia issue.",
        "A heartfelt apology can be a beautiful step toward healing. Alex Jones\u2019s \u201cPizzagate\u201d apology doesn\u2019t come close. For one thing, the motivation seems to spring from his wallet, not the depths of his heart. Its timing strongly suggests that he wanted to minimize legal consequences for spreading, on his Infowars website, the bizarre and dangerous lie that a ring was being run out of a Washington pizza parlor, Comet Ping Pong. What\u2019s more, his words \u2014 even if you believe them \u2014 don\u2019t fix the damage.",
        "In the wake of the collapse of his first major legislative push on health care, President Trump and his aides have suddenly begun talking about reaching out to skeptical Democrats to breathe new life into his flagging administration. But there\u2019s little evidence that any actual outreach by the administration has occurred \u2014 and many Democrats warn it may already be too late. The abrupt talk of bipartisanship comes after two months in which Trump alienated Democrats with personal attacks and polarizing policies, both of which have made the road to cooperation more politically risky for the minority party.",
        "The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is defending an officer\u2019s of a boy at a Texas airport that outraged his mother and thousands and thousands of people who viewed her Facebook posting on the incident. For at least two minutes, the TSA officer at Worth International Airport gives the boy a that just seems a little too thorough. [Transgender passengers uneasy about TSA shift on .] First, the TSA officer explains to the boy what\u2019s coming. Then the TSA officer, who is wearing blue gloves, moves behind the kid and starts with a search of the kid\u2019s left shoulder.",
        "LONDON \u2014 The Scottish Parliament on Tuesday voted in favor of seeking another referendum on independence, setting the stage for a clash between the British prime minister and the first minister of Scotland. The motion in the semiautonomous Scottish Parliament had been widely expected to pass, with the minority Scottish National Party government and the Scottish Greens supporting it. Advocates for Scottish independence now have parliamentary authority for a referendum. But holding a binding referendum still requires approval from the British government.",
        "Presidents have regularly thrown out the ceremonial first pitch on Opening Day for Washington\u2019s major league team going back more than a century, but the tradition will not resume this year. The Nationals invited President Trump to do the honors on Monday afternoon, when the team opens its 2017 season at Nationals Park against the Miami Marlins, but the White House declined the invitation on Tuesday, citing a scheduling conflict, according to Nationals spokeswoman Jen Giglio.",

He was editor of The Post\u2019s Book World section in the 1970s and wrote two novels in the 1980s, one of which the Atlantic Monthly declared \u201ca flawless literary achievement.",
        "A man photographs the cherry blossoms across the Tidal Basin during the Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington in the 1940s. (Martha McMillan of Congress) It smelled like spring. It looked like spring. It felt like spring. Not only was this past Saturday considered peak bloom for Washington\u2019s cherry blossoms, it was a balmy spring day. But walking around the Tidal Basin on Saturday, pedestrians had to weave past more than just the fluffy pink flowers that overcame the freezing temperatures of a winter storm just days earlier. teens, families and professional photographers were everywhere.",
        "In June, a Belarusan American businessman who goes by the name Sergei Millian shared some tantalizing claims about Donald Trump. Trump had a relationship with Russian officials, Millian told an associate, and those officials were now feeding Trump damaging information about his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Millian said that the information provided to Trump had been \u201cvery helpful. \u201d Unbeknownst to Millian, however, his conversation was not confidential. His associate passed on what he had heard to a former British intelligence officer who had been hired by Trump\u2019s political opponents to gather information about the Republican\u2019s ties to Russia.",
        "The Senate Intelligence Committee will begin as soon as Monday privately interviewing 20 people in its ongoing investigation of Russian involvement in the 2016 election as well as potential ties to the Trump campaign, its leaders said Wednesday.

Warner ( .) anticipate scheduling, \u201cthey will eventually be part of a public hearing.",
        "BALTIMORE \u2014 The email from her sister said \u201cRead Now!\u201d so Veronica Spencer sat right down to open it. Maybe it was about the released Oprah movie about Spencer\u2019s Henrietta Lacks, the Baltimore cancer patient whose cells were collected by Johns Hopkins researchers without her knowledge. Or about Spencer\u2019s upcoming speech in Indiana, where she would talk to medical students about Henrietta\u2019s role in revolutionizing medicine. Instead, she learned that her and increasingly famous family was at war with itself. The March 2 email contained a link to a college newspaper story about her grandfather and uncle.",
        "Sens. Roger E. Wicker ( .) and Thomas R. Carper ( .) are not usually partisan firebrands, particularly on presidential appointments. Back in 2013, Wicker helped temporarily defuse a showdown over Republican filibusters of President Barack Obama\u2019s nominees to the judiciary and agencies. More than a decade ago, Carper voted to confirm President George W. Bush\u2019s first Supreme Court nominee and opposed Democratic efforts to filibuster the other.",
        "Congressional Republicans are working aggressively to craft an agreement intended to keep the government open past April 28, but their bid to avert a shutdown hinges on courting Democrats wary of President Trump and skirting the wrath of both hardline conservatives and Trump himself. The murky path forward on government funding sparked widespread unease Wednesday within the business community and at the Capitol, where Republicans speculated that Trump\u2019s request for money to build a wall along the border with Mexico and $30 billion in new defense spending may need to be delayed to avoid a shutdown.",
        "In his carefully calibrated testimony before House appropriators, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price made one thing clear Wednesday: The administration is still intent on dismantling parts of the Affordable Care Act even if Republicans lack the votes to rewrite it. Time and time again, Price invoked the pledge he has made repeatedly to lawmakers since President Trump selected him for his post. \u201cWhat we\u2019re committed to is making sure the American people have access to affordable coverage,\u201d he told Rep. Rosa L.",
        "The Senate\u2019s coming con\ufb01rmation of Neil Gorsuch will improve the Supreme Court, and Democrats\u2019 incontinent opposition to him will inadvertently improve the Senate \u2014 if Republicans are provoked to thoroughly reform the \ufb01libuster. If eight Democrats will not join the 52 Republicans in providing 60 votes to end debate and bring Gorsuch\u2019s nomination to a vote, Republicans should go beyond extending to Supreme Court nominees the prohibition of \ufb01libusters concerning other judicial nominees. Senate rules should be changed to rectify a mistake made 47 years ago.",
        "Since news broke that Jared Kushner will lead an effort to make government more efficient, I\u2019ve been asked the same three questions over and over. First, isn\u2019t this what Al Gore did with \u201cReinventing Government\u201d? Second, didn\u2019t that fail? And third, won\u2019t this fail, also? No, nope . . . and probably. Every recent president has launched an effort to employ learning from management experts, scholars and business leaders to improve the functioning of government. The one led by Gore is perhaps the most famous of these; the most recent was President Barack Obama\u2019s U. S.",
        "Democrats are weeping and gnashing their teeth about Attorney General Sessions\u2019s commitment to enforcing the nation\u2019s immigration laws. During Monday\u2019s White House press briefing, he put sanctuary cities on notice, arguing that if they continue to harbor criminals and ignore the law, there will be severe consequences. The Justice Department, he announced, is prepared to \u201cclaw back any funds awarded to a jurisdiction\u201d that violates federal statute. By holding $4.",
        "BLOOMINGTON, Ind. What ever happened to the interests of the working class? Weren\u2019t they supposed to be front and center in the Trump administration? Here\u2019s one clue: When a policy that helps some corporate sector can be repackaged to make it look like a move, President Trump will always hide his real purpose behind a phalanx of workers. Thus did he surround himself with coal miners on Tuesday when he signed a shamefully shortsighted executive order nullifying President Barack Obama\u2019s efforts. \u201cCome on, fellas,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou know what this is? You know what it says, right?",
        "According to the cynical old saw, apocryphally attributed to Joseph Stalin, a single death is a tragedy but a million deaths is a statistic. I\u2019ve been pondering that line lately, apropos the 183, 000 deaths related to prescription opioid overdoses between 1999 and 2015 \u2014 a figure sure to rise when 2016 data come out. A study published last week by economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton argues opioid overdoses help explain rising death rates for whites without a college education in the 21st century, when death rates for other demographic groups continue to fall.",
        "HOUSE SPEAKER Paul D. Ryan ( .) told GOP donors Monday that he had not abandoned his effort to pass a major reform bill. But he sounded a more realistic note last Friday: \u201cWe\u2019re going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future,\u201d he admitted after House Republicans failed to unite around a bill. The real question facing Republicans is one Mr. Ryan fielded Friday: \u201cDo we try to prop it up?\u201d His answer: \u201cIt is so fundamentally flawed, I don\u2019t know if that is possible. \u201d Actually, it is possible, and it is the responsibility of Mr.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 Samsung on Wednesday unveiled its latest premium smartphones, the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus, which the company hopes will restore its reputation as one of the world\u2019s best smartphone makers. To do that, of course, Samsung must recover from the disastrous recall of its last premium phone, the Galaxy Note 7. Samsung was forced to discontinue that product after a rash of battery fires, and also chose to delay the launch of these new phones in the wake of the controversy.",

Rexnord, an industrial supplier in Indianapolis, was starting the process of closing the factory and moving nearly 300 jobs to Monterrey, Mexico. Brian Reed, 45, knew this would happen. But he didn\u2019t expect it to twist his gut. He has worked a quarter century here, and his name topped the white piece of paper. Human resources had typed out his seniority number, too ( ).",
        "After Congress handed President Trump legislation Tuesday that would wipe away landmark privacy protections for Internet users, we received a lot of reader questions about what happens next. The legislation makes it easier for Internet providers, such as AT&T and Verizon, to collect and sell information such as your Web browsing history and app usage. But let\u2019s get into the details: You wanted to know whether the measure could help the government dig up dirt on people. You asked how to protect your privacy.",
        "President Trump lifted a moratorium on federal coal leases Tuesday, paving the way for excavation of a fossil fuel on public land in the West that few mining companies seem to want. With coal miners gathered around him, Trump signed an executive order rolling back a temporary ban on mining coal and a stream protection rule imposed by the Obama administration. The order follows the president\u2019s campaign promise to revive the struggling coal industry and bring back thousands of lost mining jobs in rural America.",
        "Nearly two weeks ago, Fox News legal analyst Andrew Napolitano was reportedly pulled from the air for making baseless claims that British intelligence officials spied on Donald Trump in 2016 at the request of Barack Obama.

Over six crisp and unsentimental pages, Britain said goodbye to the European Union on Wednesday, spelling out its hopes, wishes, threats and demands for divorce talks that will strain alliances, roil economies and consume attention across the continent over the next two years. Coming a little over nine months after British voters stunned the world by choosing to withdraw from the E.

Since 2007, the report found, the DEA has seized more than $4 billion in cash from people suspected of involvement with the drug trade.
