        "When Herlinde Koelbl started her photographic series \u201cTraces of Power\u201d in 1989, Germany was a year away from its War reunification, and Angela Merkel, now chancellor, was on the cusp of entering politics. A year later, once Merkel had been elected to the German Parliament and Helmut Kohl named her minister for women and youth, Koelbl caught up with the rising star. \u201cTraces of Power\u201d entailed taking two photos every year of a handful of major political figures in Germany: a facial portrait and a standing portrait. Koelbl has done this with Merkel since 1991.",
        "Former national security adviser Michael Flynn has offered to cooperate with congressional investigators in exchange for immunity from prosecution, a suggestion that has been met with initial skepticism, according to people familiar with the matter. \u201cGeneral Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit,\u2019\u2019 Flynn\u2019s attorney, Robert Kelner, said in a statement Thursday evening.",
        "At least three senior White House officials, including the top lawyer for the National Security Council, were involved in the handling of intelligence files that were shared with the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and showed that Trump campaign officials were swept up in U. S. surveillance of foreign nationals, according to U. S. officials. The White House role in the matter contradicts assertions by the committee\u2019s chairman, Rep.",
        "President Trump threatened Thursday to try to knock off members of the House Freedom Caucus in next year\u2019s elections if they don\u2019t fall in line \u2014 an extraordinary move that laid bare an escalating civil war within a Republican Party struggling to enact an ambitious agenda. In a series of tweets that began in the morning, the president warned that the powerful group of conservatives who helped block the party\u2019s bill last week would \u201churt the entire Republican agenda if they don\u2019t get on the team, & fast.",
        "Secretary of State Rex Tillerson takes a private elevator to his palatial office on the seventh floor of the State Department building, where sightings of him are rare on the floors below. On many days, he blocks out several hours on his schedule as \u201creading time,\u201d when he is cloistered in his office poring over the memos he prefers ahead of meetings. Most of his interactions are with an insular circle of political aides who are new to the State Department.",
        "The recent Republican debacle on health care could prove to be an opportunity. It highlighted, yet again, the complexity of the U. S. system, which continues to be by far the most expensive and inefficient in the advanced world. But President Trump could actually use the legislative collapse to fix health care if he went back to basics and to his core convictions on the topic, which are surprisingly intelligent and consistent. There is an understandable impulse on the right to assume that health care would work more efficiently if it were a free market, or a freer market.",
        "(for Obamacare) is not quite dead. It has been declared so, but what that means is that, for now, the president has (apparently) washed his hands of it and the House Republicans appear unable to reconcile their differences. Neither condition need be permanent. There are ideological differences among the various GOP factions, but what\u2019s overlooked is the role that procedure played in producing the deadlock. And procedure can easily be changed.",
        "Will anyone be left standing when the Republican circular firing squad runs out of ammunition? Or will everybody just reload and keep blasting away, leaving Democrats to clean up the bloody mess? The political moment we\u2019re living through is truly remarkable, but not in a good way. Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress, so we\u2019re basically in their hands. But they have nothing approaching consensus on what they should be doing \u2014 and they have failed to show basic competence at doing much of anything.",
        "Paul Ohm is a professor at Georgetown University Law Center and faculty director of the Georgetown Center on Privacy and Technology. Many are outraged about congressional efforts to eviscerate Internet privacy regulations set by the Federal Communications Commission under President Barack Obama. But a frightening aspect to the bill remains underappreciated: If signed, it could result in the greatest legislative expansion of the FBI\u2019s surveillance power since 2001\u2019s Patriot Act. Don\u2019t believe anyone who suggests that the law merely returns us to the state of the world before the FCC finalized its landmark privacy rules in October.",
        "Come Monday, the Trump administration may quietly revoke the ability of hundreds of thousands of immigrants \u2014 almost all women \u2014 from legally working in the United States, forcing them to choose between heading back to their kitchens or leaving the country altogether. They are the spouses of workers here on visas, and are typically themselves. Many have launched businesses that created jobs for U. S. citizens, whose employment may in turn be at risk, too. Take, for instance, entrepreneur Keerthi Ranjith, who lives in South Riding, Va.",
        "FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND more Virginians could get coverage, quickly and at minimal cost to the state. All that\u2019s needed is for in the General Assembly finally to put the of their people over partisanship, as Republicans in a variety of states now are doing. Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) not for the first (or 10th, or 50th) time, is making the argument for this totally reasonable expansion of coverage to people who desperately need it. Some analysts suggest he knows he still can\u2019t win in the legislature and is only teeing up the issue for the coming gubernatorial election.",
        "North Carolina lawmakers retreated from the state\u2019s controversial law that restricted which public restrooms transgender people can use, repealing it Thursday in the face of economic pressure in favor of a new bill that gay rights groups attacked as discriminatory. The legislature approved the bill Thursday and Gov. Roy Cooper (D) signed it, reversing a law that required transgender people to use public bathrooms matching the gender on their birth certificates. The new law drew intense opposition from civil rights advocates because it bans local governments from passing measures to protect LGBT people.",
        "The top Senate Democrat warned on Thursday that it is unlikely Democrats and Republicans can reach a deal by next week to avoid a bitter showdown over the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch, President Trump\u2019s first choice to serve on the U. S. Supreme Court. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be able to come to any kind of agreement,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( . Y.) said in an interview with The Washington Post. \u201cIt\u2019s virtually impossible.",
        "This post has been updated. Senate Republicans were forced to call on Vice President Pence to pass an antiabortion measure Thursday, marking the second time they\u2019ve cast a help line to the new administration to move legislation. Pence delivered the tiebreaking vote on a resolution reversing an Obama administration rule that prevented states from withholding dollars from Planned Parenthood and other clinics that provide abortions. The vice president\u2019s appearance in the Senate chamber was needed after two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, defected. No Democrats supported the resolution.",
        "NASA astronauts on a spacewalk Thursday accidentally lost a fabric shield needed for the International Space Station \u2014 a minor setback in what was otherwise a mission for one of the crew members. Astronauts Peggy Whitson and Shane Kimbrough were working on an area of the space station where a docking port had been disconnected and moved last week. They were in the process of using four large cloth panels to cover the access point where the docking port had been when one of the fabric shields suddenly drifted away and floated off into space.",
        "MOSCOW \u2014 The applause began in the upper balcony of the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory and spread through the auditorium until the entire audience was clapping in rhythm, like a crowd at a sports stadium, speaking a universal language: Play us an encore. The National Symphony Orchestra had just finished its first performance in Russia in nearly a quarter of a century. It arrived at a time when official relations between the United States and Russia are, to put it mildly, fraught.",
        "JERUSALEM \u2014 Israel\u2019s government on Thursday appeared set to approve the construction of a new Jewish settlement in the West Bank for the first time in 20 years, despite fierce opposition from Palestinians and a recent request from the White House to hold back on settlement activity. The move, which was unanimously approved by the security cabinet and is awaiting a final from the wider cabinet, is meant as compensation for the settlement of Amona, which was demolished more than a month ago after Israel\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that it was built on land privately owned by Palestinian farmers.",
        "Anquan Boldin spoke calmly, confidently, clearly late Thursday morning. He would have been in this chair, in front of this microphone, speaking about the relationship between police and the communities they serve even if he didn\u2019t have a story to tell. But he had a story. So he told it. He told it as part athlete and part activist. \u201cAthlete\u201d is what he is known as, a NFL veteran, a Super Bowl champion with the Baltimore Ravens, a wide receiver with more than 1, 000 career catches.",
        "Mars was once wetter and warmer, and very possibly a congenial environment for life as we know it. Today it looks mighty dead, with all due respect. If there\u2019s life, it\u2019s cryptic. Mars just ain\u2019t the planet it used to be. It\u2019s a desert world, with a pitifully thin atmosphere less than 1 percent the density of Earth\u2019s. That leaves the surface exposed to radiation and prone to huge temperature swings from day to night. If Mars was ever blue or green, it is surely red now. What happened?",

Evelyn Harris, a retiree who lives in Crofton, Md. was flying to San Diego this year when she went through an experience that a court might consider a sexual assault. She passed through the airport scanner at International Marshall Airport one day in January and was pulled aside for a that was just one step removed from being a Pap smear.",

The announcement comes after a year of pilot tests at locations in Dallas and Tulsa. The switch to fresh meat has been hyped as the chain s  most drastic menu change in decades.",
        "The Post\u2019s Ashley Parker wrote a big, profile of Karen Pence this week. And then she tweeted an anecdote to promote it: Mike Pence never dines alone w a woman not his wife, nor does he attends events w alcohol, her by his side. https: . \u2014 Ashley Parker (@AshleyRParker) March 29, 2017 The reaction was swift and extremely polarized. Many on the right quickly interpreted the tweet as the media somehow being shocked \u2014 shocked! \u2014 that a conservative Christian couple would establish such boundaries.",
        "President Trump entered his 11th week in office Friday in crisis mode, his governing agenda at risk of being subsumed by escalating questions about the White House\u2019s conduct in the Russia probe \u2014 which the president called a \u201cwitch hunt. \u201d Trump and his senior aides spent much of the day on the defensive, parrying the latest reports that senior administration officials had potentially acted improperly in the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation into Moscow\u2019s meddling in the U. S. elections and possible links between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russian officials.",
        "The president of the United States tweeted Friday morning that his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, should ask for immunity to testify to congressional investigators. But that apparently doesn\u2019t mean Trump thinks Flynn should be given that immunity. Somehow. Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss) by media & Dems, of historic proportion! \u2014 Donald J.",
        "Starting Friday evening, the White House will begin to release financial disclosure forms filed by about 180 members of the Trump administration who are either commissioned officers or paid more than $161, 755. Already, the administration is bragging that its members are way wealthier than those who worked for former president Barack Obama \u2014 a point of pride that doesn\u2019t quite match the president\u2019s campaign pledge to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of wealthy GOP donors, lifelong political operatives and those who are simply with everyday Americans.",
        "Stephen K. Bannon was running an investment banking company in Beverly Hills when his partner called with urgent news: a potential $10 billion deal was about to unfold in New York City involving a company they hoped to continue representing \u2014 and they didn\u2019t want to be left out of the action. Bannon, then in his told his business partner to meet him at the Los Angeles airport in an hour.

        "In defiance of Congress, the Navy has granted a retroactive promotion, back pay and a bigger pension to an admiral whom lawmakers forced to retire last year after multiple investigations found he had retaliated against whistleblowers, records show. Brian L. Losey, a former commander of the Navy SEALs, rose in rank to become a rear admiral in January after the Navy conducted a secretive and unusually rapid review of his case during the final days of the Obama administration, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post under the Freedom of Information Act.",
        "THE ANTIC behavior of Rep. Devin Nunes ( .) who was slipped classified surveillance by senior aides to President Trump, rushed to hold a news conference about it and then scurried back to the White House to brief Mr. Trump, was clumsy and clownish \u2014 but it may have accomplished its main purpose. Mr. Nunes managed to derail his own House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation into the far more serious matter of Russia\u2019s interference in the presidential election, and to distract attention from the emergence of troubling new evidence.",
        "We have come so far in just days, and soon we will have the answer to the question: What is the quintessential quote of the Trump administration? The quotes in our last have battled their way through many worthy competitors, from Potential Grizzlies to Frederick Douglass (contributing more and more! ).

In July 1972, I was on a train tour through Florida promoting the film \u201cThe Candidate. \u201d Entertainment and political press were on board, and I heard them gossiping about a at Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington.
