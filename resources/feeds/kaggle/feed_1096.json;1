        "Sportswriter: \u201cYou hit only two home runs all last year and already you\u2019ve hit seven this year [1969]. What\u2019s the difference?\u201d Reds outfielder Alex Johnson: \u201cFive. \u201d See? Baseball numbers aren\u2019t difficult. But be precise: As players say after a close play, \u201cClose only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades. \u201d And don\u2019t be discouraged if some questions stump you. As Phillies manager Danny Ozark said in 1976, \u201cEven Napoleon had his Watergate. \u201d And as Brewers manager Harvey Kuenn said after losing the 1982 World Series to the Cardinals, \u201cWe\u2019re going to hang our heads high.",
        "The name of the game is gaming the name. Politico this week reported on an innovative new policy from the Trump administration: An Energy Department official had directed staff \u201cnot to use the phrases \u2018climate change,\u2019 \u2018emissions reduction\u2019 or \u2018Paris Agreement\u2019 in written memos, briefings or other written communication. \u201d A department spokeswoman denied that there had been a new directive, which, given the administration\u2019s record of truthfulness, is practically a confirmation.",
        "Nina Jankowicz is a public policy fellow in Ukraine, where she provides advice on strategic communications and conducts research on activities across Europe. The views presented here are her own. In the fight against fake news, governments around the world are engaging \u201cstrategic communications\u201d specialists to cut through the noise and come up with a magic formula to make an otherwise unremarkable communique achieve the same virality as a video of two cats playing .",
        "Another potential Democratic swing vote announced Friday that she will vote against Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump\u2019s nominee for the U. S. Supreme Court. Sen. Claire McCaskill ( .) admitted it was \u201ca really difficult decision for me\u201d but that she will vote against Gorsuch when his nomination comes up for a vote in the Senate next week \u2014 and will support a Democratic filibuster of him. In an explanation posted on the essay site Medium, McCaskill acknowledged that she and 10 other Democrats have been facing intense political pressure to back Trump\u2019s choice for the high court.",
        "Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly fired back at California\u2019s chief justice for criticizing the use of courthouses to arrest undocumented immigrants, writing in a letter released Friday that the practice was only necessary because the state was so uncooperative on immigration enforcement matters. Responding to a missive from California Chief Justice Tani G. Sessions and Kelly wrote that the characterization of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers \u201cstalking\u201d undocumented immigrants at courthouses was \u201cparticularly troubling,\u201d and that officers were within their rights to arrest undocumented immigrants in public places.",
        "Greg Akili had just finished paying for his $9 tuna melt at a diner in South Central Los Angeles when his waiter lingered to chat. Akili\u2019s debit card \u2014 featuring a painting of a black youth wearing a hoodie and the famous image of the 1968 Olympic medalists, heads bowed, fists raised \u2014 had caught the young man\u2019s eye. For the third time that day, Akili lit up and launched into a conversation he\u2019s been having daily, with strangers and friends alike.",
        "This post has been updated. Germany\u2019s foreign minister on Friday morning said the Trump administration is taking a \u201cdangerous step\u201d after the Commerce Department announced a tariff on imports of foreign steel, indicating the tax could become a new source of conflict with the powerful U. S. ally and trading partner. The strongly worded statement from German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel further intensified trade tensions between the United States and international officials since President Trump took office.",
        "LOS ANGELES \u2014 In the packed auditorium at the Creative Artists Agency, a vortex of entertainment industry power and current progressive political woe, comedian Kathy Griffin \u2014 tiny, insistently \u2014 erupts in rasp at the man in the boxy gray suit as he finishes up onstage. \u201cI saw you on the Joy Reid show on MSNBC,\u201d Griffin says, coming up from the audience to address Rep. Ted Lieu, a California Democrat speaking at the CAA Foundation\u2019s Take Action Day.",
        "An experimental Zika vaccine has moved successfully into broader testing, with the first volunteer receiving a test dose in Houston earlier this week. Testing will also begin in Miami and San Juan, Puerto Rico, and by June, researchers hope to enroll more than 2, 000 volunteers in those cities and other regions in the Americas to determine whether the vaccine is effective in preventing infection, a top U. S. researcher said Friday.",
        "One lawmaker is citing a godly reference to\u00c2 justify changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: Rep. Jodey Arrington ( .) recently quoted the New Testament to question the strength of current work requirements. The biblical passage, 2 Thessalonians was a rebuttal to one of the hearing s expert witnesses, a representative of the Jewish group MAZON. (He referenced Leviticus.) It is also a familiar refrain to anyone who has watched past debates about SNAP. House Republicans have historically cited the verse \u201d if a man will not work, he shall not eat ?",
        "DALLAS \u2014 Women in college athletics are pretty tired of living in Guyville 1976. Seriously. But the question is what anyone is supposed to do about that when the leading voice in women\u2019s basketball, Geno Auriemma, makes his own daughter bang her head against a desk in frustration. Asked at the Final Four why the number of female coaches is dropping precipitously, Auriemma pronounced: \u201cIt\u2019s quite simple. Not as many women want to coach. \u201d He sees no sexism or roadblocks for women in the NCAA, it\u2019s just that most women probably prefer \u201ca normal life,\u201d he continued.",
        "All that madness has led us here: the final weekend of the NCAA tournament. Saturday\u2019s Final Four will whittle the field to two, and Monday night, we will have a national champion. Will it be tournament darling South Carolina? Gritty Gonzaga? The persistent Oregon Ducks? Or reliable North Carolina? Below, we\u2019ve put together all the information you need for this weekend, and stay tuned \u2014 this story will update with all the latest and greatest from the Final Four.

        "GLENDALE, Ariz. \u2014 At midnight Thursday, surrounded by old friends and maybe fueled by a couple drinks, Dan Monson the point guard from the best team he ever coached. He knew Quentin Hall would be asleep; it was 3 a. m. in the Bahamas. Monson and a few others, gathered at a party in Phoenix to celebrate what Gonzaga has become, shouted a message into Hall\u2019s voice mail. \u201cYou should be here! Why aren\u2019t you here?\u201d When he awoke this morning, Hall called Monson and told him he had heard his phone buzz, but ignored it.",
        "When people talk about the poor, especially people who haven\u2019t experienced poverty, it\u2019s often without context or compassion. President Trump\u2019s budget, which thankfully faces steep resistance from Congress, says a lot about what he thinks of struggling Americans. The poor don\u2019t work hard enough. The poor don\u2019t need federally funded employment programs. They just need to get a job. The poor should learn to feed themselves. Food programs only enable them to rely on government handouts. Out of context, the statements seem reasonable to many people. I know, because I\u2019ve heard from them.",
        "In the the United States was transforming from a rural, agrarian culture mostly clustered on the East Coast to an industrialized one. Along with this, Americans increasingly looked west to their future, traversing the Appalachia into the Midwest and beyond, dramatically altering the landscape in their wake. With them came the new medium of photography, not just to record these changes but also to preserve images of the natural beauty that was being plundered.",
        "The men who built the secret bomb factory had been clever \u2014 suspiciously so, Bahraini investigators thought, for a gang known mostly for lobbing molotov cocktails at police. The underground complex had been hewed, foot by foot, beneath the floor of a suburban villa, with no visible traces at street level and only a single entrance, hidden behind a kitchen cabinet. But the real surprises lay inside. In one room, police found $20, 000 lathes and hydraulic presses for making projectiles capable of slicing through a tank.",
        "Democrats in Congress have a new and surprising tool at their disposal in the era of Republican rule in President Trump\u2019s Washington: power. It turns out that Republicans need the minority party to help them avoid a government shutdown at the end of April, when the current spending deal to fund the government expires. And Democrats have decided, for now at least, that they will use their leverage to reassert themselves and ensure the continued funding of their top priorities \u2014 by negotiating with Republicans. \u201cI think we have a lot of leverage here,\u201d said Sen.",
        "On Saturday, an aide to President Trump took to Twitter to denounce a renegade House Republican and encouraged other Republicans to defeat the wayward lawmaker in a GOP primary next year. On Monday, liberal advocacy groups plan to deliver a petition to the political arm of Senate Democrats denouncing a pair of Democratic incumbents who intend to break ranks to support Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch. The groups plan to demand that Democrats refrain from spending any funds to reelect Sens. Joe Manchin III (W. Va.) and Heidi Heitkamp (N.",
        "When the government last shut down, in 2013, Mick Mulvaney considered himself part of \u201cthe Shutdown Caucus\u201d \u2014 a group of conservative House Republicans who held such a hard line that they were willing to let the lights go out. Now, four years later, Mulvaney is on a collision course with his former comrades, responsible for convincing intransigent House Republicans to make a different kind of choice and pass a new spending bill by April 28 to avert another shutdown.",
        "The University of Virginia\u2019s fundraising team for years has sought to help children of wealthy alumni and prominent donors who apply for admission, flagging their cases internally for special handling, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post. The records from the . advancement office, which oversees fundraising for the prestigious public flagship, reveal nearly a decade of efforts to monitor admission bids and in some cases assist those in jeopardy of rejection. . denies that the advancement office held any sway over admissions decisions.",
        "Before resigning under pressure as President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Michael Flynn submitted a personal financial disclosure form to federal ethics officials that failed to note speaking fees he received from entities in 2015, new filings show. Flynn later noted the payments on an amended form he signed Friday that listed among his sources of income the Russian television network RT, a U. S. air cargo company affiliated with the Group and the U. S. subsidiary of Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab.",
        "The word came down from White House officials late Friday afternoon: In a few hours, they would begin releasing the personal financial disclosures of about 180 top aides, as required by federal ethics rules. The Washington Post scrambled a team of reporters to pore over the documents as they came in. It did not take long for one major story line to emerge from the filings: President Trump has drawn from the country\u2019s financial elite to staff his administration. We found that 27 top aides together held assets worth at least $2.",
        "On my first day of work as the editor in chief of the New York Observer, which had been acquired five years earlier by Jared Kushner, now the and senior adviser to President Trump, I inherited an office and a desktop computer, both in fine but used condition. The computer was a Mac, but when I turned it on, it was inexplicably running Windows. I summoned our beleaguered IT guy to explain, and he informed me that it had belonged to Kushner, who liked the design of Apple products but preferred the Windows OS.",
        "On April 22, dozens of letters protesting President Trump written by women around the country will arrive at the White House in a giant envelope (of sorts) in the shape of a vulva, courtesy of platform Mogul. The campaign, called #ReadMyLips, is a reference not to George H. W. Bush\u2019s fateful 1988 campaign promise, but to female anatomy. And so the vagina protest motif has moved from the abstract and (that is, the pussy hat) to the branded and literal. Vaginally oriented resistance wasn\u2019t born in response to Trumpism.",
        "On May 14, 1917, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus descended upon the nation\u2019s capital on four trains stretching more than a mile. The Washington Post reported that a crowd of about 30, 000 people gathered at the show grounds at 15th and H streets to watch the construction of the tented city, which housed 1, 370 performers and laborers, more than 1, 000 wild animals, 735 horses and 41 elephants for the stand. The big top could hold more than 10, 000 people for a single performance. Nearly 100 years later, the Ringling Bros.",
        "It may not be apparent when President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping meet beneath the towering palms and crystal chandeliers at this coming week, but the nations they lead are on a collision course for war. An irresistibly rising China is challenging the United States\u2019 accustomed dominance. Consider that the U. S. share of global economic output fell from 22 percent in 1980 to 16 percent today, while China\u2019s grew from 2 percent to 18 percent over the same period.",
        "Someday, when Paul Ryan and John Boehner reflect on the difficulties of herding a fractious House Republican caucus, they\u2019ll both be haunted by the onetime owner of a western North Carolina sandwich Hill power broker: Rep. Mark Meadows ( . C.). Back in summer 2015, Meadows targeted Boehner by filing a \u201cmotion to vacate\u201d \u2014 essentially a vote of no confidence in his leadership. Boehner recognized how difficult it would be to continue even if he won that vote and stepped down instead, leaving Ryan in his place.",
        "MR. PUTIN: Operative in the Kremlin By Fiona Hill and Clifford G. Gaddy Brookings Institution Press. 533 pp. $32 Remember the unverified \u201cdossier\u201d assembled by a shadowy foreign intelligence veteran who alleged all manner of nefarious, kinky and compromising ties between Donald Trump and Russia? Well, now the Trump team has its own dossier on Russian President Vladimir Putin. It\u2019s better sourced, convincingly written, damning in its conclusions \u2014 and its author is scheduled to start working at the White House on Monday.",
        "The first 911 call came just past noon on Wednesday, nearly 20 minutes before a fatal crash killed more than a dozen seniors. A white pickup truck was driving erratically on a highway, a caller told a county dispatcher in South Texas. Five minutes later, at 12:07 p. m. the same caller called authorities in a neighboring county. \u201cI\u2019m following this guy. He\u2019s in a white Dodge dually. He\u2019s all over the road, both sides,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to hit somebody head on, or he\u2019s going to kill his own damn self. \u201d By 12:20 p. m.",
        "Tina Fey recently took aim at white women who supported Donald Trump. \u201cA lot of this election was turned by white, women who now would like to forget about this election and go back to watching HGTV,\u201d the actress and comedian said during a Facebook Live fundraiser for the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cYou can\u2019t look away because it doesn\u2019t affect you this minute, but it\u2019s going to affect you eventually. \u201d Fey made the comments during a conversation that centered largely on women\u2019s reproductive rights."
