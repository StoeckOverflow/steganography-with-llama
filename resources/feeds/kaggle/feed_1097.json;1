        "BOGOTA, Colombia \u2014 An avalanche of water from three overflowing rivers swept through a small city in Colombia while people slept, destroying homes, sweeping away cars and killing at least 193 unsuspecting residents. The incident triggered by intense rains happened around midnight in Mocoa, a provincial capital of about 40, 000 tucked between mountains near Colombia\u2019s southern border with Ecuador. Muddy water and debris quickly surged through the city\u2019s streets, toppling homes, ripping trees from their roots and carrying them downstream.",
        "Fox News star Bill O\u2019Reilly and the network have paid out some $13 million to five women over the past 15 years to settle a series of harassment allegations against the opinionated host, according to a published report in the New York Times. The settlements, three of which had been previously undisclosed, were in exchange for the women\u2019s agreement not to sue the company, which has been beset by allegations of sexual harassment by its and former chairman, Roger Ailes, the Times found. Ailes was ousted by 21st Century Fox, the parent company of Fox News, last summer.",
        "\u201c \u201d has died down, but in its place, a pressing question has arisen: How easy is it to get kicked off a flight? The answer: It depends. Every airline has a \u201ccontract of carriage,\u201d which outlines, in fairly broad terms, the actions that could cause a passenger to be denied boarding or removed from a flight. Delta has a contract, Southwest Airlines has a contract and United has 30 rules in its contract. When passengers purchase tickets, they agree to all of these terms.",
        "TAWILA, Syria \u2014 Late last year, two American Marxists traveled to northeastern Syria with the goal of experiencing firsthand the egalitarian utopia Syria\u2019s Kurds are seeking to build. Instead, they found themselves fighting on the front lines of a war, against the Islamic State and alongside the agents of imperialism that their political convictions have taught them to despise. For Brace Belden, 27, a florist from San Francisco, and Lucas Chapman, 21, an American University history graduate, a journey intended to deepen their understanding of how socialism works turned into much more of an adventure than they had anticipated.",
        "Three people have been charged in connection to a Thursday fire north of downtown Atlanta that resulted in the collapse of an elevated span of Interstate 85, a major city thoroughfare that connects five states. Basil Eleby is charged with arson and criminal damage to property, a felony. His bail was set at $200, 000. Sophia Bruner and Barry Thomas were charged with criminal trespass, and investigators said more charges could be pending. The three had gathered under the bridge to smoke crack, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by the Atlanta .",
        "When Wiley Day fell asleep on March 22, his iPhone was not far away. Like so many others, he had grown used to keeping his phone with him in bed, via an extension cord, as it charged overnight. The Huntsville, Ala. man would soon regret that habit. The next morning, Day woke up and rolled over. As he did so, a necklace that he was wearing happened to catch on the exposed prongs of the charger head, which had come loose from the extension cord.",
        "All that madness has led us here: the final weekend of the NCAA tournament. Saturday\u2019s Final Four will whittle the field to two, and Monday night, we will have a national champion. Will it be tournament darling South Carolina? Gritty Gonzaga? The persistent Oregon Ducks? Or reliable North Carolina? Below, we\u2019ve put together all the information you need for this weekend, and stay tuned \u2014 this story will update with all the latest and greatest from the Final Four.",
        "The 18, 733 residents of Fairmont, W. Va. probably don\u2019t even give the gleaming, modern office building on the edge of their town a second glance. But crooks on the other side of the world know all about it. It\u2019s called the IC3, which stands for Internet Crime Complaint Center, and the FBI analysts who work there track cybercriminals \u2014 no matter where they are. \u201cWe see a lot of connections internationally,\u201d said Donna Gregory, unit chief of the IC3. \u201cThe fraud has really advanced. The subjects are very savvy.",
        "On this Jewish holiday, which begins sundown April 10 this year, those who observe its dietary restrictions do not eat any foods made from wheat except for matzoh, and that prohibition includes oat, rye, barley and spelt. For generations, Passover desserts got a bad rap because bakers had only matzoh flour and potato starch at their disposal, which imparted what came to be known as the \u201cPassover taste. \u201d Not a good thing. [Make the recipe: Passover Linzer Tart] Well, an entire industry is now devoted to Passover desserts.",
        "Sarah Matheson\u2019s motivation for dating was simple: She needed a . Specifically, to her younger brother\u2019s wedding five months out, in October 2011. Sarah hoped that by securing a date, she could avoid a barrage of probing \u2014 albeit \u2014 questions from her family about her love life. \u201cI obviously wanted to be in a relationship, but because I never felt there was a timeline, I never fully applied myself to dating,\u201d she admits. Her brother\u2019s nuptials were the push \u2014 and the deadline \u2014 she needed.",
        "For a second consecutive weekend, President Trump remained in Washington \u2014 tweeting in the morning, holding meetings at the White House and heading to his Virginia golf club on Sunday \u2014 all the time surrounded by aides and patrons yet, increasingly, politically marooned. Weighed down by dismal approval ratings, the president has been unable to wrangle enough support in Congress to advance his agenda and is searching for outside support to defend him from attacks coming from all sides.",
        "The battle to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U. S. Supreme Court is set to come to a head this week and will probably reshape how the Senate confirms future justices, prompting senators and other observers to warn that subsequent battles over court nominees could be even more heated. Gorsuch\u2019s nomination to replace Antonin Scalia, with whom he shares an \u201coriginalist\u201d philosophy of constitutional interpretation, is unlikely to tip the ideological balance of the Supreme Court. And Gorsuch\u2019s three days of confirmation hearings last month never captured the national attention afforded to previous nominees.",
        "DURANT, Okla. \u2014 At the Boys and Girls Club in this rural city in southern Oklahoma, the director is unsure how he will stay open if President Trump\u2019s proposed budget goes through, eliminating money for several staff positions. Similar conversations are happening at the Oklahoma Shakespearean Festival\u2019s arts program, which relies on National Endowment for the Arts grants that Trump wants to eliminate. And at the county senior center, which already lost its state funding and could lose all or most of its federal funding, too.",
        "BEIRUT \u2014 One evening in the early days of Syria\u2019s uprising, Mohsen \u2019s band of activists slipped through the Damascus streets and waited for the coast to clear. Then they crouched, opened their bags and let out a stream of color. Thousands of balls, painted green, pink, blue and yellow, bounced past policemen, who scrambled to stop them. Residents would find balls tucked in nooks and crannies for months. Each was marked with a single word: \u201cFreedom.",
        "Now that House Republicans have squandered their shot at reordering Medicaid, governors who want conservative changes in the health program for Americans must get special permission from the Trump administration. Near the front of the line is Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican who not only supports work requirements and premium payments but also a new additional condition: to make applicants undergo a drug test if they\u2019re suspected of substance abuse. If Walker gets his way, Wisconsin would be the first state in the country with mandatory drug screening for Medicaid enrollees.",
        "QUITO, Ecuador \u2014 A narrow finish in Ecuador\u2019s presidential election had both candidates declaring victory Sunday, with the country on edge and possibly heading for a political crisis. With nearly 93 percent of the ballots counted, leftist candidate Len\u00edn Moreno was leading 51 percent to 49 percent over challenger Guillermo Lasso. But both men claimed victory ahead of the final results, with Lasso citing a key exit poll showing him winning by a comfortable margin. Speaking on television after an emotional speech declaring victory, he said that the official results were fraudulent and that \u201cthe Ecuadoran people aren\u2019t fools.",
        "It began with tweets from D. C. police in late December: \u201cCRITICAL MISSING\u201d trumpeted one alert about a girl with a ponytail and pink slippers who was last seen outside her home in Southeast Washington. The siren echoed through cyberspace, retweeted 113 times, reposted by as many more on Instagram and Facebook. When the girl returned home hours later, that news was retweeted just 13 times. A similar scenario soon began playing out daily, part of a new police initiative to tap the power of social media to locate missing children \u2014 a version of the milk carton.",
        "President Trump\u2019s attacks on conservative members of his own party come as his allies beef up an array of groups to promote his agenda, amassing firepower that could end up trained on fellow Republicans. At least four separate organizations are now seeking to drive public support for Trump and his priorities \u2014 a marked shift from the first two months of his administration, when the White House had limited outside air cover. The immediate goal: to lean on Democratic senators in the to a vote expected this week on Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch.",
        "A tweet by White House social media director Dan Scavino Jr. urging supporters of President Trump to challenge a GOP lawmaker may have violated a federal law that prohibits officials from using their positions for political activity, ethics experts said. On Saturday, Scavino went after Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, calling him \u201ca big liability\u201d in a tweet from his personal account. \u201d#TrumpTrain, defeat him in primary,\u201d he added. . @realDonaldTrump is bringing auto plants & jobs back to Michigan. @justinamash is a big liability. #TrumpTrain, defeat him in primary. \u2014 Dan Scavino Jr.",
        "The courts keep taking Donald Trump both seriously and literally. And the president\u2019s word choices are proving to be a real headache. A federal judge in Kentucky is the latest to take Trump at his word when he says something controversial. Judge David J. Hale ruled against efforts by Trump\u2019s attorneys to throw out a lawsuit accusing him of inciting violence against protesters at a March 2016 campaign rally in Louisville. At the rally, Trump repeatedly said \u201cget \u2019em out of here\u201d before, according to the protesters, they were shoved and punched by his supporters.",
        "Roger Daltrey of the Who sang it with a scream in 1971: \u201cWe don\u2019t get fooled again!\u201d And yet, we still do. Oh, do we ever. Remember this one from the presidential campaign? The \u201cnews story\u201d that spread the lie that Pope Francis had endorsed Donald Trump for president? It was shared more than a million times. Or recall the faked report that the leader of the Islamic State was urging American Muslims to vote for Hillary Clinton. With the proliferation of hoaxes, conspiracy theories, doctored photos and lies that look like news, it\u2019s inevitable: We\u2019re all chumps sometimes.",
        "GLENDALE, Calif. \u2014 When Philip Baker Hall was young, he looked old. He sounded ancient, Methuselah with a swell thatch of hair. He appears to have been born with bags under his doleful eyes. The bags have since sublet bags. The voice, scuffed with age, has been compared to sandpaper, a burlap bag, miles of hard road, shoe leather and never to a summer\u2019s eve. \u201cHe has a look, a gravitas and weight,\u201d says actor John C.

        "DALLAS \u2014 South Carolina\u2019s mastery of Mississippi State in women\u2019s basketball continued on Sunday night, with this latest installment delivering the Gamecocks their first national championship following a victory at American Airlines Center.

        "The United Arab Emirates arranged a secret meeting in January between Blackwater founder Erik Prince and a Russian close to President Vladi mir Putin as part of an apparent effort to establish a line of communication between Moscow and Donald Trump, according to U.

        "The Washington Post\u2019s national security team just registered another big scoop: Shortly before President Trump\u2019s inauguration, Blackwater founder Erik Prince conducted a secret meeting with a Russian close to Vladimir Putin for the purposes of setting up a line of communication between the Russian leader and Trump, according to U. S. Arab and European officials. The White House is already (sort of) denying that it has anything to do with this. \u201cWe are not aware of any meetings, and Erik Prince had no role in the transition,\u201d press secretary Sean Spicer said.",
        "Senate Democrats secured enough votes to filibuster the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U. S. Supreme Court on Monday, making it all but certain that Republicans will change the rules of the U. S. Senate to ensure his confirmation later this week. Democratic opposition to Gorsuch has been building for days, and four more senators announced on Monday that they would vote against him. That gives Democrats the requisite 41 senators to block a procedural vote and compel President Trump and Republicans either to withdraw Gorsuch\u2019s nomination or to change Senate rules to eliminate the requirement.",
        "Newly released records show the trust agreement that Donald Trump used to put his adult sons in charge of his company allows him to draw money from it upon his request, illustrating the thin divide between the president and his private fortune.

        "If you think there isn\u2019t enough extremism in American politics, this week\u2019s for you. If all goes as expected, the week will conclude with the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch as a Supreme Court justice. This outcome is lamentable. The seat was President Barack Obama\u2019s to fill, and Merrick Garland\u2019s to occupy. But as conservative as Gorsuch will likely turn out to be \u2014 belying his disingenuous claim that there is \u201cno such thing\u201d as Republican or Democratic judges \u2014 that\u2019s not the problem. The problem is how he\u2019ll almost certainly get there: Democrats will filibuster."
