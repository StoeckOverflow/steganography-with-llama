        "I\u2019ve finally figured out why the Trump administration is so dysfunctional. The White House needs a fool. Not the kind of fool that some believe already occupies the Oval Office. Rather, the kind \u2014 clad in motley, with a belled hat and one of those scepters topped with a tiny head (and perhaps tiny hands, for good measure). You know: a court jester, a harlequin, a clown. Someone to cartwheel around the West Wing, wisecracking and gobsmacking, speaking truth to power without fear of getting sacked.",
        "It was half past noon Monday when Chuck Grassley, the genial chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, asked for a show of hands: Did senators debating the Neil Gorsuch nomination to the Supreme Court want to break for lunch? Sen. Al Franken ( .) interjected with a parliamentary inquiry: \u201cCould the majority cater this lunch?\u201d Sen. John Cornyn ( .) spoke in the affirmative: \u201cI vote for plowing right through, Mr. Chairman. \u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar ( .) gave the proposition bipartisan support. The Republican chairman was flummoxed.",
        "Reading the accumulated sexual harassment accusations against Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly and former network executive Roger Ailes is like a quick dip in a sewage treatment pond. After even a brief exposure, the stench stays with you for days. If the accusations of dozens of women over two decades are correct \u2014 and it is hard to dismiss the women, as the accused have done, as unbalanced, dishonest or disgruntled \u2014 then Fox News is the focus of hypocrisy in the modern world.",
        "Jared Kushner is emerging as the smoothest, slickest operator in the Court of King Donald. He is also, by far, the busiest \u201d and the hardest to fire. President Trump is apparently convinced that his who serves officially as a senior adviser, can fix anything. Make that everything : In less than three months, Trump has given Kushner, 36, the following assignments: \u00e2 \u2014 ? Reinvent the federal government, one of the biggest and most complex organizations in the world. As head of the White House Office of American Innovation, ?",
        "THE STANDOFF over Judge Neil Gorsuch\u2019s Supreme Court nomination is the latest episode in a cycle of political retribution that has diminished the Senate and harmed the country. It nevertheless represents a depressing new low. Senator after senator acknowledges that the body is about to make a historic mistake, setting precedent and changing procedures in a way that will, over time, erode the quality of both the Senate and the judiciary. But few seem interested in defusing the dispute.",
        "Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s and senior adviser, is in Iraq as a White House envoy in a further expansion of his role as shadow diplomat. Kushner arrived in Iraq on Monday with Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who invited him on the trip, an official confirmed. The New York Times first reported that Kushner was on the trip. In a breach of protocol, senior White House officials confirmed reports of Kushner\u2019s trip before he had landed in Iraq, raising security concerns from the Pentagon. U. S.",
        "If you were bright and gifted in science and engineering the visa was your ticket to the United States. But maybe not for long. The lottery for such \u201c \u201d worker visas opened Monday, with the 85, 000 slots expected to fill in a matter of days. Nearly of the visas are expected to go to Indian workers, as they have in recent years. But the Trump administration injected new uncertainty into the visa process Monday warning employers against discriminating against U. S. workers and announcing site visits to companies that employ a high ratio of workers on visas.",
        "Over a period, top U. S. cyber defenders engaged in a pitched battle with Russian hackers who had breached the unclassified State Department computer system and displayed an unprecedented level of aggression that experts warn is likely to be turned against the private sector. Whenever National Security Agency hackers cut the attackers\u2019 link between their command and control server and the malware in the U. S. system, the Russians set up a new one, current and former U. S. officials said.",
        "Any expectation that Scott Pruitt, the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency, would be able to cruise through an appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d over the weekend was dashed within about 10 seconds of the interview. \u201cGood morning, Chris, how are you?\u201d Pruitt asked host Chris Wallace. That would be the softest question raised in the entire segment. \u201cGood,\u201d Wallace replied quickly.",
        "President Trump has chosen to donate his salary for the first quarter of the year \u2014 a total of $78, 333 \u2014 to the National Park Service, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in a briefing Monday afternoon. \u201cIt is every penny that the president received from the first quarter to the day,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cIt\u2019s from January 20th, noon, forward. \u201d Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who attended the news conference, said that the money would be put toward the maintenance of historic battlefields.",
        "Georgetown named Patrick Ewing its next men\u2019s basketball coach Monday, placing the program in the hands of its most decorated player and extending the legacy of former coach John Thompson Jr. who transformed the Hoyas into a national power starting in the 1980s. University President John J. DeGioia and Athletic Director Lee Reed announced the hire after meeting with Ewing, who had been an NBA assistant for the past 15 years, most recently with the Charlotte Hornets.",
        "A university in Connecticut is mourning the death of a student who died Sunday after apparently choking in a contest. A nursing student tried to save Caitlin Nelson, a junior who was a member of the Kappa Delta sorority at Sacred Heart University in Connecticut, when she showed signs of medical distress after eating several pancakes at the Greek Life event Thursday evening, according to Lt. Robert Kalamaras of the Fairfield Police. Officers responded within a minute of the 911 call, and Nelson was hospitalized and was in critical but stable condition that evening.",
        "Storm chasers who intentionally drove into the teeth of a tornado Sunday are now facing scathing blowback from their peers. The chasers got too close to the twister, the critics say, setting a dangerous example. Storm chasers converged in northern Louisiana on Sunday as the National Weather Service declared it a zone for violent thunderstorms. Later, the Weather Service posted a \u201cparticularly dangerous situation\u201d tornado watch \u2014 reserved for the rare circumstances in which conditions are favorable for the large, tornadoes that some chasers salivate over.",
        "A bridal shop in the town of Marneuli. (Myriam Meloni) Although the legal age of marriage in the country of Georgia in the Caucasus is 18, there is a tradition of girls marrying before then. The United Nations Population Fund has estimated that at least 17 percent of girls there get married before the age of 18. There are many reasons that these marriages still take place, including tradition, the will of the girl\u2019s parents and even kidnapping by a suitor.",
        "BEIRUT \u2014 Suspected chemical attacks in northern Syria on Tuesday left at least 58 people dead and scores struggling to breathe as Europe\u2019s top diplomat said the Syrian government bore \u201cprimary responsibility. \u201d The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring network, said a series of airstrikes in the northwestern town of Khan Sheikhoun appeared to involve a gas that caused people to choke, faint and foam at the mouth. The observatory said 11 children were among the dead. In the past, Syria forces have been accused of using weapons that cause similar symptoms.",
        "Trump administration officials and arch conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus have gotten off to a rocky start, driven at least in part by their mutual tendency to hear what they want to hear from the other side. Two weeks ago, as talks built to a dramatic failure of a Republican proposal to overhaul the nation\u2019s system, conservative lawmakers praised their discussions with President Trump\u2019s top advisers.",
        "The Senate Intelligence Committee chairman is not ruling out interviewing former national security adviser Susan Rice over allegations that she sought to have the identities of President Trump and members of his transition team revealed in foreign surveillance reports. \u201cIf the reports are right,\u201d Chairman Richard Burr ( . C.) said on Tuesday, \u201cthen she will be of interest to us.",
        "An advertiser boycott against Fox News\u2019s Bill O\u2019Reilly picked up dramatic speed Tuesday in a reaction to the news that the outspoken host has been the subject of a succession of allegations over the past 15 years. At least 11 companies, including leading car, financial and pharmaceutical advertisers, confirmed that they had pulled ads or planned to shift upcoming ads away from \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d in the wake of reports that O\u2019Reilly and Fox had settled five complaints made by women who have worked with him at the news network since 2002.",
        "The Senate plowed Tuesday toward a historic and bitter showdown over President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, with a parade of lawmakers taking to the Senate floor to deliver politically charged speeches for and against the president\u2019s pick as a final vote neared. There was no sign of compromise as the chamber formally opened debate on Judge Neil Gorsuch, who Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell predicted will be confirmed on Friday before senators leave town for the Easter recess.",
        "If there is one operative rule in Washington\u2019s paradigm, it is to shift the focus of any conversation that seems at risk of revealing something approximating truth \u2014 a game at which the current administration and its media surrogates happen to excel. Thus, the focus early this week was on the \u201cunmasking\u201d of Trump campaign and transition team members who turned up in surveilled communications with foreigners. This unmasking (the naming of said team members) loosely corresponds to President Trump\u2019s claim that President Barack Obama was wiretapping him during the transition. This history is familiar by now.",
        "The Trump presidency will end in calamity. By definition. I know this because the dictionary says so. When John Dean of Watergate fame predicted \u201ccalamity\u201d for Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, \u2019s official account tweeted about the prognostication, adding its definition: \u201can event that causes great harm and suffering. \u201d If you are unaccustomed to finding such information in the dictionary, you haven\u2019t been keeping up with the new which has been throwing the book \u2014 definition: \u201cto punish (someone) as severely as possible\u201d \u2014 at Trump.",
        "Ajit Pai is chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. Maureen Ohlhausen is acting chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. April Fools\u2019 Day came early last week, as professional lobbyists lit a wildfire of misinformation about Congress\u2019s action \u2014 signed into law Monday by President Trump \u2014 to nullify the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s broadband privacy rules. So as the nation\u2019s chief communications regulator and the nation\u2019s chief privacy enforcer, we want to let the American people know what\u2019s really going on and how we will ensure that consumers\u2019 online privacy is protected.",
        "When Gen. Michael Hayden visited a secret intelligence facility in the United States a decade ago while he was CIA director, the staff gave him a emblazoned with the words \u201cAdmit Nothing. Deny Everything. Make Counter Accusations. \u201d That motto is by covert operators. It also seems to be President Trump\u2019s rubric for responding to the FBI investigation of whether any members of his campaign team cooperated with Russian hackers. Maybe it\u2019s becoming our national slogan. There are now competing narratives for any issue that touches Russia or intelligence.",
        "\u201cWhan that Aprille up in Minnesota the drought of March hath pierced to the roote and bathed every vein in sweet liqueur which makes the corn grow, and it helps to use manure,\u201d wrote Chaucer, or words to that effect. Winter is brutal, dark, cold, we fall into the slough of despond, and now this year, as a bonus, a flu virus is going around that causes vomiting, low and what your grandpa called \u201cthe trots.",
        "PERHAPS IT is just a coincidence that the worst chemical weapons attack in Syria since 2013 came only a few days after the Trump administration confirmed that it would not seek to remove dictator Bashar from power. Like Sen. John McCain ( .) we suspect not. Either way, the horrific assault Tuesday on a town will test whether President Trump will tolerate flagrant crimes against humanity by the Assad regime. So far, the signs are not good. Though not all the facts are in, the early evidence reported from the scene was ominous.",
        "Two days after the November election, leaders of President Trump\u2019s transition team presented his inner circle with more than 100 names of candidates for key Cabinet and other senior positions in the new administration. Missing from the list for the post of national security adviser was retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, according to two knowledgeable officials. Flynn was a loyalist who had a close relationship with Trump. It was obvious to the transition team that Trump would give him a prominent appointment.",
        "Immigration agents may arrest crime victims and witnesses at courthouses, a homeland security official said Tuesday, highlighting a growing dispute between the Trump administration and some state court officials who fear the practice will hinder law enforcement work in their jurisdictions. \u201cJust because they\u2019re a victim in a certain case does not mean there\u2019s not something in their background that could cause them to be a removable alien,\u2019\u2019 David Lapan, a Department of Homeland Security spokesman, said in a briefing to reporters. \u201cJust because they\u2019re a witness doesn\u2019t mean they might not pose a security threat for other reasons.",
        "Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, resigned from his post effective Tuesday, after revealing he\u2019d played a role in a leak of sensitive information to a financial analyst several years ago. In a statement, Lacker said he spoke on Oct. 2, 2012, with an analyst at Medley Global Advisors, a macroeconomic research firm owned by the Financial Times Limited. The analyst asked about policy decisions. \u201cDue to the highly confidential and sensitive nature of this information, I should have declined to comment and perhaps have ended the phone call.",
        "SEOUL \u2014 North Korea fired another ballistic missile Wednesday morning, military officials in the United States and South Korea said, apparently testing a version of its rocket that can be fired from a submarine. However, this missile flew only a short distance. The launch comes days after Pyongyang said it planned to mark two key anniversaries this month as \u201cbig\u201d political events and days before President Trump meets with China\u2019s Xi Jinping \u2014 with North Korea at the top of the agenda.",
        "\u201cWhen you look for a job, you can\u2019t find it and you give up, you are now considered statistically employed. But I don\u2019t consider those people employed. \u201d \u2014 President Trump, remarks to CEO town hall, April 4, 2017 The president made these comments as he described the method of calculating the unemployment rate as \u201cridiculous. \u201d Since no one at the White House, apparently, has explained to the president how the unemployment rate is calculated, here\u2019s a quick and easy briefing. Spoiler alert: It\u2019s exactly the opposite of what Trump said."
