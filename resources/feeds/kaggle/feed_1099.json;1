        "The philanthropy established by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar will contribute $100 million to support investigative journalism, fight misinformation and counteract hate speech around the world. One of the first contributions, $4. 5 million, will go to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) the group behind last year\u2019s Panama Papers investigation, which revealed offshore businesses and shell corporations, some of which were used for purposes such as tax evasion.",
        "How would you feel about having a microchip implanted in your hand to make things more convenient at work? In Sweden, some workers are actually volunteering to do just that, electing to have a chip the size of a grain of rice implanted in their bodies to help them unlock doors, operate printers, open storage lockers and even buy smoothies with the wave of their hand, according to an Associated Press report.",
        "Today, the serene waters of Lake Nemi make it a quaint getaway, one that is best known for its peaceful landscapes and the area\u2019s delicious wild strawberries. But in ancient Roman times, the volcanic lake southeast of Rome was the anchor point for Emperor Caligula\u2019s pleasure ships \u2014 massive and ornate barges that were rumored to be the sites of wild orgies and other excessive indulgences. For nearly 2, 000 years, the sunken remains of Caligula\u2019s pleasure ships tantalized divers, who launched expeditions to recover them, with little success.",
        "President Trump has vowed to follow a radically new approach to foreign policy that jettisons the costly mantle of moral leadership in favor of America\u2019s most immediate economic and security interests. This week, crises in Syria and North Korea have put Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy to perhaps its biggest test. On Wednesday, the president stood next to Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II in the Rose Garden and delivered a statement on the brutal chemical weapons attack in Syria that sounded as though it could have been given by any one of his recent predecessors in office.",
        "A chemical attack in Syria that killed scores of civilians, including children, \u201ccrossed a lot of lines for me,\u201d President Trump said Wednesday, adding that he is now responsible for trying to end a grinding conflict he blamed his predecessor for prolonging. Unlike his U. N. envoy, Trump did not mention Russia and its culpability for backing Syrian President Bashar whose government blamed the chemical release on rebel forces. \u201cWhen you kill innocent children, innocent babies \u2014 babies! \u2014 little babies,\u201d Trump said, \u201cthat crosses many, many lines. Beyond a red line, many, many lines.",
        "BEIRUT \u2014 A chemical attack that killed scores of civilians in Syria probably involved a banned nerve agent, top medical groups concluded Wednesday, as the United States and European allies at the U. N. Security Council demanded an investigation. The attack on the northwestern town of Khan Sheikhoun on Tuesday was the deadliest chemical assault on a civilian population in Syria since government forces attacked suburbs of Damascus with sarin nerve agent in 2013.",
        "President Trump on Wednesday removed controversial White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon from the National Security Council, part of a sweeping staff reshuffling that elevated military, intelligence and Cabinet officials to greater roles on the council and left Bannon less directly involved in shaping the administration\u2019s national security policy. The restructuring reflects the growing influence of national security adviser H. R. McMaster, an Army general who took over the post after retired general Michael Flynn was ousted in February and who is increasingly asserting himself over the flow of national security information in the White House.",
        "The \u201cnuclear\u201d showdown in the Senate has split the chamber\u2019s most senior Republicans over how bad the fallout will be. On one side is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) who says that once Democrats filibuster Judge Neil Gorsuch, the GOP\u2019s unilateral response to confirm him on a simple majority vote will take senators \u201cback to what was the tradition in the Senate\u201d for confirming Supreme Court justices. It will be, McConnell says, a good thing for the Senate.",
        "Republican leaders in the Senate have made it clear that Judge Neil Gorsuch will be confirmed to the Supreme Court, even if Democrats successfully block their efforts. This will require changing the Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations altogether. You have probably heard this described as the \u201cnuclear option. \u201d A rules change might sound simple, but like most matters of Senate procedure, the process is not.",
        "Why are Democrats filibustering Judge Neil Gorsuch? Because they\u2019ve had enough with the politics of and bullying. At the root of this fight is a conservative effort to dominate the Supreme Court and turn it to the political objectives of the right. This is thus about far more than retaliation, however understandable, for the Senate Republicans\u2019 refusal to give even a hearing to Judge Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee for the seat Gorsuch would fill. Behind the current judicial struggle lies a series of highly politicized Supreme Court rulings. It started with Bush v.",
        "Impulse control is unfashionable as well as unpresidential, but perhaps you should resist the urge to trip people who stride briskly down the sidewalk fixated on their phone screens, absorbed in texting and feeling entitled to expect others to make way. New technologies are shaping behaviors and dissolving civilities. In 2005, Lynne Truss, in her book \u201cTalk to the Hand: The Utter Bloody Rudeness of the World Today, or Six Good Reasons to Stay Home and Bolt the Door,\u201d presciently said we were slouching into \u201can age of social autism\u201d with a \u201cUniversal Reflex.",
        "\u201cI inherited a mess!\u201d President Trump complained at a news conference with Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II on Wednesday afternoon. For the second day in a row, he blamed the Obama administration for Tuesday\u2019s chemical weapons attack by Syria\u2019s Assad regime and, for good measure, he blamed his predecessor for \u201cone of the worst deals I have ever witnessed,\u201d with Iran. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the Middle East, whether it\u2019s North Korea, whether it\u2019s so many other things, whether it\u2019s in our country, horrible trade deals \u2014 I inherited a mess,\u201d he repeated. No, Mr.",
        "Robert D. Atkinson is president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. Of all the issues that will be on the table when President Trump hosts Chinese President Xi Jinping this week at his resort in Florida, none is more important for the U. S. and global economies than China\u2019s mercantilist campaign to dominate advanced industries by flouting the rules of the international trading system. China has been its competitors and has received in return only the occasional sheepish rebuke at ministerial dialogues.",
        "Bashar and Vladimir Putin are responsible for the Syrian genocidal war, including a series of apparent chemical attacks on innocents. Indeed, they are war criminals by any definition, having, among other things, deliberately targeted civilians and aid workers. President Barack Obama and his advisers who indulged in excuse after excuse to avoid action will have a blot on their record that is permanent and damning. Responsibility goes to Republicans and Democrats alike who opposed the use of force in defense of the \u201cred line,\u201d thereby facilitating Obama\u2019s . These include everyone from Sen. Marco Rubio ( .) to Sen.",
        "DESPITE COCKAMAMIE conservative conspiracy theories, actual cases of intentional or even possibly intentional voting fraud are so rare in the United States that when one does crop up, Republicans get themselves in a lather. That explains the ugly tone of and retribution attending the scapegoating of Rosa Ortega, whose sentence of eight years in prison for voting illegally in Texas is a travesty of justice. Eight years, really? That falls in the midrange of sentences for felonies in Texas, which include manslaughter, aggravated assault, sexual assault, possession of up to 2, 000 pounds of marijuana and human trafficking.",
        "House Republicans indicated Wednesday that they would leave Washington this week without passing their stalled bill, spurning a spirited White House effort to revive the legislation amid a fresh round of intraparty . Three top GOP leaders each dialed back expectations for action before a recess begins Thursday, after a meeting of holdout factions led by Vice President Pence on Tuesday failed to produce a breakthrough. \u201cWe can keep working this for weeks now,\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) said Wednesday morning, emphasizing that there was \u201cno artificial deadline\u201d for action. \u201cGetting this done by tomorrow?",
        "President Trump suggested without evidence Wednesday that Susan E. Rice, former national security adviser in his predecessor\u2019s administration, may have committed a crime in requesting the identities of Trump campaign associates that were contained in classified intelligence reports. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be the biggest story,\u201d Trump told the New York Times in an interview at the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s such an important story for our country and the world. It is one of the big stories of our time. \u201d \u201cDo I think? Yes, I think,\u201d he said, when asked whether Rice had committed a crime.",
        "Whatever happens to Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s career, one aspect of this unrelenting story line at Fox News deserves to be put to rest forever. Let\u2019s call it the \u201chotline defense. \u201d That\u2019s the ludicrous idea that a woman who is being sexually harassed, within a company known to be rife with misogyny, would choose to call an internal hotline to make her complaint.",
        "The Internal Revenue Service has seized millions of dollars in cash from individuals and businesses that obtained the money legally, according to a new Treasury Department inspector general\u2019s report. The report covers IRS cash seizures against businesses and individuals suspected of deliberately trying to avoid federal reporting requirements for large bank deposits. To combat criminal activity, individuals and businesses are required to report all bank deposits greater than $10, 000 to federal authorities.",
        "Nearly four decades after he derailed a pioneering transgender program at Johns Hopkins Hospital with his views on \u201c homosexual men,\u201d psychiatrist Paul McHugh is seeing his institution come full circle with the resumption of surgeries. McHugh, the hospital\u2019s chief of psychiatry from 1975 to 2001, still believes that being transgender is largely a psychological problem, not a biological phenomenon. And with the title of university distinguished service professor at Johns Hopkins Medicine, he continues to wield enormous influence in certain circles and is quoted frequently on gender issues in conservative media.",
        "SEOUL \u2014 North Korea has made no secret of its desire to build an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, capable of reaching the continental United States. In his New Year\u2019s Day address, Kim Jong Un said that North Korea has \u201centered the final stage of preparation for a of an intercontinental ballistic missile. \u201d In response, President Trump tweeted: \u201cIt won\u2019t happen!\u201d North Korea has quite a track record when it comes to making bold threats it can\u2019t deliver on, but many analysts take Pyongyang at its word.",
        "The official portrait of first lady Melania Trump is jarring because her face appears to be heavily retouched, or perhaps just photographed through a lens smeared with Vaseline. It is devoid of fine lines and pores. It is not just the face of a former model; it is a face that does not look real. The artificiality of her visage is even more acute when compared to the long, chestnut locks that frame it. You don\u2019t have to squint to make out individual strands of hair. The hair is in sharp focus. Her face is not.",
        "By its very nature, the black hole at the heart of our galaxy is impossible to spot. Its overwhelming gravity allows nothing to escape, not even light. Massive enough to send shivers through itself, yet perfectly invisible, it lurks in the darkness like a monster from a child\u2019s nightmare \u2014 felt but unseen. It is the stuff of physicists\u2019 wildest dreams. \u201cBlack holes are basically the most mysterious objects in the cosmos,\u201d said Shep Doeleman, an astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics.",
        "Senators voted on Thursday to advance Judge Neil Gorsuch\u2019s nomination to serve on the U. S. Supreme Court, setting up a final confirmation vote on Friday. By a vote of to 55 to 45, all Republicans and three Democrats voted to proceed to final debate on the nomination of Gorsuch, 49, a judge on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. If confirmed, Gorsuch would replace the late Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia, who died unexpectedly last year, sparking a more than feud among senators about the future makeup of the high court.",
        "The Trump administration is weighing military retaliation against the Syrian government following a chemical attack Tuesday that killed scores of civilians, but it is complicated by the presence of Russian forces in the country and concerns about U. S. troops deployed in Syria in the campaign against the Islamic State, according to U. S. officials. The Pentagon is in the process of presenting options to the White House on potential military responses, which could include strikes on Syrian military targets and actions designed to ground the Syrian air force.",
        "House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes ( .) temporarily recused himself Thursday from all matters related to the committee\u2019s ongoing probe into Russian interference in the presidential election, as House investigators look into ethics charges against him. The House Ethics Committee released a statement Thursday saying it had \u201cdetermined to investigate\u201d allegations that \u201cNunes may have made unauthorized disclosures of classified information, in violation of House Rules, law, regulations, or other standards of conduct. \u201d Nunes denied the charges as \u201centirely false and politically motivated,\u201d blaming \u201cseveral leftwing activist groups\u201d for filing complaints with the Office of Congressional Ethics.",
        "Twitter filed a lawsuit Thursday against the U. S. Department of Homeland Security, asking the court to prevent the department from taking steps to unmask the user behind an account critical of the Trump administration. The tech company said that allowing DHS access to that information would produce a \u201cgrave chilling effect on the speech of that account,\u201d as well as other accounts critical of the U. S. government. The case sets up a potential showdown over free speech between Silicon Valley and Washington.",
        "Don Rickles, the irrepressible master of the comic insult whose humor was a litany of mockery in which members of his audience were the (usually) willing victims of his verbal assaults, died April 6 at his home Los Angeles. He was 90. The cause was kidney failure, said his publicist, Paul Shefrin. When Mr. Rickles developed his act in the 1950s, his humor was considered shocking, with a raw, abrasive, deeply personal edge.",
        "Tom Cotton, a Republican, represents Arkansas in the U. S. Senate. Gen. Paul Selva recently became the first Pentagon official to state publicly that Russia has deployed a cruise missile in direct violation of its treaty obligations to the United States. Selva, who serves as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in testimony before the House Armed Services Committee: \u201cWe believe that the Russians have deliberately deployed it in order to pose a threat to NATO.",
        "There\u2019s plenty to unpack in Pepsi\u2019s carbonated hot mess of an ad that was released Tuesday, pulled Wednesday and probably will be hated and ridiculed for years to come. For those who have not seen it, it can be viewed here because the Internet never forgets a good marketing fail."
