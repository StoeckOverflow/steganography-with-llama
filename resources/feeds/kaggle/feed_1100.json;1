        "Stephen K. Bannon broke the cardinal rule of office politics: Don\u2019t insult the boss\u2019s relatives. Bannon\u2019s inability to behave professionally and civilly \u2014 in other words, his preference for imitating President Trump\u2019s behavior \u2014 may spell doom. Wednesday he was booted from the National Security Council. Rather than go quietly, he issued a gobbledygook pronouncement that sounded like one of Sean Spicer\u2019s word salads. \u201cSusan Rice operationalized the NSC during the last administration. I was put on to ensure that it was \u201d he said.",
        "Bob Dole, a Republican from Kansas, was the Senate majority leader from 1985 to 1987 and 1995 to 1996 and the Republican nominee for president in 1996. Trent Lott, a Republican from Mississippi, was Senate majority leader from 1996 to 2001. For weeks now we have heard the erroneous claim that Supreme Court nominees require 60 votes for Senate confirmation, rather than a simple majority. In reality, the Constitution and precedent require nothing of the kind. Now it is time to end the farce and call the roll.",
        "A month ago, Rep. Devin Nunes was a member of the House of Representatives, with no national profile and little to distinguish him from his 434 colleagues. But today, he\u2019s the most visible manifestation of the the comprehensive and at times comical effort by the administration, Republicans in Congress, and the conservative media to protect Donald Trump. And it all happened because of a couple of inane and false tweets the president sent. There\u2019s a larger picture to be understood here, about where this investigation will go and the methods parties use to advance their political aims.",
        "Since Jan. 20, Washington has received ample indication that nothing is the same anymore. There\u2019s been a press briefing merely to berate the media about its coverage of inauguration crowds; there have been presidential tweets about a reality TV show; \u201cFox & Friends\u201d finally has someone who takes it seriously. And yet! Perhaps no indicator that the media has veered into terra incognita Trumpi is more sturdy than ratings from the past several weeks. So have been these numbers over many, many years that they\u2019ve been barely worth glimpsing.",
        "PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 President Trump welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping here Thursday at his estate, kicking off a summit that U. S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said would include \u201cvery frank discussions\u201d over North Korea and trade. Speaking to reporters after greeting Xi at the airport, Tillerson said the U. S. side would press the Chinese delegation to \u201cfind ways to exercise influence on North Korea\u2019s actions to dismantle their nuclear weapons and their missile technology program.",
        "President Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, is no longer part of the National Security Council. Instead, he now belongs to a different club \u2014 one composed of White House aides who have been the subjects of anonymously sourced media reports about diminished standing. The New York Times, citing unnamed \u201cWhite House officials,\u201d reported on Thursday\u2019s front page that Bannon has become \u201cincreasingly embattled\u201d and \u201chas been conspicuously absent from some meetings. \u201d Multiple news outlets reported that Bannon has grown so frustrated by his marginalization that he recently threatened to quit.",
        "Fox News and its star host Bill O\u2019Reilly appear to have developed a strategy in response to allegations of serial sexual harassment and the mass defections of advertisers from O\u2019Reilly\u2019s program: Say as little as possible. The voluble TV personality has said nothing on the air about the controversy since it broke over the weekend. Fox News has all but ignored any reporting about it in its broadcasts and on its website; its one acknowledgment was a summary on its \u201cMedia Buzz\u201d program on Sunday. It has not mentioned the advertiser reaction.",
        "House Republican leaders moved to modify their stalled bill Thursday after Vice President Pence pressured them to show progress toward passing the bill before lawmakers leave for a recess. On Thursday morning, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) invited more than 20 fellow Republicans to his weekly news conference to unveil an amendment aimed at addressing coverage for sicker Americans in what appeared to be an effort to show progress toward an accord.",
        "\u201cNepotism,\u201d Eric Trump recently told Forbes, \u201cis kind of a factor of life. \u201d The businessman was talking about how his father had handed over a enterprise to his sons and was making what the magazine dubbed \u201cSurprisingly Candid Thoughts On Nepotism. \u201d \u201cWe might be here because of nepotism, but we\u2019re not still here because of nepotism,\u201d he told Forbes. \u201cYou know, if we didn\u2019t do a good job, if we weren\u2019t competent, believe me, we wouldn\u2019t be in this spot. \u201d Why? Because Eric Trump said his father, the president, \u201cexpects people to perform.",
        "It is a tale of two photographs, one light and airy, the other kind of, well, dark. On Wednesday, the feature photograph on the Bureau of Land Management\u2019s homepage was an idyllic shot of what appears to be a sunrise over pretty green bluff, witnessed by a pair of backpackers. But seemingly overnight, there was a noticeable change. Gone were the boy and man from the wild land that the BLM controls, and in its place was coal. A great wall of carbon literally blacked out the old sunny view. Screen grab.",
        "Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen said Thursday the information of up to 100, 000 taxpayers may have been stolen in a security breach of an online tool used to apply for federal student aid. Testifying before the Senate Finance Committee, Koskinen said the IRS identified suspicious activity in the files of people who were using a \u201cdata retrieval tool\u201d as they filled out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. FAFSA is the form the government and colleges use to determine financial aid for millions of students.",
        "President Trump is considering whether to issue a tremendous amount of government debt to finance a $1 trillion investment in U. S. infrastructure, which would mark a major break from his campaign pledge to attract large quantities of private money to finance upgrades to roads, bridges, ports and numerous other facilities. Trump\u2019s new view is that the United States can borrow money so cheaply now because of low interest rates that it makes sense to borrow the money, according to comments he made in an interview with the New York Times.",
        "I\u2019m a solo female travel blogger on a mission to complete 12 trips in 12 months. I want to accomplish this personal feat before I turn the big . As a young professional, I\u2019m on a tight budget. The most expensive part of any trip is the flight, so I had to find cheap airfare to meet my travel goals. Stops on my year of adventure include the South of France during lavender season, Mexico during whale shark season and Iceland during the autumnal equinox. So far, I\u2019ve booked 11 of the 12 trips, most for under $400 .",
        "Lyudmila Putin was the wife of Vladimir Putin for three decades. They met in Leningrad, married in 1983 and moved to East Germany, where her husband was a KGB spy. When the Iron Curtain crumbled, they returned to Russia, where Vladimir Putin began his remarkable journey to becoming the most powerful person in the country, if not on the planet. But as Vladimir reigned in Moscow, Lyudmila was seen less and less in public. Wild rumors in the Russian press suggested that he had packed her off to a monastery.",
        "Ocarina, 10, loves to read and is rarely without a book in hand. She is along with her sisters, but may enter the public school system within the next year. (Parker ) Colleen and Jamie Smith are raising a family in an old, schoolhouse without running water in the Missouri woods. It\u2019s the kind of place not easily found by typing an address into a smartphone. As technology and social media increasingly tighten their grip on the American way of life, it often requires a conscious choice to live a more simple life.",
        "The Trump administration on Friday defended its strikes against Syrian military targets overnight, while Russia and Syria slammed the attacks and warned they would provoke more terrorism and instability in the region. From the United Nations to Capitol Hill to the Pentagon, U. S. officials said the attacks were justified in targeting the Shayrat air base that was used to launch a chemical weapons attack that killed scores of men, women and children in Syria\u2019s Idlib province Tuesday. \u201cIt is in our vital national interest to prevent the use and spread of chemical weapons,\u201d Nikki Haley, the U. S.",
        "Even before President Trump ordered a cruise missile strike against Russia\u2019s leading ally in the Middle East, Moscow had reasons to think that his campaign promise of a new dawn in U. S. relations was fading.",
        "BEIRUT \u2014 Just a few days ago, Syrian President Bashar looked like he had little to fear. After six years of war, his army had penned what remained of Syria\u2019s armed rebellion into shrinking swaths of territory, and European leaders were preparing for a conference that could fund the reconstruction of his country. That sense of security appeared shaken Friday after the U. S. military launched a raft of missile strikes at a Syrian military airfield in retaliation for a chemical attack that killed scores of civilians on Tuesday.",
        "Sean Spicer had another awkward moment at Friday\u2019s media briefing at and it was a completely avoidable one. The White House staff let broadcast cameras set up in a makeshift briefing room at President Trump\u2019s Florida estate on Friday, expecting a briefing to start soon. And, as they do most weekdays, television networks teased the upcoming briefing, with text graphics or small video boxes showing the empty lectern ahead of Spicer\u2019s arrival. But almost as soon as he arrived at the lectern, Spicer demanded the cameras be turned off. \u201cOff,\u201d he said, making a \u201ccutoff\u201d sign with his hands.",
        "BEIJING \u2014 The Donald Jinping summit was off to a good start: Xi nailed the handshake. Trump cracked a joke. And they dined on Dover sole with champagne sauce and New York strip steak, not the Big Mac that Trump once vowed to serve. But as Presidents Trump and Xi scooped sorbet and sipped wine ahead of talks on North Korea, trade and other issues, the U. S. military fired 59 missiles at a Syrian airfield in retaliation for a recent chemical attack that killed scores of civilians.",
        "Congress offered a mix of reactions on Friday to President Trump\u2019s military action in Syria, with many lawmakers welcoming the airstrikes, some lambasting Trump for failing to seek congressional approval, and nearly all calling for more information and collaboration from the White House. Friday\u2019s operation, the first direct U. S. assault on the Syrian government in six years of bloody civil war, surprised members as they prepared to leave Washington for a recess and reignited a debate over the legality of U. S. military actionthat lacks explicit approval from Congress.",
        "For hours, the Trump Internet warned that their president was being tricked. Mike Cernovich and Alex Jones s Infowars  \u201d both\u00c2 have earned praise from President Trump or those close to him in the recent past  \u201d promoted a conspiracy theory all day Thursday that blamed the U. S. deep state for a suspected nerve agent attack Tuesday in Syria, and not the Assad regime. Infowars called the attack",
        "Newly confirmed Neil M. Gorsuch is likely to have an immediate impact at the Supreme Court, weighing in as early as next week on whether to consider expanding the breadth of the Second Amendment. He could play a decisive role this spring in determining how voting rights should be protected and in a major case on the separation of church and state. The Senate voted 54 to 45 on Friday to confirm Gorsuch, ending more than a year of bitter partisan conflict over the ideological balance of the nation\u2019s highest court.",
        "The U. S. Senate confirmed Neil M. Gorsuch to serve on the U. S. Supreme Court, capping more than a year of bitter partisan bickering over the ideological balance of the nation\u2019s highest court. On a vote of 54 to 45, senators confirmed Gorsuch, 49, a judge on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. He will become the 113th person to serve on the Supreme Court and is scheduled to be sworn in Monday.",
        "Mitch McConnell, a Republican, represents Kentucky in the Senate and is majority leader. The day after Neil Gorsuch\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court was announced, I wrote about his sterling credentials, record of independence and long history of bipartisan support \u2014 and predicted they would matter little to special interests that invariably oppose the Supreme Court nominees of any Republican president. I asked Democrats to ignore those extreme voices and their attacks and join us instead in giving Gorsuch fair consideration and an vote, as we did for the Supreme Court nominees of Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.",
        "\u201cNo majority leader wants written on his tombstone that he presided over the end of the Senate,\u201d the minority leader said. He continued: \u201cBreaking the rules to change the rules is . I just hope the majority leader thinks about his legacy, the future of his party, and, most importantly, the future of our country before he acts. \u201d Are these the words of Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( . Y.) as the Republican majority changed Senate rules this week to do away with filibusters of Supreme Court nominations?",
        "Alyssa Rosenberg writes The Post\u2019s Act Four blog about politics and culture. If you\u2019d designed her in a lab, you could not have produced a more highly optimized first daughter than Ivanka Trump. Her wardrobe is stylish but not risky. She\u2019s an mother of three young children. She works, but for her father, recasting ambition as fidelity to family. When her father was elected president, Trump disavowed any intention of joining his administration, insisting demurely, \u201cI\u2019m going to be a daughter.",
        "American missile strikes against Syria are a critical first step toward protecting civilians from the threat of chemical weapons, and President Trump deserves credit for doing what the Obama administration refused to do. But Thursday\u2019s action needs to be just the opening salvo in a broader campaign not only to protect the Syrian people from the brutality of the Bashar regime but also to reverse the downward spiral of U. S. power and influence in the Middle East and throughout the world.",
        "George W. Bush served as 43rd president of the United States and founded the George W. Bush Institute in Dallas. Last week in Gaborone, Botswana, Laura and I sat in a small room in Tlokweng Main Clinic, a facility that recently started screening and treating women for cervical cancer. Seated with us was Leithailwe Wale, a woman who was diagnosed with the disease. Thanks to early detection and access to treatment, she told us, today she is alive, healthy and able to raise her son.",
        "MUCH LIKE Anita Hill\u2019s 1991 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about being sexually harassed, allegations of serial misconduct by Bill O\u2019Reilly can be seen two ways. Ms. Hill\u2019s riveting testimony did not stop the Supreme Court confirmation of Clarence Thomas, who denied the charges, but it brought sexual harassment to the forefront of national attention. Similarly, disclosure of about $13 million in payouts to settle the claims of five women who said they were harassed by Mr. O\u2019Reilly has yet to derail the Fox News host\u2019s career."
