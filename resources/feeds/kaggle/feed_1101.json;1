        "A federal judge on Friday approved a plan to reform the Baltimore Police Department, a day after a stream of residents urged him to reject attempts by the U. S. Department of Justice to delay a consent agreement with the city. U. S. District Judge James K. Bredar rejected the postponement request, noting the agreement had already been signed by the government and Baltimore. \u201cAs between the parties, this case is settled,\u201d Bredar wrote in the ruling issued Friday.",
        "STOCKHOLM \u2014 A stolen truck plowed into a department store Friday in central Stockholm, killing at least four people and touching off a major manhunt after what the country\u2019s prime minister described as a likely terrorist attack. Police said the driver apparently escaped and was the subject of a rapidly widening search. Heavily armed officers patrolled the streets, and police helicopters buzzed overhead. Police announced Friday evening that officers had arrested a man who matched the description of an individual they had asked the public to help locate.",
        "MOUNT STERLING, Ky. \u2014 Jolene Jouett took a short puff from her cigarette and looked out the window at the neighborhood she has known her entire life. She spoke aloud to herself, repeating the question: How had it changed these past 60 years? Nestled around the DuBois Community Center, this predominantly black neighborhood is just a short distance from the rest of timeworn Mount Sterling, a Kentucky town of several thousand people.",
        "The White House is taking steps that could open up new areas of the Atlantic and Arctic oceans to offshore oil and gas drilling, according to multiple individuals briefed on the proposal. The White House is considering an executive order instructing the Interior Department to reverse President Barack Obama\u2019s withdrawal of hundreds of millions of offshore acres from future drilling in December.",
        "Arkansas is preparing to execute seven death row inmates in 11 days this month before the state\u2019s deadly drugs expire, an unprecedented number of lethal injections in such a narrow Virginia passed such a law last year. Most executions are carried out with little public notice, but the scheduling in Arkansas has drawn remarkable national scrutiny and criticism for the executions being scheduled on four days in an span. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything close to that,\u201d said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit group.",
        "Amid a troop of monkeys in the Katraniaghat forest range in northern India roamed a naked human girl, playing with the primates as if she were one of them. She looked emaciated, her hair disheveled. But she appeared to be in a comfortable state, until the police arrived. A group of woodcutters had alerted authorities after spotting the girl, believed to be 10 to 12 years old.",
        "An artist\u2019s conception of the exoplanet GJ 1132b, which orbits the red dwarf star GJ 1132. Astronomers have managed to detect the atmosphere of this Earthlike planet. (MPIA) There are a lot of good reasons to be captivated by the exoplanet GJ 1132b. Located in the constellation Vela, it\u2019s a mere 39 from Earth \u2014 just a hop, skip and a jump in galactic terms. It\u2019s similar to Earth in terms of size and mass, and it dances in a orbit around its star, a dimly burning red dwarf. And, astronomers recently discovered, it has an atmosphere.",
        "(Photo by David Freund) Like many photographers, David Freund was attracted to photography at a young age. As a boy in Iowa during the 1940s, he would take his Brownie camera and hunt for images. But as the child of a man who operated a Sinclair oil station in Ottumwa, Iowa, Freund would soon realize he didn\u2019t have to look far for his first subject. Nowadays, some 70 years later, Freund estimates he has photographed thousands, if not tens of thousands, of gas stations across America. \u201cNobody goes to a gas station to take photos,\u201d he says.",
        "PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 President Trump on Saturday praised the U. S. military for carrying out the missile attack on a Syrian airfield and struck back at mounting questions over whether it would help achieve a momentum shift in Syria\u2019s bloody civil war. In an afternoon tweet, Trump defended the operation against criticism from some members of Congress and military analysts that the nighttime volley of 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles two days earlier did not target the runways at the Shayrat air base in eastern Syria.",
        "BEIRUT \u2014 Residents of the Syrian town devastated by a chemical weapons attack earlier this week said warplanes had returned to bomb them Saturday, despite a U. S. missile barrage and warnings of possible further response. At least 86 people in the northwestern town of Khan Sheikhoun were killed Tuesday in a chemical attack that left hundreds choking, fitting or foaming at the mouth. Eyewitnesses and a monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said Saturday that fresh attacks on the area \u2014 now a virtual ghost town \u2014 had killed one woman and wounded several others.",
        "When President Trump began receiving his intelligence briefings in January, his team made a request: The president, they said, was a visual and auditory learner. Would the briefers please cut down on the number of words in the daily briefing book and instead use more graphics and pictures? Similarly, after Trump entered office, his staff took President Barack Obama\u2019s Syria contingency plans and broke the intelligence down into bites, complete with photos, according to current and former U. S. officials with knowledge of the request.",
        "The cruise missiles struck, and many in the mainstream media fawned. \u201cI think Donald Trump became president of the United States last night,\u201d declared Fareed Zakaria on CNN, after the firing of 59 missiles at a Syrian military airfield late Thursday night. (His words sounded familiar, since CNN\u2019s Van Jones made a nearly identical pronouncement after Trump\u2019s first address to Congress.) \u201cOn Syria attack, Trump\u2019s heart came first,\u201d read a New York Times headline.",
        "President Trump found himself in unfamiliar territory Friday, generally praised by members of the political and foreign policy establishments but attacked from some quarters of Trump nation for seeming to betray the \u201cAmerica First\u201d pledges that carried him to the White House. Trump\u2019s decision to fire cruise missiles at a Syrian air base in response to Tuesday\u2019s chemical weapons attack against civilians won support from some people he had routinely disparaged over the past year, among them Sen. John McCain ( .) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( . Y.). Hours before the U. S.",
        "A volley of U. S. cruise missiles had barely been launched into Syria before the Internet filled up with theories about the real reason for an international crisis. A popular one on the fringes: The U. S. government actually carried out the chemical weapons massacre in Syria last week \u2014 a \u201cfalse flag\u201d to trick President Trump into retaliating, thus entangling himself in a foreign war.",
        "MANAGUA, NICARAGUA \u2014 On the rim of a volcano with a clear view of the U. S. Embassy, landscapers are applying the final touches to a mysterious new Russian compound. Behind the concrete walls and barbed wire, a visitor can see buildings, manicured lawns, antennas and devices. The Nicaraguan government says it\u2019s simply a tracking site of the Russian version of a GPS satellite system. But is it also an intelligence base intended to surveil the Americans? \u201cI have no idea,\u201d said a woman who works for the Nicaraguan telecom agency stationed at the site.",
        "When the Obama administration launched a sweeping policy to reduce harsh prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, rave reviews came from across the political spectrum. Civil rights groups and the Koch brothers praised Obama for his efforts, saying he was making the criminal justice system more humane. But there was one person who watched these developments with some horror. Steven H. Cook, a former street cop who became a federal prosecutor based in Knoxville, Tenn. saw nothing wrong with how the system worked \u2014 not the life sentences for drug charges, not the huge growth of the prison population.",
        "Anybody who works in Washington knows that think tanks play an important role in advising the government on policy. For most bureaucrats, anything past two weeks is long term. Because experts at think tanks have fewer deadlines, they specialize in the strategic thinking that many Cabinet agencies cannot do. Over the years, think tanks have had a hand in conceiving the Reagan administration\u2019s governing strategy, the expansion of NATO and the surge in Iraq. One organization in particular has dramatically increased its influence over the past decade.",
        "Senate Democrats have more than 40 votes to filibuster Neil Gorsuch\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court. In response, Republicans appear to have more than 50 votes to invoke the \u201cnuclear option\u201d \u2014 that is, to vote Thursday morning to lower the cloture threshold for Supreme Court nominations to a bare majority. Apocalyptic rhetoric abounds. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) referred to the likely filibuster as \u201ca new low,\u201d while Patrick J. Leahy ( .) suggested that lowering the cloture threshold risked \u201cforever damaging the United States Senate.",
        "A gray SUV idled across the street from the chemical plant. Gas storage tanks, four stories tall, towered over the neighborhood. It was a hot, dry Sunday in southeast Los Angeles. The plant\u2019s front gate was open. The driver tapped the throttle, then cut into the facility, past the \u201cno trespassing\u201d notices and the signs demanding that all trucks stop and check in with a guard. He pointed the car straight at three trailers loaded with compressed hydrogen.",
        "Just before his first official White House meeting with President Trump on Wednesday, King Abdullah II of Jordan spoke to The Washington Post\u2019s Lally Weymouth about the key role he expects to play with the president in reviving the stalled peace talks. He also talked about the need for the United States to engage with Russian President Vladi mir Putin and perhaps make some concessions to solve the crisis in Syria. Excerpts follow: Q. What would you like to come out of your meeting with President Trump? A.",
        "Last month, a rumor that more than 500 mostly black and Latino children from the District of Columbia had been abducted and sold into sex slavery went viral on social media. A new decision by D. C. police to alert the public whenever children were reported missing had backfired; most of the kids had been found safe within 24 hours, but those updates never spread as far as the initial reports.",
        "One hundred years ago, on April 6, 1917, Congress voted to declare war on imperial Germany. The First World War was the pivot of the 20th century: It took the lives of 17 million people and resulted in the collapse of three major empires (the German, the Ottoman and the ). In the aftermath, totalitarian regimes both right and left came to power, leading to a second, far bloodier global conflict.",
        "Annoyed that palace intrigue stories dominated the headlines late this week, President Trump ordered two of his top advisers, Jared Kushner and Stephen K. Bannon, to work out their differences, according to two senior White House officials. The two met Friday afternoon after Chinese President Xi Jinping left Trump\u2019s Club in Florida, in a nearly meeting arranged by White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. According to one of the officials, the meeting ended amicably, with both men agreeing to work together to advance Trump\u2019s agenda.",
        "Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley (R) has spent the past year unsuccessfully digging out of a growing heap of political trouble related to an alleged affair with a former top aide and allegations that he used public resources to carry it out and cover it up. Now, the governor is faced with the possibility that he could lose his job, go to jail \u2014 or both. On Saturday, more than a year after news of the affair broke wide open, the Alabama Supreme Court okayed impeachment proceedings in the state House against the governor.",
        "The Trump administration has failed to fill crucial public health positions across the government, leaving the nation to face one of its greatest potential threats: a pandemic outbreak of a deadly infectious disease, according to experts in health and national security. No one knows where or when the next outbreak will occur, but health security experts say it is inevitable. Every president since Ronald Reagan has faced threats from infectious diseases, and the number of outbreaks is on the rise.",
        "Budget negotiators struck a deal late Friday that could make New York the first state to cover residents\u2019 tuition at public universities. The $163 billion state budget agreement includes the Excelsior Scholarship, which covers tuition for any New Yorker accepted to one of the state\u2019s community colleges or universities, provided their family earns less than $125, 000 a year. Proposed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in January, the scholarship taps into one of the Democratic Party\u2019s most popular ideas and advances a bipartisan movement to lower the cost of college that is taking shape across the country.",
        "Congress limped into its spring break with little to demonstrate that much has changed from its previous dysfunctional gridlock \u2014 despite Republicans\u2019 control of both Capitol Hill and the White House. There were vows at the start of the year of a offense, but Republican leaders ended the first three months of 2017 with only one major accomplishment: the confirmation of Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Even that came with a high price \u2014 changing the Senate rules in such a way as to permanently decrease the influence of the minority.",
        "Seattle Mayor Ed Murray, a nationally famous champion of gay rights and progressive causes, has been accused by three men of having sex with them as children. An unnamed man filed a child sex abuse lawsuit against the mayor on Thursday, alleging Murray \u201crepeatedly criminally raped and molested\u201d him when he was a homeless in the 1980s. The unnamed plaintiff and two other men subsequently gave interviews to the Seattle Times \u2014 all telling similar stories about a politico in his late 20s and 30s, who befriended street kids, paid them and had his way with them.",
        "Gerrymandering is an easy punching bag, and it deserves its reputation. Every 10 years, Republicans and Democrats across the country draw the most favorable districts for their own political purposes, sometimes leaving contorted maps in their wakes. But gerrymandering is also blamed too much for too many things \u2014 especially for our political polarization and for Republicans\u2019 strong advantage in the House. Just last week, an in The Washington Post blamed gerrymandering for breeding the conservative Freedom Caucus, which thwarted the GOP bill. Some new data from the Cook Political Report shows how overwrought this is.",
        "The most dish at PYT, a restaurant from Los Angeles chef Josef Centeno, takes 15 minutes for the kitchen to execute and is introduced with the kind of ceremony typically reserved for Dover sole or chateaubriand. Centeno, or one of his staff, ferries the signature on a ceramic plate to the table, where the chef chips away an armor of kosher salt and egg white and frees the main event from the hoja santa leaf in which it\u2019s baked. Next, he quarters the centerpiece and embellishes it with a nettle chimichurri."
