        "The story goes that President Ronald Reagan was riding his horse in the vicinity of Camp David, noticed that all the wild dogwoods were dying and asked for an explanation. The response from government botanists was that the beloved dogwood, that living symbol of the American spring with its stellar white blossoms, was in dire straits. A fungal disease named dogwood anthracnose was sickening and ultimately killing the flowering dogwoods in Maryland\u2019s Catoctin Mountain Park. Soon it would spread far and wide, from native populations to dogwood varieties in gardens.",

It has the potential to lower costs and has been a component of the national dietary guidelines for over 10 years. So why are so few people using it? What is the DASH diet?

        "Officials in the Trump administration on Sunday demanded that Russia stop supporting the Syrian government or face a further deterioration in its relations with the United States. Signaling the focus of talks that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is set to have in Moscow this week, officials said that Russia, in propping up Syrian President Bashar bears at least partial responsibility for Wednesday\u2019s chemical attack on villagers in Idlib province.",
        "\u201cThis was a strike that was went right to the heart of the matter, which is using chemical weapons. \u201d \u2014 Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) April 7, 2017 \u201cI\u2019ve concluded that being credible on Syria requires presenting a credible response, and having a credible strategy. And for all the reasons I\u2019ve indicated, this proposal just doesn\u2019t pass muster. \u201d \u2014 McConnell, Sept. 10, 2013 \u201cThese tactical strikes make it clear that the [Bashar ] regime can no longer count on American inaction as it carries out atrocities against the Syrian people.",
        "Deputy national security adviser K. T. McFarland is expected to leave her National Security Council post and is expected to be named U. S. ambassador to Singapore, an administration official said. McFarland, who was named to her post by the previous national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was initially told that she could remain at the White House when Flynn was replaced by H. R. McMaster.

        "ATLANTA \u2014 Republicans are becoming increasingly concerned about their ability to hang on to former Republican congressman Tom Price\u2019s seat here in a wealthy, suburban district where restive Democratic energy has been surging since November\u2019s election. Democratic hopes rest on Jon Ossoff, a former congressional staffer and preternaturally candidate. He has raised a whopping $8. 3 million for the special election to replace Price in Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District \u2014 more than anyone has ever collected to win this seat, which has not been represented by a Democrat for nearly four decades.",
        "Stephen K. Bannon could barely finish his sentences as he implored the listeners of his Breitbart News radio show to see the new movie \u201cClinton Cash. \u201d It was July 20, the homestretch of the 2016 presidential campaign, and Bannon was describing Bill and Hillary Clinton as \u201cscumbags\u201d and \u201cbandits\u201d who had made millions of dollars through political connections. \u201cHillary and Bill Clinton are the two single biggest grifters ever to run for president of the United States,\u201d Bannon told his guest, Peter Schweizer, the author of the book behind the movie.",
        "TANTA, Egypt \u2014 Bombs rocked churches packed with worshipers in the Egyptian cities of Tanta and Alexandria on Sunday, killing at least 43 and injuring scores more. The assaults were the latest in a spate of attacks targeting Egypt\u2019s Coptic Christian minority and come ahead of a scheduled visit by Pope Francis to Egypt. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for both bombings through the Amaq News Agency, which is affiliated with the Islamist militant group. Egypt\u2019s Christian minority, who make roughly 10 percent of the population, have increasingly been targeted by Islamist extremists.",
        "I\u2019m not sure if neophilia is a real disease or a literary invention, but having a love for novelty certainly describes a large part of the American and indeed the international press corps. My neophiliac colleagues and I love news, particularly news that changes the paradigm, news that lets you describe the world in a different way, news that means you can abandon the previous, stale conversation and turn with relief to something fresh. President Trump\u2019s decision to bomb an air base in Syria seems like exactly that kind of news.",
        "When Secretary of State Rex Tillerson travels to Moscow this week, topic No. 1 will be Syria \u2014 and the stakes could not be higher. If the Trump administration and the Kremlin are not able to come to a meeting of the minds on Syria, it could set the two nuclear powers on a dangerous collision course. Early Friday morning in Syria, 59 U. S. Tomahawk missiles slammed into the Shayrat air base in retaliation for the unconscionable gassing of dozens of civilians by President Bashar \u2019s regime two days earlier.",
        "Supreme Court Justice Neil M. Gorsuch will return to the White House on Monday for a ceremony in the Rose Garden that President Trump and his allies hope will resonate well beyond the judge\u2019s ugly confirmation battle. The event marks a big win for Trump and conservatives \u2014 both on and off Capitol Hill \u2014 who have struggled desperately to produce significant victories despite pledges of sweeping change in Washington that rule would bring.",

        "If Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) has his way, the Badger State will become the first to stop requiring students in public schools to spend a minimum number of hours in class. A proposal in Walker\u2019s new budget plan calls for ending the state\u2019s current minimum requirements \u2014 437 hours for kindergarten, 1, 050 hours for elementary schools and 1, 137 hours for secondary schools \u2014 and allowing school districts to do what they want in terms of seat hours for students.",
        "Tysen Benz was in his room when he read text messages saying someone he knew had committed suicide. Shortly after, the boy from Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula hanged himself. Now, a girl is facing criminal charges in connection to his death. Marquette County Prosecuting Attorney Matt Wiese said the girl posed as someone else when she faked her own death during a text conversation with Tysen.

        "Last year, someone kept hacking into traffic signs in Dallas \u2014 corrupting bland electronic messages into jokey missives such as: \u201cWork is Canceled \u2014 Go Back Home\u201d and \u201cDonald Trump Is A Shapeshifting Lizard! !\u201d Funny? Dumb? Vandalism? Whatever your opinion of the pranks, the big Dallas hack of 2016 had one quality totally lacking in this year\u2019s sequel: It was silent. On Friday night, 18 minutes before midnight, every single one of Dallas\u2019s 156 emergency weather sirens started doing this: Ever wonder what the end of the world feels like? #dallas #sirens pic. twitter.",
        "The weather was relatively calm on Saturday afternoon when a South Carolina church was holding its annual spring carnival that usually features inflatables, games and food. But about an hour into the event, which was held outside the church, an unexpected wind gust \u2014 sort of like a \u2014 started swirling around, gathering leaves and dirt along the way. At one point, it appeared to have dissipated, but then it picked up speed and lifted an inflatable slide and a bounce house into the air, Ricky Reed, battalion chief for the Taylors Fire Department, told The Washington Post.",
        "Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley (R) resigned Monday after fighting for more than a year against allegations he used public resources to carry out and conceal an affair with his former top aide. Pressure built on Bentley to step down over the sex scandal as state lawmakers opened impeachment hearings against him this week and state Republican officials called for him to leave the governor\u2019s mansion.",
        "Americans narrowly support missile strikes ordered by President Trump last week in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack in Syria, even as most oppose additional military efforts to remove President Bashar from power, according to a new Washington News poll. By 51 to 40 percent, more support than oppose the missile strikes launched early Friday on the Shayrat air base in Syria, with opinions dividing sharply along partisan lines. Trump\u2019s action was widely praised by Republicans, as well as many Democrats, though there has been less agreement on what additional steps to take.",
        "\u201cWe were able to find a solution that didn\u2019t necessitate the use of force that actually removed the chemical weapons that were known from Syria, in a way that the use of force would never have accomplished. Our aim in contemplating the use of force following the use of chemical weapons in August of 2013 was not to intervene in the civil war, not to become involved in the combat between Assad and the opposition, but to deal with the threat of chemical weapons by virtue of the diplomacy that we did with Russia and with the Security Council.",
        "Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold remembers being struck by Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to donate $6 million, including $1 million of his personal funds, to veteran groups during a televised fundraiser before the Iowa caucuses early last year. Did Trump follow through? he wondered. So, weeks after the event, Fahrenthold started asking questions. For several months, he found, the answer was no, despite assurances to the contrary from Trump\u2019s campaign. When Trump finally made the donation in late May, the reporter set off on a broader inquiry.",
        "Three people, including a teacher and an boy, died Monday in an apparent at an elementary school in San Bernardino, Calif. police said, dealing another shock to a community still reeling from a terrorist attack two years ago that claimed the lives of 14 people.

Wells Fargo said Monday that two former senior executives, including its CEO John Stumpf, must return an additional $75 million in compensation after a scathing internal report found the bad sales practices that have rocked the mega bank date back far longer than initially acknowledged. Stumpf, who stepped down in October, had already agreed to give up $41 million in compensation as the scandal roiled the San Francisco bank. Now, Wells Fargo says it will \u201cclaw back\u201d an additional $28 million from Stumpf.",
        "The United States has become a combatant in Syria\u2019s horrific civil war. The Trump administration, which intervened with deadly military force, gives no sign of knowing what it\u2019s doing or why. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has absurdly tried to suggest that nothing has changed. He is wrong. cruise missiles constitute a policy shift. So what is the administration\u2019s strategic vision? What is its desired outcome? How does it get there? And what happens next? U. N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said Sunday that the administration cannot envision \u201ca peaceful Syria\u201d with dictator Bashar still in power.",
        "In a conversation with an ambassador from Asia a few years ago, I asked why her country was still more favorably disposed to the United States than to a rising China. \u201cBecause we know what you believe in,\u201d she responded. Since World War II, the United States has operated in the Pacific with a certain set of interests and values. Both, she said, are \u201cless clear\u201d with respect to China. It is predictability that builds and maintains alliances. It is constancy that enforces red lines, allowing others to accurately calculate the limits of American patience.",
        "Maybe we should muzzle the talk. MSNBC host Lawrence O\u2019Donnell led off his show Friday night with an alarming report: Russian President Vladimir Putin may have told Syria\u2019s Bashar to launch last week\u2019s chemical attackto let President Trump respond militarily \u2014 thereby boosting Trump\u2019s standing in the United States and dispelling the belief that he is too close to Putin. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said, telling viewers \u201cwhat you won\u2019t hear is proof that that scenario that I have just outlined is impossible, because . . . with Donald Trump anything is possible.",
        "Last week was bad for two nations. The first was Syria, which got 59 Tomahawk missiles slammed into it, destroying part of its air force, causing some casualties and losing the confidence that it could use nerve agents with impunity. The second was the United States, which launched those missiles and then, with some exceptions, roared its approval of what its president did. That will change soon enough. It was the right decision. It was just made by the wrong person.",
        "As a candidate, Donald Trump promised that the instincts and negotiating skills that landed him in the club would translate to managing the macroeconomy. He was uniquely to help the nation\u2019s other job creators reach their full potential, he told voters. Despite such declarations, Trump is proving to be, in at least some crucial respects, unexpectedly . As a businessman, he surely knows that one of the key things companies need to plan and make investments is a clear understanding of what the policy environment will look like going forward.",
        "PRETTY SOON, the Trump administration may trot out 100 or 200 new appointees to positions in the U. S. government that require Senate confirmation. We hope these appointees are at least well along in the pipeline. As it stands now, President Trump is falling behind the pace of his recent predecessors in filling jobs in vital areas such as public health, foreign policy and military affairs, among others. While every administration moves too slowly, a prolonged period of empty chairs could hamper crisis management and weaken U. S. policy over the long term.",
        "AUSTIN, Texas \u2014 A judge ruled for a second time Monday that Texas\u2019 strict voter ID law was intentionally crafted to discriminate against minorities, which follows another court finding evidence of racial gerrymandering in how Republican lawmakers drew the state\u2019s election maps. The latest ruling by U. S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos of Corpus Christi comes more than two years after she likened the rules in Texas, known as SB 14, to a \u201cpoll tax\u201d meant to suppress minority voters.",
        "Attorney General Jeff Sessions will end a Justice Department partnership with independent scientists to raise forensic science standards and has suspended an expanded review of FBI testimony across several techniques that have come under question, saying a new strategy will be set by an team of law enforcement advisers. In a statement Monday, Sessions said he would not renew the National Commission on Forensic Science, a roughly advisory panel of scientists, judges, crime lab leaders, prosecutors and defense lawyers chartered by the Obama administration in 2013."
