        "United Airlines says a man wouldn\u2019t give up his spot on an overbooked flight Sunday. So, according to witnesses and videos of the incident, he was pulled screaming from his seat by security, knocked against an arm rest and dragged down the aisle and back to the terminal at Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International Airport. United refused to answer questions about the incident, which horrified other passengers on the flight. An airline spokesman only apologized for the overbooked flight, and said police were called after a passenger \u201crefused to leave the aircraft voluntarily.",
        "Colorado appeals court judge Neil M. Gorsuch took his oaths to be the Supreme Court\u2019s 113th justice Monday morning, first in a private ceremony at the court and later at a Rose Garden ceremony with the man who nominated him, President Trump. At the first event, in a grand room inside the Supreme Court, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. administered the oath that all federal employees take. The other justices and most of their spouses were on hand, as well as Maureen Scalia and Eugene Scalia, the widow and son of the justice Gorsuch is replacing, Antonin Scalia.",
        "This story has been updated. Fox News Channel\u2019s parent company is investigating the network\u2019s host Bill O\u2019Reilly after a Los Angeles radio personality leveled sexual harassment accusations against him. Wendy Walsh, host of the \u201dDr. Wendy Walsh Show\u201d on Southern California airwaves, said O\u2019Reilly pulled a job opportunity from her in 2013 after she declined to visit his hotel room \u2014 a charge the conservative pundit has vehemently denied. 21st Century Fox said it was looking into Walsh\u2019s accusation.",
        "The Facebook event invitation left little doubt about the protesters\u2019 feelings toward speaker Heather Mac Donald. They accused her of \u201cneglecting the state sponsored genocide committed against black people\u201d and said she represented \u201cwhite supremacist and fascist ideologies. \u201d And just in case people didn\u2019t get the point, organizers devil horns onto her picture. The last words on the invite, which has since been deleted, offered instructions to Claremont McKenna College students and others: Show up wearing black and \u201cbring your comrades, because we\u2019re shutting this down. \u201d They were true to their word.",
        "In the 1940s, Americans found a new way to love salt. Not simply for sprinkling on food \u2014 we\u2019d acquired a taste for the mineral long before that \u2014 but for spreading on roads and sidewalks. Salt became a method to frozen pavement. During the past annual U. S. sales of road salt grew from 160, 000 tons to about 20 million tons, as a group of environmental scientists pointed out in a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the Natural Academy of the Sciences.",
        "PARIS \u2014 The Velodrome d\u2019Hiver is an eternal stain on French history. After dark on July 16, 1942, French police rounded up about 13, 000 Jews from across occupied Paris and deposited them in the \u201cVel d\u2019Hiv,\u201d a famous indoor stadium that had hosted the 1924 Summer Olympics and where the likes of Ernest Hemingway would come to enjoy the races. From the stadium, not far from the Eiffel Tower, the vast majority of these interned Jews in 1942 were deported to Auschwitz. Most would never return from that World War II Nazi concentration camp.",
        "A perfectly arranged line of laundry. (Sarah L. Washington Post) Cape Breton Island, at the eastern end of Nova Scotia, has a population of 130, 000. Its summers attract tourists and its winters are bitter, its eastern edge bare to the winds of the Atlantic Ocean. Washington Post reporter Chico Harlan recently wrote about a website callout to Americans looking to escape the presidency of Donald Trump. Move to Cape Breton, it said. That hasn\u2019t happened, and with strict immigration laws in Canada, it\u2019s not likely to happen any time soon.",
        "The FBI obtained a secret court order last summer to monitor the communications of an adviser to presidential candidate Donald Trump, part of an investigation into possible links between Russia and the campaign, law enforcement and other U. S. officials said. The FBI and the Justice Department obtained the warrant targeting Carter Page\u2019s communications after convincing a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power, in this case Russia, according to the officials.",
        "After two days of conflicting explanations, falling stock prices and worldwide outrage, United Airlines entered mea culpa mode Tuesday afternoon when its chief executive announced an internal investigation into an incident involving a man who was violently removed from a plane so a crew member could have his seat. \u201cI continue to be disturbed by what happened,\u201d United chief executive Oscar Munoz said in a statement. \u201cI deeply apologize to the customer forcibly removed and to all the customers aboard. No one should ever be mistreated this way.",
        "WICHITA \u2014 As James Thompson worked his way through a coffee shop, the Democratic candidate for Congress said something that got people to look up from their laptops. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lead right now. \u201d \u201cReally?\u201d said Marla Flentje, a Republican who said she\u2019d voted for him in early balloting. A trio of Democrats walked over to meet Thompson and tell him they\u2019d vote Tuesday. \u201cI hope you do, because right now, we\u2019re winning,\u201d said Thompson. Republican Ron Estes, left, Kansas state treasurer, and Democrat James Thompson, a civil rights lawyer, are competing to replace Rep.",
        "White House press secretary Sean Spicer apologized on Tuesday for remarks that were viewed as downplaying the atrocities of the Holocaust. In criticizing Syrian President Bashar \u2019s alleged use of chemical weapons during a Tuesday briefing, Spicer said that even Adolf Hitler did not sink to that level of warfare and \u201cwas not using the gas on his own people in the same way that Assad is doing,\u201d despite Hitler\u2019s use of gas chambers to kill millions of Jews and others. Following hours of controversy, Spicer walked back his remarks late in the day.",
        "The Trump administration took the unusual step Tuesday of unveiling intelligence discrediting Russia\u2019s attempts to shield its ally, Syrian President Bashar from blame in last week\u2019s deadly chemical attack. The newly released details of a U. S. intelligence assessment, which officials said demonstrated Syrian culpability in the April 4 assault that killed at least 70 people, added to rapidly escalating tensions with the Kremlin and signaled a move away from hopes for U. S. rapprochement with Russia.",
        "Back during his presidential campaign, Donald Trump summed up his approach to foreign policy this way: \u201cWe must as a nation be more unpredictable. \u201d But now that he is commander in chief, anxious allies say that unpredictability might be better described as incoherence \u2014 a dangerous tendency at a moment of high tension with Russia and Syria, and with U. S. warships heading toward the Korean Peninsula. In recent weeks, the new president has held meetings with his counterparts from other countries.",
        "Julian Assange is the editor of WikiLeaks. On his last night in office, President Dwight D. Eisenhower delivered a powerful farewell speech to the nation \u2014 words so important that he\u2019d spent a year and a half preparing them. \u201cIke\u201d famously warned the nation to \u201cguard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. \u201d Much of Eisenhower\u2019s speech could form part of the mission statement of WikiLeaks today.",
        "Daniel Hemel is an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School. State lawmakers across the country are pursuing creative methods to force President Trump to release his federal income tax returns before he can run for reelection in 2020. Unfortunately for citizens interested in greater presidential transparency, those efforts are likely to fail. There is, however, a much easier way for state lawmakers to force the disclosure of Trump\u2019s tax information: publishing the state tax returns already in their possession, which would reveal much of the same information appearing in his federal documents.",
        "Despite recent revelations that Fox News and anchor Bill O\u2019Reilly had settled five complaints of sexual harassment against him to the tune of millions \u2014 his ratings went up. A few days later, a United Airlines passenger was dragged from an airplane to make room for crew members on a full flight \u2014 and United\u2019s stock initially went up. And for this we pay good money? The shock wasn\u2019t so much that monetary values seem to increase in direct correlation to the diminution of moral values but that we\u2019ve become passive bystanders to appalling behavior and allegations.",
        "Before you seek to board a plane, please ask yourself the following questions. Better to ask them before something happens than after! You may not deserve to fly, it turns out. Are you completely without sin? Are you sure? Think back onto your past. Have you stolen, committed adultery or eaten of unclean meats? What is in your browser history? Have you ever lusted in your heart? Have you been rude to your mother? Have you smoked the Demon Weed, even a single time?",
        "The Trump administration\u2019s foreign policy has been a dizzying spectacle of mixed messages and policy reversals during its first three months. But in last week\u2019s crucial tests, President Trump made good decisions about Syria, Russia and China \u2014 moving his erratic administration a bit closer toward the pillars of traditional U. S. policy. The decision to strike a Syrian air base was a confidence builder for an inexperienced and sometimes fractious White House, a senior official said.",
        "THE PROSPECT that the Trump administration will soon develop friendly relations with Russia appears to be fading fast. Though President Trump has yet to make a critical remark in public about Vladi mir Putin, his aides are lambasting the Kremlin for its tolerance of, and possible complicity in, a attack by Syria. White House aides are even denouncing the \u201cfake news\u201d reports with which Moscow is attempting to sow confusion about the use of the nerve agent sarin by the regime of Bashar \u2014 which is certainly a change from Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign habit of echoing Russian disinformation.",
        "President Trump, who made opposition to free trade with China and other countries a centerpiece of his campaign and has continued with tough talk since entering office, is struggling to enact policies that match his trade rhetoric. Within days Trump will decide whether to follow through on his campaign pledge to declare China a \u201ccurrency manipulator,\u201d a designation that could lead to new U. S. tariffs if China doesn\u2019t change its practices.",
        "Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( . Y.) is warning that President Trump needs to release his personal tax returns if he hopes to achieve comprehensive tax reform in the coming months. \u201cIt\u2019s going to make tax reform much harder\u201d if Trump doesn\u2019t release his returns, Schumer told reporters Tuesday. Anytime the president proposes something on tax reform, \u201cthe average American is going to say, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s not doing that because it\u2019s good for me, he\u2019s doing it because it\u2019s good for him.\u2019 So for his own good, he ought to make them public.",
        "SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. \u2014 Cedric Anderson had been married to Karen Elaine Smith just two months when he walked into her classroom at a Southern California elementary school, fatally shot her, and then turned the gun on himself, police said.

        "A boy and his dog were walking last month on a hill near their home in Pocatello, Idaho, when they came across something in the ground that looked like a sprinkler head.

        "TOKYO \u2014 The United States and North Korea are engaging in brinkmanship, with North Korea warning Tuesday that it will \u201chit the U. S. first\u201d with nuclear weapons, but the prospects that this could escalate into an actual clash of arms are slim. The stakes remain too high for both countries, analysts say, today as they were yesterday, as they were last year. But the temperature in the region has become decidedly hotter in recent days. And there\u2019s always the chance that one side or the other could miscalculate.",
        "As Mitt Romney reportedly mulls a 2018 Senate bid, his infamous \u201cbinders full of women\u201d \u2014 actual, physical binders \u2014 have surfaced. They weigh a total of 15 pounds, 6 ounces, according to the Boston Globe, which obtained them from a former aide to the 2012 Republican presidential nominee. This might actually be a good thing for Romney. Yes, the emergence of a pair of binders, stuffed with women\u2019s resumes, is a reminder of a gaffe Romney committed during a debate five years ago.",
        "\u201cStop the Runaway,\u201d Andrew Jackson urged in an ad placed in the Tennessee Gazette in October 1804. The future president gave a detailed description: A \u201cMulatto Man Slave, about thirty years old, six feet and an inch high, stout made and active, talks sensible, stoops in his walk, and has a remarkable large foot, broad across the root of the toes \u2014 will pass for a free man \u2026 \u201d Jackson, who would become the country\u2019s seventh commander in chief in 1829, promised anyone who captured this \u201cMulatto Man Slave\u201d a reward of $50, plus \u201creasonable\u201d expenses paid.",

        "When Stephen K. Bannon reported for work Wednesday, he did not act like a man who had just been publicly humiliated by his boss. The White House chief strategist cycled in and out of the Oval Office for meetings with President Trump and took a seat in the front row of the East Room for the afternoon visit of NATO\u2019s secretary general, flanked by some of the very advisers with whom he has been feuding."
