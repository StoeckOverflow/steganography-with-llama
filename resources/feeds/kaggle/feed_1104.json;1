        "MOSCOW \u2014 The rift between the United States and Russia was laid bare Wednesday when Secretary of State Rex Tillerson held his first direct talks with Russia\u2019s president. Their discussions failed to ease deepening tensions over Syria and Washington\u2019s demands that Moscow abandon its main Middle East ally. \u201cThere is a low level of trust between our countries,\u201d Tillerson said in a news conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. \u201cThe world\u2019s two primary nuclear powers cannot have this kind of relationship. \u201d Wednesday\u2019s meeting brought no indication that the relationship would improve any time soon.",
        "President Trump on Wednesday pledged his full support to NATO, reaffirming the United States\u2019 commitment to the alliance and saying he no longer considers it \u201cobsolete,\u201d a sharp reversal from his rhetoric on the campaign trail and during his first weeks in office. On a day when Trump dramatically changed his stance on several policy positions, his statement about NATO stood out given his consistent criticism of the military alliance and its importance to U. S. allies.",
        "President Trump is abandoning a number of his key campaign promises on economic policy, adopting instead many of the centrist positions he railed against while campaigning as a populist. Trump will not label China a \u201ccurrency manipulator,\u201d he told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, despite a campaign pledge that he would apply the label on his first day in office. He also said he was open to reappointing Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet L. Yellen after saying last year that the central banker should be \u201cashamed\u201d of what she was doing to the country.",
        "The Trump administration is quickly identifying ways to assemble the nationwide deportation force that President Trump promised on the campaign trail as he railed against the dangers posed by illegal immigration. An internal Department of Homeland Security assessment obtained by The Washington Post shows the agency has already found 33, 000 more detention beds to house undocumented immigrants, opened discussions with dozens of local police forces that could be empowered with enforcement authority and identified where construction of Trump\u2019s border wall could begin.",
        "President Trump and a top adviser on Wednesday pushed back plans to overhaul the tax code, saying they wanted to prioritize first a renewed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The comments from Trump and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney mark a sharp reversal from the administration\u2019s approach just a few weeks ago.",
        "President Trump rose to power on a combination of meanness, incoherence and falsehoods. His strategy depended almost entirely on playing off the unpopularity and weaknesses of others. Every aspect of his approach has blown up on him since he took office, but as is always the case with Trump, he will not take any personal responsibility for what\u2019s going wrong. He must find a scapegoat. The latest object of his opprobrium would seem to be Stephen K. Bannon, the chief White House strategist.",
        "What Sean Spicer has done is inexcusable, and I cannot forgive him. I\u2019m not talking about the White House press secretary\u2019s claim Tuesday that Adolf Hitler didn\u2019t use poison gas, at least not against his \u201cown people,\u201d even if the Nazis did send Jews to \u201cHolocaust centers. \u201d He has apologized profusely for that. What\u2019s unforgivable is Spicer\u2019s brazen assault on spoken English. \u201cTell us who you want to apologize to,\u201d said CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, Spicer\u2019s of choice Tuesday evening. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to quantify this in any way,\u201d Spicer explained.",
        "With a mellifluous name suggesting bucolic tranquility, Rep. Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican, is an unlikely object of the caterwauling recently directed at him and the House Freedom Caucus he leads. The vituperation was occasioned by the HFC\u2019s role rescuing Republicans from embracing an unpopular first draft of legislation to replace Obamacare. A decisive blow against the bill was struck by the quintessential Republican moderate, New Jersey\u2019s Rodney Frelinghuysen, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, whose family has included a member of the Continental Congress, four U. S. senators and, in 1844, a nominee: \u201cHurrah! Hurrah!",
        "Clinton Ehrlich is a visiting researcher at Moscow State Institute of International Relations. As a law student, he spearheaded the exoneration of Sgt. Raymond Jennings. Eleven years ago \u2014 while on leave from Iraq \u2014 Sgt. Raymond Jennings was arrested at gunpoint and accused of murdering Michelle O\u2019Keefe. Jennings was convicted and appeared destined to die in prison, having been given a sentence. The California Supreme Court declined to review his conviction. Then something amazing happened: The district attorney\u2019s office in Los Angeles ordered Jennings to be released from prison last year after prosecutors expressed doubts about his guilt.",
        "Ray Boshara is the director of the St. Louis Fed\u2019s Center for Household Financial Stability and a senior fellow in the Aspen Institute\u2019s Financial Security Program. The views here are his own. Acclaimed TV shows such as \u201cAtlanta,\u201d \u201c \u201d and \u201cInsecure\u201d reveal a troubling paradox: Why do many black Americans feel so economically insecure? Here\u2019s a surprising clue: Blacks with college degrees have lost wealth over the past generation. Lots of wealth, in fact \u2014 and in sharp contrast to whites. Research from the Federal Reserve Bank of St.",
        "PRETTY MUCH everyone can agree that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents should be able to freely search travelers\u2019 bags at the border. Their job is to stop everything from illegal weapons to illicit drugs to invasive species from entering the country. But searching through every last email on your cellphone? That\u2019s much less defensible. Even so, CBP has the legal authority to thumb through every personal detail on Americans\u2019 electronic devices without meeting any standard of suspicion, as though practically bottomless digital storage devices were the same as suitcases.",
        "President Trump spoke with Fox Business Network\u2019s Maria Bartiromo in an interview airing Wednesday morning, and it was par for the course for Trump. By which I mean he rewrote history (on his views of attacking Syria) offered some cryptic comments (about FBI Director James Comey\u2019s job) and appeared to completely reverse course on strategy (saying he now wants to finish reform before tax reform). He even appeared to brag about striking Syria while eating dessert with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Below is the full transcript, with the key parts highlighted and analyzed.",
        "The Trump administration has proposed whacking the budget of the Environmental Protection Agency by nearly a third, eliminating thousands of employees and scrapping dozens of programs, including research and cleanup efforts in the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay. But a detailed budget plan obtained by The Washington Post last week includes a request to add positions within the agency\u2019s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance \u201cto provide security detail\u201d for EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt.",
        "Donald Trump said that when he became president, it would be easier to sue media companies \u201cand win lots of money. \u201d As if on cue, first lady Melania Trump recovered a reported $2. 9 million in a libel suit Wednesday, Day 82 of her husband\u2019s presidency. The victory came with a huge asterisk, however: The settlement was approved by a court in England, where libel protections for journalists are far weaker than in the United States.",
        "On Tuesday night, Democrat James Thompson did not win the first congressional election in the country since President Trump was elected. But he came within seven points in one of the most Republican districts in the nation.

        "Update: Burger King successfully ran an alternate version of its advertisement designed to trigger Google Home devices late Wednesday, the company said in an emailed statement Thursday. \u201dLast night, Burger King launched very similar commercials that 100% triggered the smart speaker technology. The commercials aired during Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon,\u201d said spokeswoman Dara Schopp. The company altered the ad\u2019s audio in such a way that it was able to get around whatever block the Google Home had against the original commercial.",
        "In less than a minute, a police stop over claims of jaywalking devolved into what many are calling a troubling example of excessive force: a white officer walloping a black man with more than a dozen punches on a Sacramento street. The officer involved has been suspended, Sacramento police said, and is the subject of an internal and a criminal investigation. On Monday, Nandi Cain Jr.",
        "Abraham Lincoln\u2019s name is frequently invoked as one the greatest \u2014 if not the greatest \u2014 leaders ever produced on American soil. Adolf Hitler\u2019s name is frequently invoked as one of the worst \u2014 if not the worst \u2014 human beings ever produced on Planet Earth, a man worthy of enough scorn that his name is a colloquial benchmark for what constitutes evil (i. e. \u201cThat guy sucks, but he\u2019s no Adolf Hitler\u201d).",
        "Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson was rescued by firefighters from a stuck elevator while touring an affordable housing development in Miami on Wednesday morning. The secretary was visiting the Courtside Family Apartments as part of a listening tour in the area to learn about the challenges people face finding affordable housing. The Miami Herald estimates Carson was trapped for about 20 minutes. Alonzo Mourning, the famed former Miami Heat player, was waiting for Carson when he was released.",
        "Wendi at Lyons Raceway, 2013. (Jeffrey Wolin) Jeffrey Wolin took the Indiana neighborhood of Pigeon Hill and turned it inside out for all to see. Transfixed by the characters in this impoverished neighborhood in the housing projects of Bloomington, Ind. he photographed them from 1987 to 1991. Their mullets and blowouts, incomparable. Many hold in their eyes the clarity and rawness of youth. Seven years ago, Wolin came across a story about a young woman who was murdered, and he recognized her as one his subjects.",
        "U. S. forces in Afghanistan dropped a bomb on Islamic State forces in eastern Afghanistan Thursday, the Pentagon announced, using the largest bomb ever used in combat. Gen. John W. Nicholson, the commander of U. S. forces in Afghanistan, said the bomb was \u201cthe right munition\u201d to use against the Islamic State because of the group\u2019s use of roadside bombs, bunkers and tunnels. The bomb, known as the is one of the largest airdropped munitions in the U. S. military\u2019s inventory and was almost used during the opening salvos of the Iraq War in 2003. By comparison, U. S.",

        "Donald Trump campaigned as an outsider who would upend years of Washington orthodoxy in matters of both war and peace \u2014 an approach that helped him assemble the unconventional coalition that ultimately won him the presidency. But in recent days, the president has done an and embraced many of the policy positions he once scorned as the trappings of a foolhardy establishment. Trump voiced support for NATO, which he called \u201cobsolete\u201d during the campaign. He walked back his pledge to label China a currency manipulator and endorsed the bank, which he previously opposed.",
        "BIG SUR, Calif. \u2014 The first thing you notice is the silence, punctured by birdcalls and the roar of water moving through canyons. You usually can\u2019t hear these sounds, drowned out as they are by the 2 million tourists who flock here annually just to drive Highway 1, the route that cuts through Big Sur on California\u2019s scenic Central Coast. But today the tourists are gone and Highway 1 is home instead to pickup basketball games, mothers pushing strollers, and skateboarders whizzing by at speeds approaching the 45 mph limit.",

        "So much for Donald Trump, the \u201cAmerica First\u201d populist champion of the forgotten working class. The president now sounds pretty much like a globalist, defending the \u201crigged\u201d system he denounced during the campaign. Then again, who knows how he\u2019ll sound next week? He hasn\u2019t even been in office for three full months, and Trump may already be the most erratic president we\u2019ve ever seen. We have no idea where he really stands because, well, neither does he. Remember when Russia was good and President Vladimir Putin was a potential partner in fighting the Islamic State?",
        "The world is agog at President Trump\u2019s foreign policy reversal. He runs on a platform of America First. He renounces the role of world policeman. He excoriates parasitic foreigners that (I paraphrase) suck dry our precious bodily fluids \u2014 and these are allies! On April 4, Trump declared: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the president of the world. I\u2019m the president of the United States. And from now on, it\u2019s going to be America First. \u201d A week earlier, both his secretary of state and U. N.",
        "For a reminder of how new administrations can quickly get into trouble in foreign policy, consider that Monday, April 17, marks the anniversary of the catastrophic Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy. Bad things can happen to good presidents, and vice versa. President Trump, after a mostly disastrous first two months, has had a good run these past two weeks in foreign policy. He acted decisively in Syria, gained China as a possible partner in dealing with North Korea, repaired relations with NATO and began addressing the serious tensions with Russia.",

Last week it was Manhattan Institute scholar Heather Mac Donald, who was invited to speak at Claremont McKenna College in California. Hundreds of protesters blocked the entrances to the building where she was scheduled to talk, chanting \u201cBlack lives matter,\u201d \u201c the police\u201d and \u201cShut it down. \u201d Student journalists who tried to document the protest were swarmed, pushed and verbally threatened."
