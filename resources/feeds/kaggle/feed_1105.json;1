        "WHEN A politician an editorial writer\u2019s instinct is to pounce. When the politician a times in a week, as President Trump has done, the instinct is almost irresistible. Nor is the pouncing a childish game of \u201cgotcha,\u201d as the politician\u2019s defenders in such circumstances often maintain. People who voted for Mr. Trump on the expectation that he was going to keep his promises \u2014 to rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement, say, or tear up the Iran nuclear deal on the first day of his presidency \u2014 have reason to feel aggrieved.",
        "An arm of Congress is launching an investigation into President Trump\u2019s transition operation, including its public spending, private fundraising and how it managed communications with foreign governments. In a letter dated April 5, the independent, nonpartisan Government Accountability Office (GAO) told Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( .) and Rep. Elijah E. Cummings ( .) that it would undertake the probe.",
        "HOOD RIVER, Ore. \u2014 Rep. Greg Walden is one of the Republican House leaders who crafted the measure to overhaul the system that dramatically imploded before lawmakers went home for a recess. But when faced with a large crowd of angry constituents in his district this week, the Oregon Republican seemed reluctant to claim the legislation as his own. Instead, Walden stressed the parts of President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act that he wants to keep.",
        "Even as the White House lifts a freeze on government hiring, it\u2019s telling most federal agencies not to resume filling jobs and instead to shrink their staffs. They have a stockpile of tools to get started right now. Federal leaders can decide on their own to offer buyouts and early retirement packages to their employees. They can even begin the long process of laying them off, citing agency \u201crestructuring\u201d as the reason. They can eliminate vacant positions altogether, or redraw their organization charts so that employees do the work done by ones.",
        "When North Korea launched its satellite into space last February, officials heralded the event as a birthday gift for dead leader Kim Jong Il. But the day also brought an unexpected prize for the country\u2019s adversaries: priceless intelligence in the form of rocket parts that fell into the Yellow Sea. Entire sections of booster rocket were snagged by South Korea\u2019s navy and then scrutinized by international weapons experts for clues about the state of North Korea\u2019s missile program. Along with motor parts and wiring, investigators discerned a pattern. Many key components were acquired from businesses based in China.",
        "Addressing the United Nations last fall, President Barack Obama took a moment to highlight for fellow world leaders what he called \u201cthe most important fact\u201d about the state of global affairs: Human existence on planet Earth is good \u2014 and getting better. War is down, he said, while life expectancy is up. Democracy is on the march, and science has beaten back infectious diseases. A girl in a remote village can download the \u201centirety of human knowledge\u201d on a smartphone.",
        "Florida restaurant inspectors found numerous violations in the kitchen at President Trump\u2019s private club, . Inspectors from the Florida Department of Business & Professional Regulation cited more than a dozen violations in reports from a Jan. 26 inspection at Trump\u2019s \u201cwinter White House\u201d in Palm Beach, the Miami Herald first reported.

        "The attorney representing the man who was dragged off a United Airlines flight Sunday said it\u2019s likely his client will sue the company. \u201cWill there be a lawsuit? Yeah, probably,\u201d Thomas Demetrio, one of the attorneys representing David Dao, said at a Thursday morning news conference in Chicago. Demetrio said \u201cunreasonable force and violence\u201d were used against his client. \u201cI would defy anyone to suggest there was not unreasonable force and violence used to help Dr. Dao disembark that plane,\u201d he said.",

Mark Thompson pleaded guilty to lying in a sexual misconduct case, admitting Thursday that he \u201ccrossed the line\u201d when he had sex with two students during his tenure as an instructor at the U. S. Naval Academy. Thompson was slated to stand trial this week on charges of making a false statement and of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.

        "Elizabeth Starrels sat in the examining chair of a Washington ear, nose and throat specialist in October 2012, weeping in frustration and pain. For the previous four months, Starrels, then 52, had been battling painful mouth sores that were getting worse. Eating had become a near impossibility, and Starrels, who was largely subsisting on smoothies, had lost 20 pounds. Her dentist and an oral surgeon told her she had thrush, a yeast infection caused by an overgrowth of fungi in the mouth that can result from antibiotics.",
        "TOKYO \u2014 China issued a stern warning Friday to both the United States and North Korea, urging them not to push their recriminations to a point of no return and allow war to break out on the Korean Peninsula. In comments carried by China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said \u201cstorm clouds\u201d were gathering, an apparent reference to North Korean preparations to conduct a new nuclear test and the United States\u2019 deployment of a naval strike force to the waters off the peninsula. In addition, the U. S.",
        "Amid the often jarring inconsistency of President Trump\u2019s foreign policy, one thing has always been crystal clear: He loves a big show of American military force. \u201cYou gotta knock the hell out of them \u2014 Boom! Boom! Boom!\u201d Trump said of Islamic State terrorists at a January 2016 rally in Iowa, punctuating each \u201cboom\u201d with a punch of his fist. That same impulse has been apparent over the past 10 days as Trump pummeled a Syrian air base with cruise missiles, threatened military action against North Korea over its nuclear weapons program and praised the U. S.",
        "EL CAJON, Calif. \u2014 Rhonda Fattohi gathered the children on the rug at the front of the classroom, a cluster of eager faces awaiting her next cue.

Starting with \u2018Where I\u2019m from,\u2019 \u201d Fattohi asked, and tiny hands shot up. \u201cWhere I\u2019m from, we play soccer,\u201d one boy said. \u201cWhere I\u2019m from, I like to eat biryani,\u201d another said.",
        "The question of the moment is what to make of the normalization of President Trump. Not normalization in the way used by the Trump resistance \u2014 to argue against becoming inured to unacceptable behavior. But normalization of Trump in the usual sense of the term: that Trump is, if not behaving normally, at least adopting normal positions. NATO is \u201cno longer obsolete. \u201d China was a currency manipulator and would be branded as such in the Trump administration; now, never mind.",

This week\u2019s : \u201cCharging Bull\u201d vs. \u201cFearless Girl. \u201d Read on its surface, the visual metaphor makes it easy to take sides. A gargantuan work described as a \u201ctalisman for Wall Street traders\u201d vs. a feminist heroine? No contest. But underneath the bronze, the story is a bit more complex. The bull\u2019s demands are easy to demonize, but the girl isn\u2019t exactly a perfect foil.",
        "\u201cWhy should U. S. taxpayers be interested in Ukraine?\u201d That was the question that Rex Tillerson, the U. S. secretary of state, was heard to ask at a meeting of the Group of Seven foreign ministers, America\u2019s closest allies, a day before his visit to Moscow this week. We don\u2019t know what he meant by that question, or in what context it was asked. When queried, the State Department replied that it was a \u201crhetorical device,\u201d seeking neither to defend nor retract it.",
        "Chris Sagers teaches antitrust law and other topics at Cleveland State University. He testified before the House of Representatives against the merger of American Airlines and U. S. Airways in 2013. Video of airport security officers roughing up a passenger on a United Airlines flight may have been the news of the week, in terms of commentary and outrage. But in the larger scheme, it will likely not matter much, thanks to the oligopolistic structure of the airline industry. And to some extent, we have only ourselves to blame.",

        "WHEN A in France\u2019s impending presidential election obliterates history by denying the country\u2019s documented complicity in deporting tens of thousands of French and foreign Jews to Nazi death camps, it is clear something sinister is afoot in the birthplace of the Enlightenment. Characterizing France as a victim rather than a willing and even enthusiastic participant in World War II\u2019s mass liquidation of French and foreign Jews, Marine Le Pen, head of France\u2019s National Front, tried to remove the indelible stain left by that shameful chapter in her country\u2019s history.",
        "Some influential Republicans in Congress don\u2019t want a fight President Trump is threatening to pick over extra Obamacare payments to insurers. Trump suggested this week that as Congress seeks to fund the government beyond April, Republicans should refuse to pay for subsidies provided through the Affordable Care Act to Americans. There\u2019s widespread agreement that without the subsidies, insurers would be forced to hike premiums next year, worsening conditions in the Obamacare insurance marketplaces.",
        "The Trump administration announced Friday that it will not follow former president Barack Obama\u2019s policy of voluntarily disclosing the names of most visitors to the White House complex, citing \u201cgrave national security risks and privacy concerns. \u201d The announcement \u2014 from an administration that has faced pointed questions about its commitment to transparency \u2014 marks a significant shift from the Obama White House, which released the names of nearly 6 million visitors, including scores of lobbyists.",
        "KABUL \u2014 U. S. forces in Afghanistan have not yet assessed the impact of a massive strike on Islamic State militants in the eastern part of the country, a military spokesman said Friday, raising questions about the already controversial decision to deploy a bomb on the battlefield.

        "Choate Rosemary Hall is known for being one of the most prestigious boarding schools in the country, an institution with alumni like President John F. Kennedy, presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson and playwright Edward Albee. The elite Connecticut private school is also a place that has for decades fostered a pattern of sexual abuse and misconduct between teachers and students, according to a troubling new internal investigation initiated by the school to address abuse allegations. The report, which was released Thursday, was produced by Nancy Kestenbaum of Covington & Burling LLP, a former federal prosecutor, who was retained by Choate.",
        "President Trump won his election as a truth teller from outside the political establishment. Now, less than three months after taking office, he is reversing himself on some major questions about the American economy. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published Wednesday, Trump said he wanted to reopen the Export Import Bank \u2014 an obscure agency despised by his party\u2019s conservative faction \u2014 and that he would not formally accuse China of manipulating its currency, reversing positions he held during the campaign.",
        "Agents of the U. S. government are entitled to immunity from lawsuits for what they do in the line of duty, as long as they do it right, in accord with the Constitution. But what one NASA investigator did to Joann Davis, a financially distressed widow of an engineer on the Apollo program who was trying to raise a little money, was too much for a federal court of appeals to stomach. And on Thursday, the judges let her suit against him go forward. Here\u2019s what happened, as described in an opinion issued by a panel of the U.",

        "TOKYO \u2014 With the kind of fanfare that only a totalitarian state can muster, North Korea Saturday flaunted missiles that can theoretically reach the United States and defiantly stated that it was prepared to counter any U. S. attack with \u201ca nuclear war of our own. \u201d But it soon looked like a case of style over substance. North Korea somewhat ruined the impression created with the parade, which took place on the most important day of the year for Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime, with a failed missile launch Sunday morning."
