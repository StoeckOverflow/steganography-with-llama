        "TOKYO \u2014 North Korea put on a military display Saturday, when the regime celebrated its most important day of the year: \u201dthe Day of the Sun,\u201d the anniversary of its founder, Kim Il Sung. Kim Jong Un, the founder\u2019s grandson and the current leader of North Korea, has made it very clear that he wants nuclear warheads and the means to deliver them to the United States. In his New Year\u2019s Day address, Kim said that North Korea was entering the \u201cfinal stage\u201d of preparations to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the American mainland.",
        "North Korea remains a secluded place filled with contradictions. While the capital of Pyongyang is flourishing with new apartments, amusement parks and swimming pools, regular people on the outskirts continue to suffer from starvation and hunger. Kim Jong Un continues to reign over a nuclear weapons program that is growing, defying expectations from those who said it wasn\u2019t feasible for a North Korean rocket to reach the United States. Now we know it\u2019s a possibility.",
        "Some wore shirts with an image of President Trump as the Monopoly mascot hauling a bag of money. Others taunted the president with signs that said they would show him their taxes, if he showed them his. And in front of a few thousand people on the lawn of the U. S. Capitol there was an oversized inflatable chicken with hair resembling Trump\u2019s, suggesting the president is \u201ctoo chicken\u201d to release his taxes to the public.",
        "BEIRUT \u2014 A car bomb in northern Syria killed more than 100 people Saturday when it ripped through buses evacuating residents from a town besieged by rebels for more than two years. Syrian state television showed bodies strewn across the ground, the charred vehicles still packed with their passengers\u2019 possessions. By late afternoon, the road was lined with body bags. The attack served as a bloody reminder of the human stakes for regional powers as they broker a complex population swap, moving some 30, 000 Syrians between and territory.",
        "The nation\u2019s capital is one of the few places in the country that guarantees homeless families a right to shelter. So when Chanda Davis faced eviction last winter from the apartment in Southeast Washington she shared with her four children, she thought she could count on D. C.\u2019s Department of Human Services for help. Davis got help she wasn\u2019t expecting. Instead of putting a roof over her family\u2019s head, the city put bus tickets in their hands \u2014 and sent them on a trip to North Carolina.",
        "Last year, protesters from a campaign rally sued Donald Trump \u2014 claiming the future president urged his supporters to assault them. Now Trump is the president, of course. And while the lawsuit grinds on, with more accusations added last week, he claims he won immunity along with the election. \u201cMr. Trump is immune from suit because he is President of the United States,\u201d his lawyers wrote Friday, rebutting a complaint filed by three protesters who claimed Trump incited a riot against them at a Louisville event in March 2016.",
        "A couple of weeks after the 2008 election, Rahm Emanuel, the incoming White House chief of staff, and Phil Schiliro, the incoming White House director of legislative affairs, huddled with the Democratic congressional leadership to talk strategy. Everyone knows the big agenda they pursued \u2014 an $800 billion economic stimulus, a sweeping law and an overhaul of Wall Street regulations \u2014 but the leaders also agreed on a parallel strategy that was almost as critical.",
        "More Americans disapprove than approve of President Trump\u2019s job performance. His White House is in a perpetual state of turmoil. Fellow Republicans control Congress, but no signature legislation has passed. And in Kansas last week, the Republican candidate in a special election got a scare from a turbocharged Democratic base, winning a House seat by a far slimmer margin than expected. For a Republican Party already starting to strategize ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections, the turbulent, inchoate environment as the Trump presidency nears its mark could be a cause for concern or even alarm.",
        "On the \ufb01fth day the scientists who studied the rivers were forbidden to speak or to study the rivers. The scientists who studied the air were told not to speak of the air, and the ones who worked for the farmers were silenced, and the ones who worked for the bees. Someone, from deep in the Badlands, began posting facts. The facts were told not to speak and were taken away. The facts, surprised to be taken, were silent.",
        "FOR DECADES, and particularly since President Richard Nixon\u2019s administration, public pressure has led presidents to become steadily more open with citizens about how they conduct business, and more mindful of ethics. Major party candidates have released their tax returns, revealing information about their finances and any potential conflicts of interest. Presidential relatives have avoided high office. The Justice Department has insulated itself from the Oval Office.",
        "THE CASE FOR IMPEACHMENT by Allan J. Lichtman. Dey St. Books. 290 pp. $24. 99 Too soon? Any discussion of presidential impeachment that arrives before journalists have even embarked on their ritualistic \u201cfirst hundred days\u201d coverage could rightly be deemed premature, and to publish an entire book arguing the case, the height of partisanship. Yet, given our new president\u2019s disdain for constitutional checks and balances, the investigations already underway, and the turmoil knifing through this White House, it doesn\u2019t seem entirely unrealistic, either. This is a young administration that at times feels not just exhausting but exhausted.",
        "BEIRUT \u2014 In the summer of 1925, rebels from the Syrian countryside mounted a guerrilla uprising against French colonial rule. The French retaliated by looting, burning and carrying out massacres in villages they suspected of supporting the rebels. That October, French authorities executed about 100 villagers outside Damascus. They displayed 16 of the mutilated corpses in the capital\u2019s main public square; La Syrie, the government newspaper, called the row of bodies \u201ca splendid hunting score. \u201d The French had no military reason to do this.",
        "For the past few years, I\u2019ve sat in New Orleans high school classrooms watching students debate the fairest way for government to raise revenue. They \u2014 first as management consultants advising legislators; then as lawmakers, weighing what to tax: property vs. sales vs. income. Are there limits on what or who can be taxed? Is a flat tax or a progressive rate structure fairer? Sometimes their discussions are heated. These teenagers, however, have an edge that many adults don\u2019t: basic tax literacy.",
        "Christians worldwide are commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus in Good Friday worship services, followed by celebration of his resurrection on Easter Sunday. But as often as the cross appears in Christian artwork and Western culture at large, misunderstandings and myths persist as to its history, origins and image. Here are five of the most stubborn misconceptions about Christianity\u2019s most prominent symbol. Myth No. 1 Jesus\u2019 cross was a stake bisected by a horizontal beam.",
        "Dueling and rallies in Berkeley, Calif. turned violent Saturday as numerous fistfights broke out and protesters fired pepper spray into a crowd. Police arrested more than a dozen people and requested aid from other law enforcement agencies. It was not immediately clear what protesters were charged with, or whether there would be more arrests. The Berkeley Police Department seized numerous prohibited items, including sticks and knives, according to the agency.",
        "Democrats in Congress are accusing the Trump administration of ordering officials in federal departments and agencies to withhold information they need to carry out their duties, such as preparing for committee hearings. Party leaders say officials have routinely provided documents and detailed explanations of programs in the past, but now at least two ranking Democrats on congressional committees say their staff members were told directly by workers in agencies that they could no longer speak with them. The issue started in January and grew into such a concern that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( .) asked Rep.",
        "A Wisconsin congressman\u00c2 told a town hall attendee who was concerned about the elimination of online privacy protections that using the Internet is a choice \u201d a statement that\u00c2 has since drawn criticism on social media. During\u00c2 the\u00c2 meeting\u00c2 in Wisconsin on Thursday, the attendee asked\u00c2 about the recent decision by Congress\u00c2 to wipe away\u00c2 an policy that sought to limit what Internet service providers, such as Verizon, AT&T and Comcast, can do with customers Internet browsing history.",
        "BILLINGS, Mont. \u2014 Rob Quist, the Democratic candidate for Montana\u2019s sole U. S. House seat, had a problem. Big Sky Rising, the local progressive group \u2014 one of many that grew out of the National Women\u2019s March \u2014 had filled a room for his speech. But the room didn\u2019t have a sound system for Quist, a folk musician, to strum and sing his campaign theme song. \u201cLet me just recite a poem for you about how I feel about our public lands,\u201d said Quist. \u201cHer gown is luscious green when she attends the annual springtime ball.",
        "ROME \u2014 Emma Morano, at 117 the world\u2019s oldest person who is also believed to have been the last surviving person born in the 1800s, died Saturday at her home in northern Italy, her physician said. Dr. Carlo Bava told The Associated Press by phone that Morano\u2019s caretaker had called him to say she had stopped breathing in the afternoon while sitting in an armchair at her home in Verbania, a town on Italy\u2019s Lake Maggiore.",
        "Melania Trump\u2019s first act as first lady suggested she might play the rebel. When she announced that she would not move to the White House right away \u2014 and instead remained in her New York penthouse with her young son while her husband began rolling out controversial executive orders in Washington \u2014 she flouted the most basic of all first lady traditions. Now, after weeks of shirking the spotlight, Trump has begun to emerge from her cocoon, taking tentative steps to establish herself in her new role.",
        "An approximately tall infant giraffe fell into the world Saturday in a shower of amniotic fluid and catharsis, as more than 1 million people watched the end of a long and virally popular pregnancy. \u201cIt\u2019s a boy! !!\u201d Animal Adventure Park announced, as April the giraffe\u2019s newborn son wobbled around after her in an upstate New York pen.

        "Presenting this week\u2019s courtesy of the New York Post: \u201cWhy I won\u2019t date hot women anymore. \u201d The story begins by a courageous man with a \u201cmuscular build and a head full of hair\u201d explaining why he\u2019s sworn off the ladies he used to court in favor of a brunette who, while beautiful, is a lowly 5 feet, 2 inches and therefore cannot walk the runway. \u201cBeautiful women who get a fair amount of attention get full of themselves,\u201d he told the Post. \u201cEventually, I was dreading getting dinner with them because they couldn\u2019t carry a conversation.",
        "Most likely, you are one of the millions who have watched the video: A United Airlines passenger is sitting in his seat on a flight from Chicago O\u2019Hare to Louisville when along come three Chicago airport police. One of the officers drags the man down the aisle as if he were a slab of beef. An uproar ensues over his forced removal and continues days after the Sunday event. United\u2019s stock drops by 4 percent. On Twitter, travelers threaten to boycott the carrier. A lawsuit is a .",
        "Anyone who\u2019s taken a transatlantic flight in coach recently knows about the indignities of shrinking personal space. I can just about deal with being cramped for seven or eight hours at the beginning of vacation. But now that same level of seating is spreading to neighborhood bars, and a line must be drawn. I stopped in at the Hank\u2019s Oyster Bar happy hour recently for a cocktail and a few oysters, and found myself having to become very good friends with the couples on either side of me, whether I wanted to or not.",
        "Just days after taking office, President Trump invited American manufacturers to recommend ways the government could cut regulations and make it easier for companies to get their projects approved. Industry leaders responded with scores of suggestions that paint the clearest picture yet of the dramatic steps that Trump officials are likely to take in overhauling federal policies, especially those designed to advance environmental protection and safeguard worker rights. Those clues are embedded in the 168 comments submitted to the government after Trump signed a presidential memorandum Jan.",
        "ISTANBUL \u2014 President Recep Tayyip Erdogan claimed victory on Sunday in a referendum that would grant him vast new powers as the country\u2019s unrivaled head of state, strengthening his influence over the judiciary and his authority over the parliament and extending his divisive tenure in office. Unofficial vote tallies published by the state news agency showed that 51 percent of voters approved a set of constitutional changes that would transform Turkey\u2019s system of government from a parliamentary to a presidential system.",
        "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 Just hours before North Korea fired a failed ballistic missile, President Trump spent his morning enjoying the blue, breezy weather here on Florida\u2019s eastern coast Saturday, zipping around the greens of his private golf club.

        "KIRON, Iowa \u2014 Russell Paulson had already heard by the time he arrived at the Quik Mart for his afternoon coffee. Walt Miller had died. \u201cDied last night, huh?\u201d someone was saying as Russell pulled up a chair. \u201cYeah, last night,\u201d another man said. Russell listened; he had known Walt.

        "PALATKA, Fla. \u2014 Inside a government building here, Rep. Ted Yoho ( .) scolded his party\u2019s leaders for rolling out an \u201c \u201d bill and blamed House Speaker Paul D.

Mike Coffman ( .) held the House Freedom Caucus \u2014 to which Yoho belongs \u2014 culpable for the legislation\u2019s defeat.
