        "LILLE, FRANCE \u2014 A specter is haunting Europe \u2014 the specter of M\u00e9lenchon. In the latest plot twist in France\u2019s highly contentious presidential election, M\u00e9lenchon \u2014 an outspoken leftist who often appears on the campaign trail via hologram and who has pitched his proposal to nationalize France\u2019s biggest banks and renegotiate its relationship with the European Union via free Internet games and YouTube videos \u2014 is now soaring in the polls. With less than two weeks before the election, his meteoric and unexpected rise is already sending jitters through financial markets and shock waves through an increasingly anxious electorate.",
        "President Trump lashed out Sunday at the protesters who took part in marches across the country Saturday to demand that he release his tax returns, declaring on Twitter that \u201cThe election is over!\u201d Trump\u2019s comments followed a nationwide Tax March that drew thousands of people in dozens of cities on the country\u2019s traditionally recognized deadline to file taxes, April 15. As a candidate, Trump declined to voluntarily release his tax returns \u2014 a practice followed by other presidential hopefuls since the 1970s \u2014 claiming he couldn\u2019t do so because he was under audit.",
        "The latest Sean Spicer parody on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d was an epic satire that referenced events from the 2016 campaign all the way back to the Book of Exodus \u2014 though it mostly focused on Tuesday\u2019s train wreck of a White House news conference. Anyway, we thought a guide to the sketch might be handy, so here you go. 0:12 Spicer removes his bunny mask and hurls it off the screen: \u201cHey, kids. Happy Easter! Get out of here. \u201d True fact: Spicer once dressed up as the White House Easter Bunny for real.",
        "In only 15 years, American newspaper companies slashed their workforces by more than half \u2014 from 412, 000 employees in 2001 to 174, 000 last year. But that troubling trend wasn\u2019t on the minds of journalists at the Charleston last year as they dug deep into the epidemic that was inflicting mortal wounds on their community. No, what motivated them was the West Virginia paper\u2019s unofficial motto: \u201cSustained outrage.",
        "In 2006, you\u2019d be ridiculed for calling the \u201cFast and the Furious\u201d movies the defining American film franchise. That was the year the third installment, \u201cTokyo Drift,\u201d became a punching bag for critics and a dud. But in true fashion, the gang kept going. This weekend, the eighth movie, \u201cThe Fate of the Furious,\u201d beat out \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d to become the reigning global champ, opening to an estimated $532. 5 million worldwide. We\u2019ve come a long way since 2001 when the first movie came out, aimed at gear heads who love a good nitrous boost.",
        "Authorities have arrested a man suspected of killing Vanessa Marcotte, a Google employee who went out for a jog one afternoon and never came back. Angelo 31, has been charged with aggravated assault and battery and assault with attempt to rape, Worcester County District Attorney Joseph D. Early Jr. announced Saturday. Early told reporters during a news conference that a murder charge is expected to be filed. \u201cWe got him,\u201d Early told reporters, according to the Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re very comfortable that we\u2019ve got Vanessa Marcotte\u2019s killer.",
        "In his drive to dismantle President Barack Obama\u2019s regulatory legacy, President Trump has signed executive orders with great fanfare and breathed life into a law to nullify numerous regulations. But his administration is also using a third tactic: Going to court to stop federal judges from ruling on a broad array of regulations that are being challenged by Trump\u2019s own conservative allies. These cases were filed long before the election.",
        "SEOUL \u2014 For decades, South Koreans have lived in a technical state of war with a hostile brother country that considers them traitors and imperialist lackeys. Throughout verbal attacks and periodic military ones, this nation of 50 million people has brushed off tensions, much as one might ignore a combative uncle at Thanksgiving. It\u2019s similar this time around, as North Korea launches missiles and fires off increasingly incendiary threats, and as the United States responds with stark warnings and the strategic placement of an aircraft carrier.",
        "TOKYO \u2014 Vice President Pence warned North Korea on Monday not to test U. S. military might by pursuing its nuclear weapons program, citing recent strikes in Syria and Afghanistan as proof of American \u201cstrength and resolve. \u201d The stark warning, delivered in Seoul after the vice president went to the military demarcation line that separates the two Koreas, could revive speculation that the White House is considering military action against the regime in Pyongyang.",
        "White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Monday defended President Trump\u2019s decision to keep visitor logs to the White House complex under wraps, saying his predecessor\u2019s policy amounted to \u201cfaux\u201d government transparency. The Trump administration drew criticism from an array of watchdog groups when it announced Friday that it would end the Obama administration\u2019s policy of making most visitor logs available on a Web page about 90 to 120 days after visits occurred.",
        "All at once, Bill O\u2019Reilly is fighting for his TV life. The future of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s long career at Fox News may hinge on a accusation raised by a woman named Wendy Walsh, who has alleged that O\u2019Reilly propositioned her in a Los Angeles hotel in 2013, then retaliated against her when she rebuffed him. Walsh, a Los Angeles radio personality and author who offers relationship advice, hasn\u2019t sued or sought compensation \u2014 just validation that she and other women were wronged by the host of \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor.",
        "The two sisters and their kids rolled into Washington on Monday from southwestern Virginia, eager to take part in a uniquely American tradition: the White House Easter Egg Roll. One sister voted for Trump; the other for Hillary Clinton. But it didn\u2019t really matter to them who occupies 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. right now. This isn\u2019t about politics right here,\u201d explained Stacy Moland, 47, the Trump voter. \u201cWe just want to see the White House. \u201d And that was it in a nutshell \u2014 or maybe an eggshell \u2014 on Easter Monday.",
        "Last year, Mark Meckler, one of the founders of the tea party movement, had concerns about Donald Trump but gave the Republican nominee the benefit of the doubt, because Trump \u201cat least says he\u2019s going to attack\u201d the system. Now the conservative activist has revised his opinion. Trump \u201csaid he was going to D. C. to drain the swamp,\u201d Meckler said in a recent Fox Business interview, but \u201cnow it looks like we\u2019ve got the Creature from the Black Lagoon in the White House.",
        "The evidence of the Trump administration\u2019s flouting of basic norms of transparency and government ethics continues to mount. A new batch of examples \u2014 which we\u2019ll detail below \u2014 have just come to light in various news accounts. And as the scale and scope of the Trump transgressions comes into clearer view, another danger has presented itself: the sheer volume of them may be growing so overwhelming that tracking them could become nearly impossible. Once again, the president is glibly refusing to comply with the most fundamental practices of governmental ethics and transparency.",

        "SEOUL \u2014 The Trump administration is planning to drastically ramp up pressure on North Korea, and it needs cooperation from America\u2019s partners in the region for the strategy to work. But deep uncertainty about the future of South Korea\u2019s government could undermine Donald Trump\u2019s plan to tighten the noose around the Kim Jong Un regime. Vice President Pence toured the demilitarized zone Monday and looked across the border to North Korea.",
        "Tomorrow\u2019s special election in Georgia\u2019s 6th District is important. The losers will want to play down the significance of what occurs, and the winners will want to overreach. The fact is, both parties are heavily invested in this race, and the outcome will matter. If Democrats win, their victory will speak to and embolden the intensity of their radical, supporters. And if Republicans pull through, it will confirm that the GOP was organized and able to maintain control over traditionally red districts in the age of the \u201cresistance.",
        "Tuesday\u2019s contest in Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District to fill the seat of and Human Services Secretary Tom Price has gotten the president\u2019s attention. He tweeted, \u201cThe super Liberal Democrat in the Georgia Congressioal [sic] race tomorrow wants to protect criminals, allow illegal immigration and raise taxes!\u201d However unintentionally, this line of crude attack may well remind many upscale Republican and Democratic voters in this district why they dislike President Trump. He barely carried the district, running almost 20 points behind Price in November.",
        "Before hosting the annual Easter Egg Roll on the South Lawn of the White House on Monday, President Trump had another traditional Easter event to attend: the annual Easter egg hunt at his resort in Palm Beach, Fla.

        "Education funding in New Mexico is in trouble. New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez has vetoed higher education funding. All of it \u2014 and the legislature cannot override her veto. And funding is so tight for education that Albuquerque has decided to eliminate sports programs in every middle school \u2014 at least for now \u2014 a move the governor quickly criticized. The Republican governor\u2019s veto came on a $6. 1 billion spending bill for the next fiscal year, an action she took to protest legislative tax increases and spending.",
        "MOSCOW \u2014 The Soviets built Margarita Smurova\u2019s apartment building \u2014 and tens of thousands more like it \u2014 with an expiration date that\u2019s long since passed. She thinks the building is still in fine shape and could last a few more years, but Moscow has different plans.

        "ISTANBUL \u2014 President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday vigorously defended his narrow victory in a referendum granting him greater authority, dismissing criticism of the result by Turkish opposition parties, European election observers and protesters while making clear his government was moving on. \u201cDebate about this issue is now over,\u201d he said in an occasionally combative speech at his sprawling presidential palace that mentioned the 25 million voters who had supported the measure. \u201cWe are not going to stop,\u201d he said, according to an English translation of his comments on a state news channel.",
        "For hundreds of years, biologists knew of the giant shipworm only from shell fragments and a handful of dead specimens. Those specimens, despite being preserved in museum jars, had gone to mush. Still, the shipworm\u2019s scattered remains made an outsize impression on biologists. Its tubular shells \u2014 the shipworm isn\u2019t technically a worm but a bivalve \u2014 were so striking that Swedish taxonomist Carl Linnaeus included the animal in his book that introduced the scientific naming system \u201cSystema Naturae. \u201d And yet no one could get their hands on a living example of the giant shipworm, or Kuphus polythalamia.",
        "The message was defiantly optimistic, like a suitor determined to hold a relationship together despite mounting obstacles. \u201cThings will work out fine between the U. S. A. and Russia,\u201d President Trump declared on his Twitter account last week. \u201cAt the right time everyone will come to their senses & there will be lasting peace!\u201d Trump\u2019s interest in achieving warm relations with Moscow has been a consistent theme since the earliest days of his campaign, and it stands now as one of the few major foreign policy positions that he has not discarded or revised since taking office.",
        "BEIJING \u2014 As tensions mounted on the Korean Peninsula, Adm. Harry Harris made a dramatic announcement: An aircraft carrier had been ordered to sail north from Singapore on April 8 toward the Western Pacific. A spokesman for the U. S. Pacific Command, which Harris heads, linked the deployment directly to the \u201cnumber one threat in the region,\u201d North Korea, and its \u201creckless, irresponsible and destabilizing program of missile tests and pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability. \u201d Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters on April 11 that the Carl Vinson was \u201con her way up there.",
