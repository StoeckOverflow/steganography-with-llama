        "If Johnny DeStefano applied for a job in the Trump administration, chances are pretty good that Johnny DeStefano wouldn\u2019t hire him. DeStefano is the president\u2019s official headhunter, responsible for filling up to 4, 000 political jobs \u2014 about 500 of which are really important jobs \u2014 in a government that his boss promised to clear of the permanent class of capital insiders to drain the Washington swamp. So the ideal applicant wouldn\u2019t have spent much of his career on Capitol Hill like DeStefano has, starting with a college internship.",
        "Congressional critics of the Department of Homeland Security should \u201cshut up\u2019\u2019 and assume the agency is acting appropriately and following the law, the agency\u2019s chief said in a combative public speech Tuesday. \u201cIf lawmakers do not like the laws they\u2019ve passed and we are charged to enforce, then they should have the courage and skill to change the laws,\u2019\u2019 Secretary John F. Kelly said. \u201cOtherwise they should shut up and support the men and women on the front lines.",
        "The Facebook video of a homicide was surely inevitable. This isn\u2019t the same as saying that video murders soon will become all the rage, but it was more likely to happen eventually than not. Forget the suspected killer, Steve W. Stephens, who took his own life Tuesday after a brief police pursuit. If not he, then someone else would have become \u201cthat guy who killed an old man while filming himself doing it. \u201d Shooting Robert Godwin Sr. was apparently a random act.",
        "The only modern president who rivaled Donald Trump in his lack of preparation for global leadership was Harry Truman. Both men took office with little knowledge of the international problems they were about to face, and with worries at home and abroad that they weren\u2019t up to the job. \u201cI pray God I can measure up to the task,\u201d Truman said right after Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s death and the shock of taking the oath of office. Trump wouldn\u2019t be human if he hadn\u2019t had a similar prayer in a corner of his mind on Jan. 20.",
        "The Hon. Kim Jong Un The Great Successor Sun of the 21st Century Supreme Leader Marshal of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea Ryongsong Residence Pyongyang, North Korea Dear Mr. Kim: I write to congratulate you on the occasion of your late grandfather\u2019s 105th birthday. I heard about the difficulties you had with the missile this weekend, but be assured that the launch was cheered by thousands of Muslims in Jersey City. Please forgive the impersonal nature of this correspondence, but a matter of this urgency cannot be left to the North Korean postal system.",
        "Contradicting expectations and her own explicit promises, British Prime Minister Theresa May has called a snap election. May is committed to the most misguided policy of any British government in memory \u2014 the foolish experiment in deglobalization known as Brexit. Yet such is the splintering of British politics, and the implosion of the opposition Labour Party under the of a nonentity, that May will probably win in a landslide.",
        "Up to Alaska last week to visit old friends and relive fragrant memories of previous trips. Landing on a short uphill grass strip near a native village and later taking off on that strip and off the edge of a cliff. Fishing in a fjord near Juneau as a dark enormity rolled up from the deep, a humpback 30 feet off starboard. Encountering a moose while biking around Anchorage. Sitting in a friendly cafe in Sitka that felt like family.",
        "RECEP TAYYIP Erdogan\u2019s ugly win in Sunday\u2019s referendum on a new, authoritarian constitution for Turkey creates big problems for the country\u2019s secular democratic forces and for Turkey\u2019s Western allies \u2014 but also for Mr. Erdogan himself. His victory was not convincing, as he had hoped, but narrow, contested and tainted by the finding of a European observer mission that the campaign was not free or fair. Turkey\u2019s three biggest cities voted against the strongman. The country is not united behind him, but polarized \u2014 a political reality that even an empowered ruler will ignore at his peril.",
        "Three people were killed in \u201crandom\u201d and \u201cunprovoked\u201d shootings that unfolded in a matter of seconds Tuesday morning in Fresno, Calif. authorities said. Police said they quickly arrested a suspect who they determined had previously expressed anger toward white people and the government. When the suspect was taken into custody, he yelled \u201cAllahu akbar,\u201d according to Jerry Dyer, the Fresno police chief. Authorities identified the suspect as Kori Ali Muhammad and described him as a man with a lengthy criminal history who went out Tuesday intending to kill people.",
        "President Trump\u2019s inaugural committee said Tuesday that it raised nearly $107 million for festivities surrounding his Jan. 20 about double the haul for any other incoming president. The previous high was $53 million for President Barack Obama\u2019s first inauguration in 2009. Trump\u2019s team set no limits on what corporations and individuals could contribute to the inaugural committee, which coordinated more than 20 events over six days to mark the arrival of the new Republican president. A filing by the committee with the Federal Election Commission was not yet available as of Tuesday evening.",
        "\u201cCleveland EMS, what is the emergency?\u201d the 911 dispatcher said. A frantic and frustrated 911 caller tried to describe a gruesome scene on Easter Sunday in East Cleveland, where Robert Godwin Sr. was lying on the pavement in a pool of his own blood. He had been gunned down by a stranger, for a reason that no one might ever understand. \u201cI told y\u2019all three times somebody laying in front of my house is dead \u2014 has been shot,\u201d the caller barked in agitation. \u201cAre you right there with him now?\u201d the dispatcher asked.",
        "This story has been updated. Health insurance executives seeking certainty on the future of federal funds that help Americans with their costs got no commitment that they would be paid next year in an meeting with Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) according to two insurance industry officials with knowledge of the meeting. A CMS official confirmed that Verma \u201cdid not comment\u201d on the payments, called reductions, at the meeting and told those gathered that it was a decision to be made by Congress.",
        "CHAMBLEE, Ga. \u2014 Volunteers for Democrat Jon Ossoff \u2014 mostly youthful, clad in navy blue and carrying bundles of materials \u2014 rushed excitedly around a campaign outpost here Tuesday to stoke turnout before polling locations close at 7 p. m. in Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District. That energy, a bustling example of the groundswell of liberal activism that has poured into this special House election in the wealthy Atlanta suburbs, may not be enough for Ossoff, a former congressional staffer, to prevail and capture a seat that has been in GOP hands since 1979.",
        "Tanya Gersh kept bags packed for her and her family, in case they had to flee their home in the middle of the night. She was terrified of answering the phone. Once, she picked it up and heard only the sounds of gunshots. Another caller threatened, \u201cwe can bury you without having to touch you. \u201d They came in through email: \u201cWe are going to have a field day with you scumbags,\u201d one anonymous person wrote to her.",
        "Steven Ginsberg is the senior politics editor for The Washington Post. Around 7:45 on election night, when Hillary Clinton and her aides still thought they were headed to the White House, troubling news emerged from Florida. Steve Schale, the best the Democrats had in the state, told campaign officials they were going to lose the biggest battleground in the country. Yes, Clinton was doing well in some places, but Donald Trump\u2019s numbers in Republican areas were inconceivably big.",
        "When Michael Elliott died, the last voice he heard was that of his his best friend. In a short phone conversation moments before Elliott took his last breath, she told him what he wanted to hear. \u201cI told him that everything\u2019s going to be all right,\u201d Teresa Elliott told The Washington Post. \u201cAnd Donald Trump has been impeached. \u201d Michael Elliott died \u201cpeacefully,\u201d surrounded by friends and neighbors in his home in a suburb outside of Portland, Ore. according to an obituary published in the Oregonian.",
        "(Jordi Pizarro) After 50 years of a military rule that banned anything that could spark a revolution, Burma has begun to embrace new cultural freedoms. Before the 2010 November elections, groups of five people or more were not allowed to gather on the street. But things have begun to change. For one group especially, that change is becoming evident: Burma\u2019s punks. In the past, punks had to remain underground and could even be jailed or tortured. In Burma, just as in other parts of the world where punks perform, song lyrics often challenge authority.",
        "Fox News on Wednesday ended its association with Bill O\u2019Reilly, the combative TV host and commentator who has ruled ratings for nearly two decades and was the signature figure in the network\u2019s rise as a powerful political player. The host\u2019s downfall was swift and steep, set in motion less than three weeks ago by revelations of a string of sexual harassment complaints against him. The questions about his conduct represented yet another black eye to Fox, which had dealt with a sexual harassment scandal involving its and Roger Ailes, just last summer.",
        "Gretchen Carlson filed suit against Roger Ailes last summer \u2014 and started an avalanche. Less than 10 months later, two of the most powerful men in media, Roger Ailes and Bill O\u2019Reilly, have been knocked off lofty perches at Fox News. And the world is suddenly a different place for women who\u2019ve experienced sexual harassment in their workplaces. \u201cThe lesson, and it\u2019s a wonderful one, is to be brave,\u201d business journalist and educator Micheline Maynard told me. \u201cAs women, we are taught not to speak out, not to ruffle feathers, to just be good and work harder,\u201d she said.",
        "Trump administration officials on Wednesday denied misleading the public about the location of an aircraft carrier and whether it was redeployed as a show of strength against North Korea. The whereabouts of the USS Carl Vinson, a aircraft carrier, and its accompanying strike group were swept up last week in an intensifying standoff between the United States and Pyongyang, which Washington has warned is risking American military action by pushing ahead with its disputed nuclear and missile programs.",
        "After riots and violent protests in and around their campus during the past three months, officials at the University of California at Berkeley said Wednesday that the school is canceling a planned speech by conservative firebrand Ann Coulter because of safety concerns. In a letter to a campus Republican group that invited Coulter to speak, university officials said that they made the decision to cancel Coulter\u2019s appearance after assessing the violence that flared on campus in February, when the same college Republican group invited provocateur and Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos to speak.",
        "Two issues are paramount in American politics. The first is whether President Trump will get away with his arrogant dismissal of the public\u2019s right to a transparent government free of corrupting conflicts of interest. The second is whether those who would hold him to account remain focused, mobilized and determined. They are related. There are many reasons to stand against Trump, but the one that should take precedence \u2014 because it is foundational for decent governance \u2014 is his autocratic assumption that he is above the expectations that apply to us normal humans.",
        "Bill O\u2019Reilly is finally out at Fox News. Hooray. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m not pleased. After $13 of sexual harassment claims, it was clearly time for him to go. Except \u2014 not time. Far past time. It\u2019s hard to gin up any sort of excitement for something so long overdue, done for such cynical reasons and in such a lackluster manner. Let\u2019s be clear: Fox News\u2019s premiere conservative commentator appears to be a serial harasser, with offenses cropping up regularly throughout his career at the network.",
        "Before he joined the Supreme Court a decade ago, John Roberts proclaimed what he called \u201cthe cardinal rule of judicial restraint: If it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more. \u201d But as he heard arguments Wednesday in this term\u2019s much anticipated case, the chief justice seemed to be practicing a different rule from the one he preached: More is more. Restraint was in short supply during oral arguments in the Trinity Lutheran Church case at the high court.",
        "William J. Burns, deputy U. S. secretary of state from 2011 to 2014, is president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. On the surface, much of President Trump\u2019s foreign policy seems to be reverting to the mainstream upon first contact with reality. Syrian dictator Bashar \u2019s horrific use of chemical weapons produced a quick military response, applauded across partisan lines in Washington. Relations with Russia have settled to predictably adversarial depths. The administration is full of appropriately reassuring words about NATO, and the policy was safely back in place for the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
        "Pavin Chachavalpongpun is an associate professor at Kyoto University\u2019s Center for Southeast Asian Studies. The military government in Thailand has a gift for Orwellian absurdity. Not long after seizing power in a 2014 coup, junta leader Gen. Prayuth published a song titled \u201cReturn Happiness to Thailand. \u201d Last year officials spotted a seditious conspiracy behind a plan to distribute red bowls as gifts (presumably because the color red is associated with the opposition). Thais have been arrested for allegedly making disrespectful remarks about the king\u2019s dog, and for eating a suspicious sandwich.",
        "WHEN EBOLA began to spread in West Africa in December 2013, it was invisible. A who had been playing near a tree in southeastern Guinea died, apparently the first victim, but it took months for health workers to detect and report the spread of a disease with a high mortality. Soon it raged across Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, sickening 28, 000 people and killing 11, 000. Scientists have now tracked the pathways of the virus in detail, providing important lessons for preventing another outbreak.",
        "The Supreme Court\u2019s newest look at the separation of church and state focused Wednesday on the hard and unforgiving surface of a church preschool\u2019s playground in Missouri. Trinity Lutheran Church in Columbia, Mo. wanted to participate in a state program that reimburses the cost of rubberizing the surface of playgrounds. But the state said that was not allowed. The exclusion has raised big questions about how to uphold the Constitution\u2019s prohibition on government support for religion without discriminating against those who are religious. \u201cIt\u2019s a fraught issue.",
        "One of the most House Republicans is rather abruptly stepping out of politics. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (Utah) chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, announced Wednesday that he won\u2019t be running for reelection in 2018 in his safely Republican district in suburban Salt Lake City. (function( a,b, c) )(document,\u201dscript\u201d,\u201d \u201d); Thank you! Thank you for allowing me to serve as your Representative in the United States House of Representatives. ... Posted by Jason Chaffetz on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 Chairmen of House committees don\u2019t just leave for no reason. So why is Chaffetz doing so?",
        "Standing before an American flag made out of wrenches at a Wisconsin tools company, President Trump on Tuesday promised \u201cbold, new steps\u201d to protect American workers and their wages and vowed to overhaul a guest worker visa program created to import \u201c \u201d foreign labor. But it turns out that Tools, where Trump signed his \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d executive order to much fanfare, pays wages to the handful of foreign workers for whom the company has sought visas. The practice, critics say, has the effect of driving down wages for American workers."
