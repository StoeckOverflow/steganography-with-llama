        "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Emirates, the Middle East\u2019s largest airline, slashed its flights to the United States by 20 percent Wednesday, blaming a drop in demand on tougher U. S. security measures and Trump administration attempts to ban travelers from some nations. The Dubai carrier\u2019s decision is the strongest sign yet that new measures imposed on U. S. travelers from the Mideast could be taking a financial toll on Gulf carriers that have expanded rapidly in the U. S.",
        "In place of an obituary for Aaron Hernandez there is only an unexplainable blank followed by a question mark. After all of the lethal contradictions of his life, did this killer, so promisingly great but with such eyes, resolve matters with the ultimate act of squandering and hang himself in the desolate shade of a jail cell? And if so, then so what? He was found not guilty (though not entirely) of a double murder Friday. He was dead, apparently by his own hand with a bedsheet, by Wednesday.",
        "The Environmental Protection Agency said this week that it would begin the process of shrinking its workforce through buyouts, in the wake of President Trump\u2019s executive order last month aimed at streamlining agencies throughout the federal government. In a letter to regional administrators and other agency officials, EPA acting deputy administrator Mike Flynn said the White House had asked federal agencies to begin taking \u201cimmediate actions\u201d aimed at reducing their workforce.",
        "A very large, very asteroid is whizzing past Earth on Wednesday, about 1. 1 million miles away. For perspective, that\u2019s about 4. 6 times the distance to the moon. That\u2019s close compared with the vastness of space, but in our universe it\u2019s waaaayyy out there. Good news: Wednesday is the closest this asteroid will get in 400 years, and it won\u2019t get this close again for at least 500 years. It\u2019s not going to hit Earth, and if it were, we\u2019d know it by now.",
        "The officer convicted so far in a colossal Navy corruption scandal began accepting a cornucopia of gifts and prostitutes from an Asian defense contractor 20 years ago and later suffered a mental breakdown when he learned authorities were making arrests in the case, new court documents allege. Robert J. Gilbeau became the first Navy admiral ever to be convicted of a felony when he pleaded guilty last year to lying to federal investigators. He is scheduled to be sentenced next month and likely faces up to 18 months in prison.",
        "Samantha Brookover and Amanda Abramovich had already done the most important part \u2014 a September 2014 ceremony, surrounded by family and friends in rural West Virginia, where they vowed to spend the rest of their lives together. But weeks later, when the state\u2019s Democratic governor announced that an appeals court ruling made marriage legal, Brookover and Abramovich were at the tiny Gilmer County courthouse to get their marriage certificate. \u201cYes, this was essentially a piece of paper, but at the same time it was the most exciting piece of paper we could ever get,\u201d Brookover told The Washington Post.",
        "Starbucks released its   Unicorn Frappuccino in stores Wednesday. (Maura   Washington Post)",
        "PARIS \u2014 A gunman opened fire on French police Thursday on Paris\u2019s boulevard, killing one officer and wounding two others before being fatally shot himself in an incident that raised the specter of renewed terrorism just three days before voters go to the polls to elect a new president. The Islamic State, through its affiliated Amaq News Agency, quickly claimed responsibility for the attack, which sent panicked pedestrians fleeing into side streets and prompted police to seal off the renowned close metro stations and order tourists back into their hotels.",
        "Federal prosecutors are weighing whether to bring criminal charges against members of the WikiLeaks organization, taking a second look at a 2010 leak of diplomatic cables and military documents and investigating whether the group bears criminal responsibility for the more recent revelation of sensitive CIA according to people familiar with the case. The Justice Department under President Barack Obama decided not to charge WikiLeaks for revealing some of the government\u2019s most sensitive secrets \u2014 concluding that doing so would be akin to prosecuting a news organization for publishing classified information.",
        "President Trump is pushing Congress toward another dramatic showdown over the Affordable Care Act, despite big outstanding obstacles to a beleaguered revision plan and a deadline next week to keep the government running. The fresh pressure from the White House to pass a revision was met with skepticism by some Capitol Hill Republicans and their aides, who were recently humiliated when their bill failed to reach the House floor for a vote and who worry now that little has changed to suggest a new revision would fare any better.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 After the 1987 stock market crash, sculptor Arturo Di Modica spent two years and $300, 000 secretly working on a gift he hoped would lift the spirits of a demoralized city. He deposited the \u201cCharging Bull\u201d statue in front of the New York Stock Exchange in the middle of a wintry night. Today, that icon of Wall Street prosperity is staring down another statue that has become a potent symbol in its own right \u2014 a petite girl in sneakers.",
        "Officials at the University of California at Berkeley on Thursday reversed their decision to cancel a speech by conservative firebrand Ann Coulter. The university had announced Wednesday that it was canceling Coulter\u2019s appearance following several political protests in Berkeley that turned violent. But on Thursday, the university said it had found a venue where it could hold the speech on May 2, instead of the original April 27 date.",
        "For those of us convinced that President Trump\u2019s defects of character, lack of knowledge, encouragement of social division and disregard for democratic norms outweigh any good he may do \u2014 the rough definition of being #NeverTrump \u2014 these are confusing and challenging times. Trump\u2019s solid basis of support is relatively homogeneous. It is fed up with foreigners, with foreign entanglements and with the political class as a whole. Its worst temptation is dehumanization \u2014 reducing migrants, refugees and Muslims to threatening types.",
        "House Republicans are apparently ready for yet another attempt to snatch health insurance away from constituents who need it. Someone should remind Speaker Paul Ryan of a saying often attributed to his legendary predecessor Sam Rayburn: \u201cThere\u2019s no education in the second kick of the mule. \u201d Having failed miserably to win passage of an abomination of a bill \u2014 the American Health Care Act \u2014 Ryan ( .) and his minions are back with something even worse.",
        "The crisis with North Korea may appear trumped up. It\u2019s not. Given that Pyongyang has had nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles for more than a decade why the panic now? Because North Korea is headed for a nuclear breakout. The regime has openly declared that it is racing to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the United States \u2014 and thus destroy an American city at a Kim Jong Un push of a button. The North Koreans are not bluffing.",
        "The Bill O\u2019Reilly saga has three villains: the revolting former anchor himself, the network that ignored accusations of serial abuse, and a broader system that punishes confrontation and enables silence and complicity. Each deserves flaying \u2014 along with President Trump, so eager to vouch for O\u2019Reilly and dismiss suggestions of wrongdoing. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s behavior \u2014 allegedly pressuring women to have sexual relationships, retaliating against them if they refused and warning them about coming forward \u2014 doesn\u2019t require much more in the way of condemnation. Let\u2019s focus, instead, on the disgraceful circumstances of his departure from Fox News.",
        "On June 8, Britain will hold an election",
        "SHUT IT down and close it up. That seems to be the default reaction of the Secret Service to any problem or failing \u2014 including its own \u2014 in protecting Washington buildings. The bunker mentality has turned the nation\u2019s capital into a place of unsightly bollards, barriers and guard booths. This week it struck again. The loss this time is not just of access to a sidewalk that offered a glorious view of the White House but further erosion of the openness that is \u2014 or should be \u2014 a hallmark of American democracy. As of 11 p. m.",
        "With Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s ouster from Fox News Channel, the hard part may be over for the network. Now the harder part begins. Fox\u2019s abrupt termination of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s contract on Wednesday puts the leading network in rebuilding mode, beset by uncertainty. Will O\u2019Reilly\u2019s loyal audience of roughly 4 million viewers stick around without O\u2019Reilly on the air? Will advertisers that abandoned O\u2019Reilly return to back his replacement? Will the loss of the network\u2019s most popular host set off a ripple effect that diminishes the rest of Fox\u2019s lineup?",
        "\u201cNo administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days. \u201d \u2014 President Trump, remarks in Kenosha, Wis. April 18, 2017 The first 100 days of a presidency mark a rather artificial milestone, but one by which all presidents have been measured since Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s whirlwind of action when he took office in the midst of the Great Depression. President Trump appears especially conscious of this marker. During the presidential campaign, he even issued a list of 60 promises that he said he would fulfill in his first 100 days.",
        "For the past few months, Russia\u2019s 175, 000 Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses have been on edge. After years, even decades, of persecution against the religious group, the Kremlin moved to get rid of the denomination for good. In February, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses were labeled \u201cextremists\u201d and locked out of their offices. Then Kremlin officials launched a legal effort to ban the faith. That case quickly wound its way to the Supreme Court, where Justice Ministry attorney Svetlana Borisova said the Christian group posed a \u201cthreat\u201d to \u201cpublic order and public security.",
        "At a time of remarkable tensions over Pyongyang\u2019s weapons program, satellite images of North Korea appeared to capture images of multiple volleyball games being played at the country\u2019s main nuclear testing site. The images, taken Sunday by satellite company Digitalglobe and later released by the independent North Korea monitoring project 38 North, appeared to show groups of people playing volleyball at three separate locations at the secretive nuclear facility. The images surprised analysts at 38 North, as they coincided with speculation about North Korean plans to test a nuclear weapon.",
        "First, candidate Donald Trump said a judge of Mexican descent couldn\u2019t give him a fair hearing. Now, President Trump\u2019s attorney general, Jeff Sessions, is suggesting that a judge from Hawaii \u2014 which he dismissively labels \u201can island in the Pacific\u201d \u2014 should not be able to strike down Trump\u2019s travel ban. Here\u2019s what Sessions told radio host Mark Levin on Wednesday, in audio uncovered by CNN\u2019s Andrew Kaczynski: We are confident that the president will prevail on appeal and particularly in the Supreme Court, if not the Ninth Circuit. So this is a huge matter.",
        "Neomi Rao, a law professor at George Mason University, could soon become one of the most powerful officials in Washington. President Trump has nominated the conservative lawyer to run the obscure but powerful Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, a gateway through which federal regulations must pass. The office, known as OIRA (pronounced ) would make Rao the Trump administration\u2019s regulatory czar, responsible for vetting and tallying cost estimates for most regulations. The office also resolves conflicts between agencies, and can either sink a rule or send it back for major rewrites.",
        "Washingtonians will have seats this weekend to witness what has become a familiar backyard scene: another protest on the Mall. Activists and scientists are expected to descend on the nation s capital Saturday to rally for environmental causes and government policies rooted in scientific research as part of the Earth Day and March for Science rallies. The demonstration comes a week after the Tax March and a week before the People s Climate March.",
        "During the nearly six weeks that Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas were missing, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation received more than 1, 500 tips. Late Wednesday night, the tip they were desperately hoping for finally arrived. It came from a caller who told investigators that the Cummins and the teenager he is accused of abducting might be living in a remote cabin near Cecilville, Calif. a onetime mining town about 100 miles from the Oregon border.",
        "Arkansas officials entered this week hoping to begin an unprecedented wave of executions, but court orders imperiled those plans and forced the state to abandon at least some of the planned lethal injections. By Thursday night, authorities in Arkansas had apparently given up on half of the planned executions and were focused on a lethal injection scheduled for a state prison southeast of Little Rock. One of two executions planned for that night was called off after a court issued a stay, while another inmate was still facing off with state officials over his pending appeals.",
        "A wave of candidates eager to fight President Trump and his young administration plan to challenge House Republican incumbents, giving Democratic Party leaders hope that they can capi tal ize on the anger and intensity at protests and town hall meetings across the country this year. At least 15 declared candidates or contenders on the verge of announcing have emerged in districts that Democrats must win to take back the House, including in several districts where the party did not seriously compete in 2014 or 2016, according to party officials.",
        "President Trump scrambled Friday to show progress on two leading priorities \u2014 reform and tax cuts \u2014 ahead of his 100th day in office, even as he dismissed that marker as a \u201cridiculous standard\u201d and suggested the media would judge him unfairly when he reaches it next week. Trump told the Associated Press in an interview that he would release a tax package next week that would include reductions \u201cbigger, I believe, than any tax cut ever. \u201d He provided no specifics but said he would outline his plan \u201cWednesday or shortly thereafter.",
        "Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Friday demanded that nine jurisdictions produce proof that they are communicating with federal authorities about undocumented immigrants or risk losing grant funding. Sessions sent letters to the nine jurisdictions, including Philadelphia, New York and Chicago, in the latest sign that the Trump administration intends to punish what are sometimes called sanctuary cities that do not cooperate in its promised crackdown on illegal immigration."
