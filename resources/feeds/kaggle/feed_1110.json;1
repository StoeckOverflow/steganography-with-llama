        "Supreme Court Justice Neil M. Gorsuch cast his first consequential vote Thursday night, siding with the court\u2019s other four conservatives in denying a stay request from Arkansas inmates facing execution. Hours later, the state executed one of the men, the first lethal injection carried out there since 2005. New justices have described being the final word on whether a inmate is executed \u2014 often during a appeal to the Supreme Court \u2014 as a time when the responsibility of the role crystallizes. Indeed, one of the court\u2019s most solid supporters, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr.",
        "The accuser was wavering. She wanted to go public, to tell the world about her claims that the Fox News megastar Bill O\u2019Reilly ogled her at their workplace and suggestively called her \u201chot chocolate. \u201d But Perquita Burgess was afraid, her attorney Lisa Bloom said. Afraid of Twitter trolls and other haters. Afraid that a powerful man would ruin her life for daring to cross him. So, Bloom invoked civil rights history to say the words that finally persuaded Burgess, a former Fox temp worker who is African American.",
        "PARIS \u2014 French authorities on Friday identified a criminal, apparently inspired by the Islamic State, as the perpetrator of a deadly attack on police officers in a shooting that set France on edge and darkened the final day of campaigning in the country\u2019s pivotal presidential election. Despite a promise not to campaign following the attack Thursday night on Paris\u2019s renowned boulevard, candidate Marine Le Pen reinforced her message in a Friday speech, calling on the French government to immediately reinstate border checks and expel foreigners being monitored by the intelligence services.",
        "One of the dumbest games played in Washington is when politicians say nice things about other politicians but insist they aren\u2019t \u201dendorsing\u201d them. President Trump is now playing that game with the candidate for French president, Marine Le Pen. After French police officers were shot in Paris on Thursday, Trump quickly pointed the finger at terrorism \u2014 before the motive had been publicly determined. \u201dThat\u2019s a very, very terrible thing that\u2019s going on in the world today,\u201d Trump said at a White House news conference with the Italian prime minister. \u201dBut it looks like another terrorist attack.",
        "PARIS \u2014 Of the four candidates with a realistic chance to become France\u2019s next president, three oppose Western sanctions against Russia. Two would take France out of NATO\u2019s military command, or perhaps remove it from the alliance altogether. And the one candidate who fits neither category would dramatically increase European defense cooperation to lessen dependence on what he regards as an unreliable United States. When French voters make their choices Sunday in the first round of the country\u2019s utterly unpredictable presidential race, the status quo for Western security won\u2019t be on the ballot.",
        "In his first annual message to Congress, John Quincy Adams, among the most experienced and intellectually formidable presidents, warned leaders against giving the impression that \u201cwe are palsied by the will of our constituents. \u201d In this regard, if in no other, the 45th president resembles the sixth. Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cOh, never mind\u201d presidency was produced by voters stung by the contempt they detected directed toward them by the upper crust. Their insurrection has been rewarded by Trump\u2019s swift shedding of campaign commitments, a repudiation so comprehensive and cavalier that he disdains disguising his disdain for his gulled supporters.",
        "Foreign leaders and local interlocutors, a. k. a. pundits, might as well take a vacation for the next few minutes until President Trump\u2019s next foreign policy \u201cstrategy\u201d surfaces from deep within his amygdala. For to presume a strategy when Trump toys with potentially lethal nations \u2014 threatening to tear apart the nuclear agreement with Iran or putting North Korea on notice that doom may befall it any moment \u2014 is to imagine that a toddler has given grave consideration to the gravitational aspects of toppling his brother\u2019s Lego edifice.",
        "Matthew Algeo is the author of five books, including \u201cPedestrianism: When Watching People Walk Was America\u2019s Favorite Spectator Sport. \u201d In his first 88 days in office, President Trump went golfing 14 times \u2014 an average of once every 6. 3 days. At that rate, he\u2019ll end up golfing far more frequently than President Barack Obama, who golfed once every 9. 5 days and whom Trump often criticized for spending too much time on the links. Golf is always a risky undertaking for a president.",

He called for killing family members of terrorists, said he would do \u201ca hell of a lot worse than waterboarding\u201d terrorism suspects and suggested that a U. S. federal judge of Mexican heritage couldn\u2019t be neutral because of his ethnicity. He whipped up animosity against Muslims and immigrants from Mexico, branding the latter as \u201crapists. \u201d When protesters interrupted his rallies, he cheered violence against them.",
        "ANY DOUBT that the West is experiencing a profound political crisis can be dispatched with a glance at the final polls for the first round of France\u2019s presidential election Sunday. They show what looks like a dead heat for the two places in a May 7 runoff. Two of the candidates, the Marine Le Pen and the M\u00e9lenchon, represent political extremes that reject virtually everything that France has stood for since the founding of the Fifth Republic in 1958.",

        "Ann Coulter rejected an offer to speak at the University of California at Berkeley on a new date after the university canceled her event because of safety concerns, then quickly reversed itself, saying it would reschedule her speech. Coulter said she can\u2019t attend on the new date and accused the university of continuing to try to place restrictions on her free speech.

        "TOKYO \u2014 If the United States were to strike North Korea, Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime would retaliate by unleashing its conventional weaponry lined up on the demilitarized zone that has separated the two Koreas for about seven decades. And that conventional weaponry is reliable, unlike North Korea\u2019s missiles, and could cause major devastation in South Korea, which is a staunch ally of the United States. \u201cThis becomes a very limiting factor for the U. S.,\u201d said Carl Baker, a retired Air Force officer with extensive experience in South Korea.",
        "During a break in a basketball game to raise money for charity, Shon Hopwood told some of his Georgetown law students it felt different than the last time he was on a court: When he played basketball in federal prison, he had to carry a shank in case his team started to lose.

Frank Artiles ( ) said Friday morning in a resignation letter to Senate President Joe Negron that he was accepting responsibility for his actions \u2014 days after fellow legislators started pushing for his expulsion. \u201cIt is clear to me my recent actions and words that I spoke fell far short of what I expect for myself, and for this I am very sorry,\u201d he wrote in the letter.",

        "There\u2019s something about money and men. Researchers have long shown a link between men\u2019s identities and their income: Men tend to work more hours if faced with the threat of their wife earning as much as they do. When men make less money than their wives, they tend to do less housework, not more. And when men are in their marriages, they\u2019re even more likely to use erectile dysfunction medicine or show greater rates of depression.",

And she hasn\u2019t been able to find a job for the past five years because the government refuses to change her passport.

        "Thousands of people gathered in the rain Saturday on the soggy grounds of the Washington Monument to turn Earth Day into an homage to science.

The recent demonstrations have drawn huge crowds but appear unlikely to force Maduro to accept demands for new elections and a return to democratic rule. So opposition leaders are making unusually direct appeals to the country\u2019s military leaders, imploring them to rein in the president and defy orders to suppress the demonstrations."
