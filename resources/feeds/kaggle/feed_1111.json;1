        "Henrietta Lacks probably didn\u2019t seem so immortal to doctors when she was first diagnosed at Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1951. The poor African American woman \u2014 the subject of a book, \u201cThe Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,\u201d and a new HBO movie starring Oprah Winfrey \u2014 was suffering from cervical cancer. \u201cIt was generally a death sentence then,\u201d said Patricia Eifel, a professor of radiation oncology at the MD Anderson Center in Houston. Today, the disease is considered a cancer success story.",
        "Who is Alex Emerick Jones, really? Is the InfoWars founder an intemperate Barack conspiracy theorist who believes the government has weaponized the weather and Lady Gaga\u2019s Super Bowl halftime show was a satanic ritual? Or is he a nurturing, doting father, perfectly suited to attend to the emotional needs of his three impressionable children? Those questions are at the heart of the battle going on in a Texas courtroom as Jones and his spar over custody of their children. For the first time since the hearing started, Jones has weighed in publicly.",
        "American Airlines said it is investigating an incident in which a male flight attendant reportedly upset a female passenger to the point of tears, then later was recorded getting into a heated confrontation with a male passenger who tried to come to the woman\u2019s defense. \u201cWe have seen the video and have already started an investigation to obtain the facts,\u201d American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott said in an email to The Washington Post. \u201cWhat we see on this video does not reflect our values or how we care for our customers.",
        "France \u2014 The General rests in peace. In the graveyard of a small stone church in this afterthought of a country village, Charles de Gaulle \u2014 the founding father of modern France \u2014 enjoys the repose only awarded to the \u201cgreat men\u201d of history. Tourists traipse through his house; admirers bow their heads at the grave of the man who transformed his country into a vital player on the global stage. But these days, the future of the France he built and its status in the world are suddenly in jeopardy.",
        "Warning: This article may give you a headache \u2014 and if reading an article about the best way to cut the cable cord causes pain, imagine researching and writing it. The options are overwhelming, and no one solution does it all, although watching live sports without cable is no longer a problem. There are crazy contradictions to consider, such as how sometimes \u201c \u201d bundles (TV, Internet and phone) are actually cheaper than \u201c \u201d options (Internet and phone) because of specials. But in all the confusion, one thing is clear: Cable TV is expensive.",
        "Louisa Bargeron loved the ceilings, the fireplace with the original tile and the tub in her at the venerable Ontario in Adams Morgan. The hodgepodge kitchen, the cracked ancient bathroom tile and her collection of mismatched furniture \u2014 not so much. Bargeron felt unsure of how to get her taste and personality, and a bit of girly glam, into her home while keeping its historical character. So she reached out to Washington designers Kiera Kushlan and Jessica Centella of Residents Understood.",
        "Rebecca never wanted an engagement ring. For her first marriage, a freelance writer and editor in Chicago, had a $6, 000 ring. \u201cI hated every second of wearing it, because we had a really tough time financially, and I was walking around with thousands of dollars on my hand. And I thought we could get rid of so many problems if I could just take this off and not have it anymore,\u201d she said, adding that she also didn\u2019t feel safe walking around with it.",
        "Congress has until midnight on April 28 to pass a spending bill to keep the government open through September or face a government shutdown. And budget experts we spoke to think it could go either way. Congress has its usual red lines that make a deal that will please a majority of both chambers nearly impossible. But this time, the wild card on whether there will be a shutdown is President Trump.",
        "President Trump and White House officials pressed congressional Republicans on Sunday to use the looming threat of a government shutdown to win funding for a wall along the border between the United States and Mexico, a top priority for the administration as it nears the symbolic mark. Trump wants funding to be included in a spending measure that would keep the government open past April 28, a determined effort that has prompted a possible standoff with lawmakers in both parties, who hope to avert a federal closure next weekend.",
        "Top Trump administration officials are giving out differing accounts of a tax plan that the president has promised will be released Wednesday, calling into question whether they have ironed out some of the most difficult components of any proposal. Among the major decisions President Trump and his party face on taxes is whether to go for a tax cut that keeps much of the existing tax code intact but reduces rates or whether to go for a more fundamental shift that makes changes to how the government collects revenue.",
        "During a small working lunch at the White House last month, the question of job security in President Trump\u2019s tumultuous White House came up, and one of the attendees wondered whether press secretary Sean Spicer might be the first to go. The president\u2019s response was swift and unequivocal. \u201cI\u2019m not firing Sean Spicer,\u201d he said, according to someone familiar with the encounter. \u201cThat guy gets great ratings. Everyone tunes in. \u201d Trump even likened Spicer\u2019s daily news briefings to a daytime soap opera, noting proudly that his press secretary attracted nearly as many viewers.",
        "PARIS \u2014 French voters on Sunday rejected the two political parties that dominated France\u2019s War II political life, pitting an firebrand against an unconventional centrist in a presidential election that could determine the future of the European Union and France\u2019s place in the world. By picking the . U. former economy minister Emmanuel Macron and National Front leader Marine Le Pen to advance to the decisive May 7 runoff, French citizens set up a stark choice.",
        "The moment he emerged onstage in a black jacket and red bow tie, the crowd noise hit decibels. A sea of iPhones appeared, everyone stretching and jostling for the best possible photo angle. They cupped their hands to their mouths, screaming his name. \u201cGreetings, fellow citizens,\u201d Bill Nye said to the thousands huddled beneath umbrellas and signs. \u201cWe are marching today to remind people everywhere, our lawmakers especially, of the significance of science for our health and prosperity.",
        "True to the spirit of 1789, the revolutionary French are a step ahead of everyone else. On Sunday, they became the first large Western country to ditch, in a major election, the structure that has dominated European politics since the Second World War. Neither Emmanuel Macron nor Marine Le Pen, the two candidates who emerged from the first round of voting for the French presidency, belongs to the old gauche or the old droite. Neither will have a major parliamentary party behind his or her program. Neither, as president, would represent a continuation of the status quo.",
        "With last Sunday\u2019s controversial and contested referendum, Turkey\u2019s nondemocratic future is clear. The 18 constitutional amendments that Turks approved promise to set the country firmly in an authoritarian direction that will be difficult to reverse. With broad new powers, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan can rule with virtual impunity. The conduct of the referendum, which international observers have declared unfair, and its outcome are part of a broader story about Turkey\u2019s transformation from a candidate for European Union membership to autocracy. How did this happen? There are a number of competing and hotly debated explanations.",
        "This weekend marks the 47th Earth Day, an annual celebration of our pale blue dot. As we reflect on the ground beneath our feet and the flora and fauna whose lives are entwined with ours, it\u2019s worth giving equal consideration to the vast oceans just beyond our shores. The high seas are as vital to life on Earth as terra firma, and with their hugeness and depth, they provide that much more room for myths and mysteries. Here are five of the most persistent. Myth No. 1 Coastlines are clear boundaries between land and sea.",
        "REMEMBER HOW President Trump was going to construct a wall along the border between the United States and Mexico \u201d paid for by Mexico? There s been a change of plans. Now Mr. Trump wants the Democrats to put up the cash. All right; that s a slight exaggeration. What s actually happening is that the government s current spending authority runs out April 29. Without a new bill, the country could face a partial shutdown of federal agencies. No one, Mr. Trump included, wants that, and the two parties are negotiating a deal to avoid it.",
        "The Trump administration is struggling to explain precisely what it intends to do about people who are in the country illegally. President Trump told the Associated Press on Friday that the \u201cdreamers\u201d \u2014 people brought into the country illegally as children and now protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program put in place under President Barack Obama \u2014 should \u201crest easy\u201d and not worry about deportation.",
        "PRINCETON, W. Va. \u2014 Gym is Trenton Tolliver\u2019s favorite class. But the is also a huge fan of the weekly Bible course at Princeton Primary, his public elementary school. He gets to play matching games about Bible stories and listen to classic tales. Noah and the Ark is a favorite. Adam and Eve and the garden of Eden, of course. And the story about how their son Cain killed his brother, Abel.",
        "Earlier this year, when Rupert Murdoch and senior executives at Fox News\u2019s parent company signed Bill O\u2019Reilly to a new multiyear contract, they knew something the rest of the world didn\u2019t: The star host had been accused of sexual and verbal harassment by women at Fox five times over the preceding 15 years. They knew it because the company, 21st Century Fox, had paid money to settle two of the complaints. They also knew that the public was unlikely to find out because attorneys for O\u2019Reilly and the company had signed his accusers to agreements binding them to confidentiality.",
        "President Trump nears the mark of his administration as the least popular chief executive in modern times, a president whose voters remain largely satisfied with his performance, but one whose base of support has not expanded since he took the oath of office, according to a new Washington News poll. Trump\u2019s first months in office have produced some tangible successes. Beyond the continued enthusiasm of his most loyal supporters, a small majority of Americans see him as a strong leader. A bigger majority approves of his efforts to pressure U. S. companies to keep jobs in this country.",
        "Chelsea Clinton was one of the honorees at Variety\u2019s Power of Women New York luncheon on Friday, but that didn\u2019t stop host Vanessa Bayer from making a joke at the Clinton family\u2019s expense. In her opening monologue at the event, the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d comedian introduced the six women who would be honored that afternoon: Jessica Chastain, Gayle King, Blake Lively, Audra McDonald, Tina Knowles, Shari Redstone and Clinton. \u201cAnd they all have one thing in common,\u201d Bayer quipped. \u201cNone of their moms are president. \u201d The audience groaned a little at that point.",
        "Just a few months ago, not many knew about these five from a community in Indianapolis. But now, the Panther Bots, a thriving robotics team at Pleasant Run Elementary School, have become the face of a success story about a group of kids who were taunted with racial slurs but were too determined to let that affect their confidence. Earlier this month, they found themselves being honored on the Senate floor of the Indiana Statehouse. The group travels to Louisville on Sunday to compete in a worldwide robotics contest. \u201cI cried. I literally cried.",
        "Jim Hall calls the lynching of Shedrick Thompson \u201can open wound\u201d in Fauquier County, Va. It could heal, the former newspaper reporter believes, but only if residents would open up to what happened in 1932 about 20 miles north of Warrenton, the county seat. In his book, \u201cThe Last Lynching in Northern Virginia,\u201d he explored the hanging and subsequent burning of the black man \u2014 and his attack on a white couple that preceded it.",
        "Most hotel rooms are a blur, says Maxwell Young. But there is one part of his stay at the Hotel Palomar in Northwest Washington that he will always remember: the and robes hanging in his room. \u201cIt was like I opened the closet and rays of sunshine poured out,\u201d he said of the bathrobes, which he later raved about on Twitter. (\u201cSnow may have put a crimp in our DC plans, but this zebra robe at @Kimpton Palomar Hotel is really lifting my mood.",
        "The White House sought Monday to calm a jittery Washington ahead of a showdown with Congress over spending, and President Trump softened his demand that a deal to keep the federal government open include money to begin construction on his border wall. Despite control at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, the brinkmanship that came to define spending battles in the Obama years has tumbled into the Trump era, as have the factional divisions over strategy and priorities that have gripped the GOP for a decade.",
        "President Trump is pursuing a drastic cut in the corporate tax rate, a move that is likely to grow the national debt and breach a Republican goal of curbing federal borrowing. The president has instructed advisers to propose cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, according to White House officials who said they were not authorized to speak publicly about the plan. The rate reduction \u2014 which independent budget experts say could cost the federal government $2. 4 trillion over a decade \u2014 is larger than what House Republicans had proposed in their own plan.",
        "Will President Trump and congressional Republicans ever understand one another? Over time, they might accomplish things of mutual interest. Big things, perhaps. But the mismatch between the disrupter president and what has been a Congress seems especially evident as the mark of the administration nears. The president came to Washington on a mission to shake up the status quo. He prizes big and bold action and, absent that, a little showmanship. He wants to make this week one of the best of his short tenure, so he\u2019s loading up with activities that will keep him visible and in motion.",
        "TORNILLO, Tex. \u2014 Midterm elections are known to be brutal on the party in power, and if there is an wave in 2018, look for it to touch shore right here. The vast, volatile 23rd Congressional District of Texas is bigger in area than 29 states. It stretches from San Antonio to El Paso and includes about of the entire U. S. border. Its overwhelmingly Latino electorate last year went for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. But it also reelected a Republican to the U. S.",
        "The Trump administration announced on Monday that it is planning to impose a roughly 20 percent tariff on softwood lumber imported from Canada, a new escalation of trade tensions with America\u2019s northern neighbor. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in an interview that his department had reached a preliminary decision to impose the tax, the administration\u2019s first major trade action against Canada."
