        "In the annals of pathetic this tweet from President Trump deserves a special place of honor, or perhaps dishonor: \u201cEventually, but at a later date so we can get started early, Mexico will be paying, in some form, for the badly needed border wall. \u201d To put those weasel words in context, let me ask a question of all you owners out there. If a customer brings some merchandise to the cash register and promises that one of his neighbors will pay you for it \u201ceventually . . . at a later date . . .",
        "Eric Liu, founder of Citizen University and executive director of the Aspen Institute Citizenship & American Identity Program, is the author of \u201cYou\u2019re More Powerful Than You Think: A Citizen\u2019s Guide to Making Change Happen. \u201d As Donald Trump approaches the 100th day of his presidency, let\u2019s give him credit: He has sparked one of the greatest surges of American citizen action in half a century. Indeed, this burst of civic renewal may be more enduring than anything else he has done in his chaotic first months on the job.",
        "It was a tokin\u2019 gesture. Marijuana users are feeling a bit paranoid about Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s threats to crack down on states (and the District) that have legalized marijuana. So on Monday, at \u201chigh noon,\u201d activists gathered on the Capitol lawn for what they called a \u201cjoint session,\u201d and they appealed to a higher authority. They brought in a \u201cganjapreneur,\u201d a \u201chemperor,\u201d a Rastafarian and a dozen activists wearing what looked like Keebler elf hats \u2014 and they held a \u201creligious ceremony\u201d for the protection of their sacred herb.",
        "Government officials often pay lip service to \u201csupporting our troops. \u201d But some of the people who literally do that vital work have just been badly shortchanged. For at least the third time in two years, the National Guard Bureau has awarded a contract for military family services to a lowball bidder. For the third time, that bid was based on plans to cut workers\u2019 pay by about a third on average, and in some cases by half.",
        "My friend, but otherwise admirable, has an odd way of spending his free time. He flies to some of the world\u2019s most Godforsaken places and tries to help some of the world\u2019s most Godforsaken people. This is how he got to the Dadaab refugee camp on the border, a moonscape of trees adorned with errant plastic bags, where young men, such as the ones my friend encountered, until recently dreamed of America. No longer, though. \u201cWe are not wanted anymore,\u201d one of the refugees said. \u201cAmerica is not a friendly place.",
        "PRESIDENT TRUMP campaigned on a promise to build a wall between Mexico and the United States. Now, with Congress having to renew federal spending authority by week\u2019s end, he believes he\u2019s entitled to a down payment on that wall. What\u2019s wrong with that logic? A number of things, but this above all: No responsible leader would use the possible shutdown of the federal government as a political cudgel.",
        "BERLIN \u2014 In this era of fiery populism and muscular forces, politicians across Europe are suddenly discovering an electoral surprise. It might actually pay to embrace the European Union. The top finisher in the first round of the French presidential election on Sunday is Emmanuel Macron, a centrist who jets to Berlin to give speeches in English. The banner of the E. U. flutters off his campaign headquarters. He is strongly favored to beat his rival, Marine Le Pen, in a May 7 runoff. After years in which the E. U.",
        "President Trump will sign an executive order Wednesday instructing the Interior Department to review national monument designations his three predecessors have made over the past 21 years, according to administration officials and GOP lawmakers, a move that could upend protections that previous presidents have put in place in Utah and elsewhere across the country. Presidents of both parties have invoked their executive authority under the 1906 Antiquities Act to provide safeguards for federal lands and waters. But some of these moves \u2014 including Barack Obama\u2019s designation of the 1.",
        "Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote Monday that the court is developing a \u201cdisturbing trend\u201d of siding with police officers accused of excessive force at the expense of their alleged victims, a notion disputed by two of her colleagues. Sotomayor was arguing that the court should have accepted the case of Richardo who was shot in the back by Houston police officer Chris Thompson in 2010. A federal district judge dismissed \u2019s suit before trial, and the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld that decision.",
        "The White House announced Monday that it would host an unusual private briefing on North Korea for the entire Senate, prompting questions from lawmakers about whether the Trump administration intends to use the event as a photo op ahead of its mark. Press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters that the lawmakers would be briefed Wednesday by several senior administration officials, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. He emphasized that the meeting plan had been convened by Senate leadership and that the White House was serving \u201cas the location.",
        "Days after Arkansas pushed back on legal challenges and carried out its first execution in more than a decade, officials there returned to the execution chamber Monday to carry out one death sentence and planned for a second later in the night. The lethal injections, if both are ultimately carried out, would be the country\u2019s first double execution since 2000, when Texas executed two convicted murderers, and the first time a state has attempted to carry out two death sentences in one night since a widely publicized botch in Oklahoma in 2014.",
        "On the same day that some southern states were honoring their rebel heritage, masked workers in New Orleans dismantled a monument to that past \u2014 chunk by chunk, under darkness and the protection of police snipers. \u201cWe will no longer allow the Confederacy to literally be put on a pedestal,\u201d Mayor Mitch Landrieu (D) said after a obelisk honoring what the mayor called \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d was taken down early Monday.",
        "CHICAGO \u2014 In his first public appearance since leaving the White House in January, former president Barack Obama told young leaders here Monday that \u201cspecial interests dominate the debates in Washington\u201d and that getting involved in their communities is the best antidote to the divisiveness dominating the country\u2019s politics.",
        "The shopping bag is an infamous source of plastic pollution. The 2010 documentary \u201cBag It\u201d estimated that Americans use 102 billion plastic bags per year. Bags are persistent. Plastic at the waste dump can last for an estimated 1, 000 years. And they are pernicious. A wild baby manatee named Emoji died in a Florida zoo in February after filling its guts with plastic bags and other litter. To curb our reliance on cheap plastic, Washington began levying bag fees in 2009. Several other municipalities have followed suit. Of course, plastic bags are useful, too.",
        "The rear door on a church van traveling along Highway 65 in northern Arkansas swung open, with a child hanging from the handle. video showed a girl hang briefly from the door before she let go, hitting the pavement and rolling into traffic. EMT and volunteer firefighter Ryan Ciampoli, who was driving behind the van when the unthinkable happened Wednesday, said he swerved to signal drivers behind him that something was wrong. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe what I was seeing,\u201d Ciampoli told The Washington Post. He pulled over and ran to the girl, who, he said, was initially unconscious.",
        "A rare second parchment copy of the Declaration of Independence has been found \u2014 in England. The discovery was made by Harvard University researchers Emily Sneff and Danielle Allen, according to a university news release published Friday. The pair located the rare document in a records office in Chichester, a city near England\u2019s southern coast. The first clue that the document existed came in 2015, when Sneff spotted an unusual listing from a catalogue for the West Sussex Record Office: \u201cManuscript copy, on parchment, of the Declaration in Congress of the thirteen United States of America.",
        "As the Nazis marched toward France, the Schloss family knew Hitler\u2019s agents would come for their father\u2019s art. Adolphe Schloss, a Jewish art collector, had compiled more than 300 paintings by Flemish and Dutch artists \u2014 still regarded as one of the best collections of his time. When he died, he left the collection to his wife, and it passed to their children before the outbreak of World War II. But Adolf Hitler wanted the collection for his museum, part of the Nazi\u2019s plan to simply take cultural artifacts owned by Jews.",
        "Jonathan Newton is a photojournalist at The Washington Post. He contributed this essay to In Sight. The chorus of Mr. Stewart\u2019s Cheshire Foxhounds has echoed in the hills of the Brandywine Valley in southern Pennsylvania for more than a century. The hunt country encompasses more than 30, 000 acres that run through fields and farms near the picturesque towns of Coatesville, Unionville and Kennett Square. The hunt, beginning in 1912, is named after W. Plunket Stewart, who bought up land and hounds to begin what continues to this day as one of the finest fox hunts in the country.",
        "A federal judge in San Francisco dealt the Trump administration another legal blow Tuesday, temporarily halting President Trump\u2019s threat to withhold federal funding from cities and towns that refuse to cooperate with immigration authorities. U. S. District Judge William H. Orrick imposed a nationwide injunction against a Jan. 25 executive order authorizing the attorney general to withhold federal grant money from what are called sanctuary jurisdictions that do not cooperate with U. S. immigration officials.",
        "White House officials and several Republican lawmakers claimed Tuesday they were nearing a deal on legislation with the House Freedom Caucus, with at least three leading figures in the group ready to support an overhaul after the dramatic collapse of talks last month. Reps. Mark Meadows ( . C.) Jim Jordan ( ) and Ra\u00fal R. Labrador ( ) \u2014 all leaders of the Freedom Caucus and central figures in the latest discussions \u2014 signaled Tuesday they are ready to support a new plan, according to two White House officials who were not authorized to speak publicly.",
        "A new Republican bid to keep the government open past Friday includes no fresh money for the construction of a wall along the U. S. border, diminishing the chances of a spending fight. The decision to withdraw a roughly $1. 5 billion request to begin building a physical barrier between the two countries may eliminate the White House\u2019s best chance to secure the funding and begin construction this year. Nonetheless, President Trump and his aides vowed Tuesday that a wall will be built by the end of his current term.",
        "The final frenzy at the White House began Monday, with a private reception for conservative news publications, a tariff on softwood lumber imports from Canada and the debut of a website highlighting President Trump\u2019s \u201cFirst 100 Days\u201d achievements. It continued Tuesday in the form of an executive order designed to help farmers and ranchers, an assurance that construction will begin soon on a wall along the nation\u2019s southern border \u2014 \u201cThe wall\u2019s going to get built,\u201d the president said \u2014 and media briefings by senior administration officials who gave their takes on Trump\u2019s successes.",
        "The University of California at Berkeley is bracing for massive protests and potential violence in an open, public space known as Sproul Plaza after learning that conservative commentator Ann Coulter plans to give a speech there Thursday afternoon. The state flagship university has become ground zero for an intense confrontation between the far left and the far right since President Trump\u2019s election in November, with some protesters trying to stop controversial speakers from appearing on campus and others objecting that such actions violate their right to free speech.",
        "Julian Assange is editor of WikiLeaks. Mike Pompeo, in his first speech as director of the CIA, chose to declare war on free speech rather than on the United States\u2019 actual adversaries. He went after WikiLeaks, where I serve as editor, as a \u201c hostile intelligence service. \u201d In Pompeo\u2019s worldview, telling the truth about the administration can be a crime \u2014 as Attorney General Jeff Sessions quickly underscored when he described my arrest as a \u201cpriority.",
        "Daniel Lee is a writer who lives in Indiana. WASHINGTON, Ind. This city of 11, 000, nestled among a handful of low hills rising from Hoosier farm fields, is 680 miles from the other Washington, but the cultural and political divide may be even greater than the geographical distance. Solidly red Indiana backed Donald Trump by 57 percent to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 37 percent.",
        "We\u2019ve already seen that repealing Obamacare is politically perilous. Now there\u2019s a new complication: It may also violate international law. The United Nations has contacted the Trump administration as part of an investigation into whether repealing the Affordable Care Act without an adequate substitute for the millions who would lose health coverage would be a violation of several international conventions that bind the United States. It turns out that the notion that \u201chealth care is a right\u201d is more than just a Democratic talking point. A confidential, \u201curgent appeal\u201d from the Office of the U. N.",
        "As Donald Trump approaches the marker of his first year in office, he has defined himself not as the Dealmaker in Chief but as the Backdown President. What a deliciously strange irony that until Monday night he set the stage for a government shutdown over, of all things, his campaign centerpiece \u2014 The Wall. Strange because Trump, who now calls the faux deadline \u201cridiculous,\u201d promised so much by his 100th day. Delicious because everything Trump does is scrumptious, especially eating chocolate cake while launching real missiles.",
        "TEL AVIV As President Trump nears the benchmark, it\u2019s a good moment to examine the relationship that has evolved between the mercurial and inexperienced commander in chief and his unflappable defense secretary, Jim Mattis. It\u2019s an unlikely partnership, but so far it mostly seems to work. Trump may have relatively few accomplishments to show after three months, but he can take credit for selecting a generally solid team and for listening to its advice.",
        "PRESIDENT TRUMP is set to reveal the outlines of a tax reform plan Wednesday. The country will be improved if Mr. Trump leads the way toward lower rates, fewer loopholes and a simpler code. Where the plan could go dangerously astray is if the administration bases it on wishful thinking \u2014 specifically, that will pay for itself. Specifics have been sketchy in the to Wednesday\u2019s announcement, in part because administration officials appear to be of different minds. But a few details emerged early in the week. The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr.",
        "In a May 2014 email to a recruit, Michigan State gymnastics coach Kathie Klages listed reasons the young woman should pick the school. Klages touted the value of a Michigan State education and boasted the Spartans gymnastics team was one of the best in the country. Then Klages mentioned an aspect of Michigan State no other school could offer. \u201cWe have Larry Nassar!\u201d Klages wrote, referring to the longtime physician for USA Gymnastics\u2019 women\u2019s team \u2014 renowned for his ability to keep Olympic gymnasts healthy \u2014 who taught at Michigan State\u2019s medical school and treated Spartan gymnasts."
