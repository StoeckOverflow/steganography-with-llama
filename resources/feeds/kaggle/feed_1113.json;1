        "The White House launched a rhetorical fusillade against its close ally and neighbor on Tuesday, accusing Canada of \u201crough\u201d trade practices that have hurt American workers and farmers. The invective \u2014 reinforced by U. S. announcements of sweeping tariffs on Canadian lumber imports \u2014 have few parallels in modern history and brought an immediate rebuke from the other side of the border, triggering fears of a trade war between two major economies.",
        "The lead Democrat and Republican on the House Oversight Committee meted out a rare bipartisan rebuke of former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn on Tuesday after seeing private information that confirmed the former administration official failed to disclose foreign income from Russia and Turkey. [Flynn did not initially reveal income from entities] The public criticism by the senior Republican on the House\u2019s chief investigative panel is unusual and presents a dilemma for the White House, which was accused of failing to provide everything the committee asked for \u2014 an assertion White House press secretary Sean Spicer disputed.",
        "TOKYO \u2014 As North Korea conducted drills Tuesday and South Korea, Japan and the United States carried out their own military exercises, the White House said there is still room for a diplomatic resolution. \u201cThe more that we can solve this diplomatically and continue to apply pressure on China and other countries to use the political and economic tools that they have to achieve a goal in stabilization in the region, but also to tamp down the threat that North Korea faces, I think that that is something that we all share,\u201d said White House press secretary Sean Spicer.",
        "Workers at a factory in China used by the company that makes clothing for Ivanka Trump\u2019s fashion line and other brands worked nearly 60 hours a week to earn wages of little more than $62 a week, according to a factory audit released Monday. The factory\u2019s 80 workers knit clothes for the contractor, Apparel Group, which has held the exclusive license to make the Ivanka Trump brand\u2019s $158 dresses, $79 blouses and other clothes since 2012. The company also makes clothes for Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and other brands.",
        "My husband does not eat dinner with our girls and me during the workweek. He stays at the office late, sometimes coming home when they\u2019re in bed. Every study I\u2019ve ever read on the topic explains the importance of family dinners, how eating together correlates with kids who are better adjusted and have higher grades, healthier eating habits and less of an inclination for drug addiction. So, like so many things these days, I wondered whether we were doing it all wrong.",
        "Turns out that cellphones are allowed in the grand courtroom of the Supreme Court \u2014 so long as the holder is a justice. The unmistakable sound of a cellphone ringing interrupted Tuesday morning\u2019s argument in Squibb Co. v. Superior Court of California, followed by a scramble on the part of Justice Stephen G. Breyer. The justice moved quickly to stop the sound, while some of his colleagues smiled and looked at the ceiling. Electronic devices are strictly forbidden in the courtroom, even for the lawyers who are arguing cases.",
        "Heather Martin, a. k. a. \u201cMommyOFive,\u201d is screaming. \u201cGet your f \u2014 \u2014 a \u2014 up here!\u201d she yells at Cody, her young son. Mike Martin \u2014 DaddyOFive to his family YouTube channel\u2019s 750, 000 subscribers \u2014 follows along behind with the camera as Cody runs upstairs. Soon, he is yelling, too: \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d There is ink all over the floor of Cody\u2019s room. The boy begins to cry. \u201cI didn\u2019t do that,\u201d he says, his face turning red. \u201cI swear to God I didn\u2019t do that.",
        "President Trump\u2019s call for a dramatic overhaul of the tax code sets in motion his most ambitious legislative initiative to date, testing whether he can cut the deal of his life on an issue that has long bedeviled Washington. On Wednesday, Trump issued a outline for changes to the tax code, pinpointing numerous changes he would make that would affect almost every American.",
        "At the center of President Trump\u2019s plan to dramatically cut taxes on businesses and individuals is a promise to stimulate extraordinary economic growth, so much so, his advisers say, that the plan will pay for itself. If he succeeds in keeping that promise, Trump will have accomplished something his Republican predecessors failed to do, according to economists and tax policy experts from both parties. In describing the proposal Wednesday, Trump\u2019s top economic advisers said the plan would unleash new investment and spending by American companies and consumers, supercharging economic growth.",
        "President Trump and his top national security advisers briefed congressional lawmakers Wednesday on what a senior aide called the \u201cvery grave threat\u201d posed by North Korea, but they offered few details about the administration\u2019s strategy to pressure Pyongyang. Administration officials emphasized in a pair of private briefings \u2014 one open to all senators and held at the White House complex, and one for House members on Capitol Hill \u2014 that they were developing a range of economic, diplomatic and military measures in the wake of a series of provocations from North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime.",
        "When Washington\u2019s signature social event kicks off this weekend, Wolf Blitzer will not be dining with Ashton Kutcher. Oscar winners will not clink cocktails along moonlit embassy balustrades. Distinguished political analysts will not tumble out of receptions with gift bags stuffed with luxury cosmetics and gourmet organic cookies. The stars of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d will not lean in for selfies with Chuck Schumer. A professional comedian will entertain, but his name might not ring a bell. And \u2014 perhaps you\u2019ve heard? \u2014 for the first time in 36 years, the president of the United States will not attend.",
        "An influential group of House conservatives threw its support behind a new Republican plan to revise the Affordable Care Act, shifting political pressure onto GOP moderates to determine the effort\u2019s fate. The House Freedom Caucus said the amendment negotiated by its chairman, Rep. Mark Meadows ( . C.) along with moderate Rep. Tom MacArthur ( . J.) would drive down costs by allowing states to opt out of certain rules under Obamacare.",
        "In the outpouring of commentary on President Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office, his greatest single achievement is almost never mentioned, which is itself a sign of what a major triumph it is: We are not talking much about whether Russia colluded with Trump\u2019s campaign to help elect him. Our distraction was not inevitable. Recall that just a little over a month ago, FBI Director James B. Comey told the House Intelligence Committee that the bureau was investigating possible cooperation between Trump\u2019s team and Russia\u2019s hacking and disinformation campaign to undercut Hillary Clinton.",
        "Douglas is president of the American Action Forum and former director of the Congressional Budget Office from 2003 to 2005. President Trump is correct to press for tax reform, correct to argue that corporate rates should be reduced and correct to look for policies that boost the United States\u2019 anemic economic growth rate. But the \u201crough draft\u201d of Trump\u2019s tax plan, rolled out at the White House on Wednesday, falls short of being a real tax reform suitable to conservatives such as me.",
        "The French are too intellectually vain to borrow others\u2019 political ideas but too interested in style not to appreciate and appropriate that of others. So, on May 7 they might confer their presidency on a Gallic Barack Obama. In 2008, Obama, a freshman senator, became a national Rorschach test, upon whom Americans projected their longings. Emmanuel Macron, 39, is a former Paris investment banker, untainted by electoral experience, and a virtuoso of vagueness.",
        "President Trump has set out to protect workers and businesses that make their living in the great American forest. But the immediate beneficiaries are probably going to be lawyers and lobbyists who inhabit the Washington swamp. In the latest iteration of the president\u2019s America First trade policy, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced Monday that he will seek a 20 percent import duty on imports from Canada, which are allegedly and, hence, unfair competition for U. S. products. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize Canada\u2019s been very rough on the United States. Everyone thinks of Canada as being wonderful, and so do I.",
        "I\u2019ve written a million columns critical of Donald Trump, give or take. This one is in praise. His campaign was a toxic stew of dog whistles to white nationalists and at times overt .",
        "NEWS OF the death of a man shot in Southeast Washington as he sat in his car near his son\u2019s school at 10:50 the morning of March 1 was easy to miss. \u201cOne of six shot on same street has died\u201d was the headline on the news brief about the death of Andrew McPhatter. That is how routine gun violence is in impoverished neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River. That should not be acceptable to any of us. A subsequent heartbreaking story about Mr. McPhatter\u2019s son brings that home.",
        "President Trump is considering notifying Canada and Mexico that he is starting the process to withdraw the United States from the three nations\u2019 North American Free Trade Agreement, three people familiar with the process said. Trump has not made a final decision, but if he were to sign the executive action notifying the two nations, it would begin a process to begin withdrawal. The notification would not require Trump to ultimately withdraw, but it is a required step if he plans to eventually exit the trade pact.",
        "Rep. Jeb Hensarling on Wednesday launched what is expected to be a protracted fight over easing banking regulations by pointing to who hasn\u2019t been supporting his effort: big Wall Street banks. His legislation, the Financial Choice Act, would ensure that banks could no longer rely on taxpayers for bailouts, he said. \u201cPerhaps that\u2019s why press reports indicate that most Wall Street banks oppose the Financial Choice Act,\u201d Hensarling ( .) said during a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee.",
        "After a rocky start, the House Intelligence Committee is plowing full steam ahead on its Russia probe with new leadership, a new witness list and new plans for hearings. Republicans and Democrats on the committee have agreed on a witness list that is dozens of names long and includes campaign and transition team surrogates of President Trump who volunteered to be interviewed, according to two panel Democrats. The volunteers who have come forward include former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, former campaign advisers Carter Page and Roger Stone, and former national security adviser Michael Flynn.",
        "President Trump signed an executive order Wednesday instructing Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to review any national monument created since Jan. 1, 1996, that spans at least 100, 000 acres in a move he said would \u201cend another egregious use of government power.",
        "Dealing with another legal blow that blocked another executive order this week, President Trump did something familiar. He attacked the judiciary. Again. And ever so aggressively. A White House statement Tuesday about a federal district judge\u2019s ruling on Trump\u2019s executive order on \u201csanctuary cities\u201d did not mince words. It emphasized \u2014 more than once \u2014 that the judge who just ruled against the administration is not an elected official.",
        "Annie Peguero was trying to soothe her agitated baby in church on Sunday when she did what she often does \u2014 she nursed her. But her efforts to calm her daughter caused a stir in the sanctuary of Summit Church in Springfield. A woman promptly asked the Dumfries mother to decamp to a private room, she said. Peguero declined and was later told that the church does not allow without a cover because it could make men, teenagers or new churchgoers \u201cuncomfortable,\u201d she said.",
        "\u201cIf the story\u2019s worth telling, I\u2019ll tell it. And, arguably, everybody\u2019s story is worth telling. \u201d That was Jonathan Demme speaking during an interview 10 years ago, as he prepared to be honored at the Charles Guggenheim Symposium at the Silverdocs film festival. As a nonfiction filmmaker every bit as attracted to Haitian culture and Middle East politics as music and spirituality, there\u2019s no doubt that Demme \u2014 who died Wednesday at the age of 73 \u2014 possessed the energy, curiosity and humanism befitting Guggenheim\u2019s legacy.",
        "In a message sent Wednesday to ESPN employees, network president John Skipper announced the company was beginning its next round of layoffs, a move that is expected to thin the ranks of ESPN\u2019s and online talent. [Journalists fire back at \u2018dirtbags reveling in ESPN\u2019s layoffs\u2019] \u201cA necessary component of managing change involves constantly evaluating how we best utilize all of our resources, and that sometimes involves difficult decisions,\u201d Skipper wrote.",
        "Ivanka Trump is the first first daughter in American history to score a West Wing office and hire a chief of staff. As her father\u2019s \u201cspecial adviser,\u201d her portfolio encompasses both outreach to Europe and rolling her eyes at dad jokes. In Berlin on Tuesday, she endured boos when she called the president a \u201cchampion\u201d for families during a panel discussion with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde and other female leaders But Ivanka is far from the first adult daughter to leave a mark on White House history.",
        "The name of the tiny town of indigenous Canadians, Attawapiskat, translates to \u201cpeople of the parting rocks. \u201d But in recent years, the name has become synonymous with its mountain of troubles. They were battered by a housing shortage peaking in 2011. Then they were dogged by a tax scandal, in which an audit found that millions in federal funds were unaccounted for. Recently, they were rocked by an epidemic of more than 100 suicide attempts that culminated in the declaration of a state of emergency last year.",
        "The Pentagon\u2019s top watchdog has launched an investigation into money that former national security adviser and retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn received from foreign groups and whether he failed to obtain proper approval to do so, lawmakers and defense officials said Thursday. The Pentagon has in the past advised retiring officers that because they can be recalled to military service, they are subject to the Constitution\u2019s rarely enforced emoluments clause, which prohibits top officials from receiving payments or favors from foreign governments. On Thursday, Rep. Elijah E.",
        "President Trump on Thursday railed against Democrats\u2019 spending demands and complained about threats of a government shutdown, even as GOP leaders in Congress neared a deal with Democrats to keep the lights on past Friday. In a series of tweets, Trump accused Democrats of threatening to close the government over a refusal to back spending increases for defense and border security despite indications that Democrats have already signed off on a GOP request for those funds."
