        "A federal judge\u2019s ruling this week that allows a predominantly white Alabama city to separate from its more diverse school district is stoking new debate about the fate of desegregation initiatives after decades of efforts to promote racial balance in public education. Judge Madeline Haikala of the U. S. District Court in Birmingham ruled that the city of Gardendale\u2019s effort to break away was motivated by race and sent messages of racial inferiority and exclusion that \u201cassail the dignity of black schoolchildren.",
        "ORLANDO \u2014 When Barack and Michelle Obama left the White House, they both spoke longingly of a break from life in the public eye. But following a vacation, they have started to tap into the lucrative circuit that has enriched so many other former presidents and first ladies \u2014 with the potential to quickly net millions of dollars. On Thursday, both made their first appearances as .",
        "As we cross the finish line of President Trump\u2019s first 100 days, no leader in recent memory has benefited more from low expectations. A more typical president who tumbled from an approval rating in the high 60s to one in the low 40s would be in a political crisis. Trump\u2019s current performance is only a slight dip from his divisive norm. A president with pretensions of rhetorical coherence would be embarrassed by gaffes and mediocre speeches. For Trump, gaffes and inarticulateness are part of the package.",
        "Sea change. An enormous one. That\u2019s the only way to understand President Trump\u2019s first 100 days \u2014 as a breaking from and often a breaking of the Obama presidency, one every bit as turbulent as what\u2019s encountered by a sailing ship going from calm seas into a hurricane. Trump\u2019s first 50 days were a jumble of ups and downs, mostly downs. But beginning with the flawless testimony of Neil M.",
        "\u201cI was one very lucky kid,\u201d wrote retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn in a 2016 memoir about his bumpy childhood in a Rhode Island family. \u201cI was one of those nasty tough kids, on breaking rules for the adrenaline rush and hardwired just enough to not care about the consequences,\u201d he wrote. Flynn described how he was arrested but given probation after \u201csome serious and unlawful activity. \u201d But he added: \u201cI would always retain my strong impulse to challenge authority and to think and act on my own whenever possible.",
        "Credit where credit is due: President Trump\u2019s tax plan is only one page long and yet contains volumes\u2019 worth of dumb ideas. And there\u2019s fierce competition for which part is dumbest. Maybe it\u2019s White House economic adviser Gary Cohn\u2019s peculiar claim that reducing the number of tax brackets is how you simplify the tax code. The complicated part of doing your taxes is figuring out what counts as income and what\u2019s deductible, not looking up the tax rate afterward in a table.",
        "Ronald A. Klain, a Post contributing columnist, served as a senior White House aide to Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton and was a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign. The milestone for a presidency is overblown: In what other endeavor is so much emphasis placed on the score just 7 percent of the way into a contest?",
        "ONE HUNDRED days into the Donald Trump presidency, we have neither achieved the nirvana he promised nor entered the dystopia critics, including us, feared. Since nirvana was never likely, it may be more productive to examine why we have, so far, avoided the worst. Preliminary thanks are owed to Congress, judges, the Congressional Budget Office, the American citizenry, and voters in the Netherlands and France. And, to a highly limited extent, to the president. He did not, on Day One, tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Iran nuclear treaty or the Paris climate change accord.",
        "The renewed push by House Republicans to pass legislation replacing parts of the Affordable Care Act might just be a game of political hot potato, with no one sure who will end up holding the object when the legislative music stops. A month ago, when Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) first pulled the bill from a planned vote, the blame fell squarely on the shoulders of the House Freedom Caucus, the group of almost three dozen conservatives who were largely opposed because Ryan\u2019s proposal did not go far enough to eliminate the Obama administration\u2019s landmark bill.",
        "Former U. S. attorney Alexander Acosta was confirmed as labor secretary Thursday, filling a key spot in President Trump\u2019s Cabinet and setting the stage for the administration to tackle pending rules that could have sweeping consequences for workers and retirement savers. The Senate voted to approve his nomination. The Cuban American from Miami will be the only Latino in Trump\u2019s Cabinet. His confirmation comes just as Trump is closing in on his first 100 days in office.",
        "On Thursday night, Arkansas plans to execute Kenneth Williams, who is on death row for killing a man named Cecil Boren in 1999. Williams already was serving a life sentence for killing Dominique Herd, an cheerleader, when he escaped from prison, killed Boren at his nearby home and stole his car, according to court records. Before Williams was arrested again, he fled from police in a chase that also killed Michael Greenwood, a truck driver. Greenwood was a father, with Kayla at home, and his wife, Stacey, pregnant with twin boys.",
        "Lawyers for David Dao, the Kentucky man who was violently removed from a flight for refusing to give up his seat earlier this month, said Thursday that they have reached a confidential settlement with United Airlines. The agreement comes on the same day that United released the results of an internal investigation that found several mistakes were made before, during and after Dao was dragged off the April 9 flight, including calling in law enforcement to resolve an incident that was neither a safety nor security issue.",
        "SEOUL \u2014 A North Korean propaganda outlet released a video clip on Thursday showing simulated attacks on the United States and declaring that \u201cthe enemy to be destroyed is in our sights. \u201d The video comes at a particularly tense time in relations between North Korea and the United States, with the Trump administration sending warships to the region in a show of force against Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime.

        "ISTANBUL \u201d A Russian naval intelligence ship sank Thursday after colliding with a merchant freighter in foggy conditions on the Black Sea near Istanbul, the Turkish coast guard said. All 78 crew members on the Russian vessel were rescued. The crew of the freighter Youzarsif H, a ship traveling from Romania to Jordan with a cargo of 8, 800 sheep, was unharmed, and the ship suffered slight damage to its bow, according to local media reports.",
        "Many influences have conspired to transform the look of luxury fashion from jackets and brocade dresses into an aesthetic that is less formal, far grittier and rich with imperfections and ambiguities. The rise of athleticism has meant that track pants and hoodies are now part of the aesthetic vocabulary at brands such as Gucci, Givenchy and Chanel. Gym basics are as legitimate a source of inspiration for designers as a classical painting or an film.",

        "About half of the 675 immigrants picked up in roundups across the United States in the days after President Trump took office either had no criminal convictions or had committed traffic offenses, mostly drunken driving, as their most serious crimes, according to data obtained by The Washington Post. Records provided by congressional aides Friday offered the most detailed look yet at the backgrounds of the individuals rounded up and targeted for deportation in early February by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents assigned to regional offices in Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, San Antonio and New York.",
        "STERLING HEIGHTS, MICH. \u2014 The charter flight left on a Wednesday with eight Iraqis on board. By the following evening, the large Iraqi immigrant community in this Detroit suburb was roiled with rumors about why, with news of the departure morphing as phone calls spun into horror. Some people were talking again about whether they should go into hiding. The flight on April 19, it turns out, was the result of a Trump administration policy that could lead to the deportation of thousands of Iraqis back to a country many haven\u2019t seen in decades.",
        "President Trump came into office promising to make the economy grow at rates the United States hasn\u2019t seen for decades. On Friday, as the government reported that the U. S. economy expanded in the first quarter at its slowest pace in three years, he got a glimpse of just how far he has to go. In the first official growth estimates of Trump\u2019s presidency, federal economists reported gross domestic product, a broad measure of economic growth, grew at an annualized rate of just 0. 7 percent in the year\u2019s first quarter, down from 2.",
        "Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and most of his government were miles away from Mexico City on Wednesday, sitting on a grandstand under the hot midday sun, watching an aviation demonstration at a military base, when the news started to filter through. In cellphone messages and traded remarks, they learned that President Trump planned within days to sign an order triggering U. S. withdrawal from NAFTA, the trilateral agreement that has regulated trade in North America for decades. At about the same time in Washington, Canadian Ambassador David MacNaughton was learning the same thing.",
        "TOKYO \u2014 North Korea fired another ballistic missile early Saturday morning, but it exploded within seconds of being launched, American and South Korean defense officials said. Coinciding with renewed diplomatic and military pressure on North Korea from the Trump administration, this latest launch underscores both Kim Jong Un\u2019s determination to make technical progress on his weapons programs and his defiance amid international pressure. President Trump, who was briefed on the launch soon afterward, took to Twitter to reiterate his expectation that Chinese President Xi Jinping use his leverage to make Kim stop.",
        "UNITED NATIONS \u2014 Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called Friday for new economic sanctions on North Korea and other \u201cpainful\u201d measures over its nuclear weapons program, as the Trump administration warned that it would take military action if diplomacy failed. \u201cFailing to act now on the most pressing security issue in the world may bring catastrophic consequences,\u201d Tillerson said during an unusual session of the U. N. Security Council called to review what the Trump administration calls its most dire national security concern. \u201cThe more we bide our time, the sooner we will run out of it.",
        "Donald Trump couldn\u2019t be more relieved than this columnist for the end of the blasted first 100 days. One more quantitative analysis of his (lack of) accomplishments or his (mis) deeds during this period would have put at risk the sanity of the Western world. It\u2019s over, done, finis \u2014 thanks be to whatever deity gets you through the night \u2014 and now we can relax into a possibly \u201cmajor, major conflict with North Korea,\u201d as suggested by the president during a recent Reuters interview. Whew. But seriously.",
        "In collecting $400, 000 from a Wall Street investment firm to make a single speech, Barack Obama is following in the footsteps of past presidents. Ronald Reagan landed a $2 million speaking gig in Japan. George W. Bush, on his way out, announced it was time to \u201creplenish the ol\u2019 coffers. \u201d Bill and Hillary Clinton reported making more than $235 million after leaving the White House. But to acknowledge that Obama has plenty of precedent on his side is not to say that his choice is wise. Indeed, it\u2019s unfortunate.",

        "Here\u2019s one genuine achievement of the Trump administration\u2019s first 100 days: The president, it seems, has come to realize he is in over his head. \u201cThis is more work than in my previous life. I thought it would be easier,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview this week. \u201cI do miss my old life. I like to work so that\u2019s not a problem, but this is actually more work. \u201d I can empathize. Having Donald Trump as president has been hard on all of us.",
        "France sees itself as playing a unique role in the world as a \u201cbeacon for humanity,\u201d as former president Jacques Chirac put it. Yet, that role is not always one it finds easy to fulfill. France\u2019s past and present reveal a complex saga of aspirations and disappointed hopes, from the revolution of 1789 to the present morosit\u00e9 (a despairing, very French species of gloom) gripping the land that gave the world la joie de vivre. These contradictions may help explain the persistent myths surrounding the nation and people of France, among them these five. Myth No.",
        "PRESIDENT TRUMP\u2019S moods about trade continue to swing. He went out of his way to bash the deal between the United States and South Korea, irritating that ally at precisely the same time he needs Seoul\u2019s cooperation against North Korea. On the other hand, Mr. Trump decided not to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, partly because the leaders of Canada and Mexico asked him politely not to, and partly because, as he put it, such an announcement would have been a \u201cpretty big, you know, shock to the system. \u201d Instead of shredding the pact, Mr.",
        "Donald Trump spent a great portion of 2016 insisting that being president would be easy \u2014 at least for him. HuffPost compiled a number of examples of him dismissing the problems that accompany the job as being easily dispatched. Building a wall on the border with Mexico is easy. Beating Hillary Clinton would be easy. Renegotiating the Iran deal would be easy. Paying down the national debt would be easy. Acting presidential? Easy. To a reporter from Reuters this week, though, Trump had a slightly different assessment of the presidency. \u201cI love my previous life."
