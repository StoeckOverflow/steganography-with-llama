        "Congress voted overwhelmingly Friday to keep federal agencies open for another week, defying President Trump\u2019s desire for action on both a border wall and overhauling the system by concentrating on what lawmakers viewed as the greater priority \u2014 avoiding a government shutdown. But the sense of accomplishment may be . With several unresolved differences remaining in the ongoing bipartisan negotiations over spending, lawmakers planned to work through the weekend to finalize a deal that would fund the government through the end of the fiscal year in September.",
        "ATLANTA \u2014 On the eve of his 100th day in office, President Trump made a triumphant return before members of the National Rifle Association, promising a group that was one of his earliest and most enthusiastic supporters that he will \u201cnever infringe on the right of the people to bear arms. \u201d \u201cFreedom is not a gift from government, freedom is a gift from God,\u201d Trump said.",
        "A federal court on Friday granted the Trump administration\u2019s request to suspend lawsuits against the Clean Power Plan rule, signaling the likely end of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature climate policy. The order from the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia stays litigation against the Environmental Protection Agency rule for 60 days. It does not indicate whether the D. C. Circuit will return the rule to the agency, although the EPA did not ask for it to do so. Instead, the order asks for guidance on whether to send the regulation back altogether.",
        "President Trump\u2019s long history of stretching the truth and speaking hyperbolically has hurt his credibility with the American public. But in court, he\u2019s had the opposite problem. Judges are taking him at his word. In temporarily striking down Trump\u2019s order threatening to strip funding from \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d a federal judge this week in San Francisco used the president\u2019s own comments against him. That in itself was not unusual since judges had done the same thing in blocking Trump\u2019s travel ban.",

        "The U. S. military has launched an investigation into the deaths of two elite Army Rangers in Afghanistan early Thursday, saying they may have been killed by friendly fire during a battle with Islamic State militants. Sgt. Joshua P. Rodgers, 22, and Sgt. Cameron H. Thomas, 23, died during a large nighttime raid in Nangarhar province, the Pentagon said Friday. They were members of the Army\u2019s 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, a Special Operations force that specializes in raids. U.

        "A rising number of young men who were kicked out of college for sexual misconduct are suing those schools, alleging they were treated unfairly as their cases were investigated and decided, legal data show. Many are securing settlements that clear the discipline from their record, lawyers and advocacy groups say. Some even are being allowed to return to campus.",

        "After 100 days full of fits and starts, President Trump is barreling into the second phase of his presidency focused on attempting to secure big victories that have eluded him on the economic pillars of his agenda. With an eye toward keeping his core promise of creating jobs and ramping up economic growth, Trump has fixated on tax reform as the next undertaking of his administration \u2014 an opportunity for him to land a first major legislative victory after repeated failures to pass a package.",
        "As President Trump passes the mark of his administration, House Republicans should be starting to worry about next year\u2019s midterm elections. The midterms are a referendum on the presidency, and preliminary signs point to problems for the party in power unless things change. Trump\u2019s approval ratings, which started low, haven\u2019t budged. He\u2019s in negative territory, with an approval rating of just 43 percent and a disapproval rating of 52 percent, according to the RealClearPolitics average. That\u2019s a zone of negativity that, if history holds, could put the GOP\u2019s current House majority in jeopardy in 2018.",
        "President Trump marked his 100th day in office with an event touting what he called his administration\u2019s \u201chistoric progress,\u201d even as his prime focus early in the campaign rally focused on his antagonism with the news media. Trump wasted no time mentioning the \u201cbig gathering\u201d in Washington \u2014 the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner, which he declined to attend \u2014 eliciting boos from the crowd in Harrisburg, Pa. as he dismissed the event as \u201ca large group of Hollywood actors and Washington media\u201d who he said were \u201cconsoling each other in a hotel ballroom.",
        "VIRGINIA BEACH \u2014 The room was full of strangers, but they had a common purpose. The retired pastors who cut their teeth on the civil rights movement. The sociology professor from a local college. The grandmother of three who showed up despite having recently suffered a stroke. \u201cWe know the Democratic majority can win if we get people to the polls,\u201d said a woman standing in front. \u201cThere\u2019s a great number of Republicans who are sick to their stomachs as well,\u201d said a retired consultant. \u201cDon\u2019t discount them.",
        "President Trump has suggested that the judiciary doesn\u2019t have the authority to question him. He was a very early proponent of nuking the filibuster for Supreme Court Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. And he recently raised eyebrows by congratulating Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the expansion of his presidential powers \u2014 echoing his previous admiration for strongman leaders. Now Trump is talking about consolidating his own power.",
        "On a sweltering April day, tens of thousands of demonstrators assembled in Washington on Saturday for the latest installment of the regular protests that punctuate the Trump era. This climate march marked President Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office, which have already seen multiple rollbacks of environmental protections and Obama climate policies. The Peoples Climate March, which originated with a massive demonstration in New York in September 2014, picked a symbolically striking day for its 2017 event. The temperature reached 91 degrees at D. C.\u2019s National Airport at 2:59 p. m.",
        "Samantha Bee\u2019s live \u201cFull Frontal\u201d event in Washington certainly was no White House correspondents\u2019 dinner. There was no president, at least a sitting one, and there wasn\u2019t really dinner (hors d\u2019oeuvres, mostly). But that\u2019s what she promised with her \u201cNot the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner,\u201d which taped hours before Saturday\u2019s formal event across town and will air on TBS tonight at 10 p. m. As attendees dressed in formal wear waited in the sweltering heat to get inside of DAR Constitution Hall, protesters were marching just blocks away on a parade to the White House.",
        "Welcome to White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner night. This year, it\u2019s going to be different. That\u2019s largely because President Trump declined to attend \u2014 and declared that his White House aides would also stay home. Usually, a speech by the is a highlight of the evening, which helped make the dinner an draw over the decades. But even before Trump sent his regrets, it was clear that folks from Hollywood \u2014 a community that has been vocally opposed to the president \u2014 were not interested in coming to Washington this year.",
        "Remember way back in 2016, when the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner was synonymous with the obnoxious selfies jamming your feeds? Yeah, the 2017 dinner (and its surrounding weekend) a industry affair that somehow got glitzy and then in one election cycle lost nearly all its sheen, is definitely not that. Yes, there are still plenty of parties happening this weekend, but instead of gift bags and humble brags, now you get a lecture. Case in point: Voto Latino\u2019s reliably (but with Rosario Dawson!",
        "Donald J. Trump is the president of the United States. One hundred days ago, I took the oath of office and made a pledge: We are not merely going to transfer political power from one party to another, but instead are going to transfer that power from Washington, D. C. and give it back to the people. In the past 100 days, I have kept that promise \u2014 and more. Issue by issue, department by department, we are giving the people their country back.",
        "Tracy Grant is a deputy managing editor of The Washington Post. Several months ago, I found myself climbing the rickety stairs of a commercial building to a dank, windowless office, where I waited with two other white women whose cars, like mine, had been unceremoniously towed earlier that afternoon. Sitting behind the desk was a clearly flustered African American woman in her late 20s. Even seated, she was statuesque, with cornrows wrapped in a neat scarf. But her hands shook as she took $120 from each of us in exchange for the return of our vehicles.",
        "When President Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in February, stepping into the fray of the conflict, he expressed his opinion on the or solution by saying, \u201cI can live with either one. \u201d Trump will meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas this coming week. One item that ought to be on the agenda is a scarcely known feature of civic life in the West Bank: monthly salaries and payments to terrorists.",

        "You\u2019ve heard the stories of the coat hanger and the back alley, those bloody days before Roe v. Wade. Sen. Patrick J. Leahy told one recently at the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Judge Neil M. Gorsuch. As a Vermont prosecutor in 1968, three years before the court struck down state abortion bans, cops woke Leahy up in the middle of the night, because \u201ca young nearly died from bleeding from a botched abortion.",
        "Pity the leaders of U. S. allies. They must please two very different audiences: Donald Trump, the president of the global superpower, and their own publics, who largely detest that man. (A poll conducted in 45 countries during the presidential campaign found that, in every single U. S. ally, the public favored Hillary Clinton over Trump.) Kowtow to Trump, and while you may spare your country an angry tweet or a new tariff, you risk domestic disapproval for refusing to echo your voters\u2019 contempt. Stand up to him, and you could damage your country\u2019s most important bilateral relationship.",
        "ATLANTA \u2014 Among the tens of thousands of people who took part in the National Rifle Association convention here, women were an obvious minority. The thing that seemed to unite them was an overwhelming enthusiasm for President Trump. \u201cLook at what he\u2019s putting his family through for us,\u201d said Anne Jansen, an artist selling jewelry handcrafted out of bullet casings and shotgun shells. \u201cIt\u2019s for us.

        "JOHANNESBURG \u2014 She was the eldest grandchild of Nelson Mandela, and that meant politics were woven into her life. As a child, it meant visiting her grandfather in prison as he served time for fighting apartheid. Later, it meant celebrating in the presidential office as the racist system fell. And always, it meant that Ndileka Mandela was an exalted member of the African National Congress (ANC) the organization led by her grandfather. More than a party, it had long been synonymous with the black majority\u2019s struggle for justice under white rule \u2014 and with Mandela himself.",

Ch\u00e1vez, a master showman who promised his country a socialist \u201crevolution,\u201d loved to wade through crowds of poor Venezuelans, blowing kisses and dispensing hugs. But when his successor has ventured out in public in recent months, he\u2019s been pelted with eggs and chased by angry mobs. \u201cMaduro is so different,\u201d said Irene Castillo, 26, who lives in El Guarataro, a tough neighborhood not far from the presidential palace.",
        "For Royce Young, writing their story was not only a way to work through it, he said, but also a way to remember it. Nearly five months ago, Young and his wife, Keri, found out that their unborn daughter had a rare birth defect called anencephaly, a condition in which the baby does not develop a vital part of the brain or top of the skull. If their daughter was born, she would die all too soon. If the pregnancy were terminated, she would not live at all."
