        "Copper pots hang on a rack over a large kitchen island, where the man in the chef\u2019s jacket has started painting white plates with crimson streaks of reduced beet juice, one component of the evening\u2019s salad course. Farther down the marble island, the is already set to go: Eggshells, their tops expertly removed, are filled with an egg custard crowned with poached lobster meat. He moves through his kitchen with a casual grace, offering a glass of 2002 Krug champagne to his guests while returning, time and again, to focus on his plates.",
        "Three teams sat on a wood floor with a pile of Legos. Every few minutes, a member from each group would race over to a completed structure resting on a chair. They had 15 seconds to memorize the design before returning to their teammates with instructions. The purpose of the exercise was to see how well the participants could replicate the model using the tenets of teamwork: communication and collaboration. After several relays, buildings slowly started to take shape, as did the personalities of the participants. There were commanders and soldiers, creative thinkers and slow tinkerers.",
        "Yoga is not all about flawless handstands, sweaty selfies and perfect crow poses at sunset, despite what your Instagram feed may suggest. The ugly truth is that it takes hard work, time and patience, not to mention strength and flexibility. Jessamyn Stanley, a yoga fan turned social media fitness star, is breathing proof of it.",
        "In many ways, President Trump\u2019s attempts to implement his immigration policies have not gone very well in his first three months. His travel ban aimed at some countries has been blocked by the courts, his U. S. border wall has gone nowhere in Congress, and he has retreated, at least for now, on his vow to target illegal immigrants brought here as children. But one strategy that seems to be working well is fear.",
        "President Trump tried Sunday to reassure anxious Republicans that the latest proposal to replace the Affordable Care Act would continue to protect those with preexisting medical conditions, although he struggled to fully articulate what form those protections would take. As Republicans have tried to find a bill on which they can reach a consensus, Speaker Paul D.",
        "Reviving a controversial theme that President Trump brought up on the campaign trail, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said Sunday that the administration has \u201clooked at\u201d potential changes to libel laws that would make it easier for Trump to sue news organizations that criticize him. \u201cI think it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve looked at,\u201d Priebus told Jonathan Karl on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week. \u201d \u201cHow that gets executed or whether that goes anywhere is a different story,\u201d he added.",
        "The northernmost village in Greenland sits just shy of 78 degrees north latitude \u201d deep in the Arctic \u201d yet during the summer, meltwater is everywhere. It flows in small rivulets and larger streams, past multicolored houses built against a sloping hill and down to the Inglefield Bredning, as it is called in Danish \u201d a broad body of water at the confluence of several fjords.",
        "Growing up in the 1980s, Brian Brown was taught to think of the communist Soviet Union as a dark and evil place. But Brown, a leading activist, said that in the past few years he has started meeting Russians at conferences on family issues and finding many kindred spirits. Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, has visited Moscow four times in four years, including a 2013 trip during which he testified before the Duma as Russia adopted a series of laws.",
        "Tests last summer showed troubling levels of lead in the water at Summit Township Elementary School, perched on a quiet hilltop outside Butler, Pa. But for the next five months, no one told the parents of Summit\u2019s 250 students. When officials alerted families to the potential lead contamination in January, the dominoes fell quickly. The district superintendent and assistant superintendent resigned. The school board hired an independent investigator. Administrators shuttered Summit and moved students to another building several miles away.",
        "DUNWOODY, Ga. \u2014 With President Trump\u2019s approval ratings at historic lows, some Republican congressional candidates fear that embracing him will incur the wrath of moderate voters and doom their campaigns. Not Karen Handel. The Republican candidate for the House seat vacated by Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price is racing to align herself with Trump ahead of a June 20 runoff, hoping his supporters will help her beat back the wave of sentiment that almost delivered an upset victory to Democrat Jon Ossoff in this nationally watched contest.",
        "His voters sent him to Washington to break stuff, and this weekend Donald Trump tried to break the annual dinner of the White House Correspondents  Association. As with some of his business ventures, he was not wholly successful.",
        "James Brousse plans to spend a good chunk of the next few weeks \u201cprotecting\u201d New Orleans\u2019s Confederate monuments from impending demolition, and the has a message for police who will try to keep the peace: You can leave the snipers at home. Brousse, the commander of the local chapter of Sons of Confederate Veterans, is part of a group of about a dozen people who have stood vigil for the past week at three monuments honoring the Confederacy \u2014 landmarks that city leaders say are mostly out of touch with how most residents see their city.",
        "The New York Times thought it was bringing a fresh voice and some ideological diversity to its influential pages when it hired conservative columnist Bret Stephens from the Wall Street Journal two weeks ago. Readers weren\u2019t impressed by Stephens\u2019s debut column, to say the least. The outrage flowed freely after Stephens challenged the certitude about climate science in his first piece for the newspaper on Friday. While acknowledging that the planet has warmed over the past century and that humans have contributed to it, he wrote, \u201cmuch else that passes as accepted fact is really a matter of probabilities.",
        "President Trump did not appear to be ruling out military action against North Korea if the country pushes forward with its nuclear weapons program. In an interview with CBS News\u2019s John Dickerson that aired Sunday on \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Trump said he would not be pleased if North Korea takes that step. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to do what he has to do. But he understands we\u2019re not going to be very happy,\u201d Trump said of the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong Un.",
        "\u201cDear White People\u201d was met with critical acclaim when it hit theaters in 2014. Director and writer Justin Simien\u2019s satire, which followed a group of black students at a predominantly white Ivy League university, rejected the notion that we live in a society. Three years later, the idea of a society isn\u2019t one that needs to be disproved. We\u2019ve gotten the message \u2014 through the incessant churn of social media, our news cycle and the efforts of activists calling on a generation to wake up (or in more current parlance, \u201cstay woke\u201d).",
        "VANCOUVER \u2014 Want to live longer, enjoy life more and actually find that elusive happiness? Among the dozens of big ideas shared this week at the international TED conference \u2014 from a robot that could outperform students on college exams to an ultraviolet light that could kill superbugs \u2014 were some simpler, almost obvious, life improvements we should all prioritize to live better lives.",
        "When President Trump announced his hotline for victims of immigration crimes to a joint session of Congress, he got loud boos and groans from the assembled elected officials, worried about painting immigrants broadly as violent criminals. But watching from home, Alexander McCoy saw an opportunity for a monumental Twitter prank and a subtle act of civil disobedience. It was based, he told The Washington Post, on his seething anger at how Trump thinks of immigrants \u2014 and a pun.",
        "Americans hate to haggle. Maybe that\u2019s because, unlike in other cultures, we don\u2019t do it very often, so we haven\u2019t gotten very good at it. I\u2019m here to tell you that it\u2019s worth it to learn, given that the two things we do have to negotiate for are the most expensive things we buy: our homes and our cars. In fact, auto website Edmunds. com says skilled negotiators can save as much as 15 percent when they purchase a vehicle.",
        "My middle son loves to whip up huge weekend breakfasts. He and his dad have perfected the egg sandwich, the egg in a hole and bursting breakfast burritos, and my son is often found making pancakes for his sister. As perfect as his egg sandwich might be, his pancakes don\u2019t always gratify; oftentimes they are burned on one side, others turn out too dense, and frankly some of his ingredient combinations just taste better than others.",
        "Now that the dust has almost settled from United Airlines\u2019 infamous incident, travelers are left with several important and largely unanswered questions about how this kerfuffle will change air travel \u2014 if it does at all. In case you missed it, United has been under fire for calling law enforcement to have a passenger, David Dao, forcibly removed from a flight from Chicago to Louisville earlier this month. The ejection, captured on video and widely shared on social media, caused an uproar and triggered a round of airline industry \u2014 and \u2014 that has continued.",
        "The aim has become very simple for House Republicans stumbling closer to passing a bill to revise the Affordable Care Act: just get it off their plates and over to the Senate.",
        "The turmoil at Fox News continued on Monday with the ouster of Bill Shine, who succeeded Roger Ailes amid a scandal last summer despite Shine\u2019s alleged role in abetting Ailes in tolerating a workplace hostile to women. Shine, a Fox News veteran, appeared to have the backing of Fox chairman Rupert Murdoch in the wake of the firing of Bill O\u2019Reilly, Fox\u2019s biggest star. Only last week, Murdoch, Shine and Fox Jack Abernethy were photographed emerging from lunch at a Manhattan restaurant, a tableau widely read as a vote of confidence by Murdoch in the two men.",
        "The overflow crowd at Busboys and Poets was black and white and shades in between, yuppies in chinos and activists in message bubbling with excitement to hear from the special guest at the restaurant\u2019s open mic night. Instead of a poet or a musician, Rep. Maxine Waters ( .) stepped onto the stage, showered with applause and cheers. Not many members of Congress could draw this kind of crowd \u2014 diverse and yet united behind a single goal. After taking a moment to thank the crowd for its greeting, Waters got right to the point.",
        "Why couldn\u2019t we all just get along? That\u2019s what President Trump wants to know about the Civil War. In an interview with the Washington Examiner\u2019s Salena Zito, our posits that the war might not have happened if only Andrew Jackson had still been around. The whole thing apparently could have been avoided if only we had a bona fide negotiator \u2014 someone more up to the task than Low Energy Abe Lincoln. Here\u2019s the exchange, via Sirius XM\u2019s P. O. T. U. S.: TRUMP: [Jackson] was a swashbuckler.",
        "This story has been updated to reflect President Trump\u2019s speculation that Andrew Jackson could have prevented the Civil War. \u201cStop the Runaway,\u201d Andrew Jackson urged in an ad placed in the Tennessee Gazette in October 1804. The future president gave a detailed description: A \u201cMulatto Man Slave, about thirty years old, six feet and an inch high, stout made and active, talks sensible, stoops in his walk, and has a remarkable large foot, broad across the root of the toes \u2014 will pass for a free man.",
        "The greatest achievement of Donald Trump\u2019s first 100 days as president was that there was a 101st. If things continue this way, he will finish out his term and then the nation, like someone after a boozy night, can right itself and get on with its business. We will restore the environment, repair alliances, recognize science, welcome immigrants, cherish honesty, value knowledge and return dignity to a White House where Jefferson may have dined alone but where Trump was joined by Sarah Palin. More than a fresh coat of paint is needed.",
        "For those who claim that Donald Trump has been pasteurized and homogenized by the presidency, his sour, speech in Harrisburg, Pa. was inconvenient. Trump used his high office to pursue divisive grudges (Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer is a \u201cbad leader\u201d) to attack the media (composed of \u201cincompetent, dishonest people\u201d) and to savage congressional Democrats (\u201cthey don\u2019t mind drugs pouring in\u201d). Most of all, Trump used his bully pulpit quite literally, devoting about half his speech to the dehumanization of migrants and refugees as criminals, infiltrators and terrorists.",
        "President Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office were mostly about empty noise. The next 100 likely will be the same. There is no principle at the heart of Trump\u2019s policies. In many cases, there are no policies at all, just improvised attempts to bridge the gap between Trump\u2019s rhetoric and inconvenient reality. This is no way to run a corner bodega, let alone the greatest nation on Earth. What kind of president calls North Korean leader Kim Jong Un a \u201cpretty smart cookie,\u201d as Trump did in an interview broadcast Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d?",
        "Let\u2019s face it: The past 100 days have been a disaster . . . for Democrats. While much ink has been spilled in the past week assessing President Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office, the Democrats\u2019 abysmal performance has largely escaped scrutiny. So let\u2019s review their record. The Democrats spent much of Trump\u2019s first months in office pushing their unfounded narrative of Trump\u2019s alleged collusion with Vladimir Putin. But that narrative went up in smoke when Trump launched missile strikes against Putin\u2019s Syrian ally, Bashar .",
        "The New York Times reports that President Trump\u2019s aides were \u201cstunned\u201d that he invited Philippine strongman Rodrigo Duterte to the White House. I\u2019m stunned that anybody would be stunned. In style, if not in scope, the two men are brothers from another mother. Both have employed foul language in public, boasted publicly about their sexual performance and made vulgar references to assaulting women. Both have threatened the free press, challenged the legitimacy of the judiciary, attacked opponents as corrupt \u2014 and insulted the pope."
