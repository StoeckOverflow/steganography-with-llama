        "PHILIPPINE PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte poses a difficult challenge for the United States. He is the democratically elected leader of a American ally whose strategic cooperation is important in checking China\u2019s aggressive expansionism in the South China Sea. But he is also the author of a heinous campaign of extrajudicial killings of suspected drug traffickers and users that has led to more than 7, 000 deaths since he took office last June. While a rupture with his government is not in the U. S. interest, tolerating his abuses threatens grievous damage to America\u2019s moral standing in Asia and beyond.",
        "One person was killed and three others wounded during an attack on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin on Monday afternoon, authorities said. Jennifer Herber, a spokeswoman for the Austin Police Department, said a suspect is in custody. The university canceled classes and scheduled events for the rest of the day. At a news conference Monday afternoon, University of Texas Police Chief David Carter identified the suspect in custody as Kendrex J. White, who he said also appears to be a student at the university.",
        "President Trump said Monday he would be \u201chonored\u201d to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \u201cunder the right circumstances. \u201d Trump\u2019s comments came amid heightened tensions with North Korea, whose nuclear weapons program has sparked deep concerns in the international community, and just a day after Trump said he would not rule out military action against North Korea. [Trump is not ruling out military action against North Korea] \u201cIf it would be appropriate for me to meet with him, I would absolutely, I would be honored to do it,\u201d Trump told Bloomberg News in a Monday interview.",
        "A prominent militant who fought with separatists in Ukraine and participated in European politics recently completed U. S. Army training and is serving in an American infantry division in Hawaii, according to Army and other records. Guillaume Cuvelier, 29, shipped for basic training in January and graduated as an infantryman at Fort Benning, Ga. the records show. In a short exchange with The Washington Post, Cuvelier confirmed that he was actively serving in the U. S. Army. With his history of espousing extreme views and his role in an armed group backed by a U. S.",
        "After only six days on the job, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue moved to stall one of former first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s signature accomplishments: stricter nutritional standards for school breakfasts and lunches, which feed more than 31 million children. Speaking at Catoctin Elementary School in Leesburg, Va. on Monday with Sen. Pat Roberts ( .) and Patricia Montague of the School Nutrition Association, Perdue announced that his department would be slowing the implementation of aggressive standards on sodium, whole grains and sweetened milks that passed under the Obama administration.",
        "Speaking at an conference of elites in government and finance Monday morning, President Trump\u2019s treasury secretary took credit for rising prices in bank stocks. \u201dYou should all thank me for your bank stocks doing better,\u201d the secretary, Steven T. Mnuchin, told a Beverly Hills audience at the annual conference of the Milken Institute, an economic research group. Since the election, a Standard and Poor\u2019s index of shares in major financial institutions is up 18. 6 percent. President Trump has pledged to undo the rules and regulations that Democrats imposed on Wall Street in the financial reform legislation of 2010.",
        "Police have retracted earlier accounts that a vehicle was reversing toward officers in an \u201caggressive manner\u201d when one of the officers opened fire, striking and killing Jordan Edwards in a suburb Saturday night. In a news conference Monday, Balch Springs Police Chief Jonathan Haber said that he initially \u201cmisspoke\u201d and that the vehicle had begun to drive away at the time the officer opened fire. He questioned whether the shooting was necessary.",
        "President Trump on Monday said he was open to raising the federal tax on gasoline and using the new revenue for his infrastructure package, a potentially major policy change as his top advisers try to assemble a plan to finance $1 trillion in new projects. Trump, in an interview with Bloomberg News, said he was open to raising the tax, though he was not committed to pursuing it. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I would certainly consider,\u201d Bloomberg quoted Trump as saying. The president added that he would be inclined to back the idea \u201cif we earmarked money toward the highways.",
        "Police say a gunman who opened fire at a pool party in San Diego on Sunday evening, killing one person and wounding six others, was \u201cdespondent\u201d over a recent breakup. Before the attacker was killed exchanging gunfire with police officers, he called his on the phone and made her \u201clisten in as he carried out his rampage,\u201d according to San Diego Police Chief Shelley Zimmerman.",
        "ISTANBUL \u2014 Workers and activists marked May Day on Monday with defiant rallies and marches for better pay and working conditions. Some countries celebrate International Workers\u2019 Day with a public holiday, though others restrict activities, which can lead to confrontations. Some of the events around the world: TURKEY: Police in Istanbul detained more than 70 people who tried to march to iconic Taksim Square in defiance of a ban on holding May Day events there.",
        "One hundred days in, TV\u2019s Trump humor has hit a wall. How could it not? The material is so bountiful, the comedic workload so relentless, and daily occurrences so absurd as to blur into a meaningless and easily lampooned travesty of leadership. The audience can write and perform the material as easily (and as quickly) as the pros.",
        "The Justice Department has decided not to bring charges against the officers involved in the death of Alton Sterling, whose videotaped shooting by police in Baton Rouge last summer prompted unrest across the city, and is planning to reveal in the next 24 hours that it has closed the probe, according to four people familiar with the matter. As of Tuesday afternoon, the Sterling family had yet to be informed by the Justice Department of the decision, and it is unclear how and when the department will announce its findings.",
        "A suburban Dallas police chief acknowledged Monday that an officer who fatally shot a black in a moving vehicle fired as the car was driving away \u2014 not as it reversed toward officers, as the department had previously asserted. Balch Springs Police Chief Jonathan Haber told reporters that police video contradicted his department\u2019s original statement about the Saturday night shooting of Jordan Edwards. Edwards, a high school freshman, had gotten into a vehicle with four other teenagers to leave a house party as police were arriving to investigate an underage drinking complaint, according to his family\u2019s attorney, Lee Merritt.",
        "President Trump on Tuesday called for a government shutdown later this year and suggested the Senate might need to prohibit future filibusters, threatening to fracture Washington\u2019s basic underpinnings to make progress on his legislative goals. His latest outbursts \u2014 no sitting president has called for the government to be shut down like this \u2014 could cast a shadow over how Congress approaches numerous bills this year. Trump wants Congress to overhaul the tax code, approve a $1 trillion infrastructure package and raise or suspend the debt ceiling before the government begins falling behind on its obligations.",
        "Republican efforts to overhaul the nation\u2019s system collided Tuesday with fierce resistance about how it would affect people with preexisting medical conditions, casting the proposal\u2019s future into deeper uncertainty as GOP leaders scrambled to try to salvage it. On Capitol Hill, influential Rep. Fred Upton ( .) came out against the plan, dealing a major blow to proponents trying to secure enough votes to pass it in the House. Across the country, host Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s emotional story about his newborn son\u2019s heart condition reverberated on television and the Internet.",
        "BIG SANDY, Mont. \u2014 When Sen. Jon Tester was 9 years old, he had a job: take meat from cows slaughtered on his family\u2019s farm and feed it into the steel maw of a meat grinder. The motor took it from there, pushing the beef through four spinning blades and then squeezing it, like toothpaste, out a series of small holes. It was a powerful, dangerous machine, something Tester learned the hard way the day it sliced off three of his fingers. He doesn\u2019t remember his left hand slipping in, but remembers pulling it out.",
        "Investors looking to buy a condo at Trump Tower in the Philippines would have found, until this week, some video testimonials on the project\u2019s official website. There was Donald Trump, in a message filmed several years before he was elected president of the United States, declaring that the skyscraper bearing his name near the Philippine capital would be \u201csomething very, very special, like nobody\u2019s seen before. \u201d Then there was his daughter Ivanka Trump, now a senior White House adviser, lavishing praise on the project as a \u201cmilestone in Philippine real estate history.",
        "It should have been obvious, but I missed it: Stephen K. Bannon has been banished and Dennis Rodman is whispering in the president\u2019s ear. Okay, maybe not, but it could explain President Trump\u2019s sudden admiration for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whom he recently identified as a \u201cpretty smart cookie. \u201d Rodman, you\u2019ll recall, visited North Korea several times and has proclaimed Kim an \u201cawesome guy,\u201d saying he\u2019d be \u201ca friend for life. \u201d During his adventures in the Hermit Kingdom, Rodman attended and participated in basketball exhibitions for Kim and even sang \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to him.",
        "This is what laissez faire looks like. Washington, in its wisdom, deregulated the airline industry and later looked the other way as it underwent a series of leaving a oligopoly controlling 85 percent of the market. And what do we have to show for it? Reduced competition; packed cabins; tiny seats; proliferating fees for food, bags and flight changes; outsourcing of maintenance; boarding delays; higher fares in many cases; labyrinthine contracts that protect airlines rather than consumers; and routine overbooking.",
        "James W. Loewen is emeritus professor of sociology at the University of Vermont and the author of \u201cLies My Teacher Told Me\u201d and \u201cThe Confederate and Reader. \u201d President Trump yet again finds himself in possible Pinocchio land, this time for suggesting that Andrew Jackson could have \u2014 or would have \u2014 averted the Civil War. This claim is more complicated than the size of the crowd at Trump\u2019s inauguration, however. Trump has touched a controversy that has engaged historians and the public for more than a century. Trump\u2019s view on Jackson is unlikely but not absurd.",
        "Here\u2019s a shocking statement: President Trump is basically right that the world is too dangerous and that the United States should hold peace talks with, let\u2019s see, Chinese President Xi Jinping, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Russian President Vladimir Putin and any other autocrats who are making trouble. American values tell us to oppose the undemocratic policies of these leaders and their brethren, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. But our interests tell us to avoid war and seek agreements where possible.",
        "Doron Hindin provides global trade and regulatory advice at the international law firm Covington & Burling. There is increasing political tumult over the treatment of Israel at the United Nations. Last week, all 100 U. S. senators \u2014 Republicans and Democrats alike \u2014 admonished the organization for bias, and Sen. Marco Rubio ( .) recently sponsored a bill to withhold U. N. funding because of \u201c or rhetoric or propaganda. \u201d Add to that an important related bill now percolating through Congress that takes aim at a widely unknown initiative at the U. N.",
        "THE POLICE chief in the Dallas suburb of Balch Springs first said that the car Jordan Edwards was in when he was fatally shot by police was backing down the street in an \u201caggressive manner\u201d toward officers. Hours later, the statement was changed; police admitted that the car had actually been driving away from police when an officer with a rifle fatally shot the boy in the head. And so the questions begin.",
        "On Tuesday afternoon, the House of Representatives voted to pass a bill that Republicans have promoted since the Newt Gingrich era, one that would allow employees to exchange overtime pay for \u201dcompensatory time\u201d off, electing to accrue extra hours off rather than extra pay in their wallets. The bill passed 229 to 197, largely along party lines. The bill which supporters say would add flexibility to hourly workers\u2019 schedules while opponents worry it doesn\u2019t do enough to protect employees is not a new idea.",
        "The board of the Heritage Foundation on Tuesday ousted president Jim DeMint after days of turmoil and internal debate, blaming him for management and communication problems that have roiled the venerable conservative think tank. Thomas A. Saunders III, chairman of the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Board of Trustees, said in a statement that the board unanimously requested and received the resignation of DeMint, the firebrand former senator from South Carolina. Heritage founder Ed Feulner will serve in his place until a permanent successor is chosen.",
        "The Trump administration has delayed enforcement of a rule finalized last year that imposed strict oversight over electronic cigarettes and cigars for the first time. The move, which the Justice Department revealed in court filings Monday night in both the District and Alabama, comes as the vaping and tobacco industries are launching a concerted effort to roll back the Food and Drug Administration regulation through both legislation and litigation. A bipartisan group of lawmakers had tried over the weekend to insert language into a funding bill that would have exempted thousands of products from FDA scrutiny.",
        "Apple faces more pressure than ever to deliver with its highly anticipated iPhone, as the company reported Tuesday that it sold fewer iPhones than analysts had expected in the company\u2019s second quarter. Those looking forward to the new phone may have held off on buying a new device until the fall, analysts said. The sales come as Apple faces increased competition for the device that makes up the majority of Apple\u2019s profits. Apple sold 50 million iPhones in the past quarter, 1 million less than in the same period last year.",
        "Hillary Clinton emerged from political hibernation Tuesday by declaring herself \u201cpart of the resistance\u201d to Donald Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 and spreading blame for why it is not her sitting in the Oval Office. Making a rare public appearance, Clinton attributed her surprise loss in the 2016 election to interference by Russian hackers and the actions of FBI Director James B. Comey in the campaign\u2019s homestretch. \u201cIf the election had been on October 27, I would be your president,\u201d Clinton told moderator Christiane Amanpour, the CNN anchor, at a Women for Women International event in New York.",
        "HUNTSVILLE, Ark. \u2014 They were moving to a new house, a new life. Damien Wiggins, a who loved superheroes. His baby sister, Krystal. And their mother, who amid the rain had loaded up her SUV with the children\u2019s clothes to bring to her parents\u2019 house. She knew only one way to get there, and the route would take the family over a bridge along Glade Creek. That\u2019s where the floodwaters hit them, flipping the SUV and tearing the children away from their mother.",
        "This post has been updated. In a ad marking his first 100 days in office, President Trump labels major television networks \u201cfake news. \u201d So CNN is refusing to sell the president airtime to show the commercial. \u201cCNN requested that the advertiser remove the false graphic that the mainstream media is \u2019fake news,\u2019\u201d the cable channel said in a statement. \u201cThe mainstream media is not fake news, and therefore the ad is false and per policy will be accepted only if that graphic is deleted."
