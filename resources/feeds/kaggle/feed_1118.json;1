        "The videos on DaddyOFive\u2019s YouTube channel were hard to watch. In one, parents Heather and Mike Martin scream at Cody, accusing him of spilling ink on the ground. (He didn\u2019t spill anything, and the stains on the carpet were from trick ink). Another shows Cody being shoved into a bookcase. In a third, the dad encourages one of his sons to slap Emma, the only girl among the five children in the family. He does, hard enough to make Emma cry. When the broader YouTube community found out about the channel, there was an angry uprising.",

        "President Trump and his son Barron Trump look out as they ride in the inaugural parade in Washington on Jan. 20. (Photo by Jabin Washington Post) Washington Post columnist Dan Balz recently wrote President Trump \u201chas governed as he campaigned \u2014 unconventionally, unpredictably, in constant motion and unbowed in the face of criticism. \u201d From the perspective of photographer Jabin Botsford, tasked with covering the White House, the frenetic pace can be like a splash of cold water to the face.",
        "House Republican leaders said Wednesday that they plan to bring their controversial plan to revise key parts of the Affordable Care Act to a vote on Thursday, capping weeks of fits and starts in their attempt to fulfill a signature campaign promise. The flagging Republican effort to reshape the nation\u2019s system picked up steam Wednesday as GOP leaders tried to address concerns about people with preexisting medical conditions.",
        "Iowa\u2019s last major Affordable Care Act insurer threatened on Wednesday to pull out from the state\u2019s marketplace next year, the latest step in a sudden collapse of the state\u2019s insurance marketplace that holds ominous signs for health care customers in states across the county. If Medica follows through on its threat not to sell plans in 2018, Iowa could be the first state to lack any insurers on its exchanges in all but a handful of counties.",
        "PARIS \u2014 Emmanuel Macron, the in Sunday\u2019s French presidential election, shares something with President Trump: a age gap with his wife. The difference is that Macron\u2019s wife is the older one. That fact \u2014 a candidate young enough to be his wife\u2019s son, rather than old enough to be her father \u2014 is a little social \u201crevenge\u201d that delights many French women, including Martine Bergossi. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we marry younger men? I date them all the time,\u201d said Bergossi, the stylish owner of Alternatives, a shop in Paris, who prefers to leave her exact age to the imagination.",
        "FBI Director James B. Comey gave his most exhaustive defense yet Wednesday of his role in politically sensitive investigations, telling a Senate panel that he has no regrets \u2014 despite feeling \u201cmildly nauseous\u2019\u2019 at the thought that his decisions about a probe into Hillary Clinton might have affected the outcome of the election. He also said he was confident in the FBI\u2019s handling of an ongoing probe of any contacts between Russian officials and associates of President Trump.",
        "Stephen Colbert finally responded Wednesday to online criticism of his joke about President Trump that led to the hashtag #firecolbert and a call to boycott advertisers of the \u201cLate Show,\u201d which the comedian hosts. \u201cSo while I would do it again, I would change a few words that were cruder than they needed to be,\u201d he said during the taping of Wednesday\u2019s broadcast, according to a transcript released by CBS. \u201cI had a few choice insults for the president \u2026 I don\u2019t regret that. He, I believe, can take care of himself.",
        "So now it can be told: Bill Clinton cost his wife the presidency. Almost three hours into a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, FBI Director James Comey shed new light on his decision to go public about his agency\u2019s investigations into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, first in July 2016 and again, with devastating effect, in late October, 11 days before the election. The specific reason he cited: Bill Clinton\u2019s decision to board Attorney General Loretta Lynch\u2019s plane in late June, when their planes were both on a tarmac in Phoenix.",
        "It is urgent for Americans to think and speak clearly about President Trump\u2019s inability to do either. This seems to be not a mere disinclination but a disability. It is not merely the result of intellectual sloth but of an untrained mind bereft of information and married to stratospheric . In February, acknowledging Black History Month, Trump said that \u201cFrederick Douglass is an example of somebody who\u2019s done an amazing job and is getting recognized more and more, I notice.",
        "Blue America may fear President Trump and loathe him. But the president does not feel the same way toward blue America. I say this because there is a clever, readily available and probably popular combination of policies that would sow instant chaos, financial and political, in the states that voted for Hillary Clinton last year, as well as in the upper echelons of the Democratic Party that governs them. The fact that Trump has not suggested this plan \u2014 seemingly, it has not even occurred to him \u2014 is proof of his harmlessness. The scheme would work as follows.",
        "Christine Emba edits The Post\u2019s In Theory blog. Is it possible to be a good progressive and oppose abortion? This question was brought to the fore recently when Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez and Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) announced their support of Heath Mello, a candidate for mayor of Omaha who is also, inconveniently, antiabortion. Under pressure from abortion rights groups, Perez quickly walked back his support for Mello and said that being was \u201cnot negotiable\u201d for Democrats.",
        "Those of us in the world of and policy wonkery ought to be humbled: It often takes a celebrity, preferably a comedian, to break through with an argument that transforms public understanding. In particularly successful cases, the celebrity demolishes conventions and blurts out a deep truth that only occasionally makes it into the arguments and journalistic accounts. So here\u2019s hoping that Jimmy Kimmel wins some humanitarian awards for his monologue about the recent birth of his son Billy. He described how emergency heart surgery days after Billy was born saved his child\u2019s very new life.",
        "PRESIDENT TRUMP is getting closer to exiting the Paris climate agreement. According to reports emanating from the White House, the president\u2019s top lawyer shifted the internal debate last week. More meetings are to come. Yet the choice ought to be an easy one: Staying in the Paris accord is but pulling out is not. Paris exiters argue that the United States cannot remain in and revise downward the international commitment President Barack Obama made to cut U. S. emissions by 26 to 28 percent by 2025 \u2014 a pledge that, no matter how important for the planet, Mr.",
        "President Trump on Thursday plans to relax enforcement of rules barring churches from participating in politics as part of a executive order on religious liberties, according to senior White House officials. The order will also offer unspecified \u201cregulatory relief\u201d for religious objectors to an Obama administration mandate \u2014 already scaled back by the courts \u2014 that required contraception services as part of health plans, the officials said.",
        "The House voted Wednesday to approve a roughly $1. 1 trillion spending bill that includes more than $15 billion in defense spending and $1. 5 billion in money for U. S. border security, setting up a vote later this week in the Senate ahead of a deadline to keep the government open past Friday. The spending measure, which passed 309 to 118 and funds the federal government through September, is expected to clear the Senate easily this week before budget battles begin anew.",
        "LONDON \u2014 Prime Minister Theresa May made an explosive charge Wednesday that European Union officials are meddling in Britain\u2019s June election as tensions escalated over looming talks about British withdrawal from the European Union. Speaking outside her Downing Street offices, the British leader accused E. U. politicians and officials of issuing \u201cthreats\u201d that have been \u201cdeliberately timed to affect the result of the general election that will take place on the 8th of June.",
        "Ivanka Trump released a guide this week for working women, and it ignited mixed reactions from some of the role models featured in the book. The eldest first daughter, who serves as assistant to the president, cited 208 names in \u201cWomen Who Work\u201d by CNN reporter Betsy Klein\u2019s count \u2014 including Oprah Winfrey, Gandhi and Nietzsche. \u201cThe book equips readers with the best advice, tips and skills I\u2019ve learned over the years from many incredible people,\u201d Trump wrote on her Facebook page. \u201c \u2026 on building cultures where multidimensional women can thrive \u2014 now and in the future.",
        "Did anyone really expect this? Wasn\u2019t Stephen Colbert eviscerating President Trump or Samantha Bee destroying him \u2014 with jokes, of course \u2014 supposed to make some kind of difference in 2017? Of all the comedians \u2014 including ones who consistently make Trump the target of brutally biting jokes \u2014 it\u2019s Jimmy Kimmel who thus far has had the most influence in a serious political conversation in the Trump era. And he didn\u2019t do it with an impersonation or a particularly epic takedown or a but with an emotional, monologue about his newborn son\u2019s heart condition.",
        "Puerto Rico teetered into insolvency Wednesday as the chronically troubled U. S. territory of 3. 4 million citizens buckled under its debt, which stands at $73 billion. The process that Puerto Rico has undertaken is a prelude to bankruptcy, but in this case it is tailored for governments. Given the size of the debt, it would be the largest such insolvency in U. S. history, far outstripping Detroit\u2019s $18 billion restructuring in 2013. \u201cPuerto Rico\u2019s problems have been decades in the making,\u201d said Michael F. Williams, the attorney who represented Puerto Rico in its financial crisis litigation until recently.",
        "Retired Air Force Lt. Col. Leo K. Thorsness, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during a dogfight over North Vietnam and who later spent six years in the enemy prison camp known as the Hanoi Hilton, died May 2 at a hospital in Jacksonville, Fla. He was 85. The Congressional Medal of Honor Society announced his death. The cause was not disclosed. During the Vietnam War, Col. Thorsness was one of only 13 members of the Air Force to receive the Medal of Honor, the military\u2019s highest award for valor.",
        "House Republicans on Thursday narrowly passed a controversial bill to overhaul the nation\u2019s system, claiming a major victory even as the measure faces an uncertain fate in the closely divided U. S. Senate. Under intense pressure to show they can govern and to make good on their promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Republicans pushed through the bill after adopting a change that earned it just enough votes to pass. However, the House version fell significantly short of the GOP\u2019s goals, making major dents in large portions of the current law but not outright repealing it.",
        "House Republicans journeyed to the White House on Thursday for a victory lap in the Rose Garden, but Senate Republicans were in no mood for celebration. Instead, they sent an unmistakable message: When it comes to health care, we\u2019re going to do our own thing. \u201cI think there will be essentially a Senate bill,\u201d explained Sen. Roy Blunt ( .) the Senate Republican. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a Senate bill, so we\u2019ll look at it,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Flake ( . ).",
        "Republicans pushed a bill through the House Thursday that few lawmakers truly liked. They instead viewed the measure as a necessary step to demonstrate some sense of momentum and some ability to govern in Washington. Rather than embrace policy cobbled together to replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, many Republicans simply decided the best move was to approve a flawed bill \u2014 and ram it through a flawed process \u2014 so that the Senate would get a chance to fix the House\u2019s mistakes, setting up a major negotiation later.",
        "With House Republicans prepared to take a vote Thursday on yet another version of a plan to overhaul the 2010 Affordable Care Act, attention has been especially focused on whether Obamacare\u2019s popular prohibition against denying coverage based on preexisting medical conditions will remain in place. Republicans, from President Trump to lawmakers pushing for the bill, insist that it remains intact, just in different form. Democrats and opponents of the bill say the guarantee is gone or greatly weakened. Here\u2019s a tweet by House Speaker Paul D.",
        "Q: Is the bill that passed the House today intended to repeal the Affordable Care Act? Not entirely. In the seven years since a Democratic Congress and the Obama administration pushed through the ACA, the House has taken more than 60 votes to repeal all or part of it. But today\u2019s vote was a effort, with the bill intended \u2014 at least originally \u2014 to address only those parts of the sprawling law with budgetary implications.",
        "It was one thing for Donald Trump to pledge on the campaign trail that his plan for health care would assure that every American had coverage. He did so repeatedly, including during a town hall event in February 2016 at which he said his promise to \u201ctake care\u201d of everyone might sound as if he was talking about a system, but he wasn\u2019t. \u201cThat\u2019s not \u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not anything. That\u2019s just human decency. \u201d It was another thing, though, for Trump to make similar claims after the election.",
        "As House Republicans proudly passed their bill on Thursday, Democrats trolled them \u2014 hard. They sang \u201cNa na na na, na na na na, hey hey hey, goodbye!\u201d and waved at the GOP. It was a pretty good one, as political gimmicks go. But was it accurate? Are some Republicans signing their own death warrants in the 2018 election? There is no doubt that votes such as a bill can have and electoral implications. Look no further than Democrats and Obamacare. They were arguably still paying the price for that one in the 2016 election.",
        "With near unanimity, my friends confess a sense of relief. It could have been worse. They thought it would be worse. A deep apprehension still endures but the international order remains intact, the republic still stands, and no \u201cenemy of the people\u201d has (yet) been arrested. Admittedly, this is a low bar. And this is not to deny the insanity, incoherence and sheer weirdness emanating daily from the White House, with which we\u2019ve all come up with our own coping technique. Here\u2019s mine: I simply view President Trump as the Wizard of Oz. Loud and bombastic. A charlatan.",
        "For years, reports of a mythical figure have lingered in Washington and reverberated through congressional districts around the country. Its legend is spread by talking heads, donors, even many of us in the news media. This is the Myth of the Moderate Republican. To be sure, among the general population, moderate Republicans are real and plentiful. But not on Capitol Hill, where the Moderate Republican \u2014 a creature whose prudence and clearheadedness will rescue the country from the uncompromising dogmatism of the House Freedom Caucus \u2014 is an extraordinary popular delusion, a madness of crowds."
