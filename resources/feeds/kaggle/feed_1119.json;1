        "Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Republican, represents Washington\u2019s 5th District in the House and is the chair of the House Republican Conference. (Daron Washington Post) Hearing host Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s emotional monologue this week about his son\u2019s condition and his family\u2019s experience in the moments after his birth, I had a flashback to the day my son was born and we learned he had Down syndrome. My husband and I had a lot of questions about Cole\u2019s future. Whether he\u2019d have health care shouldn\u2019t have had to be one of them.",
        "With the House\u2019s passage of the American Health Care Act, House Republican leaders have handed their Senate counterparts the biggest legislative weapon they have held in their entire careers. At this point, Senate Republicans should learn from a bit of wisdom often attributed to one of the wittiest and most Founders, Ben Franklin: \u201cWe must, indeed, all hang together,\u201d he supposedly told the Continental Congress in 1776, \u201cor most assuredly we shall all hang separately.",
        "There has been much focus on President Trump\u2019s erratic foreign policy \u2014 the outlandish positions, the many the mistakes. But far more damaging in the long run might be what some have termed the Trump effect: his impact on the domestic politics of other countries. That effect appears to be powerful, negative and enduring. It could undermine decades of U. S. foreign policy successes. Look at Mexico. For generations, this was a country defined by fiery . Founded by a radical revolutionary movement, fueled by anger against U. S. imperialism and Mexico would rarely cooperate with Washington.",
        "PRESIDENT TRUMP appointed an energy secretary who wanted to abolish the Energy Department and an Environmental Protection Agency chief who opposed much of what the EPA does. Even so, the selection of someone who doesn\u2019t believe in contraception to take charge of federal family planning efforts strains all credulity. It is a cynical appointment that underscores the dangers this administration poses to women\u2019s health.",
        "ISTANBUL \u2014 Russia, Iran and Turkey said Thursday that they have agreed to create \u201c zones\u201d across four areas in Syria, renewing diplomatic efforts to bring warring parties in the country to heel after six years of fighting. Meeting in the Kazakh capital, Astana, the three powers said the deal would come into force Saturday and would apply to both government and rebel forces in the designated areas, where the Islamic State does not hold large swaths of territory.",
        "The governor of Texas is poised to sign a sweeping bill that would outlaw sanctuary jurisdictions in the state and impose costly fines and even jail time on officials who refuse to cooperate with U. S. immigration agents. It makes clear that local law enforcement officers may ask people they detain about their immigration status, a line of questioning that critics say should be reserved for federal immigration agents. \u201cI\u2019m getting my signing pen warmed up,\u201d Gov. Greg Abbott (R) tweeted this week. His state is home to the number of undocumented immigrants in the nation, some 1.",
        "KABUL \u2014 Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a controversial Afghan militia leader who has spent the past two decades as a fugitive abroad, returned Thursday to the city he once attacked mercilessly and made an impassioned appeal for peace and unity in his homeland. The extraordinary scene was unimaginable even a year ago, when Hekmatyar was a wanted terrorist under U. N. sanctions, leading armed fighters against NATO and Afghan forces in a alliance with the Taliban, and hundreds of his followers were in prison.",
        "A Southern California father said he and his family were booted from a Delta flight after they declined to give up a seat they had bought for their teenage son and were attempting to use for his sibling. Brian and Brittany Schear, of Huntington Beach, were on a flight April 23 from Maui to Los Angeles when they got into an argument with officials after being told that they had to give the seat to another passenger.",
        "Jon Iadonisi, a friend and business associate of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, had two projects underway in the fall of 2016. One of his companies was helping Flynn with an investigative effort for an ally of the Turkish government \u2014 details of which Flynn revealed only after he was forced to step down from his White House post. At the same time, Iadonisi was also doing work for the Trump campaign, although his role was not publicly reported, according to people familiar with his involvement.",
        "Black applicants for Fairfax County teaching positions in a recent school year were far less likely than white candidates to get job offers even though they had on average more advanced degrees and classroom experience, according to a new study that is drawing intense scrutiny within the school system. George Mason University researchers, who conducted the study published in the spring issue of Harvard Educational Review, did not identify the school system they were writing about.",
        "President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order aimed at making it easier for churches to participate in politics, seeking to deliver on a campaign pledge to a community that overwhelmingly backed in him in last year\u2019s election. The order, which Trump unveiled with great fanfare in a Rose Garden ceremony, was cheered by some conservative Christians but seen as a disappointment by others, who said it fell short of the broader changes they wanted as part of a highly anticipated measure on religious liberties.",
        "The Senate voted Thursday to approve a $1. 1 trillion spending bill to fund the government through September, preventing a government shutdown. President Trump is expected to sign the measure, which passed 79 to 18. It includes more than $15 billion in new defense spending and $1. 5 billion in money for U. S. border security, ahead of a deadline to keep the government open past Friday. The spending measure clears the way for Congress to begin talks over spending priorities for the fiscal year that begins in October.",
        "\u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\u201d delivers on many of the promises of its predecessor, echoing its familiar teasing humor, and irreverent, vibe. Most obviously, it doubles down on a retro, \u2019 soundtrack that resurrects Top 40 hits from the and eras with shamelessly ingratiating abandon.",
        "Former national security adviser Michael Flynn was warned by senior members of President Trump\u2019s transition team about the risks of his contacts with the Russian ambassador weeks before the December call that led to Flynn\u2019s forced resignation, current and former U. S. officials said. Flynn was told during a late November meeting that Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak\u2019s conversations were almost certainly being monitored by U. S. intelligence agencies, officials said, a caution that came a month before Flynn was recorded discussing U. S. sanctions against Russia with Kislyak, suggesting that the Trump administration would reevaluate the issue.",
        "With one hasty and excruciatingly narrow vote, House Republicans have all but guaranteed that health care will be one of the most pivotal issues shaping the next two election cycles \u2014 including congressional, gubernatorial and state legislative races in the 2018 midterms and President Trump\u2019s likely reelection bid in 2020. Just as Democrats were forced to defend Obamacare in the 2010 midterms \u2014 the result was a drubbing that President Barack Obama called a \u201cshellacking\u201d \u2014 Republicans this time will be in the hot seat.",
        "DALLAS  \u201d A white Texas police officer has been charged with murder in the shooting of a black teenager for which the officer was fired, according to an arrest warrant issued Friday.",
        "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 In one corner of a packed and muggy hotel ballroom sat a man wearing a black \u201cTeam Trump\u201d . But in another was a sign urging: \u201cTRUMPCARE GO (BACK) TO SIBERIA. \u201d At the front stood Tom Cotton, an ambitious Republican senator plunged into the crossfire on health care by the election of Donald Trump. \u201cSenator Cotton, do you support repealing the Affordable Care Act so that 300, 000 Arkansas citizens will lose their health care?\u201d a woman asked him at a town hall meeting here this year.",
        "PARIS \u2014 The campaign of French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron said late Friday that it has been subjected to a \u201cmassive and coordinated piracy action\u201d of emails and other internal communications. The announcement emerged as the last official day of campaigning in France\u2019s most contentious presidential election in decades drew to a close. Macron, an independent centrist, is facing off against the populist Marine Le Pen. Voters are set to decide Sunday which candidate becomes France\u2019s next president.",
        "George P. Shultz, a former U. S. secretary of labor, treasury and state, is a distinguished fellow at the Hoover Institution. Martin Feldstein is professor of economics at Harvard University and former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and president of the National Bureau of Economic Research. If a country consumes more than it produces, it must import more than it exports. That\u2019s not a ; that\u2019s arithmetic. If we manage to negotiate a reduction in the Chinese trade surplus with the United States, we will have an increased trade deficit with some other country.",
        "Ivanka Trump\u2019s new book came out this past week, and, what with all the focus on her father\u2019s step toward yanking health care from millions of people and his fulminating about Andrew Jackson and the Civil War, \u201cWomen Who Work\u201d didn\u2019t receive the attention it deserves. Okay, maybe it did. As its acerbic reviewers have observed, the book is a parodic pastiche of the genre. This is a woman who uses \u201carchitect\u201d as a verb \u2014 repeatedly. As in, \u201cevery woman should thoughtfully architect a life she\u2019ll love and actively work toward achieving her goals.",
        "We should never forget May 4, 2017. It should forever be marked as the day when the House of Representatives descended to a new level of cruelty, irresponsibility and social meanness. The lower chamber has always claimed to be \u201cthe people\u2019s house. \u201d No more. It should now come to be known by other names: the house of selfishness, the house of suffering, the house of the wealthy, the house of expediency, the house of untreated illness. Perhaps also: the house of Trump.",
        "How does this happen? On Wednesday, the House passed a $1. 2 trillion spending bill by a lopsided margin of 309 to 118. A majority of both Democrats and Republicans supported the measure, which sailed through the Senate. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( .) and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) alike celebrated, and President Trump said of the spending bill: \u201cThis is what winning looks like!\u201d Yet the day after this bill passed the House, the chamber split down the middle as it passed the \u201cTrumpcare\u201d legislation repealing Obamacare.",
        "On a recent morning in Maiduguri, in Nigeria\u2019s Borno state, a series of suicide bombs ripped through a gas station. A few hundred yards from the scene, locals paused for a minute, chatting as a plume of black smoke rose into the dawn sky before continuing with their daily routines. Bombings are regular enough that Nigerians are largely unperturbed by them now. When fighters from the Islamic militant group Boko Haram ride through towns on motorbikes, mounting attacks on passing military convoys, villagers don\u2019t pay much attention.",
        "BY NOW it is clear that no big new stretch of physical wall will rise anytime soon along the Southwest border. Owing to President Trump, however, a towering wall of hostility directed at Mexico is already surely in place. And its effects, while impermanent, are nonetheless real. Those effects are already imposing stiff costs on the United States in prestige, goodwill and moral authority, as well as more tangible expenses: International travel associations, as well as U. S. hotel executives, warn that rising nationalism, stoked by Mr.",
        "The Trump administration\u2019s second Army secretary nominee withdrew from consideration Friday amid mounting opposition to past comments he made about Islam, evolution and gender issues. Mark E. Green, a firebrand Republican state senator in Tennessee and veteran of the Iraq War, said there can be no distractions in overseeing the military and blamed \u201cfalse and misleading attacks against him\u201d in a statement provided to the media.",
        "Federal prosecutors are looking into whether Fox News Channel and its parent company tried to disguise a $3. 15 million payment to a former employee who said she had a affair with the network\u2019s former chairman, Roger Ailes, according to people involved with the investigation. Investigators in the U. S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York have focused on a payment to Laurie Luhn, a former Fox booker and event planner who left the company in 2011 with the severance package.",
        "Delta Air Lines this week was the latest airline carrier to come under fire for harsh treatment of passengers. A video posted online by a California father shows his family being kicked off a flight after they refused to give up their \u2019s seat, which they had originally purchased for their teenage son. Experts say the video \u2014 which includes an agent threatening to put the parents in jail, and debate about whether a car seat is safe during air travel \u2014 raises a number of questions.",
        "Eighteen fraternity members were charged in the death of a Pennsylvania State University student who fell multiple times after consuming toxic levels of alcohol \u2014 and whose own friends failed to get help for him for many hours, authorities said. [A Penn State student fell down the stairs at a fraternity. And for nearly 12 hours, no one called police] The fraternity brothers\u2019 actions, and inaction, were detailed in grand jury investigation findings released Friday by Centre County District Attorney Stacy Parks Miller. The Beta Theta Pi chapter was charged as well.",
        "This is the 30th anniversary of a moment that changed my life, when I discovered that a public school in a poor Hispanic neighborhood could produce 26 percent of all the successful Mexican American Advanced Placement calculus students in the country by giving students more time and encouragement to learn. My focus since then has been to explore how this was done and identify those schools working hardest to challenge students from all backgrounds with courses such as AP and International Baccalaureate.",
        "European elections countdown: In this occasional series, we take a look at what is at stake in key European elections this year. One outcome of the French presidential election on Sunday is certain: Europe won\u2019t be the same. The choice between candidates, however, could hardly be more stark. A victory by candidate Marine Le Pen would shake the foundations of the Western world. President Trump\u2019s victory was seen as consequential in Europe, but a Le Pen win would be incomparably more significant, some liberals say."
