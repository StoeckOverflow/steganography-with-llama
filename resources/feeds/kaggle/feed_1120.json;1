        "The military in Nigeria has been fighting the insurgent group Boko Haram for eight years and vigorously inspects men and women for suicide vests. In response, the group increasingly has enlisted children to carry out such attacks. According to a recent report from UNICEF, there were 27 suicide attacks by children in the first quarter of 2017 in Nigeria, up from nine in the same period last year.

For more than 15 minutes, McConnell did most of the talking. The new president listened keenly. Eleven days later, McConnell had a seat as Trump announced Neil M. Gorsuch as his pick for the Supreme Court, the culmination of the Senate majority leader\u2019s advice during the campaign on how to handle the court vacancy: Consult the Federalist Society, and make a list of prospects. Trump did that.",
        "When House Republicans posted enough votes to pass their plan to revamp the nation\u2019s system Thursday, Democrats broke out into song. So convinced it was a political loser, Democratic lawmakers sang \u201cNah Nah Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye\u201d the way victorious sports fans jeer their opponents. Their head of candidate recruitment guaranteed that Republicans would \u201cpay a price\u201d in 2018, saying he planned to use the controversial legislation as an incentive for prospective Democratic candidates to jump into races. \u201cI have a significant number of hours blocked out to make phone calls,\u201d Rep.

        "MOSUL, Iraq \u2014 Inside the Captain pool hall in eastern Mosul there are few signs that a war still rages in this city or that earlier this year the Islamic State was in control here.

        "PARIS \u2014 Ever since Donald Trump proved last November that anything is possible in the new world of Western politics, May 7 has been circled on European calendars with a mix of giddy anticipation and existential dread. To populists, the presidential election in France \u2014 a country scarred by unemployment and terrorism \u2014 seemed to offer the next big opportunity to remake the postwar global order in their own nationalist, nativist and protectionist image.",

        "Late Friday night, they appeared: thousands of pages of documents allegedly stolen from Emmanuel Macron\u2019s campaign. The data dump, which first appeared on the website Pastebin, included staffers\u2019 personal and professional emails, along with contracts and campaign finance information for the French presidential candidate. In the United States, such leaked content would be the stuff of media coverage. (See, for example, the thousands of articles and news segments produced about the Democratic National Committee\u2019s leaked emails.) In France, though, the press has been noticeably silent.

        "This weekend, if projections are true, France will turn back from the abyss. This is the message that has dominated American commentary since Emmanuel Macron, a charismatic, politically moderate former Socialist, investment banker and economics minister, took first place in the initial round of French presidential voting last month.

        "Global financial markets and European Union leaders heaved a sigh of relief after the first round of the French presidential election last month. And so did professional pollsters. It turns out the polls were not broken in France, as they were said to have been in the American presidential election and the British Brexit vote. But in truth, France wasn\u2019t a departure. The polls in the United States and Britain generally worked well. As a new report this past week from the American Association for Public Opinion Research pointed out, national surveys in the U. S.",
