        "Before you do anything else, spend a moment thinking about the extraordinary achievement of modern France\u2019s youngest Emmanuel Macron. Not since Napoleon has anybody leapt to the top of French public life with such speed. Not since World War II has anybody won the French presidency without a political party and a parliamentary base. Aside from some belated endorsements, he had little real support from the French establishment, few of whose members rated the chances of a man from an unfashionable town when he launched his candidacy last year.",
        "The voters of France acted responsibly and decently on Sunday. But they also sent a warning. France\u2019s new is Emmanuel Macron, a centrist whose solid victory over the National Front\u2019s Marine Le Pen offered yet another sign that the rise of President Trump is not the harbinger of a new and unhinged form of nationalism. For now, the center is holding, pluralism is hanging on, and the far right is being held in check.",
        "For almost four decades, the United States has upheld its commitment to help Taiwan provide for its own against China \u2014 but the Trump administration has yet to affirm it. As a planned package lingers in limbo, officials, lawmakers and experts worry that President Trump may be granting yet another unreciprocated concession to Beijing. The relatively small sale to Taiwan \u2014 worth just more than $1 billion \u2014 was set to go in late 2016, but the Obama administration never pulled the trigger.",
        "China is bent on world domination \u2014 not with its missiles and aircraft carriers, but by controlling solar energy, cloud computing and other industries of the future. That is an only slightly exaggerated version of a warning coming from the American chamber of commerce in China. It sent a delegation to Washington last week to warn that \u201cChina\u2019s aggressive mercantilist policies are one of the most serious threats facing the future of U. S. advanced technology sectors,\u201d as their policy paper says \u2014 and that the U. S. government isn\u2019t doing enough to counter the threat.",
        "We are defining prosperity down \u2014 or, more accurately, prosperity is defining itself down. We are eight years into the recovery from the Great Recession, the unemployment rate has dropped to 4. 4 percent, the stock market is pushing record highs, and consumer confidence seems robust. And yet the economy doesn\u2019t feel as good as it looks. Anxieties lurk. There is an explanation, argues Ruchir Sharma. This doesn\u2019t feel like a typical business cycle recovery, because it isn\u2019t. We have entered a new era of low economic growth and high political disappointment.",
        "GOOD NEWS! Puerto Rico has officially gone bankrupt. Now, we don\u2019t mean that literally. There is no cause for celebration in the financial disaster that has befallen the Caribbean home of 3. 7 million U. S. citizens. Nor, in a legal sense, is the process that\u2019s about to unfold the precise equivalent of what a corporation would go through under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code, or a municipality under Chapter 9.",
        "Several Republican leaders have formed a political barricade around the bill that narrowly passed the House last week, defending how the legislation would change insurance coverage for people with preexisting illness or injury. But while House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) and Trump administration officials on Sunday rallied around the House legislation after intense criticism from Democrats, who say the bill would strip protections, moderate Senate Republicans were outright dismissive. \u201cThe House bill is not going to come before us,\u201d Sen.",
        "At first, Cordell Davis thought his fellow pledge had just had too much to drink, he said. They were new initiates to Beta Theta Pi fraternity at Penn State and had just run the gantlet \u2014 a series of stations where they guzzled beer, wine and vodka as fast as they could. But Tim Piazza had fallen down a flight of stairs on that morning in February and was on a couch in the frat house, unresponsive. Davis said he thought he should be at a hospital instead, and told his new frat brothers so.",
        "Just before her 100th day in office, D. C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser stood before a packed house at the city\u2019s historic Lincoln Theatre and called on taxpayers to make an unprecedented investment in the poor. For the first time, she announced, the District would devote $100 million in city funds each year to the Housing Production Trust Fund \u2014 a lifeline for families struggling to find a place to live in one of the least affordable cities in the country.",
        "TOKYO \u2014 North Korea has detained another American who worked at a private university in Pyongyang, taking to four the number of U. S. citizens being held by Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime. Kim who worked for the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, was detained Saturday, North Korea\u2019s state news agency said. Kim was arrested on suspicion of \u201chostile acts\u201d against North Korea, the official Korean Central News Agency said. \u201cA relevant institution is now conducting a detailed investigation into his crimes,\u201d it said. No other details about him were available.",
        "LOS ANGELES \u2014 One of the first things Georgia Hardstark and Karen Kilgariff figured out is that the genre isn\u2019t just a vehicle for sometimes gruesome tales of women in jeopardy. At its most primal level, it\u2019s storytelling. It\u2019s town gossip, but with hatchets. And gossip is for everyone. Hardstark and Kilgariff, the hosts of podcast phenomenon \u201cMy Favorite Murder,\u201d believe that anyone who claims not to like true crime just hasn\u2019t found the right murder yet. Are you grossed out by serial killers like the Vampire of Sacramento (\u201cMy Favorite Murder\u201d Episode 10)?",
        "Lady Gaga \u2014 all in black and wearing a witch\u2019s hat \u2014 is interviewing Julian Assange in the Ecuadoran Embassy in London, where he\u2019s been holed up for years. As the pop star, in a bizarre scene from a new documentary, quizzes the WikiLeaks founder about everything from his legal problems to his favorite food, Assange interrupts: \u201cLet\u2019s not pretend for a moment I\u2019m a normal person. \u201d Indeed, in Laura Poitras\u2019s film about Assange, \u201cRisk,\u201d he comes across as neither normal nor particularly sympathetic.",
        "President Trump\u2019s most senior military and foreign policy advisers have proposed a major shift in strategy in Afghanistan that would effectively put the United States back on a war footing with the Taliban. The new plan, which still needs the approval of the president, calls for expanding the U. S. military role as part of a broader effort to push an increasingly confident and resurgent Taliban back to the negotiating table, U. S. officials said.",
        "Former acting attorney general Sally Yates testified Monday she expected White House officials to \u201ctake action\u2019\u2019 on her January warning that security adviser Michael Flynn could be blackmailed by Russia, offering her first public statements about the national security concerns that rocked the early days of the Trump administration. Yates\u2019 testimony to a Senate Judiciary subcommittee capped months of debate over her role in the ouster of Flynn, a retired general who stayed on at the White House for 18 days after Yates\u2019 warning.",
        "On Monday, we learned much more about the moment that brought down Michael Flynn, the national security adviser whom President Trump fired less than a month into the job for misleading Vice President Pence about his conversations with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States. But we were also left with questions about why the White House waited 18 days after finding out Flynn misled them to fire him. Former acting attorney general Sally Q. Yates and former director of national intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. testified about all this Monday before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee.",
        "Former acting attorney general Sally Yates and James R. Clapper Jr. the former director of national intelligence, are testifying at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. This is the transcript of the hearing. [Sally Yates testifies about White House meeting] SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, . C.: \u2026 Our two witnesses are well known and will be sworn in but Mr. Clapper, the former director of national intelligence has served his country for decades in uniform and out and dedicated his life to intelligence gathering and we appreciate that. Ms.",
        "President Barack Obama personally warned Donald Trump against hiring Michael Flynn as his national security adviser last fall as Trump began his transition, current and former administration officials said on Monday. Obama delivered his warning on Nov. 10, two days after the election, when Trump visited the White House and met with Obama in the Oval Office for what both men described at the time as a cordial conversation. White House press secretary Sean Spicer confirmed the discussion, which was first reported by NBC News, but played down the seriousness of Obama\u2019s warning.",
        "President Trump has already rendered a verdict on his own skills as a legislative negotiator \u2014 in a pathetically premature Rose Garden celebration of a House vote to repeal and replace Obamacare. The full picture is not quite so rosy. As a policy leader, Trump is unique among recent presidents. He doesn\u2019t lead on policy. Normally a president who wants action on health care would try to unite the caucus by putting forth his own substantive ideas and getting legislators to support them.",
        "I once wrote a column in praise of competence. The object of my admiration was Walter Mondale, then running for president against Ronald Reagan. The president\u2019s message was that it was \u201cmorning again in America. \u201d Mondale\u2019s message was that he was competent. He lost 49 states. He was Hillary Clinton even before she was. The comparison is apt \u2014 and sad.",
        "Sooner or later, we will have universal, health care in this country \u2014 sooner if Republicans succeed in destroying the Affordable Care Act, later if they fail. The bill passed by the House last week is nothing short of an abomination. It is so bad that Republicans can defend it only by blowing smoke and telling lies. \u201cYou cannot be denied coverage if you have a preexisting condition,\u201d House Speaker Paul D.",
        "It had the makings of a Cold War whodunit: The attorney general tells the White House that the Russians have \u201ckompromat\u201d on the president\u2019s national security adviser \u2014 but the president, for reasons unclear, stands by the compromised official. On the morning of Jan. 26, acting attorney general Sally Yates called White House counsel Don McGahn with a matter so sensitive it couldn\u2019t be discussed by phone.",
        "Trumpcare is, on the whole, terrible. But if you\u2019re a millennial, it does have one thing going for it: It\u2019s virtually the only piece of the Trump platform that advantages the young at the expense of the old. The rest of the Trump agenda could be broadly characterized as generational warfare against the young. If enacted, it will rob millennials and subsequent generations of earnings, benefits, consumer protections and even \u2014 if you look far enough into the future \u2014 a habitable place to live. Let\u2019s start with the Trump tax plan.",
        "THE MASSIVE leak of documents from the campaign of Emmanuel Macron failed to prevent his landslide victory Sunday in the French presidential election. But perhaps his defeat was not the goal of the leak. Mr. Macron already had a wide lead when the files were posted on the Internet Friday night, the result of a hack that said bore the fingerprints of a group tied to Russia\u2019s military intelligence service. Nor did the archive appear to contain much in the way of compromising information.",
        "Two months before Monday\u2019s announcement that Sinclair Broadcast Group would pay $3. 9 billion for Tribune Media and add to its dominance as the nation\u2019s largest owner of local TV stations, a top executive at Sinclair beamed a short commentary piece to many of the company\u2019s 173 stations.",
        "RICHMOND \u2014 President Trump\u2019s political statements trailed him on Monday in court, where judges seemed skeptical his revised travel ban was based on national security concerns rather than his campaign promise to ban Muslims from entering the United States. Thirteen judges on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit were considering the case, and, during an extraordinary hearing, judge after judge asked acting solicitor general Jeffrey B. Wall about statements during the campaign and afterward in which Trump talked about a Muslim ban.",
        "Sen. Dianne Feinstein on Monday said that an effort by the sister of senior White House adviser Jared Kushner to offer U. S. visas to Chinese investors is a stark conflict of interest ? and called for the program s elimination. Nicole Kushner Meyer on Saturday appeared at an event urging Chinese citizens to invest $500, 000 each in a New Jersey luxury apartment building that her company plans to develop. Jared Kushner previously oversaw the project until he left the company earlier this year to be a senior adviser to President Trump.",
        "Immigration whose fortunes are rising under the Trump administration have released a confidential letter from the Justice Department\u2019s immigration court that blasted lawyers for targeting them with \u201cderogatory \u201d based on a report by the Southern Poverty Law Center. At issue was the SPLC\u2019s repeated claim that the Federation for American Immigration Reform is a \u201chate group\u201d as well as its escalating efforts to prove that the federation, which favors stricter control over legal and illegal immigration, is racist. The immigration court\u2019s letter \u2014 sent during the Obama administration \u2014 does not resolve that dispute.",
        "Life expectancy is rising overall in the United States, but in some areas, death rates are going conspicuously in the other direction. These geographical disparities are widening, according to a report published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine. Life expectancy is greatest in the high country of central Colorado, but in many pockets of the United States, life expectancy is more than 20 years lower, according to the report from the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. \u201cLife expectancy in many places in this country is declining.",
        "Former president Barack Obama might be getting all the attention for that reported $65 million book deal, but former president Bill Clinton is soon coming out with an unusual book: He\u2019s writing a novel with prolific thriller writer James Patterson. Clinton and Patterson are \u201cThe President is Missing,\u201d which will debut in June 2018, the Associated Press reports.",
        "PARIS \u2014 In the country that invented the modern notions of political right and left, Emmanuel Macron won the French presidency from perhaps the most precarious place possible: the center. Now he has to figure out how to govern from there. Macron\u2019s victory on Sunday as a political newcomer who enjoyed no party backing and faced a wave of populist anger was improbable enough. But the task he began confronting Monday is even more difficult."
