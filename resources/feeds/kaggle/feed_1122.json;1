        "President Barack Obama signaled when he left office that he\u2019d largely stay out of U. S. politics, as former presidents traditionally do, but would break his silence to weigh in on \u201cissues or certain moments where I think our core values may be at stake. \u201d And aside from a few short statements released through aides, Obama has largely stayed out of the political fray in the months since President Trump\u2019s inauguration. But that all changed Sunday, when Obama went directly after Republicans attempting to overturn his signature piece of legislation, the Affordable Care Act.",

        "FBI Director James B. Comey has been dismissed by the president, according to White House spokesman Sean Spicer a startling move that officials said stemmed from a conclusion by Justice Department officials that he had mishandled the probe of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. Comey was fired as he is leading a counterintelligence investigation to determine whether associates of President Trump may have coordinated with Russia to meddle with the presidential election last year. That probe began quietly last July but has now become the subject of intense debate in Washington. It is unclear how Comey\u2019s dismissal will affect that investigation.",
        "President Trump fired FBI Director James B. Comey on Tuesday. And while the termination happened rather quickly \u2014 mere hours after Comey\u2019s faulty testimony to Congress was revealed \u2014 it wasn\u2019t altogether a shock. Over the past several weeks, Trump seemed to be in the market for a reason to get rid of Comey. This was an Obama appointee whom Trump derided during the 2016 campaign for not recommending charges against Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server. Then, in March, Comey announced that the FBI was investigating alleged ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.",

And this is a bonfire. \u2014 Seth Moulton (@sethmoulton) May 9, 2017 Democrats think FBI Director James Comey cost them the presidential election. But hardly any Democrats in Congress are celebrating the fact that he\u2019s gone.

        "When you\u2019re the TV network that people rely on for breaking news, it helps to have an analyst or two who can speak with authority when something big happens.
