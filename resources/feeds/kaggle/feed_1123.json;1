        "The Senate Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena Wednesday to force former national security adviser Michael Flynn to turn over documents related to the panel\u2019s probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, including possible ties between the Kremlin and the presidential campaigns. It is the first subpoena the committee has announced in the course of its Russia investigation \u2014 a step Chairman Richard Burr ( . C.) was long reluctant to take.",
        "The news of James Comey s political demise had broken less than 10 minutes before Stephen Colbert began his taping on Tuesday evening. And when he informed his live audience, trapped in a soundstage \u201d the FBI director has just been fired by Donald Trump ? \u201d they initially reacted by breaking into cheers. This was a man, after all, that Colbert s viewership had viewed as a bad guy. He raised Hillary Clinton s email scandal from the dead; he might have cost her the election. Wow, wow, ? Colbert said, appearing taken aback by the applause.",
        "You can read here about how Sean Spicer literally hid from reporters in bushes after President Trump fired his FBI director last night. The White House press secretary eventually agreed to give a brief interview in the dark, without cameras. Spicer may have had good reason to be shy, as Trump surrogates discovered when they attempted to explain James Comey\u2019s sudden firing to some extraordinarily skeptical cable news hosts. We collect those aides\u2019 explanations below \u2014 along with the eye rolls, lectures and open hostility with which they were met.",
        "\u201cBy 1908, the time was right for a new kind of agency to protect America. The United States was, well, united, with its borders stretching from coast to coast and only two landlocked states left to officially join the union. Inventions like the telephone, the telegraph, and the railroad had seemed to shrink its vast distances even as the country had spread west. . . . America was . . . a new world power on the block, thanks to its naval victory over Spain.",
        "Mitch McConnell is no Howard Baker. Baker, the late Republican senator from Tennessee and GOP Senate leader in the 1970s and 1980s, became a profile in courage when he put country above party during the Watergate investigation, famously asking,\u201cWhat did the president know, and when did he know it?\u201d McConnell, who now occupies the high office Baker once held, had a chance Wednesday for his Baker moment. The night before, President Trump had fired FBI Director James Comey, the man overseeing the investigation into Russian interference in the election with potential Trump campaign collusion.",
        "\u201cBut what good came of it at last?\u201d Quoth little Peterkin. \u201cWhy that I cannot tell,\u201d said he, \u201cBut \u2019twas a famous victory. \u201d \u2014 Robert Southey \u201cThe Battle of Blenheim\u201d (1798) Southey, a pacifist, wrote his antiwar poem long after the 1704 battle for which the Duke of Marlborough was awarded Blenheim Palace, where his Winston Churchill would be born. We, however, do not need to wait 94 years to doubt whether the Trump administration\u2019s action against \u201csanctuary cities\u201d is much ado about not much. Four months have sufficed to reveal \u2019twas a constitutionally dubious gesture.",
        "Destiny Lopez is of All* Above All Action Fund. Like a steady drip from a broken faucet, a lot of blame has been thrown around since Hillary Clinton\u2019s shocking loss in November. Predictably, and without any evidence, some have begun drawing connections between Clinton\u2019s loss and her support of abortion rights, specifically her call to end the Hyde Amendment, the law first passed in 1976 that effectively denies women insurance coverage for abortion.",
        "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is one of the shrewdest politicians of his generation. But by speaking Wednesday on the Senate floor in defense of President Trump\u2019s firing of FBI Director James B. Comey, McConnell made what is likely to stand as the most important mistake of his long political career. The Kentucky Republican, who is measured and calculating about everything, should have known better. He chose to ally himself with a man who becomes unhinged whenever the subject of his campaign\u2019s possible collusion with Russian interference in our election arises.",
        "AMERICAN UNIVERSITY has been seized by racial unease since a pairs of bananas, their skins scrawled with toxic messages, were found hanging from black string nooses just after dawn early last week. The incident coincided with the ascension of the university\u2019s first African American female student government president, Taylor Dumpson, a junior, who was subsequently placed under protection by campus police after a white supremacist urged others to troll her online.",
        "President Trump is dealing with a budding scandal after firing FBI Director James B. Comey on Tuesday. But even before that, he appears to have hit a new low with the American people. A new poll from Quinnipiac University shows Trump\u2019s disapproval rating rising to 58 percent \u2014 a new high in Quinnipiac\u2019s regular polling and the highest in a poll since his inauguration. Just 36 percent approved of Trump\u2019s job performance.",
        "The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has curtailed work on a pipeline in Ohio after the owner, Energy Transfer Partners, reported 18 leaks and spilled more than 2 million gallons of drilling materials. The pipeline regulator blocked Energy Transfer Partners, which also built the controversial Dakota Access pipeline, from starting horizontal drilling in eight areas where drilling has not yet begun. In other areas, where the company has already begun horizontal drilling, the FERC said drilling could continue.",
        "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. \u2014 Graduating students booed Education Secretary Betsy DeVos as she spoke here Wednesday at University\u2019s commencement, and many turned their backs to protest her appearance at the historically black school. The speech was part of the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing effort to reach out to historically black colleges and universities. Many students and alumni had objected to having DeVos as speaker in part because they said that outreach is an empty gesture, or they were offended by a remark she made about historically black schools.",
        "They had followed him across the country and back, from one military base to another. On Wednesday, Army Staff Sgt. Mark De Alencar\u2019s wife and five children followed him one last time: six figures, dressed in black, walking behind the caisson that carried his casket through Arlington National Cemetery. As men in uniform lifted the casket off the back of the carriage and marched across the grass, the fallen soldier\u2019s son raised a small hand in salute. De Alencar, 37, was killed April 8 when his Special Forces unit clashed with Islamic State fighters in eastern Afghanistan.",
        "Wait. It\u2019s Wednesday. How is it only Wednesday? That can\u2019t be right. There are already so many details emerging out of this chaotic news cycle, and you\u2019re telling me there\u2019s three more days left before \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d airs? SNL, like the rest of comedy, has gone super heavy on the biting political humor (and unlike in prior seasons, they\u2019ve amped it up since Election Day).",
        "A Los Angeles Superior Court judge agreed to delay a deposition the former USA Gymnastics president Steve Penny was to give in relation to sex abuse allegations brought against Team USA\u2019s former physician by a former member of the team. The reason for the delay? Penny\u2019s legal team told Judge Susan that Penny needed to attend the Indianapolis 500 later this month to network to find a new job, the Orange County Register reports.",
        "The initial praise lavished on Aziz Ansari\u2019s \u201cMaster of None\u201d focused mainly on the show\u2019s original takes on race and other states of outsiderness, seen not only from the perspective of its main character, Dev Shah (Ansari) and his Indian ethnicity, but also in the slights and experienced by those within Dev\u2019s circle: immigrant parents; friends of other races and sexual orientations; a white girlfriend; and even the strangers he meets on the street.",
        "At 7:20 a. m. last Thursday, Josh Henderson was summoned to a mass casualty event at a building in downtown Galveston, Tex. He arrived to a scene unlike any he had ever witnessed. Henderson, supervisor of the animal services unit in the Galveston Police Department, quickly began collecting the bodies \u2014 dozens upon dozens of migratory birds that had evidently become disoriented and slammed into the while flying north from Central and South America during a storm the night before. Three of the birds \u2014 a Nashville warbler and two magnolia warblers \u2014 were alive.",
        "Fifty miles from Mosul\u2019s front line sits a sprawling complex of residential homes in the suburbs of Irbil, the capital of the Iraqi region of Kurdistan. Spread in rows like little ornate white boxes, these opulent villas contrast not only with the surrounding environment but Western cliches about the Middle East, says photographer Eugenio Grosso. Grosso\u2019s series \u201cIrbil White House\u201d explores the architecture of the homes built inside the gated residential complex Dream City.",
        "President Trump on Thursday said he was thinking of \u201cthis Russia thing with Trump\u201d when he decided to fire FBI Director James B. Comey, who had been leading the counterintelligence investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. Recounting his decision to dismiss Comey, Trump told NBC News, \u201cIn fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, \u2018You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story, it\u2019s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won.",
        "This post is updated with more Trump comments from his NBC News interview, airing Thursday night, in which he suggested the Russia investigation factored into his decision. Trump to NBC: \u201dWhen I decided to [fire Comey] I said to myself, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story.\u201d \u2014 Philip Rucker (@PhilipRucker) May 11, 2017 I wrote Wednesday that the White House\u2019s explanations for firing James B. Comey were crumbling. Well, President Trump just exploded them.",
        "President Trump was not subtle in his letter informing FBI Director James B. Comey that Comey was being fired. \u201cWhile I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau,\u201d it read. In an interview with NBC\u2019s Lester Holt published Thursday, we learned more about those three occasions. Once, Trump says, Comey told him he wasn\u2019t under investigation while the two were dining together; the other occasions were phone calls.",
        "Acting FBI director Andrew McCabe on Thursday rejected the Trump White House\u2019s characterization of the Russian meddling probe as a low priority and delivered a passionate defense of former director James B. Comey \u2014 putting himself squarely at odds with the president while the bureau\u2019s future hangs in the balance. McCabe, who had been the No.",
        "Senate Democrats pummeled Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein on Thursday for his involvement in the firing of FBI Director James B. Comey, warning that his nonpartisan reputation is at risk unless he starts answering questions from Congress. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( . Y.) sent Rosenstein a letter Thursday with detailed questions about his involvement in the ouster of Comey. He warned that Rosenstein\u2019s reputation as an \u201cindependent, apolitical actor\u201d is in jeopardy unless he begins sharing details.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s lengthy Twitter history has long been mined by his opponents, looking for ghosts to haunt the president with accusations of hypocrisy. He was critical of military intervention in Syria under President Barack Obama; so when as president he launched missiles at a Syrian base, those old tweets of his slamming Obama were retweeted back into relevance. On Thursday afternoon, Trump used this trick on someone else: He retweeted an old tweet from Rosie O\u2019Donnell demanding that FBI Director James Comey be fired, and commented, \u201cWe finally agree on something Rosie. \u201d We finally agree on something Rosie.",
        "It was implausible that FBI Director James Comey was fired in May 2017 for actions committed in July 2016 \u2014 the rationale contained in the memo by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. It was implausible that Comey was fired by President Trump for having been too tough on Hillary Clinton, as when, at a July news conference, Comey publicly recited her various email misdeeds despite recommending against prosecution.",
        "This was always the main question: Would President Trump go beyond mere Twitter abuse and move against institutions that limit his power? By any reasonable standard, we now have an answer. Trump\u2019s official rationale for firing FBI Director James B. Comey \u2014 that the president was suddenly seized with outrage at the shocking treatment of Hillary Clinton by the FBI during the election \u2014 is false in a typically way. It requires his supporters to demonstrate their loyalty by defending the indefensible. This is apparently the manner in which Trump identifies true believers.",
        "Philip Allen Lacovara, a former U. S. deputy solicitor general in the Justice Department, served as counsel to Watergate special prosecutors Archibald Cox and Leon Jaworski. As the senior surviving member of the Watergate special prosecutor\u2019s office from the time of the \u201cSaturday Night Massacre,\u201d it is impossible to consider the firing of FBI Director James B. Comey without recalling that fateful night. One comparison \u2014 the behavior of senior Justice Department officials in the face of presidential pressure \u2014 is disappointing.",
        "Think grade inflation has made grades less meaningful? A consortium of 100 elite prep schools agrees. But rather than impose stricter grading curves, these schools plan to eliminate grades altogether. \u201cPeople are nonstandard,\u201d says D. Scott Looney, head of Cleveland\u2019s Hawken School and founder and board chair of the new Mastery Transcript Consortium. \u201cThey grow and evolve in the world in nonstandard ways. Distilling that down to a simple common number like a GPA shaves off a lot of humanity in that journey.",
        "Possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign was once little more than a conspiracy theory, but not anymore. The only way to make sense of this week\u2019s stunning events is to conclude that there is something that President Trump desperately wants to hide. The explanation of why Trump fired FBI Director James B. Comey \u2014 that it was all about the way Comey handled the probe of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails \u2014 crumbled within hours.",
        "WE WILL be the first to acknowledge that reporters can be persistent \u201d sometimes even obnoxious \u201d in asking questions. But that, at least in the United States, has not generally been considered a crime. So it s more than a little troubling that a reporter in West Virginia was handcuffed, placed under arrest and put in jail after trying to ask a question of Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. The events unfolded Tuesday in the State Capitol in Charleston when Dan Heyman, a journalist with Public News Service, pestered Mr."
