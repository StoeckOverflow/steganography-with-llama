        "Changes to a controversial visa program under consideration by the Trump administration could hurt a real estate project partially owned by the family of White House adviser Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s . The decision, which rests with Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly, stands as an early test of how the Trump administration will handle matters that could carry significant consequences for the financial interests of the president\u2019s extended family.",
        "Sarah Huckabee Sanders tried to square an impossible circle on Thursday. It didn\u2019t help that her boss, President Trump, got in her way. With White House press secretary Sean Spicer sidelined, Sanders, Spicer\u2019s deputy, has spent three days in the barrel trying to explain why the president fired FBI Director James B. Comey. That\u2019s been no easy task. On Wednesday, Sanders told White House reporters that the president had done so on the recommendation of his deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein. Trump himself had claimed as much in a letter to Comey relieving him of his job.",
        "President Trump set his sights on the Navy in a new interview, calling the service\u2019s new electromagnetic catapult to launch planes off aircraft carriers \u201cno good\u201d and saying that the Navy needs to go back to \u201cgoddamned steam,\u201d the method used for decades. The comments, published Thursday by Time magazine, came during an interview Monday evening at the White House. Trump recounted a conversation he had March 2 while visiting the aircraft carrier Gerald L. Ford in Newport News, Va. and said that he was told the catapult on it does not have enough power.",
        "When the city of New Orleans had a memorial to Jefferson Davis torn down before daybreak Thursday, a crowd of the Confederate leader\u2019s sympathizers stood by, chanting: \u201cPresident Davis! President Davis!\u201d A man adorned with rebel flags buried his face in his hand as the statue of Davis, the man who stands for the South\u2019s lost cause, was hauled away by crane and truck. Presumably, empathizers will also stand vigil if New Orleans carries out its threat to remove the city\u2019s other rebel monuments \u2014 one of them a statue of one of his generals, P. G. T. Beauregard.",
        "Federal authorities on Thursday searched the offices of a political consulting firm in Annapolis that has worked with Republican candidates locally and nationwide and was sued in 2014 on allegations of fraudulent fundraising practices. Strategic Campaign Group says it supports Republican candidates on a range of services including mail, fundraising and telephone town halls. Its leaders include GOP strategists Kelley Rogers, Chip O\u2019Neil and Dennis Whitfield. The firm has close ties to Republican consultant Scott B.",
        "Retired Master Sgt. Wilburn K. Ross, an Army who received the Medal of Honor for fighting back eight German counterattacks during a World War II battle in France, died May 9 in Washington state. He was 94. His death was announced by the Congressional Medal of Honor Society. The cause was not disclosed. Sgt. Ross \u2014 then a private \u2014 served in the Army\u2019s storied 3rd Infantry Division during World War II and saw combat in Morocco and Italy, where he was wounded by shrapnel in 1943.",
        "KABUL \u2014 The emerging signs that the Trump administration may send thousands more U. S. troops to Afghanistan are generating a variety of reactions here, including relief at a signal of strong commitment from the new administration in Washington, and worry that it may not be enough to turn around a long, expensive war the Taliban have fought to a draw. But many Afghan observers agree on one thing: Without a complementary political policy aimed at bolstering the weak Kabul government, pressing fractious leaders to get along and fending off the country\u2019s meddlesome neighbors, no U. S.",
        "President Trump on Thursday launched a commission on \u201celection integrity,\u201d rekindling a controversy over the prevalence of voter fraud at U. S. polls. The commission, established by executive order, is the upshot of Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claim shortly after taking office that more than 3 million undocumented immigrants illegally voted in November\u2019s election. White House aides said the scope of the commission, chaired by Vice President Pence, will reach beyond allegations of voter fraud to include voter suppression and other suspect election practices, and would include members of both major political parties.",
        "The tony resort community of Sand Lake in Upstate New York roasted in heat for the third straight day on July 7, 1908, when old Hazel Irene Drew walked along a remote section of Taborton Road. Heavily wooded, this stretch out by Teal\u2019s Pond was popular with squirrel hunters, campers and fishermen looking for bait, but it was risky business for a young woman like Hazel to be alone at night. She was by all accounts a prepossessing woman, with flaxen, pompadoured hair and blue eyes. At approximately 7:30 p. m.",
        "Hackers unleashed an attack that disabled computers in dozens of nations Friday using a software flaw that once was part of the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance tool kit. The resulting wave of online chaos affected tens of thousands of machines worldwide, snarling operations at the Russian Interior Ministry, Spanish telecommunications giant Telef\u00f3nica and Britain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) where hospitals were hobbled and medical procedures interrupted. Europe, Latin America and parts of Asia were hit particularly hard, although in the United States, FedEx also reported falling prey to the malware.",
        "It was first reported in England \u2014 hackers gained access to the National Health Service computers, effectively shuttering the entire system. Patients were told to stay home; doctors and nurses were unable to access email or medical records and had to take notes by hand. The hackers demanded a ransom, to be paid in bitcoin. By Friday afternoon, though, it was clear that this was not a limited attack. Businesses in at least 11 other countries reported similar cyberattacks. Many were paralyzed. [Malware, described in leaked NSA documents, cripples computers worldwide] There\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know.",
        "Are you one of those people who ignores prompts to update your Windows system? Well, Friday\u2019s massive international cyberattack may give you the best reason of all to hit \u201cupdate\u201d when prompted. Microsoft on Friday said in a statement that it has \u201dadded detection and protection\u201d to shield Windows users against WannaCrypt \u2014 the malicious software used to attack Britain\u2019s National Health Service, FedEx and other organizations.",
        "The massive online attack on Friday that seized control of computers at hospitals, shipping firms and telecom companies around the world was totally preventable. With a few routine software updates, the security flaw linked to the attack, known as Wanna Decryptor or WannaCry, could have been addressed by information technology administrators before it had a chance to do any damage. Instead, the Windows vulnerability \u2014 which experts say is linked to the National Security Agency \u2014 has taken over thousands of personal computers, forcing their owners to pay real money or risk having their data deleted.",
        "With his own words over the past two days, President Trump has vastly escalated the stakes and potential consequences of his decision to fire James B. Comey as FBI director, provoking questions about whether his motivations and tactics may have run afoul of the law. The president also suggested via Twitter that he may have \u201ctapes\u201d of private conversations with Comey, evoking echoes of Watergate and demands by Democrats that he produce what could be critical evidence.",
        "President Trump suggested Friday that there may be \u201ctapes\u201d of his private conversations with FBI Director James B. Comey, whom he fired earlier this week, in what appeared to be an attempt to threaten Comey about \u201cleaking to the press. \u201d James Comey better hope that there are no \u201dtapes\u201d of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017 In his tweet, Trump appears to suggest that he may have recordings of his communications with Comey. But it is unclear if such tapes exist.",
        "An ethics watchdog group filed a complaint against Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Friday alleging that his participation in the firing of FBI Director James B. Comey violated Justice Department rules and Sessions\u2019s promise to recuse himself from matters involving Russia. \u201cFiring the lead investigator is the most extreme form of interfering with an investigation,\u201d wrote Fred Wertheimer, who signed the complaint on behalf of his organization, Democracy 21. The filing asked the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility to investigate the matter and issue a public report \u2014 and to take additional action.",
        "Throughout Donald Trump\u2019s business career, some executives who came to work for him were taken aside by colleagues and warned to assume that their discussions with the boss were being recorded. \u201cThere was never any sense with Donald of the phone being used for private conversation,\u201d said John O\u2019Donnell, who was president of the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in the 1980s. For O\u2019Donnell and others who have had regular dealings with Trump through the years, there was something viscerally real about the threat implied by the president\u2019s tweet Friday morning warning that fired FBI director James B.",
        "Once again, Vice President Pence was out on a limb. A day after President Trump fired FBI Director James B. Comey, his vice president stared into a television camera, surrounded by a gaggle of reporters on Capitol Hill, and cited the president\u2019s decision to rely on the counsel of his advisers as proof of his \u201cstrong\u201d leadership. \u201cPresident Trump made the right decision at the right time to accept the recommendation of the deputy attorney general and the attorney general to ask for the termination\u201d of Comey, Pence said. But that wasn\u2019t true.",
        "Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.) the Senate Republican, who has in recent weeks become a more outward defender of President Trump, and acting FBI director Andrew McCabe, who on Thursday contradicted the Trump White House on a range of topics, will interview Saturday to serve as the FBI\u2019s permanent director, according to people familiar with the matter. The men are two of at least four people who will interview to replace James B. Comey, whom Trump suddenly fired this week, the people said.",
        "John Podesta, the chair of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, served as counselor to President Barack Obama and chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. Are you searching for a common thread for all the craziness emanating from President Trump\u2019s White House during the past week? To review: On Monday, the American people received the stunning disclosure that on Jan. 26, acting attorney general Sally Yates warned White House Counsel Donald McGahn that national security adviser Michael Flynn had been seriously compromised by his communications with the Russian ambassador and subsequent lies about those communications.",
        "William Barr was U. S. attorney general from 1991 to 1993. Having served as both attorney general and deputy attorney general in the Justice Department, I had responsibility for supervising the FBI, working on virtually a daily basis with its senior leadership. From that experience I came to understand how fortunate we are as a nation to have in the FBI the finest organization in the world \u2014 one that is thoroughly professional and free of partisanship. I offer this perspective on President Trump\u2019s removal of FBI Director James B. Comey.",
        "Facts aren\u2019t facts; truth isn\u2019t true; reality isn\u2019t real. This is where we are. It\u2019s no wonder that \u201cOrwellian\u201d is the most widely used adjective derived from the name of a writer. We are living in the most surreal of times. But Orwell\u2019s days may be numbered as \u201cTrumpian\u201d has swiftly emerged to describe the president\u2019s apparent intent to Orwell\u2019s dystopian vision. Either that, or he\u2019s just plain addled. Or, it must be considered, the alien being that has inhabited the former Donald Trump\u2019s body has been slow to absorb the intricacies and nuances of the spoken word.",
        "In July 1954, a Memphis truck driver recorded at Sun Studio the song \u201cThat\u2019s All Right. \u201d When a local disc jockey promised to play it, the truck driver tuned his parents\u2019 radio to the station and went to a movie. His mother pulled him from the theater because the DJ was playing the record repeatedly and wanted to interview the singer immediately. The DJ asked where the singer had gone to high school. He answered, \u201cHumes,\u201d an school. The DJ asked because many callers \u201cwho like your record think you must be colored, singing the way you do.",
        "\u201cWhen will they storm Washington\u2019s Monticello?\u201d Laura Ingraham asked ominously this last week. The conservative commentator\u2019s tweet linked to news that a statue of Jefferson Davis, one of four contested monuments in New Orleans, was slated to come down Wednesday night. The question was met with derision, and a subsequent correction from Ingraham \u2014 George Washington lived at Mount Vernon, Monticello was Thomas Jefferson\u2019s estate, and neither of those Founding Fathers ever interacted with Davis, the president of the Confederacy.",
        "THE NEWS this week emerged in such fits and starts, and with such shifting explanations, that its grave implications may not have sunk in for many Americans. It is worth reviewing what we know: (1) President Trump fired the director of the FBI, in the fourth year of his term, because the president was upset that Mr. Comey was leading an FBI investigation of possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign in 2016. The investigation was gaining momentum as Mr. Trump struck. (2) Mr.",

        "Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Friday that he has directed his federal prosecutors to pursue the most severe penalties possible, including mandatory minimum sentences, in his first step toward a return to the war on drugs of the 1980s and 1990s that resulted in long sentences for many minority defendants and packed U. S. prisons. Civil rights groups, Republican lawmakers and even the conservative Koch brothers issued swift condemnations of the policy, saying that Sessions was taking the nation backward. Aggressive prosecutors, however, are likely to embrace the measure as giving them more tools to do their jobs.",
        "In a church hall in Northern Virginia, a father of two named Jose sat at a long table and stared at the legal document before him. It was a road map for life without him.
