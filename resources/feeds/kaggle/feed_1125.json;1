        "An Ohio police chief and two nursing home employees were shot and killed Friday morning in a small community outside Columbus by a gunman, who was later found dead, authorities said. Licking County Sheriff Randy Thorp said at a news conference that Kirkersville Police Chief Steven Eric Disario was responding to a call about a man with a gun. When deputies arrived on the scene, he said, they found Disario\u2019s body in the street, then found the gunman and two female nursing home employees dead inside the nearby Pine Kirk Care Center.",
        "The presence of a Russian photographer working for a news agency during President Trump\u2019s meeting with Russian diplomats in the Oval Office on Wednesday sparked criticism from media advocates, as well as concerns over the risk of a security breach. White House officials seemed caught off guard by the controversy, initially saying they had not anticipated that the state news agency Tass would post photographs from the meeting. \u201cThey tricked us,\u201d one unnamed official was quoted as saying by CNN. In response, Russian officials have fired back fiercely \u2014 by taking aim at the U. S. media.",
        "Before being assembled into something recognizable at a museum, most dinosaur fossils look to the casual observer like nothing more than common rocks. No one, however, would confuse the over 110 nodosaur fossil for a stone. The fossil, being unveiled today in Canada\u2019s Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology, is so well preserved it looks like a statue. Even more surprising might be its accidental discovery, as unveiled in the June issue of National Geographic magazine.",
        "In deciding to abruptly fire FBI Director James B. Comey, President Trump characteristically let himself be guided by his own instincts \u2014 fueled by his creeping anger and sense of victimhood about a probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election that he considers a \u201cwitch hunt. \u201d The aftermath is a presidency rocked by its most serious crisis yet, exposing dysfunction and distrust within his West Wing and imperiling his agenda.",
        "The possible ties between President Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia could face greater scrutiny on Capitol Hill after the president publicly contradicted the reason he gave congressional leaders for the decision to fire FBI Director James B. Comey. Trump said Thursday he was thinking of \u201cthis Russia thing with Trump\u201d when he resolved to fire Comey, whose agency is leading an investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the presidential election.",
        "TOKYO \u2014 North Korea fired a ballistic missile early Sunday, sending it from a launch site near its border with China some 450 miles into the sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. It was launched from the same site where North Korea fired two mystery missiles that some analysts thought could have been intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the mainland United States. But the U. S. military said that the flight pattern was \u201cnot consistent\u201d with an ICBM and did not threaten the United States.",
        "The women of the Palm Beach Habilitation Center had whispered among themselves that President Trump might pop in for their Luncheon at Trump\u2019s luxurious private club. \u201cIt was Presidents\u2019 Day at the president\u2019s house and the president was in town. Then, by golly, he showed up,\u201d said Tina Philips, president of the center, a charity that provides job training and other services to adults with disabilities. \u201cHe took the microphone and talked to the group and the ladies all went wild. He was in a very supportive crowd.",
        "It\u2019s been a week since political outsider Emmanuel Macron won the French presidential election. But his wife, Brigitte Macron, has continued to face a litany of misogynistic comments similar to ones that plagued her throughout the campaign, most centering on the couple\u2019s age difference. The satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo on Tuesday published a cover with caricatures of the incoming French president and his wife, along with the caption: \u201dHe is going to work miracles!\u201d The text was a reference to Macron\u2019s optimistic campaign messaging in a divisive election.",
        "Laurence H. Tribe is Carl M. Loeb University Professor and Professor of Constitutional Law at Harvard Law School. The time has come for Congress to launch an impeachment investigation of President Trump for obstruction of justice. The remedy of impeachment was designed to create a mechanism for preserving our constitutional system. It operates by removing officials who have so abused power through what the framers called \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d that they cannot be trusted to continue in office.",
        "The mother was serious as she approached the principal of her daughter\u2019s D. C. school. Would the principal consider becoming her child\u2019s legal guardian in the event she was deported, so her daughter, a U. S. citizen, could stay in the country? It was a surreal question but one rooted in real fear. The political rhetoric about immigration, along with enforcement actions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has instilled palpable anxiety in immigrant families across the country, elevating a background level of uncertainty to an urgent concern. In the days after an ICE raid in Las Cruces, N. M.",
        "Officials in nearly 100 countries raced Saturday to contain one of the biggest cybersecurity attacks in recent history, as British doctors were forced to cancel operations, Chinese students were blocked from accessing their graduation theses, and passengers at train stations in Germany were greeted by hacked arrival and departure screens. Companies and organizations around the world potentially faced substantial costs after hackers threatened to keep computers disabled unless victims paid $300 or more in ransom, the latest and most brazen in a type of cyberattack known as \u201cransomware.",
        "The Trump administration is planning to nominate Sam Clovis \u2014 the Department of Agriculture\u2019s senior White House adviser \u2014 as head of USDA\u2019s Research, Education and Economics division, according to individuals briefed on the decision. The move would mark a break with recent Republican and Democratic administrations alike, which have previously reserved the position for scientists with expertise in agricultural research.",
        "College graduation season is in full swing, with celebrities and politicians delivering impassioned, heartening and funny commencement speeches to the Class of 2017. This year\u2019s exercises cap off a year marked by political tensions on and off campuses across the country. And President Trump and criticisms of his administration\u2019s policies were a key feature of many addresses. [At Howard University graduation, Trump administration policies loom large] At Howard University\u2019s commencement Saturday, Sen. Kamala D. Harris ( .) criticized the administration\u2019s stance on immigration, health care and law enforcement.",
        "LYNCHBURG, Va. \u2014 After one of the most tumultuous weeks of his presidency, President Trump traveled to Liberty University on Saturday morning to deliver a subdued pep talk. For once, it was not a campaign speech \u2014 although he did marvel at the large crowd and bragged about his success with evangelical voters. Instead, the president explained to graduates of the evangelical Christian school how to stay tough when no one agrees with you, when everyone is criticizing you, when you feel like running home to your mother. \u201cNothing worth doing ever, ever, ever came easy,\u201d the president said.",
        "SAN FERNANDO, Calif. \u2014 May was supposed to be dead by now. The pit bull mix had languished for more than two months at a animal shelter in east Los Angeles County, and though she\u2019d passed one \u201ctemperament test\u201d required for adoption, she failed a second. That essentially put her on death row at the facility. But a small rescue group got to May first and reserved her a spot on a school bus that would take her 840 miles north to Eugene, Ore.; there, another rescue had pledged to find her a home.",
        "What do you do when you know someone is going to die? I\u2019m not talking about death when it comes at the end of a long protracted illness or a terminal diagnosis. Or the final act at the end of a long life, when the body and mind have ultimately given way. I\u2019m talking about when you realize the woman in front of you, whom you met five minutes ago, has no idea she will not survive to see another sunrise.",
        "Although Ella Mae Formel works full time in Great Barrington, Mass. money is tight for the new mother. Her baby, Oliver, was born at the end of March, and making sure she had everything she needed to take care of him was important to her. So when she read a newspaper article before his birth about a program offering free baby boxes, she jumped at the opportunity.",
        "It all began with an innocent joke. Anita Barnes was a junior at George Washington University when she and her roommate, Fran, decided to play a phone prank on a friend from class. This was 1966, a time when phone calls still retained some of their mystery: You couldn\u2019t know who was calling \u2014 and certainly not why \u2014 unless you picked up. For several days, Anita and Fran played their little game \u2014 dialing, giggling and hanging up before the voice on the other end had a chance to say anything.",
        "This recipe turns a humble bowl of rice into a tasty meal. It feels like an indulgence, but the dish is actually good for you. The bowl is brimming with colorful spring vegetables \u2014 asparagus, peas and carrots \u2014 that are with scallion, ginger, garlic and a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes. The aroma gets your mouth watering the second those flavors hit the skillet. Then you add the rice and continue to cook until it is all warmed through.",
        "When I was 17 years old, I lied to my mother. I told her that I was sleeping over at my friend Kristof\u2019s house when, in fact, Kristof and I slept in the street, in my mom\u2019s car, so that we could attend a midnight performance of the most outre band to play our town in 1982. Wendy O. Williams and the Plasmatics routinely dynamited televisions to smithereens onstage. The singer, Wendy O. sported a blue mohawk and often greeted audiences wearing a dollop of shaving cream around her scrawny midriff.",
        "Russia has yet to collect much of what it hoped for from the Trump administration, including the lifting of U. S. sanctions and recognition of its annexation of Crimea. But the Kremlin has collected a different return on its effort to help elect Trump in last year\u2019s election: chaos in Washington. The president\u2019s decision to fire FBI Director James B. Comey last week was the latest destabilizing jolt to a core institution of the U. S. government. The nation\u2019s top law enforcement agency joined a list of entities that Trump has targeted, including federal judges, U. S.",
        "In the six days since President Trump abruptly fired FBI director James B. Comey, concern from both parties has mounted about the selection of a replacement and the president\u2019s suggestion that he may have secretly taped conversations with the ousted director.",
        "The Trump administration has removed or tucked away a wide variety of information that until recently was provided to the public, limiting access, for instance, to disclosures about workplace violations, energy efficiency, and animal welfare abuses. Some of the information relates to enforcement actions taken by federal agencies against companies and other employers. By lessening access, the administration is sheltering them from the kind of \u201cnaming and shaming\u201d that federal officials previously used to influence company behavior, according to digital experts, activists and former Obama administration officials.",
        "BALTIMORE \u2014 No one saw the baby. She sat in a car with tinted black windows as her father lay on the ground outside, dying. All eyes were on him, another fallen body in a city increasingly defined by them. In portions of Baltimore, the strobe of police cars is as much a part of the landscape as homes. But the pace of the killings this year has been stunning as the city struggles to recover from rioting in 2015.",
        "BLANDING, Utah \u2014 Long after the Black Hawk helicopter carrying Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke flew off into the bright Utah sky, James Adakai stood in the airport parking lot with an angry frown frozen on his face. As chairman of a tribal commission established to oversee the Bears Ears National Monument, Adakai, who is Navajo, felt he deserved a place in a meeting Zinke arranged at the airport to discuss the monument\u2019s fate. Instead, Zinke met and toured the site in helicopters with Utah government officials and others who adamantly oppose the first U. S.",
        "Preet Bharara, a scholar in residence at New York University Law School, was U. S. attorney for the Southern District of New York from 2009 until this March. The most dramatic hearing I helped to arrange as chief counsel to a Senate subcommittee took place 10 years ago Monday, when James B. Comey, then deputy attorney general in the George W. Bush administration, described how he and FBI Director Robert Mueller intervened at the hospital bedside of Attorney General John Ashcroft. The encounter occurred in 2004, after White House Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr.",
        "Donald Trump has made it clear enough that he has no interest in pursuing the traditional U. S. human rights strategy of pressuring foreign regimes, including U. S. allies, to release political prisoners, stop torture or allow free elections. But what about an America First campaign to deter other governments from mistreating or unjustly imprisoning U. S. citizens \u2014 in some cases, simply because they are Americans? A bit haphazardly, the Trump administration has already made a start at such a policy. If it wants to build on it, there is plenty of opportunity.",
        "President Trump\u2019s opponents have spent his administration\u2019s first months engaged in an unusual but important debate: Is Trump a problem because he is incompetent or because he harbors autocratic designs that threaten American democracy itself? At the end of his first 100 days, the debate was tilting toward ineptitude. Trump didn\u2019t know or care much about policy, shifted from one issue position to another, shunned eloquence in favor of tweeting and didn\u2019t even bother filling hundreds of government jobs.",
        "Globalization has gotten a bad rap. The Trump White House associates it with all manner of economic evil, especially job loss. The administration has made undoing the damage a central part of its economic strategy. This will almost certainly fail and disappoint, because globalization\u2019s ill effects have been wildly exaggerated. A new report shows why. It comes from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank. Granted, Peterson is widely known for its views, so its support for globalization is no surprise. Still, it gives both sides of the story, and the numbers speak for themselves.",
        "SHANE PARIS SISSOKO was three months old when he was murdered in Montgomery County in 2001. Lemuel Wallace, 37, blind and developmentally disabled, was shot to death in 2009 in a Baltimore park. Latiqua Cherry, a Prince George\u2019s mother, was stabbed nine times before her body was set on fire in May 2015. Prince McLeod Rams was 15 months old when he was drowned or suffocated in Virginia in October 2012. Common to all of these deaths is that the killer had secretly insured the victims\u2019 lives and made themselves sole beneficiaries."
