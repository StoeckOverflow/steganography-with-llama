When people think of the Netherlands, a few stereotypes come to mind: Amsterdam\u2019s canals, tulips, relaxed policies around soft drugs and sex work, euthanasia and, of course, the Dutch tolerance.

        "TOKYO \u2014 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un celebrated a test of the \u201cperfect weapon system\u201d after his engineers launched what they said was a new kind of ballistic missile system capable of carrying \u201ca heavy nuclear warhead. \u201d The missile, launched Sunday morning, appeared to show substantial progress toward developing an intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the mainland United States, U. S. rocket scientists said. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s latest successful missile test represents a level of performance never before seen from a North Korean missile,\u201d said John Schilling, an aerospace engineer who specializes in rockets.",
        "RICHMOND \u2014 white nationalist Richard Spencer led a large group of demonstrators carrying torches and chanting \u201cYou will not replace us\u201d Saturday in Charlottesville, protesting plans to remove a Confederate monument that has played an outsize role in this year\u2019s race for Virginia governor. \u201cWhat brings us together is that we are white, we are a people, we will not be replaced,\u201d Spencer said at an afternoon protest, the first of two rallies he led in the town where he once attended the University of Virginia.",
        "Journalism has been called the first rough draft of history, but last week it felt more like an doodle on Snapchat \u2014 scribbled in one frantic instant only to disappear the next. The media world was blown off its axis as President Trump fired FBI Director James B. Comey on Tuesday, unleashing a hurricane of assertions, counterclaims, obfuscations and threats. The news cycle, once a stately 24 hours, was reduced to mere seconds. It was hard for dizzied news consumers to know what, or whom, to believe. That\u2019s bad. Worse yet is they may decide it\u2019s not worth caring.",
        "When James B. Comey woke up Tuesday, he was the director of the FBI, leading an effort to determine whether President Trump\u2019s campaign may have colluded with Russia to meddle in the 2016 presidential election. By the end of that day, Comey was out of a job. The frantic hours in between \u2014 especially just after the president abruptly fired Comey \u2014 have been heavily scrutinized. Why exactly was Comey fired? How and when did Trump arrive at that decision? And who could make sense of the White House\u2019s conflicting explanations for the firing?",
        "The malicious \u201cransomware\u201d attacks that seized computers worldwide Friday and held those systems hostage are likely to worsen this week as millions of people return to work \u2014 forcing them to discover the hard way whether they have been affected, security analysts said. With much of the world still reeling from the digital breach that prevented people from receiving hospital care, a second wave of what European officials have called \u201cthe biggest ransomware attack ever\u201d could be devastating.",
        "If it weren\u2019t for George Conway, the nation might never have met Monica Lewinsky, and Donald Trump might never have met Kellyanne. In the 1990s, George was a quiet but critical presence in what Hillary Clinton would dub a \u201cvast conspiracy\u201d \u2014 a hotshot young attorney working to undermine President Bill Clinton by offering secret legal aid to his accusers and reportedly funneling salacious details to the Drudge Report. \u201cThis one disgruntled New York lawyer almost brought down the president,\u201d David Brock, the conservative acolyte, later wrote.",
        "One recent morning in the countryside beyond London, Kinda Haddad dropped her two children off at school, came home and began scanning her computer for the day\u2019s first reports of Syrian civilians killed by American bombs. Outside her living room window, a willow tree was swaying in the breeze. Inside, Haddad was staring at a computer screen full of ghostly images of dead children, dusty and bloodied corpses and pile after pile of rubble. She kept the volume low. \u201cI try not to listen because it makes the images more disturbing,\u201d she said.",
        "SEOUL \u2014 The South Korean capital is not famed for its aesthetics. Built up quickly during the country\u2019s astonishingly fast industrialization, it\u2019s often been derided with the saying: There\u2019s no soul in Seoul. But the city has a new initiative to change that: Seoullo, or Seoul Street, an elevated urban walkway similar to New York\u2019s famed High Line. Built on a stretch of highway overpass that had been destined for demolition, Seoullo 7017 is to open on Saturday.",
        "President Trump revealed highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador in a White House meeting last week, according to current and former U. S. officials, who said Trump\u2019s disclosures jeopardized a critical source of intelligence on the Islamic State. The information the president relayed had been provided by a U. S. partner through an arrangement considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the U. S. government, officials said.",
        "Lawmakers expressed shock and concern after learning that President Trump had revealed highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador during a meeting in the Oval Office last week, according to current and former U. S. officials. \u201cObviously, they are in a downward spiral right now and have got to figure out a way to come to grips with all that\u2019s happening,\u201d Sen. Bob Corker ( .) chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said of the Trump administration.",
        "Donald Trump is president today in large part because of voters\u2019 concerns about protecting classified material. There are several layers of nuance to that point, of course, including that those concerns were generally a subset of critiques of Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private server as secretary of state. But the sticking point for conservative critics of Clinton\u2019s behavior was that her use of a private server included the transmission of classified information, per the FBI \u2014 thereby putting that information at risk of being intercepted by foreign agents, should her server have been compromised.",
        "As the White House was engulfed by a crisis of its own making \u2014 the abrupt firing of the FBI director \u2014 President Trump received an unlikely visitor: Henry Kissinger, the Republican Party\u2019s leading elder statesman, who came to deliver a tutorial on foreign affairs last Wednesday ahead of the president\u2019s first overseas trip. Kissinger was not alone. In the days leading up to Trump\u2019s debut on the world stage \u2014 a tour \u2014 the Oval Office has morphed into a graduate seminar room, with a rotating roster of policy experts briefing the president.",
        "The Syrian government has constructed and is using a crematorium at its notorious Sednaya military prison near Damascus to clandestinely dispose of the bodies of prisoners it continues to execute inside the facility, the State Department said Monday. Thousands of executed detainees have been dumped in mass graves in recent years, said acting assistant secretary of state Stuart Jones. \u201cWhat we\u2019re assessing is that if you have that level of production of mass murder, then using the crematorium would . . . allow the regime to manage that number of corpses . . . without evidence.",
        "There is a growing obstacle standing in the way of Sen. John Cornyn ( .) becoming the next director of the FBI \u2014 his own Republican colleagues. Led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) a chorus of GOP senators has signaled that they would prefer President Trump to nominate somebody other than the Republican senator, despite his status as a and influential figure on Capitol Hill. Their message: It\u2019s nothing personal.",
        "The appalling truth about the Trump administration can be found in something Maya Angelou once said to Oprah Winfrey: \u201cMy dear, when people show you who they are, why don\u2019t you believe them? Why must you be shown 29 times before you can see who they really are?\u201d The chaos and dysfunction we have seen since Jan. 20 constitute, I fear, the new normal. Anyone holding out hope for some magical transition from lunacy into sanity will surely be disappointed. President Trump has shown the nation who he is.",
        "I\u2019m often asked if I think President Trump will make it through all four years of his term. My stock reply: The better question is whether we will survive the next four years. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all if he does make it to 2020 without impeachment, or the 25th Amendment, blocking his path. Trump has a long history of walking out of disasters unscathed. It\u2019s those around him \u2014 the Sean Spicers of the world \u2014 who are destroyed. Alas, poor Spicer! I knew him well.",
        "The Post reports on a stunning development: President Trump revealed highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador in a White House meeting last week, according to current and former U. S. officials, who said that Trump\u2019s disclosures jeopardized a critical source of intelligence on the Islamic State. The information Trump relayed had been provided by a U. S. partner through an arrangement considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the U. S. government, officials said.",
        "President Trump told a whopper about his tax plan this month. But it\u2019s not the one that everyone is focusing on. In an interview with the Economist, Trump said his expensive proposal to cut taxes was akin to \u201cpriming the pump,\u201d a phrase he declared he\u2019d invented just a few days earlier. Lots of commenters, critics and comedians pounced on this coinage claim. They noted not only that the expression \u201cpriming the pump\u201d was in use a century ago, but also that Trump himself uttered the phrase many times before the date he claimed to have devised it.",
        "Fethullah Gulen is an Islamic scholar, preacher and social advocate. SAYLORSBURG, Pa. As the presidents of the United States and Turkey meet at the White House on Tuesday, the leader of the country I have called home for almost two decades comes face to face with the leader of my homeland. The two countries have a lot at stake, including the fight against the Islamic State, the future of Syria and the refugee crisis.",
        "PRESIDENT TRUMP\u2019S firing of FBI Director James B. Comey has rattled Washington. Mr. Trump\u2019s admission that the Russia investigation was a motivating factor has legal scholars debating whether he obstructed justice. Fresh polling shows that the public is confused and wary of the direction Mr. Trump is heading. The Democrats are contemplating a war over the Comey firing, using the Senate\u2019s many opportunities for obstruction to slow an already lethargic legislative process. All of which points to the need for a new FBI director who is universally recognized as credible and above partisanship.",
        "The Supreme Court will not consider reinstating the 2013 North Carolina voting law that a lower court ruled discriminated against African American voters, the justices said Monday. A unanimous panel of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit had found in 2016 that North Carolina legislators had acted \u201cwith almost surgical precision\u201d to blunt the influence of African American voters. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.",
        "The federal appeals court panel weighing President Trump\u2019s travel ban focused acutely on Trump\u2019s own comments at a hearing Monday \u2014 lobbing skeptical inquiries at lawyers on both sides of the issue as they tried to ascertain to what extent they should hold the president\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric against him. On the campaign trail, Trump promised a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d of Muslims entering the United States, and the three judges with the U. S.",
        "This post has been updated with comments from the White House about handing over the tapes. Top Democrats and Republicans in Congress may say they want to get their hands on any tapes President Trump may have made of his conversations with FBI Director James B. Comey, which could lend clues as to why Trump fired him. And if the president won\u2019t hand them over, Congress could force him to. But almost no one in Congress seems willing to take that step.",
        "Between rounds of jeering that interrupted his every sentence, Rep. Rod Blum ( ) took a little more than two minutes to explain what else he\u2019d like to change about the law now that he has voted for the GOP\u2019s partial repeal of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cGet rid of some of these crazy regulations that Obamacare puts in,\u201d Blum suggested at an Iowa town hall meeting Monday, \u201csuch as a male having to have pregnancy insurance. \u201d The crowd yelled all the louder.",
        "RICHMOND \u2014 Ed Gillespie has a commanding lead in the race for the Republican nomination for Virginia governor, with more than double the support of either of his rivals, according to a new Washington School poll. The former chairman of the Republican National Committee enjoys stronger support in nearly all regions of the state and among various demographic groups than either of the two other Republican candidates. Overall, 38 percent of likely Republican voters favor Gillespie in the June 13 primary, compared with 18 percent for Prince William County supervisor Corey Stewart and 15 percent for state Sen.",
        "By the time Melissa McCarthy hosted this weekend\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d she had already become a highly anticipated presence on the show for one reason: \u201cSpicey. \u201d Her take on White House press secretary Sean Spicer, which debuted in February, has become a standout moment for this season of the NBC show, helping to draw record viewers and even reportedly unsettling the president himself so much that Spicer\u2019s longevity in the job became questioned.",
        "John Wall saved the Wizards\u2019 season in Game 6, plain and simple. Now one game will decide this series of funeral attire and spilled blood. Will the momentum generated by Wall\u2019s heroics carry over to Monday\u2019s Game 7 in Boston, a place in which Washington seemingly cannot win? Or will the Celtics again defend their home floor?

        "The city of Philadelphia sued Wells Fargo on Monday for allegedly discriminating against minority home buyers. The complaint filed in a federal court in Pennsylvania alleges that Wells Fargo violated the Fair Housing Act of 1968 by \u201csteering\u201d minority borrowers into mortgages that were more expensive and riskier than those offered to white borrowers, according to court documents. The lawsuit says that Wells Fargo is among the major banks with a \u201chistory of redlining\u201d in Philadelphia, a practice traced back to the 1930s that involves denying credit to borrowers in certain communities because of their race or ethnicity.",
        "PARIS \u2014 On his first full day on the job, French President Emmanuel Macron appointed a former political foe as prime minister and flew to Berlin to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Domestically and internationally, the moves were seen as attempts by Macron to build a broader base for the untested political movement that brought him to power and to affirm his commitment to restoring the historical alliance at the heart of the European Union. Macron\u2019s campaign was marked by its unabashedly . U."
