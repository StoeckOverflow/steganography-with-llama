        "Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski dished some dirt Monday about counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway, claiming that she used to complain privately about representing a man she did not always believe in. \u201cThis is a woman, by the way, who came on our show during the campaign and would shill for Trump in extensive fashion, and then she would get off the air, the camera would be turned off, the microphone would be taken off, and she would say, \u2018Blech. I need to take a shower,\u2019 \u201d Brzezinski said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.",
        "(Ulrik Hasemann and Mathias Svold) (Ulrik Hasemann and Mathias Svold) About 1, 000 refugees and migrants sleep in abandoned warehouses, train wagons and shacks behind the central train station in Serbia\u2019s capital, Belgrade. Heaps of garbage and feces pile up next to the blankets that have been their home for the past months. Almost all of them are boys and young men from parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan. To keep warm, they make fires out of garbage and railway sleepers. One can smell the toxic smoke hundreds of yards from the train station, where life goes on unaffected.",

Comey instead to pursue reporters in leak investigations \u2014 according to private notes taken by Comey \u2014 people familiar with the matter said. According to a set of notes written by Comey following a February meeting with the president, they said, Trump brought up the counterintelligence investigation into Flynn and urged Comey to drop the probe in the wake of the national security adviser\u2019s resignation.",
        "Ten days ago, Donald Trump\u2019s rocky presidency was in relatively calm waters. He\u2019d helped push a bill through the House and was spending the weekend at his property in Bedminster, N. J. After that, the deluge: Sally Yates\u2019s testimony on Capitol Hill, the firing of FBI Director James B. Comey, the private meeting with Russia\u2019s foreign minister, the revelation that the Comey firing was spurred at least partly by the Russia investigation, the threat to release tapes of his conversation with Comey and, on Monday, The Washington Post\u2019s revelation that Trump had shared classified information with the Russians.",
        "The headline blared in : SABOTAGE. The urgent missive hit inboxes of President Trump\u2019s supporters (and reporters) just minutes after a second damaging story in 24 hours was published, this one alleging that fired FBI Director James B. Comey wrote memos saying that Trump asked him to drop the FBI investigation into Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Just a day earlier, the White House sought to push back on a report in The Washington Post that Trump revealed classified information to the Russians in an Oval Office meeting last week.",
        "The White House offered shifting explanations for President Trump\u2019s disclosure of highly classified information to senior Russian diplomats last week, a scattered defense that began with an early morning Trump tweet that he had the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to share \u201cfacts. \u201d Administration officials went from denouncing The Washington Post article as \u201cfalse\u201d to either confirming or declining to challenge nearly every key aspect of the account, which described how Trump\u2019s sharing of sensitive details about a terrorist plot jeopardized access to a stream of intelligence from a critical U. S. ally.",
        "A growing number of Republican and Democratic lawmakers are calling on President Trump to hand over the transcript of the White House meeting last week in which he revealed highly classified information to Russia\u2019s foreign minister and ambassador, according to current and former U. S. officials. Members of Congress \u2014 primarily Democrats \u2014 have spent several days demanding that Trump turn over tapes of White House meetings after he suggested, while defending his decision to fire FBI Director James B. Comey, that he records his conversations.",
        "Intelligence officials say President Trump might have damaged relations with allies, who will now be more cautious in sharing sensitive information with the United States. Democrats say he\u2019s a hypocrite, having lambasted Hillary Clinton for her own handling of classified information. But when Trump spoke about highly classified information with Russian officials in a White House meeting last week, he did not break the law, legal analysts say. The president is essentially the ultimate arbiter of what is classified and what is not.",
        "As President Trump lurches from one crisis to another, Republicans have chosen a strategy of compartmentalization over confrontation. It is a survival mechanism, one that comes with no guarantee of ultimate success but with significant risks attached. It was just more than a year ago that Trump emerged from the primaries as the Republicans\u2019 presumptive presidential nominee, having bested the favored candidates of the party establishment. Ever since, those in the establishment, including many elected officials, have grappled with the terms of what has always been an uncomfortable bargain.",

Comey and giving away classified secrets to Russian officials, just to name two \u2014 Democrats are starting to use the \u201ci\u201d word more and more. \u201cIt is a looming constitutional crisis because it involves a potential confrontation as did Watergate between the president and other branches of government,\u201d Sen.

        "If there were two words the White House wanted you to take away from national security adviser H. R.

He said no fewer than nine times that Trump\u2019s disclosure was \u201dwholly appropriate.\u201d And how do we know it was appropriate? Apparently the answer to that question is: because Trump said it.",
        "When the National Security Agency began using a new hacking tool called EternalBlue, those entrusted with deploying it marveled at both its uncommon power and the widespread havoc it could wreak if it ever got loose. Some officials even discussed whether the flaw was so dangerous they should reveal it to Microsoft, the company whose software the government was exploiting, according to former NSA employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the issue.",
        "So why did the president ask his vice president and attorney general to leave the room? The New York Times reports \u2014 and the Washington Post and other news organizations confirm \u2014 that President Trump, at a meeting with Director James B. Comey the day after national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned, asked Vice President Pence and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to leave him and Comey alone in the Oval Office.

In November, a few days before the election, I tried to parse Donald Trump\u2019s strange affection for Vladimir Putin and the various contacts that members of his campaign had had with folks in Russia. The best explanation I could come up with was something the Russians call polezni durak, the \u201cuseful fool.",
        "National security adviser H. R. McMaster had been cut off at the knees, but somehow he managed to make himself visible above the lectern in the White House briefing room Tuesday. The night before, he had declared \u201cfalse\u201d a Post report that President Trump had given highly classified information to Russia, saying \u201cit didn\u2019t happen. \u201d But Trump himself acknowledged in a tweet Tuesday morning that it did happen, saying he had \u201cthe absolute right\u201d to share \u201cfacts\u201d with Russia.

        "What would it take for Republican politicians to finally turn on, or even gently criticize, the current president? For context, here\u2019s an example of righteous fury one Republican congressman levied at President Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama. \u201cThere\u2019s no way any of us can excuse what the president did yesterday,\u201d said Peter King ( .

        "Sen. John Cornyn ( .) removed himself from consideration to be the next FBI director Tuesday, becoming the latest possibility to bow out. The Republican senator announced his decision following two days of resistance from his Republican colleagues to the idea of him filling the post. \u201cNow more than ever the country needs a independent FBI Director. I\u2019ve informed the Administration that I\u2019m committed to helping them find such an individual, and that the best way I can serve is continuing to fight for a conservative agenda in the U. S.
