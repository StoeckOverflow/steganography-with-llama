        "The world spins faster these days, but in Washington, as President Trump is now learning, the essential chemistry of crisis \u2014 quick to boil, difficult to dampen \u2014 hasn\u2019t changed in four decades. Tom Railsback, one of the last surviving members of the House Judiciary Committee that voted to impeach Richard M. Nixon, recalls the moment he knew he and his party finally had to break with their wayward president. \u201cI personally liked Richard Nixon,\u201d said Railsback, a Republican from Illinois who is now 85. \u201cHe campaigned for me.",
        "KIEV, Ukraine \u2014 A month before Donald Trump clinched the Republican nomination, one of his closest allies in Congress \u2014 House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy \u2014 made a politically explosive assertion in a private conversation on Capitol Hill with his fellow GOP leaders: that Trump could be the beneficiary of payments from Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cThere\u2019s two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump,\u201d McCarthy ( .) said, according to a recording of the June 15, 2016, exchange, which was listened to and verified by The Washington Post. Rep.",
        "As President Trump manages his latest crises, he is turning to strategies from his tumultuous business career: rely on family and a few trusted advisers, demand absolute loyalty from those beyond the inner circle, threaten opponents with legal action, and insist on briefings. But the tactics that Trump believed served him so well in business may be adding to his wounds as a special prosecutor prepares to launch an investigation into allegations that Russia sought to influence the 2016 election. Trump\u2019s family has no government background, and most of his most trusted advisers never worked in a White House.",
        "As President Trump addressed 195 cadets as they graduated from the U. S. Coast Guard Academy on Wednesday, he offered them some advice. \u201cOver the course of your life, you will find that things are not always fair,\u201d the unsmiling president said, leaning heavily on the lectern with his shoulders scrunched up. \u201cYou will find that things happen to you that you do not deserve and that are not always warranted. But you have to put your head down and fight, fight, fight. Never, ever, ever give up.",
        "No Democrat was in more demand Wednesday than Rep. Al Green (Tex.) \u2014 the Democrat from Houston who held a hometown news conference two days before calling for the impeachment of President Trump. Then came allegations that Trump had pressured the FBI director to beg off a criminal investigation of his security adviser \u2014 and then came the media.",
        "The stock market on Wednesday took its biggest dive since before President Trump\u2019s election, as investors began to grapple with the increasing possibility that Washington would be consumed with chaos and fail to enact policies to boost the economy. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 368 points, or 1. 8 percent to 20, 611, as a broad array of other indexes all lost ground.",
        "News broke Tuesday evening that Director James B. Comey had written notes in February indicating that President Trump had asked him to end an investigation of former White House national security adviser Michael T. Flynn. It was big news to the rest of us. To Matthew Miller, it was as predicted. Five days before the New York Times broke that story, the former top Justice Department spokesman tweeted this: One thing I learned at DOJ about Comey: he leaves a protective paper trail whenever he deems something inappropriate happened. Stay tuned. https: .",
        "With the stroke of a pen, Rod Rosenstein redeemed his reputation, preserved the justice system, pulled American politics back from the brink \u2014 and, just possibly, saved the Republican Party and President Trump from themselves.",
        "There is really only one issue in American politics at this moment: Will we accelerate our way to the end of the Trump story, or will our government remain mired in scandal, misdirection and paralysis for many more months \u2014 or even years? There is a large irony in the politics behind this question. The Democrats\u2019 narrow interest lies in having President Trump hang around as close to the 2018 midterm elections as possible. Yet they are urging steps that could get this resolved sooner rather than later.",
        "The Post reports: The Justice Department has decided to appoint a special counsel to investigate possible coordination between Trump associates and Russian officials seeking to meddle in last year\u2019s election, according to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Robert Mueller, a former prosecutor who served as the FBI director from 2001 to 2013, has agreed to serve in the role, Rosenstein said. The move marks a concession by the Trump administration to Democratic demands for the investigation to be run independently of the Justice Department. Calls for a special counsel have increased since Trump fired FBI Director James B.",
        "Today\u2019s lesson in How Washington Really Works begins with the 11th Commandment: \u201cThou shalt retain documentation of all communications with the boss. \u201d If anyone understands that, it\u2019s James B. Comey, a highly credentialed lawyer who had a couple of decades\u2019 worth of federal experience under his belt before taking over the FBI in 2013. Whatever mistakes this bureaucrat par excellence committed amid the political turbulence of the past year and a half, failure to follow the 11th Commandment was not one of them \u2014 it never would have been.",
        "Although William J. Baumol, who recently died at 95, was not widely known beyond the ranks of economists, all Americans are living with, and policymakers are struggling with, \u201cBaumol\u2019s disease. \u201d It is one reason brisk economic growth is becoming more elusive as it becomes more urgent. And it is a disease particularly pertinent to the increasingly fraught debate.",
        "WASHINGTON AND the country received a shot of good news Wednesday evening with the revelation that the Justice Department will appoint a special counsel. Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein named Robert S. Mueller III, a former FBI chief. This was an essential and reassuring step after a series of alarming developments. The first question for Mr. Mueller will be whether the Russian government meddled in the 2016 presidential election. The second question will be whether anyone in the Trump campaign colluded in the meddling.",
        "Funding for college programs would be cut in half, loan forgiveness would end and hundreds of millions of dollars that public schools could use for mental health, advanced coursework and other services would vanish under a Trump administration plan to cut $10. 6 billion from federal education initiatives, according to budget documents obtained by The Washington Post. The administration would channel part of the savings into its top priority: school choice.",
        "Workers at McLane drive forklifts and load hefty boxes into trucks. The grocery supplier, which runs a warehouse in Colorado, needs people who will stay alert \u2014 but prospective hires keep failing drug screens. \u201cSome weeks this year, 90 percent of applicants would test positive for something,\u201d ruling them out for the job, said Laura Stephens, a human resources manager for the company in Denver. The state\u2019s unemployment rate is already low \u2014 3 percent, compared to 4. 7 percent for the entire nation.",
        "The story of Seth Rich\u2019s killing has made a sudden comeback thanks to Fox News, but the latest reporting seems to have generated more controversy than credibility. Rich\u2019s family is demanding a retraction from Fox for airing unsubstantiated claims about the Democratic National Committee staffer, whose death last year generated a wild river of theories and innuendo about who was behind it. Fox\u2019s latest reporting on the unsolved crime has an odd twist: Much of its work relies on a private investigator who is also a Fox News contributor.",
        "Ernest Hemingway is the macho face of prose. His birth in 1899 marked the arrival of a man who wanted to dissociate literature from the taint of femininity it had acquired under the influence of Oscar Wilde and align it instead with a kind of hairy masculinity. Lilies and wallpaper were finished. In their place? Blood, battle, sex, hunts, death. Manly things. And to treat manly things properly, literature would require an appropriately manly style. Out with girly adjectives, rapt similes, elaborate metaphors, ethereal ruminations. In with curt observation, plain sentences, icy repetition.",
        "D. C. police announced they are pursuing charges against additional suspects involved in Tuesday\u2019s violent clash between demonstrators and guards for visiting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Two people with direct knowledge of the investigation said authorities are reviewing video to try to identify Erdogan guards who they believe instigated the melee outside the Turkish ambassador\u2019s residence. Nine people were injured; two arrests already have been made.",
        "On Tuesday, President Trump warmly welcomed Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to the White House. Just hours later, we found out that Trump would like to put reporters in jail. There\u2019s a connection here. And it\u2019s not good news for America\u2019s journalists or the citizens who depend on them to hold their government accountable. Both as a candidate and as president, Trump has shown no regard for the role of a free press in a democracy.",
        "Robert Zubrin started the Mars Society nearly two decades ago with the dream of creating a human settlement on the Red Planet. \u201cThe time has come for humanity to journey to Mars!\u201d he announced one night in the summer of 1998, at the group\u2019s founding convention in Boulder, Colo. He then read the society\u2019s Founding Declaration: \u201cWe must go, not for us, but for the people who are yet to be. We must do it for the Martians. \u201d This reporter was there and filed a story for The Washington Post\u2019s Style section.",
        "Devon Wallick had written nine drafts of his commencement speech. He had recited it for his professor, delivered it to his roommate and practiced it in front a mirror \u201cabout 1, 500 times. \u201d But Wallick, a about to finish a master\u2019s degree in accounting, had not yet rehearsed in front of Dexter. So on a recent Monday, he appeared at American University\u2019s business school for a 3:30 p. m. appointment with the pooch, an English springer spaniel with giant white paws, soulful brown eyes and floppy ears that are soft to the touch and, apparently, good devices.",
        "President Trump on Thursday denied ever asking FBI Director James B. Comey to back off his agency\u2019s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, as well as into the role played by former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Asked whether he urged Comey to ease up on the Flynn investigation, Trump said at a news conference, \u201cNo, no,\u201d before ordering the media to move on to the \u201cnext question. \u201d Earlier this week there were several news reports that Trump made the request regarding Flynn during a February meeting in the Oval Office.",
        "President Trump\u2019s silence lasted just over 12 hours. Then, he let it all out. The appointment of a special counsel to investigate possible collusion between his campaign and Russia was the \u201csingle greatest witch hunt in American history,\u201d he tweeted. Hours later, during a news conference with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, Trump revisited the topic. \u201cI think it\u2019s totally ridiculous. Everybody thinks so,\u201d Trump said when asked about the appointment. \u201cEverybody, even my enemies, have said there is no collusion.",
        "Newly appointed special counsel Robert S. Mueller III will undergo a Justice Department ethics review that will examine possible conflicts of interest regarding his former law firm, which represents several figures who could be caught up in the probe into Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election. Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said Thursday that the agency will conduct a background investigation and detailed review of issues, a process outlined in the regulation governing special counsels under which he was appointed.",
        "President Trump said Thursday that Joe Lieberman was his top choice to become FBI director, filling the slot left open after Trump fired James B. Comey, his previous FBI head, last week. Trump, speaking to a group of television anchors at the White House Thursday, said that Lieberman, the former senator from Connecticut and Democratic vice presidential nominee, is his leading candidate to run the agency. The president also told the group that he was close to a decision, an assertion he repeated later at a joint appearance with President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia.",
        "At the center of so many political \u2014 and now possibly legal \u2014 controversies of the Trump administration is one man: retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn. Flynn, Trump\u2019s national security adviser during the transition and for less than a month during his presidency, was involved in a lot of questionable Trump administration actions, including: Repeatedly talking with the Russians despite warnings from others on Team Trump not to (and despite the White House denying in January that it had contacts with Russian officials during the campaign).",
        "FBI Director James B. Comey prepared extensively for his discussions with President Trump, out of concern that the president was unlikely to respect the legal and ethical boundaries governing their respective roles, according to associates of the FBI chief. The associates recounted how worried Comey was about meeting with Trump and recalled conversations in which they brainstormed how to handle moments in which the president asked for details of an investigation.",
        "Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein told the full Senate he knew that former Director James B. Comey would be fired before he wrote his controversial memo that the White House initially used as justification for President Trump firing the FBI director. Sen. Richard Durbin ( .) said that Rosenstein told the senators that he knew on Monday, the day before Comey was fired, that Trump was going to fire him. He also told them that he was not pressured into writing his memo.",
        "As Donald Trump has grown increasingly angry and frustrated with his White House staff, the beleaguered targets of his ire have a quietly roiling gripe of their own \u2014 their boss, the president himself. Since he fired FBI Director James B. Comey, Trump has lurched through crises of his own making \u2014 from the explosive report Monday that he had revealed highly classified intelligence to Russian officials to the bombshell Tuesday that he had urged Comey to end the federal investigation into Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser.",
        "The pleasant surprise of the First 100 Days is over. The action was hectic, heated, often confused, but well within the bounds of normalcy. Policy (e. g. health care) was being hashed out, a Supreme Court nominee confirmed, foreign policy challenges (e. g. North Korea) addressed. Donald Trump\u2019s character \u2014 volatile, impulsive, often \u2014 had not changed since the campaign. But it seemed as if the guardrails of our democracy \u2014 Congress, the courts, the states, the media, the Cabinet \u2014 were keeping things within bounds. Then came the past 10 days."
