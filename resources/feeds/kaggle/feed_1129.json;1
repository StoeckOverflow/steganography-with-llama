        "President Trump believes he is being persecuted, and that is a frighteningly dangerous for a man with such vast power. Amid a week of dizzying developments on multiple fronts, Trump gave a graduation speech Wednesday at the U. S. Coast Guard Academy portraying himself as a victim, unfairly besieged by those who would destroy him. \u201cNo politician in history, and I say this with great surety, has been treated worse or more unfairly,\u201d Trump said.",
        "Some are born catastrophic, some achieve catastrophe, and some have catastrophe thrust upon them. So far President Trump falls only in the first two of those three buckets. For that, my fellow Americans, we should all be very, very grateful. Gratitude may not feel terribly warranted right now. Over the past four long months, we have endured scandal after scandal, crisis after crisis, from this White House.",

Gerhardt, a professor of constitutional law at University of North Carolina Law School, is the author of \u201cThe Federal Impeachment Process: A Constitutional and Historical Analysis. \u201d President Trump\u2019s promise to shake things up in Washington has brought us back to unpleasantly familiar territory: talk of impeachment and obstruction of justice, this time involving the investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s dealings with Russia.",
        "As the Trump presidency enters its fourth month, conservatives are eager for more legislative successes, more nominations and confirmations of judges, the rapid confirmation of a new FBI director and other achievements. Given the charges of collusion and obstruction that have dogged Donald Trump and his administration from before he took his oath of office as president, the appointment of former FBI director Robert S. Mueller III as a special prosecutor to oversee the Justice Department\u2019s inquiry into those charges is a greatly encouraging development. In Mueller, Deputy Attorney General Rod J.",

        "This post has been updated with a comment from the vice president\u2019s office. There are more than a few people who look at Vice President Pence and see President Pence \u2014 possibly sooner than later. For wistful Democrats, it would be the end result of President Trump stepping aside or being impeached; for wistful Republicans, some dream of a more serious, less Republican president actually succeeding at passing a conservative agenda. But as The Post\u2019s Abby Phillip began documenting last week, Pence has hardly been immune from Trump\u2019s foibles and from saying untrue things about them.",

        "Attorneys general from 15 states and the District of Columbia filed a motion Thursday to intervene in a lawsuit over a core part of the Affordable Care Act. In their legal filing, the attorneys general say they can\u2019t trust the Trump administration to defend their interests, because health insurance for millions of Americans has become \u201clittle more than political bargaining chips\u201d for the White House. The lawsuit is challenging how billions of dollars of federal payments were made to health insurers.",

He hoped a proposal to release old and sick violent offenders in Louisiana would allow him to live with his niece in Shreveport, La. \u201cI\u2019m no longer a danger,\u201d Giddens said last month at Angola, his voice barely above a whisper.",
        "In the hours immediately after the sudden passing of Fox News Roger Ailes on Thursday, journalists scrambled to cover his unexpected death and many who knew him offered testimony to his tenacity and vision. Yet among some of the many figures whose careers Ailes made and molded, there was only stony silence. Former Fox anchor Megyn Kelly, who became a star under Ailes\u2019 tutelage, had nothing to say.

Speculation that Temer would step down intensified throughout the day, with Brazil\u2019s highest court ordering an investigation and two members of Temer\u2019s cabinet abruptly quitting.

But an international team of researchers is making a radical argument for why that may not be the case: Had the asteroid that likely wiped out the dinosaurs slammed into the planet a few minutes earlier or later, the scientists say, the fabled reptiles could still be walking the earth now.",
        "At lunchtime Wednesday, as he basked in the late spring sun in his wheelchair, Zaan Scott said he was feeling more optimistic. And that was remarkable, considering all he\u2019d been through over the previous five weeks. At the beginning of April, he was a with a fianc\u00e9e he adored and a job he loved as a Capitol Hill swim instructor. Coach Z was a pool god who got frightened children out of the shallow end and taught them how to execute a perfect freestyle stroke. He was a coach, mentor and confidant.",
        "When you hear a siren wail, it s a warning. Something big is brewing. Chris Cornell was lucky enough to be born with a siren in his throat, and when it first pricked the nation s eardrums in 1991, he was warning us that a new generation of hairy rock groups was about to reconquer the planet. And his band, Soundgarden, would be screaming in the center of it. His voice signaled great urgency and tremendous physicality \u201d which makes the singer s suicide, mere hours after a Soundgarden concert in Detroit on Wednesday, such a surprise.",

Follow the light!\u201d It sounded like a scene from the 1980s film \u201cPoltergeist,\u201d but it was, in fact, photojournalist Ron Haviv giving some high school students sound photographic advice.

Let that sink in. [Russia probe reaches current White House official, people familiar with the case say] Among many things, the focus on someone close to the president means that the firewall protecting him from the full heat of media scrutiny is crumbling.",
        "This article has been updated. Two weeks ago Thursday, President Trump delayed his trip back home to New York \u2014 or, really, back to his golf club in Bedminster, N. J. \u2014 because he wanted to have a few dozen friends over from Capitol Hill for a celebration in the Rose Garden. House Republicans, after an embarrassing failure in March, had cobbled together enough votes to pass the American Health Care Act, the GOP\u2019s planned overhaul of Obamacare.

        "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 President Trump, whose dark, guttural demonization of Muslims was a trademark of his nationalist campaign, arrives here Saturday hoping the Arab world will listen to a new message.

        "President Trump\u2019s visit to Saudi Arabia \u2014 the first stop on his first overseas trip, beginning Friday \u2014 is designed to solidify what the administration envisions as its premier partnership in the Arab and Muslim world, effectively anointing the kingdom as Islam\u2019s political as well as religious leader.

The monument will be the last of this city\u2019s four contested Confederate monuments to come down after months of heated debate. \u201cThey are not just innocent remembrances of a benign history.

In doing so, he promised that prosecutors would be \u201c and not micromanaged from Washington. \u201d That justification is laughable.
