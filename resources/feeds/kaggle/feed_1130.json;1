        "For most of his life, Donald Trump has found words to be his friends. He has used them to build his business, dramatize his achievements and embellish his accomplishments. As important, he has used them to explain away his missteps and to paper over his problems. He built a building in glass and steel, but through his wordplay, it became 68 stories tall. He owns an apartment in Manhattan, but in his telling, it\u2019s 33, 000 square feet. Trump has used words extravagantly and cleverly to serve his ambition.",
        "Former New York congressman Anthony Weiner, the disgraced politician whose \u2018sexting\u2019 scandals shattered his career, admitted Friday in federal court to sending sexual material to a girl. Weiner, 52, pleaded guilty to transferring obscene material to a minor \u2014 a crime that will require him to register as a sex offender and could mean years in prison. \u201cI have a sickness, but I do not have an excuse,\u201d he told the court. \u201cI apologize to everyone I have hurt. I apologize to the teenage girl, whom I mistreated so badly.",
        "The president of the Czech Republic is eager to have Ivanka Trump visit his country, and he believes he has a compelling case to make. By a happy coincidence, ? her mother is Czech, and President Milos Zeman hopes that s the opening he needs to secure a visit from the first daughter as he tries to realize the kind of relationship with the U. S. government that his country has long craved.",
        "LONDON \u201d Swedish prosecutors on Friday dropped their investigation into a rape allegation against Julian Assange, closing a nearly legal saga that led the WikiLeaks founder to seek sanctuary at the Ecuadoran Embassy in London. But British police said that Assange still faces arrest for jumping bail if he walks out of diplomatic protection, which he claims is needed to keep him from being extradited to the United States to face charges of disclosing confidential military and diplomatic documents.",
        "Former vice president Joe Biden stirred the Democratic pot a little bit on Thursday night. Appearing at the SALT hedge fund conference in Las Vegas, the possible 2020 presidential candidate weighed in on Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 candidacy in a way that Clinton supporters sure won\u2019t like. \u201cI never thought she was a great candidate,\u201d Biden said, according to reports. \u201cI thought I was a great candidate. \u201d Biden clarified, according to CNN, that \u201cHillary would have been a really good president. \u201d But that isn\u2019t likely to make Clinton supporters feel much better.",
        "This article has been updated. After he met with President Trump this week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan traveled to Embassy Row in Northwest Washington, where Turkey\u2019s ambassador has a home. At some point while Erdogan was there, a group of people across the street at Sheridan Circle began to loudly protest. The red marker indicates the ambassador\u2019s home. The green marker is the location of the protesters. That protest ended violently, with and sides exchanging blows. Voice of America caught the beginning of the fight.",
        "In January 2015, President Barack Obama visited Saudi Arabia. It was a trip: Obama was there to attend the funeral of the late Saudi King Abdullah at a time when the relationship was strained for a number of factors, including the U. S. attempt to secure a nuclear deal with Iran. Much of the immediate attention, however, wasn\u2019t on the president, but on first lady Michelle Obama and her choice of attire.",
        "On Friday, Iran will elect its next president. More than 1, 600 people registered as candidates, but only six were approved by the Guardian Council, the appointed religious authorities. The are Ebrahim Raisi, Iran\u2019s former attorney general who now runs the country\u2019s holiest site, and Hassan Rouhani, the popular moderate incumbent. Just like in the United States, these quadrennial contests often pit conservatives against progressives, or their theological equivalents. But no matter who wins, one thing is almost certainly true: The president will have a grueling experience working with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
        "Wakhan, Afghanistan. July 2008. (Stanley ) An American poet and photojournalist, Stanley Greene died Thursday night after a long illness in Paris, surrounded by friends and fellow photographers. He was 68. Greene followed the light even into the darkest places. He was best known as a conflict photographer for his work in Chechnya, Russia, Iraq and Syria. He had the gift of finding beauty in the most extraordinarily disturbing circumstances. His books, \u201cOpen Wound\u201d and \u201cBlack Passport,\u201d are gorgeous journeys through his life by way of his haunting photographs.",
        "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 President Trump made a splashy debut on the world stage here Saturday, ushering in a new era in U. S. Arabian relations by signing a joint \u201cstrategic vision\u201d that includes $110 billion in American arms sales and other new investments that the administration said would bring hundreds of thousands of jobs. \u201cIt was a great day,\u201d Trump said. He cited \u201ctremendous investments in the United States . . . and jobs, jobs, jobs. \u201d While initial details were scant, the agreements signed included a U. S.",
        "Saudi Arabia, the kingdom touted by President Trump as a key ally in the fight against the Islamic State, has helped block a Trump administration proposal to impose sanctions against a Saudi branch of the terrorist group, documents show. The plan to add the Islamic State\u2019s Saudi affiliate to a U. N. list of terrorist groups was quietly killed two weeks ago in a bureaucratic maneuver at the U. N. Security Council, records show. U. S.",
        "After two weeks of what one The Washington Post writer calls \u201cnearly unrelenting disaster of bad decisions and bad news,\u201d Trump embarked on his first overseas trip as president to visit Saudi Arabia on Saturday. Some supporters and conservative websites exulted as soon as he stepped off the plane \u2014 quick to contrast it with a similar meeting at the start of Obama\u2019s presidency. GREAT AGAIN: Unlike Obama, Trump doesn\u2019t bow. .. https: . \u2014 DRUDGE REPORT (@DRUDGE_REPORT) May 20, 2017 Trump greeted by Saudi in most elaborate welcome in their history.",
        "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 The last time a U. S. first lady visited this Middle Eastern kingdom, she was criticized for appearing in public without a headscarf. Michelle Obama was blasted on Saudi social media \u2014 as well as by a prominent American tweeter named Donald Trump \u2014 for not covering her head during her 2015 visit, as women are expected to do in this conservative Islamic country. So there was some anticipation about whether first lady Melania Trump and first daughter Ivanka Trump would cover their heads during their visit this weekend to Riyadh.",
        "Hair freshly done from the beauty parlor on a recent Friday morning, Ada Clark, 93, and her daughter Carol, 63, met in front of the J. C. Penney in the Pueblo Mall, about 100 miles south of Denver. Their afternoon plan: a walk around the mall, followed by lunch at Red Lobster. When the mall was built in 1976, Pueblo was a booming steel town. The Colorado Fuel and Iron Co. was the city\u2019s largest employer, and a meatpacking plant also offered good wages. The mall \u2014 with its 1, 100 retail jobs \u2014 has outlasted them both.",
        "The Pentagon has generated almost $6 billion over the past seven years by charging the armed forces excessive prices for fuel and has used the money \u2014 called the \u201cbishop\u2019s fund\u201d by some critics \u2014 to bolster mismanaged or underfunded military programs, documents show. Since 2015, the Defense Department has tapped surpluses from its fuel accounts for $80 million to train Syrian rebels, $450 million to shore up a program riddled with fraud and $1. 4 billion to cover unanticipated expenses from the war in Afghanistan, according to military accounting records.",
        "As the Bill Cosby sex scandal spread, flaring into a media firestorm, the woman best positioned to confront him in a criminal court kept returning to her tattoo artist. Thickly rendered lines twist and curl up Andrea Constand\u2019s forearm, then past her elbow. On her upper left arm she had a brilliant pink gladiolus etched into her skin. Constand had seen Lili Bernard, another woman who has accused the comedian of drugging and sexually assaulting her, carrying the spiky flower at a Cosby protest. Bernard said her friend was inspired. In Latin, the flower\u2019s name means a small sword.",
        "Why does President Trump behave in the dangerous and seemingly ways he does? Three decades ago, I spent nearly a year hanging around Trump to write his first book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d and got to know him very well. I spent hundreds of hours listening to him, watching him in action and interviewing him about his life. To me, none of what he has said or done over the past four months as president comes as a surprise. The way he has behaved over the past two weeks \u2014 firing FBI Director James B.",
        "President Trump can legally share classified material with any foreign leaders he likes, as it appears he did recently in an Oval Office meeting with Russia\u2019s foreign minister and its ambassador to the United States. But the information Trump reportedly shared with the Russians was originally passed to U. S. officials by another country\u2019s intelligence service (Israel\u2019s, according to media reports) which didn\u2019t agree in advance to letting him disclose it. As a former CIA officer, I fear that sharing information without coordinating with our allies will almost certainly hurt the country\u2019s security in the long run.",
        "Appointing special counsel Robert Mueller to probe Russian meddling in the 2016 election (and any possible ties to President Trump\u2019s campaign) was the only choice the Justice Department had. This is the best way to deal with the conflicts and potential conflicts of interest these matters posed. In fact, the regulations under which Mueller was appointed were written precisely to address a situation like this one. I would know; I wrote them, in 1999. But it\u2019s also a highly imperfect solution, because it doesn\u2019t foreclose the possibility of political interference in the investigation.",
        "TEL AVIV \u2014 What makes the United States a good ally to Israel? What makes a president of the United States a good partner? I pondered these questions frequently during nearly six years as President Barack Obama\u2019s ambassador to Israel, and they have renewed relevance as President Trump prepares to undertake his first visit here. The answers \u2014 which have less to do with policy, and more to do with personal qualities and management \u2014 may be less obvious than they appear.",
        "A few years ago, a fellow dean pulled me aside to have an uncomfortable conversation. I had been telling colleagues about advice I received as a new professor. A mentor told me: Everyone who joins the faculty at Harvard Business School is smart. So the key to succeeding is to get to work early enough to have your choice of parking spots and to leave late enough that it\u2019s easy to spot your car from a distance. In other words, our parking lot offered a simple visual indicator of how hard I was working.",
        "PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD two responses to last week\u2019s appointment of a special counsel to take over the Russia investigation \u2014 one unbecoming, the other somewhat reasonable. \u201cThe entire thing has been a witch hunt,\u201d Mr. Trump declared at a Thursday news conference, denying that there was any collusion between his campaign and Russian operatives seeking to disrupt the 2016 election. \u201cI think it divides the country. \u201d That is rich coming from a man who has exacerbated national divisions for political gain, and whose abrupt and unnecessary dismissal of FBI Director James B.",
        "Democrats are heading into the homestretch of three special elections over the next month amid a national frenzy over the investigation into the possible connections of President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and Russian interference in the election. Yet in all three races, Democrats have made a tactical decision not to turn the contests into a referendum on Trump\u2019s alleged scandals and instead are focusing on policy decisions by the president and congressional Republicans. Democratic strategists privately say that this might be the recurring theme through the November 2018 midterm elections.",
        "On Friday, a slew of alarming headlines emerged regarding the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. Water had apparently breached this \u201c \u201d trove of the planet\u2019s seeds that is supposed to protect earth\u2019s food supply in the event of a \u201cdoomsday\u201d scenario. The alleged failure of the vault, buried deep into an Arctic mountainside, had occurred after warmer than usual temperatures had caused a layer of permafrost to melt, \u201csending meltwater gushing into the entrance tunnel\u201d and presumably putting the world\u2019s most diverse collection of crop seeds at risk, according to the Guardian.",
        "BENTON, Ky. \u2014 The congressman was home in Kentucky now, traveling through his district for the first time in a month and worried that, for Republicans, the \u201cwheels were falling off. \u201d Washington had been feeling like a city on fire. Every day brought a new crisis. Russia. The FBI. The vote to replace the Affordable Care Act, which he had cast just before leaving. \u201cSo much doom and gloom,\u201d Rep. James Comer ( .) said. \u201cIt can play games with your mind.",
        "A man was handcuffed and led off a plane in Honolulu on Friday after passengers helped him to his seat and fighter jets escorted the flight to the airport. Before he even boarded the plane, Anil Uskanli had been arrested by police at Los Angeles International Airport after a worker allegedly spotted him walking through a security door leading from the terminal to an airfield ramp shortly before 3 a. m Friday. He was released after being charged with a misdemeanor, police said. The had been drinking, airport police explained in a statement, but wasn\u2019t drunk.",
        "An already tumultuous week of news for the White House was capped off by a New York Times report on Friday that said President Trump discussed his abrupt firing of James B. Comey as FBI director during an Oval Office meeting with Russian officials the day after the termination. \u201cI just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job,\u201d Trump said, according to an account reported by the Times that was not disputed by the White House. \u201cI faced great pressure because of Russia. That\u2019s taken off.",
        "President Trump vowed on the campaign trail to boost economic growth and be the \u201cgreatest jobs producer that God ever created. \u201d His economic legacy is far from sealed, but it\u2019s safe to say he has made at least one industry flush: the Washington region\u2019s portable toilet industry. The Trump presidency has brought an increased number of protests \u2014 and, yes, bladders and bowels \u2014 to the Mall. Protest organizers are renting record numbers of in the Trump era for demonstrators to relieve themselves between chants and marches.",
        "Interviews by Michele Langevine leiby Law student Adam Firestone, 23, and theater professional Dani Markowitz, 22, have backgrounds so similar, they almost seem like the version of each other. The two natives met for beer and pizza at Pizzeria Paradiso in Dupont Circle. Then a food allergy popped up. . .. Adam: I arrived first, and then I saw someone who looked like maybe she was a little nervous. I could just tell it was probably her. Dani: I was just very nervous about the whole thing. Then I was relieved.",
        "If you travel, you will leave a charcoal smudge in your wake. You can\u2019t help it. Planes spew carbon emissions, hotels guzzle gallons of water to launder sheets and towels, and thirsty travelers plastic bottles of water. But don\u2019t let the guilt dampen your vacation. travel practices can lift the remorse and lighten the blemish on Mother Earth. Green travel is not a passing trend but a portable lifestyle choice.
