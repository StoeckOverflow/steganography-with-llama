While un or tho dox, the Ethio pian lasagna does have a foundation in East African cooking.",
        "President Trump\u2019s first major budget proposal on Tuesday will include massive cuts to Medicaid and call for changes to programs that would give states new power to limit a range of benefits, people familiar with the planning said, despite growing unease in Congress about cutting the safety net. For Medicaid, the program that provides health care to Americans, Trump\u2019s budget plan would follow through on a bill passed by House Republicans to cut more than $800 billion over 10 years.",
        "White House national security adviser H. R. McMaster on Sunday did not deny that President Trump discussed his motivation for firing FBI Director James B. Comey in an Oval Office meeting with Russian officials this month. McMaster would not directly address details of the meeting, but he did not deny reports that Trump revealed classified intelligence information in that meeting and told the Russian officials that Comey\u2019s firing eased \u201cgreat pressure\u201d on the White House. McMaster said only that Trump was speaking about his desire to find common ground with the Russians.",
        "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 President Trump forcefully summoned the Muslim world to confront \u201cthe crisis of Islamic extremism\u201d here Sunday on the eve of visits to Israel and the Vatican as he seeks to unite followers of disparate faiths against global terrorism. Speaking from the birthplace of Islam, Trump implored the leaders of dozens of Muslim nations to take their destinies in hand and, together with the United States, eliminate the \u201cwave of fanatical violence\u201d committed in the name of religion.",
        "ISTANBUL \u2014 He talked about Islam. He thundered against extremism. But after President Trump\u2019s hotly anticipated speech in Saudi Arabia was over Sunday, many in the Arab world latched on to another theme from his address, one that explained why a leader who had shown hostility toward Muslims would travel to the religion\u2019s birthplace. The answer? The bottom line. \u201cThis summit has nothing to do with security.",
        "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 Ivanka Trump brought her message of female empowerment Sunday to the world\u2019s most repressive society for women, a place where women are not allowed to drive, must cover themselves from head to toe in public and require permission from a \u201cmale guardian\u201d to travel outside their homes. \u201cIn every country, including the United States, women and girls face challenges,\u201d Trump told a small group of accomplished Saudi women gathered for a dialogue with her about how to build on their successes.",
        "If anyone ever needed a conversion experience \u2014 and fast \u2014 it is President Trump. The issue here is not switching religions. What he could use is an honest examination of his conscience, his attitude toward himself and others, and his approach to what it means to be a leader. Even to suggest such a possibility seems absurd, more an inspiration for a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sketch than a serious prospect. Moving an incorrigible narcissist toward is as likely as changing the course of a river or the trajectory of the Earth\u2019s rotation around the sun.",
        "To everyone dreaming of a quick and easy impeachment: What do you imagine happens the day after? Passions subside. President Pence begins his orderly reign. Donald Trump retreats to . Normalcy returns. That\u2019s about what you have in mind, right? Dream on. Here\u2019s a likelier scenario: Trump goes to to regroup, not retreat. Early in the morning, he tweets: \u201cJoin me on Day One of our campaign to reverse the most corrupt theft in political history and reclaim the White House in 2020. \u201d His supporters vow to reverse the coup d\u2019etat. And the wars intensify.",
        "Despite President Trump\u2019s reluctance to get deeply involved in the Syrian civil war, the United States now finds itself in the middle of an escalating battle in the country\u2019s south that last week led to a clash between the U. S. military and forces. If he can seize the opportunity, Trump could deal a blow to Iranian regional influence and help save Syria in the process. To hear the Trump administration tell it, the coalition airstrike May 18 near the base on Syria\u2019s border with Jordan and Iraq was a event. A statement from U. S.",
        "The United States may have escaped most digital damage from this month\u2019s unleashing of a global \u201cransomware\u201d virus, though fear more attacks. One possible explanation is that the malicious software (\u201cmalware\u201d) harms older versions of Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system, which most Americans have replaced. Perhaps many users in other countries haven\u2019t. Whatever the explanation, this is not the end of Internet threats. The unmistakable lesson of recent years is that the Internet is a sword.",
        "IN THE space of just a few weeks, New Orleans has taken a major step toward a past that deserves very little glory. Acting on the vote of its city council, and with cover from state and federal courts that rebuffed specious challenges, the city took down monuments erected with the explicit goal of lionizing the Confederacy and a past in which slavery was a central and defining feature. Despite huffing and puffing by relatively small bands of whites \u2014 some armed, some unrepentantly racist \u2014 claiming their \u201cheritage\u201d was being dishonored, Mayor Mitch Landrieu acted decisively.",
        "Before he moves on to Israel and then to Europe, before we are consumed by the next scandal and forget, here is a list, for the record, of just a few of the ways in which President Trump\u2019s trip to Saudi Arabia was bizarre, unseemly, unethical and . It was a very strange choice for a first trip abroad. The past four American presidents, two Republicans and two Democrats, made their first trips to either Mexico and Canada, countries that are close trading partners, close allies, compatible democracies and of course neighbors.",
        "Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, a stalwart supporter of President Trump, used a appearance on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d to spread the conspiracy theory that former Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was killed last year to cover up the true story of how WikiLeaks obtained tens of thousands of hacked Democratic Party emails. \u201cWe have this very strange story now of this young man who worked for the Democratic National Committee, who apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning, having given WikiLeaks something like 53, 000 emails and 17, 000 attachments,\u201d Gingrich said.",
        "BUTTE, Mont. \u2014 For months, Democrats were careful not to promise too much about Montana\u2019s May 25 special election. Hillary Clinton had lost the state by 20. 2 points. Rob Quist, the Democratic candidate for Congress, had never run for office before. Losing a close race would grant a moral victory; raising the stakes and losing might give Republicans a boost. On Saturday, in front of 3, 000 cheering voters at this Democratic city\u2019s Civic Center, Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) raised the stakes.",
        "An Alexandria gym terminated the membership of white nationalist Richard Spencer last week after he was confronted by a Georgetown University professor who recognized him and lambasted him over his views. C. Christine Fair, an associate professor at Georgetown University\u2019s School of Foreign Service, said she was working out at Old Town Sport&Health on Wednesday when she spotted Spencer, president of the National Policy Institute. Fellow gym patrons had told Fair how Spencer had been seen at the gym earlier that week, she said.",
        "U. S. Rep. Al Green said the phone calls came in not long after he called for the impeachment of President Trump. \u201cHey, Al Green, we got an impeachment for you. It\u2019s going to be yours,\u201d one caller said. \u201cWas actually gonna give you a short prop trial before we hang your n \u2014 \u2014 ass. \u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not going to impeach anybody, you f \u2014 \u2014 n \u2014 \u2014 \u2026 You\u2019ll be hanging from a tree,\u201d another one said.",
        "When French voters resoundingly elected a centrist president rather than a antiglobalist this month, one reason may have been the nation s news media. As a French newspaper editor commented: We don t have a Fox News in France. ? The United States certainly does have one. Pretty soon, it may have the equivalent of two. Sinclair Broadcast Group has struck a deal with Tribune Media to buy dozens of local TV stations. And what Fox News is for cable, Sinclair could become for broadcast: programming with a soupcon \u201d or more \u201d of conservative spin.",
        "KATHMANDU, Nepal \u2014 Three Mount Everest climbers died and a fourth was missing as high winds eased and opened fleeting windows of good weather for teams to push toward the top of the world\u2019s tallest peak, authorities said Sunday. Roland Yearwood, a doctor from Alabama who returned to Everest after surviving the avalanche in 2015, died not far from the summit on the Nepal side early Sunday, according to Nepal tourism officials and his trekking company. Slovak mountaineer Vladimir Strba also died Sunday, and search operations continued for an Indian climber who was separated from his guide on Saturday.",
        "Some graduating seniors at the University of Notre Dame walked out of their own graduation ceremony to protest Vice President Pence when he began to deliver the commencement speech on Sunday morning. Pence was chosen to give the commencement address at the nation\u2019s most prominent Catholic university \u2014 even though the school ordinarily invites newly inaugurated presidents to give the address in their first year of office. Thousands of students and faculty members signed a petition asking Notre Dame\u2019s president, the Rev.",
        "The first part of a video shows a sea lion swimming near a dock in Steveston, a seaside community on Canada\u2019s western coast. The sound of cameras clicking can be heard in the background as onlookers marveled at its size. The animal swims closer to the dock after grabbing a piece of food that someone threw. It then rises from the water toward a little girl kneeling near the dock, then goes back in. The girl and others laugh. She sits on the dock.",
        "President Trump asked two of the nation\u2019s top intelligence officials in March to help him push back against an FBI investigation into possible coordination between his campaign and the Russian government, according to current and former officials. Trump made separate appeals to the director of national intelligence, Daniel Coats, and to Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, urging them to publicly deny the existence of any evidence of collusion during the 2016 election.",
        "President Trump is moving rapidly toward assembling outside counsel to help him navigate the investigations into his campaign and Russian interference in last year\u2019s election, and in recent days he and his advisers have privately courted several prominent attorneys to join the effort. By Monday, a list of finalists for the legal team had emerged, according to four people briefed on the discussions.",
        "Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser under President Trump, will not comply with a Senate Intelligence Committee subpoena for documents related to its probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 election, invoking the Fifth Amendment and his right against . Flynn\u2019s decision, which his attorneys announced in a letter sent Monday to committee chairman Richard Burr ( . C.) and vice chairman Mark R. Warner ( .) comes as evidence continues to mount elsewhere in Congress that the former national security adviser appears to have misrepresented his Russia ties. Rep.",
        "LONDON \u2014 An explosion at a pop concert in the northern English city of Manchester late Monday night left at least 19 people dead and around 50 others injured, according to police. \u201cThis is currently being treated as a terrorist incident until police know otherwise,\u201d the Greater Manchester Police said in a statement. Witnesses interviewed by the BBC reported hearing a loud blast following a performance by American pop singer Ariana Grande at Manchester Arena. Cell phone video showed chaotic scenes of people screaming and running in the aftermath of the blast.",
        "The Supreme Court ruled Monday that North Carolina\u2019s legislature relied on racial gerrymandering when drawing the state\u2019s congressional districts, a decision that could make it easier to challenge other state redistricting plans. The decision continued a trend at the court, where justices have found that racial considerations improperly tainted redistricting decisions by legislatures in Virginia, Alabama and North Carolina. Some cases involved congressional districts, others legislative districts.",
        "President Trump\u2019s 2018 budget request to Congress seeks massive cuts in spending on health programs, including medical research, disease prevention programs and health insurance for children of the working poor. The National Cancer Institute would be hit with a $1 billion cut compared to its 2017 budget. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute would see a $575 million cut, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases would see a reduction of $838 million. The administration would cut the overall National Institutes of Health budget from $31. 8 billion to $26 billion.",
        "President Trump\u2019s anticipated cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as food stamps, will likely be felt most in regions of the country with chronic high rates of unemployment \u2014 from the rural Southeast to aging manufacturing towns to Indian reservations. People in those regions are temporarily exempt from national work requirements for the SNAP program, because there are not enough jobs there for everyone who wants one. But there is growing anticipation that the budget to be unveiled on Tuesday could incorporate proposals drafted by the conservative Heritage Foundation that would eliminate or curtail the waivers.",
        "It is another development in the vast, unfolding scandal that is the Trump administration: President Trump\u2019s denigration of former FBI director James B. Comey to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in the Oval Office. In a New York Times article, Trump is quoted as saying, \u201cI just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job. \u201d Aside from the irony of the statement itself, it is appalling that an American president should be caught boasting about obstructing justice to the representative of a power that is so expert on the topic.",
        "John Podesta, the chair of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, served as counselor to President Barack Obama and chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. As President Trump makes his first foreign trip as commander in chief, his erratic behavior and mounting woes aren\u2019t the only cause of the United States\u2019 declining prestige in the eyes of foreign governments. On issue after issue involving international aid, development and governance, Trump\u2019s missteps \u2014 executed or planned \u2014 are contributing significantly to allies\u2019 skepticism and worries about U. S. policy.",
        "Back in 1951, Herman Wouk published the definitive book about the Trump administration. He set it in the 1940s, during the war in the Pacific, aboard a skippered by a paranoid man with a compulsion to blame others for his mistakes. The captain was named Philip Francis Queeg, his ship was called the USS Caine, and the novel was \u201cThe Caine Mutiny. \u201d It won the Pulitzer Prize. It\u2019s a dead certainty President Trump never read it."
