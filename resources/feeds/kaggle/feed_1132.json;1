        "Wondering what the country\u2019s system would look like under Trumpcare? Take a gander at Iowa, where the individual market is on the verge of collapse. Just one insurer remains in most of the state, and that insurer, Medica, is threatening to exit. Republicans love to point to Iowa\u2019s struggles as evidence of Obamacare\u2019s failures. But in reality, the Hawkeye State has functioned as a petri dish for the GOP\u2019s health plan. The state\u2019s problems provide useful lessons for what could go wrong if Trumpcare becomes law nationwide. So what, exactly, is the matter with Iowa?",
        "Richard L. Hasen is the chancellor\u2019s professor of law and political science at the University of California at Irvine and the author of \u201cPlutocrats United. \u201d Sometimes the most important stuff in Supreme Court opinions is hidden in the footnotes. In Monday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling striking down two North Carolina congressional districts as unconstitutionally influenced by race, the majority buried a doozy, a potentially powerful new tool to attack voting rights violations in the South and elsewhere. At issue in the case was whether two congressional districts drawn by the North Carolina General Assembly were unconstitutional \u201cracial gerrymanders.",
        "LET\u2019S DISPENSE with calling the frenzy of reports about Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich\u2019s death last summer fake news. So overused and misused is the phrase \u2014 by those seeking to disparage things they simply dislike or disagree with \u2014 that it risks losing real meaning. And there must be no ambiguity or confusion about the recent reports about Mr. Rich. They are lies. They do great harm. And those peddling them, including most recently former House speaker Newt Gingrich, are either ignorant of the facts or without scruple. Mr.",
        "ISTANBUL \u2014 Turkey\u2019s Foreign Ministry lodged a formal protest Monday with the U. S. ambassador over \u201caggressive\u201d actions by American security personnel during a visit to Washington last week by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that was marred by a violent clash between Turkish guards and protesters. The summoning of the ambassador, John Bass, sharply escalated a diplomatic rift between Turkey and the United States following the violence.",
        "JERUSALEM \u2014 President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sketched the broad outlines of a new architecture for the Middle East here late Monday, declaring common cause among the United States, Israel and Arab nations such as Saudi Arabia to roll back Iranian aggression and defeat Islamist terrorism. Their joint cooperation could \u201ccreate conditions for realistic peace\u201d in the region, a beaming Netanyahu said as he praised Trump for what he called a changed U. S. policy toward Iran.",
        "Wall Street bankers and investors are ratcheting back their expectations for Republicans to deliver wins that turbocharge the economy after a week of turmoil in the nation\u2019s capital that whipsawed markets. Those seeking an economic lift from Republican control of Washington in the form of a tax code rewrite and decreased financial regulations \u2014 along with a hefty dose of infrastructure spending \u2014 are becoming increasingly skeptical. The markets collapsed last week \u2014 while recovering much of that ground by Friday \u2014 as one bombshell report after another emerged about the Trump administration\u2019s relationship with Russia.",
        "Conservative talk show host Bill Mitchell has hatched an ingenious plot to destroy the credibility of major newspapers. You know what we should do? Start flooding the NYTimes and WAPO tip lines with all kinds of crazy \u201dleaks.\u201d Then laugh when they print them! \u2014 Bill Mitchell (@mitchellvii) May 21, 2017 Simple, right? Mitchell\u2019s theory is that the media is so hungry for unflattering information about President Trump that it will gobble up anything that feeds its narrative.",
        "In Washington, it is now as easy to get marijuana delivered to your front door as pizza. Really expensive pizza. More than two years after the District allowed residents to legally cultivate and possess cannabis for personal use, a growing gray market of companies has sprung up that will bring orders of cookies, juice, clothing or even artwork to your house, along with the \u201cgift\u201d of a few fat buds.",
        "PITTSBURGH \u2014 One third of the potential 100 jurors in the first round of jury selection for the Bill Cosby trial said Monday they\u2019ve already formed an opinion about the guilt or innocence of the legendary comedian. The large number of possible jurors whose opinions have already been shaped underscores the difficulty of selecting a panel to hear the case, which centers on allegations that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted a former Temple University women\u2019s basketball team staffer in 2004.",
        "LUMBERTON, N. C. \u2014 Sitting at a table at Jeff\u2019s Corner Cafe, Brenda Allen professed thanks for the good things before her. There were the creamy grits she ate and the jokes she shared with the other diners, most of whom she\u2019d known all her life. But she was most grateful that the small, blurry television set hanging in the corner of this breakfast spot was silent. \u201cYou know, I stopped watching Fox, and all the other channels, too,\u201d Allen, a retired nurse practitioner and Democrat, told her friend Julie. She sipped a little Mountain Dew.",
        "Like some bizarre parody of a Trump rally, a belligerent man in a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat was booted off a plane in Shanghai Sunday \u2014 defiantly waving as a crowd of passengers jeered in the terminal: \u201cLock him up! Lock him up!\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether Chinese police did jail the man or who he was. As others on the United Airlines flight described it, he started arguing before he stepped onto the plane. \u201cObviously, the hat provoked some of the stuff,\u201d said Alexis Zimmerman, who was flying back to Newark from a business trip.",
        "He was a millionaire, in Washington to toast President Trump\u2019s inauguration. She was a maid, tasked with cleaning rooms that cost more in a few days than her monthly rent. On Jan. 19, as the nation\u2019s capital swelled with tourists and protesters, the millionaire and the maid met on the 10th floor of the Mayflower Hotel downtown, in Room 1065. As she made his bed, he approached from behind and began rubbing her buttocks, according to a police report. \u201cThis is very nice stuff,\u201d he said, according to the report.",
        "Ford Motor Co. on Monday replaced its chief executive as the auto giant gears up to compete with Silicon Valley upstarts such as Tesla in the coming revolution in smart driving. Mark Fields retired after 28 years at the company. He was replaced by former Steelcase chief Jim Hackett, a longtime furniture executive who had almost zero experience in automobiles until he joined the company last year to head its \u201csmart mobility\u201d transportation initiative. \u201cWe need speed [in] decision making,\u201d Ford Chairman Bill Ford Jr. said in a Wall Street Journal interview.",
        "A Mississippi state lawmaker is under fire after calling for the lynching of leaders who supported the recent removal of Confederate monuments in Louisiana. In a Facebook post published Saturday night, Mississippi state Rep. Karl Oliver went on a diatribe about the controversial statues in his neighboring state, which have been taken down in recent weeks: The destruction of these monuments, erected in the loving memory of our family and fellow Southern Americans, is both heinous and horrific.",
        "MANCHESTER, England \u2014 British Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday night raised the nation\u2019s threat level and deployed the military to guard concerts, sports matches and other public events, saying another attack \u201cmay be imminent\u201d following a bombing Monday night that left 22 people dead. The announcement, which takes Britain\u2019s alert level from \u201csevere\u201d to its highest rating, \u201ccritical,\u201d clears the way for thousands of British troops to take to the streets and replace police officers in guarding key sites.",
        "When the bomb went off, Saffie Rose Roussos, 8, her mother and her older sister were heading out of Manchester Arena, among hundreds of concertgoers scrambling for Ariana Grande souvenirs before reaching the exits. The Roussos were separated by the flying shrapnel and stampede of people sprinting away and diving over barricades to escape the carnage, the Metro newspaper reported. Lisa Roussos and Saffie\u2019s sister, Ashlee Bromwich, both injured by shrapnel, were taken to separate hospitals. But as Monday night turned into Tuesday morning, no one could find Saffie.",

It was her first Ariana Grande concert, a surprise for her 11th birthday. She had traveled here Monday from Aberdeen, Scotland, with her parents.

        "MANCHESTER, England \u2014 I went to the Ariana Grande concert Monday expecting it to be one of the best nights of my life.

        "A week after publishing a problematic account about the death of former Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich \u2014 an article that said Rich made contact with WikiLeaks before he was shot and killed in Washington \u2014 Fox News retracted the story, saying it did not meet the organization\u2019s editorial standards. \u201cThe article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting,\u201d Fox said in a brief statement posted on its website Tuesday. \u201cUpon appropriate review, the article was found not to meet those standards and has since been removed.",
        "President Trump\u2019s proposal to cut federal spending by more than $3. 6 trillion over the next decade \u2014 including deep reductions for programs that help the poor \u2014 faced harsh criticism in Congress on Tuesday, where even many Republicans said the White House had gone too far. While some fiscally conservative lawmakers, particularly in the House, found a lot to praise in Trump\u2019s plan to balance the budget within 10 years, most Republicans flatly rejected the White House proposal.",
        "President Trump on Tuesday proposed dramatic changes to the role of the federal government, issuing a budget plan that culls or eliminates numerous programs that the White House says are a waste of money or create too much dependency. Some of these programs \u2014 including Medicaid and the modern version of food stamps \u2014 provide benefits to up to a fifth of all Americans, and the breadth of the cuts has rattled lawmakers from both parties who have warned that the reductions go too far.

        "White House officials are boasting that President Trump\u2019s budget would balance federal finances in 10 years. Yet despite extreme reductions in spending on health care for the poor, food stamps, education, science and other basic government programs, Trump\u2019s staff could only balance the budget by claiming vague savings and unspecified sources of new revenue \u2014 in other words, with trillions of dollars in mystery money. It is not just that Trump is counting on a rapid acceleration in economic growth that economists believe is unlikely, which the budget projects will yield $2.",
        "President Trump on Tuesday proposed a new process for closing numerous military bases, the elimination of government funding for public radio and television, and cuts of more than $1 billion to programs. He called to weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) defund several programs that study climate change, cut research on infectious diseases and reduce the Strategic Petroleum Reserve by 50 percent.

        "The writers are the parents of Seth Rich, who was killed in the District in 2016. Imagine living in a nightmare that you can never wake up from. Imagine having to face every single day knowing that your son was murdered. Imagine you have no answers \u2014 that no one has been brought to justice and there are few clues leading to the killer or killers.

By now you\u2019re exhausted by all the news \u2014 the terrorist slaughter in Manchester; the president\u2019s trip to Everywhere; and investigation upon investigation of the possible collusion with Russia, obstruction of justice and liars by the dozen. Which is why I\u2019m sitting in Palm Beach, Fla. practicing Lilly Pulitzer\u2019s dictum: \u201cBeing happy never goes out of style. \u201d Also, President Trump is not here, which seems to please everyone given that his frequent forays to his \u201csouthern White House\u201d have meant nothing but roadblocks, impenetrable traffic and lousy retail sales.",
        "President Trump arrived in Jerusalem this week with a most curious bit of information for Israeli President Reuven Rivlin. \u201cWe just got back from the Middle East,\u201d Trump announced. \u201cWe just got back from Saudi Arabia. \u201d At this, the Israeli ambassador to Washington, Ron Dermer, put his forehead in his palm. Did Trump not know Israel is in the Middle East? Did he not know he was in Israel? There was little time to contemplate this mystery, because Trump was moving on to generate more puzzlement at his meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister."
