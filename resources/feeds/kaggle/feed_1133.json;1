        "President Richard Nixon was heading for a big reelection victory in November that would confound his critics. He had just returned from a pathbreaking visit to China and had big, transformative ideas for foreign policy. Yet he felt hounded by his enemies and a media elite that opposed him at every turn. And there was that pesky FBI investigation into a \u201c burglary\u201d at the Watergate office building, about which the media were asking meddlesome questions.",
        "When a suicide bomber detonated explosives in the Manchester Arena in the United Kingdom, killing concertgoers as they filed out of pop star Ariana Grande\u2019s show, he joined a particularly insidious tradition of attacks on entertainment spaces. The killers who carry out such acts of terrorism aren\u2019t simply launching assaults on Western culture. They\u2019re attempting to destroy the particular freedom that comes from surrendering to art, exploiting the very vulnerability that accompanies that surrender. The apparent suicide bombing in Manchester was the fourth major such attack in five years.",
        "FORMER CIA DIRECTOR John Brennan told the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday that he grew worried last year about communications between the Russians and people in Donald Trump\u2019s orbit. \u201cI encountered and am aware of information and intelligence that revealed contacts and interactions between Russian officials and U. S. persons involved in the Trump campaign that I was concerned about because of known Russian efforts to suborn such individuals,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIt raised questions in my mind about whether Russia was able to gain the cooperation of those individuals. \u201d Mr.",
        "The Justice Department is pushing as a part of its budget proposal to change federal law so that local jurisdictions can be forced to detain suspected illegal immigrants upon request. The move would give the administration far more leeway to make good on its promise to crack down on \u201csanctuary cities\u201d \u2014 although it would surely meet resistance from some local law enforcement agencies that do not want their officers used to enforce immigration law.",
        "President Trump labeled North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un a \u201cmadman with nuclear weapons\u201d during a private phone conversation with Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte last month, just days before stating publicly that he would be \u201chonored\u201d to meet with Kim. In the April 29 call, Trump sought Duterte\u2019s input on whether Kim is \u201cstable or not stable\u201d and expressed some satisfaction in North Korea\u2019s recent failed missile tests, noting that \u201call his rockets are crashing.",
        "A of the Tuesday Group resigned his position leading the caucus of centrist House Republicans on Tuesday, citing raw feelings over his role in brokering a compromise that set up passage of the GOP overhaul this month. Rep. Tom MacArthur ( . J.) negotiated for weeks with the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus and other parties inside the House GOP, crafting an amendment that persuaded enough conservatives and moderates to support the teetering American Health Care Act.",
        "Shaurn Thomas, in an undated photo from prison, was ordered freed Tuesday after spending 24 years behind bars for a wrongful murder conviction. (Dechert LLP) Shaurn Thomas had claimed for 16 years that he didn\u2019t kill a popular Philadelphia businessman in a street robbery. He was 16 then, and said he had been at a juvenile court proceeding for trying to steal a motorcycle when the daylight slaying occurred. But the courts weren\u2019t buying it, and Thomas lost appeal after appeal. Convicted almost completely on the testimony of a he was sentenced to life without parole.",
        "The Justice Department filed a civil complaint Tuesday alleging that Fiat Chrysler Automobiles installed software designed to cheat emission controls in more than 100, 000 diesel vehicles, including its popular Jeep Grand Cherokee vehicle. The lawsuit states nearly 104, 000 vehicles are \u201cequipped with software functions that were not disclosed to regulators during the certification application process, and that the vehicles contain defeat devices,\u201d the Justice Department said in the complaint, which was filed Tuesday on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency. The complaint exposes Fiat to up to $4.",
        "A former who converted to Islam is accused of killing his two roommates because they \u201cdisrespected\u201d his new faith, police said. Last Friday evening, police arrested Devon Arthurs after he briefly held three people at gunpoint at a smoke shop in Tampa, then surrendered to officers. That incident, it turned out, was only the tip of the iceberg. During the arrest, Arthurs mentioned to police that people in an apartment across the street were \u201cdefinitely dead,\u201d according to Tampa Police Department records.",
        "JERUSALEM \u2014 President Trump told Israelis and Palestinians on Tuesday that he knows they are eager to reach a peace agreement with each other and that he is committed to helping them \u201cmake a deal.",
        "Animal locomotion. (Eadweard of Congress) If you are one of the many thousands people who tune in to horse racing\u2019s Triple Crown this time of year, watching a horse move is, in itself, no special feat. But before Eadweard Muybridge starting experimenting with photography in the 1870s, no one had ever seen it before. Muybridge, a photographic pioneer, was fascinated with movement and photography\u2019s ability to capture it. Long before Instagram added the hyperlapse and boomerang features, Muybridge invented the zoopraxiscope, which, much like the former, gave the effect of movement to still photography.",
        "legislation adopted by House Republicans earlier this month would leave 23 million more Americans uninsured by 2026 than under current law, the Congressional Budget Office projected Wednesday \u2014 only a million fewer than the estimate for the House\u2019s previous bill. The nonpartisan agency\u2019s finding, which drew immediate fire from Democrats, patient advocates, health industry officials and some business groups, is likely to complicate Republicans\u2019 push to pass a companion bill in the Senate.",
        "MANCHESTER, England \u2014 The investigation into a suicide blast that killed at least 22 people at a pop concert dramatically widened Wednesday, with security services on two continents rounding up suspects amid fears that the bombmaker who devised the source of the carnage remains at large. The arrests stretched from the normally quiet lanes of a northern English town to the bustling streets of Tripoli, where Libyan officials said they had disrupted a planned attack by the suspected bomber\u2019s brother.",
        "Chris Parker came to Manchester Arena as an anonymous beggar, positioning himself near the crowd of exiting Ariana Grande fans in hopes that he might pocket some spare change. He left the arena distraught after having witnessed the kind of carnage more typically seen in fields of combat. Sometime in between, the homeless man became a hero, a symbol of hope in a stunned nation craving exactly that. In turn, Parker and another homeless rescuer are being rewarded for their daring actions, though the devastation they encountered left them scarred.",
        "A secret document that officials say played a key role in Director James B. Comey\u2019s handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation has long been viewed within the FBI as unreliable and possibly a fake, according to people familiar with its contents. In the midst of the 2016 presidential primary season, the FBI received what was described as a Russian intelligence document claiming a tacit understanding between the Clinton campaign and the Justice Department over the inquiry into whether she intentionally revealed classified information through her use of a private email server.",
        "Caption   The founder of a creationist ministry wants to attract believers and nonbelievers to his   attractions.    The $120 million Ark Encounter is five stories high and took 700 workers seven years to build in Williamstown, Ky. Noah worked seven decades on his ark, according to the founders\u2019 interpretation, and was 600 years old when the flood arrived.  Luke   The Washington Post",
        "Newt Gingrich, a Republican from Georgia, was speaker of the House of Representatives from 1995 to 1999. He served as vice chair of the Trump transition team and is the author of the book \u201cUnderstanding Trump,\u201d which is scheduled to be released in June. This newspaper\u2019s legendary former publisher, Philip Graham, famously described journalism as the business of writing the \u201cfirst rough draft of history. \u201d This week, as President Trump gave a historic speech in Saudi Arabia before the leaders of more than 50 nations, journalism\u2019s first draft missed the history almost entirely.",
        "When the Congressional Budget Office first scored Republicans\u2019 Obamacare replacement in March, many Republican moderates were disturbed by the finding that 24 million fewer Americans would have health insurance under the GOP plan. The fallout was so bad that House Republican leaders eventually had to cancel the planned vote on the American Health Care Act. Two months after that embarrassing defeat, Republicans returned with a new AHCA, which they passed without waiting for a CBO score.",
        "ATLANTA By the time Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District votes in the June 20 special election, $40 million \u2014 perhaps more than $130 per ballot \u2014 will have been spent to pick of of one of the three branches of one of America\u2019s governments. This is an expensive funeral for Tip O\u2019Neill\u2019s incessantly quoted and increasingly inapplicable axiom that \u201cAll politics is local. \u201d If the slender shoulders of the Democratic candidate, Jon Ossoff, occasionally sag, this is not just from understandable fatigue \u2014 on a recent morning he had just deplaned from an fundraising sprint to New York.",
        "President Trump\u2019s budget demonstrates the costs of accepting lies as a normal currency in politics, broken promises as a customary way of doing business, false claims of being \u201cpopulist\u201d as the equivalent of the real thing and sloppiness as what we should expect from government. Trump\u2019s fiscal plan was described as dead before arrival, but approaching it this way is a mistake. Many of the steep cuts in programs for Americans mimic reductions passed before by Republicans in the House of Representatives. There\u2019s more life in this document than the easy dismissals would suggest.",
        "Former presidents George H. W. Bush and Jimmy Carter are both over 90, and still with us \u2014 making it just barely conceivable that John F. Kennedy might have lived to celebrate his 100th birthday on Monday, if he had not been assassinated in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963. Surely JFK would have noted a contrast between his Jan. 20, 1961, Inaugural Address and that of his succcessor Donald Trump exactly 56 years later. \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country,\u201d Kennedy instructed.",
        "REPUBLICANS SOLD the American Health Care Act (AHCA) the Obamacare plan that the House passed last month, with a number of untruths, chief among them that Obamacare is collapsing and the GOP effort is nothing short of a rescue plan. The Congressional Budget Office, Congress\u2019s official scorekeeper, found Wednesday that the Republicans\u2019 bill is no such thing. Not only would it result in 23 million more people lacking health insurance in a decade, but it would destabilize some states\u2019 individual insurance markets for all but relatively healthy people.",
        "It\u2019s a simple question, but for Republicans in Congress, it\u2019s not an easy one. Do you trust President Trump\u2019s judgment on major decisions? \u201cI\u2019m not answering questions like that,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Flake ( .) after hopping off an underground tram shuttling him from the Capitol to his Senate office building. \u201cThat\u2019s ah \u2026 \u201d he trailed off as he walked toward an elevator. Four seconds later, the easygoing Arizonan picked back up: \u201cThe president is overseas. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re allowed to ask any questions while the president\u2019s overseas.",
        "This story has been updated to include Carrier\u2019s response Carrier, the company President Trump pledged to keep on American soil, informed the state of Indiana this week that it will soon begin cutting 632 workers from an Indianapolis factory. The manufacturing jobs will move to Monterrey, Mexico, where the minimum wage is $3. 90. That was never supposed to happen, according to Trump\u2019s campaign promises. He told Indiana residents at a rally last year there was a \u201d100 percent chance\u201d he would save the jobs at the heating and manufacturer.",
        "President Trump\u2019s 2018 spending plan landed in front of the House Budget Committee on Wednesday, where Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney heard plenty of criticism of the blueprint \u2014 mainly from Democrats, with one outspoken exception.",
        "In an interview released Wednesday, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson said that a \u201dcertain mindset\u201d contributes to people living in poverty, pointing to habits and a \u201dstate of mind\u201d that children take from their parents at a young age. \u201dI think poverty to a large extent is also a state of mind.",
        "Does this sound familiar? Betsy DeVos went to Capitol Hill to testify before U. S. lawmakers. She didn\u2019t answer a lot of direct questions and engaged in some contentious debates with some members. That happened in January when she went before the Senate Education Committee for her confirmation hearing, during which she said schools needed guns to protect against grizzly bears.",
        "During the Trumps\u2019 meeting with Pope Francis on Wednesday, first lady Melania Trump wore a Dolce and Gabbana black dress and a black veil, following a tradition of many first ladies before her to wear black when meeting the pope. The other women in attendance, including Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, wore similar dresses and veils. There was some confusion, however, over why the first lady wore a veil \u2014 or a mantilla \u2014 at the Vatican while she didn\u2019t wear a headscarf in the Muslim country of Saudi Arabia.",
        "President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, turned over 305 pages of documents related to the investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election to the House and Senate intelligence committees this week, according to people familiar with the ongoing inquiries. Manafort\u2019s submission came in response to letters the congressional panels sent in recent weeks to a handful of Trump campaign associates with potential ties to Moscow, a sign that lawmakers were starting to dig deeper for details as newly appointed special counsel Robert S. Mueller III assumes leadership of a separate Justice Department inquiry.",
        "White House Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney on Wednesday said that tax receipts were coming in \u201cslower than expected\u201d and that the federal government could run out of cash sooner than it had thought. Mulvaney\u2019s comments, which came during a House Budget Committee hearing, resurrected an issue that Congress has mostly ignored in recent months but that will soon force some tough political decisions. A few hours later, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin echoed these concerns, telling another House committee, \u201cI urge you raise the debt limit before you leave for the summer."
