        "A small Christian school in western Maryland is not backing down from its decision to ban a pregnant senior from walking at graduation next week. Despite a public outcry and growing pressure from national antiabortion groups to reconsider, Heritage Academy in Hagerstown says that senior Maddi Runkles broke the school\u2019s rules by engaging in intimate sexual activity. In a letter to parents Tuesday evening, school principal David R. Hobbs said that Runkles is being disciplined, \u201cnot because she is pregnant but because she was immoral. . ..",
        "Military police march in a parade celebrating the 1, 000th birthday of Hanoi. (Kevin German) Photographer Kevin German has started a crowdfunding campaign to publish an unusual book about Vietnam. German spoke to In Sight about the book: \u201cI lived in Vietnam for five years, but photographed the country for 10. While tourists littered the coastline and donned conical hats for selfies, I sought a time long past. I came to see Vietnam as a bit of a dark fairy tale or a film noir where I romanticize the nostalgia that I never knew.",
        "Investigators are focusing on a series of meetings held by Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s and an influential White House adviser, as part of their probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and related matters, according to people familiar with the investigation. Kushner, who held meetings in December with the Russian ambassador and a banker from Moscow, is being investigated because of the extent and nature of his interactions with the Russians, the people said.",
        "BRUSSELS \u2014 President Trump exported the confrontational, nationalist rhetoric of his campaign across the Atlantic on Thursday, scolding European leaders for not footing more of the bill for their own defense and lecturing them to stop taking advantage of U. S. taxpayers. Speaking in front of a twisted shard of the World Trade Center at NATO\u2019s gleaming new headquarters in Brussels, Trump upbraided America\u2019s longtime allies for \u201cnot paying what they should be paying.",
        "At a NATO ceremony in Brussels on Thursday, President Trump appeared, in a moment captured on video, to push aside another world leader to get a spot at the front. That prompted pundits to joke that after eight years of Barack Obama\u2019s cautious foreign policy, the United States was no longer \u201cleading from behind. \u201d But Trump\u2019s remarks at the event celebrating the Article 5 mutual defense treaty left the impression of a president who continues to lead from the side \u2014 with one foot in and one foot out when it comes to U. S. multilateral commitments.",
        "Thanks to an awkward coincidence, President Trump is in Brussels at the same time as predecessor Barack Obama is in Berlin. These two trips are certainly offering contrasting views of the United States\u2019s relationship with Europe. Obama was in the German capital Thursday morning to appear alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a biennual festival organized by the German protestant church. The two spoke in front of a large crowd at the iconic Brandenburg Gate, with Obama going out of his way to praise Merkel.",
        "A federal appeals court on Thursday left in place the freeze on President Trump\u2019s revised entry ban, handing the administration another legal setback in its efforts to block the issuance of new visas to citizens of six countries. The broad, decisive ruling from the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit means the Trump administration still cannot enforce its travel order that the government says is urgently needed for national security. Attorney General Jeff Sessions vowed to appeal to the Supreme Court.",
        "BOZEMAN, Mont. \u2014 As Montanans headed to the polls to elect their lone U. S. House member Thursday, Democrats prepared to claim victory no matter the outcome. A win for the Democrat, Rob Quist, would give his party its first major victory during the Trump presidency \u2014 and deliver a House seat held by Republicans for more than 20 years. A victory for Greg Gianforte, if narrower than President Trump\u2019s victory last fall, would be spun as fresh evidence of GOP decline.",
        "To many observers on the left, the initial embrace of Seth Rich conspiracy theories by conservative media figures was merely a confirmation of the right\u2019s deformed soul. But for those of us who remember that Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity were once relatively mainstream Reaganites, their extended vacation in the fever swamps is even more disturbing. If once you knew better, the indictment is deeper. The cruel exploitation of the memory of Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer who was shot dead last summer, was horrifying and clarifying.",
        "Aya Hijazi learned three years ago that being an American citizen can get you thrown in jail on charges in Egypt \u2014 a country that claims to be a staunch American ally and accepts billions of dollars in U. S. aid. Then she learned that being an American unjustly imprisoned abroad won\u2019t necessarily get you any help or attention from the world\u2019s most powerful government, even if it has plenty of leverage. The State Department might just prefer to keep quiet rather than rock the boat with that supposed ally. Finally, Hijazi discovered that when a U. S.",
        "The Manchester terrorist attack by an alleged Islamic State \u201csoldier\u201d will accelerate the push by the United States and its allies to capture the terrorist group\u2019s strongholds in Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria. But it should also focus some urgent discussions about a State strategy for stabilizing the two countries. For all of President Trump\u2019s bombast about obliterating the Islamic State, the Raqqa campaign has been delayed for months while U. S. policymakers debated the wisdom of relying on a Syrian Kurdish militia known as the YPG that Turkey regards as a terrorist group.",
        "\u201cWhom the gods would destroy, they first tempt to resolve the conflict. \u201d \u2014 Irving Kristol The quixotic American pursuit of Middle East peace is a perennial. It invariably fails, yet every administration feels compelled to give it a try. The Trump administration is no different. It will fail as well. To be sure, no great harm has, as yet, come from President Trump\u2019s enthusiasm for what would be \u201cthe ultimate deal. \u201d It will, however, distract and detract from remarkable progress being made elsewhere in the Middle East.",
        "This week\u2019s bombing in Manchester, England, was another gruesome reminder that the threat from radical Islamist terrorism is ongoing. And President Trump\u2019s journey to the Middle East illustrated yet again how the country central to the spread of this terrorism, Saudi Arabia, has managed to evade and deflect any responsibility for it. In fact, Trump has given Saudi Arabia a free pass and a free hand in the region. The facts are . For five decades, Saudi Arabia has spread its narrow, puritanical and intolerant version of Islam \u2014 originally practiced almost nowhere else \u2014 across the Muslim world.",
        "PRESIDENT TRUMP\u2019S distorted foreign policy was exemplified this week in the contrast between his meeting with Arab autocrats, on whom he lavished goodwill, and U. S. NATO allies, whom he harshly and publicly critiqued. Last weekend, Mr. Trump promised Saudi Arabia and other Sunni dictatorships that they \u201cwill never question our support,\u201d adding, \u201cWe are not here to lecture. \u201d But on Thursday he declined to restate the U. S. commitment to defend its democratic European allies if they are attacked, as Article 5 of the NATO treaty provides. Instead, Mr.",
        "LONDON \u2014 President Trump on Thursday denounced U. S. leaks about Britain\u2019s investigation of the Manchester terrorist bombing as \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d and asked the Justice Department and other agencies to launch a full investigation. Leaks from the ongoing probe \u2014 including the publication of photos in the New York Times and the naming of the suspected bomber by U. S. broadcasters \u2014 have provoked ire from British officials. In response to the disclosures, British police investigating the Manchester attack took the highly unusual step of withholding information from U. S. agencies, which they say are responsible for the leaks.",
        "Senate Republicans are threatening to change a custom that allows Democratic senators to block some judicial choices from their states, in an effort to speed along a conservative transformation of the federal judiciary. Leaders are considering a change to the Senate\u2019s \u201cblue slip\u201d practice, which holds that judicial nominations will not proceed unless the nominee\u2019s senators signal their consent to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Republicans say they will make the change if Democrats throw up blanket opposition to President Trump\u2019s nominees. Adherence to the custom has waxed and waned, depending on the views of Senate leaders.",

You don\u2019t want high school seniors with perfect grades to march across the graduation stage because they\u2019re pregnant or bared their shoulders? You don\u2019t want thousands of tweens and teens dancing in an estrogen haze of girlpower at an Ariana Grande concert? Manworld tried extra hard to tell women \u201cno\u201d this week.

        "IRBIL, Iraq \u2014 A U. S. airstrike carried out on a building in Mosul in March detonated a cache of Islamic State explosives, killing more than 100 Iraqi civilians, the Pentagon said Thursday. An unclassified summary of the U. S. military investigation into the March 17 incident determined that the bomb used in the strike set off additional explosives that were placed in the building by the Islamic State, causing the collapse of the structure. The blast killed two Islamic State snipers and 105 civilians, including four in an adjacent house in western Mosul\u2019s district, the summary said.",
        "Wisconsin is preparing to recast its Medicaid program in ways that no state has ever done, requiring adults to undergo drug screening to qualify for health coverage and setting time limits on assistance unless they work or train for a job. The approach places BadgerCare, as the Wisconsin version of Medicaid is known, at the forefront of a movement by Republican governors and legislatures that is injecting a brand of moralism and individual responsibility into the nation\u2019s largest source of public health insurance.",

The Facebook CEO\u00c2 and famous college dropout left the Ivy League university\u00c2 12 years ago to found the social network, \u00c2 but he returned Thursday to pick up a honorary doctor of laws degree and drop some wisdom on the class of 2017.

        "The least likely people you\u2019d expect to feel bad for embattled White House press secretary Sean Spicer are those who are most often subject to his temper. So it came as a surprise to some on Wednesday when Spicer received an outpouring of sympathy from the press. The reason: As President Trump met with Pope Francis at the Vatican, the Catholic Spicer was noticeably absent from the entourage. Those in attendance included first lady Melania Trump, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, national security adviser H. R.",
        "Cody Xiong cracked open his door, saw the investigator on his porch and \u2019fessed up, authorities say. I guess, ? Xiong said, you are here for the opium. ? The investigator wasn\u2019t. But suddenly, he was intrigued. What\u00c2 followed was a massive opium bust, based entirely on a North Carolina poppy grower who thought prematurely that the jig was up. His field contained about $500 million worth of poppy plants, authorities said. Xiong is charged with manufacturing a Schedule II drug and trafficking in opium, both felonies.",
        "Blue whales are the most massive animals to exist in the history of animals. Dreadnoughtus and those other thundering, dinosaurs? Bantamweights next to one of today\u2019s Balaenoptera musculus. \u201cWe truly live in an age of giants,\u201d said Nicholas D. Pyenson, an expert in the paleobiology of marine mammals at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of Natural History. Blue whales, he said, can grow as long as three city buses parked end to end. Living blue whales would be even bigger, too, if it weren\u2019t for the sailors who killed most of the 100 years ago.",
        "Minnesota state Rep. Mary Franson received a note from a friend last year urging her to draft stricter legislation against female genital mutilation. The state already had banned the practice in 1994, so the Republican worried that a new law would seem \u201cIslamophobic,\u201d given its target audience. One case changed her mind. Federal prosecutors last month charged three Michigan doctors with putting two Minnesota girls under the knife. The parents of one girl \u2014 ostensibly complicit in the procedure \u2014 lost custody \u201cfor a whopping 72 hours,\u201d Franson told lawmakers on the floor of the Minnesota statehouse last week.",
        "There are classic diner burgers, with thin patties smashed on griddles, and there are burgers, the kind made with truffles and beef.

        "Jared Kushner and Russia\u2019s ambassador to Washington discussed the possibility of setting up a secret and secure communications channel between Trump\u2019s transition team and the Kremlin, using Russian diplomatic facilities in an apparent move to shield their discussions from monitoring, according to U. S. officials briefed on intelligence reports. Ambassador Sergei Kislyak reported to his superiors in Moscow that Kushner, and confidant to Trump, made the proposal during a meeting on Dec. 1 or 2 at Trump Tower, according to intercepts of Russian communications that were reviewed by U. S. officials.",
        "The Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race, has asked President Trump\u2019s political organization to gather and produce all documents, emails and phone records going back to his campaign\u2019s launch in June 2015, according to two people briefed on the request.

Trump is considering remaining in the 2015 Paris environmental accord, a decision that would be a striking turnabout for a president who during his campaign pledged to scrap the agreement and has routinely labeled climate change a \u201choax. \u201d \u201cHis views are evolving,\u201d said National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, who accompanied Trump at the summit.",
        "As President Trump traveled on a whirlwind trip overseas this week, top officials in Washington unveiled a series of a contradictory messages on some of his highest priorities. On Thursday morning, White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney told a Senate panel that the massive tax cut plan they hoped to move through Congress this year would be fully offset by eliminating scores of tax breaks. \u201cWe\u2019re going to lower rates we\u2019re going to simplify it but we\u2019re going to get rid of this whole host of deductions,\u201d Mulvaney said."
