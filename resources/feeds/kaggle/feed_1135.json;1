        "As Melania Trump accompanied her husband on his first foreign trip, the public got an uncommon glimpse into the first couple\u2019s dynamic. The first lady, who remained in New York when President Trump moved to Washington, was more visible than she has been during any other stretch of his presidency. She strode along, usually a pace or two behind, as he greeted dignitaries. She stood over his shoulder as he signed guest books. She ventured out on her own a few times, primarily to meet with women and children. But her foremost job was to accompany the president.",
        "A scandal involving the mortuary at Dover Air Force Base, the main point of entry for U. S. troops killed overseas, has rekindled with controversy over the care of astronaut John Glenn\u2019s body. On Monday, the Air Force reassigned the mortuary branch chief at the base in Delaware and opened an investigation into whether he improperly offered to allow a team of inspectors to view the embalmed corpse of Glenn, a former senator from Ohio.

        "How do you know when the country is really in trouble? When you\u2019re rooting for Goldman Sachs alumni to have more influence in the White House. A showdown is fast approaching, and the health of the global financial system is at stake. U. S. Treasury bonds are seen as the safest of safe assets; even the smallest insinuation that we might not make good on these IOUs could set off a chain reaction of panic and chaos throughout the world. This is precisely why the debt ceiling so often gets taken hostage, of course.",
        "What\u2019s the standard line on President Trump these days? That he\u2019s an erratic creature of no fixed commitments and no stable policy objectives? Not so fast. In fact, Trump\u2019s entire administration can be understood through the lens of his weird, consistent, unwavering adherence to a 1980s concept of the War on Drugs.",

        "The angry forces that propelled President Trump\u2019s rise are beginning to frame and define the rest of the Republican Party. When GOP House candidate Greg Gianforte assaulted a reporter who had attempted to ask him a question Wednesday night in Montana, many saw not an isolated outburst by an individual, but the obvious, violent result of Trump\u2019s charge that journalists are \u201cthe enemy of the people. \u201d Nonetheless, Gianforte won Thursday\u2019s special election to fill a safe Republican seat. \u201cRespectfully, I\u2019d submit that the president has unearthed some demons,\u201d Rep.
