        "Summer for Americans is a time of backyard barbecues, baseball and beer. Memorial Day weekend is a perfect chance to sit outside with the season\u2019s first sixer, and the varieties of beer you can pick up at the local grocer have multiplied. \u201cThis is a golden age for beer lovers,\u201d as The Washington Post reported in 2016. Yet the sheer number of options could confuse even the most enthusiastic consumer. No wonder myths about beer\u2019s past and present abound. Here are five. Myth No. 1 American beer is a product of the Midwest.",
        "Amid mounting questions at the White House about Russia, three prominent members of President Trump\u2019s family \u2014 his sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. and Eric\u2019s wife, Lara \u2014 have ramped up their engagement with the Republican Party\u2019s national political operation, having met privately with GOP leaders to share their concerns and outlook. Their most recent effort came Thursday, when the president\u2019s eldest sons and Lara Trump visited the Republican National Committee\u2019s headquarters in Washington.",
        "Democrats received a strong reminder from Montana voters that it takes more than just liberal outrage against President Trump and the GOP agenda to win seats that lean toward Republicans. It takes serious candidates and a policy agenda of their own. Their nominee, Rob Quist, hailed by liberal activists as a cowboy poet, delivered what most observers in Washington felt was an average performance in a race that was closely watched even before the Republican nominee was charged with assaulting a reporter on the eve of Thursday\u2019s special election.",
        "NEWCASTLE, Okla. \u2014 A deepening budget crisis here has forced schools across the Sooner State to make painful decisions. Class sizes have ballooned, art and programs have shrunk or disappeared, and with no money for new textbooks, children go without. Perhaps the most significant consequence: Students in scores of districts are now going to school just four days a week. The shift not only upends what has long been a fundamental rhythm of life for families and communities.",
        "Former vice president Joe Biden opened his address Saturday at Cornell University\u2019s senior class convocation with some lighter topics. He drew easy laughs by mentioning his love of ice cream. He played to the crowd by praising the beauty of Upstate New York. And then, with a single line about five minutes into the speech \u2014 \u201cNo graduating class gets to choose the world into which they graduate \u2026 \u201d \u2014 Biden signaled he was about to step out of meme mode and turn to weightier topics.",
        "Jim Bunning, a Hall of Fame pitcher who once threw a perfect game and who took his intimidating, combative style from the baseball diamond to Capitol Hill as a Republican member of the House of Representatives and later as a U. S. senator from Kentucky, died May 26 at a hospice facility in northern Kentucky. He was 85. His former chief of staff, Jon Deuser, confirmed the death. The cause was complications from a stroke several months ago. Mr.",
        "SAN SALVADOR \u201d Late one Sunday night in February, El Salvador s secretary of culture alerted the world to a cowardly and inhumane attack. ? The perpetrators had used severe and overwhelming blows. ? A beloved national figure was gone. Gustavito, the lone hippopotamus at the National Zoo of El Salvador, had been killed. It takes a lot to shock El Salvador, one of the world s most violent countries, but Gustavito s death had done it. Tens of thousands of mourners streamed into the zoo, a leafy enclave in southern San Salvador, to pay their respects.",
        "Three days after declaring martial law in the rebellious southern Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte ordered his troops to crush the militants, and gave a speech to inspire them: \u201cYou can arrest any person, search any house,\u201d Duterte told the soldiers Friday. \u201cI alone would be responsible\u201d for anything they did under martial law, he said. \u201cI will go to jail for you. If you happen to have raped three women, I will own up to it.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be our own indie movie,\u201d I quipped to a couple of strangers inside the Alaskan, a vintage former brothel that doubles as a hotel and a dive bar in downtown Juneau. The premise was a stretch, even for fiction. I flew from Portland, Ore. to Juneau, Alaska, for an impromptu road trip from Northwestern British Columbia back down through Washington state. My camping buddy would be a Grindr stand from three years ago. I had seen this guy only twice since our hookup, both times platonic with months in between. My friends thought I was crazy.",
        "While you ve got the grill fired up this weekend, we think it s a good idea to let your dessert spend some time over the flames as well. Here are a few ideas from the Recipe Finder. Happy grilling. [Burgers, chicken, lamb belly and more meaty mains for Memorial Day] S more Better Dip, pictured above. S mores for a crowd.

        "\u2018I feel like I\u2019m always in a battle with my feet,\u201d says Lauren Lovette, with a sigh. One of New York City Ballet\u2019s principal ballerinas, Lovette has beautifully arched, supple feet, and often, they\u2019re killing her. After years of sprains and other injuries, she underwent surgery to correct a bone anomaly, but even with physical therapy, daily ankle exercises, ice baths and ointments, the still hasn\u2019t made peace with her feet. Lovette shares this struggle with many dancers, whose feet take sustained abuse, and in the worst kind of footwear (or none at all).",
        "LONDON \u2014 German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday declared a new chapter in U. S. relations after contentious meetings with President Trump last week, saying that Europe \u201creally must take our fate into our own hands. \u201d It was the toughest review yet of Trump\u2019s trip to Europe, which inflamed tensions rather than healed them after the U. S. president sparred with the leaders of Washington\u2019s closest and oldest allies on trade, defense and climate change.",
        "German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a crowd Sunday in southern Germany that Europe can no longer rely on foreign partners. Merkel on Sunday declared a new chapter in U. S. relations after contentious meetings with President Trump last week, saying that Europe \u201creally must take our fate into our own hands. \u201d Offering a tough review in the wake of Trump\u2019s trip to visit E. U. NATO and Group of Seven leaders last week, Merkel told a packed Bavarian beer hall rally that the days when Europe could rely on others was \u201cover to a certain extent.",
        "The Trump administration argued over the weekend that communications are acceptable in building dialogue with foreign governments, part of an effort to minimize fallout over White House adviser Jared Kushner\u2019s reported discussion about creating a secret conduit to the Kremlin at a Russian diplomatic compound. But some former administration officials on Sunday criticized the use of such secret channels, especially during a presidential transition, saying they could send a confusing message and be manipulated by a foreign power. Democrats raised new concerns about Kushner.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 On the first day of her new job as the creative director of Anne Klein two years ago, Sharon Lombardo arrived at the company\u2019s midtown offices and was greeted by . . . no one. There was no receptionist to escort her to a design studio, because there was no studio. There wasn\u2019t even an Anne Klein sign confirming that she was in the right place. Where were the office supplies, she wondered? Heck, where was the bathroom?",
        "Nearly 200 teachers have quit their jobs in D. C. Public Schools since the school year began, forcing principals to scramble to cover their classes with substitutes and depriving many students of quality instruction in critical subjects. The vacancies hit hardest in schools that already face numerous academic challenges, according to data The Washington Post obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. At Ballou High School in Southeast Washington, more than a quarter of the faculty quit after starting work in August. Many of their classrooms now have substitutes.",
        "A substantial majority of the judges who sit on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond delivered a rather remarkable judgment last week: The president of the United States is not to be believed. Will the Supreme Court conclude the same thing? And by \u201cSupreme Court,\u201d we mean \u201cJustice Anthony M. Kennedy,\u201d whose name was invoked 23 times in the 205 pages of majority opinions, concurrences and dissents in the appeals court\u2019s rejection of President Trump\u2019s revised travel ban.",
        "President Trump returned home Saturday night to a country wondering how he would address a crisis of bad news that has only grown more dire during his tour abroad. As the FBI continues an investigation of Trump\u2019s top associates and as he reportedly considers a White House staff the president\u2019s attorneys have urged him to lay off his habit of aggressive and impulsive tweeting \u2014 lest it make matters even worse for him. So what did Trump do upon returning to his embattled White House? He went on a Twitter rant, of course. Big win in Montana for Republicans!",
        "For students across the country, the traditional trip to Washington is a chance to join the throngs on the Mall and perhaps spot some of the world\u2019s most powerful people on the grounds of the U. S. Capitol. But a group from South Orange Middle School in New Jersey may remember their trip to the nation\u2019s capital last week for another reason: It was the occasion for a pointed snub of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( . ).",
        "Even before their names were released, one word repeatedly came up to describe the men who were killed in a stabbing Friday on a train in Portland, Ore.: heroes. They had tried to intervene, police said, after another passenger began \u201cranting and raving\u201d and shouting insults at two young women. That\u2019s when the ranting passenger turned his anger toward those who sought to calm him down. He fatally stabbed two men and seriously injured a third, police said, before fleeing the train on foot.",
        "Scott Dixon and Jay Howard avoided serious injury in a spectacular crash \u2014 or what Dixon labeled \u201ca wild ride\u201d afterward \u2014 during the Indianapolis 500 on Sunday. The crash occurred on Lap 53 when Howard\u2019s car bounced off the outside wall, apparently crushing his right front suspension. Dixon then went over the top of Howard\u2019s car as he tried to get past and he became airborne, crashing into the safety fencing. A photographer behind the fencing appeared to suffer minor injuries.",
        "OSAKA, Japan \u2014 The country suffered a \u201clost decade,\u201d and then another one, after its bubble burst some 25 years ago. To this day, despite Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s efforts to reinvigorate it, Japan\u2019s economy remains in the doldrums. Now, experts are warning of a \u201clost generation\u201d \u2014 a whole tier of Japanese children who are growing up in families where the parents \u2014 or, often, a single parent \u2014 work but do not earn enough to break through the poverty line.",
        "They thought it would be funny: During lunch, the boys threw peanuts at a fellow student with severe food allergies. The Los Angeles area was so sensitive to nuts that exposure might send him to the emergency room. He said: \u201cNo, stop. That could kill me. \u201d When he turned away to talk to a friend, one of the boys stashed peanuts in the container that held his lunch. Seeing the nasty trick, the allergic boy\u2019s friends quickly grabbed the container and threw it away, possibly saving their friend from a terrible incident.",
        "Designer Amy Zantzinger styled her family\u2019s waterside retreat to be an elegant yet casual farmhouse. No country cliches here: Her look combines rustic farm tables, lanterns and antique weather vanes with contemporary lighting and white marble bathrooms. [A modern take on a Shaker farmhouse gives a family a relaxing river retreat] Here are some of her ideas for getting the modern farmhouse look: Paint most of the rooms in the same white paint.

        "Reader: My boss, who is about 60, is so disorganized that I wonder if he has dementia. He can\u2019t remember what assignments he\u2019s given, what conversations he\u2019s had or what deadlines were agreed upon. He\u2019ll insist he never received a document he asked for and look truly confused if you offer proof you sent it. He\u2019ll tell you to do something and then insist to the point of rage that he did not tell you to do it. When I started working for him almost a year ago, I thought he was a jerk.",
        "To a casual observer, the game of squash looks easy. Contested in an enclosed court, players serve the ball toward the back wall and aim to hit the ball before it bounces twice and also make their opponent miss the ball. The first person to 11 points wins. Pretty simple, right? But to those who love the game, squash is a rigorous endeavor, both physically and mentally.",
        "President Trump consumes classified intelligence like he does most everything else in life: ravenously and impatiently, eager to ingest glinting nuggets but often indifferent to subtleties. Most mornings, often at 10:30, sometimes earlier, Trump sits behind the historic Resolute desk and, with a fresh Diet Coke fizzing and papers piled high, receives updates on the world\u2019s hot spots. The president interrupts his briefers with questions but also with random asides. He asks that the top brass of the intelligence community be present, and he demands brevity.",
        "To believe Donald Trump, you must believe two largely contradictory things. You must believe that there are a slew of leakers in the executive branch who are providing damning details to the press illegally, and who must be rooted out and punished. (See tweets here, here, here, here and here.) You must also believe that the press makes up imaginary leakers simply to slowly and incrementally report false stories that are tangentially embarrassing to the president.",
        "The Trump administration is planning to disband the Labor Department division that has policed discrimination among federal contractors for four decades, according to the White House\u2019s newly proposed budget, part of wider efforts to rein in government programs that promote civil rights. As outlined in Labor\u2019s fiscal 2018 plan, the move would fold the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, now home to 600 employees, into another government agency in the name of .",
        "PARIS \u2014 French President Emmanuel Macron delivered a blunt greeting to Vladi mir Putin on Monday, criticizing the use of chemical weapons by Syria\u2019s government and blasting two Russian media organizations as \u201corgans of influence and propaganda. \u201d Macron had invited the Russian leader to France to reset a relationship that has turned increasingly sour. Putin did more than any other foreign leader to undermine Macron\u2019s legitimacy in this country\u2019s recent presidential election, meeting with his opponent during the campaign."
