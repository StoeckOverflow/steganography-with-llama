        "As Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived at the Versailles Palace on Monday to meet Emmanuel Macron, the recently elected leader of France, all eyes were on the handshake. Macron had surprised the world last week with his grasp of President Trump\u2019s hand when the pair met for the first time. Trump had already gained notoriety for his handshake, a vigorous tug that has caught some world leaders off guard. The French president, however, came prepared. Though Trump leaned in first, he tried to release his hand from the lengthy shake, twice, while Macron kept squeezing.",
        "White House press secretary Sean Spicer was giddy at the thought of meeting Pope Francis during President Trump\u2019s first trip abroad, telling acquaintances that for him, a devout Catholic, the moment would fulfill a dream. But when the White House finalized the lucky list of staff and family members who would accompany Trump into his private audience with the pontiff at the Vatican last week, Spicer\u2019s name was nowhere to be found.",
        "Lawmakers scuffled on the floor of the Texas House of Representatives on Monday after a Republican told Democrats that he called Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers on protesters in the House gallery. \u201cWe were just on the floor talking about the SB4 protests, and [state Rep.] Matt Rinaldi came up to us and made it a point to say, \u2018I called (ICE) on all of them,\u2019 \u201d state Rep. Philip Cortez (D) said. \u201cAnd this is completely unacceptable. We will not be intimidated. We will not be disrespected.",
        "\u201cBack channels\u201d have been used by every modern president, from John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama. If that\u2019s so, what\u2019s the problem with the contacts between White House adviser Jared Kushner and two Russian intermediaries? It\u2019s a fair question. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the right answer is a reflexive approval of Kushner\u2019s contacts, as offered Sunday by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, who said of such offline communication: \u201cIt\u2019s both normal, in my opinion, and acceptable. \u201d The devil here, as in most things, is in the details.",
        "Nathan Fletcher, a professor of practice in political science at the University of California at San Diego, is a combat veteran of the U. S. Marine Corps. This Memorial Day, we honor Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice and gave their lives during service to their country. This recognition should include veterans who survived war but could not survive the peace that followed because of very real mental injuries suffered in combat. At least 20 veterans commit suicide every day in the United States. These are lives lost to war, and we must account for them today.",
        "It was supposed to go much more smoothly than this. During the 2016 campaign, Republicans uneasy with Donald Trump told themselves that the real action would be in Congress, where their dreams would finally be realized. Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell would pass one sweeping bill after another to put conservative ideology into practice, and Trump would sign them all, because everyone knew he didn\u2019t care about policy. He might say crazy stuff and even make some questionable decisions, but the legislative train would keep chugging along, making it all worthwhile. But it\u2019s not working out that way.",
        "The Department of Veterans Affairs has a woman problem. Need evidence? Look no further than its motto: \u201cTo care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow, and his orphan. \u201d That motto \u2014 engraved on plaques outside VA buildings across the country, featured proudly in VA presentations and on the agency\u2019s website \u2014 comes from President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Second Inaugural Address. It was an eloquent and statement in its time. But the face of U. S. troops, and veterans, has drastically changed since then.",
        "When Ricky Best and Taliesin boarded a train in Portland, Ore. on Friday night, they never could have imagined they wouldn\u2019t make it home. The two men were stabbed to death after confronting a man for yelling slurs at a Muslim woman and her friend. A third intervener, Micah is being treated for serious, injuries. The suspect, a white supremacist known to police, openly performed Nazi salutes and shouted racial slurs at a rally last month in Portland. White supremacist, Islamophobic and posts were a fixture on his Facebook page.",
        "I am not a big or even a little fan of President Trump. Many of his policies strike me as undesirable, some in the extreme. His background and temperament have not prepared him for the presidency. He is largely ignorant of many issues he must face. And yet, for all this, the idea of impeaching him and removing him from office, which inspires much loose chatter, makes me extraordinarily uneasy. We Americans take enormous pride in our political system, even while we disparage and distrust our politicians.",
        "As they campaign against each other ahead of national elections in September, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her chief political rival, Martin Schulz, find themselves united in opposition to President Trump. Speaking at a beer hall rally in Munich on Sunday, Merkel suggested that the era when Europe could rely on the United States may be coming to an end and that the continent \u201creally must take our fate into our own hands. \u201d After recent summits, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said May 28 that Europe must take its fate into its own hands.",
        "Sometime in the next few weeks, four Democratic lawyers and four Republican ones will file into the ornate Lyndon Baines Johnson Room just steps from the Senate chamber at the Capitol to consider a bill to overhaul the Affordable Care Act. They\u2019ll sit at a long table before someone unknown to most Americans but with singular power to influence whether Republicans can follow through on their quest to remake President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement. That person is Elizabeth MacDonough \u2014 the Senate parliamentarian, who is charged with acting as Congress\u2019s version of a referee in the contentious debate.",
        "MOSUL, Iraq \u2014 On the front lines, the jagged teeth of a young soldier\u2019s bulldozer mark the beginning of Iraq\u2019s territory and the end of the Islamic State\u2019s. Pvt. Mohammed Ali is 19, weathered and lean. He has been shot at, rocketed and mortared while trying to protect the troops behind him. Using his cellphone, he captured one particularly harrowing moment, when a car bomb engulfed his armored behemoth in flames and shrapnel. The video went viral.",
        "Denver Post publisher Mac Tully and editor Lee Ann Colacioppo issued a statement on Monday that sportswriter Terry Frei is no longer an employee of the newspaper one day after he tweeted that he was \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d with Japanese driver Takuma Sato winning the Indianapolis 500 during Memorial Day weekend. \u201cWe apologize for the disrespectful and unacceptable tweet that was sent by one of our reporters,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cTerry Frei is no longer an employee of The Denver Post. It\u2019s our policy not to comment further on personnel issues.",
        "Things got a little bit heated in the eighth inning of the Nationals\u2019 game vs. the Giants on Memorial Day. With two outs and nobody on, Bryce Harper stepped to the plate and awaited the pitch from San Francisco reliever Hunter Strickland. That pitch came directly, and deliberately, at Harper\u2019s body. And then this happened . . . Bryce Harper charges the mound after being hit by Hunter Strickland pic. twitter. \u2014 Barno (@DCBarno) May 29, 2017 Another view pic. twitter. \u2014 John Middlekauff (@JohnMiddlekauff) May 29, 2017 Strickland\u2019s first pitch hits Harper.",
        "Frank Deford practically invented the notion of multimedia: He exported his voice to radio, TV and film, and if you didn\u2019t know him you might have thought he was an actor, because he wore purple suits and looked like Clark Gable. But Frank, who died Sunday at age 78, was a writer above all things, and an important one. His work, most of which appeared in Sports Illustrated, was identified by two qualities that made it important. The first was sincerity, which is a form of truthfulness.",
        "On Monday, March 19, 1917, three Americans strapped into the cockpits of their biplanes on a French airfield, and embarked on a reconnaissance mission. The United States was weeks away from declaring war on Germany and entering World War I. But these Americans, natives of Illinois, New York and Massachusetts, had sailed to France to aid the country in its conflict with Germany. The American trio, members of an elite squadron known as the Lafayette Escadrille, quickly got into trouble. One had a faulty engine and turned around.",
        "Cecil Exum figures he s made 130 omelets by now, but honestly, he s lost track. It s five hours into his shift, and he s just realized he hasn t had his morning coffee. The crowds keep coming, asking for omelets, fried eggs and waffles, so he keeps cooking. Now three more omelets are sizzling on the stove. He pats each one with a rubber spatula and flips them, with a slight flick of his wrist: One, two, three. For mercy s sake! ? says Sally McGinnis, 58, a longtime customer from Clover, S. C.",
        "During the Obama administration, Education Secretary Arne Duncan got pretty steamed at people who opposed his school reform efforts, especially his support for the Common Core State Standards. In 2013, for example, he went after Core critics, telling a group of state schools superintendents: \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating to me that some of the pushback is coming from, sort of, white suburban moms who \u2014 all of a sudden \u2014 their child isn\u2019t as brilliant as they thought they were and their school isn\u2019t quite as good as they thought they were, and that\u2019s pretty scary.",
        "LONDON \u2014 President Trump escalated his feud with Berlin on Tuesday, even as Germany\u2019s leader and Trump\u2019s own spokesman tried to defuse the conflict, which has sent tremors through Washington\u2019s core postwar alliances. Before the presidential tweets began flying early Tuesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel reaffirmed the importance of Germany\u2019s ties to the United States. But she pointedly did not back down from earlier comments about Europe\u2019s need to rely on itself rather than its friends. The dispute started as Trump sped through meetings in Europe last week and appeared to leave a trail of bruises in his wake.",
        "To most observers, President Trump\u2019s first overseas trip was either a moderate success that was at times overshadowed by viral GIFs or a disaster that damaged the United States\u2019 relationships with longtime European allies. But as Trump and his aides tell it, this was the most successful, most historic, most foreign trip ever embarked on by a U. S. president.",
        "President Trump faces an increasingly narrow path to win major legislative victories before the looming August recess, with only two months left to revive his or tax initiatives before Congress departs for a long break. White House officials said Tuesday that Trump has become increasingly incensed that legislation is bogging down in the Senate, something they blame on Democrats. Trump wrote on Twitter that the Senate should change its rules and \u201cswitch to 51\u201d votes to pass changes and to vote on a tax bill instead of working to get 60 votes to end a potential filibuster.",
        "Congressional Republicans knew their plan was potentially explosive. They wanted to kill landmark privacy regulations that would soon ban Internet providers, such as Comcast and AT&T, from storing and selling customers\u2019 browsing histories without their express consent. So after weeks of debates on Capitol Hill over who would take up the issue first \u2014 the House or the Senate \u2014 Republican members settled on a secret strategy, according to Hill staff and lobbyists involved in the battle.",
        "Former national security adviser Michael Flynn will hand over documents and records to the Senate Intelligence Committee in response to a set of subpoenas for information from his businesses and personal files related to the committee\u2019s probe of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election, according to a person close to Flynn. Lawyers for Flynn\u2019s team sent the committee a written response Tuesday indicating that Flynn would begin providing records in response to subpoenas by June 6, the deadline to start turning over such information.",
        "Try to follow this dizzying sequence of events: On Friday, The Washington Post reported that Jared Kushner sought to create a secret line of communication between Donald Trump\u2019s transition team and the Kremlin during a meeting with Russian diplomats in December. On Saturday, national security adviser H. R. McMaster said at a news conference that he \u201cwould not be concerned\u201d about such an arrangement and added that \u201cwe have communications with a number of countries. \u201d On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly told ABC News that \u201cany channel of communications, back or otherwise, is a good thing.",
        "PORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 This Pacific Northwest city often is touted as a progressive playground and haven for liberal politics, its history of activism and civil protest a badge of honor. But the past few months have seen Portland turn into a battlefield, where anarchists and leftist demonstrators collide in the streets with activists, white nationalists and supporters of President Trump. Over Memorial Day weekend, Portland also became the most recent scene of murderous hate linked to that clash.",
        "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Major League Baseball suspended Bryce Harper four games and fined him an undisclosed amount for his actions in the fight that marred Monday afternoon\u2019s win over the Giants. Reliever Hunter Strickland, who hit him with a pitch to set off the brawl, will be suspended for six games. Both players will appeal the decision, meaning both will remain active Tuesday night. [Harper will be in the Nationals\u2019 lineup vs. Giants on Tuesday night] \u201cYou never know what Major League Baseball is going to do, or the [MLB] Players Association, or things like that,\u201d Harper said.",
        "The great thing about hiring family members: You can usually trust them more than others. The really awful thing about hiring family members: You can\u2019t fire them. Unless, of course, you\u2019re Michael Corleone. Poor Fredo. It\u2019s no mere coincidence that \u201cThe Godfather\u201d comes to mind when considering the nation\u2019s first family and challenges therein. President Trump, like Vito Corleone, has surrounded himself with family members, especially daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, and for essentially the same reasons. If you\u2019re Donald Trump, whom can you really trust?",
        "President Trump has returned to the White House to be met by a effort in crisis. He can get it back on track by embracing a solution that is obvious and equitable \u2014 and that ought to be easy. \u201cThe boldest ideas for changing the nation\u2019s tax code are either dead or on political life support,\u201d the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Richard Rubin reported Monday. \u201cThe clear winner, so far, is the status quo. \u201d That would be a disaster for the economy, of course.",
        "Noah Zatz is a professor at UCLA School of Law. As a law student learning to represent people seeking welfare benefits, I was taught that forms had to be filled out flawlessly. No crossing out words. No . No misspellings. The slightest error would provide an excuse to deny the cash needed for rent, food or a growing child\u2019s shoes. Republicans revile such bureaucratic rigidity when it inconveniences businesses or the wealthy. Yet they embrace it when it hurts the most vulnerable. We\u2019ve seen this Republican red tape with drug tests for welfare recipients and onerous requirements.",
        "Brian Deese, a senior fellow at the Center for Business and Government at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School, served as a senior adviser to President Barack Obama overseeing climate change and energy policy. Ronald A. Klain, a Post contributing columnist, was White House Ebola response coordinator from 2014 to 2015 and a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign.
