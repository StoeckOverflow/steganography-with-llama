        "Conservatives last week devoured a story by John Solomon and Sara Carter at Circa with this title, \u201cObama intel agency secretly conducted illegal searches on Americans for years. \u201d The Obama administration, noted the story, had \u201croutinely violated American privacy protections while scouring through overseas intercepts and failed to disclose the extent of the problems until the final days before Donald Trump was elected president last fall. \u201d That sort of misfeasance merited followup by the mainstream media, according to various voices on the right. NewsBusters scolded, \u201cNets Blackout Massive Constitutional Violations by Obama\u2019s NSA.",
        "NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES from President Trump\u2019s first trip abroad continue to accumulate. On Tuesday, the president chose to escalate his mostly feud with Germany and its chancellor, Angela Merkel, repeating his misguided critique of Germany\u2019s trade surplus with the United States and claiming that \u201cthey pay far less than they should\u201d for NATO. That will only confirm the conclusion of Ms. Merkel, a Atlanticist, that the days when Europe could rely on the United States are \u201cover to a certain extent. \u201d In the Middle East, meanwhile, the practical effects of Mr.",
        "The U. S. military destroyed a mock intercontinental ballistic missile thousands of miles over the Pacific for the first time Tuesday, a step forward for a program that has taken on new significance in light of North Korean threats. The midcourse defense (GMD) system used a \u201ckill vehicle\u201d released from a larger interceptor missile to obliterate the mock ICBM, defense officials said. The mock threat was launched from the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site in the Marshall Islands, and it was met by an interceptor launched from a silo at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.",
        "The Cleveland police officer who shot and killed Tamir Rice in 2014 has been fired from the police department after an investigation concluded that he withheld details of his past employment when he applied to the department months before the shooting. At a news conference Tuesday, Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson announced that Officer Timothy Loehmann, who shot Tamir, has been terminated from the department effective immediately.",
        "Virginia lawmaker Marcia Price has her lefty political idols. She broke with every other Democrat in the state legislature last year to endorse Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race. But when it comes to her state\u2019s June gubernatorial primary, Price wants her liberal heroes to butt out. \u201cThey have it wrong this time,\u201d she said, weeks after Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the progressive champion from Massachusetts, took the unusual step of backing a candidate in Virginia\u2019s Democratic primary.",
        "The Trump administration has drafted a rule that would allow religious employers to stop covering birth control in employer health plans. The mandate was one of the most controversial components of the Affordable Care Act signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010. Supporters argue that it is a basic issue of women\u2019s rights and suggest that the increased availability of safe contraceptives contributed to a decline in teen births and abortions.",
        "For nearly three months, the \u201cFearless Girl\u201d statue has stared down the \u201cCharging Bull,\u201d an iconic, monument to \u201cpeace, strength, power and love,\u201d according to the artist. This weekend, New York artist Alex Gardega decided he\u2019d had enough. While \u201cmessing around\u201d in his studio, Gardega decided to create a small sculpture of a urinating dog, which he placed beside the \u201cFearless Girl\u201d statue\u2019s left leg for several hours Monday, drawing curious and angry onlookers and unleashing the latest round the battle of Wall Street statues. The name of the sculpture: \u201cPissing Pug.",
        "SAN FRANCISCO Uber has fired Anthony Levandowski, the star engineer at the center of its legal fight over driverless cars. Levandowski, the former chief of Uber\u2019s program, was given notice on Friday, according to a termination letter obtained Tuesday by the Washington Post. The company cited his failure to comply with a judge\u2019s request that he turn over thousands of documents that he is accused of stealing from Google\u2019s parent company, where he had worked as a senior engineer in driverless cars.",
        "By the time the other zookeepers got to the tiger enclosure, screaming and throwing pieces of meat as a distraction, it was too late. Rosa King, a zookeeper at Hamerton Zoo Park, 80 miles north of London, had gotten trapped in the \u201cLand of the Tiger\u201d enclosure with at least one of the zoo\u2019s big cats, according to local police and the zoo. \u201cWe could see staff members on the other side of the fence with pieces of meat trying to get attention,\u201d visitor Victoria Northover Holmes said in a public Facebook post.",
        "A great white shark was tracked over the holiday weekend off the Delaware coast, experts said, and she has been seen recently in the waters off Chincoteague and Assateague islands in Virginia and Maryland. Ocearch. org, a shark research organization, tracked the shark \u2014 which has been named Mary Lee \u2014 on Sunday within two miles of Cape Henlopen State Park in Lewes, Del. Mary Lee, who weighs about 3, 500 pounds, was also later spotted that day along the Cape May, N. J. shore.",
        "Ryan Christopher Jones is an independent photojournalist based in New York. He contributed the following essay to In Sight: In February, I spent a month in Mexico, working in Mexico City and traveling to Oaxaca and my grandmother\u2019s birthplace of Juchipila, in the state of Zacatecas. After moving to California from Mexico in the 1940s, she worked hard to assimilate her family into an American identity, and it worked so well that I never questioned or investigated my Mexican roots. Spanish was not taught or spoken in my home, and Mexico wasn\u2019t a place with tangible meaning.",
        "The Trump administration is moving toward handing back to Russia two diplomatic compounds, near New York City and on Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore, from which its officials were ejected in late December as punishment for Moscow\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election. Barack Obama said Dec. 29 that the compounds were being \u201cused by Russian personnel for purposes,\u201d and gave Russia 24 hours to vacate them. Separately, Obama expelled from the United States what he said were 35 Russian \u201cintelligence operatives.",
        "This story has been updated. President Trump is nearing a final decision on whether to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, with one White House official saying Wednesday that the president is leaning toward an exit but three others cautioning that he has not reached a verdict. The matter has deeply divided the administration for months. Ivanka Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have urged the president to remain in the deal, and White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt have been pushing for a withdrawal.",
        "Former FBI director James B. Comey is preparing to testify to Congress as early as next week about his private conversations with President Donald Trump leading up to his abrupt firing, according to an associate of Comey\u2019s. Since his dismissal earlier this month, Comey had been expected to testify at some point about his private interactions with the president, as well as the detailed memos he took describing the conversations. Before he could testify, however, Comey had to ensure his appearance at a public hearing would not complicate the ongoing investigation of Special Counsel Robert S.",
        "JERSEY CITY \u2014 Jared Kushner and his real estate partners wanted to take advantage of a federal program in 2015 that would save them millions of dollars as they built an opulent, residential tower in this city\u2019s booming waterfront district, just across the Hudson River from Lower Manhattan. There was just one problem: The program was designed to benefit projects in poor, areas. So the project\u2019s consultants got creative, records show.",
        "KABUL \u2014 At 6:30 Wednesday morning, I left my cat snoozing on the windowsill and headed off for what promised to be a rare, pleasant departure from the depressing grind of covering warlord politics and insurgent attacks. Two hours later, I was gazing out over a marsh of rippling green reeds while an Afghan wildlife ranger pointed out a variety of migratory birds that were stopping to rest there. It was a bucolic scene on a breezy morning \u2014 and a small sign of progress for the Afghan environment.",
        "KABUL \u201d A massive blast tore through the diplomatic quarter of the Afghan capital Wednesday, killing at least 80 people and wounding more than 460, officials said. The devastation left Kabul in shock and underlined the country s security struggles as it confronts a sustained wave of insurgent and terrorist attacks. Interior Ministry officials said a huge quantity of explosives, hidden in a tanker truck, detonated at 8:30 a. m. during rush hour on a busy boulevard in the Wazir Akbar Khan district, which houses embassies, banks, supermarkets and government ministries.",
        "I took a few days off over the Memorial Day weekend for my wedding and tried not to worry about the grim headlines, most of them generated by one man: \u25cfPresident Trump, shoving a European prime minister. \u25cfTrump, picking fights with Germany and France and destabilizing the NATO alliance. \u25cfTrump, responding to the pope\u2019s plea, reportedly is ready to pull the United States out of the world pact. \u25cfTrump, tweeting gibberish \u2014 \u201ccovfefe\u201d \u2014 as investigators probing the Russia scandal queried more members of his inner circle.",
        "Most of the conservative Republicans opposed to President Trump are writers and policy specialists. Few are politicians \u2014 or, perhaps more precisely, few of the conservative politicians who see Trump as a danger to the nation are prepared to say so in public. So does this mean that the writerly right is ineffectual? Not at all. But we may be approaching a time when the gutlessness of the GOP\u2019s leadership moves these restive conservatives to abandon their traditional loyalties altogether. It would not be the first time that a group of thinkers opened the way for political realignment.",
        "In 1950, the year before William F. Buckley burst into the national conversation, the literary critic Lionel Trilling revealed why the nation was ripe for Buckley\u2019s romp through its political and cultural controversies. Liberalism, Trilling declared, was \u201cnot only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition\u201d in America because conservatism was expressed merely in \u201cirritable mental gestures. \u201d Buckley would change that by infusing conservatism with brio, bringing elegance to its advocacy and altering the nation\u2019s trajectory while having a grand time. Today, conservatism is soiled by scowling primitives whose irritable gestures lack mental ingredients.",
        "President Trump\u2019s proposed budget for fiscal 2018 is being condemned, right and left, for the cuts it imposes on various federal programs. Too little attention is being paid to the necessary economizing the Trump budget avoids \u2014 specifically, with regard to Medicare. Medicare covers physician services, hospitalization and prescription drugs for seniors over 65 (and some nonelderly disabled); in 2015, its total cost was $646. 2 billion. It was the largest federal spending item except for Social Security and national defense, accounting for 15 percent of all outlays.",
        "Why was \u201ccovfefe\u201d so funny? That nonsense word, in the unlikely event you know nothing about it, is a bit of typographical gobbledygook that came at the end of an inadvertently posted tweet by President Trump just after midnight Wednesday. The tweet began, as many of Trump\u2019s tweets do, as a complaint about hostile press coverage.",
        "As soon as his cab arrived in an Islamic State safe house in December 2015, his lawyers say, Mohamad Khweis realized he had made a huge mistake. The Fairfax County native fled the group three months later and was captured by Kurdish forces in Iraq. Now, as his trial begins this week in federal court in Alexandria, a jury will weigh whether a mistake of that gravity can be forgiven under terrorism laws. Khweis, prosecutors say, quite clearly committed the crimes of which he is accused. He knowingly offered himself up as a fighter for a bloodthirsty terrorist group.",
        "GLENDALE, Ariz. \u2014 Sen. Jeff Flake delivered a stark warning to business leaders eager to learn more about GOP plans to remake the system: It\u2019s really hard, and Republicans might not succeed. \u201cThere are some still saying that we\u2019ll vote before the August break. I have a hard time believing that,\u201d he told about 150 members of the local Chamber of Commerce here this week. Similarly, when a hospital employee asked about how to save the Medicaid program, Flake said, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find that balance, and we aren\u2019t close yet, frankly.",
        "Looks like former president Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama are putting down deeper roots in Washington: After renting a Kalorama home for their House stint, the couple have purchased the home for $8. 1 million, according to property records. The Obamas have said they plan to remain in D. C. while their younger daughter, Sasha, finishes high school at Sidwell Friends.",
        "Declaring \u201cit\u2019s time for big dreams,\u201d former vice president Joe Biden is prepared to launch a new political action committee on Thursday, a move certain to stoke more speculation about whether he plans to mount a 2020 challenge to President Trump. The new PAC, dubbed American Possibilities, is being set up to help elect candidates who, like Biden, still believe in a nation \u201cof ordinary people doing extraordinary things,\u201d according to an email the Democrat plans to send to supporters.",
        "When Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy sent TV ratings soaring last year, CBS honcho Les Moonves infamously summed up his reaction: \u201cIt may not be good for America but it\u2019s damn good for CBS. \u201d The same emphasis on corporate profits is surely the driving force behind the decision to pull Scott Pelley from the CBS Evening News anchor chair. (Moonves later sought to clarify that he was speaking about ad dollars, not ratings; but both involve the bottom line.) Pelley\u2019s tenure has been marked by his intelligent, approach to the news, pulling no punches while still remaining impartial.",
        "Reports have zinged around the Internet this week about a sudden and mysterious surge in President Trump\u2019s Twitter following, along with dark musings that something nefarious may be afoot. The wildest of these claims \u2014 including the suggestion that Trump had gained up to 5 million followers in just a few days and that nearly half are \u201cfake\u201d \u2014 are clearly overblown, analysts say. But several researchers who study social media have also reached the conclusion that something fishy may be going on with Trump\u2019s account.",
        "IN THE new film \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d our title hero leaves her empowering, island of Themyscira for the tightly corseted society of World War London. As her companions coax the warrior into trading in her leather skirt for the confining bustle of a Western world, Diana Prince has a natural question: How do you fight in this attire? The scene also reflects the challenge for the film\u2019s director, Patty Jenkins: In an industry forever plagued by sexism, she wondered, how do I succeed as the first woman to direct a superhero feature?",
        "The initial construction of the massive airplane Paul Allen has been quietly building in the California desert is complete, and the vehicle, which would be the world\u2019s largest airplane with a wingspan wider than Howard Hughes\u2019s Spruce Goose, was wheeled out of its hangar for the first time on Wednesday. Called Stratolaunch, the plane has some impressive stats: a wingspan of 385 feet, or longer than a football field, a height of 50 feet. Unfueled, it weighs 500, 000 pounds. But it can carry 250, 000 pounds of fuel, and its total weight can reach as high as 1."
