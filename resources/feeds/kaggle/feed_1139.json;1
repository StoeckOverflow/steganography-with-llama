        "President Trump announced Thursday afternoon that he is withdrawing the United States from the landmark Paris climate agreement, an extraordinary move that dismayed America\u2019s allies and set back the global effort to address the warming planet. Trump\u2019s decision set off alarms worldwide, drawing swift and sharp condemnation from foreign leaders as well as top environmentalists and corporate titans, who decried the U. S. exit from the Paris accord as an irresponsible abdication of American leadership in the face of irrefutable scientific evidence.",

Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary Ross, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, members of congress, distinguished guests, on behalf of the first family, welcome to the White House.",
        "In his speech announcing his decision to withdraw from the Paris Accord on climate change, President Trump frequently relied on dubious facts and unbalanced claims to make his case that the agreement would hurt the U. S. economy. Notably, he only looked at one side of the scale \u2014 claiming the agreement left the United States at a competitive disadvantage, harming U. S. industries. But he often ignored the benefits that could come from tackling climate change, including potential green jobs. Trump also suggested that the United States was treated unfairly under the agreement.",
        "This story has been updated. President Trump railed against the Paris climate agreement in the White House Rose Garden on Thursday, but it was hard to reconcile his description of the climate accord with the real one. \u201cAs of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the nonbinding Paris accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country,\u201d Trump said \u2014 a phrase seeming to contain a logical contradiction. If the agreement is nonbinding, then what burdens can it impose?",
        "Thirty states and scores of companies said Thursday that they would press ahead with their climate policies and pursue lower greenhouse gas emissions, breaking sharply with President Trump\u2019s decision to exit the historic Paris climate accord. In a pointed rebuttal to Trump\u2019s announcement in the rose garden of the White House, New York\u2019s governor Andrew M. Cuomo unveiled a plan to invest $1. 65 billion in renewable energy and energy efficiency on Thursday, the largest ever procurement of renewable energy by an American state.",
        "In ditching the Paris accord on climate change, President Trump has cemented his reputation as the international disrupter in chief with the latest in a string of decisions that foreign policy analysts believe could have profound consequences for U. S. global leadership. The decision to exit the Paris agreement is sure to anger many of the almost 200 nations that signed the commitment to reduce emissions. In one sign of shifting alliances, the European Union and China were expected to issue a joint statement Friday vowing to take a leading role in stemming climate change.",
        "I know for a fact that Donald Trump has been to Pittsburgh in the past 40 years. Look, here\u2019s a photo of him in the city from less than a year ago. According to the National Journal, Trump visited the city in April, June and September of last year. That photo above, from the Shale Insight conference, was taken during daylight hours on a sunny day.",
        "The Paris climate agreement was a step forward. President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the landmark agreement was several giant steps in the opposite direction. That\u2019s the underlying message of former president Barack Obama\u2019s statement on his successor\u2019s controversial move. Brief and to the point, Obama never mentions Trump by name. Instead, he pointedly refers to the \u201cabsence of American leadership,\u201d a jabbing phrase that for many Trump critics extends beyond the climate agreement.",
        "ST. PETERSBURG, Russia \u2014 The White House and a Russian bank have very different explanations for why the bank\u2019s chief executive and Jared Kushner held a secret meeting during the presidential transition in December. The bank maintained this week that the session was held as part of a new business strategy and was conducted with Kushner in his role as the head of his family\u2019s real estate business. The White House says the meeting was unrelated to business and was one of many diplomatic encounters the presidential adviser was holding ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.",
        "Of all the reasons Hillary Clinton thinks she lost the 2016 election to President Trump, the least among them was the state of the Democratic National Committee. That it was a mess long before she became a candidate was well known. That she did nothing about it sooner was her own mistake. But had she done so, it probably would have made no difference in the outcome.",
        "With his backward policies and his tiresome antics, President Trump seems to be trying his best to do something that ought to be impossible: make the U. S. presidency irrelevant to world progress. Climate change offers one example. Trump tried hard to build suspense for Thursday\u2019s announcement about whether he would honor or trash the landmark Paris accord; doubtless he\u2019d rather have attention focused on greenhouse gases than on the snowballing Russia investigations. At this point, however, I have to wonder what difference the decision to leave the agreement actually makes.",
        "So what if, in his speech last week to NATO, President Trump didn\u2019t explicitly reaffirm the provision that an attack on one is an attack on all? What\u2019s the big deal? Didn\u2019t he affirm a general commitment to NATO during his visit? Hadn\u2019t he earlier sent his vice president and secretaries of state and defense to pledge allegiance to Article 5? And anyway, who believes that the United States would really go to war with Russia \u2014 and risk nuclear annihilation \u2014 over Estonia? Ah, but that\u2019s precisely the point.",
        "MOSCOW When Russian officials and analysts here talk about the U. S. investigation of their alleged hacking of the 2016 campaign, two themes predominate: They\u2019re flattered that their country is seen as such a powerful threat, and they\u2019re amazed that the United States is so preoccupied with the scandal. This is the official line, to be sure, but it was also expressed by several critics of the regime I interviewed this week. People can\u2019t quite believe the sudden reversal of fortunes: Russia is back as a global force, after decades of humiliation.",
        "We now have a Trump Doctrine, and it is, at least in its conception and initial execution, the most radical departure from a bipartisan U. S. foreign policy since 1945. In an for the Wall Street Journal, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and national security adviser H. R. McMaster say that President Trump has \u201ca outlook that the world is not a \u2018global community\u2019 but an arena where nations, nongovernmental actors and businesses engage and compete for advantage. \u201d The senior officials add: \u201cRather than deny this elemental nature of international affairs, we embrace it.",
        "First they demanded participation trophies. Now, they\u2019re whining that the ref is totally unfair. Coddled millennial snowflakes? Nope. Members of the Trump administration. Perhaps the worst sports in America, White House officials refuse to accept that their plan is a huge, stinking, hopeless failure. Or in more Trumpian terms: a loser. A month ago, House Republicans \u2014 at the White House\u2019s urging \u2014 shoved a terrible bill through to a vote.",
        "THE WHITE HOUSE on Wednesday disclosed information on 14 waivers it has granted to exempt 17 appointees from government ethics standards. The release itself qualifies as good news. That it took so long is less good news: more evidence that this White House too often sees transparency as a nuisance to be resisted. Persistent pressure from the Office of Government Ethics, led by Walter M. Shaub Jr. resulted in the waivers\u2019 disclosure. Good for Mr. Shaub for sticking to his guns. In the event, there were no blockbuster revelations.",
        "President Trump\u2019s newest U. S. golf club \u2014 a course in New York that opened in 2015 \u2014 reported a 12 percent decrease in revenue over the past 12 months, as its banquet business sagged and golfers played fewer rounds. That drop in business at the Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point in the Bronx was revealed in documents that the Trump Organization filed with the city of New York. The city owns the course, built on an old garbage dump, but Trump\u2019s business has a contract to operate it and will pocket nearly all of its revenue.",
        "Sounding as despondent as a resident of death row, White House press secretary Sean Spicer slogged through the daily briefing on Wednesday, making little news except for news about the briefing itself. As news briefings go, it really was brief \u2014 less than 12 minutes from Spicer\u2019s opening statement to his abrupt departure. It was also oddly circumscribed by a White House edict banning TV cameras. Audio only, the White House decreed, turning an event regularly aired on live television into something out of the golden age of radio.",
        "True to the heroine at its core, \u201cWonder Woman\u201d arrives just in time to save the day on any number of fronts. After the talky and turgid \u201cBatman v. Superman\u201d and hopelessly muddled \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d a year ago, the DC Comics franchise has received an invigorating shot in the arm of handsome design and snappy storytelling. An indifferent box office promises to get a lift from a genuinely novel protagonist as enigmatic as she is compelling.",
        "A resort complex in Manila said it was on lockdown early Friday following reports of gunfire from unidentified attackers. Philippine police, fire trucks and SWAT teams rushed to the scene, where hotel employees reported seeing a masked gunman firing at guests on the second floor of a hotel. There were also reports of explosions at the complex. Resorts World Manila, in the southwestern part of metro Manila near Ninoy Aquino International Airport, said on Twitter that it was \u201ccurrently on lockdown following reports of gunfire from unidentified men.",
        "LeBron James was jarred, and he rarely looks this disturbed. He became King before puberty. Four years ago, when he won his second NBA title at age 28, he declared in celebration and appreciation, \u201cI\u2019m LeBron James from Akron, Ohio, from the inner city. I\u2019m not even supposed to be here. \u201d Those words were part of a raw and moving postgame speech about the persistence required to defeat inequity. As confetti rained down on him, he ended his remarks that night by saying, \u201cI ain\u2019t got no worries.",
        "It was the most consequential leak in the history of the offshore world, providing journalists and the public an unparalleled view into a notoriously shadowy industry that shuttles secret wealth around the globe. In 2007, an engineer extracted detailed records on the hidden wealth of more than 30, 000 clients of HSBC Private Bank, the Swiss subsidiary of the British multinational banking giant, and secreted them to the French government. The data, which eventually became known as the \u201cSwiss leaks,\u201d ended up in the hands of other authorities and of journalists.",
        "BENTONVILLE, ARK. \u2014 Walmart\u2019s newest tactic in its fight against online giant Amazon: enlisting its employees to deliver online orders on their way home from work. The idea, Walmart executives said Thursday, is to cut costs on the of deliveries, when packages are driven to customers\u2019 homes, often the most expensive part of the fulfillment process. \u201cIt just makes sense: We already have trucks moving orders from fulfillment centers to stores for pickup,\u201d Marc Lore, chief executive of Walmart\u2019s business and the founder of Jet. com, said in a blog post Thursday afternoon.",

In this installment, Spanish photographer Liste has made selections from American photographer Lowenstein\u2019s extensive body of work documenting the plight of people living on Chicago\u2019s South Side. Lowenstein isn\u2019t parachuting in for this work \u2014 he actually lives in the neighborhood and has dedicated his life to documenting it.

        "BRUSSELS  \u201d A day after President Trump pulled out of a key climate agreement",
        "PARIS \u2014 In a sense, he is already a star, the prince regent of Paris and Pittsburgh alike. Less than a month after his landslide victory in the French presidential elections, the boyish and photogenic Emmanuel Macron has become the anointed darling and principal spokesman of political moderates around the world, a fierce advocate of \u201cradical centrism,\u201d globalization and \u2014 following President Trump\u2019s watershed decision to remove the United States from the Paris accord \u2014 curbing climate change.",
        "President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement represents the clearest statement yet of convictions and principles that make up his worldview. \u201cAmerica First\u201d is more than a mere slogan to this president. It is the sum of beliefs \u2014 and grievances \u2014 about the way things are and ought to be. [Trump announces U. S.",
        "The House Intelligence Committee asked U. S. spy agencies late last year to reveal the names of U. S. individuals or organizations contained in classified intelligence on Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election, engaging in the same practice that President Trump has accused the Obama administration of abusing, current and former officials said. The chairman of the committee, Rep. Devin Nunes ( .) has since cast the practice of \u201cunmasking\u201d of U. S. individuals and organizations mentioned in classified reports as an abuse of surveillance powers by the outgoing Obama administration.",
        "The resurrected feeling of American possibility came not from pontificating TV pundits or a radio host in a studio miles away. Optimism arrived here because of what people were seeing: the unemployment lines getting shorter and their daily commutes getting longer. Tom Gorton, 41, drove through those increasingly congested streets in his Arnold Machinery truck late on a spring afternoon, under the watch of mountains covered in white from a spring snowstorm.",
        "The Office of Government Ethics plans to press the White House to clarify when it issued a slew of ethics waivers giving its staffers permission to interact with their former employers or clients, an indication that the exemptions might not have been properly granted. Ten of the 14 waivers publicly disclosed this week by the White House are undated and unsigned, raising questions about when they were put in place."
