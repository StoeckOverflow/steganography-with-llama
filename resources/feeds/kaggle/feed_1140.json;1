        "George Conway \u2014 a partner at a prominent law firm and the husband of White House adviser Kellyanne Conway \u2014 has withdrawn his name from consideration for a post leading the Justice Department\u2019s civil division. In a statement, George Conway said that, because of the timing, he could not take the job, though he was happy to have been considered. \u201cI am profoundly grateful to the President and to the Attorney General for selecting me to serve in the Department of Justice.",
        "Well, Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t going gently. That may be understandable, but it\u2019s not smart \u2014 not for Clinton, not for her party and not for other female candidates. Clinton has emerged in recent weeks, and this version is Hillary Unbound, no words minced, no target spared \u2014 except, for the most part, herself. So there was Clinton at a Recode conference, not merely relitigating the 2016 election but relitigating it like the relentless trial lawyer she once was.",
        "A curious thing happened on President Trump\u2019s way out of the Paris climate accord. American mayors, governors, corporate leaders and others immediately committed to meeting the agreement\u2019s terms anyway. All politics is local, they say, and personal responsibility begins at home. Hasn\u2019t this always been one of the operating principles of conservatism and ? It is but a hop and a skip from opposing the concentration of federal power to the perceived concentration of power in other nations that many Americans view as NOCD \u2014 not our class, dear.",
        "As changing technologies and preferences make broadcasting increasingly preposterous, such broadcasting actually becomes useful by illustrating two dismal facts. One is the immortality of entitlements that especially benefit those among society\u2019s articulate upper reaches who feel entitled. The other fact is how impervious government programs are to evidence incompatible with their premises. Fifty years and about 500 channels ago, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was created to nudge Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society \u2014 it aimed to make America great for the first time \u2014 the final inches toward perfection.",
        "Evan Thomas is the author of \u201cRobert Kennedy: His Life. \u201d Jared Kushner is not the first member of a presidential family to try to open a back channel with the Kremlin. John F. Kennedy\u2019s brother Robert met secretly with a Soviet intelligence agent named Georgi Bolshakov many times during the Kennedy administration. Their dealings illustrate the shortcomings and dangers of informal diplomacy \u2014 but also the potential for breakthrough in a crisis. The Kennedy brothers were, in their way, as highhanded as the Trump family.",
        "So what name does President Trump have in mind for Jeremy Joseph Christian? Trump has to be working on something, since is his weapon of choice when it comes to branding people. If nothing else, Christian, identified by authorities as the perpetrator of last week\u2019s horrifying, terrorist attack in Portland, Ore. warrants being called out for the wretched creature that he is. Trump had no problem doing just that when it came to the terrorists involved in the Manchester, England, attack that killed 22 people. \u201cI won\u2019t call them monsters because they would like that term,\u201d Trump said.",
        "ANYONE PAYING attention to the mushrooming investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 U. S. election campaign and President Trump\u2019s possible ties to Moscow will have noticed that this is not a simple story. At issue are complex questions of espionage, counterintelligence, unlawfulness, secrecy, sovereignty and coverup. It will be hard enough for the ongoing probes by the FBI, Congress and special counsel Robert S. Mueller III to sort out the mess and come up with the truth and reach credible conclusions. That is why the latest maneuverings of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes ( .) are disturbing.",
        "President Trump came into office promising an economic boom fueled by infrastructure spending, health care reform and tax cuts. But nearly five months later, the excitement over the president\u2019s plans has given way to unease, with recent data sounding a note of caution about just how long the economy\u2019s current expansion will run. On Friday morning, federal economists reported that U. S. job growth came in below expectations in May, with employers adding just 138, 000 jobs in the month, below average monthly gains of 180, 000 in the past year.",
        "Darryl Hill, hailed for integrating college football in his youth half a century ago, was a successful entrepreneur with no criminal record and plenty of capital when he applied for a license to grow marijuana in Maryland \u2014 a perfect candidate, or so he thought, to enter a industry that was supposed to take racial diversity into account. To his dismay, Hill was shut out on his first attempt. So were at least a dozen other African American applicants for Maryland licenses. They were not told why.",
        "A defiant, tearful Kathy Griffin said Friday that she regretted making a photo of herself holding a mask that looked like President Trump\u2019s bloody severed head, but she wasn\u2019t going to stop criticizing the president or fighting for others to do so. The comments were the comedian\u2019s first beyond a apology on social media. The image outraged Trump, his family and many, many others earlier this week. She said five employers had canceled scheduled shows since then, and she\u2019d been fired by CNN.",
        "(This story has been updated.) Three former Pennsylvania State University administrators, including former president Graham Spanier, were each sentenced to serve at least two months in jail Friday for failing to alert law enforcement about a 2001 incident involving retired football coach Jerry Sandusky and a boy in a campus shower. The sentences marked one of the final rulings from the criminal justice system on the shocking saga of missed opportunities to stop a sexual predator associated with one of America\u2019s most storied college football programs.",
        "It seems as though White House press secretary Sean Spicer is having trouble answering the media\u2019s questions these days. At Friday\u2019s briefing, Spicer used the phrase \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d four times in response to reporters\u2019 questions. Other times, he simply said he hasn\u2019t discussed the topic at hand, or couldn\u2019t answer the question. That\u2019s an astonishing lack of clarity from a man paid specifically to answer questions on behalf of the president. In the video above, you can see Spicer repeatedly say that he doesn\u2019t have the requisite knowledge to answer questions about Trump\u2019s policies.",
        "The conservative Heritage Foundation is pushing to allow 800, 000 military children to use federal tax dollars for private education, a proposal that comes as President Trump seeks to make good on his promise to dramatically expand school choice nationwide. Under the Heritage proposal, military children would be able to elect to leave their public schools and instead receive a lump sum \u2014 an \u201ceducation savings account\u201d \u2014 that they could put toward private school tuition, tutoring or online school. The proposal would require redirecting money from $1.",

As she shook hands with Modi, the Indian leader quipped, \u201cI saw your tweet with the umbrella!\u201d \u2014 a reference to Kelly\u2019s earlier observation that it had finally stopped raining. Kelly appeared taken aback. \u201cOh yes!\u201d she said.",
        "LONDON \u2014 British police declared at least two major incidents Saturday night after multiple people were reported to have been injured when a van veered into pedestrians on London Bridge. There were later reported stabbings in a nearby market. Witnesses reported that a white van was traveling fast \u2014 approximately 50 miles per hour \u2014 when it mounted the sidewalk and plowed into a group of people crossing the Thames River on foot.

        "President Trump will seek to put a spotlight on his vows to privatize the nation\u2019s air traffic control system and spur $1 trillion in new investment in roads, waterways and other infrastructure with a weeklong series of events starting Monday at the White House. The events \u2014 billed as \u201cinfrastructure week\u201d \u2014 are part of a effort since the president\u2019s return a week ago from his first foreign trip to show that the White House remains focused on its agenda, despite cascading headlines about investigations into his administration\u2019s ties to Russia.",
        "President Trump, who has famously called climate change a \u201choax,\u201d does believe the climate is changing and that humans have a role in it, U. N. Ambassador Nikki Haley told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. \u201dPresident Trump believes the climate is changing and he believes pollutants are part of the equation,\u201d Haley said in an interview on \u201cState of the Union,\u201d which will be fully aired Sunday.",
        "HBO host Bill Maher apologized for using a racial slur during his Friday show that led to a firestorm of criticism, including from the cable network. In a brief statement Saturday, Maher said he should not have used the derogatory term \u201cin the banter of a live moment. \u201d \u201cThe word was offensive and I regret saying it and am very sorry,\u201d he said.

        "What\u2019s the matter with Portland? In the past 10 days alone, the Oregon city has had a racist triple stabbing, a Republican Party chair threatening to hire militias for protection and . . . a culturally appropriative burrito cart. Yes, one of these things is not like the others. Most obviously, the last is a situation of cultural comedy: Portland. Burritos. . jargon. (No doubt a millennial eating avocado toast was somehow involved.) But it\u2019s also an excellent opportunity to examine what \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d is \u2014 and what harm is done when the term is overused.",
        "\u201cIT\u2019S GOING to so polarize the country and so galvanize the opposition that actually the climate action effort and coalition will get much stronger,\u201d California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) told NPR on Friday, the day after President Trump announced the United States\u2019 withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Mr. Brown and his counterparts in New York and Washington state got started quickly, trumpeting the creation of the United States Climate Alliance, a effort from three states that account for about 20 percent of the nation\u2019s population and gross domestic product. The federal government is irreplaceable in fighting climate change.",
        "LONDON We are days away from the British parliamentary elections on Thursday. I\u2019m not going to predict the result, but it\u2019s already clear that the British prime minister will not get the landslide she wanted. The same polls that showed a huge majority for Theresa May two months ago have narrowed. Some foresee, if not an outright Labor victory, then at least a hung Parliament. Even if she wins, her position is tarnished. Support that seemed solid has vanished. Why?",
        "On Jan. 20, the D. C. Metropolitan Police Department arrested more people than it had space to detain. As one of the 214 people arrested protesting Donald Trump\u2019s presidential inauguration, I was among them. Other protesters and I were surrounded without an order to disperse, sprayed with chemical irritants and boxed into the corner of L and 12th streets NW. At about 6:30 p. m. after spending eight hours on that corner, I was handcuffed and put into a police wagon. Six blocks away, a Trump supporter was arrested at his room at the Mayflower Hotel.",
        "More than a thousand people gathered near the Washington Monument Saturday to rally at the March for Truth, calling for an independent investigation into alleged collusion between Russia and President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. Organizers also used the occasion to celebrate the \u201cresistance\u201d movement against the Trump administration, and implored the crowd to stay involved for the long haul. \u201cWe gotta keep up the fight, that\u2019s all there is to it,\u201d said Jon Lovett, a former President Obama speechwriter and popular podcast host, who spoke at the D.

        "COEUR d\u2019ALENE, Idaho \u2014 Jakob Namson peered up at the towering ponderosa pine before him. He looked at his notebook, which was full of calculations scribbled in pencil. Then he looked back at the pine. If his math was right \u2014 and it nearly always is \u2014 then he would need to plant 36 trees just like this one to offset the 831 pounds of carbon dioxide that his drive to school emits each year. Namson, 17, gazed around at his classmates, who were all examining their own pines in northern Idaho\u2019s Farragut State Park.",
        "WISCONSIN DELLS, WISCONSIN \u2014 If one state can claim the title of putting President Trump in the White House, it would have to be Wisconsin. Trump won Wisconsin and two other states by less than a percentage point in November, but only Wisconsin broke a streak of voting for the Democratic presidential nominee. And if one state can prove Trump\u2019s surprise electoral win could happen again, it\u2019s Wisconsin. Here, the battle for the ideologically eclectic Trump voter is already on. In 2018, Wisconsin Republicans and Democrats will clash yet again for two massive statewide races, U. S.",
        "You might think that it would be a matter of course for the education secretary to provide direct answers to direct questions about education or education policy. As it turns out, that is often not the case with Betsy DeVos. The secretary\u2019s come in different forms. Sometimes, for example, she offers a response that deliberately doesn\u2019t answer the precise question, as she did on Friday, when she was asked about her views on climate change and whether human activity has affected it.",

        "The father of two, asleep next to his wife in their home, was awakened by a cellphone beep. It signaled a message from his Nest outdoor security system. \u201cNest has spotted a person,\u201d it read. He pushed a few buttons, rewinding the recorded video.
