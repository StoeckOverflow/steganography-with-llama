        "It doesn\u2019t matter how you are \u2014 when the temperature approaches triple digits, you want to beat the heat. But ceiling fans are a contentious topic. Blacklisted by designers for being noisy, tacky and outdated, they\u2019re often the first thing to go in a home renovation and a cause for debate in divided households in which one party wants circulation and one wants style. Don\u2019t sweat it. Ceiling fans are smarter, sleeker and quieter than ever. If you\u2019re in the market for one and starting from scratch, here are some handy guidelines to picking the best one.",
        "During a recent Zumba class at the Washington Sports Club in Dupont Circle, an emaciated woman came in a few minutes late and began to follow the class\u2019s movements. One class participant was alarmed enough to tell the front desk. \u201cI was very concerned she would break a bone or sustain a heart attack,\u201d said the woman, who did not wish to be identified.",
        "PARIS \u2014 Following the third deadly terrorist attack Britain has suffered in less than three months, Prime Minister Theresa May vowed Sunday to review her country\u2019s counterterrorism strategy. While May condemned what she called the \u201cevil ideology of Islamist extremism,\u201d the thrust of her new counterterrorism demands focused on a far more technical matter: the Internet. \u201cWe cannot allow this ideology the safe space it needs to breed,\u201d May said Sunday, speaking outside 10 Downing Street. \u201cYet that is precisely what the Internet \u2014 and the big companies that provide services \u2014 provide.",
        "A traditional president would have reacted carefully to the London Bridge terrorist attack by instilling calm, being judicious about facts and appealing to the country\u2019s better angels. But Donald Trump is no traditional president. He reacted impulsively to Saturday night\u2019s carnage by stoking panic and fear, being indiscreet with details of the event and capitalizing on it to advocate for one of his more polarizing policies and to advance a personal feud.",
        "The first reports of \u201can incident\u201d in London emerged Saturday evening. Within hours, cable news channels were saturated with the loop of panicked faces, desperate crowds scurrying for safety and scowling, heavily armed police. On Sunday morning, the New York Times said the latest terrorist attack in London had targeted a nation \u201cstill reeling\u201d from a suicide bombing in Manchester last month. On Sunday, some Londoners started pushing back against the notion that their city \u2014 if not their country \u2014 was trembling in fear. They had a simple message: \u201cLondon is not reeling.",
        "Stokes\u2019 favorite bridge in the whole of the British capital is London Bridge because of the spectacular views it offers. Stokes, 69, works as a tour guide on an bus. On Saturday night he was giving his spiel to about 50 tourists on London Bridge. \u201cI always tell everyone to get out their cameras, get ready to take picture of the Tower Bridge all lit up. It\u2019s the most beautiful part of our tour,\u201d he said Sunday. \u201cBut the bus was moving very slowly.",
        "MANCHESTER, England \u2014 The tens of thousands of young Brits who descended on this city\u2019s largest cricket ground weren\u2019t there just for a concert. They also wanted to send a message: We are not afraid. Two weeks ago, 22 people were killed and 116 were injured in a suicide bombing across town at the Manchester Arena, where pop music idol Ariana Grande had just wrapped up a show. Her adoring audience that night was made up mostly of young women and girls, as were most of the casualties.",
        "Donald Trump has in many ways made good on his promise to be a political wrecking ball. Last week, he withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord. He has worked to roll back dozens of health, environment, labor and financial rules put in place by former president Barack Obama, and he scrapped a trade deal with Asia as one of his first acts in office.",
        "The crowd rose to its feet and roared its approval as Sen. Jeff Sessions bounded onto the stage at the Breakers, an exclusive resort in Palm Beach, Fla. Stephen Miller, an aide to the Alabama Republican, handed him a glass trophy honoring his bravery as a lawmaker. \u201cHeyyyy!\u201d Sessions yelled out to the crowd. The ceremony that day, in November 2014, turned out to be a harbinger: It brought together an array of activists and a charity whose ideas would soon move from the fringes of the conservative movement into the heart of the nation\u2019s government.",
        "Gary Williams thought he had found a glimmer of hope. Six months earlier, his wife, Gwendolyn \u2014 64 and a retired education professor at Bowie State University in Maryland \u2014 had been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s. The disease, as Gary would come to describe it, was \u201ca train\u201d in their lives. He brought Gwendolyn to Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore, with his fingers crossed, looking for a study or clinical trial to help ease the nightmare they were living. He and his wife knew there wasn\u2019t a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s, but they wanted to contribute to finding one.",
        "The stoic determination and decency of the British people and their leaders were on full display in the hours after the latest horrific terrorist rampage. The Brits fought back, launching drinking glasses and chairs at the savages who attacked them. The police acted with precision, killing the three assailants within eight minutes of the emergency call. And, God Bless him, a man returned to the bar where he experienced Saturday\u2019s horror \u2014 to pay his bill and tip. Civilization is not going to be driven out of Britain by three or three hundred killers.",
        "LAST MONTH, on the very day the State Department cautioned Americans on the dangers of traveling to Haiti, the Trump administration warned more than 50, 000 Haitians living legally in the United States that they may be forced to return home en masse next January because conditions in their native country had improved so markedly. The timing of the two announcements was merely coincidental, but it was a telling coincidence. Even as the Trump administration presses ahead with a nativist agenda on multiple fronts, the costs in human hardship of such a policy are abundantly clear.",

        "Ever since taking office, President Trump has been condemning leaks, leakers and the journalists they leak to. \u201cI\u2019ve actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks,\u201d Trump said in February. \u201cThose are criminal leaks. \u201d Only days after he took office \u2014 as we know from a leak \u2014 Trump asked then James B. Comey to consider jailing journalists who publish government secrets. And just a few days ago, Trump again ranted about leakers who \u201cshould be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.",
        "PORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 The suspect charged with fatally stabbing two Portland men who tried to stop his tirade against two teenage girls built a life around hate speech and his right to use it. Jeremy Joseph Christian, who has spent much of his adulthood behind bars, littered social media with erratic and menacing posts about his hatred of just about everything and everyone. He made death threats against Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and ranted when Facebook deleted an update. \u201cThere is no feeling like being muzzled. Cut out your tongue,\u201d he wrote in one post.",

        "The federal workforce. Blech. Blech, now more than ever, or so it seems, in the minds of the new administration. \u201cA waste of your money,\u201d Trump\u2019s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, said in March about federal research. \u201cCan we really continue to ask a coal miner in West Virginia or a single mom in Detroit to pay for these programs?\u201d he had said about public broadcasting. \u201cTaxpayers are stuck paying for overly generous compensation,\u201d Rep.

        "Their advocacy results in big, embarrassing airline fines. They\u2019ve helped create federal agencies that make air travel safer. And they\u2019ve brought competition and transparency to the skies. They are the unsung heroes of the airline industry, fighting to make air travel better for the average passenger. And while the names of these consumer advocates may not be familiar to the average passenger, you might want to thank them the next time your flight goes smoothly. For example, if you\u2019ve wondered who\u2019s behind all those Transportation Department airline fines, you can thank Ben Edelman, at least in part.",
        "Reader: I\u2019m in my first management job. I have one direct report and am hiring another, and it\u2019s down to two good candidates. I have not checked references yet, but they\u2019ve been through multiple interviews, and their writing test results had pros and cons that balanced out. My direct report and I prefer Candidate A; we connected well and were impressed by her interview and strong qualifications. She would also bring diversity. However, my boss and another prefer Candidate B, an internal candidate who is well liked but less experienced.",
        "As a dietitian, I get asked all the time, \u201cWhere do you stand on diets?\u201d I take issue with blaming gluten for what ails us. I take issue with saying diets aren\u2019t helpful for anyone who doesn\u2019t have celiac disease. But most of all, I take issue with all the hype and misinformation out there.

It seems that going could increase your risk for coronary heart disease, clearly the opposite effect that health seekers are hoping for.",
        "President Trump will not attempt to stop former FBI director James B. Comey from testifying in a public hearing Thursday by asserting executive privilege, the White House said Monday. \u201cThe president\u2019s power to assert executive privilege is well established,\u201d principal deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters during the daily press briefing. \u201cHowever, in order to facilitate a swift and thorough examination of the facts sought by the Senate Intelligence Committee, President Trump will not assert executive privilege regarding James Comey\u2019s scheduled testimony.",
        "LONDON \u2014 British police on Monday named two of the three attackers who killed seven people during a rampage in central London last week, saying both had lived only miles away from the scene of the carnage and acknowledging that one had been on the radar of security services but had recently dropped off. The admission is likely to inflame a security debate already underway in Britain as the country counts down to an unpredictable election on Thursday.",
        "President Trump on Monday derided the revised travel ban as a \u201cwatered down\u201d version of the first and criticized his own Justice Department\u2019s handling of the case \u2014 potentially hurting the administration\u2019s defense of the ban as the legal battle over it reaches a critical new stage.

        "Most Americans oppose President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, with a majority saying the move will damage the United States\u2019 global leadership, according to a new Washington News poll. Opposition to Trump\u2019s decision outpaces support for it by a roughly margin, with 59 percent opposing the move and 28 percent in support. The reactions also break down sharply along partisan lines, though Republicans are not as united in support of the withdrawal as Democrats are in opposition to it.",
        "A government contractor has been charged with mishandling classified information after authorities say she gave a National Security Agency document to a news organization. Reality Leigh Winner was accused of gathering, transmitting or losing defense information \u2014 the first criminal charge filed in a leak investigation during the Trump administration. Winner was arrested Saturday and the case was revealed Monday, shortly after the website the Intercept posted a redacted version of a U. S. intelligence document describing Russian government efforts to use hacking techniques against employees of a company that provides technical support to states\u2019 voting agencies.",
        "Climate policy is the new culture war, driven by nearly theological passions. Or actually theological passions \u2014 with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi claiming that President Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord was a \u201cdishonor\u201d to God. While God certainly values his creation, he is probably less concerned with the details of implementing the Paris agreement. Both detractors and supporters share a similar temptation of exaggeration. Trump claims that a relatively modest, entirely voluntary agreement that essentially maintains the current momentum of reductions in carbon emissions would somehow destroy the U. S. economy. It wouldn\u2019t."
