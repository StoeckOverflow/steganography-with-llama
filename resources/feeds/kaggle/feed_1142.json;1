        "What\u2019s holding back the Republican agenda? It\u2019s not the toothless Democrats, despite what you may have heard from President Trump. Five months ago, when Trump moved into the White House, they lost their grip on their last lever of significant Washington power. Likewise, it\u2019s not Trump\u2019s infernal nocturnal tweets, unhelpful though they may be. Neither is it the distraction of nonstop news about Trump\u2019s aides\u2019 ties to Russia or the president\u2019s own possible attempts to obstruct justice. Nor is it leaky White House staffers, nor the operatives of the \u201cdeep state. \u201d So what\u2019s actually obstructing the Republican agenda?",
        "The president has gone rogue. Not of the way through his term, Donald Trump has each day become more isolated: from his own appointees and staff (whom he routinely contradicts and undermines); from world leaders (whom he regularly offends); from the courts (whose integrity he has repeatedly assaulted); from his current director of the National Security Agency and his past director of the FBI (who are both expected to give damaging testimony this week on the Russia scandal); and even from his most ardent supporters (whose enthusiasm has softened markedly in polls).",
        "The statements President Trump issued on Twitter in recent days lead to a chilling conclusion: The man is out of control. I know that is a radical thing to say about the elected leader of the United States, the most powerful individual in the world. And I know his unorthodox use of social media is thought by some, including the president himself, to be brilliant. But I don\u2019t see political genius in the invective coming from Trump these days. I see an angry man lashing out at enemies real and imagined \u2014 a man dangerously overwhelmed.",
        "The great jazz singer Billie Holiday recorded \u201cStrange Fruit\u201d on April 20, 1939. It is a song about lynchings, inspired by the 1930 murder of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith, who were photographed, like in the words of the song, \u201changing from the poplar trees. \u201d Holiday sang the song so often and it meant so much to her that she apparently came to believe she it. She didn\u2019t. Abel Meeropol wrote it. He was a Bronx high school teacher \u2014 white, Jewish and, not uncommon at the time, a communist.",
        "BRITAIN CONTINUES to respond with impressive fortitude and sobriety to a string of terrorist attacks claimed by the Islamic State. London bar customers who suddenly found themselves confronting armed attackers Saturday responded by hurling glasses and stools at them. Police ended the assault by shooting and killing the terrorists just eight minutes after the first emergency call. Though the country is only days away from a and surprisingly close parliamentary election, both Prime Minister Theresa May and her opponents responded with relatively substantive proposals and arguments rather than rhetorical incitement.",
        "NORRISTOWN, Pa. \u2014 A witness sobbed, burning through tissues while she testified that the famous man gave her a pill and touched her as her vision blurred. Attorneys stalked across the well of the courtroom, voices booming in scorn and disgust. The drama unspooling in a creaky old courtroom here in this Philadelphia suburb is a trial that once would have seemed unimaginable, a reckoning for a comic legend who not so long ago embodied an ideal of wholesome fatherhood. Bill Cosby\u2019s days as America\u2019s biggest television star are long behind him.",
        "As a sheriff s department spokesman in rural Louisiana, Clay Higgins s rare candor precipitated his downfall, but not before it catapulted him to online fame and, more recently, a seat in the U. S. House of Representatives. Like another Republican politician who rode a populist wave to Washington this year \u201d also with a penchant for making controversial statements off the cuff \u201d the newly elected congressman finds himself under fire for making controversial statements about Muslims. Not a single radicalized Islamic suspect should be granted any measure of quarter, ?",
        "America\u2019s love affair with backyard chickens is a tad too intimate, and it\u2019s making some of us sick. Just this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, eight separate salmonella outbreaks linked to contact with pet poultry have taken place in the United States, sickening more than 370 people in 47 states and hospitalizing 71. No one has died in 2017 \u2014 yet. In 2016, a record 895 people who consorted with fowl came down with the nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and fever that characterize this infection, and three of them did not survive.",
        "ORLANDO \u2014 John Robert Neumann Jr. was fired in April from his job at a factory here that manufactures awnings and accessories for recreational vehicles. He returned to the isolated industrial area on Monday morning, authorities said, armed with a semiautomatic handgun and a hunting knife. Neumann crept in through a rear door at Fiamma, authorities said, apparently looking for specific company employees. He at one point encountered a woman, pointed a gun at her and told her to get out of the building, and the woman told investigators that she was allowed to leave unharmed.",
        "SAN JOSE \u2014 Chief executive Tim Cook said that Apple had six big announcements Monday at its annual developers conference. Cook promised updates to each of Apple\u2019s operating systems \u2014 for the Apple TV, the Apple Watch, mobile devices and computers \u2014 plus some additional announcements that he promises will be \u201cmajor. \u201d Here\u2019s what we found out about each of them: 1) Apple\u2019s home hub is here. The HomePod is Apple\u2019s smart speaker \u2014 the answer to Google Home and Amazon\u2019s Echo line.",
        "DUBAI \u2014 Four Arab nations led a diplomatic break with Qatar on Monday, moving swiftly to isolate the small but influential country in a feud that stunned the Middle East and divided a coalition of monarchies that the United States had hoped to rally to fight the Islamic State and counter Iran. The countries \u2014 Gulf Cooperation Council members Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, along with Egypt \u2014 released coordinated statements accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist groups and saying that as a result they were cutting links to the country by land, sea and air.",
        "Media coverage of the 2016 election often emphasized Donald Trump\u2019s appeal to the working class. The Atlantic said that \u201cthe billionaire developer is building a foundation. \u201d The Associated Press wondered what \u201cTrump\u2019s success in attracting white, voters\u201d would mean for his general election strategy. On Nov. 9, the New York Times article about Trump\u2019s victory characterized it as \u201ca decisive demonstration of power by a largely overlooked coalition of mostly white and voters. \u201d There\u2019s just one problem: this account is wrong. Trump voters were not mostly people. During the primaries, Trump supporters were mostly affluent people.",
        "The Facebook messaging group was at one point titled \u201cHarvard memes for horny bourgeois teens. \u201d It began when about 100 members of Harvard College\u2019s incoming freshman class contacted each other through the university\u2019s official Class of 2021 Facebook group. They created a messaging group where students could share memes about popular culture \u2014 a growing trend on the Internet among students at elite colleges. But then, the exchanges took a dark turn, according to an article published in the Harvard Crimson on Sunday.",
        "The White House on Monday formally endorsed a plan to spin off more than 30, 000 federal workers into a private, nonprofit corporation, separating the nation\u2019s air traffic controllers and those who work on a $36 billion modernization program from the Federal Aviation Administration. The Trump administration proposal essentially is an endorsement of a plan that failed to gain sufficient traction in Congress last year. It is in keeping with the desire of the administration and congressional Republicans to streamline government and transfer some functions into private hands.",
        "The nation\u2019s top intelligence official told associates in March that President Trump asked him if he could intervene with Director James B. Comey to get the bureau to back off its focus on former national security adviser Michael Flynn in its Russia probe, according to officials. On March 22, less than a week after being confirmed by the Senate, Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats attended a briefing at the White House together with officials from several government agencies.",
        "When James B. Comey sits down before a microphone Thursday in his first public appearance since he was fired as director of the FBI, a key question he is likely to face is whether he believes President Trump tried to obstruct an ongoing federal probe of his associates. Even before Comey has uttered a word, some predict the hearing will be historic \u2014 a moment in which a former senior official has a nationally televised platform to repudiate a president who has lashed out at the federal government he leads.",
        "DUBAI \u2014 Middle East countries scrabbled on Tuesday to mediate the deep rift between Qatar and several other Arab nations that is threatening to splinter the U. S. regional alliance. Qatar\u2019s neighbors, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain were joined by Egypt on Monday cutting ties with Qatar and denouncing it for supporting terrorism in the region. The eruption of the long simmering dispute into an open rift shocked the region and has threatened the deeply intertwined regional trade links and air routes.",
        "PITTSBURGH \u2014 The mayor needed a break, and now he had a cold beer and a shot of whiskey on the table in front of him. His Penguins ball cap was pulled low. His dress shirt was untucked.",
        "SOMERSET COUNTY, PA. \u2014 Like many people here who have eked out a living underground, Edward Popernack, 84, is used to seeing outsiders paint the coal industry in sharp contrasts: Past or future. Liberal or conservative. Clean or dirty. Popernack, who started working in his father\u2019s coal mine when he was 13 years old, knows firsthand the value \u2014 and the hardships \u2014 of the job. Coal mining ruined his lungs and almost took the life of his son, who was trapped underground for days in an accident. But it also has sustained his family and community.",
        "It\u2019s been almost a month since President Trump fired James B. Comey on May 9, leaving the FBI without a director. Under normal circumstances, a president planning to fire the head of the nation\u2019s top agency might do so only once he had a successor lined up. (The only other time an FBI director was fired, President Bill Clinton announced his replacement the next day.) Trump didn\u2019t do that, pledging instead that a new director would be identified quickly.",
        "UNITED NATIONS \u2014 The Trump administration warned Tuesday that the United States could pull out of the U. N. Human Rights Council unless the body ends what Washington calls the whitewashing of dictators\u2019 abuses and unfair attacks on Israel. President Trump\u2019s U. N. ambassador, Nikki Haley, delivered the ultimatum in an unusual address in Geneva to the body. \u201cThe United States is looking very carefully at this council and our participation in it. We see some areas for significant strengthening,\u201d Haley told council members.",
        "President Trump, on his recent European trip, literally shoved aside Prime Minister Dusko Markovic of Montenegro in order to get to the front of a group of leaders. On Monday, Vice President Pence hosted the shoving victim at the White House, then praised Markovic publicly. \u201cI had the privilege of welcoming the prime minister to the White House today,\u201d Pence said at an Atlantic Council dinner. \u201cI was very humbled to be able to share a few moments with him on the very day that Montenegro became a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.",
        "\u201cIf only he would stop tweeting. \u201d Those words came from a friend of mine named \u201cJack,\u201d quite possibly President Trump\u2019s biggest fan. A former Secret Service agent, Jack is your typical Trump supporter. That is to say, he\u2019s a white, Christian male, married with two kids. He\u2019s honest, \u2014 a patriot, brave and loyal to the core. He and I are at political odds these days and argue frequently about Trump.",
        "MOSCOW At a cafe a few blocks from the old KGB headquarters at Lubyanka Square, investigative journalist Andrei Soldatov tries to explain the murky world of Russian intelligence that\u2019s now the focus of a U. S. criminal investigation into the hacking of the 2016 campaign. Big events in today\u2019s Russia often aren\u2019t the product of broad strategy, argues Soldatov, but rather are \u201ctactical moves\u201d that reflect the personal interests of Vladimir Putin and his \u201cpresidential administration. \u201d Soldatov thinks the Putin factor is crucial in understanding issues in the hacking investigation.",
        "Doug Sosnik, a Democratic political strategist, was a senior adviser to President Bill Clinton from 1994 to 2000. The nonstop coverage of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to manage multiplying investigations takes me back 20 years, to the time I served as senior adviser in the Clinton White House \u2014 an administration that was no stranger to political controversy. My lesson from those days: Trump and his advisers are in way over their heads and unprepared for what awaits them. Fired FBI director James B.",
        "Listening to Tuesday\u2019s first ever State Department briefing by new spokeswoman Heather Nauert, one might get the impression that the United States is conducting traditional, balanced and even somewhat nuanced foreign policy on the world stage. The problem is, of course, that President Trump\u2019s own statements on foreign policy destroy that image and there\u2019s no effort by either side to address the resulting contradictions. Nauert, a former Fox News host, waited five weeks before taking to the lectern to meet the State Department press corps, which is filled with seasoned diplomatic reporters steeped in the nuances of international issues.",
        "Uber has fired 20 employees in recent months as part of a investigation of the climate and culture at the popular service, the company said at a staff meeting Tuesday. The report of the firings came from an attorney at the Perkins Coie law firm, which Uber hired to assist in a broader sexual harassment investigation at the company and which made a presentation at the company\u2019s weekly staff meeting Tuesday.",
        "During the Memorial Day holiday weekend last month, Reality Winner, a living in Georgia, took a brief trip to Belize. Like so many people her age, she documented it on social media, posting about the little resort where she stayed, the banana pancakes she enjoyed and a moment of reflection she had while sitting in the Mayan pyramids. Winner described the trip as \u201csuch a spiritual journey for me,\u201d part of a young life that already had included serving as a language analyst in an Air Force intelligence squadron and a job in the field.",
        "The Senate cleared a path Tuesday evening for the Department of Veterans Affairs to take swift action to fire and discipline problem employees, overhauling job protections that Republicans would like to change across the federal workforce. Following a voice vote \u2014 and action in the House earlier this year \u2014 a bipartisan bill is expected to arrive quickly on the desk of President Trump, who pledged to bring accountability to VA, the federal agency.",
        "In one sentence Tuesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer just eliminated any doubt you may have about whether the media should pay attention to President Trump\u2019s tweets. \u201cThe president is the president of the United States, so they are considered official statements by the president of the United States,\u201d he said in response to a reporter\u2019s question. (Are you listening, Republican leaders in Congress? That includes you. More on that later \u2026 ) In other words: Duh, we should pay attention to Trump\u2019s tweets. He\u2019s the president."
