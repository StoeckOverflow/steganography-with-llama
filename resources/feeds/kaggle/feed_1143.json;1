        "Tyrannosaurus rex was an odd animal, a predator with teeth the size of bananas, a massive head and tiny arms. Given that many dinosaurs had feathers, could T. rex have been even weirder \u2014 a giant carnivore with a downy coat? A new study in the journal Biology Letters crushes any tyrant chicken dreams: T. rex was covered in scales. The new research \u201cshows without question that T. rex had scaly skin,\u201d study author Phil R. Bell, a paleontologist at Australia\u2019s University of New England, said in an email to The Washington Post. When T.",
        "An American who traveled undetected into Islamic Syria and fled three months later says he was \u201ccurious\u201d about life under the terrorist regime. The news media showed only their atrocities, he testified in Alexandria, Va. federal court this week, but their online supporters also touted the possibility of a peaceful life in the caliphate. He loved Syria when he visited with his family as a teenager, and was gripped by the current civil war. He wondered whether the ruling government was more violent than the Islamic State.",
        "NORRISTOWN, Pa. \u2014 Bill Cosby was more than just a television star to the family of Kelly Johnson, a woman who worked for the famed entertainer\u2019s personal appearances agent. He was a role model to the parents of Johnson, who would later accuse Cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting her. \u201cShe was very proud to introduce us to Mr. Cosby,\u201d Johnson\u2019s mother, Pattrice Sewell, testified Tuesday during day two of the comic legend\u2019s sex assault trial. Sewell and her husband were fans of \u201cThe Cosby Show,\u201d which focused on the life of an African American family.",
        "On this day 73 years ago, the Allied Expeditionary Forces, under the overall command of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, descended on the shores of Normandy, France, and helped pave the way for the end of World War II. About 156, 000 soldiers, at least 4, 000 ships and 11, 000 airplanes invaded Western Europe in a massive and coordinated attack called Operation Overlord. Now commonly known as it turned the tide against Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany.",
        "OTTAWA \u2014 Canada intends to make \u201ca substantial investment\u201d in its military because it can no longer rely on the United States for global leadership in the face of threats posed by terrorist groups or countries like Russia and North Korea, the Canadian foreign minister said Tuesday. Echoing complaints made recently by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Chrystia Freeland told Canada\u2019s House of Commons that Washington has decided to forfeit its position of leadership on many issues, forcing Canada to invest in its own armed forces to defend liberal democracy.",
        "Fired FBI Director James B. Comey said President Trump told him at the White House \u201cI need loyalty, I expect loyalty\u2019\u2019 in their private White House dinner conversation in January, according to written testimony prepared by Comey. In written remarks submitted to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday \u2014 a day before his testimony \u2014 Comey said he remembered nine separate private conversations with President Trump. Three were in person and six on the phone. Comey said the president called him at lunchtime on Jan. 27 to invite him to dinner.",
        "On Thursday, FBI director James B. Comey is going to testify in front of the Senate committee investigating Russia meddling, specifically about what he says President Trump asked him to do with regard to the investigation. The Senate Intelligence Committee just released Comey\u2019s prepared testimony, and it is remarkable. The Fix has annotated some key parts.

        "Two of the nation\u2019s top intelligence officials declined in a testy hearing Wednesday to discuss the specifics of private conversations with President Trump, refusing to say whether they had been asked to push back against an FBI probe into possible coordination between Trump\u2019s campaign and the Russian government. Testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats demurred when asked whether it was true, as The Washington Post reported Tuesday, that Trump asked Coats if he could intervene with Director James B.",
        "To President Trump, the Russia matter is not a legitimate federal investigation into a foreign government\u2019s interference with American democracy. That, he says, is a \u201ccharade\u201d manufactured by Democrats to account for their loss in the 2016 election. Nor does Trump seem to regard Russia as an issue that could result in his impeachment, or even one that could expose him to legal trouble of any kind. Over and over, the president has insisted that he has had \u201cnothing to do with Russia.",
        "Donald Trump is president of the United States, duly elected last November and sworn into office in January. But he appears oddly and remarkably disconnected from the executive branch over which he exercises power. There is the president, and then there is the rest of the government. A table of organization of Trump\u2019s executive branch would, as always, start with a box at the top representing the president. Beneath it would be a series of boxes \u2014 White House staffers, Cabinet officers, subcabinet officials and the like.",
        "The clarion of the far right seems to be having second thoughts with how far right it wants to go. Faced with an advertiser boycott and plummeting readership, Breitbart News has lately been trimming back some of its more extreme elements in what may be a bid for more mainstream respectability. Gone: Prominently displayed stories appealing to overt racial prejudice, such as reports and essays about crimes committed by African Americans. Articles such as \u201cFive Devastating Facts about Crime\u201d and \u201c Crime: Blame it on the System and Ignore the Evidence\u201d have all but disappeared from the site.",
        "Dan Coats is taking the \u201cintelligence\u201d out of \u201cnational intelligence director. \u201d Testifying with Trump administration colleagues Wednesday to the Senate Intelligence Committee, Coats read aloud from his written testimony about \u201cherculean\u201d efforts made by the National Security Agency. \u201cThe NSA has made \u2014 this is hard for me to say,\u201d said President Trump\u2019s national intelligence director, a former Republican senator from Indiana. \u201cThey have made extensive efforts. I think, is the, uh \u2014 \u201d Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a fellow witness, intervened. \u201c \u201d he coached. \u201cSay that again?\u201d Coats requested.",
        "Succeeding in politics in a democratic nation is different from making a go of it in a business centered on one person \u2014 or in an autocracy. Almost all of President Trump\u2019s problems can be traced to his failure to grasp this. It explains why he now has such a big problem with former FBI director James B. Comey. It\u2019s not surprising that Trump\u2019s warmest words have been reserved for autocrats. They run things the way he likes to run things. No obnoxious media. No annoying political opposition. No independent judiciary.",
        "Over the past decade and a half, tolerance for polygamy has more than doubled among the American public. A similar trend applies to human cloning. Stunning as they are, these findings from the latest Gallup survey of moral opinion in the United States may tell more about the political future than the daily drama surrounding President Trump. To be sure, the percentage declaring polygamy and human cloning \u201cmorally acceptable,\u201d in Gallup\u2019s phrase, remains small: Seventeen percent are okay with the former; 14 percent, the latter. Neither is likely to become legal soon.",
        "TOKYO \u2014 North Korea fired another salvo of missiles Thursday morning, keeping up the relentless pace of testing as it advances toward its goal of producing an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the mainland United States. The latest barrage comes after three launches in May, and means Kim Jong Un has now ordered almost as many missile launches this year alone as his father oversaw \u2014 16 \u2014 during 17 years in power.",
        "Republicans in Kansas broke ranks with the state\u2019s conservative governor Tuesday night, voting to raise tax rates and put an end to a series of cuts. The GOP revolt is a defeat for Gov. Sam Brownback, who overhauled the state\u2019s tax system beginning in 2012, part of what called a \u201d experiment\u201d in conservative governance. Yet the economic boom Brownback promised has not materialized, leaving the state government perennially short on money and forced to reduce basic services.",
        "If President Trump\u2019s \u201cinfrastructure week\u201d was winning converts, Rep. Rick Nolan ( .) was exactly the sort of Democrat who should have come over. Elected in 2012, he watched his district in northeast Minnesota swing hard right, giving Trump a victory. If he ran for reelection, he\u2019d be at the top of Republican target lists, with attack ads informing voters how a member of the Transportation Committee had failed to deliver. Nolan thought the Trump pitch had been a bust. \u201cI thought a trillion dollars for infrastructure meant a trillion dollars for infrastructure,\u201d Nolan said.",
        "The House voted 282 to 137 Wednesday in favor of a bill that would allow U. S. Customs and Border Protection to waive a mandatory test for applicants from law enforcement or the military, raising alarms that the move will weaken standards at the agency. Supporters argued that the bill would relieve chronic staffing shortages at CBP, which guards the nation\u2019s ports and borders, and it follows calls from President Trump to beef up border security. But immigrant advocates expressed fear that the measure will lead to corruption and abuse. Rep.",
        "The Islamic State has struck at Iran and its allies for years \u2014 but always from afar, in places such as Iraq against militias and in Syria battling government troops aided by Iranian forces. That appeared to change Wednesday when bloodshed came to Tehran. In a few chaotic hours, Iran endured the kind of deadly rampages so often claimed by the Islamic State elsewhere.",
        "President Trump\u2019s adult sons think it is time for everyone to take the high road in political discourse. Just don\u2019t expect them to lead the way. \u201cMorals have flown out the window,\u201d Eric Trump lamented on Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News show Tuesday night. \u201cWe deserve so much better than this as a country, and, you know, it\u2019s so sad. \u201d In the same interview, Eric Trump said this of his father\u2019s critics: \u201cTo me, they\u2019re not even people. \u201d In an interview that aired earlier Tuesday on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d Donald Trump Jr.",

These bones are from \u201cearly anatomically modern\u201d humans \u2014 our own species, Homo sapiens, with a mixture of modern and primitive traits, an international team of anthropologists, paleontologists and evolutionary scientists report in a pair of papers published Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
        "Former FBI director James B. Comey on Thursday used a dramatic appearance before a national audience to sharply criticize the character of the president, accusing Trump of firing him over the Russia investigation and then misleading the public about the reasons for the dismissal. Trump and his team, Comey said, told \u201clies, plain and simple,\u201d about him and the FBI in an effort to cover up the real reason for his sudden sacking last month.",
        "President Trump is clearly worried that former FBI director James B. Comey is going to come after him, through the media. That\u2019s what Friday\u2019s tweet about \u201ctapes\u201d was all about. James Comey better hope that there are no \u201dtapes\u201d of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017 Four days later, a person described by the New York Times as \u201cone of Mr. Comey\u2019s associates\u201d leaked a portion of Comey\u2019s notes from a February meeting with the president.",
        "During his Senate testimony Thursday, former FBI director James B. Comey admitted to being an anonymous leaker \u2014 a phrase that now has negative connotations. President Trump\u2019s lawyer even hinted that Comey may deserve prosecution. Let\u2019s set the record straight. The vast majority of anonymous leaks are fully legal, many serve the public interest, they follow in a tradition widely practiced by our nation\u2019s Founding Fathers, and they are recognized as fully protected speech by the U. S. Supreme Court.",
        "A Senate committee on Thursday heard former FBI director James B. Comey essentially lay out an obstruction of justice case against President Trump as he highlighted critical encounters that will be part of any evaluation of whether Trump committed a crime. There was evidence of possible intent: when the president cleared the room so he could ask Comey \u2014 without the attorney general or his present \u2014 about the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s contacts with Russian officials after the 2016 election.",
        "Fired FBI director James B. Comey\u2019s testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee about his conversations with President Trump on Russia can be summed up in one word: Newsworthy. Here are seven major takeaways from his testimony. 1) Comey is pretty sure Trump inappropriately interfered in the investigation \u2014 but Trump didn\u2019t ask the FBI to drop it entirely When asked if any official from the Trump administration had asked him to stop the FBI investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Former FBI director James B.",
        "It has been many years since a witness appeared on Capitol Hill and put a president in such potential jeopardy as former FBI director James B. Comey did Thursday. For the first time in the long investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election and questions about possible collusion by associates of President Trump\u2019s campaign, the focus has moved inside the White House and, specifically, to questions about the president\u2019s conduct in office.",
        "As former FBI director James B. Comey held the political world in thrall Thursday from inside a packed Senate hearing room, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan walked into an unusually empty press briefing across the Capitol. Before Comey s testimony about his private interactions with President Trump had even concluded, Ryan joined an effort already underway among GOP lawmakers to place it in the best possible light for Trump.",
        "In early January, before Donald Trump was sworn in as president, Sen. Marco Rubio took a brief turn as the Republican critic of Trump\u2019s emerging foreign policy. Rubio ( .) opened his questioning at the Jan. 11 confirmation hearing for Rex Tillerson, Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of state, with blistering questions about whether the ExxonMobil CEO believed that Russians, at the behest of President Vladi mir Putin, had interfered with the 2016 presidential election. Five months later, Trump\u2019s onetime GOP campaign rival displayed a far different demeanor. In Thursday\u2019s Senate Intelligence Committee hearing with James B.",
        "Following the testimony of former FBI director James Comey before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday, President Trump\u2019s personal attorney Marc Kasowitz released a statement in response. It is below in its entirety, slightly edited for typos. Sections not in bold represent context we\u2019ve added to Kasowitz\u2019s comments. I am Marc Kasowitz, President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer. Contrary to numerous false press accounts leading up to today\u2019s hearing, Mr. Comey has now finally confirmed publicly what he repeatedly told the President privately: The President was not under investigation as part of any probe into Russian interference."
