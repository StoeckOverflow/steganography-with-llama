        "This post has been updated with Sen. McCain\u2019s statement. Sen. John McCain ( .) was the last senator to question former FBI director James B. Comey at Thursday\u2019s Senate Intelligence Committee hearing. Nearing the end of more than 2\u00bd hours of questioning, McCain focused his line on two FBI inquiries: the 2016 investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server as secretary of state and the 2017 investigation of Russian interference in the presidential election. But several of his questions confused viewers, and seemingly Comey himself, and he occasionally was incoherent.",
        "Sen. Marco Rubio ( .) was having an unusual day on the Trump Internet, in that most of the president\u2019s most ardent supporters didn\u2019t seem to hate his guts. Rubio, insultingly nicknamed \u201cLittle Marco\u201d during the 2016 presidential campaign by Donald Trump, was questioning former FBI director James B. Comey during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Thursday morning.",
        "This was serious business, former FBI director James Comey testifying before Congress. But it was also a grand opportunity for the kind of televised stagecraft that the Washington establishment secretly adores. Boy oh boy, did the folks on Capitol Hill look and polished for the session with Comey, carried live on every major network. The public servants and the people who report or pontificate on them were like students dressed up for the first day of school. Their ensembles might not have been new, but they had an gleam.",
        "LONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s suddenly unpredictable election campaign moved to the ballot box Thursday as voting began in a race that Prime Minister Theresa May once had solidly in her grip but then reshaped by terrorists attacks in London and Manchester. May called the snap election seeking to increase her political power ahead of Britain\u2019s exit negotiations with the European Union, pitching herself as the best leader to enter into complex divorce talks. But the contest shifted in ways no one could have predicted.",
        "What do you do if you\u2019ve just been fired as director of the FBI, the administration has chosen to \u201cdefame\u201d you with \u201clies plain and simple,\u201d and you believe the president of the United States may be trying to obstruct justice? You leak bombshell information to the media in hopes of forcing the appointment of a special counsel. It might work. Actually, it did work. In stunning public testimony Thursday, James B. Comey acknowledged arranging for a friend to leak details of a conversation Comey had with President Trump \u2014 the Feb.",

We teach them to love and to live life to the fullest. We teach them countless things to help them become better people, because as parents we all want the best for our children.",
        "Having coined Bush Derangement Syndrome more than a decade ago, I feel authorized to weigh in on its most recent offshoot. What distinguishes Trump Derangement Syndrome is not just general hysteria about the subject, but additionally the inability to distinguish between legitimate policy differences on the one hand and signs of psychic pathology on the other. Take President Trump\u2019s decision. The hyperbole that met his withdrawal from the Paris agreement \u2014 a traitorous act of war against the American people, America just resigned as leader of the free world, etc. \u2014 was astonishing, though hardly unusual, this being Trump.",
        "David Gordon was director of policy planning at the State Department and is a senior adviser to the Eurasia Group. Michael O\u2019Hanlon is a senior fellow and director of research for the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution. President Trump\u2019s foreign policy has been taking a shellacking lately. With his insensitive tweets after the terrible June 3 attacks in London, ongoing allegations of improper ties between his presidential campaign and the Russians, and intelligence disclosures, the new president\u2019s second 100 days in office are not going any easier than the first 100.",
        "PARIS The newly elected French president is attempting a feat that the newly elected American president wouldn\u2019t dare: leadership. Emmanuel Macron, the youngest French head of state since Napoleon, has stolen many American hearts thanks to his moving defense of the Paris climate accord, gutsy news conference with Vladimir Putin and, of course, the fact that he married a much older woman. But here in France, his primary public contribution is expected to be on a different front: the economy. For decades, France has struggled with stagnant labor markets and intractably high unemployment. The jobless rate stands at 9.",
        "FORMER FBI director James B. Comey, testifying under oath Thursday to the Senate Intelligence Committee, painted a picture of a president grossly abusing his executive authority. According to Mr. Comey, President Trump pressured him to declare his loyalty, pressured him to drop an investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and then fired him in an effort to alter the course of the FBI\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion by the Trump campaign. However Mr. Trump and his allies may spin the testimony, these are serious and disturbing allegations.",
        "The House on Thursday voted to free Wall Street from many of the strict constraints put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, the opening salvo in what is likely to be a protracted battle over deregulation of the powerful banking industry. Big banks, from Goldman Sachs to Bank of America, would face less scrutiny and other large financial institutions, such as insurance giant MetLife, could escape tougher rules all together under the legislation approved along party lines. The Trump administration backed the bill as part of a effort to ease banking regulations in order to spur economic growth.",
        "The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday asked a drug company to remove its opioid pain medication from the market, the first time the agency has made such a request because of the public health consequences of abuse. The agency concluded after an extensive review of Endo Pharmaceuticals\u2019 Opana ER that the \u201cbenefits of the drug may no longer outweigh its risks. \u201d The company reformulated the drug in 2012 to make it more difficult to snort, but the FDA said that move actually led to more injections \u2014 and a major HIV outbreak.",
        "Rep. Trey Gowdy ( . C.) is set to take over as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, a post that carries broad authority to investigate President Trump and the executive branch. The House Republican Steering Committee voted Thursday to hand the gavel to Gowdy, according to statements issued by Gowdy and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( . ). Gowdy led the controversial investigation into the 2012 terrorist attacks on a U. S. diplomatic outpost and nearby CIA site in Benghazi, Libya.",
        "\u201cYou said you wanted this bad, I knew you weren\u2019t gonna try hard,\u201d she wrote in one text. \u201cYou have to do something quick that will end it without having to worry about the pain,\u201d she wrote in another. \u201cHang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself idk there\u2019s a lot of ways,\u201d read yet another message. The chilling texts \u2014 sent by Michelle Carter to Conrad Roy III in July 2014 \u2014 became some of the final words those inside the courtroom would hear as prosecutors in Massachusetts put the finishing touches on their manslaughter case against Carter.",
        "A new deal between the U. S. and Mexico on sugar exports may have averted a costly trade war. But it\u2019s also sparked a fierce battle between the Trump administration and some of America\u2019s largest food companies, who claim Tuesday\u2019s agreement will harm their businesses and ratchet up food costs for consumers. Under the preliminary agreement, Mexico will accept a new minimum price for the sugar it sells to the U. S. and restrict the amount of refined sugar it exports, measures that will maintain high sugar prices for domestic producers.",
        "There is nowhere in this country where someone working a minimum wage job could afford to rent a apartment, according to an annual report released Thursday documenting the gap between wages and the cost of rental housing. Downsizing to a will only get you so far on minimum wage. Such housing is affordable in only 12 counties located in Arizona, Oregon and Washington states, according to the report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition. You would have to earn $17.",
        "It started as a country in 1998. Mustafa Akbar and his mother, Mary Frances Holmes, decided to buy some food, hire a DJ and throw a party on the family property in Lignum, Va. The land had been in the family since the early 1900s, and Mustafa has about nine acres of it. The party was dubbed Mustock in 2000 when the first bands came to play. Two years later, Mustafa brought his own band to play a set or two, and the party got a little bigger and a little better. In subsequent years he built a stage.",
        "President Trump lambasted former FBI director James B. Comey on Friday as a \u201cleaker\u201d for engineering the release of details of their conversations to a news reporter. The unflattering moniker might fit: Comey has conceded to Congress that he told a friend to give a reporter information about his recollection of the president\u2019s request that he shut down the bureau\u2019s probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. But that does not make Comey a criminal, legal analysts said.",
        "President Trump on Friday accused former FBI director James B. Comey of lying under oath to Congress in the Russia investigation and called him a \u201cleaker,\u201d before suggesting he would be willing to give his side of the story to special counsel Robert Mueller. \u201cOne hundred percent,\u201d Trump said when asked by a reporter during a Rose Garden news conference if he would be open to talking to Mueller as part of the FBI probe he is overseeing. \u201cI\u2019d be glad to tell him exactly what I just told you,\u201d Trump added.",
        "Congressional investigators demanded Friday that the president turn over within two weeks any recordings he made of his conversations with former FBI director James B. Comey, as President Trump refused to answer questions about whether such recordings exist. The House Intelligence Committee\u2019s letter comes just one day after Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee about notes and memos he kept to document interactions with the president that made him uncomfortable \u2014 memos he slipped to the press, using a friend as intermediary, after Trump suggested via Twitter that he might have taped their discussions.",
        "The president is tweeting, and perhaps tweeting himself into more trouble, about James B. Comey, the FBI director he fired in May. In his second tweet before lunchtime Friday, President Trump potentially undermined his private lawyer\u2019s statements denying key parts of Comey\u2019s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee the day before. Here\u2019s the tweet: (Image from President Trump\u2019s Twitter account) And here\u2019s what Trump\u2019s private lawyer for all things Russia, Marc Kasowitz, said less than 24 hours ago: A bullet point break down of Trump\u2019s attorney, Marc Kasowitz\u2019s, response to Comey\u2019s testimony: pic. twitter.",
        "President Trump may have just lost the best friend he had in Europe. British Prime Minister Theresa May emerged from national elections damaged and without the mandate she sought. Her efforts to align with Trump may have hurt her, and she now has less leeway to cooperate with a leader a majority of Britons recently labeled a threat to international security. She also has less leverage. May\u2019s Conservatives lost their majority in Parliament in the election Thursday, and she must now govern in a coalition \u2014 if she keeps her job at all.",
        "LONDON \u2014 On the day after British voters delivered an astonishing repudiation of Prime Minister Theresa May at the very moment that she had expected to be her crowning glory, she tried to go on as though nothing much had changed. She would stay on as prime minister. She would keep her cabinet\u2019s elite circle. Her plans for Brexit would go forward. \u201cThat\u2019s what people voted for last June,\u201d she announced defiantly outside 10 Downing Street after meeting with Queen Elizabeth II to discuss her new government. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ll deliver. Now let\u2019s get to work.",
        "Under a nearly full moon, a small boat pulled away from the Libyan coastline. A bearded man sat on board, masked, handcuffed and gagged until out of shouting range of land. After 20 minutes, armed guards lowered him into a shallow pit in the deck of a second vessel to guard against his falling overboard on the final choppy, sprint to their destination: a U. S. warship waiting in the Mediterranean Sea. There, Ahmed Abu Khattala began a trip crossing the Atlantic Ocean that would end in an American courtroom.",
        "DOHA, Qatar \u2014 Four Arab nations on Friday placed dozens of people and groups with suspected links to Qatar on a terrorism blacklist, deepening a diplomatic dispute between key U. S. allies that threatens to destabilize the Middle East. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt designated 59 individuals and 12 charities as terrorists in a joint statement published by the Saudi news agency early Friday morning. The list included the spiritual leader of the Sunni Islamist group, the Muslim Brotherhood, as well as several charities.",
        "Thursday\u2019s Senate Intelligence Committee hearing was riveting in its own right. But at times, James B. Comey\u2019s grilling on the stand recalled nothing so much as a sexual misconduct trial, with the former FBI director playing the role of barely believed plaintiff. The proceedings brought to mind the patronizing, painful that victims have been conditioned to expect should they dare lodge a complaint about harassment or assault. From the exhaustive rehashing of every encounter between the president and the former FBI director to the performative disbelief of many of the questioning senators, the uncomfortable parallels were hard to ignore.",
        "Chalk up another loss for conventional wisdom. As Thursday dawned in Great Britain, it was expected that Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s Conservative Party would expand its majority in Parliament over the Labour Party and its \u201c \u201d leader Jeremy Corbyn. Friday dawned upon a different reality: The Conservatives have 318 seats \u2014 a loss of 13 seats from the previous election and eight short of the 326 needed an official majority.",
        "In 1947, President Harry Truman instituted a loyalty program for federal government employees, seeking to weed out those who had \u201ctotalitarian, fascist, communist or subversive\u201d sympathies. In 2017, President Trump instituted a loyalty program of his own, telling James B. Comey \u201cI need loyalty, I expect loyalty,\u201d according to the former FBI director. Truman sought loyalty to the United States. Trump wanted loyalty to himself. Instead, on Thursday, Trump got several hours of payback. What continues to amaze me about Trump is how little he knows \u2014 not just about history or government but also about basic human relations.",
        "Before the angry mob of breathless Democrats gets too spun up and ahead of itself, the should calm down and try to absorb just how preposterous it is to suggest that President Trump may have committed a criminal offense by supposedly obstructing justice during the Flynn investigation. Consider for a moment what would have happened if Trump had placed an in a prominent newspaper, arguing that the investigation into his campaign and former national security adviser Flynn was misguided, a wasteful use of government resources, and that he thought it should stop.",
        "As Senate Republicans move toward a vote on their own bill, they face an urgent political task. They must prove the bill is much less cruel than the version that passed the House last month, to keep on board more moderate GOP senators who don\u2019t want to be seen voting for a bill that kicks millions of poor people off Medicaid and guts protections for people with preexisting ailments. Senate Republicans appear to be preparing to do this in several ways. One is to say they\u2019ll phase out the Medicaid expansion more slowly over time."
