        "News of the noose found in one of the galleries of the National Museum of African American History and Culture was a gut punch. For many African Americans, the act of hate itself, and specifically where it was done, was deeply personal. It was akin to finding out something bad happened to a dear friend or a favorite relative. But for a white friend of mine, the racist affront at the museum was personal for him, too. [Even if you re white, ?",
        "OVERLAND PARK, Kan. \u2014 Kansas was at the heart of the tea party revolution, a red state where, six years ago, a deeply conservative group of Republicans took the state for a hard right turn. Now, after their policies failed to produce the results GOP politicians promised, the state has become host to another revolution: a resurgence of moderate Republicans. Moderate Republicans joined with Democrats this week to raise state taxes, overriding GOP Gov. Sam Brownback\u2019s veto and repudiating the conservative governor\u2019s platform of ongoing tax cuts.",
        "New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is \u201clooking into\u201d a charitable foundation founded by Eric Trump, a spokesman for Schneiderman said, after Forbes magazine raised questions about whether President Trump\u2019s son had made misleading statements about how the foundation spent its money. The New York attorney general has jurisdiction over charities in the state, where Eric Trump\u2019s foundation is registered. Schneiderman\u2019s office would say little about this new inquiry, other than to report that it was at an early stage and could not be considered a formal investigation.",
        "A man who was caught on video unleashing a racist tirade and then turning violent outside a Chicago Starbucks has been arrested and charged with battery, police say. According to police, William Boucher \u201cbecame irate\u201d after someone spilled a drink on him inside the Starbucks on Tuesday afternoon. A local television photographer who was in the store at the time captured the incident on his cellphone camera. In the video, a man later identified as Boucher can be heard shouting, \u201cYou\u2019re disgusting!\u201d and other insults in the presence of other customers and employees.",
        "A federal grand jury on Friday indicted a Kansas man on two hate crime charges in connection with a shooting in February that killed one Indian man and injured another. The attack, in Olathe, Kan. prompted immediate fears that it was motivated by bias after witnesses said the gunman told the two Indian men to \u201cget out of my country\u201d and uttered racial slurs. Police quickly filed murder charges against Adam W. Purinton, 51, and identified him as the suspected shooter. The FBI then said it was investigating the shooting as a possible hate crime.",
        "Brandon Wolf was having a hard night. Just after deciding with his love interest, Eric Borrero, that they wouldn\u2019t be in a relationship, Eric wanted to go out that weekend as friends. That Saturday, despite dragging along his close friends, Juan Guerrero and Christopher \u201cDrew\u201d Leinonen, as a buffer, the air between them at the club was tense and frustrating. But Leinonen took on the role of peacemaker. \u201cOne thing we don\u2019t do enough is remind each other how much we love each other,\u201d he said.",
        "To Democrats and many legal experts in both parties, the Senate testimony from fired FBI director James B. Comey is devastating to President Trump \u2014 portraying him as a liar who sought to halt the federal investigation into a former top aide and putting him in dire legal peril. But to Trump, many Republicans and a broad constellation of surrogates and conservative media outlets, the takeaway is much different: exoneration. \u201cDespite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication,\u201d the president tweeted early on the morning after Comey\u2019s testimony.",
        "British voters have now delivered two electoral shocks in 12 months. A year ago, they stuck a finger in the eye of the political establishment by voting to leave the European Union in the Brexit referendum. On Thursday, they shocked Prime Minister Theresa May by delivering a hung Parliament when she was hoping to emerge with a huge Conservative majority.",
        "Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had agreed to testify this week before the Senate and House appropriations committees about the Justice Department budget, wrote the chairmen of the committees Saturday and said he was sending his deputy to testify instead. Sessions was scheduled to testify before Congress on Tuesday for the first time since he was confirmed as attorney general in February. In light of former FBI director James B. Comey\u2019s testimony last week, Sessions was expected to get many questions from lawmakers about his contacts with Russian officials during the 2016 election campaign.",
        "Maybe this is why Sen. John McCain ( .) seemed a bit groggy during Thursday\u2019s congressional hearing: He had spent the previous week on the other side of the world, his away around the Pacific trying to reassure allies that the U. S. government remains in their corner. It\u2019s a role McCain has long played, but it\u2019s taken on a more serious tenor in the era of President Trump. Already this year, the senator has logged more than 75, 000 miles to more than 15 nations across three continents, according to his staff.",
        "SANDY SPRINGS, Ga. \u2014 As the most expensive House race in history heads into its final full week, there is one name that is rarely mentioned by the two people who are running. But President Trump looms over everything. As Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff was making his way through a retirement community here on a recent weekday, a woman named B. J. Mix gripped his hand and told him: \u201cWhen you get there, give Trump hell.",
        "Front doors swing open across Virginia\u2019s picturesque Shenandoah Valley, and Jennifer Brown pops what should be an easy question: Do you plan to vote in the Republican primary for governor? These are not just any front doors, but those belonging to reliable GOP primary voters, people fired up last year when Brown came \u2019round on behalf of Donald Trump. But the response days before Tuesday\u2019s gubernatorial primary is often a blank stare \u2014 something Democratic are also seeing in abundance.",
        "When Reality Winner was arrested last week under the Espionage Act for allegedly removing classified information from a government facility and mailing it to a news outlet, opponents of the Trump administration were quick to be alarmed. The federal contractor had been critical of President Trump on social media, and the document she allegedly leaked to the Intercept contained details of Russian attempts to hack into state and local election systems last fall \u2014 details that get to the heart of what Trump calls the \u201cfake news\u201d investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russian intelligence.",
        "When the news broke of the latest national security leaker, it was obvious she was a millennial. Reality Winner is a veteran, a (now former) analyst for the defense contractor Pluribus International and a yoga instructor. She is currently in federal custody, accused of sending a classified document about Russian hacks against a company to the Intercept, an online magazine. Three of the leakers in recent years \u2014 Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden and now Winner \u2014 were born between 1983 and 1993.",
        "Shortly after news broke last week about a possible terrorist attack in London, President Trump tweeted: \u201cWe need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\u201d Afterward, he was mocked for having exposed the seeming unconstitutionality of his ban, which the Supreme Court has been asked to review and which his lawyers have claimed is not a ban.",
        "Everyone should be so lucky as to have their high school demolished. It gives a timeless place an obituary, neatly summing up the most formative moment of your life. I grew up on a John Hughes film set in North Carolina. The tallest structure in town, the water tower, declared Apex \u201cthe PEAK of good living\u201d (caps theirs). My freshman year overlapped with the height of suburban sprawl, in 1994, the same year the state chamber of commerce dubbed Apex the No. 1 small town in North Carolina.",
        "From former FBI director James B. Comey\u2019s account this past week of his conversations with President Trump, a very clear, if disturbing, picture emerged of what the president worries most about. It\u2019s not broader questions of law, government or national security. He\u2019s got one paramount thing on his mind: himself. In written remarks submitted to the Senate Intelligence Committee as well as testimony before the panel Thursday, Comey painstakingly described meetings and phone calls in which the president didn\u2019t focus on threats from terrorism, crime or Russian hackers.",
        "ANOTHER WEEK, another insurance company deserting patients in a wide swath of the country. Last Tuesday, Anthem announced it would pull out of the Obamacare marketplace in Ohio, potentially leaving individual in about a fifth of the state\u2019s counties without Affordable Care Act coverage to purchase. The news came after insurers in various other states announced or threatened market exits or big rate hikes over the past several weeks. Are these moves more evidence that Obamacare is fundamentally unworkable? Hardly. Of greedy insurance companies callously disregarding their customers\u2019 health? Not that either.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 activists hoisted American flags and delivered fiery speeches in rallies across the country Saturday, facing off against crowds of in several cities and exposing the visceral rage that has come to define America\u2019s political extremes. ACT for America, a lobbyist organization with close ties to the Trump administration, organized nationwide marches to oppose Islamic law, which the group says is a threat to U. S. society.",
        "LONDON \u2014 The pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May to step aside following a humiliating election result grew Saturday, with her two top aides resigning, a leading newspaper pronouncing her \u201cfatally wounded\u201d and a former minister acknowledging that Tories were plotting possible replacements via the messaging service WhatsApp. The aides who resigned, Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy, May\u2019s fiercely loyal of staff, had been widely blamed within the prime minister\u2019s Conservative Party for the lackluster campaign that ended with the Tories losing their majority in Parliament.",
        "Adam West, the actor who portrayed the superhero Batman on television in the 1960s, and who seemed trapped in the character\u2019s cape and tights for the rest of his career, died June 9 in Los Angeles. He was 88. The cause was leukemia, his publicist, Molly Schoneveld, said in a statement. Other actors, including Michael Keaton, Ben Affleck, Val Kilmer and Oscar winners George Clooney and Christian Bale, have taken on the role of the Caped Crusader, but no one was as closely identified with the character as Mr. West.",
        "The girls, ages 1 and 2, were gravely ill when they arrived at the hospital. According to investigators, their mother made it sound like they\u2019d collapsed mysteriously on an otherwise idyllic day. \u201cThere\u2019s a lake close to where they were,\u201d Kerr County Sheriff Rusty Hierholzer told The Washington Post. \u201cShe said the little girls were walking around smelling flowers. She didn\u2019t know if maybe they\u2019d ingested or touched a poisonous flower. \u201d That was a lie, Hierholzer said.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019ve got time,\u201d Regina Spektor croons in the theme song that precedes each episode of \u201cOrange Is the New Black. \u201d For the inmates of Litchfield Penitentiary, that\u2019s not a comforting statement. And if you\u2019re settling in to watch the newest season of Netflix\u2019s hit dramedy, you\u2019re going to need time \u2014 and lots of it. That\u2019s because for all of the poignant and comical moments in Season 5 \u2014 and there are plenty \u2014 there is also a lot of filler. Litchfield went private at the start of last season, leading to an influx of inmates.",
        "It starts with a flicker of light. Two, three, four flashes follow. Minutes later, dozens of tiny yellow bulbs illuminate the forest like paparazzi hounding the Keebler elves. And then the woods go black. Show\u2019s over \u2014 at least for the next seconds. For two or three weeks in late May and early June, Great Smoky Mountains National Park pulsates with light and darkness, the beginning and end of life, and Photinus carolinus and Homo sapiens.",
        "Although elite athletes and experienced runners compete in the Marine Corps Marathon, it s widely recognized that the race is and . That means there ll be at the start on Oct. \u00c2 22, and . Like me. As I consider a typical beginner marathon training plan, it s hard not to notice how much my weekly mileage will increase throughout the summer months, which in Washington can be brutal. On top of that, the schedule includes three runs during the week, up to seven miles each.",
        "The wind is up in Wilson, N. C. Giant pinwheels and propellers start spinning atop tall and spindly kinetic sculptures called whirligigs, which have been erected on a village green being developed into Whirligig Park. The rotating wheels drive chains, belts and shafts that, in turn, set in motion whimsical characters and shapes. Little bicycle riders and unicyclists pedal and wave, helicopters hover, birds flap their wings, fighter planes change course. The fantastic contraptions have been fashioned from the discard pile of American civilization.",
        "MADISON, Wis. \u2014 With newly elected Scott Walker in the governor\u2019s office and a firm grip on the legislature, Wisconsin Republicans in 2011 had a unique opportunity to redraw the state\u2019s electoral maps and fortify their party\u2019s future. Aides were dispatched to a private law firm to keep their work out of public view. They employed the most precise technology available to dissect new U. S. Census data and convert it into reliably Republican districts even if the party\u2019s fortunes soured.",
        "Preet Bharara, the former U. S. attorney for the Southern District of New York ousted by President Trump, said Sunday that he had become increasingly uncomfortable with Trump\u2019s efforts to \u201ccultivate some kind of relationship\u201d with him and that his March firing came 22 hours after finally refusing to take a call from the president. In an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Bharara said Trump called him twice as \u201costensibly just to shoot the breeze.",
        "Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick could be required to leave the company temporarily as the service struggles to recover from months of controversies, according to multiple reports. Uber\u2019s board is considering the management move at a meeting Sunday, as well as a raft of other policy changes linked to a workplace culture report being prepared by a law firm and former U. S.

        "Roxane Gay begins her new book \u2014 the hardest she\u2019s ever had to write \u2014 by describing what it isn\u2019t. \u201cThe story of my body is not a story of triumph,\u201d Gay writes in the opening pages. \u201cMine is not a success story. \u201d Instead, it\u2019s a searing account of the essayist\u2019s lifelong struggle with her weight, which once topped 500 pounds. \u201cHunger: A Memoir of (My) Body\u201d is no memoir, she is quick to explain."
