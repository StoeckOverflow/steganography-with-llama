        "BRANCHBURG, N. J. \u2014 President Trump\u2019s plans for a state visit to Britain later this year appear to be up in the air, as he faces a backlash from across the pond for his criticism of London Mayor Sadiq Khan in the immediate aftermath of the June 3 terrorist attack in which eight people died. Due to previous comments Trump was already unpopular in the United Kingdom, and a visit of any sort could prompt large protests.",
        "LONDON \u2014 Prime Minister Theresa May reshuffled her cabinet a bit Sunday and mostly kept out of the public eye as she worked to strike a deal with a small party of unionists in Northern Ireland to prop up her government, which lacks a majority in Parliament. As May and her representatives wrangled with the Democratic Unionist Party, based in Belfast, her fellow Tories were grumbling that the Conservative prime minister had not only bungled the campaign but was performing poorly in the days after its surprising conclusion Thursday.",
        "On Sunday, Sen. Susan Collins ( ) said President Trump should turn over tapes of conversations he had with former FBI director James B. Comey \u2014 if they exist. \u201cHe should voluntarily turn them over not only to the Senate Intelligence Committee, but to the special counsel,\u201d Collins told Brianna Keilar on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand why the president just doesn\u2019t clear this matter up once and for all,\u201d she added.",
        "The thousands who came from across the country for the Equality March for Pride and Unity in the District on Sunday waved rainbow pride flags and walked beneath posters that read simply \u201cRemember Pulse. \u201d The mood at the march, organized as a demonstration to protect the rights of the broader gay community, was at times celebratory and at others somber as participants gathered to commemorate the anniversary of the worst mass shooting in U.

        "For several seconds, the only sound in the video is of someone sawing intently at a locked metal storage container in the middle of a wooded area. Moments later, several men try to pry open the doors with a crowbar. In the background, a dog barks. A police radio crackles. When the doors finally swing open, the men march into the dark container, declaring they\u2019re from the sheriff\u2019s office. One brandishes a gun. \u201cJust the girl, just the girl!\u201d an officer shouts from the back.",
        "The New York Daily News\u2019s front page on Friday morning screamed \u201cLIAR\u201d in huge type over a photo of President Trump. USA Today\u2019s banner headline seconded the motion: \u201cComey calls Trump a liar. \u201d On cable channels, in broadcast news, and even in the sedate Wall Street Journal, Friday morning was one of those days for Trump in the mainstream news media. In the words of the Judith Viorst children\u2019s book title, it was for Trump another terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day.",
        "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico \u2014 Puerto Ricans are getting the chance to tell the U. S. Congress on Sunday which political status they believe best benefits the U. S. territory as it remains mired in a deep economic crisis that has triggered an exodus of islanders to the mainland. Congress ultimately has to approve the outcome of Sunday\u2019s referendum that offers voters three choices: statehood, free or the current territorial status. Many expect statehood supporters to crowd voting centers because three of Puerto Rico\u2019s political parties are boycotting the referendum, including the island\u2019s main opposition party.",

        "AUSTIN \u2014 It had been billed as a \u201cMarch Against Sharia\u201d \u2014 one of many protests across the country against the feared subjugation, somehow, of Americans under Islam. But the few dozen sharia protesters who stood at the gates of the Texas statehouse didn\u2019t manage to march anywhere. They had failed to secure the permits for that.

        "Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s appearance Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee will be a test for a Trump official who has kept a low profile even as he has become a central figure in the scandal engulfing the White House over Russia and the firing of James B. Comey as FBI director. Sessions, a former Republican senator from Alabama, will face tough questions from his former colleagues on a number of fronts that he has never had to publicly address in detail.",

        "In life, as in literature, the more complex character is the more compelling and the more realistic. We may crave heroes, but we end up with humans. The cardboard figure of unblemished rectitude, who performs impeccably under pressure and is impelled only by the purest motives, gives way to a real person, with all the inevitable blemishes and failings that human nature is heir to. So it is with James B. Comey, the fired FBI director.",
        "The Republican gospel of cutting taxes and government services to the bone doesn\u2019t lead to economic growth; it leads to crisis and decline. Just ask the people of Kansas, who finally have seen the light. If House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) don\u2019t heed the Kansas lesson, they deserve to have their majorities stripped away in next year\u2019s midterms. And they won\u2019t be able to claim they weren\u2019t warned. The states are supposed to be laboratories for testing government policy.",

        "It has become a habit of journalism \u2014 one that was especially pronounced during the 2016 campaign \u2014 to write stories about how agonized voters are about choosing between candidates when they don\u2019t like either of them. Far less common are stories about the difficulty voters can have in picking between candidates when they rather like them both. Welcome to Tuesday\u2019s Virginia Democratic primary for governor. My strong hunch, based on the campaign itself and the polling I know about, is that Virginia Democrats will be happy to vote for either former congressman Tom Perriello or Lt. Gov.",

National media coverage was limited, a sad sign of how accustomed the country has become to these shootings, especially when \u201conly\u201d one child dies. But the damage from what happened on that playground in 12 deadly seconds extends far beyond those killed or wounded. That should further prod efforts to combat gun violence.",
