        "Attorney General Jeff Sessions repeatedly refused to answer questions from senators Tuesday about his private conversations with President Trump, including whether he spoke to Trump about former FBI director James B. Comey\u2019s handling of the investigation into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential race. In a number of testy exchanges with members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sessions said he would not answer many of their questions because of a Justice Department policy that he said protects private conversations between Cabinet secretaries and the president.",
        "Sen. James E. Risch ( ) made a comment during the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s questioning of Attorney General Jeff Sessions that has an obvious exception. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any American,\u201d Risch said, \u201cwho would disagree with the fact that we need to drill down to this\u201d \u2014 that is, Russian meddling in the 2016 election \u2014 \u201cknow what happened, get it out in front of the American people and do what we can to stop it again. \u201d There is one American, at least, who seems generally uninterested in that need: Sessions\u2019s boss, President Trump.",
        "Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s defense for failing to disclose two meetings with a Russian diplomat comes down to a critical distinction: At times during the presidential race, he acted as a surrogate for Donald Trump. At other times, he acted as a U. S. senator. The roles were separate, he insists, which is why a statement he made during a confirmation hearing in January \u2014 \u201cI did not have communications with the Russians\u201d \u2014 should not be viewed as dishonest.",
        "Attorney General Jeff Sessions is a star player in two key controversies about the Trump administration: the investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s connections with Russia and whether the president improperly interfered in an FBI investigation. Sessions was asked about all of this under oath Tuesday by the Senate Intelligence Committee, the lead congressional committee on Russia. Here are four key takeaways: 1) Sessions denied four major allegations against him with regard to the Russia investigation 1) He denied that he purposefully left out his two 2016 meetings with Russians at his confirmation hearing.",
        "On its face, the idea seemed as startling as it was preposterous: A president firing a special counsel appointed to investigate his campaign\u2019s possible role in Russia\u2019s interference with the 2016 U. S. election. But this president is Donald Trump, who speculates about firing people as sport and who dispatched with two key officials connected to the probe of Russia\u2019s election meddling during his first five months in office. To some of Trump\u2019s most loyal allies, terminating Robert S.",
        "Virginians began voting Tuesday to select candidates for this fall\u2019s election of governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and every seat in the House of Delegates, as well as other local offices. The nation is watching what otherwise would be a sleepy primary, with Virginia serving as a political laboratory for how the parties handle the deep divisions that followed last year\u2019s election of President Trump. The race for governor, especially, has focused nearly as much on reaction to events in Washington as to policy concerns within the state.",
        "Attorney General Jeff Sessions testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee Tuesday afternoon. Senators came ready to tear into him for untruthful confirmation hearing testimony about Russian conflicts; his decision to wade back into the Russia investigation and 2016 campaign issues in the context of the firing of former FBI director James B. Comey; his knowledge of pressure tactics wielded by the president on Comey; and his awareness of any taping system in the White House. The contrast with Comey was striking. Sessions, grayer and older, looked nervous and shrunken in his seat, growing defensive at times.",
        "In one of Walker Percy\u2019s brilliant novels, \u201cThe Second Coming,\u201d protagonist Will Barrett keeps falling down for no apparent reason. He also suffers trances during which he contemplates existential questions. Barrett comes to mind in the era of Donald Trump. I\u2019m not falling down on the golf course yet, as Barrett did, but I confess to a feeling of lightheadedness coupled with slight nausea. It makes perfect sense that Barrett finds salvation in a young woman recently released from an insane asylum.",
        "Monday was the first anniversary of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando that left 49 dead. Saturday will be the second anniversary of the church shooting in Charleston, S. C. where nine were murdered at Bible study. In between these two somber remembrances, House Republicans will be commemorating the occasion in their own way: They will begin work relaxing restrictions on firearm silencers \u2014 thereby making it easier for shooters to shoot without being noticed. Classy.",
        "The sign by my seat said, \u201cFasten seatbelt whilst seated,\u201d so clearly it was a British airline. My daughter and wife were alongside me and we were off to Europe for a break from the news. Our mad king had essentially been indicted in sworn testimony and he claimed vindication and offered to testify under oath, forgetting the one he\u2019d taken in January. Crazy times; it\u2019s good to go away. In London, the Brits were voting themselves into a deadlock, and the backrooms were busy with desperate dealmaking, according to the papers, but none of it affected us.",
        "Nicole Van Groningen is an internal medicine physician at the University of California at San Francisco. The last time you left your doctor\u2019s office with a new prescription, you probably assumed she thoughtfully selected it as the best treatment for your condition. But if your doctor \u2014 like half of American physicians \u2014 accepts visits and the occasional free lunch from pharmaceutical representatives, there\u2019s a good chance that drug choice was heavily biased. Physicians \u2014 myself included \u2014 aren\u2019t immune to the behavioral manipulation of marketers, and Big Pharma knows it.",
        "OTTO WARMBIER was a University of Virginia economics major with a bright future when he signed on for a short tourist trip to North Korea in December 2015. Not until Tuesday was he finally flown home to Cincinnati, gravely ill and reportedly in a coma. He was arrested, tried on spurious charges and evidently subjected to horrendous mistreatment by North Korean authorities. This was outrageous behavior even by the standards of one of the world\u2019s most vicious and isolated regimes. It should not go unpunished. By his account, delivered at a scripted \u201cnews conference\u201d weeks after his arrest, Mr.",
        "Billionaire businessman David Bonderman, a member of Uber s board, apologized Tuesday for making what he called an inappropriate ? comment about women at a meeting that was aimed at addressing the harassment of women and other unprofessional conduct within the company. The comment\u00c2 came as an interruption of fellow board member Arianna Huffington, who was explaining the benefits of having more female representation on Uber\u2019s board.",
        "The United States under President Trump is not retreating from global leadership as it asks other countries to do more, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson argued Tuesday. The world has changed. The world has changed dramatically, ? Tillerson said as he defended proposed State Department cuts of about 30 percent. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, among other leaders, has warned that allies cannot rely on the same set of assumptions about U. S. commitment and support.",
        "TOKYO \u2014 University of Virginia student Otto Warmbier has been medically evacuated from North Korea in a coma after being detained for 17 months, his parents told The Washington Post on Tuesday. Warmbier, 22, is due to arrive home in Cincinnati on Tuesday evening, after a stop at a U. S. military facility near Sapporo, Japan. The family said they were informed that North Korean officials had told American envoys that Warmbier became ill with botulism sometime after his March trial in North Korea, where he was serving a for \u201chostile acts against the state.",
        "Television reporters covering the Capitol were told midday Tuesday to stop recording interviews in Senate hallways, a dramatic and unexplained break with tradition that was soon reversed amid a wide rebuke from journalists, Democratic lawmakers and advocates. The episode heightened concerns about reporters\u2019 access to Washington leaders in an era when hostility toward the political media has increasingly become the norm. For some, the move to protect senators from impromptu interviews fell into a wider pattern of efforts to roll back press freedoms, whether by barring reporters from interviewing officials or denying them access to briefings, trips and events.",
        "Authorities in Georgia said they were searching for two inmates who killed a pair of prison guards and escaped early Tuesday morning while being transported through a rural area southeast of Atlanta. The inmates were on a prison bus traveling on State Route 16 in Putnam County when they overpowered the correctional officers on board, officials said. \u201cThey then disarmed them and one of the subjects shot and killed both guards,\u201d Howard R. Sills, the Putnam County sheriff, said in a statement. After overpowering the guards at about 5:45 a. m. the inmates took the guards\u2019 guns \u2014 .",
        "A man angry with President Trump unleashed a barrage of gunfire Wednesday morning at Republican members of Congress as they held a baseball practice at a park in Alexandria, wounding House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and four others in a frenzied scene that included a long gun battle with police. The gunman, James T. Hodgkinson, a unemployed home inspector from southern Illinois, died after the shootout. Two Capitol Police officers assigned to Scalise\u2019s security detail were wounded.",
        "The Republican lawmakers and their aides had nearly finished batting practice at an Alexandria park Wednesday when they heard a single crack through the sticky air. For a moment, the field went quiet as they wondered what the noise was. \u201cHe\u2019s got a gun!\u201d someone shouted. Then came a torrent of bullets, and there, behind a fence near third base, was a man with a rifle. One round hit Steve Scalise, the majority whip from Louisiana, in the hip, dropping him to the ground.",
        "One of the first lawmakers to try to visit Rep. Steve Scalise ( .) in the hospital Wednesday was Rep. Cedric L. Richmond, the fiery Democrat from a neighboring Louisiana district. Old friends from the Louisiana legislature, these two political polar opposites sometimes appear at local business events together around New Orleans, often turning to the annual Congressional Baseball Game in their friendly but competitive banter. So when Richmond arrived at MedStar Washington Hospital Center after Scalise was among those shot at Wednesday\u2019s Republican baseball practice, the GOP whip\u2019s staff delivered a message about the annual . game Thursday.",
        "The Illinois man suspected of firing dozens of rounds at a Congressional baseball practice in Alexandria Wednesday morning was highly critical of President Trump and other Republican leaders on social media, and had volunteered for the presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders. Law enforcement officials were still investigating what motivated James T. Hodgkinson, 66, whose attack injured five people, including a GOP lawmaker and two Capitol police officers. Hodgkinson, who died after a shootout with police, worked as a home inspector and lived with his wife in Belleville, a suburb of St. Louis.",
        "In the charged environment of 2017, it took only a few hours for a baseball diamond to be transformed from a peaceful practice field to a horrific crime scene and then to a vivid symbol of the tensions between the angry politics of our time and the better angels of the American people. From President Trump to congressional leaders of both parties to ordinary citizens came calls for prayers for the victims of the shootings in Alexandria, Va.",
        "The special counsel overseeing the investigation into Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 election is interviewing senior intelligence officials as part of a widening probe that now includes an examination of whether President Trump attempted to obstruct justice, officials said. The move by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III to investigate Trump\u2019s conduct marks a major turning point in the nearly FBI investigation, which until recently focused on Russian meddling during the presidential campaign and on whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.",
        "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell once had passionate views about how carefully Congress should consider sweeping changes to the system. \u201c a major legislative overhaul such as health care reform or a new national energy tax without the benefit of a full and transparent debate does a disservice to the American people,\u201d McConnell said in 2009, referring to the two big issues of the moment. Democrats using such means, he added, \u201cwould make it absolutely clear they intend to carry out their plans on a purely partisan basis.",
        "In case you didn\u2019t notice, Britain just held an election and the ruling Conservative Party, which had expected to win by a landslide, got hammered. The experts had given Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, almost no chance to win. To be sure, he campaigned on a platform of stringent opposition to long years of austerity \u2014 a message that resonated especially with students and the discontented. But still, who would vote for a Marxist, a man who has publicly flirted with the IRA and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Hamas?",
        "Acts of murderous political violence are not new in America. In and of themselves, they do not tell us much about the state of the country and its political culture. What\u2019s revealing, however, is how Americans respond, and the political meaning we ascribe to senseless acts by madmen. There is appalling symmetry in the fact that James T. Hodgkinson III of Belleville, Ill. tried to massacre Republican lawmakers shortly after the first anniversary of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U. S. history.",
        "OSSINING, N. Y. Sparkling in the sunlight that inspired romantic painters of the Hudson River School, Sing Sing prison\u2019s razor wire, through which inmates can see the flowing river, is almost pretty. Almost. Rain or shine, however, a fog of regret permeates any prison. But 37 men \u2014 almost all minorities; mostly African Americans \u2014 recently received celebratory attention. It was their commencement \u2014 attended by Harry Belafonte, 90, and the singer Usher \u2014 as freshly minted college graduates.",
        "There was an eerie silence in the House chamber when the gavel fell to open Wednesday morning\u2019s session. This was supposed to be the time for \u201c \u201d speeches, those short partisan jabs and . But not a single lawmaker was on the floor, the benches and speakers\u2019 tables all empty. Without even the invocation or the pledge, the speaker pro tempore immediately declared the still chamber in recess. The partisan guns had been silenced by a real one.",
        "The Senate voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to allow Congress to block any efforts by the president to scale back sanctions against Russia, and to strengthen those sanctions in retaliation for Moscow\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 election and its actions in Syria. The vote of 97 to 2 is a sharp rebuke to President Trump\u2019s posture on Russia and his resistance to the intelligence community\u2019s assessment that the country was behind efforts to influence the election he won. The two senators who voted against the measure were Republicans Rand Paul (Ky.) and Mike Lee (Utah).",

C. authorities will announce criminal charges Thursday against 12 members of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s security detail and the police force who authorities say attacked protesters outside the ambassador\u2019s residence last month, according to two officials familiar with the case. Authorities have scheduled an 11:45 a. m. news conference with D. C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) and D. C. Police Chief Peter Newsham. Police officials say arrest warrants have been issued and that the suspects, all believed to be in Turkey, are now wanted in the United States."
