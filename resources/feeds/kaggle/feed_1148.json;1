        "President Trump\u2019s decision to delegate authority to the Pentagon to set troop levels in Afghanistan has raised concerns that a few thousand additional troops expected to deploy soon could be just the beginning of a new surge in the country after 15 years of war. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis assured lawmakers Wednesday that a large increase in deployed forced will not happen, but some experts and former battlefield commanders warned the White House and Congress should be careful not to give the Pentagon a blank check. There are currently about 8, 500 U. S.",
        "LONDON \u2014 Through the night and deep into the day, the crackling fire raged, sweeping through apartments and destroying lives like an inferno from an earlier century, or perhaps from a part of the world. But this was London. This was 2017. And Wednesday\u2019s fire was unlike any seen here in recent memory, a blaze that transformed a that was once home to about 500 people into a charred ruin on the city\u2019s otherwise gleaming skyline.",
        "The National Security Agency has linked the North Korean government to the creation of the WannaCry computer worm that affected more than 300, 000 people in some 150 countries last month, according to U. S. intelligence officials. The assessment, which was issued internally last week and has not been made public, is based on an analysis of tactics, techniques and targets that point with \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d to North Korea\u2019s spy agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, according to an individual familiar with the report.",
        "A Southern Baptist Convention proposal to condemn a white nationalist group drew some backlash during the convention\u2019s annual meeting on Tuesday when a committee first declined to bring a proposed resolution to a vote. But Southern Baptist leaders worked on the language late last night, and the convention will vote Wednesday at 5:45 p. m. Eastern time on the resolution condemning the movement \u2014 a small, movement that seeks a state. The debate over the resolution highlights the many divisions within the denomination around the election of President Trump, which put the spotlight on white supremacists among his supporters.",
        "Considered one of the founders of American modernism, Charles Sheeler ( ) turned from painting to photography as a way to make a living. His early work included a series focused on his house in Doylestown, Pa. These photographs proved to be some of the most abstract work being produced in the United States at the time. Sheeler continued to photograph architecture, from barns in Pennsylvania to cityscapes in Manhattan. He said the barns\u2019 \u201cbuilders weren\u2019t building a work of art. If it\u2019s beautiful to some of us afterward, it\u2019s beautiful because it functioned.",
        "In a city often known for its ugly politics, the Congressional Baseball Game was that rare bird: an event that brought lawmakers from both sides of the aisle together for a day of genuinely competition. The baseball game\u2019s official website bills it as \u201cthe only annual partisan showdown beloved by all and enjoyed by thousands. \u201d It\u2019s seen as a : Proceeds go to charity, and lawmakers engage their competitive spirit while demonstrating their hometown pride before a crowd that regularly hits about 10, 000.",
        "CINCINNATI \u2014 Otto Warmbier, who was medically evacuated from a detention in North Korea this week, has extensive loss of brain tissue and is in a state of unresponsive wakefulness, University of Cincinnati doctors said Thursday afternoon. Doctors said they don\u2019t know what caused the brain damage. When asked whether it could be the result of beating or other violence while in prison, they said that Warmbier did not show any obvious indications of trauma, nor evidence of either acute or healing fractures.",
        "WYOMING, Ohio \u2014 Wearing the jacket his son Otto Warmbier wore at the sham trial that ended with his imprisonment in North Korea, Fred Warmbier denounced the \u201cpariah\u201d regime that had brutalized his son and fought back tears Thursday as he talked about kneeling to hug him when he was returned to the United States in a coma. \u201cThe fact that he was taken and treated this way is horrible,\u201d Fred Warmbier said. \u201cThey\u2019re brutal and they\u2019re terroristic. We see the results of their actions, with Otto.",
        "Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III is investigating the finances and business dealings of Jared Kushner, President Trump s and adviser, as part of the investigation into Russia s interference in the 2016 presidential election, according to officials familiar with the matter. FBI agents and federal prosecutors have also been examining the financial dealings of other Trump associates, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn, former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Carter Page, who was listed as a adviser for the campaign.",
        "Vice President Pence has hired outside legal counsel to help with both congressional committee inquiries and the special counsel investigation into possible collusion between President Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia. The vice president\u2019s office said Thursday that Pence has retained Richard Cullen, a lawyer and chairman of McGuireWoods who previously served as a U. S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia. Pence\u2019s decision comes less than a month after Trump hired his own private attorney, Marc E.",
        "On Wednesday night, The Post reported that special counsel Robert Mueller, appointed to investigate attempts by Russia to meddle in the 2016 election, had expanded that investigation to include possible obstruction of justice by President Trump. \u201cThe move by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III to investigate Trump\u2019s conduct,\u201d we wrote, \u201cmarks a major turning point in the nearly FBI investigation, which until recently focused on Russian meddling during the presidential campaign and on whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.",
        "Last month President Trump apparently told the Russians he fired FBI director James B. Comey to relieve pressure on him. Except, in firing Comey, Trump has upped the pressure cooker he\u2019s in by a factor of 10. \u201cI\u2019m not under investigation,\u201d Trump then told the Russian foreign minister in the Oval Office, according to the New York Times. Now, it appears he is. The Washington Post reported Wednesday that special counsel Robert S.",
        "Law enforcement officials worked Thursday to piece together the final nomadic months of the shooter whose anger toward President Trump apparently erupted in a rage of gunfire that left House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and four others wounded on a baseball field. Among the many questions for investigators is whether the gunman \u2014 James T. Hodgkinson, a unemployed home inspector from southern Illinois \u2014 had long planned Wednesday\u2019s assault and possibly studied the movements of lawmakers in the months he spent living in his van in northern Virginia.",
        "For those of us who experience gun violence via movies or television, the single bullet wound to the hip that House Majority Whip Steve Scalise suffered in a ballfield shooting Wednesday would seem less serious than what could have happened to him. After all, he wasn\u2019t hit in the head or chest, which can be immediately fatal. But even a single penetrating wound to the pelvic region, which is densely packed with blood vessels, organs and other structures, is extremely dangerous, according to trauma surgeons and emergency medical personnel.",
        "Kenneth W. Starr, a former U. S. solicitor general and federal judge, served as independent counsel in the Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky investigations during the Clinton administration. In the natural rhythm of government, June is ordinarily the Supreme Court\u2019s month to take center stage as it frenetically issues opinions before adjourning for the summer. This year is starkly different \u2014 at least so far. Even with the arrival of the newest justice, the court has been largely eclipsed by the drama unfolding one block away in the Senate and a few miles away at the White House.",
        "Frederick J. Ryan Jr. is publisher and chief executive of The Washington Post. Katharine Graham, the iconic former publisher of The Washington Post, was born 100 years ago Friday. We remember her on this centennial not only for her deep and lasting contributions to The Post, but also for her unwavering commitment to the journalistic values that continue to guide news organizations across the country.

        "Tragedies such as the attack on a congressional baseball team cry out for interpretation, and resist it. By intention or not, the shooter was strategic in his malice, going after one of Washington\u2019s few remaining symbols of openness and normality. Members of Congress \u2014 who are some of the best, most interesting people I know \u2014 spend much of their time treated either like or like beggars at the gate, asking for money and votes. Sport is a rare chance to be teammates and friends. Political violence, among other horrible things, makes it harder to be human in public.",
        "President Trump now finds himself exactly where he doesn\u2019t want to be: under investigation by a dogged, highly respected prosecutor who owes him no personal or political loyalty. And the president has only himself to blame. Trump let off some steam Thursday morning by issuing a couple of angry statements on Twitter: \u201cThey made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice.",
        "The sudden embargo on Qatar pushed this month by the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia has peeved the State Department and Pentagon, drawing sharp criticism of those two close Persian Gulf allies. The Qatar flap has also opened a fascinating window on the inner workings of the Trump administration\u2019s foreign policy. It\u2019s a rare instance in which Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the quiet man on the Trump team, appears to have persuaded the president to back off his initial course and, as a White House official put it, \u201clet Rex handle it,\u201d at least for now.",
        "MARYLAND AND the District sued President Trump on Monday, and on Wednesday 196 Democrats in Congress agreed to file their own lawsuits against the president. Each claim that Mr. Trump has violated the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause, which bars government officials from accepting \u201cany present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State\u201d without Congress\u2019s consent.

        "Shares in Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp. tumbled in trading Thursday after the Northern consultant disclosed through a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that its billing practices were under investigation by the Justice Department. The company\u2019s stock fell about 12 percent. The firm said in a statement on its website that the Justice Department informed it this month that it was \u201cconducting a civil and criminal investigation relating to certain elements of the company\u2019s cost accounting and indirect cost charging practices with the U. S. government.",
        "NORRISTOWN, Pa. \u2014 The jury in Bill Cosby\u2019s sexual assault trial informed the judge late Thursday morning that it is deadlocked on all three counts of aggravated indecent assault against the comedian. Judge Steven T. O\u2019Neill ordered the panel to return to the jury room to keep trying. It was a dramatic turn of events in a trial entering its ninth day, including four days of deliberations. The note explaining the status of the jury\u2019s deliberations was 11:06 a. m.",
        "Two weeks ago in the Rose Garden, President Trump declared that under his leadership, foreign leaders won\u2019t be \u201claughing at us anymore. \u201d Since then, he\u2019s been the butt of jokes in capitals across the globe. In Mexico, former president Vicente Fox posted a profane video on YouTube mocking Trump\u2019s taste for taco bowls (\u201cthey\u2019re not even Mexican! \u201d) and border walls (\u201cMexico will not pay\u201d) that has been viewed nearly half a million times.

        "Federal authorities say polygamist religious leader Lyle Jeffs has been captured, almost exactly one year after he escaped from home confinement while he was accused in a fraud scheme. Jeffs, who fled from federal custody last summer in Salt Lake City, was arrested Wednesday night without incident at a marina more than 900 miles away in Yankton, S. D. the FBI said. \u201cWe knew that this was just a matter of time,\u201d Eric Barnhart, FBI Special Agent in Charge for the Salt Lake City Division, said Thursday at a news conference.",
        "The Minnesota police officer who fatally shot Philando Castile during a traffic stop was acquitted on all charges by a jury Friday, a decision that came nearly a year after the encounter was partially streamed online to a rapt nation in the midst of a painful reckoning over shootings by law enforcement. Officer Jeronimo Yanez pulled Castile\u2019s car over in Falcon Heights, a suburb near Minneapolis and St. Paul, and the officer later said he thought Castile matched the description of a suspect in a robbery. The stop quickly escalated.",
        "President Trump fired off tweets Friday morning attacking the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, and apparently, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein. I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt \u2014 Donald J.

        "Vice President Pence turned 58 on the same day that two senior intelligence officials fielded questions before a Senate committee about the FBI\u2019s ongoing Russia probe \u2014 and one day before fired FBI Director James B. Comey appeared before the same committee to discuss why he believed President Trump had acted inappropriately. The rounds of testimony were merely the latest signs of a presidency in the grip of tumult. But flying down to Houston that morning for an astronaut event, Pence didn\u2019t seem to have a care in the world.",
        "MIAMI \u2014 President Trump, denouncing what he called his predecessor\u2019s \u201cterrible and misguided\u201d opening to Cuba, outlined a new policy Friday that seeks to curb commercial dealings with the government in Havana and to limit the newfound freedom of U. S. citizens to travel to the island. \u201cEffective immediately, I am canceling the last administration\u2019s completely deal with Cuba,\u201d Trump told an enthusiastic audience, heavily weighted with members of South Florida\u2019s Cuban American community who opposed former president Barack Obama\u2019s normalization of relations with the communist government of President Ra\u00fal Castro.",
        "HAVANA \u2014 Cuban families gathered anxiously around their television sets in March 2016 when President Barack Obama made his pitch to the Cuban people at the Grand Theater in Old Havana. His message, mostly about restoring ties between the American and Cuban people and healing divisions, stirred up a lot of emotions. Tears were shed. There was catharsis. On Friday, President Trump\u2019s speech appeared to bring a lot more cursing. Fewer Cubans seemed to tune in the speech, although it was broadcast live on state television by the Telesur network."
