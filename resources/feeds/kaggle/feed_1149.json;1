        "Whole Foods is known for its human touch: smiling cashiers, bakers offering free samples, baristas pouring kombucha on tap. Amazon is known for replacing stores with Web pages and workers with algorithms. On Friday, the companies got engaged: Amazon announced plans to purchase the upscale grocery chain in a deal valued at $13. 7 billion. Now, at a time when retail jobs are already in free fall, worker advocates worry that many of Whole Foods\u2019 90, 000 employees may be next.",
        "TOKYO \u2014 A U. S. Navy destroyer, the USS Fitzgerald, collided with a container ship off the coast of Japan early Saturday morning, causing significant damage and flooding. Local broadcaster NHK reported that seven sailors were missing, while the U. S. Navy said one sailor was being medically evacuated.

        "President Trump retains control of assets that as of April 15 were worth at least $1. 4 billion and had generated nearly $600 million in gross revenues in the previous 15\u00bd months, according to a new financial disclosure released Friday. The report, which the president voluntarily filed with the Office of Government Ethics, underscores the unprecedented financial interests Trump has brought with him to the Oval Office, an arrangement that has generated sharp criticism and spurred legal challenges.",
        "PARIS Will millennials save the West? Many commentators seem confident that the answer is yes \u2014 that young people\u2019s values will be a moderating influence on their insular, xenophobic, parents. But this complacency may be misplaced. Young people \u2014 or at least a large swath of them \u2014 do appear to be growing more . On several key metrics, though, they also appear to be growing more illiberal, and more radical. In Britain, young voters showed up en masse last week to help crack the Conservative Party\u2019s comfortable majority in Parliament.",
        "Fulfilling a lifelong wish, my wife and I walked Omaha Beach this past week, as well as Utah Beach, the Pegasus Bridge and many other places familiar to anyone who has read a book or watched a movie devoted to and the weeks that followed 73 years ago. Outside of the United States, with spotty WiFi and only Sky News, the BBC and CNN International on which to rely, the impression of the country is quite different than it is inside the Beltway.

        "Now we\u2019ve done it. We\u2019ve hurt Ivanka Trump\u2019s feelings. \u201cThere\u2019s a level of viciousness that I was not expecting,\u201d the presidential daughter and senior White House official told Fox News this week, adding that she was \u201cblindsided\u201d by the \u201cferocity. \u201d The poor dear.

        "A common reaction to Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has been a sense that reality has outstripped even the most feverish fiction. The only thing to do when the world has come to feel like the implausible output of an ambitious but not particularly talented television writer is to cover it that way. Welcome to our recaps of \u201cThe Trump Show. \u201d At this point in the series\u2019 run, I feel like I don\u2019t need to note that that this week, \u201cThe Trump Show\u201d ground through plot points at an exhausting rate.",

        "Congress is considering a bill that would expand the federal government\u2019s ability to pursue the war on drugs, granting new power to the attorney general to set federal drug policy. The bipartisan legislation, sponsored by powerful committee chairs in both chambers of Congress, would allow the attorney general to unilaterally outlaw certain unregulated chemical compounds on a temporary basis. It would create a special legal category for these drugs, the first time in nearly 50 years that the Controlled Substances Act has been expanded in this way.",
        "Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is reassigning dozens of top career officials within his ranks, a that appears to be the start of a broad reorganization of a department that manages of all land within the United States.

        "One of the most unusual sights in country music is a singer speaking out against country radio. In Nashville, radio is known as the gatekeeper \u2014 if you can\u2019t get a radio hit, there\u2019s a slim chance you\u2019ll find mainstream success. So although artists are often frustrated with the system, they keep it to themselves.

        "Fat Leonard ran a lot of corrupt schemes with the help of the U. S. Navy, but one of the strangest may be the time he was granted U. S. diplomatic immunity.

He was 87. Mr. Kohl\u2019s party, the Christian Democratic Union, confirmed the death in a tweet but did not provide other information.

For Aghors, the cremation ground is a pure and peaceful place, were they can meditate with the flames of the funeral pyres. (Tamara Merino) These people eat human flesh.

        "It\u2019s been two years and a day since President Trump announced his candidacy for the top office \u2014 and the Republican Party hasn\u2019t been the same since. Trump upended the traditional GOP politics, and his presidency offers evidence of strains within the party that aren\u2019t going away anytime soon. Anyone looking for evidence could see it in the results of last week\u2019s Republican gubernatorial primary in Virginia. Many analysts believed Ed Gillespie, the former Republican National Committee chairman and adviser to President George W. Bush, would cruise to victory in the primary.",

Bernie Sanders ( . ).",
        "The American traveler in Cuba \u2014 sweating, disoriented and probably a bit woozy from the rum drinks \u2014 is once more at the heart of the struggle for the island\u2019s future. Central to President Trump\u2019s plans to peel back his predecessor\u2019s detente with Cuba is the idea that there is \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d U. S. travel. The United States, Trump believes, can tightly regulate American vacations to deprive the Castro government of dollars and redirect the money to the island\u2019s growing class of entrepreneurs.",

        "NORRISTOWN, Pa. \u2014 A Pennsylvania judge declared a mistrial Saturday after a jury was deadlocked on charges against Bill Cosby, the comic legend whose legacy as a promoter of wholesome values has been tarnished by a sex and drugging scandal. As the mistrial was declared, Cosby sat at the defense table with his chin held high, a flat, blank look on his face. Across the well of the courtroom, jurors stood in the jury box and said, \u201cYes,\u201d as Judge Steven T. O\u2019Neill asked each whether they agreed that the jury is \u201chopelessly deadlocked.",

        "I am the parent of five millennials. Three I fathered, and two I got in a brilliant merger when I married their mother in 1997. It takes nothing less than a miracle to be the father of five young adults: Namely, they all have to make it through childhood. Really it\u2019s a boatload of miracles, small and large. They have to survive broken bones and febrile seizures and asthma attacks and tumors that turn out to be cysts. Thousands of cars have to swerve out of their way as they learn to drive.",
