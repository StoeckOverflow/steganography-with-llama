        "The sorry lot of the Capitol Hill junior staffer is to answer phones, pore over files, and make lunch runs. But for one glorious summer in 1973, interns and drudges helped change America \u2014 as the cogs turning the wheel that would ultimately result in Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation. \u201cThey were doing literally all of the grunt work,\u201d remembers former senator Lowell Weicker ( .) the last surviving politician who served on the Senate\u2019s Watergate committee.",
        "After a night of protests following the acquittal of officer Jeronimo Yanez in the shooting death of Philando Castile on Friday, black activists in the Twin Cities are struggling to balance despair at the outcome with the hope that it could turn into a catalyst as they seek a broader movement for police reform. [Minn.",
        "In Richmond, people debate their favorite sky blue paint color for porch ceilings like they do their favorite biscuit recipe. It s all about bringing the outside in, ? says designer Suellen Gregory, who says she s seen them on front and back porches, porches, loggias and garden rooms. My clients do ask for it. It puts an interesting spin on what would be just a plain white ceiling. ? Across the South, the tradition of painting ceilings blue is passed down from generation to generation.",
        "I joined in a wave of the intermittent fasting trend about 10 years ago \u2014 before I was a dietitian. That\u2019s when most of the writings on the topic were in the form of blog posts and PDF . Today, a perusal of the Internet turns up several books extolling the benefits of intermittent fasting for weight loss and improvements in the metabolic risk factors that contribute to Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Then, and even now, the intermittent fasting hype was way ahead of the science.",
        "A friend of mine recently told me about a time in college when she and her buds decided to throw an party in the picnic area near their dorm. Most of them were still slightly underage, so openly bringing of beer was a recipe for trouble. But they were college kids, majoring in liberal arts and minoring in high jinks. There was no way The Man (or the notoriously RA who ran their dorm with an iron scrunchie) was going to keep them from their illegal imbibery, so one of them suggested they make a drunken watermelon.",
        "ISLAMABAD \u2014 As American military officials complete plans that will likely send several thousand additional U. S. troops to Afghanistan, a flurry of setbacks in the war has underscored both the imperative of action and the pitfalls of various approaches. Further complicating the picture are questions about how to deal with Pakistan and balance separate fights against Afghan and insurgents. In the latest attack Sunday morning, Taliban fighters stormed a police base in southeastern Paktia Province after exploding a suicide car bomb outside. At least five security forces and several civilians were killed, officials said.",
        "A U. S. strike aircraft shot down a Syrian government fighter jet Sunday shortly after the Syrians bombed U. S. fighters in northern Syria, the Pentagon said in a statement. The Pentagon said the downing of the aircraft came hours after Syrian loyalist forces attacked U. S. fighters, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, in the village of Ja\u2019Din, southwest of Raqqa. The rare attack was the first time a U. S. jet has shot down a manned hostile aircraft in more than a decade, and signaled the United States\u2019 sharply intensifying role in Syria\u2019s war.",
        "A member of President Trump\u2019s legal team repeatedly insisted that Trump is not under investigation for obstruction of justice but acknowledged he could not know for certain during combative Sunday television interviews. \u201cLet me be very clear here, as it has been since the beginning, the president is not and has not been under investigation for obstruction,\u201d lawyer Jay Sekulow said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d part of a blitz of bookings on the Sunday morning public affairs shows.",
        "New York June 16, 2015 Donald Trump stepped onto the golden escalator that descends into the food court of Trump Tower. He flashed a as he passed a line of supposed supporters \u2014 random tourists lured off the street with the promise of an \u201conly in New York\u201d experience \u2014 and inched toward the reporters seated below. In a rambling speech, he marveled at the crowd size, called Mexican immigrants \u201crapists,\u201d declared that \u201cChina is killing us\u201d and vowed to make America great once again.",
        "The unique research and production facility is located at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in New Mexico, the birthplace of the U. S. atomic arsenal. The lab\u2019s director ordered the shutdown in 2013 after the Washington official in charge of America\u2019s warhead production expressed worries that the facility was to prevent an accident that would kill its workers and potentially others nearby. Parts of the facility began renewed operations last year, but with only partial success.",
        "I can\u2019t stop thinking about Otto Warmbier. And the more I think about him, the more I remember all the smart people I\u2019ve heard over the years explaining why the North Korean regime \u2014 the regime that \u201cbrutalized and terrorized\u201d Otto, as his father said last week \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be challenged or destabilized. Warmbier is a smart and immensely likable kid who graduated from high school in 2013 in his hometown of Wyoming, Ohio, and enrolled in the University of Virginia.",
        "Dozens of young minority and female State Department recruits received startling and unwelcome news last week: They would not be able to soon join the Foreign Service despite having been promised that opportunity. Their saga is just the latest sign that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s rush to slash the size of the State Department without a plan is harming diplomacy and having negative unintended effects. The recruits, who are part of the State Department\u2019s Rangel and Pickering fellowship programs, have already completed two years of education at U. S.",
        "Let it be said that for one lovely moment, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi responded exactly as those in authority should to a shocking assault on human lives and our political system. After last Wednesday\u2019s shooting on a baseball field, both spoke in a spirit of thoughtful solidarity and genuinely mutual concern. Kudos to them. Unfortunately, so much else that has been said over the past few days is \u2014 I will use a term \u2014 balderdash.",
        "Ever since President Trump\u2019s election, a cottage industry of politicians, journalists, scholars and commentators has sought to understand what motivates Trump supporters. Theories have ranged from globalization to a rebellion against Washington elitism to racism. But the true cause may have been overlooked: the \u201cpostindustrial society. \u201d It has imposed on the economy a wage structure that systematically generates inequality between the majority of Americans and the upper middle class, roughly defined as the top 20 percent with a threshold income of a bit more than $100, 000.",
        "OBAMACARE LOOKS shaky, mostly because Republicans are sabotaging it. This, in turn, has rekindled calls on the left to create a \u201c \u201d system, in which the government directly pays for every American\u2019s health care. California lawmakers, for example, are considering such a plan for their state. The model has some strong advantages. It is much simpler for most people \u2014 no more insurance forms or related hassles. Employers would no longer be mixed up in providing benefits, and taxpayers would no longer subsidize that form of private compensation.",
        "PARIS \u2014 Emmanuel Macron was projected to win a large parliamentary majority Sunday, with the centrist party he founded little more than a year ago triumphing at the polls. Although the result was expected after an earlier round of voting last week, the rise of Macron\u2019s party represented a watershed moment in modern French politics. In a system that has only ever been governed by the or the Sunday\u2019s vote marked the beginning of a French \u201cthird way,\u201d a government from the center that once seemed impossible.",
        "BELLEVILLE, ILL. \u2014 On the western edge of town, where midcentury suburban streets give way to cornfields and farms, a weathered barn sits among neat rows of soybeans. This bucolic stretch was long accessible only via a gravel lane, and the barn was one of the only buildings. A few miles to the east, a renaissance has been transforming Main Street after decades of decline. A stately fountain marks the official seat of St. Clair County. The old brick storefronts host trendy restaurants and boutiques.",
        "An organization that opposes the Republican effort to repeal and replace key parts of the Affordable Care Act is pressuring five GOP senators not to vote for the emerging legislation in a new $1. 5 million ad campaign that begins Monday, officials with the group told The Washington Post. Community Catalyst Action Fund, which bills itself as a consumer health organization, is targeting Sens. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) Jeff Flake (Ariz.) Susan Collins (Maine) Dean Heller (Nev.) and Shelley Moore Capito (W. Va.) with television and radio ads urging them to vote no.",
        "They almost surely will meet again in a court of law. One more time, the lanky former jock with the gait and the mound of curly hair is likely to sit across a courtroom from the lumbering and aging comedian who has made an elegant wooden cane his signature prop on the most dangerous stage of his storied career. The mistrial declared Saturday morning set the scene for a courtroom rematch between Andrea Constand, a former women\u2019s professional basketball player, and Bill Cosby, the comic legend who she says drugged and sexually assaulted her.",
        "BAMAKO, Mali \u2014 Suspected jihadists attacked a hotel resort Sunday in Mali\u2019s capital, taking hostages at a spot popular with foreigners on the weekends. The number of casualties was unclear in the assault, which continued into the evening, authorities said. Gunfire first rang out at the Campement Kangaba on the outskirts of Bamako in the late afternoon, according to a security official with the U. N. mission known as MINUSMA. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters.",
        "YOKOSUKA, Japan \u2014 In the dark of night the weather was clear, with a swell of about six feet. Near where the sea lanes converge for the run into Tokyo Bay, the USS Fitzgerald was on a routine mission \u2014 though in these waters, mariners say, routine means always taking extra caution. One of the Navy\u2019s most advanced ships, the Aegis destroyer was equipped with the latest and most sophisticated radar equipment. Onboard the vessel was a crew of 300. On the bridge, a full complement of officers and enlisted personnel was on duty. The commanding officer, Cmdr.",
        "Amid the national fury over the death of Philando Castile at a traffic stop in July \u2014 a shooting made more horrific by his girlfriend\u2019s Facebook Live broadcast of his final moments \u2014 some condemned the National Rifle Association\u2019s near silence on the matter. The organization had been quick to defend other gun owners who made national news. Castile had a valid permit for his firearm, reportedly told the officer about it to avoid a confrontation, and was fatally shot anyway after being told to hand over his license.",
        "In 2013, Steven Hanes visited his urologist, complaining of persistent pain in his right testicle. An ultrasound revealed that the testicle had atrophied, with scarring and damage from a previous injury, according to court documents. And so the doctor scheduled an orchiectomy \u2014 or surgical removal of the testicle \u2014 to help alleviate Hanes\u2019s pain. The good news? The orchiectomy was successful. The bad news? The doctor removed the wrong testicle during the surgery.",
        "Otto Warmbier, the University of Virginia student who was detained in North Korea for nearly a year and a half, died Monday afternoon, his parents announced. Warmbier had been medically evacuated and returned to Cincinnati last week in a coma. Fred and Cindy Warmbier said in a written statement that they watched their son\u2019s face change, in the days that followed, from anguished to peaceful. \u201cHe was home and we believe he could sense that. \u201d Warmbier\u2019s death was mourned by both his wide circle of friends and by complete strangers, and it intensified political reaction to his detention.",
        "SANDY SPRINGS, Ga. \u2014 President Trump faces a political test on Tuesday in a special congressional election that has turned into a referendum on his leadership and could have significant consequences for his stalled agenda on Capitol Hill. On the eve of the vote to fill a House seat in Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District, Trump acknowledged that a Republican defeat in a district the party has held for nearly four decades could have wide implications. \u201cThe Dems want to stop tax cuts, good healthcare and Border Security. Their ObamaCare is dead with 100% increases in P\u2019s.",
        "The Supreme Court declared Monday that it will consider whether gerrymandered election maps favoring one political party over another violate the Constitution, a potentially fundamental change in the way American elections are conducted. The justices regularly are called to invalidate state electoral maps that have been illegally drawn to reduce the influence of racial minorities by depressing the impact of their votes. [Supreme Court says Virginia redistricting must be reexamined for racial bias] But the Supreme Court has never found a plan unconstitutional because of partisan gerrymandering.",
        "The Supreme Court just made a major decision without actually issuing a decision. On Monday morning, the justices announced that they would take up a case out of Wisconsin that could result in a ruling on the constitutionality of partisan gerrymandering. Democrats should be cautiously very happy with this. No, it doesn\u2019t mean that the Supreme Court will suddenly strike down the practice altogether, but it does mean that the court could deliver what would be basically an unprecedented rebuke of a practice that has, according to a recent study, prevented Democrats from controlling the U. S.",
        "LONDON \u2014 A van plowed into a group of Muslim worshipers leaving prayers at a pair of north London mosques early Monday, leaving one person dead and injuring 10 others in what is being called a \u201cterrorist attack. \u201d Witnesses said the driver of the vehicle was heard shouting that he wanted to kill Muslims. \u201cThis is being treated as a terrorist attack,\u201d said Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu told reporters.

        "Donald Trump tweeted about the terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015 about 3\u00bd hours after they occurred. The following month, he tweeted about the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. 90 minutes after the violence began. It took fewer than 12 hours from the time an EgyptAir flight went missing in May 2016 for Trump to speculate publicly that the attack was . More than a year later, it\u2019s still not clear what happened to the plane.",
        "MOSCOW \u2014 Russia on Monday angrily condemned the downing of a Syrian aircraft by a U. S. fighter as a \u201cflagrant violation of international law,\u201d and said its forces will treat U. S. coalition aircraft and drones as targets if they are operating in Syrian airspace west of the Euphrates while Russian aviation is on combat missions.
