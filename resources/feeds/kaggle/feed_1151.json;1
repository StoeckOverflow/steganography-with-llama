        "Let\u2019s pause for a moment to consider some essential truths about the regime in North Korea. A little more than a year ago, the government there arrested a visiting American student named Otto Warmbier. The charge? He had allegedly tried to steal a propaganda poster. Even if he did commit this heinous offense, it\u2019s also likely that Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un wanted a bit of additional leverage during a moment of tension with the United States, and Warmbier made a good target. North Korea has often held Americans as hostages in the past.",
        "Little Marco has made up with Big Donald. The pliable Republican senator from Florida and the deranged president of the United States now get along. It was only a bit more than a year ago that they were hurling verbal spitballs at one another. Donald Trump called Marco Rubio \u201cLittle Marco,\u201d and Rubio called Trump a \u201ccon artist. \u201d Rubio suggested Trump had small hands and Trump responded by displaying his ones.",
        "The United States has morphed into a country of armchair \u201cplatform\u201d analysts. How dare NBC News and Megyn Kelly give conspiracy theorist and InfoWars boss Alex Jones a platform to expand his popularity on the recently launched program \u201cSunday Night with Megyn Kelly\u201d! Such was the outcry that occupied the better part of a week, during which this blog was on vacation. The backlash \u2014 or prelash, considering that the protests related to a piece of journalism that had not yet aired \u2014 had a common thread that you commonly hear from spinmeisters in this day and age.",
        "The horrific shooting targeting GOP lawmakers at an Alexandria baseball field last week was an alarming call: Public officials may be increasingly facing potentially deadly threats of violence. Although hostile messages, emails and posts are nothing new for many lawmakers, the shooting heightened awareness that verbal threats can rapidly and unpredictably turn into physical ones. In Washington, legislators from both parties are justifiably jittery. \u201cEveryone\u2019s getting a bunch of death threats right now,\u201d Rep. Ruben Gallego ( .) said last week. His Republican colleague Rep.",
        "The Atlanta reports: Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel strongly condemned an attack ad that surfaced Sunday accusing the \u201cunhinged left\u201d of endorsing violence against Republicans days before the race to represent Georgia\u2019s 6th District is decided. The ad, funded by a group called the Principled PAC, opens with sounds of gunshots and footage of U. S. Rep. Steve Scalise being wheeled away on a stretcher after he and other members of the Republican congressional baseball team were ambushed by a lone gunman while practicing in a Washington suburb.",
        "From today\u2019s opinion by Justice Samuel Alito (for four justices) in Matal v. Tam, the \u201cSlants\u201d case: [The idea that the government may restrict] speech expressing ideas that offend \u2026 strikes at the heart of the First Amendment. Speech that demeans on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, disability, or any other similar ground is hateful; but the proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express \u201cthe thought that we hate.",
        "White House press secretary Sean Spicer is expected to transition to a more role overseeing communications strategy, part of a broader overhaul of the administration\u2019s most operation that has long been the subject of President Trump\u2019s ire and criticism. Spicer\u2019s anticipated move away from the podium, confirmed by a senior White House official, comes amid weeks of Trump\u2019s frustration with his communications team, and after the White House had made overtures to a range of Republicans about taking jobs within the West Wing press operation.",
        "The first hints of an uncertain future for the Presidential Advisory Council on came last year, when Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign refused to meet with advocates for people living with HIV, said Scott Schoettes, a member of the council since 2014. That unease was magnified on Inauguration Day in January, when an official White House website for the Office of National AIDS Policy vanished, Schoettes said. \u201cI started to think, was it going to be useful or wise or would it be possible to work with this administration?\u201d Schoettes told The Washington Post.",
        "The Navy has filed criminal charges against an officer in the \u201cFat Leonard\u201d scandal, setting the stage for the first military trial in a corruption investigation that has consumed the service for the past four years, documents show.

        "The Virginia teens were up late observing Ramadan, so they did what young people often do in the wee hours of the weekend: They went out for a bite to eat at McDonald\u2019s. But as they walked and biked back to the All Dulles Area Muslim Society mosque in Sterling, along a major thoroughfare, a red car approached from behind about 3:40 a. m. Sunday and chaos erupted.",
        "The combative lawyer who made the rounds defending President Trump on the Sunday talk shows is not well known to Washington\u2019s criminal defense bar. A new member of Trump\u2019s legal team, Jay Sekulow, 61, is, however, a fixture on conservative talk radio and a celebrity among conservative organizations for his First Amendment court battles over religious rights.

Asked in an interview on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d whether he believed that carbon dioxide was \u201cthe primary control knob for the temperature of the Earth and for climate,\u201d Perry said that \u201cNo, most likely the primary control knob is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in. \u201d Perry added that \u201cthe fact is this shouldn\u2019t be a debate about, \u2018Is the climate changing, is man having an effect on it?\u2019 Yeah, we are.",

Time after time, year after year, giant herds of the animals creep to the edge of the Mara River in Kenya and start to drink, seemingly oblivious to danger. The spectacle in countless nature documentaries can bring viewers to the edge of their seats. They want to warn them. There are huge crocodiles in the river! Don\u2019t they see the danger?",
        "Last week, Melania Trump began calling Washington, D. C. home, giving the nation\u2019s capital something in common with the small, hilly Slovenian town of Sevnica. With a population of only 5, 000, the town was mostly known for its red wine and dry sausages, The Washington Post\u2019s Rick Noak reported last year. But that was before Melania became known to the world. \u201cMelania Trump put the name of our town on the map of the world,\u201d Mayor Srecko Ocvirk said last year. \u201cMelania made it from the small town of Sevnica \u2026 .",
        "CHAMBLEE, Ga. \u2014 Thousands of voters in the suburbs north of Atlanta grabbed the country\u2019s attention Tuesday as a special congressional election neared its end as a referendum on President Trump. Polls in Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District opened at 7 a. m. on a humid morning, with commuters casting ballots with iced coffees in their hands on their way to centers, office parks and downtown Atlanta.

        "The Minnesota police officer who fatally shot Philando Castile during a traffic stop last year fired a volley of bullets within seconds of learning the driver was armed, according to a video recording released publicly Tuesday. When the traffic stop began, the two men interacted calmly.

        "Words matter journalists are fond of saying. This comes lately in the context of presidential tweets that conceivably could have serious repercussions. Otherwise, we seem conflicted about how much words should matter when used in a potentially consequential way among everyday people. Political correctness, or ignorance, has caused us to discard words and expressions that some find offensive, despite the Constitution\u2019s protections for nearly every form of speech short of the \u201cfire\u201d prohibition. As a result, most people put up with objectionable \u201cart\u201d and inflammatory language in the interest of protecting the First Amendment\u2019s broader application.",
        "I am a registered liberal who mostly toes the party line, but I am not devoted to the idea of big government. I loath the law in New York state requiring gas pump nozzles to not latch. This means that I must stand beside my vehicle, holding the nozzle lever open, instead of latching it and walking into the gas station to use the john which, if you\u2019re an older male and hear gushing liquid, you feel a powerful urge to do, so thanks to legislative overregulation, I am on the verge of humiliating myself.",
        "Tim Cullen is a former Democratic majority leader of the Wisconsin Senate. Dale Schultz is a former Republican majority leader of the Wisconsin Senate. They are of the Fair Elections Project, which helped organize the Gill v. Whitford litigation. As politicians from different parties, we disagree a lot. We vote for different candidates for president, we have very different views on taxes, and we disagree strongly on abortion. But some things we agree on: We both love our home state, Wisconsin, where we have had long careers in public service, including having led our state Senate.",

        "LONDON \u2014 \u201cRegulation\u201d is a boring word with unpleasant connotations, especially in Britain. Schools, offices and governments have regulations. British students, employees and businesses seek to get around regulations. Regulations are thought to cost money, time and effort, preventing people from engaging in more productive activity. One of the most important arguments against the European Union in Britain during the Brexit referendum campaign last year was that the E. U. is widely believed to be a source of regulations.",
        "THE TOLL of gun violence on American children is laid out in the grim numbers of a new government study. Nearly 1, 300 children are killed and nearly 6, 000 injured every year. That is more than three children killed a day and more than 15 children a day treated for gunshot wounds. The heartbreaking tragedy embodied in those numbers can be seen through the prism of three days that preceded the study\u2019s release.

        "President Trump on Tuesday appeared to lose faith in China\u2019s ability to pressure North Korea, and his spokesman said the White House is \u201cmoving further away\u201d from direct engagement with Pyongyang, throwing into question the administration\u2019s strategy to contain the rogue nation\u2019s growing nuclear threat.

When he returned last week, medically evacuated from his detention in North Korea, he was in a coma, with extensive brain damage. Warmbier died Monday, surrounded by family. His funeral will be Thursday at the high school where he graduated as salutatorian in 2013.

The 2014 numbers, the latest available for every state and the District of Columbia, reflect a 64 percent increase for inpatient care and a 99 percent jump for emergency room treatment compared to figures from 2005. Their trajectory likely will keep climbing if the epidemic continues unabated. The report, released by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) puts Maryland at the very top of the national list for inpatient care.",
        "BRUSSELS \u2014 Belgian soldiers shot a man at a central Brussels train station who they think set off a small explosion Tuesday, Belgian authorities said, in an incident that they described as a terrorist attack. The apparent attack \u2014 which did not injure anyone other than the suspect \u2014 came after a series of incidents in Paris and Britain in recent weeks, setting off fears of further violence across the continent as tourism high season begins. But Belgian authorities did not raise the nation\u2019s terrorism threat level, a sign that they do not think another attack is imminent."
