        "There are certain truths that accompany summer in Phoenix: temperatures persist well past sundown. It\u2019s not considered abnormal to drive with oven mitts or ice packs in the car. And after a certain threshold, even the \u201cit\u2019s a dry heat\u201d jokes cease being funny. Usually, the hot season is met with a certain amount of disbelief by people outside of Arizona. Meanwhile, locals shrug, knowing simply to stay indoors as much as possible or escape to the cooler climes of Northern Arizona. But this week has felt different, even for seasoned .",
        "miles below the ocean near Australia, there is crushing pressure, total darkness and a collection of some of the strangest creatures on the planet \u2014 if you\u2019re willing to go find them. Scientists haven\u2019t heavily explored these areas, in part because they\u2019re places on Earth that are among the most inhospitable to humans. But recently, an international team of scientists sponsored by Museums Victoria and a government research organization spent a month trawling the ocean floor off the Aussie Coast trying to figure out what lives down there \u2014 and how they\u2019ve adapted to survive.",
        "Voters in Georgia\u2019s 6th District turned out to choose a replacement for former representative Tom Price (now secretary of health and human services) bringing the most expensive race in congressional history to a close. Polls showed a very close contest between Republican Karen Handel and Democrat Jon Ossoff. The special election represents the Democrat\u2019s best opportunity to pick up a House seat going into the 2018 general election. The charts below explain why the race is the best measure yet of Republicans\u2019 chances of keeping their House majority in 2018. Republicans control the House 241 to 194.",
        "Senate leaders on Wednesday were putting the final touches on legislation that would reshape a big piece of the U. S. system by dramatically rolling back Medicaid while easing the impact on Americans who stand to lose coverage under a new bill. A discussion draft circulating Wednesday afternoon among aides and lobbyists would roll back the ACA\u2019s taxes, phase down its Medicaid expansion, rejigger its subsidies, give states wider latitude in opting out of its regulations and eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood.",
        "Hypocrisy has always been a vital lubricant to making the gears turn in Washington. Give politicians some power and a job to get done, and they quickly forget their righteous critiques of the seamy practices they denounced when the other side was running things. Rarely, however, has the double standard been so flagrant as now, when Republicans are scrambling to keep their promise to \u201crepeal and replace Obamacare. \u201d Exhibit A: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) who is set to produce a draft of a bill to be voted on next week.",
        "CHAMBLEE, Ga. \u2014 Republicans in the conservative Atlanta suburbs and across the country were elated Wednesday after their party beat back Democrats in a competitive special election, avoiding a loss that could have damaged President Trump\u2019s hopes of enacting his agenda. But the celebration of Republican Karen Handel\u2019s victory in Georgia\u2019s Sixth congressional district may be brief. Trump\u2019s priorities remain largely stalled on Capitol Hill and Tuesday\u2019s result, due to a unique set of circumstances, provides only a faint road map to either party as they strategize for next year\u2019s midterm elections.",
        "For all the money spent and the endless analysis about the meaning of it all, the special congressional election in Georgia\u2019s 6th District produced a status quo result. Republican Karen Handel held on to a seat long held by the Republicans. For both parties, there are lessons to be learned. Any House race that generates $50 million in spending \u2014 it was the costliest in history \u2014 is hardly a generic laboratory, and therefore the results are subject to over interpretation. In the fevered atmosphere that surrounded this contest in suburban Atlanta, it\u2019s easy to lose sight of fundamentals.",

They are facing pressure to crank up the pace as the population ages and demand soars. But the giant is grappling with a steep downside of the nation\u2019s low unemployment rate: It is struggling to find enough workers, despite offering some of the region\u2019s best pay and benefits.

        "People connected to the Russian government tried to hack computer systems in 21 states, a Department of Homeland Security official testified Wednesday. Samuel Liles, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s acting director of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis Cyber Division, said vote tallying mechanisms were unaffected, and the hackers appeared to be scanning for vulnerabilities \u2014 which Liles likened to walking down the street and looking at homes to see who might be inside.

Bush and making him president. The decision was 5 to 4, with the most conservative justices in favor of Bush. Democrats condemned the ruling as nakedly partisan, saying it was based not on precedent but a legal rationale: Recount rules didn\u2019t treat all ballots the same way, thus violating the 14th Amendment guarantee of equal protection of the laws. Many critics saw Bush v.",

He had discussed dealings with an international businessman who also happened to double as a source for his journalism. It\u2019s an arrangement that would any set of journalism ethics guidelines: As the AP reports, Solomon communicated about deals with Farhad Azima, a mogul who was the subject of a recent AP investigation.

        "The proposal unveiled by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday came under immediate attack from conservative and centrist Republican senators as well as industry officials, casting the bill\u2019s viability into doubt even as GOP leaders plan to bring it to a final vote next week. The bill, which McConnell ( .) released after weeks of drafting it in secrecy, drew swift criticism from senators who argued it does not go far enough in undoing Barack Obama\u2019s signature law \u2014 the Affordable Care Act.",

        "Republicans have vowed for months to undo the Affordable Care Act and stave off the collapse of the nation s most fragile health insurance markets, which serve people who buy coverage on their own. In the Senate, that turns out to be a goal. Legislation that the Senate s GOP leaders finally disclosed on Thursday would keep billions of dollars flowing \u201d but only for two years \u201d to health plans that have been begging for continued help with the expense of millions of customers in ACA insurance marketplaces. After 2019, the payments would stop.",
        "With a small tweak to a relatively obscure part of the Republican bill, GOP senators would make deep, permanent cuts to a insurance program that covers tens of millions of Americans. The Republican bill wouldn\u2019t just unravel the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Republicans are also planning to restructure Medicaid, a program established by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 that provides health insurance to poor households, pregnant women and elderly patients. Already, the version of the bill the House passed last month included drastic reductions in Medicaid outlays of about $834 billion over 10 years.",
        "The \u201c bill\u201d that Republicans are trying to pass in the Senate, like the one approved by the GOP majority in the House, isn\u2019t really about health care at all. It\u2019s the first step in a massive redistribution of wealth from struggling to the rich \u2014 a theft of historic proportions. Is the Senate version less \u201cmean\u201d than the House bill, to use President Trump\u2019s description of that earlier effort? Not really. Does the new bill have the \u201cheart\u201d that Trump demanded? No, it doesn\u2019t. The devil is not in the details, it\u2019s in the big picture.",

The party\u2019s great hope for the Georgia seat was a $24 million man whose victory would have likely had a seismic impact on Washington\u2019s direction, rattling Republicans in Congress already nervous about the president.
