        "The words leapt from President Trump\u2019s mind to Twitter at 8:26 a. m. on the Friday after he fired FBI director James B. Comey, setting off a cascade of activity inside and outside the federal government to figure out what, exactly, he meant. \u201cJames Comey better hope that there are no \u2018tapes\u2019 of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!\u201d Trump wrote. With that tweet, Trump immediately deepened his own legal and political quagmire, evoking comparisons to President Richard M.",
        "The Army has demoted the former commander of the 1st Infantry Division for having \u201can inappropriate relationship\u201d with a junior officer, the latest in a string of episodes in which Army generals have landed in trouble for personal misconduct. Wayne W. Grigsby Jr. who also served as the commander of Fort Riley, Kan. was reprimanded and demoted from major general to brigadier general after investigators found that he had called and texted a female captain more than 850 times over 10 months and was spending time at her home, according to Army documents obtained by The Washington Post.",
        "A former CIA officer sold top secret and other classified documents to Chinese intelligence officials, according to charges filed Thursday in Alexandria federal court. Kevin Patrick Mallory, 60, of Leesburg, Va. was arrested Thursday and appeared briefly in front of Judge Theresa Buchanan on counts of delivering defense information to aid a foreign government and making false statements. He asked to be represented by a public defender. Mallory had a top secret security clearance until he left the government in 2012, prosecutors say, having worked at various government agencies and defense contractors.",
        "For the second time in four days, the White House barred television cameras from a media briefing Thursday and prohibited live audio broadcasts. Press secretary Sean Spicer also skipped the session, deploying his deputy, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, to answer questions instead. briefings are becoming a regular occurrence in the Trump White House, especially on big news days. (Senate Republicans released their plan Thursday, and the president finally said that he did not record conversations with former FBI director James B.",
        "On Wednesday night\u2019s episode of Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d Trevor Noah devoted the second half of his monologue to his devastation after seeing the video footage of the Minnesota police officer who fatally shot Philando Castile during a traffic stop last year. Last week, the officer was acquitted on all charges, including manslaughter. \u201cYesterday on the show, we spoke about the killing of Philando Castile and the verdict that exonerated the police officer who shot him.",
        "Tropical Storm Cindy may have been downgraded to a tropical depression Thursday, but that doesn\u2019t mean Gulf Coast residents are in the clear. As the storm moves inland, it\u2019s still expected to dump enough rainfall between Texas and Florida to cause severe flooding, which raises the possibility of another threat that may take some locals by surprise: floating fire ants. The notoriously tough insects are just as dangerous when they\u2019re wet as they are dry, according to Alabama officials, who are warning residents to keep their eyes peeled for floating mounds of fire ants.",
        "Rather than let nature take its course and gently glide into revered status, former president Barack Obama has launched a war on President Trump. And frankly, it could help Republican leadership in Congress just when it needs it. By becoming such a pointed and vocal critic of the GOP bill, Obama is forcing Republicans to choose whether they will vote against the bill \u2014 and save Obamacare \u2014 or evolve with Trump and fix a broken system that has only gotten worse with time. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies threaten Obama\u2019s legacy.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: The single most glaring feature of the Republican plan is how massively regressive it is. Whether in the Senate or House version, it cuts spending on poor people by hundreds of billions of dollars, to finance (relative to current law) an enormous tax cut for the rich. The regressiveness of the plan is a feature, not a bug. Even if you allow that Republicans believe in a principled way that this will benefit America, it is the plan\u2019s overriding ideological goal.",
        "Today, Greg Miller, Ellen Nakashima and Adam Entous have a blockbuster story about how the Obama administration handled the Russian effort to manipulate the 2016 presidential election, one that is both shocking and maddening. Reading it, one can\u2019t avoid the conclusion that if it had happened during a Republican administration, things would have gone very differently. What comes through again and again is that the Obama administration was terrified of looking partisan or doing anything that might seem like it was putting a thumb on the scale of the election, and the result was paralysis.",
        "Rachel Cleetus is the lead economist and climate policy manager with the Climate and Energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. Much of the Southwestern United States is reeling under a heat wave so severe that it has forced airlines to ground flights. On the Gulf Coast, millions of people were put on emergency alert ahead of Tropical Storm Cindy, which caused widespread flooding and power outages. Climate change is already affecting our economy and safety, with risks to critical infrastructure \u2014 roads, bridges, dams, water and energy infrastructure and military sites.",
        "President Trump has a new morning ritual. Around 6:30 a. m. on many days \u2014 before all the network news shows have come on the air \u2014 he gets on the phone with a member of his outside legal team to chew over all things Russia. The calls \u2014 detailed by three senior White House officials \u2014 are part strategy consultation and part presidential venting session, during which Trump\u2019s lawyers and gurus take turns reviewing the latest headlines with him.",
        "Last week, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed controversial legislation into law that allows child welfare providers \u2014 including adoption agencies \u2014 to refuse adoptions to hopeful parents based on \u201csincerely held religious beliefs. \u201d In response, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced Thursday that his state will prohibit its employees from traveling to Texas because Texas has enacted laws that, he said, discriminate against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender individuals and their families.",
        "Dennis Rodman has clung to celebrity \u2014 or at least his sketchy notion of it \u2014 for nearly two decades since his basketball career ended. \u201cAnyone with the right combination of flair, talent, drive and luck can become important in America,\u201d Rodman wrote in 1997, in the third of his four \u2014 count \u2019em, four \u2014 memoirs, \u201cWalk on The Wild Side. \u201d If importance is still what he is after, he holds a broad and naive view of it. Rodman is walking 1990s nostalgia.",
        "Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Friday that the Trump administration \u201cfully supports\u201d Texas\u2019s harsh new ban on sanctuary cities, and the Department of Justice will help defend it against a federal court challenge next week. Lawyers for the tiny border city of El Cenizo, the League of United Latin American Citizens and major cities such as Dallas and Austin say the law requiring them to detain immigrants for federal deportation agents is \u201cpatently unconstitutional\u201d for a number of reasons. On Monday, they will urge U. S.",
        "CNN sent Bill Hennessy, the network\u2019s regular Supreme Court sketch artist, to the White House briefing today. https: . pic. twitter. \u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) June 23, 2017 For the third time this week, the White House on Friday banned TV cameras from a news media briefing. Lacking footage and wanting some kind of visual element, CNN came up with a rather creative solution: a courtroom sketch artist. William J. Hennessy Jr. who has illustrated Bill Clinton impeachment proceedings and hearings over a long career in Washington, was dispatched to sketch White House press secretary Sean Spicer.",
        "More bad news for Sears Holdings: The beleaguered chain on Friday said it will shutter an additional 20 U. S. stores, amounting to more than 260 closures so far this year. The announcement, which deals yet another blow to the company, comes as retailers across the country struggle to stay relevant in an era of online shopping. Department stores such as Sears, J. C. Penney and Macy\u2019s have been particularly hard hit as Americans look beyond the suburban shopping mall for clothing, furniture and appliances.",
        "Sen. Dean Heller ( .) said Friday that he cannot support Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s bill without changes to it, becoming the fifth GOP senator to take that position since the bill was released on Thursday. Heller, who is up for reelection in 2018, has expressed concerns about the way the measure addresses the future of Medicaid. The proposal would impose federal spending cuts on the program.",
        "Melania Trump on Friday named a senior manager at Washington\u2019s Trump International Hotel to serve as chief usher of the White House. Timothy Harleth, who worked for Mandarin Oriental hotels in D. C. and New York before joining one of the Trumps\u2019 flagship hotels last year, will take the crucial position overseeing the staff of housekeepers, butlers and others who work in the first family\u2019s living quarters and maintain the executive mansion.",

        "A small group of moderate Republican senators, worried that their leaders\u2019 bill could damage the nation\u2019s social safety net, may pose at least as significant an obstacle to the measure\u2019s passage as their colleagues on the right. The vast changes the legislation would make to Medicaid, the country\u2019s broadest source of public health insurance, would represent the largest single step the government has ever taken toward conservatives\u2019 goal of reining in federal spending on entitlement programs in favor of a system.",
        "The stark divide among Republicans on reshaping the nation\u2019s health system came into full view over the past few days. Formally unveiled Thursday, the Senate Republican plan came under immediate friendly fire from within Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s GOP conference. The Kentucky Republican has just a few days to navigate the perilous path in trying to appease one bloc of holdouts without losing votes from another bloc. It sets up a final frenzy of negotiation, as McConnell has determined he will finish with the legislation one way or another by the end of this month.",
        "The loss in last week\u2019s special congressional election in Georgia produced predictable and inside the Democratic Party. It also raised anew a question that has troubled the party through a period in which they have lost ground political. Simply put: Do Democrats have a message? Right now, the one discernible message is opposition to President Trump. That might be enough to get through next year\u2019s midterm elections, though some savvy Democratic elected officials doubt it. What\u2019s needed is a message that attracts voters beyond the base of the party.",
        "President Trump and former House speaker Newt Gingrich have both now admitted, for all intents and purposes, that Trump\u2019s ruse about possible White House tapes was meant to influence James B. Comey\u2019s public comments. In an interview Friday with Fox News, Trump congratulated himself for the ploy. \u201cWho knows, I think his story may have changed,\u201d Trump said. Asked whether his strategy was smart, Trump said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t very stupid; I can tell you that.",
        "It started so innocently. A kid ordered a soda in a restaurant. \u201cIt came with a plastic straw in it,\u201d Milo Cress recalled. He glared at the straw for a while. \u201cIt seemed like such a waste. \u201d Not only did Cress yank the plastic from his drink, but he also launched a campaign, \u201cBe Straw Free,\u201d targeting all straws as needless pollution. He knocked on the doors of restaurants in Burlington, Vt. where he lived at the time, and asked managers not to offer straws unless patrons asked. He was 9 years old.",
        "Someone was trying to kill him. William C. Morva was certain of it. He couldn\u2019t breathe and he was withering away, he told his mother in a jailhouse call. \u201cSomebody wants me to die and I don\u2019t know who it is,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know my health is dwindling, okay?\u201d He sounded paranoid. His voice grew more frantic with each call over several months on the recorded lines.",
        "THE PURPOSE OF tax reform is to raise revenue more efficiently \u2014 with fewer loopholes and special breaks that distort economic incentives and necessitate higher marginal rates. In discussing tax reform since President Trump\u2019s election, Republicans have promised to do just that: pass a bill with lower rates for both individuals and businesses, applied to an income \u201cbase\u201d broadened by the elimination of deductions and credits. If you listen very closely to what GOP leaders have been saying lately, however, especially in remarks last week by House Speaker Paul D.",
        "Every time President Trump tweets, journalists and Twitter followers attempt to analyze what he means. Intelligence agencies around the world do, too: They\u2019re trying to determine what vulnerabilities the president of the United States may have. And he\u2019s giving them a lot to work with. Trump\u2019s Twitter feed is a gold mine for every foreign intelligence agency. Usually, intelligence officers\u2019 efforts to collect information on world leaders are methodical, painstaking and often covert. CIA operatives have risked their lives to learn about foreign leaders so the United States could devise strategies to counter our adversaries.",
        "SEOUL South Korea\u2019s new president, Moon belongs to a progressive party that has been out of power for nearly 10 years. His formative political experience was working for another president, Roh whose government believed in cooperating with, rather than battling, North Korea \u2014 a policy on which Moon also campaigned. But North Korea seems eager to test the Western alliance since President Trump took office. In that time, the North has fired new missiles that experts say could ultimately reach San Francisco.",
        "HONG KONG In June 1995, two years before this longtime British colony and its 6 million crown subjects were due to be handed over to communist China, Fortune Magazine printed a famously controversial \u2014 and widely panned \u2014 cover story titled \u201cThe Death of Hong Kong. \u201d It predicted that once Hong Kong became infected with China\u2019s culture of corruption and patronage, this glittering international finance hub would become just another typical mainland city. \u201cIn fact,\u201d the article declared, \u201cthe naked truth about Hong Kong\u2019s future can be summed up in two words: It\u2019s over.",
        "At age 15, I suddenly felt an unquenchable thirst and began urinating frequently. I lost 20 pounds. I had developed Type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease that destroyed my body\u2019s ability to produce insulin. Without insulin, I would have eventually developed a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis, which is lethal without (and even sometimes with) treatment. Years later, I\u2019m a practicing endocrinologist. I could never have imagined back when I first started taking insulin that one day I would have so many patients who could not afford the medication because of skyrocketing prices."
