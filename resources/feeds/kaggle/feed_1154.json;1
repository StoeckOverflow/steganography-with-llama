        "This spring, political officials at the Environmental Protection Agency removed the agency\u2019s climate change website, one of the world\u2019s top resources for information on the science and effects of climate change. To me, a scientist who managed this website for more than five years, its removal signifies a declaration of war on climate science by EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. There can be no other interpretation. I draw this conclusion as a meteorologist with a specialization in climate science and as an independent voter who strives to keep my political and scientific views separate.",

The surprising thing about this bill is not that it forsakes the indigent, elderly and vulnerable. It\u2019s that it forsakes so many of the Republicans\u2019 own vaunted values.
