        "The Pentagon is considering a plan to cancel enlistment contracts for 1, 000 recruits without legal immigration status, knowingly exposing them to deportation, a Defense Department memo shows. The undated action memo, prepared for Defense Secretary Jim Mattis by personnel and intelligence officials at the Pentagon and obtained by The Washington Post, describes potential security threats of immigrants recruited in a program designed to award citizenship in exchange for urgently needed medical and language skills.",
        "Fifty California residents have filed a petition to recall the California judge who drew national criticism for issuing a short jail sentence to Brock Turner, the former Stanford swimmer convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman on campus. The effort to recall Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky \u201d the first official move to get him off the bench since Turner s sentencing in June 2016 \u201d has garnered endorsements from members of Congress, national women s rights organizations and leaders in Silicon Valley.",

        "Their original plan was to work at Six Flags. The girls they\u2019d meet. The fun they\u2019d have. Free admission to the amusement park on days off. Perfect, right? \u201cIt was the total package,\u201d said Nolan White, 17. Except Nolan and his friends didn\u2019t get the jobs. Too much competition. \u201cSo they tried something else,\u201d said Raymond Bell, who understood the spirit of the boys\u2019 plan and has his own plans for them. But we\u2019ll get to that later.",
        "Since the human genome was first sequenced in 2003, the immense promise of a technology that can reveal the 6 billion letters that make each of us who we are has loomed large as a way to revolutionize nearly every aspect of human health, from what we know about ourselves the day we are born to how to stave off the day that we die. But the ability to peer into the most fundamental biology of a human being has raised a slew of ethical questions and one that is even more simple: when is that information useful?",
        "LONDON \u2014 Britain on Monday confronted a rapidly growing crisis after tests of the exterior cladding on dozens of towers revealed a 100 percent failure rate, raising fears that this month\u2019s deadly inferno in London could be replicated elsewhere. Out of 75 buildings tested since last week, Communities Secretary Sajid Javid told Parliament late Monday afternoon, not one passed. That\u2019s up from 60 failures out of 60 on Sunday \u2014 with hundreds more towers yet to be examined.",
        "The last day of seventh grade ended at 11:56 a. m. and by 1 p. m. Paola Giron and her friends were at the mall, heading into Claire\u2019s. \u201cWe come here all the time,\u201d said Giron, 13, wearing a that read \u201cI woke up like this. \u201d But after 20 minutes of searching, the group emerged with just one purchase among the five of them: an eyeshadow palette that cost $3. 99. The who had already shopped at Forever 21 at the Fashion Centre at Pentagon City, were rationing their limited funds.",
        "The story is sketchy and the details are entirely dependent on whom you choose to believe, but at some point in 2006, Jesse Ventura and \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d Chris Kyle got into a brawl at a Navy SEAL bar in California. Tables were thrown. Someone ended up on the floor, possibly with a black eye. The fight lasted just a few moments, but the battle over what happened won\u2019t go away. A $1. 8 million defamation lawsuit that was won by Ventura then overturned hasn\u2019t squashed it. Neither has Kyle\u2019s death.",
        "When Seattle officials voted three years ago to incrementally boost the city\u2019s minimum wage up to $15 an hour, they\u2019d hoped to improve the lives of workers. Yet according to a major new study that could force economists to reassess past research on the issue, the hike has had the opposite effect. The city is gradually increasing the hourly minimum to $15 over several years. Already, though, some employers have not been able to afford the increased minimums. They\u2019ve cut their payrolls, putting off new hiring, reducing hours or letting their workers go, the study found.",
        "Issa Moody, 46, of Detroit, fixes his kaffiyeh outside the Rafha Islamic Center before a Ramadan dinner in 2016. (Salwan The Washington Post) After midnight on a recent Michigan summer night, the streets were alive with activity. Not for a Detroit Redwings game or a music festival but for a large Muslim American community there celebrating Ramadan. After fasting, Muslims around the world celebrate the holy month. Dearborn, Mich. with one of the largest populations of Arab Americans in the United States, is especially lively during Ramadan.",
        "For Republicans, Obamacare was always the great unifier. In a fractious party, everyone agreed that the Affordable Care Act was the wrong solution to what ailed the nation\u2019s system, with too much government and too little freedom for consumers. Replacing Obamacare has become the party\u2019s albatross, a sprawling objective still in search of a solution. The effort to make good on a promise has cost the Trump administration precious months of its first year in office, with tax restructuring backed up somewhere in the legislative pipeline, infrastructure idling somewhere no one can see it and budget deadlines looming.",
        "Senate Republican leaders bowed to pressure from within their own ranks Tuesday and postponed a vote to overhaul the Affordable Care Act until after the Fourth of July recess, raising new doubts about their ability to fulfill one of the GOP\u2019s core promises. The delay, which exposes lawmakers to a barrage of lobbying as they face their constituents over the holiday, has left a measure designed to pass swiftly this week teetering in the balance.",
        "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) has occasionally remarked that he has an unusual relationship with President Trump: Unlike most congressional leaders, he has managed to escape Trump\u2019s wrath. \u201cHe\u2019s never, as far as I can tell, gotten angry at me \u2014 in my presence, anyway,\u201d McConnell said last month. That fragile peace between a taciturn insider and a brash newcomer, which has helped both men pursue Republican priorities, faced a fresh and consequential test this week, when a major rewrite of the nation\u2019s legislation faltered in the Senate.",
        "President Trump\u2019s personal attorney Jay Sekulow was on his weekday radio show earlier this month, defending the president vociferously, when he took a pause to highlight a charity that has brought Sekulow and his family millions of dollars. \u201cLet me take off the hat of the president\u2019s lawyer and put on the ACLJ hat,\u201d he said, using the acronym for the American Center for Law and Justice. His June 16 program then cut to a plea for donations from audience members listening on 850 stations nationwide.",
        "If there\u2019s anything that typifies the boom times before the Great Recession, it is the McMansion. These sprawling houses proliferated around the country in the 2000s, as banks shelled out easy credit to fuel a housing bacchanalia they thought would never die. McMansions became the ultimate symbol of living beyond one\u2019s means. Unlike your standard mansion, McMansions aren\u2019t just large \u2014 they are tackily so. Looming over lots, these houses are often decked out with ersatz details, like chandeliers and columns. While their features mean they can command a decent price, many of these houses are shoddily built.",
        "This article has been updated. The framed copy of Time magazine was hung up in at least five of President Trump\u2019s clubs, from South Florida to Scotland. Filling the entire cover was a photo of Donald Trump. \u201cDonald Trump: The \u2018Apprentice\u2019 is a television smash!\u201d the big headline said. Above the Time nameplate, there was another headline in all caps: \u201cTRUMP IS HITTING ON ALL FRONTS . . . EVEN TV!\u201d This cover \u2014 dated March 1, 2009 \u2014 looks like an impressive memento from Trump\u2019s career.",
        "In recent days, media outlets and pundits have been escalating their attacks on the press, finding ever more creative ways to build on President Trump\u2019s tirades against \u201cfake news. \u201d The intensification of hostilities against the media is elevating Trump\u2019s attempt to undermine public faith in a free press to a new, and often nonsensical, level. It\u2019s also taking these attacks into increasingly dangerous territory. While these new assaults have a quality to them, it would be foolish to dismiss their importance.",
        "The iceberg approaches for the Senate GOP\u2019s ship, but unlike with the Titanic, there is plenty of time to turn. Republicans slowed the engines and thus the speed by postponing a vote until after the July 4 recess, but they are still set to collide with the consequences of breaking a core promise to the voters who sent them to Washington. If the GOP does not disengage the country\u2019s system from the disaster of Obamacare, we are headed for the misery of . This is the last chance to divert that outcome. Sens.",
        "Douglas is president of the American Action Forum and former director of the Congressional Budget Office. The Senate Republicans\u2019 reform \u2014 officially the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017 and better known as Obamacare \u2014 is now the center of public debate. Much of the discussion has focused on issues of timing \u2014 the \u201csecretive\u201d process by which the bill was developed, the putative \u201cjamming\u201d of the bill forward for a floor vote and now a delay of the vote until after the July 4 recess.

        "ERBIL, Iraq Here in the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, the mood is \u201cKurdistan first\u201d with the announcement of a referendum on independence in September. In neighboring Saudi Arabia, it\u2019s \u201cSaudi first,\u201d as a brash young crown prince steers the kingdom toward a more assertive role in the region. In Moscow, where I visited a few weeks ago, it\u2019s \u201cRussia first,\u201d with a vengeance. And so it goes, around most of the world. The politics of national is on steroids these days. For global leaders, it\u2019s the \u201cme\u201d moment.",
        "Don Beyer, a Democrat, represents Virginia\u2019s 8th District in the House. Democracy is in crisis. Even as the country is deeply divided along class and ideological lines, it seems to be unified in its frustration with our current brand of politics. Polls show that less than 20 percent of the country approves of the way Congress is doing its job. The time has come to consider a transformative idea that reflects the American electorate\u2019s desire for moderation and fairness and that encourages the reemergence of bridge builders and candidates with an eye for compromise.",
        "AS A candidate for the White House, Donald Trump blasted the Ford Motor Company for planning to shift production of its leading compact car, the Focus, to Mexico. He even went so far as to threaten a huge tariff on any and all U. S. cars formerly produced in this country that might be exported from Mexico back into the United States. After Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Ford seemed to cave by announcing it would not be building the cars in Mexico after all.",
        "A consulting firm led by Paul Manafort, who chaired Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign for several months last year, retroactively filed forms Tuesday showing that his firm received $17. 1 million over two years from a political party that dominated Ukraine before its leader fled to Russia in 2014. Manafort disclosed the total payments his firm received between 2012 and 2014 in a Foreign Agents Registration Act filing late Tuesday that was submitted to the U. S. Justice Department. The report makes Manafort the second former senior Trump adviser to acknowledge the need to disclose work for foreign interests.",
        "Three current or former police officers in Chicago were indicted Tuesday on charges of conspiring to cover up the fatal shooting of Laquan McDonald, a black teenager killed by an officer in 2014. McDonald\u2019s death, captured in a video released the following year that shows him being shot while moving away from officers, set off protests and continues to reverberate through the Chicago police department. The officer who opened fire was charged with murder, while investigators have also focused on the behavior of other officers following the shooting.",
        "MOSCOW \u2014 A new wave of powerful cyberattacks hit Europe on Tuesday in a possible reprise of a widespread ransomware assault in May that affected 150 countries, as Ukraine reported ransom demands targeting the government and key infrastructure, and the Danish Maersk conglomerate said many of its systems were down. Reports of attacks spread quickly on Tuesday afternoon. The Russian oil giant Rosneft and a subsidiary, Bashneft, were also hit, as was the British advertising and marketing multinational WPP.",
        "Serena Williams is pregnant. In case anyone hadn\u2019t heard the news, or missed the breathless tale of how Williams won the Australian Open during the early weeks of her pregnancy, the fact is made plain on the August cover of Vanity Fair which features the tennis champion in the buff. One hand cups her breasts and the other is positioned in the small of her back. The body posture suggests confidence, but it also captures a hint of nonchalant impatience. Come on, take the picture!",
        "DOHA, Qatar \u2014 The preacher at the center of Qatar\u2019s diplomatic crisis is a who wears spectacles and no longer stands to give sermons. Yet, to Qatar\u2019s Arab neighbors, Yusuf is a uniquely dangerous man. The cleric and TV star has never been charged in a terrorist attack, but he was labeled a terrorist this month in a formal declaration by Saudi Arabia and three of its allies. Since then, Persian Gulf states have banned Qaradawi\u2019s books, blocked his broadcasts and even sought to remove his name from public buildings.",
        "The of a dockside Baltimore restaurant has revealed that nearly his entire kitchen staff resigned after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent demanded their papers in the latest example of the national debate over immigration. In an open letter to his customers Saturday, BoatHouse Canton owner Gene Singleton blamed the Trump administration \u201cfor targeting the Hispanic community. \u201d He has since been alternately condemned or praised for defending his workers regardless of their legal status.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 Martin Shkreli got his first taste of Wall Street as an intern for a hedge fund firm started by CNBC personality Jim Cramer. After striking out on his own, he developed a reputation for aggressive tactics, including betting a company\u2019s stock price would fall and then berating its executives on social media. His battles earned him a spot on Forbes\u2019 list of \u201c30 under 30\u201d after Shkreli torpedoed a industry merger and \u201cantagonized\u201d pharmaceutical giant Pfizer into removing its former chief executive from the company\u2019s board of directors, the magazine said.",
        "It might seem logical that the states with the highest prevalence of overweight people would have the highest percentages of hefty pets. Surely all those fit Coloradans with their outdoorsy lifestyles have slim dogs, right? Not according to a new report based on the physiques of more than 2. 5 million dogs and 500, 000 cats in the United States."
