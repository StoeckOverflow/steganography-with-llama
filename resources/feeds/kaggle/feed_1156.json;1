        "President Trump has a major staffing problem. He has been president for five months, and yet his agencies are severely understaffed at the highest levels. And, no, it\u2019s not all Senate Democrats\u2019 fault. In the State Department, the Senate has confirmed only of positions that President Barack Obama had at the same point in his presidency. And that\u2019s not because, as Trump claims, Senate Democrats are blocking his nominees. (Democrats can committee hearings, but they can\u2019t actually block votes.) Trump is way behind other recent presidents in nominating people for the Senate to vote on.",
        "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is aiming to send a revised version of his bill to the Congressional Budget Office as soon as Friday as he continues to push for a vote before Congress\u2019s August recess. The effort reflects the tight timeline McConnell faces in his attempt to hold a vote in July \u2014 and the pressure he is under to make changes to the bill that will garner enough support to pass.",
        "We\u2019ve just seen three new polls on the Senate GOP\u2019s bill, and each of them paints an increasingly dire picture for Republicans. Support for the bill is languishing between just 1 out of every 8 Americans and 1 out of every 6 Americans, according to polls from the Marist (17 percent) USA University (12 percent) and Quinnipiac University (16 percent). In each case, a majority opposes the bill. That\u2019s a level of popularity so low that it\u2019s difficult to believe the bill is being entertained. It\u2019s all a pretty stunning indictment of the GOP\u2019s failure to sell the bill.",
        "In Virginia, Republican gubernatorial nominee Ed Gillespie is getting peppered with questions on the campaign trail about President Trump\u2019s efforts on health care, and he has declined to take a clear position. In Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan (R) who is up for reelection next year, says plans being advanced by the Republican Congress \u201cdo not work\u201d for his state, but he is still getting badgered by Democrats to speak out more forcefully against Trump. And in Illinois, Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) is taking flak for saying he still needs time to study the GOP bills.",
        "\u201cImportant note for tomorrow: if GOP repeal bill ends essential benefits protection, it also ends preexisting conditions protection. \u201d \u2014 Sen. Chris Murphy ( .) post on Twitter, June 21, 2017 \u201cThe bill\u2019s defenders will say it repeals Obamacare\u2019s taxes and reduces Medicaid spending growth. That\u2019s true. But it also boosts spending on subsidies, and it leaves in place the rules that drive up the cost of insurance for everyone. \u201d \u2014 Sen.",
        "On Tuesday, the fate of the Republicans\u2019 attempt to undo the Affordable Care Act dominated news out of Washington. Phones rattled with alerts about the decision to delay a vote until . Camera crews jostled for shots of senators meeting with President Trump, then boarding a bus that took them past jeering protesters. A viewer tuning into Fox News that night hardly saw any of it. The network\u2019s shows, ratings kings of cable news, ignored the story. Fox\u2019s 8 p. m. and 10 p. m.",
        "\u201cBaby Driver\u201d begins with a bang, a showstopper of an opening number reminiscent of the ecstatic traffic jam in \u201cLa La Land,\u201d only this time with the cars themselves as the dancers. While his rob a bank, a young wheelman waits outside, playing air violin to \u201cBellbottoms\u201d by the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion.

        "Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was supposed to attend this week\u2019s Economic Council of the Christian Democratic Union meeting in Berlin, but suddenly canceled his travel plans on Tuesday. Ross was scheduled to give an address at the conference immediately before German Chancellor Angela Merkel, so he instead gave his remarks by teleconference from Washington. Ross was allotted 10 minutes to speak. After he spoke for more than 20, the conference organizers cut his feed . The audience \u201claughed and clapped\u201d in response, according to Bloomberg News. Merkel then rose and, during her remarks, disagreed with one of Ross\u2019s points.",
        "The Pentagon is putting the final touches on a promised new State strategy for Syria and Iraq, and it looks very much like the one the Obama administration pursued, according to senior defense officials. The core of the strategy is to deny territory to the militants and ultimately defeat them, and to stay out of Syria\u2019s civil war pitting the Syrian government of President Bashar Iran and Russia against domestic opposition forces. The two fights in that country have come into increasingly close proximity in recent months, and there have been clashes.",
        "In its current iteration, the Republican Party truly seems to believe that the solution to every problem involves throwing more money at rich people. This explains the fiasco in the Senate, and it\u2019s why President Trump and Congress have yet to address a single major problem the country faces. Everything is secondary to the GOP\u2019s two opening legislative priorities: gutting Obamacare and passing a tax cut. The president has talked a lot about infrastructure, but he has offered no plan and Congress shows few signs of coming up with one anytime soon.",
        "Evan McMullin is a former CIA operations officer who ran as an independent candidate in the 2016 presidential election. He is of the nonprofit Stand Up Republic. Whether its leaders and members realize it, the Republican Party is at risk of becoming the Vladi mir party in the United States. It can be convincingly argued that it\u2019s already similar to parties in Europe, given Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, the Republican base\u2019s increasingly favorable views of Moscow and the House GOP leadership\u2019s disinterest in investigating and preventing Russian interference.",
        "There\u2019s bad news from Seattle for advocates of a $ minimum wage law. Turns out the measure\u2019s costs to the city\u2019s workers have outweighed benefits by 3 to 1, according to a new study by University of Washington researchers. The average worker has lost $125 a month because of the decree, the study found \u2014 even before it is fully phased in. David Autor, a leading labor economist at MIT, told The Post the study seemed \u201cvery credible\u201d and suggested that it might have enough \u201cstatistical power\u201d to \u201cchange minds\u201d in the perennial argument over the minimum wage.",
        "Charles Blahous holds the J. Fish and Lillian F. Smith Chair at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Over the past several days, Americans have been told that the sponsors of pending health legislation are moving to victimize the most vulnerable people in our society, indifferent to potentially lethal consequences. A recent New York Times from three experts described the effort as a \u201cdirect attack on our elderly, our disabled and our dignity.",
        "Nilanjana Bhowmick is a journalist and writer in India. NEW DELHI \u2014 On June 23, three days before India celebrated Eid, Junaid Khan was stabbed to death by a group of men aboard a train. He was going home to Khandawli, a village in the north Indian state of Haryana, after shopping for new clothes in New Delhi, accompanied by his brother and a couple of friends.

        "REPUBLICAN SENATORS are regrouping after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) put off a vote on his Obamacare bill. The stumble was for the better. The bill was drafted in secret. Not a single hearing was held. Democrats were not consulted. With only a single week afforded to absorb the legislation\u2019s contents before a vote, the timetable was absurd. Mr. McConnell\u2019s attempt to jam it through stank of legislative malpractice and hypocrisy.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 Martin Shkreli is odd, his attorney told a federal court on Wednesday. The former manager\u2019s investors and colleagues made fun of him behind his back and wondered whether he was autistic. Some questioned his sexuality, the jury was told. \u201cIs he strange? Yes. Will you find him weird? Yes,\u201d said Shkreli attorney Benjamin Brafman. \u201cBut [his investors] used his genius and made millions. . . . Despite his flaws and dysfunctional personality, Martin Shkreli is brilliant beyond words.",
        "The only Democrat to win a special congressional election this year still hasn\u2019t shown up for work more than three weeks after winning his race \u2014 and more than six months after the seat became vacant. Rep. Jimmy Gomez ( .) won a special election June 6 to represent California\u2019s 34th Congressional District but says he wants to serve a bit longer as a California state lawmaker. That means he will miss votes this week in Washington that would have an outsize impact on his predominantly Latino and Asian constituents.",
        "U. S. officials on Wednesday announced enhanced security and screening measures for all commercial flights to the United States but backed away from a proposal to expand a ban on laptops and other electronic devices \u2014 unless airlines and airports refuse to comply with the new rules. Since March, passengers on flights to the United States from certain primarily countries have been prohibited from bringing electronic devices larger than a cellphone on board with them.

        "Fox News has a new face: Rep. Jason Chaffetz will join the network as a contributor, Fox announced Wednesday. The Utah Republican had announced that he was resigning from Congress to pursue other opportunities, which was code for making more money (as opposed to \u201cspending more time with his family,\u201d which is code for an impending scandal).

        "Republican negotiations over how to overhaul the Affordable Care Act centered sharply Thursday on a divisive and ideological question: How much money should the Senate bill spend on protecting vulnerable Americans, and how much on providing tax relief to the wealthy? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) in an effort to strike a balance between centrists and conservatives, is now making concessions to both factions of his caucus, according to lawmakers and aides.",
        "In asking the Congressional Budget Office to take a longer view of Senate Republicans\u2019 troubled plan, the chamber\u2019s Democrats maneuvered to train a spotlight on exactly what the GOP has sought to bury. The Better Care Reconciliation Act relies on the political strategy of pressing a bill\u2019s most profound effects years into the future \u2014 in this case, in severely constricting the main source of public health insurance for poor and vulnerable Americans. Until Thursday, that scenario had been cloaked in arcane legislative language about caps and varying inflation adjustments.",
        "They came to the Senate together amid less fanfare than some of their 2010 classmates, with lower profiles that didn\u2019t lead to presidential bids. But Sens. Rob Portman (Ohio) and Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.) were intellectual forces inside the Republican caucus from the moment they took the oath in January 2011.

        "President Trump lashed out at the hosts of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d in two vicious tweets Thursday morning, calling Mika Brzezinski \u201clow I. Q.

He seemed to accord it status to its direct and competitor, \u201cFox & Friends.",
