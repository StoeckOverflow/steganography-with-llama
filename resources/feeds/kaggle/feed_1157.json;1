        "The chair of President Trump\u2019s Election Integrity Commission has penned a letter to all 50 states requesting their full data, including the name, address, date of birth, party affiliation, last four Social Security number digits and voting history back to 2006 of potentially every voter in the state. In the letter, a copy of which was made public by the Connecticut secretary of state, the commission head Kris Kobach said that \u201cany documents that are submitted to the full Commission will also be made available to the public.",
        "AFTER HIS latest execrable tweets, it\u2019s obvious that there is no point in urging President Trump to act with greater dignity, respect for his office or, for that matter, . It isn\u2019t going to happen. That makes it all the more urgent for the rest of us to think about how to safeguard civility and democratic values until his presidency ends. It would be wrong to say that Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough Thursday were shocking, because his boorishness no longer can shock. But the hateful insults directed at the MSNBC (and, in Mr.",
        "The Post reports: Visitors from six predominantly Muslim nations will be denied visas to the United States under new guidelines that take effect Thursday night unless they can prove very close family ties to someone already in the country or an institution such as a workplace or university. The rules sent to diplomatic posts worldwide Wednesday prompted immediate criticism for the narrow and somewhat quirky definition of close family. A or a can get in, but a grandmother or uncle cannot.",
        "\u201cSome of the Fake News Media likes to say that I am not totally engaged in healthcare,\u201d President Trump tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cWrong, I know the subject well & want victory for U. S. \u201d Fine, Mr. President, there\u2019s an easy way to prove your asserted knowledge: Have a news conference. Answer questions that aren\u2019t softballs tossed by your friends at Fox News. In the age of Trump, some of the president\u2019s deviations from democratic and political norms slap you in the face. Attacks on federal judges for decisions that don\u2019t go his way.",
        "Irwin Redlener is president emeritus of Children\u2019s Health Fund and a professor of health policy and management at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health. In a Post commentary this week, Medicaid administrator Seema Verma espoused a troubling philosophy about the program she oversees. She spoke of transforming Medicaid under the Republican plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Taking a fiscal sledgehammer to the program is more like it. The proposal to restructure Medicaid from the Trump administration and congressional Republicans would destabilize an already fragile situation for America\u2019s poor.",

Murphy Oil USA, Inc. before the Supreme Court. \u201cI am your voice\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s what Donald Trump promised American workers at the Republican National Convention last July. Yet this month, the Trump administration took an unprecedented step toward quelling the voices of workers. In an extraordinary the solicitor general\u2019s office informed the Supreme Court that the United States had switched sides \u2014 from affirming employee rights to defending employer authority \u2014 in three pending cases.",
        "People suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s often experience something called \u201csundowning,\u201d when in the early evening they become particularly disoriented and erratic in their behavior. The president of the United States experiences something we might call \u201cmornraging,\u201d when at the beginning of the day he tunes in to morning television shows, hears something that makes him mad and fires off tweets that highlight the darkest recesses of his id.",
        "The House on Thursday passed two immigration bills that would penalize illegal immigrants who commit crimes and local jurisdictions that refuse to work with federal authorities to deport them. Both bills, Kate\u2019s Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, passed on largely votes amid heavy promotion from Republicans, starting with President Trump. \u201cMAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!\u201d Trump tweeted as the House debated the bills Thursday, one of five tweets he pushed out to his 35 million followers highlighting the legislation.",
        "Deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was dispatched Thursday to defend President Trump\u2019s tweets about MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski that have earned almost universal condemnation, even from Republicans. In doing so, she made a whopper of a claim. When a reporter at Thursday\u2019s news briefing noted that just two weeks ago, after the shooting at a Republican congressional baseball practice, the political world talked of cooling the rhetoric to avoid such violence, Sanders was quick to respond: \u201dThe president in no way, form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence.",
        "A city in southwest Iran posted the country\u2019s hottest temperature ever recorded Thursday afternoon, and may have tied the world record for the most extreme high temperature. Etienne Kapikian, a forecaster at French meteorological agency MeteoFrance, posted to Twitter that the city of Ahvaz soared to \u201c53. 7\u00b0C\u201d (128. 7 degrees Fahrenheit). Kapikian said the temperature is a \u201cnew absolute national record of reliable Iranian heat\u201d and that it was the hottest temperature ever recorded in June over mainland Asia. Iran\u2019s previous hottest temperature was 127. 4.",
        "The fight began nearly 25 years ago, an epic legal tussle over a single word: Redskins. But on Thursday, after protests outside NFL stadiums, vows by sports journalists never to use the word and even former president Barack Obama urging team owner Daniel Snyder to change the name, the battle petered out. On Thursday, the five Native Americans fighting the NFL team over its trademark registrations called it quits in federal appeals court. So did the Justice Department, which on Wednesday declared the team the winner. The Native Americans and the Justice Department didn\u2019t have much of a choice.",
        "Researchers have long warned that unmitigated climate change could cause severe financial hardship to the United States in coming decades. But a new study published Thursday in the journal Science details how global warming could disproportionately affect poor areas of the country, contributing to widening economic inequality among Americans. \u201cThe poor regions will get poorer and the richer regions will benefit,\u201d said study Solomon Hsiang, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley.",
        "Two studies published Thursday suggest that common pesticides may harm bee colonies. In some cases, the pesticides contribute to the loss of not only worker bees but also queens. The studies, in the journal Science, have been eagerly anticipated because of concerns about the effect of neonicotinoid pesticides on pollinators, but the results were not as as experts had hoped. The question is not whether neonicotinoids can be toxic to bees. These chemicals are marketed for their power, and bees are, after all, insects.",
        "The dispute within the Republican Party over health care widened further Friday as President Trump joined with two conservative senators in calling for an outright repeal of the Affordable Care Act if the party fails to agree on an alternative plan by the end of the July Fourth recess. The reemergence of what has for much of the year been a fringe idea within the GOP revealed not only the party\u2019s philosophical divide over how to revise Obamacare but also senators\u2019 growing anxiety that they are now headed home to see their constituents with little to show them. Sen.",
        "President Trump floated a new idea on Friday morning: What if the Senate votes to repeal Obamacare today and then works to replace it later? If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 30, 2017 The idea is apparently coming from Sen. Rand Paul ( .) who called it a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d while detailing it Thursday. \u201cWhat about dividing the bill in two?",
        "President Trump\u2019s voting commission stumbled into public view this week, issuing a sweeping request for nationwide voter data that drew sharp condemnation from election experts and resistance from at least 24 states that said they cannot or will not hand over all of the data. The immediate backlash marked the first significant attention to the \u201cPresidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity\u201d since Trump started it last month and followed through on a vow to pursue his own unsubstantiated claims that voter fraud is rampant and cost him the popular vote in the presidential election.",
        "From pursuing voter fraud in the George W. Bush Justice Department to policing polling places on the Fairfax County Electoral Board, Hans von Spakovsky has been a national lightning rod on the issue of voter integrity. Now that President Trump has named the Virginia lawyer to the new Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, the man the New Yorker magazine called the source of \u201cthe myth\u201d has perhaps his greatest chance to influence Americans\u2019 access to the polls.",
        "President Trump on Thursday appointed a divisive conservative voting rights expert to spearhead the White House\u2019s search into allegations of widespread fraud in the 2016 presidential election. The appointment of Hans von Spakovsky has reignited debate over the legitimacy of claims that include unsubstantiated accusations from Trump that \u201cmillions of people\u201d voted illegally for Hillary Clinton. Von Spakovsky, a former Justice Department official, sparked legal battles over voting laws during the George W. Bush administration. Von Spakovsky, 58, will join the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, though it remains unclear what role he will take.",

Kobach recently sent letters to all 50 states asking them to provide the commission with their entire voter files. The request specifically spelled out sensitive pieces of information the commission wants to obtain, including voters names, party affiliations, military status and the last four digits of voters\u2019 Social Security numbers. As secretary of state, Kobach is tasked with supplying Kansas\u2019s data to the Trump commission.",
        "To President Trump, no place is more comfortable than the middle of a fight. This week had it all: Vicious tweets, nasty nicknames, an entrenched foe in the mainstream media and the reprisal by Trump of one of his favorite roles \u2014 the victim. Sure, Trump\u2019s push stalled on Capitol Hill, his \u201cenergy week\u201d went largely unnoticed and the president faced almost universal condemnation for an unpresidential attack on MSNBC anchor Mika Brzezinski.",
        "The morning after being viciously attacked by President Trump on Twitter, MSNBC Mika Brzezinski said she wasn\u2019t exactly reeling as a result of the president\u2019s vulgar and deeply personal assault. But on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Friday, Brzezinski said she is worried about what Trump\u2019s tweets seem to reveal about him. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said. \u201cMy family brought me up really tough. This is absolutely nothing for me personally. But I am very concerned about what this once again reveals about the president of the United States.

        "Adam Brandon is the president of FreedomWorks. The \u201cswamp\u201d is winning. Republicans are now breaking frequent promises to repeal Obamacare. Last week, the Senate Budget Committee rolled out the Better Care Reconciliation Act, the upper chamber\u2019s version of Obamacare repeal. Except the bill only modifies Obamacare subsidies, bails out insurance companies, likely keeps Medicaid expansion and does nothing to lower premiums. For more than seven years, Republicans ran on promises to repeal Obamacare.",
        "President Trump launched personal attacks against us Thursday, but our concerns about his unmoored behavior go far beyond the personal. America\u2019s leaders and allies are asking themselves yet again whether this man is fit to be president. We have our doubts, but we are both certain that the man is not mentally equipped to continue watching our show, \u201cMorning Joe. \u201d The president\u2019s unhealthy obsession with our show has been in the public record for months, and we are seldom surprised by his posting nasty tweets about us.",
        "I used to get angry before breakfast. You could even say I made a living at it. But Thursday morning, I blinked awake to the blue light of my iPhone, saw the president of the United States tweeting (again) disgusting things (again) about a woman who criticized him (again) and I felt \u2026 absolutely nothing. Summary outrage followed, declarations that this time he had gone too far. I felt a listless deja vu. Why should anything be different now? This was at least the second time Trump had insulted a female broadcaster with dual accusations of inadequacy and bloodletting.",
        "I stand with my colleagues in Congress to say: The president\u2019s tweet is beneath the dignity of the office. This is not making America great. The president has at last done the unthinkable: He has insulted a morning television personality in crude and ghastly terms and I must \u2014 in consequence of this hideous and vile breach of the dignity of the office \u2014 withdraw none of my support from his legislative agenda.",
        "On a blisteringly hot day nearly four years ago, we and dozens of other student survivors of sexual assault descended on the Education Department\u2019s plaza in Washington with a bullhorn. We carried boxes containing a petition with 200, 000 signatures demanding that the agency responsible for enforcing Title IX \u2014 the federal civil rights law that protects student victims of sexual assault \u2014 actually do so. One of our demands was that the department release a list of the colleges and universities under investigation for sexual violations of Title IX.",

On Friday afternoon, Shkreli strolled into a room full of surprised reporters and proceeded to handicap his case so far and ridicule prosecutors. \u201cThe case is going well,\u201d said Shkreli, 34, who boasted that his attorney, Benjamin Brafman, \u201cbrought down the house\u201d with his opening statement defending the outspoken hedge fund and pharmaceutical executive."
