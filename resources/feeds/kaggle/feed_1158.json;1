        "BEIJING \u2014 Call it President Trump\u2019s hamburger diplomacy. On Friday, U. S. Ambassador Terry Branstad, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and a clutch of American cattlemen in hats gathered at a chic hotel in Beijing to sip champagne and celebrate the return of U. S. beef after 14 years. The servings of American cattle at the event were a product of the plan negotiated when Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met at Trump\u2019s resort in April. Trump\u2019s message then was: You help us rein in North Korea, and the rest is on the table in trade talks.",
        "The baby was born healthy and without complication in September, but then its health began to deteriorate rapidly. Doctors \u2014 scrambling to uncover the cause of the infant\u2019s respiratory distress \u2014 transferred the baby to the neonatal intensive care unit and began a series of tests, according to a report released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those tests revealed a deadly blood infection known as group B Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) bacteremia, which doctors treated with an course of antibiotics.",
        "Not long after Megan Johnson gave birth, her husband posted a picture on social media, welcoming their daughter into the world. Years earlier, Johnson had been diagnosed with congestive heart failure and given a new heart and another chance to live. Her husband, Nathan, announced early Tuesday on Instagram that \u201cher heart worked perfectly\u201d during the delivery, and their daughter, Eilee Kate, \u201cintroduced herself quickly and smooth. I am a rich man! !!\u201d For the next six hours, the Johnsons loved their newborn.",
        "On Dec. 6, 1997, Jim Scotti of the Spacewatch program at the University of Arizona spotted an asteroid. This wasn\u2019t entirely unusual. The problem: It appeared the asteroid was on a possible collision course with Earth. Asteroid 1997 XF11, as it was later called, was a big one \u2014 a mile in diameter. The International Astronomical Union\u2019s Minor Planet Center was alerted. Other astronomers weighed in.",
        "\u201cIt was a world where they could laugh and be affectionate, have boyfriends \u2026 . It was one tiny bit of the world that was ours,\u201d Tom Bianchi told In Sight as he recalled photographing the gay community of Fire Island Pines from 1975 to 1983. \u201cWe were fresh out from under our parents\u2019 thumbs, in a different world with a different value system. \u201d The Pines, a slice on a barrier island east of Manhattan along the Long Island coast, was a sanctuary for up to 10, 000 gay men during weekends.",
        "Police nationwide shot and killed 492 people in the first six months of this year, a number nearly identical to the count for the same period in each of the prior two years. Fatal shootings by police in 2017 have so closely tracked last year\u2019s numbers that on June 16, the tally was the same. Although the number of unarmed people killed by police dropped slightly, the overall pace for 2017 through Friday was on track to approach 1, 000 killed for a third year in row.",
        "Sen. Susan Collins will celebrate the Fourth of July within view of the Canadian border, at a remote northeastern Maine town\u2019s annual parade. Sen. Lisa Murkowski will appear on the other end of the continent in an old timber town on an isolated Alaskan island. These two Republican senators, critical swing votes in the debate over legislation, are not exactly rushing into the public spotlight to engage their constituents on the controversial plan and their own about the proposal. Then again, at least they have released information about where they will be.",
        "President Trump is more than his own worst enemy. The damage he has inflicted during his first five months in office has undermined Republican congressional leaders, frustrated members of his Cabinet, exasperated top advisers and strained relations with some of the nation\u2019s most important allies. This week\u2019s case study is health care. The most significant domestic initiative of the Trump presidency and the Republican Party is the fulfillment of a promise to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act. That Republicans are struggling to find an alternative to Obamacare is plain to see.",
        "AUSTIN \u2014 The grand old oak called Patsy Cline rises gracefully on three trunks. Waylon Jennings leans lazily before angling back to the sun. And Willie Nelson, tall and broad, ascends on a torso three feet thick before bursting into a dense green canopy. Citizens here named the trees in an effort to save more than a dozen of them \u2014 all protected under a city ordinance \u2014 that stand in the way of a planned new development.",
        "The doctor was getting ready. Must look respectable, he told himself. Must be calm. He changed into a dark suit, blue shirt and tie and came down the wooden staircase of the stately Victorian house at Seventh and Pine that had always been occupied by the town\u2019s most prominent citizens. That was him: prominent citizen, town doctor, father of three, and as far as anyone knew, the first Muslim to ever live in Dawson, a farming town of 1, 400 people in the rural western part of the state.",
        "Ivanka Trump\u2019s office: clean, white, quiet. A zone of punctual start times and water bottles, and a conference table at which she conducts meetings. A short, winding walk away from her father\u2019s Oval Office downstairs. She does not necessarily appreciate daily schedules. Neither does her father. When Ivanka needs to see the president, she stops by. When he needs to see her, he calls. When he wants her opinion, he asks for it and she gives it, but without expectation that it will be followed.",
        "Some of the faces in the Trump administration are also some of the according to a new list of White House salaries. Advisers Kellyanne Conway and Stephen K. Bannon, along with Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Press Secretary Sean Spicer, are among the White House employees receiving the top salary of $179, 700. Omarosa Manigault, whose title is listed as director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison, is also one of the 22 Trump aides bringing in that top salary.",
        "As Independence Day approaches, Americans are divided. We are conflicted along lines of party, region, education and class \u2014 and these divisions have left us with a politics that just feels broken. We all love our country, but we can\u2019t even agree on why and how to love it. Patriotism itself has become a sticking point. There has long been an argument, roughly along the axis of conservatism and progressivism, about whether to love America for what it has been or what it should be.",
        "Today, \u201cniceness\u201d is not a word that most people associate with Americans. The bombastic chauvinism of the Ugly American seems to be everywhere, as personified by our president, who called MSNBC presenters Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski \u201cPsycho Joe\u201d and \u201clow I. Q. Crazy Mika\u201d in a Thursday morning Twitter rant. This was only the latest in a long line of insults the president has leveled at rivals, enemies and other public figures.",
        "I have an Independence Day tradition: I like to listen to songs about America. My favorites tend to be critical of this country in some way, such as Woody Guthrie\u2019s \u201cThis Land Is Your Land\u201d or Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u201cBorn in the USA. \u201d These aren\u2019t the anthems their titles suggest; they\u2019re searing indictments of a nation that failed its citizens by leaving them poor, stuck and feeling \u2014 as Springsteen sings \u2014 \u201clike a dog that\u2019s been beat too much.",
        "On June 16, in a move that shook the grocery industry, Amazon agreed to purchase Whole Foods for $13. 7 billion. Yet just a day before, Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder (and the owner of The Washington Post) made an announcement that could prove an even greater disruption to a different sector: philanthropy. Bezos\u2019s philanthropic activity has been surprisingly modest, at least relative to his vast wealth; the Whole Foods revelation boosted his net worth and vaulted him into second place in Forbes\u2019s rankings of the world\u2019s billionaires.",
        "It is no wonder so many myths about health insurance persist. The U. S. health insurance system is opaque and labyrinthine, and at times purposely so. The current debate over whether to repeal major provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) otherwise known as Obamacare, comes down to whether consumers should subsidize services they never expect to use. But who pays for what, and how, is not straightforward. Myth No. 1 The ACA has forced millions to buy insurance they don\u2019t want.",
        "ALMOST EXACTLY 4\u00bd years after the U. S. government\u2019s leading antitrust agency decided that Google had not unlawfully abused its position as the world\u2019s No. 1 Internet search engine, the European Commission in Brussels has reached a contrary conclusion. After lengthy investigation, the commission ruled that Google had violated European antitrust law, and slapped the U. S. company with a $2. 7 billion fine. This turn of events proves the United States and Europe have different approaches to fighting monopoly.",
        "BRIDGEWATER, N. J. \u2014 The president is on vacation from Washington \u2014 but not from Twitter. And certainly not from his ongoing feuds with cable television news networks MSNBC and CNN. The Tweeter in Chief was busy Saturday morning, launching familiar attacks against the two networks over their coverage of him. Continuing his beef with MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d President Trump suggested that the hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski are \u201cnot bad people\u201d \u2014 even as he disparaged them again \u2014 but that their show is undermined by their bosses at the network.",
        "President Trump\u2019s ceremony Friday to bring back the National Space Council began to confuse people even before it took place. It was, Trump would say, a big deal: an executive order to resurrect an advisory council that the first moon missions 60 years ago, went dormant in the 1990s, and could now lead astronauts into deep space \u2014 even Mars. \u201cAt some point in the future, we\u2019re going to look back and say how did we do it without space?\u201d is how the president put it.",
        "OFF THE COAST OF NAMIBIA \u2014 Deep beneath this frigid stretch of the Atlantic Ocean, some of the world\u2019s most valuable diamonds are scattered like lost change. The discovery of such gems has sparked a revolution in one of the world\u2019s most storied industries, sending mining companies on a race for precious stones buried just under the seafloor. For over a century, diamond mines have been some of the most valuable real estate on Earth, with small swaths of southern Africa producing billions of dollars of wealth. But those mines are gradually being exhausted.",
        "One of the organizers of the disastrous Fyre Festival has been arrested and charged with wire fraud, according to the U. S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York. Billy McFarland was arrested Friday in New York and accused of making \u201cfalse representations to investors\u201d in his company, Fyre Media LLC, and in a \u201cluxury\u201d music festival that had been set to take place in the Bahamas over two weekends in April and May. Acting Manhattan U. S.",
        "AUGUSTA, Maine \u2014 Little in politics has surprised Richard Malaby as much as the power of dentists. For years, local dentists held four Christmas parties at Malaby\u2019s country inn in the picturesque town of Hancock. But in 2014, Malaby, a Republican lawmaker in the Maine state legislature, voted to create a new type of dental provider to perform basic services in poor and rural areas. The Maine Dental Association, which opposed the bill, was furious. And the dentists took their Christmas parties elsewhere, costing Malaby $6, 000 that December and every Yuletide since.",
        "Police say 25 people were shot when a suspected gang rivalry erupted inside a packed club in Little Rock early Saturday. Several others were injured attempting to escape, with reports that some jumped from windows at the Power Ultra Lounge. Two people were still in critical condition Saturday afternoon, according to police. \u201cWhen you force these two communities into a small room and some kind of dispute ensues, it was a recipe for disaster,\u201d Police Chief Kenton Buckner told reporters at a Saturday news conference.",
        "It\u2019s no secret that we shouldn\u2019t be drinking so much soda. Study after study has linked the sweet drink with obesity and Type 2 diabetes, spurring many to switch to artificially sweetened drinks. But even diet sodas have come under fire, with a 2014 study in the American Journal of Public Health suggesting that diet soda isn\u2019t promoting weight loss or helping people take in fewer calories. Worse yet, new research suggests that drinking diet soda may speed up brain aging and increase the risk for stroke, dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",

        "Michelle Nichols speaks with such passion and poetry about the moon passing in front of the sun that she can inspire someone with even the smallest sliver of astronomical knowledge (such as this travel writer) to begin planning a trip to see the total solar eclipse on Aug. 21. It looks like a hole in the sky. In the middle of the day, the sky goes dark and you can see stars and planets, ? says Nichols, who is director of public observing at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago. I ve seen one total solar eclipse, which was .",
        "BRIDGEWATER, N. J. \u2014 A day after defending his use of social media as befitting a \u201cmodern day\u201d president, President Trump appeared to promote violence against CNN in a tweet. Trump, who is on vacation at his Bedminster golf resort, posted on Twitter an old video clip of him performing in a WWE professional wrestling match, but with a CNN logo superimposed on the head of his opponent. In the clip, Trump is shown slamming the CNN avatar to the ground and pounding him with simulated punches and elbows to the head.",
        "Another bizarre tweet from the president of the United States. Another round of outrage and condemnation from lawmakers. President Trump on Sunday morning posted to Twitter a doctored video clip that showed him slamming a man \u2014 with \u201cCNN\u201d superimposed on his head \u2014 to the ground. In the video, Trump then throws punches at the man\u2019s head, before walking away.

        "As Republicans return to their home districts to sell a flailing bill, liberal groups are using the congressional recess to build opposition. They believe tens of thousands of phone calls, emails and pushes will force senators to reject the legislation for good. The fresh activism is coming with encouragement from Democratic lawmakers who are mired in the minority and have been mostly left to watch as Republicans struggle to reshape the nation\u2019s laws to their liking."
