        "As the Trump administration sets out to overhaul the federal government, a small group of Cabinet secretaries may have the most daunting task. They are running departments with missions they have repeatedly disparaged, with employees who are secretly \u2014 and on occasion publicly \u2014 hostile. Across the agencies, these Cabinet members have made very public efforts to court their staff, yet frequently are crafting key initiatives in private. They are forming alliances where they can and skirmishing where they cannot.",
        "A trend grips the United States. The San Francisco airport now deploys a pig to calm frazzled travelers. Universities nationwide bring dogs (and a donkey) onto campus to soothe students during finals. Llamas comfort hospital patients, pooches provide succor at disaster sites and horses are used to treat sex addiction. And that duck on a plane? It might be an animal prescribed by a mental health professional.",
        "TABQA, SYRIA The Islamic State\u2019s headquarters in this city at the western gateway to Raqqa has been crushed like a sandcastle by American bombs. At a dam complex on the Euphrates River where the Islamic State was torturing prisoners and hurling alleged homosexuals from a giant concrete tower, all that\u2019s left of the extremists are militant slogans scrawled on the wall and a pile of trash. It\u2019s far too soon to say that life is returning to normal here after liberation, but much of the horror is over. Mines and improvised explosive devices were cleared here last week.",
        "SYDNEY \u2014 Australia\u2019s urbane prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, is trying to revive the fortunes of his unpopular government by borrowing from an unexpected role model: President Trump. When he ousted his conservative predecessor, Tony Abbott, from office in 2015, Turnbull had made his reputation supporting the legalization of marriage, the strengthening of ties with China and the replacement of Queen Elizabeth II as the head of state with an Australian. Representing one of the most progressive districts in the country, Turnbull is one of the most members of the Liberal Party.",
        "Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. delivered eight opinions and two dissents in the Supreme Court term. But none probably meant as much as the statement he handed down on a rainy, early June morning in a small New Hampshire town. It was the commencement address for the Cardigan Mountain School, an elite boarding school for boys grades six through nine. Sitting up front under a large white tent as John Glover Roberts Jr. took the stage was graduating student John Glover Roberts III. In Canaan, N. H.",
        "HENDAYE, France \u2014 They gathered at the bridge, now rusting in disrepair. A handful of former Jewish refugees, now in their late 80s and early 90s, returned this week to the craggy and verdant border between France and Spain, mostly to pay tribute to the largely forgotten Portuguese diplomat who saved their lives in the early days of World War II. But with Europe in the throes of a different kind of refugee crisis, these former asylum seekers and their descendants also came to highlight the urgent need for action today.",
        "An American destroyer sailed near a disputed island in the South China Sea on Sunday, a U. S. defense official said, marking the second such operation since President Trump took office. The USS Stethem, an Arleigh destroyer, sailed within 12 miles of Triton Island, a small landmass in the Paracel Islands chain. Fox News first reported on the incident, known as a operation, or FONOP.

        "When Judge Aaron Persky sentenced a Stanford swimmer who sexually assaulted a woman behind a dumpster to six months in jail, critics came up with a slew of reasons for what they viewed as a frustratingly lenient punishment. Persky, they said, was biased against women and didn\u2019t take sexual assault seriously. They accused him of giving Brock Turner a light sentence because he was affluent and white. They even said Persky was biased because he, too, had been a at Stanford.",

Or you could cook up a new look for the focal point of your living room.

        "An appeals court Monday struck down the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s suspension of new emission standards on oil and gas wells, a decision that could set back the Trump administration\u2019s broad legal strategy for rolling back rules. In a ruling, the U. S.

        "To judge by the unfiltered contents of President Trump\u2019s psyche as expressed through his Twitter feed, there is nothing he cares about more as president of the United States \u2014 not health care, not regulation, not taxes, not trade \u2014 than his ongoing battles with the news media. And whenever he says or tweets something more appalling than the last thing he said or tweeted, what ensues is a regular and repeated pattern that goes like this: Trump tweets something despicable. Elected Republicans say, \u201cI don\u2019t approve of this.",
        "President Trump\u2019s latest salvo in his campaign is a doctored video clip posted to his personal Twitter account showing him beating up a man with a CNN logo on his face. The tweet has drawn predictable outcries: \u201cIt\u2019s not just . It\u2019s of the press,\u201d said CNN political analyst and Pulitzer Prize winner Carl Bernstein on Sunday.

        "THE MORNING PLUM: President Trump spent some of the weekend on the phone with wavering GOP senators, pressuring them to get them behind the GOP bill.

        "As a contractor for the Justice Department, Hui Chen would ask probing questions about companies\u2019 inner workings to help determine whether they should be prosecuted for wrongdoing. But working in the Trump administration, Chen began to feel like a hypocrite. How could she ask companies about their conflicts of interest when the president was being sued over his? \u201cHow do I sit across the table from companies and ask about their policies on conflict of interest, when everybody had woken up and read the same news?\u201d Chen said in an interview.",

He\u2019s lived in Los Angeles, and spent time in cities such as, yes, Amsterdam, so it\u2019s fair to say that he\u2019s not particularly prudish in his social life. And yet . . . leaving a Washington parking lot recently, he took pause when a distinctively skunky scent passed under his nostrils. Of course he\u2019d smelled marijuana before.

Its stark imagery \u2014 coupled with Second Amendment advocate Dana Loesch\u2019s severe language and scowl \u2014 left many critics with the impression that the video was designed to provoke fear, if not incite violence.

Gorsuch\u2019s voting record, NPR legal affairs reporter Nina Totenberg dropped this tantalizing piece of news about Justice Anthony M. Kennedy\u2019s potential retirement: Kennedy may also have thought it best to ensure that there is a full complement of nine justices for at least a year. He could even have been put off by President Trump\u2019s tweets about the judiciary. But it is unlikely that Kennedy will remain on the court for the full four years of the Trump presidency."
