        "North Korea\u2019s test launch Tuesday of what appeared to be an intercontinental ballistic missile marks a direct challenge to President Trump, whose tough talk has yet to yield any change in Pyongyang\u2019s behavior as the regime continues its efforts to build a nuclear weapon capable of striking the mainland United States. The latest missile flew higher and remained in the air longer than previous attempts \u2014 enough to reach all of Alaska, experts said, in a major milestone for North Korea\u2019s weapons program.",
        "The U. S. Army and South Korean military responded to North Korea\u2019s latest launch with their own exercise of missiles, launching them Wednesday into South Korean territorial waters along the country\u2019s eastern coastline, U. S. Pacific Command said in a statement. The launches were directly in response to \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s destabilizing and unlawful actions,\u201d Pacific Command said. The Army used its Army Tactical Missile System and South Korea used its Hyunmoo Missile II, which can be deployed rapidly and provide \u201cdeep strike precision capability,\u201d Pacific Command said. The South . S.",
        "The North Korean missile that soared high above the Sea of Japan on Tuesday was hailed by television as a \u201cshining success. \u201d But to U. S. officials, it was a most unwelcome surprise: a weapon with intercontinental range, delivered years before most Western experts believed such a feat possible. Hours after the apparently successful test, intelligence agencies continued to run calculations to determine precisely how the missile, dubbed the performed in its maiden flight.",
        "As the nation\u2019s 50th Fourth of July approached in 1826, Thomas Jefferson was at one of the lowest points of his life. The author of the Declaration of Independence turned 83 on April 13. Just two months before, his beloved eldest granddaughter, Ann Cary Randolph Bankhead, had died after childbirth as Jefferson wept inconsolably in the next room. She had suffered abuse from her alcoholic husband, and Jefferson tried his best to support her. But now everything was crumbling.",
        "This Fourth of July, look closely at one of those printed copies of the Declaration of Independence. See it? The woman\u2019s name at the bottom? It\u2019s right there. Mary Katharine Goddard. If you\u2019ve never noticed it or heard of her, you aren\u2019t alone. She\u2019s a Founding Mother, of sorts, yet few folks know about her. And some of America\u2019s earliest bureaucrats did their best to shut her down. Same old, same old.",
        "On a passing float, Sikhs wearing turbans and American flag ties sang \u201cHappy Birthday, U. S. A. \u201d \u2014 and Julie Blaskovich watched in awe. She thought about differences and common ground and a diversity that wasn\u2019t always obvious in her home town of McKinney, Tex. The mother of four had come to celebrate the Fourth of July on the Mall, among buildings and colorful bursts of patriotism \u2014 and the city was delivering. A float with the banner \u201cVietnamese Americans Celebrating Freedom\u201d rolled past shortly after the Sikhs of America\u2019s float.",
        "WARSAW \u2014 President Trump promised voters that he would strike \u201ca great deal\u201d with Russia and its autocratic president, Vladimir Putin. He has repeatedly labeled an investigation of Russian meddling in the U. S. elections as \u201ca hoax,\u201d and he even bragged to Russian officials about firing the FBI director leading the probe. Now nearly six months into his presidency, Trump is set to finally meet Putin at a summit this week in Hamburg after a stop here in Warsaw \u2014 severely constrained and facing few good options that would leave him politically unscathed.",
        "David Rothkopf is the author of \u201cThe Great Questions of Tomorrow. \u201d He is a visiting professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs and a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Last week, at the Aspen Ideas Festival, I moderated a panel on U. S. national security in the Trump era. On the panel, former CIA director David H. Petraeus offered the most robust defense of President Trump\u2019s foreign policy that I have heard. Central to his premise were two facts.",
        "On this Fourth of July, what better time to reflect on what we have learned over the past six months about the 45th president of the United States?

Excerpts from James Madison\u2019s redacted notes during the Constitutional Convention follow below. JOURNAL OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION OF 1787 Monday, May 28 Discussion progressed apace. The Virginia Plan was accepted as a basis for debate.

        "We celebrate the Fourth of July as an anniversary of sorts, a day to commemorate the shared dream that brought us together as a country. In between the flags and fireworks, such a major milestone is as good a moment as any to take stock of how our relationship is doing. The answer is not so great. It\u2019s been 241 years and counting, but we may be falling apart. Evidence?",
        "When I worked in the White House at the National Security Council from 2009 to 2012, I wrote briefers for President Barack Obama for his \u201cbilats\u201d with Dmitry Medvedev and Minister Vladimir Putin. I have written an (unsolicited) backgrounder deliberately for President Trump; short, simple and with his stated views on Russia in mind ahead of this week\u2019s meeting between the U. S. and Russian presidents. Backgrounder on U. S. relations For three decades, American presidents sought to encourage democratic and market reforms inside Russia and integrate Russia into the West.",
        "Question: Could the energy boom save President Trump and the GOP in the 2018 midterms? Answer: No. But it could go a long way toward producing the kind of robust economy that will help incumbent Republicans a year from November. The energy boom is real, and it is here to stay. (Disclosure: My firm represents oil and gas companies.) Energy production produces good jobs and low gasoline prices pump billions of dollars in cash into the economy, in real time.",
        "The $19 billion bid to clean the Chesapeake Bay and restore its health rests on a simple plan: cut the amount of nutrient waste \u2014 involving nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment \u2014 that causes most of the bay\u2019s pollution. For nearly seven years since the cleanup started, the federal government and six states in the bay\u2019s watershed have reduced municipal sewer overflows that pour nitrogen and phosphorus into rivers that feed into the bay and cut the fertilizers and other nutrients that run off from hundreds of farms.",
        "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. \u2014 The Illinois Senate voted to override Gov. Bruce Rauner\u2019s vetoes of a $36 billion budget package Tuesday, including a $5 billion tax increase designed to start digging out of the nation\u2019s longest budget crisis since at least the Great Depression. The chamber completed its work within 30 minutes of the Republican governor\u2019s vetoes, sending the package back to the House for an override vote that would give Illinois its first annual budget since 2015. The House did not plan to take up the action Tuesday.",
        "The companies that manufacture and distribute highly addictive painkillers are facing a barrage of lawsuits for the toll their product has taken on communities across the country as the worst drug epidemic in U. S. history continues to escalate.

        "The 400 Spanish conquistadors who walked into the Aztec capital in the 16th century had conquest and riches on their minds, but they were initially welcomed as friends. From that peaceful vantage point, they were amazed by the splendor of the people of Tenochtitlan \u2014 and their cannibalistic brutality. They found temples soaked with blood and human hearts being burned in ceramic braziers, according to the Archaeological Institute of America. They had heard tales of thousands sacrificed at the Great Temple\u2019s dedication, four rows of victims that stretched for miles, all waiting to have their hearts torn out.",
        "Iranian artist Hadi Asadi has beaten hundreds of other contestants to win first place in a \u201cTrumpism\u201d cartoon contest held in Tehran \u2014 his winning caricature depicting President Trump as a man wearing a suit made of dollar bills, drooling onto a pile of books. The competition, called the International Trumpism Cartoon and Caricature Contest, was announced last month. It was organized by a group that has also organized cartoon contests on themes such as the Islamic State and the Holocaust (the group says the latter was designed to highlight double standards on free speech).",
        "Two thousand years ago, Roman builders constructed vast sea walls and harbor piers. The concrete they used outlasted the empire \u2014 and still holds lessons for modern engineers, scientists say. A bunch of structures off the Italian coast might sound less impressive than a gladiatorial colosseum. But underwater, the marvel is in the material. The harbor concrete, a mixture of volcanic ash and quicklime, has withstood the sea for two millennia and counting. What\u2019s more, it is stronger than when it was first mixed.",
        "President Trump and key global leaders are on a collision course ahead of the Group of 20 summit in Germany this week, with Trump\u2019s unapologetic \u201cAmerica First\u201d mantra on trade and climate change running into emboldened, and increasingly united, opposition overseas. Trump reiterated his threats on Wednesday to pull the United States back from existing trade deals, arguing they were against the national interest. As Trump threatens to retreat from global trade, other world powers are exploring new economic ties. The European Union and Japan are expected on Thursday to announce plans for a major new free trade agreement.",
        "We forget sometimes that President Trump\u2019s political rhetoric was forged not over years of policymaking or in discussions with experts on foreign policy and domestic issues, but in weekly phone interviews with \u201cFox and Friends. \u201d Before he declared his candidacy, the real estate developer and TV personality would appear on the program every Monday morning, weighing in on the issues of the day as the hosts offered their lack of criticism of his musings.",
        "BEIJING \u2014 The Trump administration has called for \u201cglobal action\u201d on North Korea, but as concern about the July 4 missile test and its aftermath deepens, the world\u2019s biggest players, the United States and China, are at odds about what to do next. Tuesday\u2019s launch was a display of the North\u2019s weapon yet \u2014 an intercontinental ballistic missile with a range that experts say covers Alaska. Before his inauguration, President Trump said North Korea\u2019s plan to develop an ICBM capable of hitting the United States \u201cwon\u2019t happen\u201d and he has since repeatedly talked tough on the issue.",
        "One America News is an obscure TV channel struggling to emerge from the cellar of the cable ratings, but it is nonetheless one of President Trump\u2019s favorite media outlets.

        "A New York City police officer was shot and killed in an \u201cunprovoked attack\u201d as she was sitting in a marked police vehicle early Wednesday in the Bronx, authorities said. Officer Miosotis Familia was inside the large vehicle \u2014 known as a mobile command post \u2014 with her partner at 12:30 a. m. when a gunman fired through a window and struck Familia in the head, police said. The city\u2019s police commissioner called the shooting an assassination. Familia, a NYPD veteran, was taken to a hospital in extremely critical condition, police said. Police Commissioner James P.",
        "Did Democrats ignore \u2014 or worse, condescend to \u2014 white voters in 2016? Did many of these voters back Donald Trump because of his promises to restore economic growth for small towns and in manufacturing and mining \u2014 or because they resented rising prospects for minorities and women? Can these voters be returned to the Democratic fold with sharper economic messaging? Or does appealing to them require an unthinkable retreat on issues of social justice and inclusion? These questions have divided Democrats since Election Day.",
        "Ray Takeyh is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. In recent congressional testimony, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sensibly stressed that the United States should \u201cwork towards support of those elements inside of Iran that would lead to a peaceful transition of that government. \u201d The commentariat was aghast, and the Islamic republic registered a formal protest note. Both parties seemed surprised that the United States has long assisted those seeking democratic change. During the Cold War, secretaries of state routinely assured those trapped behind the Iron Curtain that America supported their aspirations.",
        "Michael Morell was the deputy director of the CIA from 2010 to 2013 and twice served as acting director. Samantha Vinograd served on the National Security Council staff from 2009 to 2013, including as senior adviser to the national security adviser. This is a speculative account of a memo that Russian President Vladi mir Putin\u2019s national security team would likely send him as he prepares to meet with President Trump for the first time this week.",
        "Following North Korea\u2019s July 4 launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile, the Trump administration is focused on rallying the international community to punish Pyongyang and increasing the pressure on the Kim Jong Un regime to abandon its nuclear and missile programs. But behind the scenes, officials have been cautiously discussing the conditions under which the United States could reengage in direct dialogue with North Korea.",
        "Officials in nearly every state say they cannot or will not turn over all of the voter data President Trump\u2019s voting commission is seeking, dealing what could be a serious blow to Trump\u2019s attempts to bolster his claims that widespread fraud cost him the popular vote in November. The commission\u2019s request for a massive amount of data last week included asking for all publicly available information about voter rolls in the states, such as names of all registrants, addresses, dates of birth, partial Social Security numbers and other data.",
        "Robert S. Mueller III was greeted with near universal praise when he was appointed to lead the investigation into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election, but as he builds his special counsel team, his every hire is under scrutiny. At least seven of the 15 lawyers Mueller has brought on to the special counsel team have donated to Democratic political candidates, five of them to Hillary Clinton \u2014 a fact that President Trump and his allies have eagerly highlighted."
