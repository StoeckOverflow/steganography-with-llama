        "For about 20 minutes Tuesday, NPR traveled back to 1776. To echo its tradition, the public radio network\u2019s main Twitter account tweeted out the Declaration of Independence, line by line. There \u2014 in 113 consecutive posts, in increments \u2014 was the text of the treasured founding document of the United States, from its soaring opening to its searing indictments of King George III\u2019s \u201cabsolute tyranny\u201d to its very last signature. Who could have taken issue with such a patriotic exercise, done in honor of the nation\u2019s birthday? Quite a few people, it turned out.",
        "What happened to Amelia Earhart? That question has captivated the public ever since her plane vanished over the Pacific Ocean in 1937 as she attempted to become the first female pilot to fly around the world. Now, investigators believe they have discovered the \u201csmoking gun\u201d that would support a theory that Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, were captured by the Japanese: a newly unearthed photograph from the National Archives that purportedly shows Earhart and Noonan \u2014 and their plane \u2014 on an atoll in the Marshall Islands.",
        "CARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Venezuelan lawmakers who oppose President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro were beaten and bloodied in the halls of congress Wednesday as a mob stormed the building, apparently facing little or no resistance from security guards. The attack left at least 15 people injured, according to opposition leaders, including one lawmaker who was rushed to the hospital with broken ribs and a head wound. Scenes of the melee shared on social media showed masked assailants kicking and punching lawmakers in the chambers of congress and in the streets outside.",
        "An enormous iceberg, more than 2, 000 square miles in area \u2014 or nearly the size of Delaware \u2014 is poised to detach from one of the largest floating ice shelves in Antarctica and float off in the Weddell Sea, south of the tip of South America. Scientists have been expecting the break from the Larsen C ice shelf, monitoring the progress of a crack that extended to over 100 miles long in recent months.",
        "Musicians play as people gather outside the Floyd Country Store during the \u201cFriday Night Jamboree. \u201d Southwestern Virginia has a rich history of music. (Matt Washington Post) It\u2019s Friday evening at the Floyd Country Store, one of the landmarks along Virginia\u2019s Crooked Road, which anchors a tradition of live music throughout the state. The Stanley Brothers played along the road, which winds through southwestern Virginia and is formally known as Virginia\u2019s Heritage Music Trail. The Carter family, too, for generations. And on Friday nights on Locust Street in Floyd, Va. it still feels like the good old days.",
        "WARSAW \u2014 President Trump on Thursday reaffirmed the United States\u2019 bond with European allies, calling their pact as \u201cstrong as ever. \u201d Yet he argued in a speech here that Western values are increasingly imperiled by terrorism and extremism. In a dark and provocative address with nationalist overtones, Trump said that \u201cthe fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive. \u201d \u201cDo we have the confidence in our values to defend them at any cost?\u201d Trump said. \u201cDo we have enough respect for our citizens to protect our borders?",
        "President Trump says he still isn\u2019t quite sure that Russia was behind \u2014 or solely behind \u2014 the hacking of the 2016 election. This is despite intelligence officials having said on numerous occasions that they have no doubt about that conclusion. But it\u2019s how and where Trump aired his doubts Thursday that were really noteworthy. At a news conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda in Warsaw, Trump said that he thought Russia was behind the hacking, but then he repeatedly qualified it by saying he couldn\u2019t be sure.",
        "HAMBURG \u2014 German security forces clad in riot gear clashed with protesters on the eve of the Group of 20 summit here, using water cannons and pepper spray to clear an march in which a militant group with anarchist sympathies had a prominent presence. The skirmish followed an standoff adjacent to Hamburg\u2019s harbor, where protesters were attempting to move from a public square toward the downtown conference center where Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, is hosting foreign leaders, including President Trump, in a summit that begins Friday.",
        "The director of the independent Office of Government Ethics, who has been the federal government\u2019s most persistent critic of the Trump administration\u2019s approach to ethics, announced Thursday that he is resigning nearly six months before his term is scheduled to end. Walter M. Shaub Jr. repeatedly challenged the Trump administration, publicly urging President Trump to fully divest from his business empire and chastising a senior Trump adviser for violating ethics rules. His outspokenness drew the ire of administration officials and earned him status among Trump\u2019s opponents.",
        "JOINT BASE Va. \u2014 Her day begins following a man on a red motorcycle as he bumps down a rutted road past palm trees and cement block houses. An assault rifle is slung across his back. While her partner stares at the video feed from an armed Air Force drone, Courtney, 29, a staff sergeant and intelligence analyst, fires off questions and compiles a running narrative. \u201cWhat\u2019s the driver wearing?\u201d she asks, keeping one eye on the action as she types. \u201cBlack Western wear,\u201d says Aaron, 20, the airman assisting her.",
        "Sen. Patrick J. Toomey offered a simple, remarkable explanation this week for why Republicans have struggled so mightily to find a way to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \u201cLook, I didn\u2019t expect Donald Trump to win. I think most of my colleagues didn\u2019t, so we didn\u2019t expect to be in this situation,\u201d the Pennsylvania Republican said Wednesday night during a meeting with voters hosted by four ABC affiliates across his state.",
        "For those about to troll, Hillary Clinton salutes you. With policy. Defending the GOP\u2019s plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, the Republican National Committee sent several tweets Wednesday criticizing key senators \u2014 plus the Clintons \u2014 for their lack of support. \u201cOur health care system is collapsing, but Democrats refuse to bring anything to the table. Where\u2019s THEIR plan?\u201d @GOP posted Wednesday, showing clips from Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( .) Sen. Joe Manchin III ( . Va.) Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) and former president Bill Clinton acknowledging issues with the system.",
        "\u201cA little learning is a dangerous thing,\u201d wrote the poet Alexander Pope. Three centuries later, Pope\u2019s aphorism perfectly \u2014 and dangerously \u2014 describes President Trump\u2019s understanding of history as a clash of civilizations in which \u201cthe West\u201d can triumph by imposing its will. The speech Trump delivered Thursday in Warsaw\u2019s Krasinski Square might have been appropriate when Britannia ruled the waves and Europe\u2019s great powers held dominion over \u201clesser\u201d peoples around the globe. It had nothing useful to say about today\u2019s interconnected world in which goods, people and ideas have contempt for borders.",
        "In Washington, there is a conventional wisdom on North Korea that spans both parties and much of elite opinion. It goes roughly like this: North Korea is the world\u2019s most bizarre country, run by a crackpot dictator with a strange haircut. He is unpredictable and irrational and cannot be negotiated with. Eventually this weird and cruel regime will collapse. Meanwhile, the only solution is more and more pressure. But what if the conventional wisdom is wrong?",
        "As yet another crisis looms in Northeast Asia, don\u2019t bet against North Korea. In international affairs, as in life, clarity of purpose can be a huge advantage. And of all the parties to this seemingly endless struggle, only the regime in Pyongyang has it. Kim Jong Un is heir to a family dynasty whose organizing principle \u2014 hold on to power, at all costs, and by any means necessary \u2014 has been constant ever since his grandfather, the \u201cGreat Leader\u201d Kim Il Sung founded it nearly seven decades ago.",
        "Sometimes, in some weird markets, too much consumer choice can be a bad thing. Unfortunately for Republicans, health insurance happens to be one of those weird markets. Republicans believe the problem with the system is that Americans are forced to buy too much insurance, in plans that are too prescribed. Their solution is to give consumers more choices for what kinds of plans (including no plan at all) they can buy. The Consumer Freedom Option, recently proposed by Sen.",
        "It is sometimes argued that the media should spend less time on President Trump\u2019s transgressive tweets in order to devote more attention to real issues, such as North Korea. In fact, it is necessary to focus on Trump\u2019s tweets precisely because they shed light on the mind that is doing the deciding on North Korea. It is a distasteful exercise. But we cannot look away. We need to know the state of mind we\u2019re dealing with. Trump\u2019s tweets reveal a leader who is compulsive, abusive and easily triggered. Trump describes all this as \u201cmodern day presidential.",
        "\u201cDO WE have the confidence in our values to defend them at any cost?\u201d President Trump asked during his speech in Warsaw on Thursday. That\u2019s an important question, and so is this: Which values is he summoning us to defend? There were encouraging elements in his address suggesting that he was referring to the universal values that America celebrated earlier this week, on the anniversary of its declaration of independence. Repeatedly, Mr. Trump invoked the parallel Polish and American devotion to freedom. He spoke of \u201cAmerica\u2019s commitment to your security and your place in a strong and democratic Europe.",
        "The Department of Justice said Thursday that some sanctuary cities have \u201cboldly asserted\u201d they will not comply with requests from federal immigration agents, setting the stage for a new dispute between localities and the Trump administration. The clash centers on whether local jurisdictions are required to provide information to federal deportation agents about a person\u2019s immigration status, particularly the status of someone who has been arrested in connection with a local crime.",
        "The Trump administration announced plans to keep voter roll data it has requested from all 50 states and the District on White House computers under the direction of a member of Vice President Pence\u2019s staff, it told a federal judge Thursday. The disclosure of the White House role came in a government filing required in a lawsuit by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a watchdog organization that has asked a federal judge in Washington to block the requests for voter data until the impact on Americans\u2019 privacy can be fully assessed.",
        "Speaking at a power plant in Maidsville, W. Va. on Thursday, Energy Secretary Rick Perry made a strange argument about supply and demand, seeming to confuse the relationship between two of the essential forces in the economy. \u201cHere\u2019s a little economics lesson: supply and demand,\u201d Perry said, according to Taylor Kuykendall of Standard & Poor\u2019s. \u201cYou put the supply out there, and demand will follow. \u201d People often talk about supply and demand in economics, but not in the way Perry used the terms.",
        "The Trump administration plans to appoint Georgia Public Health Commissioner Brenda Fitzgerald to become the next director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one of the most crucial public health positions in the U. S. government given the agency\u2019s role in tracking and stopping infectious disease outbreaks nationally and globally. Public health sources said the appointment is expected to be announced as early as Friday. Fitzgerald, 70, an who has headed that state\u2019s public health department since 2011, will succeed Tom Frieden.",
        "Fox News is probably happy to have the president of the United States tweet its videos. But maybe not so much this one. Trump a short while ago tweeted an excerpt from his speech in Poland, using Fox\u2019s feed. It was the section about the fight for Western civilization and the need to come together against foes like \u201cradical Islamic terrorism. \u201d But look at that chyron in the still image of Trump\u2019s tweet: THE WEST WILL NEVER BE BROKEN. Our values will PREVAIL. Our people will THRIVE and our civilization will TRIUMPH! pic. twitter. \u2014 Donald J.",
        "A major New York hospital has offered to admit Charlie Gard, the terminally ill infant at the center of a worldwide controversy that has drawn sympathy and support from Pope Francis and President Trump. New York Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University Irving Medical Center said they would admit and evaluate Charlie \u201cprovided that arrangements are made to safely transfer him to our facility, legal hurdles are cleared, and we receive emergency approval from the FDA for an experimental treatment as appropriate,\u201d the hospital said Thursday in an email statement to The Washington Post. The U. S.",
        "THE WORDS \u201csuperhero fatigue\u201d have been loitering around Hollywood so long that the term itself is getting tiresome. Fortunately, in 2017, the cinematic minds who guide the Spandex franchises have been especially nimble in their abilities to adapt and reinvigorate the form. The year has already given us two of the most enjoyable superhero films in recent years, in \u201cLogan\u201d and \u201cWonder Woman\u201d \u2014 and they are to be joined this week by \u201c : Homecoming,\u201d which is similarly enriched by an infusion from other genres.",
        "This post is part of the In Sight series, \u201cPHOTOGRAPHERS edit PHOTOGRAPHERS. \u201d In this installment, NOOR photographer Alixandra Fazzina edits the work of her colleague, French photographer Benedicte Kurzen. Kurzen began her career in Gaza, covering the Middle East, before moving to South Africa in 2005. There she spent six years, focusing on conflict and social issues. Here\u2019s what Fazzina had to say about Kurzen\u2019s work: \u201cWhen Benedicte presented me a selection of close to 300 entirely analogue medium format images of her time in South Africa, I felt at once that I knew them well.",
        "Three of Ben Carson\u2019s top advisers, including campaign manager Barry Bennett, quit Thursday following an internal power struggle, a sharp decline in the polls and a week of confusion about who would remain on the former neurosurgeon\u2019s presidential campaign team. \u201dBarry Bennett and I have resigned from the Carson campaign effective immediately,\u201d said departed communications director Doug Watts in a statement to The Washington Post. \u201dWe respect the candidate and we have enjoyed helping him go from far back in the field to top tier status.\u201d Hours later, Carson\u2019s deputy campaign manager Lisa Coen also submitted her resignation.",
        "MUSCATINE, Iowa  \u201d Chris Christie is the consummate New Hampshire candidate, all the way down to his silver lapel pin in the outline of the Granite State. Yet this week the New Jersey governor was in a relative wilderness, caravaning along the slushy roads of eastern Iowa and sporting a different pin on his suit jacket: the Iowa state flag.",
        "As President Obama flew home from Asia aboard Air Force One in late November, he scolded his aides about how poorly the administration was communicating the U. S. strategy against the Islamic State. Throughout the trip, which had begun less than 24 hours after the terrorist attacks in Paris, he had listened to critics at home and abroad charge that he had no coherent game plan. Some had even suggested that France, with tough talk and a series of retaliatory air strikes, was now leading the fight.",
        "DUBAI \u2014 A fire broke out at the Address Hotel in Dubai on Thursday just hours before a planned New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks display nearby. The fire erupted as people gathered for the celebration at the complex that includes the world\u2019s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. The hotel, which also includes residential apartments, is located near the skyscraper, the centerpiece for an extravagant fireworks display designed to ring in the new year."
