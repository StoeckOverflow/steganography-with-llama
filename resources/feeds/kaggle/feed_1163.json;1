Odds are, they won\u2019t succeed. Just 8 percent achieve their New Year\u2019s resolutions. give up after the first week. These statistics are bleak but not surprising. Many New Year\u2019s pledges involve trying to establish new habits or conquer bad ones. And there\u2019s a lot of misinformation swirling around about how habits are formed and how they can be changed.",
        "What do an angry grizzly, a male entertainer and a pink have in common? They all stole the show in the movies they were in. Leading actors get so much credit when a movie is a success, but sometimes it\u2019s the supporting roles that really make the story. This year there were plenty of second bananas and bit parts who did just that. Here are some of the standouts.",
        "BEIRUT \u2014 Saudi Arabia on Saturday executed a prominent Shiite cleric who played a key role in protests against the kingdom\u2019s Sunni royal family, igniting sectarian tensions across the already inflamed region and jeopardizing a new burst of U. S. diplomacy aimed at tamping down conflicts in the Middle East. Sheikh Nimr Baqr 56, was among a group of 47 people put to death in 12 different cities around the country, either by firing squad or beheading, according to a statement from Saudi Arabia\u2019s Interior Ministry.",
        "Last month, The Washington Post reported that white nationalists have begun using Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as a recruitment tool. Now, the polarizing Republican presidential has become the recruitment fodder for another group of marginalized extremists. A propaganda video released by the affiliate includes a clip of Trump calling on the United States to bar Muslims from entering the country, according to news reports. Trump made the statement following the Islamic shootings in San Bernardino, Calif. last month.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 Since the Discovery Channel first hit the airwaves 30 years ago with an special on icebergs, the company has staged a surprising transformation to become the world\u2019s king of reality TV, broadcasting a dozen networks with hits such as \u201cSex Sent Me to the ER\u201d to 3 billion subscribers in 220 countries. That shift toward guilty pleasures netted the media giant ratings and tons of advertiser cash. But by pivoting its lenses from snow leopards to naked survivalists and child beauty pageanteers, Discovery began to lose something, too: the prestige it had earned in educational, TV.",
        "The stethoscope is having a crossroads moment. Perhaps more than at any time in its history, this ubiquitous tool of the medical profession is at the center of debate over how medicine should be practiced. In recent years, the sounds it transmits from the heart, lungs, blood vessels and bowels have been digitized, amplified, filtered and recorded. Four months ago, the Food and Drug Administration approved a stethoscope that can faithfully reproduce those sounds on a cellphone app thousands of miles away or send them directly to an electronic medical record.",
        "This is going to be brief. So, it\u2019s got to be blunt. This is precisely what Donald Trump, national GOP but second place in Iowa, told an Iowa crowd this week while stumping for votes. Just remember this you gotta remember, in all fairness, to the best of my knowledge, not too many evangelicals come out of Cuba, okay? Just remember that \u2026 just remember. Got that? Those are his words. A Cruz spokesperson has said camp Cruz is \u201dconfused\u201d by Trump\u2019s statement.",
        "Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders said Saturday that he raised more than $33 million for his primary campaign in the final quarter of 2015, just shy of the $37 million that Hillary Clinton reported a day earlier. The take of the Vermont senator, however, lags further behind Clinton\u2019s overall haul of $55 million for the past three months, which also included $18 million earmarked for the Democratic party \u2014 money that would help bolster her prospects in the general election. Sanders did not report raising any money for the party during the period.",
        "The Transportation Security Administration\u2019s new rules for screening passengers with its controversial scanners \u2014 which were quietly changed just before the busy holiday travel season \u2014 represent a significant policy reversal that could affect your next flight. Getting checked by the TSA\u2019s technology used to be entirely optional, allowing those who refused a scan to be subjected to a . In fact, many observers thought the agency installed the 740 body scanners in 160 airports with an understanding that no one would be forced to use them, ever.",
        "Dale Bumpers, an Arkansas Democrat who rose to prominence in the 1970s as a reformist governor emblematic of a new wave of Southern leaders and then served four terms in the U. S. Senate, where he was known for his oratorical skills and political independence, died Jan. 1 at his home in Little Rock. He was 90. The cause was complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease and a broken hip, said his son Bill Bumpers. A former trial lawyer in the Ozark foothills, Mr. Bumpers triumphed over a set of formidable Arkansas politicians, including Winthrop Rockefeller and J.",
        "If you think Janet Jackson and a wardrobe malfunction has to be involved to generate controversy over a halftime show, you obviously don\u2019t follow the of Stanford\u2019s marching band. For the third time in recent memory, the band angered much of the crowd by openly trolling the Cardinal\u2019s opponent during its Rose Bowl program. Just listen to these boos. The #Stanford band #FarmersOnly jab at Iowa is by far the most entertaining moment of the #RoseBowl thus far pic. twitter.",
        "There is a lot of bad poetry in the world, and sports poetry is wincingly bad. You wish more people would take the advice of Noel Coward, who said, \u201cIf you must write poetry, you probably shouldn\u2019t. \u201d But I wanted a poem, a basketball poem, for my friend Pat Summitt. That\u2019s how I came across Mary Karr\u2019s poem \u201cLoony Bin Basketball,\u201d which, strangely, is dedicated to Phil Jackson.",
        "There\u2019s a certain subset of Americans who absolutely and almost reflexively claim that anything they don\u2019t agree with and that anything they have not personally experienced cannot possibly be true. For these Americans, news is part of a grand conspiracy. And today, some of the biggest proponents of these ideas hold or are running for public office. Thank goodness for data and its capacity to reveal undeniable truths about American life. It can really cut a straight path through big, intricate political yarns that politicians have been known to tell.",
        "BEIRUT \u2014 Saudi Arabia severed relations with Iran on Sunday amid the furor that erupted over the execution by the Saudi authorities of a prominent Shiite cleric. Foreign Minister Adel told reporters in Riyadh that the Iranian ambassador to Saudi Arabia had been given 48 hours to leave the country, citing concerns that Tehran\u2019s Shiite government was undermining the security of the Sunni kingdom. Saudi Arabian diplomats had already departed Iran after angry mobs trashed and burned the Saudi embassy in Tehran overnight Saturday, in response to the execution of Sheikh Nimr Baqr earlier in the day.",
        "DERRY, N. H. \u2014 One day before former president Bill Clinton arrives in New Hampshire to campaign for his wife, Hillary Clinton, she was confronted with questions about allegations involving his sexual history at a town hall meeting in the state on Sunday. State Rep. Katherine \u2019Brien (R) repeatedly interrupted Clinton during the meeting, which was held in a middle school gymnasium. \u2019Brien has for years followed the former first lady, peppering her with questions about allegations of past sexual misconduct by Bill Clinton. The state lawmaker\u2019s outbursts startled an otherwise friendly town hall audience.",
        "It\u2019s 2016 (finally)! Iowa voters will head to their caucuses in four weeks. The country will pick a new president in about 10 months. It\u2019s all happening, people. Given all of that, it\u2019s time to revisit my rankings of the candidates who could be the Republican presidential nominee in November. It\u2019s a shrinking list but still far longer than that of the Democrats\u2019 side, where it\u2019s Hillary Clinton\u2019s race to lose (still). The candidate ranked No. 1 below is the most likely, as of now, to be the GOP nominee.",
        "An armed militia took over a building at a national wildlife refuge in Oregon late Saturday and vows to occupy the outpost for years to protest the federal government\u2019s treatment of a pair of ranchers facing prison time. The occupation of a portion of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge 30 miles southeast of Burns, Ore. followed a peaceful march for ranchers Dwight Hammond, 73, and Steven Hammond, 46, who are scheduled to report to federal prison in San Pedro, Calif. on Monday after being convicted of arson, according to the Oregonian.",
        "CHICAGO \u2014 Mayor Rahm Emanuel cut short a family vacation this past week and returned to a city in crisis: On the North Side, more than a dozen people stood outside his house, hurling insults. On the West Side, a close aide was punched and kicked while attending a prayer vigil for a police shooting victim. And all week long, there were protesters, haunting one of Emanuel\u2019s biggest political donors, haranguing his police force, beating a likeness of his face at City Hall.",
        "Seven years ago, I sat across from Farrah Fawcett in the living room of her Los Angeles condo. In what would be her last media interview before she died in 2009, the actress described her suspicion that an employee at UCLA Medical Center had shared details of her cancer treatment \u2014 and the setbacks along the way \u2014 with the National Enquirer. Whenever she sought treatment there, the tabloids were quick with a story, even if it wasn\u2019t right. \u201cI actually kept saying for months and months and months, \u2018This is coming from here,\u2019 \u201d Fawcett told me.",
        "If the Supreme Court follows the election returns, as the old saying goes, the 2016 election will set the court\u2019s path for a generation. When the next president is sworn in, three sitting justices \u2014 Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy \u2014 will be in their 80s; Stephen Breyer will be 78. These justices are yet statistics are against them: The average retirement age for a justice leaving the court since 1971 is just under 79. They may not be able to delay retirement until the political stars align or even until their replacements are confirmed.",
        "You probably heard about the Disneyland measles outbreak last year. One infected person is thought to have visited the theme park, and thanks in part to low immunization rates, 142 people in California and six other states got sick. It wasn\u2019t close to the worst recent measles outbreak in the United States, but because of its origin in the shadow of Cinderella\u2019s castle, it produced a crescendo of media and public concern about the larger problem of childhood vaccination rates, which have dipped slightly in some states.",
        "Oh, Jeb(! ). News came this past week that the former Florida governor was canceling $3 million in TV ad buys in the crucial states of Iowa and South Carolina, a concession to financial and political reality that has been a long time coming. Bush aides may have hoped to bury the news by dropping it during a holiday week when people are paying little attention to politics.",
        "LAST WINTER, bitter cold on the East Coast prompted Sen. James M. Inhofe ( .) to take a snowball onto the Senate floor in mockery of climate scientists. This winter, the weather is so warm that there are not two snowflakes in the Washington area for Mr. Inhofe to scrape together. Just as last winter\u2019s cold did not disprove global warming, this winter\u2019s warmth does not, in itself, establish that humans are raising Earth\u2019s average temperature. Rather, it is the trend that matters \u2014 and that is concerning.",
        "BILOXI, Miss. \u2014 minutes into his first speech of 2016, Donald Trump finally talked about the video. No, not that one. Trump spotted \u201dDiamond and Silk,\u201d the boisterous YouTube stars from North Carolina who had become occasional campaign surrogates on TV and at rallies. They\u2019d introduced him by asking the Mississippi audience to vote in the March 8 primary, slightly misstating the need to switch party registration (there is no party registration in the state) but delighting the crowd of 15, 000. Midway through his speech, after discussing how he felt surrounded by \u201dlove,\u201d Trump brought them back.",

All the New York Jets needed to secure a playoff berth was a win over their former coach, Rex Ryan and his new team, the Buffalo Bills. It would have been the perfect way to exorcise the previous era of futility by Gang Green in Gotham. Alas, it wasn\u2019t to be.",
        "ARLINGTON, Texas \u2014 It was a day for celebrating Washington Redskins records, giving key veterans some rest and later \u2014 only after securing a fourth consecutive victory that averted a season\u2019s sweep by their most reviled foe \u2014 looking ahead to the NFL playoff appearance no one saw coming. The Redskins turned the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 AT&T Stadium into their own playground Sunday, bolting to a lead before turning to backups to close out the regular season with a victory. In the view of many, Sunday\u2019s game was a meaningless formality, with little at stake for either team.",
        "TEL AVIV \u2014 On the sidewalk in front of the Simta Pub, pinned down by remembrance candles and not yet washed out by the rain, a handwritten note in English reads: \u201cIsrael was with Paris for the Bataclan. Today Paris is with Israel on Dizengoff Street. \u201d \u201cBataclan\u201d refers to the terror attack last November on a Paris theater.

The United Arab Emirates, meanwhile, recalled its ambassador from Tehran in a downgrading of ties to focus mainly on commercial affairs. Dubai is the base for many businesses.
