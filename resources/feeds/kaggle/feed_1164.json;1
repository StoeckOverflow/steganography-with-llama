        "The decision by a group of activists to seize a small, remote federal building in a corner of Oregon has roots that burrow into a lot of political and social threads. There are gun rights issues, religious overtones, broad strains of sentiment and even the tactics of the Occupy Wall Street movement.",
        "June 15, 2015 It is an oppressively humid day in South Florida and Jeb Bush has come home to declare his candidacy for president. The big crowd assembled at Miami Dade College is festive \u2014 and diverse, reflecting the culture of Miami that has shaped the former governor for decades and the kind of openness he believes his party needs to win the White House. Bush has had a difficult spring, his candidacy buffeted by criticism and wounds. But in many circles he is still seen as the politician to beat for the Republican nomination.",
        "With all the noise and bluster coming from the Republican campaign, suggesting dysfunction among the Republican candidates, the fact is, Hillary Clinton is the most miscast character in the 2016 race. This is shaping up to be a change election, and nothing about a Clinton candidacy offers change. Period. While Republicans are engaged in a noisy, boisterous process that is at the very least compelling to watch, the Democrats appear to be letting Clinton sleepwalk them into the doldrums of a campaign that will not be able to channel the emotions of the electorate.",
        "We\u2019ll be hearing a lot about the middle class in the coming months. That\u2019s one sure bet for 2016, as both parties compete for votes. What\u2019s less sure is whether we\u2019ll get an accurate assessment of the middle class\u2019s condition. By now, the conventional wisdom is familiar: The top 1 percent has skimmed most income gains for itself, producing decades of stagnant living standards for most Americans. Wall Street has slaughtered Main Street. Now comes a report from the Pew Research Center that paints a more complex picture. It\u2019s not that the Pew study contradicts all the conventional wisdom.",
        "In her superb New Yorker profile of Ford Foundation president Darren Walker, writer Larissa MacFarquhar tells us about his great uncle Daddy C. The Texan \u201csaw everything in terms of race. He said that white people would never allow a black person to succeed. \u201d This particular passage resonated with me because I had a relative or two give me that same admonition when I was growing up. And every time an African American of some prominence or wealth fell from grace, their slide became another page in the cautionary tale.",
        "The value of free advice is measured by what you pay for it, and Republicans don\u2019t usually ask me for mine. Nonetheless, the GOP\u2019s presidential race is one of the most fascinating political brawls in years. It\u2019s about to hit full stride, and I can\u2019t resist kibitzing. I know the leading candidates will take my guidance for what it\u2019s worth. E. J. Dionne writes about politics in a column and on the PostPartisan blog.",
        "As President Obama begins his final year in office, polls show that public confidence in his national security leadership has collapsed: Only 18 percent of Americans say the United States is winning the war on terrorism, and even a 59 percent majority of Democrats are dissatisfied with how Obama is prosecuting the fight against Islamist radicalism.

        "NEW YORK \u2014 A worldwide stock sent Wall Street on a roller coaster ride Monday, serving notice that investors are likely to endure a volatile year as economic growth slows globally and interest rates at home begin to rise. China helped trigger the day\u2019s turbulence after reporting yet another slowdown in its manufacturing sector on Monday, but investors are also growing concerned that increasing tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran could lead to higher oil prices and that the U. S. economy may not be strong enough to withstand such global upheaval.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s new campaign ad includes a scene straight out of Joe Arpaio\u2019s nightmares: A horde of people clambering over and down embankments to make their way across the border illegally. The scene: A terrifying documentation of what Trump has been warning us about, to be sure. You can easily find the location of where this happened on Google Earth, if you look. It\u2019s here: But as Politifact noted, there\u2019s a catch. That\u2019s not the southern border of the United States. It\u2019s the western border of a Spanish enclave in Morocco called Mellila.",

        "President Obama delivered a deeply personal and emotional appeal to the country to help curb gun violence on Tuesday at the White House. For Obama, who is often criticized for his overly clinical approach to heated issues, his tone sad and mad in relatively equal measure was remarkable. Toward the end of his remarks, remembering the first graders who were the victims of a mass shooting in Newtown, Conn. Obama even wept briefly a remarkable concession to emotion from this president.

        "THE MORNING PLUM: Today, President Obama will roll out his new executive actions on guns, and the action that is most likely to generate a lot of noisy controversy and criticism is the one designed to expand federal background checks to gun sales that were previously not covered by them. Yet, based on what we know now, it actually may prove to be a fairly modest change \u2014 both legally and in substantive terms. Here is how it works.

They\u2019ve been harping on the \u201cangry white males\u201d stereotype for years. They may be taken aback by findings that white women are angrier than white men, which is chalked up to women\u2019s empathy (they are angry on behalf of others, you see) rather than focus on the decline in male employment, in college attendance and the kangaroo court system that casts male college students as predators \u2014 without the niceties of due process.",
