It\u2019s the time of year when many Americans realize they are a little pudgier than they ought to be and resolve to slim down. In other words, it\u2019s a time for the gym industry.

        "Congressional Republicans made good Wednesday on a central campaign pledge from the 2014 midterms, delivering a bill repealing the health care reform law they loathe to President Obama\u2019s desk, forcing a certain veto. The bill passed 240 to 181, with one House Democrat supporting the bill and three Republicans opposing it, after passing the Senate 52 to 47 last month. Neither margin is large enough to override a veto. But House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said the vote would prompt the direct clash that Republican voters have long sought.",

        "The Donald Trump phenomenon ranks as the great political story of 2015 \u2014 and maybe 2016 \u2014 but could it simply be a subplot of a bigger story: what commentator David Frum, once a speechwriter for President George W. Bush, calls the Republican Party\u2019s \u201cinternal class war\u201d? Yes, argues Frum. His thesis is laid out in engrossing detail in the issue of the Atlantic, where he is a senior editor.

        "The issue of whether Ted Cruz is constitutionally eligible to be president could not be more bogus. He is. Case closed. I say this as someone who could scarcely be more concerned about the prospect of President Cruz. So concerned, in fact, that I have concluded, after much \u201cangsting\u201d that President Trump would be preferable, given that nightmare choice.
