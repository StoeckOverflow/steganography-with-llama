        "Every Republican of the type concerned with winning in November has been asking the question (at least internally): \u201cWhat if the worst happens?\u201d The worst does not mean the nomination of Ted Cruz, in spite of justified fears of political disaster. Cruz is an ideologue with a message perfectly tuned for a relatively small minority of the electorate. Uniquely in American politics, the senator from Texas has made his reputation by being roundly hated by his colleagues \u2014 apparently a prerequisite for a certain kind of conservative, but unpromising for an image makeover at his convention.",
        "Over the past two decades, the United States has approached the Middle East through its own conceptual frameworks: dictatorships vs. democracy, secularism vs. religion, order vs. chaos. But the most significant trend shaping the region today is something different: Sunnis vs. Shiites. That sectarian struggle now infects almost every aspect of the region s politics. It has confounded U. S. foreign policy and will continue to limit the ability of the United States, or any outside power, to stabilize the region. In his prescient book,  The Shia Revival",
        "Who says Donald Trump lacks subtlety? The way he\u2019s raising \u201cbirther\u201d questions about his chief rival for the nomination is worthy of Machiavelli. \u201cI\u2019d hate to see something like that get in his way,\u201d Trump said of the fact that Sen. Ted Cruz ( .) was born in Canada. Trump referred to the Constitution\u2019s provision that \u201cNo Person except a natural born Citizen\u201d \u2014 whatever that means \u2014 is eligible to be president.

        "THE MASS protests that began against Egypt\u2019s autocratic government five years ago this month were famously touched off by young people using Facebook and other social media. At that time, Facebook had 4. 7 million members in Egypt; today it has some 26 million, more than 30 percent of the country\u2019s population. No wonder that the latest authoritarian regime running the country is directing its repression at the Internet platform as the fifth anniversary of the revolution approaches.",
        "Much of the national security leadership of the Obama administration is flying to California to seek tech firms\u2019 help in figuring out how to thwart terrorists who use the Internet to recruit and radicalize people and to plan attacks, according to U.

        "TOKYO \u2014 Kim Jong Un turns 33 on Friday, and from the North Korean leader\u2019s perspective, he has plenty to celebrate: Everyone\u2019s talking about him again. After several years of being overshadowed by the more imminent threat of the Islamic State and jockeying with Iran for the title of scariest nuclear regime, North Korea is back on the international agenda. Governments around the world rushed to condemn Wednesday\u2019s nuclear test \u2014 regardless of whether it involved a hydrogen bomb, as Pyongyang claimed, or an atomic device in line with its three previous tests \u2014 and the U.

        "Here\u2019s how Ted Abela was getting his giddy on five days before the Washington Redskins kick off their unexpected appearance in the NFL postseason: He had lunch in a vacant parking lot. Abela, a season ticket holder, pulled into his usual Orange Lot space at FedEx Field on Tuesday just to commune with the empty asphalt. \u201cSometimes when I need a boost, I drive by,\u201d explained Abela, an engineer from Washington and lifelong Redskins fan. \u201cI\u2019m definitely getting ready. \u201d Hey, it may not be painting your body burgundy and gold and streaking through Dupont Circle.",
        "Congress and the White House are coming after your toothpaste, facial scrubs and body wash. Beginning in tiny plastic beads found in some bath and beauty products will be prohibited.

        "You know when someone \u201cjokes\u201d about something that actually makes you deeply insecure, and you\u2019re forced to laugh it off because it would be awkward to do anything else?

DeKalb District Attorney Robert James said Thursday that he will recommend a criminal grand jury indict Officer Robert Olsen on two counts of felony murder, two counts of violation of an officer\u2019s oath, aggravated assault and making a false statement. \u201cOur decision is that we\u2019re going forward on an indictment,\u201d James said.",
        "The federal government on Thursday told Americans not to worry so much about cholesterol in their diets, that lots of coffee is fine and that skipping breakfast is no longer considered a health hazard. The recommendations were part of a new \u201dDietary Guidelines for Americans,\u201d\u00c2 the influential nutrition advice book that, updated every five years, expresses official thinking about what constitutes a nutritious meal.

        "A great man once said: The arc of the moral universe is long, and it bends toward revenge. John McCain proved the power of revenge on Wednesday night when asked about his longtime nemesis Ted Cruz\u2019s eligibility to be president, despite being born in Canada. \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that,\u201d McCain said on the \u201dChris Merrill Show\u201d on Wednesday. \u201cI know it came up in my race because I was born in Panama, but I was born in the Canal Zone, which is a territory.",

        "When Heidi and Ted Cruz came to the Atlanta suburbs to campaign a few weeks ago, she perfectly played the role of political spouse: a loving gaze for her husband as he spoke, hands on the shoulders of their two daughters, beaming smiles for supporters.

        "When you dance with the devil, the choreography can get awkward. Ted Cruz this week made his latest appeal to America\u2019s nativist fringe by naming Rep. Steve King of Iowa as a national of his presidential campaign. King, called a \u201ccourageous conservative\u201d and \u201cincredible leader\u201d by Cruz, is the hardliner who spoke of Mexican immigrants having \u201ccalves the size of cantaloupes\u201d and who was a prominent birther.

        "Even as President Obama was holding a CNN town hall last night calling for gun reforms, Donald Trump \u2014 the man who hopes to succeed him in the White House \u2014 was promising a crowd at a Vermont rally that he would end gun free zones at schools. Make no mistake, this is another very important Trumpian moment. It raises the bar once again for Trump\u2019s GOP rivals for the nomination. That\u2019s because, if you take Trump\u2019s words at face value, he is not simply proposing to repeal the federal law that created gun free zones at schools.",
        "After 62 House votes to repeal Obamacare, Congress finally passed a bill it could send to President Obama\u2019s desk. That won\u2019t change anything, of course, given Obama\u2019s inevitable veto. Since it looks like we won\u2019t be getting rid of Obamacare anytime soon, maybe it\u2019s worth assessing how well the law is doing nearly six years after its passage.

        "The same infographic kept appearing in my Twitter feed again and again around Thanksgiving. The graphic, originally shared by Donald Trump, showed a series of statistics about race and gun deaths in 2015, alongside an image of a man with a handgun. Every single one of the statistics in the graphic was false. But here\u2019s the thing: The people I follow on Twitter weren\u2019t endorsing the bogus statistics \u2014 quite the opposite. News organizations shared the image along with links to their articles debunking it. Pundits shared the image to poke fun at Trump\u2019s credulity.",
        "The Obama administration is overhauling its faltering efforts to combat the online propaganda of the Islamic State and other terrorist groups, U. S. officials said, reflecting rising White House frustration with largely ineffective efforts so far to cut into ISIS\u2019s use of social media to draw recruits and incite attacks.

        "President Obama rolled out a package of executive actions on guns this week. The changes included clarifying rules meant to broaden the use of background checks by private sellers, allocating money for mental health treatment, and adding more staff at the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to help enforce existing regulations. The changes were modest in scope experts and even the NRA agreed that their overall impact would be small. That didn\u2019t stop Obama\u2019s critics from fiercely denouncing the proposals.

        "Global markets ended a dismal week with a whimper Friday, capping one of the worst starts to a trading year in history and exacerbating concerns that global economic turmoil will continue to rattle investors.

Upon his arrest, Scott D. Stockert, 49, of Dickinson, N. D. made a series of outlandish claims to officers: that he was Jesus Christ, that he was the son of John F.
