        "The hit didn\u2019t look that bad. The coach had seen his star defensive player withstand far worse. But still, there Chris Beranger was, laying on the turf after colliding with a teammate near the goal line. \u201cDiscombobulated,\u201d is the description that Sean McDonnell, coach of the University of New Hampshire\u2019s football team, uses when describing players in these moments. \u201cHe wanted to play still, and we said, \u2018No, you can\u2019t. \u201d That was the last down Beranger, who had suffered a concussion, would play. \u201cThe effects kept lingering and linger and lingering,\u201d McDonnell recalls.",
        "Somehow, the word \u201cgaffe\u201d doesn\u2019t quite describe Ben Carson\u2019s latest moment. His stumble on the stump in Iowa on Thursday was awkward, embarrassing, possibly painful \u2014 anything but funny. And it involved a school kid who \u2014 how to put this pleasantly? \u2014 perhaps in the view of his classmates does not shine as brightly as they do, and was called out for his shortcomings in front of 500 people at a campaign rally.

        "Evidence shows that most people who make it to the top 1 percent of income earners usually don\u2019t stay at the top for very long. But the person who wins the $800 million Powerball jackpot during Saturday night\u2019s drawing, assuming one person wins the entire pot, will have such a large pile of cash that they can create a steady cash flow of millions of dollars a year without taking much risk. \u201cWith this amount of money there\u2019s really no reason to be overly aggressive,\u201d said Jeffrey Carbone, managing partner and founding member of Cornerstone Financial Partners in Charlotte.",
        "Temporary work visas allow thousands of Mexicans to travel to the United States each year to work in carnivals. Carlos Barria of Reuters traveled to fairs in Virginia to photograph such workers. The visas allow foreigners to come to the United States for months or years at a time and then return to their home countries. This practice is not uncommon, and businesses owned by Republican presidential Donald Trump \u2014 who has railed against illegal Mexican immigrants \u2014 are among those that have hired such workers.",
        "LOS MOCHIS, Mexico \u2014 In the rain and darkness Friday morning, Mexican marines crept up in trucks with their lights out and jumped between rooftops on Boulevard Jiquilpan, surrounding a little white house in this coastal city where their country\u2019s fugitive, Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, was hiding inside. When the shooting started, neighbors woke terrified. Marines went door to door rousting people from their beds, desperately trying to keep the billionaire drug lord \u2014 who had escaped twice from federal prison \u2014 from slipping away again.

Both teenagers were new to campus in September 2012, and the pair quickly became friends through a shared appreciation of alternative rock bands such as Coheed and Cambria and the Silversun Pickups. Early on, Duffin sensed that Jackie was interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with him. Duffin valued her friendship but politely rebuffed Jackie\u2019s advances for more. Just days after he met her, Duffin said, he was goaded into a text message conversation with a .",

        "North Korea sometimes seems less of a place than an idea or an absurdist fantasy. The latest New Yorker depicts Kim Jong Un on its cover as a child playing with toy missiles. What other world leader gets this treatment? What other country is so alien, so downright weird, that it celebrates the anniversary of its independence by creating its own time zone? What other country could prompt U. S. intelligence officials to seriously speculate that a nuclear test was retaliation for disrespecting a pop group? What other country has a pop group?",

It may be the second largest in the world, yet it remains opaque and misunderstood. Here are five common misconceptions. 1. China\u2019s stock market losses reflect an ailing economy. The dramatic declines in the Shanghai Composite Index this past week were linked to a report that the manufacturing sector is contracting and to broader concerns about China\u2019s economy.",

If campaigns are always about the future, the 2016 one points to a country that could end this year even more divided against itself than it was after the 2012 election. The year 2015 will long be remembered as the year of Donald Trump, all the more so because of the unexpectedly strong response his candidacy set off. Other Republican candidates once hoped they could ignore the meaning of Trump\u2019s appeal and ride along their own track.",

With the Iowa caucuses just three weeks away, the ardent conservatives who buoyed Carson\u2019s Republican candidacy from the start remain unsure whether they will caucus for the retired neurosurgeon. Many of them have been courted away by Sens.

His conclusion: Kim Jong Un\u2019s top priority is to improve the economy, so he needed to advertise his country\u2019s technology to potential customers such as Iran. This kind of analysis is Fujimoto\u2019s these days.

        "During a rally in Iowa on Friday evening, Ted Cruz made a joke that went over fine with his audience but was less popular once the wider world caught wind. Replying to a woman who asked him about holding someone accountable for the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi in 2012, Cruz said that she was \u201dexactly right.\u201d He criticized President Obama and of State Hillary Clinton for \u201dengag[ing] in deception\u201d on the matter.
