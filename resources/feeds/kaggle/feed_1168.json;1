        "KABUL \u2014 When representatives of four nations meet on Monday to plan peace talks aimed at ending nearly four decades of fighting in Afghanistan, the most important figure is almost sure to be absent. Akhtar Mohammad Mansour, the leader of the Taliban, will likely remain in hiding when U. S. Afghan, Pakistani and Chinese officials meet in Islamabad to lay the groundwork for future talks. Nonetheless, his shadow will hang over the proceedings.",
        "Sen. Marco Rubio ( .) said he stands by a 2004 bill he in the Florida legislature to provide tuition to undocumented immigrants, saying it was \u201dnarrowly\u201d drafted and set specific eligibility criteria. Rubio said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201dThis Week\u201d that he \u201dabsolutely\u201d stands by the proposal. It required undocumented immigrants to have a certain GPA, to be a graduate of a Florida high school and to have been living in the United States for a certain period to qualify for tuition, he said.",
        "Close your eyes for a minute and imagine it\u2019s Feb. 10. In the past nine days, Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) has beaten his Democratic presidential challenger Hillary Clinton in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. There won\u2019t be another vote for 10 more days (Nevada) and then it\u2019ll be another week until South Carolina, the last of the big four early states, votes. That scenario would be a total nightmare for Clinton. Period. It\u2019s also a lot more likely to go from fantasy to reality than most people \u2014 including most establishment Democrats \u2014 understand.",
        "From the moment Donald Trump was named a captain for his senior year at New York Military Academy, he ordered the officers under his command to keep strict discipline. Shoes had to be shined. Beds had to be made. Underclassmen had to spring to attention. Then, a month into Trump\u2019s tenure in the fall of 1963, came an abrupt change. The tall, confident senior with a shock of blond hair was removed from that coveted post atop A Company and transferred to a new job on the school staff \u2014 another prestigious assignment, but one with no command responsibilities.",
        "The scandal that rocked the lottery organization behind Powerball has done little to hold back interest in the game. In fact, with the jackpot soaring to world levels \u2014 standing at an estimated $1. 3 billion as of Sunday night \u2014 Powerball hysteria is sweeping the United States. Stores across the country sold more tickets and saw much longer lines than usual before Saturday\u2019s drawing, which did not produce a single ticket matching all six Powerball numbers. The jackpot rises after each drawing that fails to produce a winner. Who wants to be a billionaire? #Powerball #letyourselfplay pic. twitter.",
        "A husband and wife in Sarasota, Fla. have been accused of child abuse after they allegedly told authorities that they routinely tied up and locked their daughter inside a playhouse. In an affidavit cited by WTSP, the foot playhouse was described by a detective as a \u201cglorified cage. \u201d \u201cShe wasn\u2019t allowed to leave the playhouse to use the restroom,\u201d Sheriff\u2019s Lt. Joe Giasone told WTSP. \u201cShe\u2019d have to do all that inside.",
        "President Obama has invited a Syrian refugee to sit in the first lady\u2019s box for the State of the Union address on Tuesday, the White House said Sunday. The symbolic gesture to invite Refaai Hamo, 55, who fled Syria in 2013 and was cleared by U. S. authorities to arrive in Detroit last month, comes as the president has sought to counter Republican calls to bar Muslim refugees in the wake of terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif. Hamo, a scientist, will sit in Michelle Obama\u2019s box along with other guests who represent the president\u2019s priorities.",
        "For African American travelers, much of the U. S. could be a hateful and dangerous place, even into the 1960\u2019s. Jim Crow laws across the South mandated that restaurants, hotels, pool halls and parks strictly separate whites and blacks. Lynchings kept blacks in fear of mob violence. And there were thousands of \u201csundown towns,\u201d including in northern states like Indiana, Illinois, Minnesota and Michigan, which barred blacks after dark, an unofficial rule reinforced by the threat of violence.",
        "A majority of the Supreme Court on Monday seemed prepared to hand a significant defeat to organized labor and side with a group of California teachers who claim their free speech rights are violated when they are forced to pay dues to the state\u2019s teachers union. By their questioning at oral argument, the court\u2019s conservatives appeared ready to junk a precedent that allows unions to collect an \u201cagency fee\u201d from nonmembers to support activities for members and nonmembers alike.",
        "Under the current Democratic president, the United States just had one of its best years for job creation since the 1990s. More than 17 million people have gained access to health insurance. Gas prices are down, crime has dropped and graduation is at an high. But none of that has truly become a rallying cry for those in President Obama\u2019s party seeking to succeed him. Americans are deeply anxious about both the nation\u2019s security and their personal finances. Polls show that only of them think the country is on the right track.",
        "If life is effectively an endless series of photocopies, as DNA is transcribed and passed on from one being to the next, then evolution is the game of waiting for the copier to get it wrong. Too wrong, and you\u2019ll live burdened by a maladaptive mutation or genetic disorder. Worse, you might never live at all. But if the flaw is wrong in exactly the right way, the incredible can happen: disease resistance, sharper eyesight, swifter feet, big brains, better beaks for Darwin\u2019s finches.",
        "MEXICO CITY \u2014 Before dawn on Friday, an elite unit of Mexican marines raided a white house along a residential street in the Mexican coastal town of Los Mochis, in pursuit of their target: drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \u201dEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n. When they entered, the video shows, they encountered several of Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s henchmen, and a gun battle ensued. The video first appeared on Univision and was subsequently obtained by The Washington Post. The video shows a portion of the gunfight in which marines appear to be firing through a barred window and an open door.",
        "A huge sense of relief washed over Brad Chesivoir when a Maryland emergency room doctor told him the good news: He had not suffered a heart attack or a stroke, as he had feared. Instead he was being discharged with a diagnosis of headache, although doctors weren\u2019t sure of its cause. Several hours earlier, on the day after Thanksgiving 2013, Chesivoir\u2019s family had summoned an ambulance to their Montgomery County home after he became suddenly weak and unable to walk.",
        "\u201cKill me,\u201d moaned Golden Globe host Ricky Gervais, far past the of Sunday\u2019s schlocky telecast of Hollywood\u2019s most meaningless (but by reputation ) awards show. But the thing is, nobody really wanted to kill him for anything he said during the show \u2014 and only in this day and age could that could be seen as a disappointing breach of contract. We\u2019ve developed a bad habit in our culture now, bleeding into our politics and our civil discourse as well as some of our awards shows: We demand the worst, so we get the worst.",
        "When President Obama tearfully announced his executive actions on guns at the White House recently, he was able to surround himself with victims of gun violence who support his efforts. But at a CNN town hall meeting last week, the president came face to face with victims of gun violence who don\u2019t agree with his efforts to limit their gun rights \u2014 and who, politely and respectfully, spoke truth to power. Marc Thiessen writes a weekly column for The Post on foreign and domestic policy and contributes to the PostPartisan blog.",
        "Today, the Supreme Court will be hearing oral arguments in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, one of the most important cases they\u2019ll decide this year. The plaintiffs in the case are teachers who don\u2019t want to have to pay fees to the union that bargains on their behalf. But in truth, this case is around 10 percent about teachers unions in particular and 90 percent about the larger conservative effort to destroy collective bargaining and union representation as features of the American workplace.",
        "Just in time for the 2016 election, the Roberts Court has found yet another way to stack the deck in favor of the rich. By all appearances at Monday\u2019s argument, the five justices are ready to upend a precedent guiding labor relations in favor of a new approach that will deplete unions\u2019 finances and reduce their political clout. The case, from California, involves arcane issues of \u201cagency fees\u201d and member but make no mistake: This is about campaign finance, and, in particular, propping up the Republican Party. Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation\u2019s capital.",
        "The writer is a professor at and past president of Harvard University. He was treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 and an economic adviser to President Obama from 2009 through 2010 Often markets are volatile at the end of the year \u2014 as many traders go on holiday and those with losses unload them \u2014 and then settle down as a new year begins. Not this year. U. S. and European markets closed significantly lower on Friday after a very rough week despite a very strong U. S. jobs report.",
        "Each week, In Theory takes on a big idea in the news and explores it from a range of perspectives. This week we\u2019re talking about executive power. Need a primer? Catch up here. Adrian Vermeule is the John H. Watson professor of law at Harvard Law School. His next book on executive power, \u201cLaw\u2019s Abnegation: From Law\u2019s Empire to the Administrative State,\u201d will be published in September.

        "American conservatives are claiming a \u201dwe told you so\u201d moment. From Republican Donald Trump to evangelical Franklin Graham, many on the political right are pointing to the shocking wave of sexual assaults in Germany as a justification of their concerns of Muslim immigration. It\u2019s now clear that what police first described as a \u201drelaxed atmosphere\u201d in Cologne, Germany, on New Year\u2019s Eve was anything but: Of the more than 500 criminal complaints related to incidents near the city\u2019s main train station that night, roughly 40 percent include allegations of sexual assault, including at least two rapes.",
        "The United States has repatriated a Saudi prisoner held for nearly 14 years at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the Pentagon said Monday, the latest signal of an intensifying effort to shutter the military prison before President Obama steps down. In a statement, the Pentagon said that Muhammad Abd Awn whom U. S. officials describe as an recruiter and fighter, had arrived in Saudi Arabia, making him the fourth prisoner to be released from Guantanamo this year.",
        "LAS VEGAS \u2014 Maria Herrera, a retired casino housekeeper, feels no affinity for Marco Rubio even as he aims to make history as the first Hispanic president of the United States. As she explained: \u201cHe\u2019s Cuban. I\u2019m Mexican. \u201d \u201cRubio says things that are not good for Mexicans,\u201d Herrera said, adding that she supports Hillary Clinton. \u201cI would never vote for him just because he\u2019s Latino.",
        "George Washington University\u2019s president announced Monday that the honorary degree presented to Bill Cosby in the 1990s would be revoked, the latest college to back away from the actor and comedian who has been accused of sexual assault by dozens of women and was charged last month in a case. [Bill Cosby charged with sexual assault] GW\u2019s decision was an from the position the university took in the fall, so President Steven Knapp explained in a letter to the campus community why he decided to join the list of institutions that have made similar decisions regarding Cosby.",
        "Almost 75 years after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the remains of five U. S. sailors who perished when their battleship was sunk there have been identified, the Pentagon said Monday. The five men, who were exhumed last year from their graves in Hawaii and examined in special military laboratories, were among 429 sailors and Marines killed when the USS Oklahoma was torpedoed and capsized. They had been buried as \u201cunknowns.",
        "The Powerball \u2014 all $1. 3 billion of this week\u2019s jackpot \u2014 is evil. Lotteries prey on the poor and the elderly. They\u2019re rigged, hyped and glorified. The winners almost always end up as losers. But I bought four tickets over the weekend. I\u2019m weak. So let the dreaming begin: The Lego Death Star? Done, boys. I\u2019ll even throw in the Millennium Falcon. A Ford crew cab truck with a hardtop bed cover? Done, husband. How about we lift that baby and throw some on it, too? See, our household\u2019s Powerball fantasies are pretty modest.",
        "It\u2019s been a bumpy ride for the European Space Agency\u2019s Philae lander. The little robot made history in November 2014, making the first controlled landing onto the surface of a comet. An unstable threw the lander into shade, preventing it from fully charging its batteries. Just days later, the mission team lost contact. While the Rosetta orbiter that dropped Philae has continued to analyze comet the mission team has periodically tried to rouse the sleeping lander.",
        "DES MOINES \u2014 They draw the biggest crowds of the 2016 campaign, and to hear some people talk, Donald Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders have tapped into the same vein of anger coursing through the electorate. Just don\u2019t tell that to the people who come to see them. \u201cI don\u2019t see any similarity whatsoever,\u201d said Bob Edmonson, a retiree who was waiting for a Trump rally to begin in Ottumwa, Iowa, on Saturday afternoon. \u201cBernie\u2019s a socialist. He\u2019s been in lock step with the Washington politicians for how many years now. He\u2019s not going to change a thing.",
        "Lake Erie Monster. (David Sandford) photographer David Sandford has been making pictures for more than 18 years. During that time, he has mostly been able to pay his bills by shooting sports. But his true passion lies in making photographs about anything to do with water. Sandford explains what draws him to water: \u201cOceans and lakes beckon me. Since I was a kid, I\u2019ve loved to be on, in or around water. I\u2019m fascinated by the sheer raw power and force of it, captivated by the graceful movement of a wave and mesmerized by light dancing across it.",
        "Two small U. S. Navy vessels are in Iranian custody, but their crews will be released promptly, the Pentagon said Tuesday. However, FARS, an Iranian news agency, said that the ten sailors had been arrested and were suspected of \u201csnooping. \u201d Two U. S. naval craft were en route from Kuwait to Bahrain when they disappeared from the Navy\u2019s scopes. The incident marks the latest between Iranian and U. S. crews. In late December, Iranian gunboats fired unguided missiles almost 1, 000 yards away from the aircraft carrier the USS Harry S. Truman. [These are the U. S.",
        "AMES, Iowa \u2014 A newly aggressive Hillary Clinton emerged here this week and her campaign took on fresh urgency as polls suddenly showed the Democratic presidential in real danger of losing the first two primary contests to insurgent rival Bernie Sanders. Here in Ames, Clinton launched her sharpest attacks yet by ripping into Sanders on issues such as health care and gun control. She portrayed the senator from Vermont as naive and his proposals as unrealistic \u2014 and, seeking to undermine the central argument of his candidacy, alleged that he could not be trusted to take on entrenched interests."
