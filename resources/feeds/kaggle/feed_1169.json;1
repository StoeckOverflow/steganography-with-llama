        "To the Powerball crowd, Lady\u2019s Liquors is a lucky store. Two years ago, the Southern Maryland booze purveyor sold a winning $414 million Mega Millions ticket. Lady\u2019s Liquors has been cashing in on that ever since, advertising the accomplishment on its marquee sign to players looking for a touch of magic. \u201cThey think we are the ones who can make it happen,\u201d owner Tina Patel said. \u201cThey believe the store is special. \u201d With the Powerball jackpot topping $1. 5 billion \u2014 the largest lottery prize in U.

        "President Obama will appeal to Americans to \u201cfix our politics\u201d by rejecting partisan distrust in his final State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, trying to strike an optimistic tone while admitting \u2014 if only tacitly his 2008 vision of a more unified and hopeful country has not come true. \u201cThe future we want \u2014 opportunity and security for our families; a rising standard of living and a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids \u2014 all that is within our reach,\u201d Obama will say, according to excerpts released by the White House prior to his addressing Congress.",
        "Mary Brigid McManamon is a constitutional law professor at Widener University\u2019s Delaware Law School. Donald Trump is actually right about something: Sen. Ted Cruz ( .) is not a citizen and therefore is not eligible to be president or vice president of the United States. The Constitution provides that \u201cNo person except a natural born Citizen . . . shall be eligible to the Office of President. \u201d The concept of \u201cnatural born\u201d comes from common law, and it is that law the Supreme Court has said we must turn to for the concept\u2019s definition.",
        "Bill Clinton\u2019s sexual misadventures have never quite vanished as a national story. But in recent weeks, Republican presidential contender Donald Trump has called renewed attention to them, and Juanita Broaddrick, who in 1999 said Bill Clinton had raped her in 1978, has renewed those allegations. Both because the case is past the statute of limitations in Arkansas and because Hillary Clinton is running for president now on a platform that includes greater support for rape victims, the headlines have become more about Hillary Clinton than about her husband, the man who actually has been accused of misconduct.",
        "For Democrats who might be rooting for Donald Trump, thinking he would be easy to beat in November, I have some advice: Be careful what you wish for. In his campaign, or rampage, Trump has done more than take a sledgehammer to the Republican Party. He almost seems to be reinventing politics in a way that makes both major parties seem hidebound, sluggish and concerned mostly with \u2014 which, in fact, they are. Eugene Robinson writes a column on politics and culture, contributes to the PostPartisan blog, and hosts a weekly online chat with readers.",
        "The smart Beltway money has suddenly decided, based on a handful of polls, that we\u2019ve got ourselves a real race on the Democratic side. A new Monmouth University poll finds Bernie Sanders leading Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire among likely Democratic primary voters by . Meanwhile, a new Quinnipiac poll finds Sanders leading Clinton in Iowa by among likely Democratic . A new Public Policy Polling survey puts Clinton up in Iowa by but that\u2019s a tightening, and the polling averages clearly suggest a tightening in Iowa as well. So Sanders may well be surging.",
        "This lame, thankless chore comes immediately after the leader of the free world holds forth on his vision of where things are and where they are going in this country. He and his speechwriters spend months crafting prose they hope will lift spirits in times of stress or trauma or hold them aloft in times of peace and plenty. And he does it from the well of the House of Representatives. You can\u2019t beat that pageantry. The applause. The ovations. That stirring announcement from the sergeant at arms. https: . archive. : . vine. .",
        "Vice President Biden said in an interview broadcast Monday night that President Obama offered him financial help when his son Beau Biden was suffering from cancer. In the interview with CNN, the vice president said he had told Obama over one of their regular private lunches that if his son Beau were forced to step down his position as Delaware\u2019s attorney general and lose his income because of the brain cancer that ultimately killed him, the vice president and his wife Jill would have to sell their home to pay for Beau\u2019s medical expenses.",
        "ISTANBUL \u2014 A suicide bomber believed to be linked to the Islamic State struck the historic heart of Istanbul on Tuesday, killing at least 10 people in what would be the group\u2019s first major attack on Turkey\u2019s vital tourism industry. The bombing, which injured 15 others, took place in the shadow of the city\u2019s famous Blue Mosque, which draws visitors from around the world. Most of the victims were German nationals, Turkish officials said.",

        "Many people are overwhelmed by the responsibility of having to amass enough cash for retirement. Only about half of workers participate in a workplace retirement savings plan, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And once they have a retirement account, few people ever do then math on how much money they\u2019ll need to be able to retire or check if they\u2019re on pace to get there.",
        "The Supreme Court found Florida\u2019s unique system of imposing a death sentence unconstitutional on Tuesday, saying it gives power to judges that is rightfully reserved for juries. The decision united the court\u2019s liberals and most of its conservatives, who voted 8 to 1 against the system employed by a state that\u2019s among the leaders in imposing capital punishment. Florida has nearly 400 inmates on death row.",
        "It\u2019s the theory of Trumpmania. President Obama, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and others have speculated that working class whites are signing on to Donald Trump and his inflammatory rhetoric out of a deepening anxiety over their place in the 21st century American economy. Some political scientists, however, say antagonism toward immigrants is being driven by a more primal instinct: mistrust of outsiders \u2014 or even racial prejudice, either of the conscious or unconscious variety. A body of academic research has tried to deconstruct why some Americans are skeptical about immigrants. Are they driven by policy concerns, about economics, or security?",
        "For the first time since 1974, nobody reached the top of the world\u2019s tallest mountain last year \u2014 a period during which tragedy, government actions and plain old bad luck made Mount Everest virtually unconquerable. The news was confirmed for The Washington Post by climbers, longtime Everest observers and the Himalayan Database, which compiles records for expeditions into the Nepalese Himalaya.",
        "The Science Museum, London, opened an exhibition in September 2015 marking the 200th anniversary of the birth of photographer Julia Margaret Cameron ( ). Cameron was a late bloomer to photography, beginning her career at age 48 in 1863 after receiving a camera as a gift from her eldest daughter. Cameron\u2019s photographic technique was to purposefully utilize a lack of sharp focus and technical faults to evoke emotion and energy, despite harsh criticism from the press.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s new barrage against Bernie Sanders, the Democratic presidential primary opponent she has all but ignored through most of her campaign, is having an effect \u2014 though probably not the one she intended. Sanders\u2019s underdog campaign said it is seeing a surge of contributions as a direct result of the new attention it is getting from the Democratic with money coming in at a clip nearly four times the average daily rate reported in the last quarter of 2015.",
        "Secretary of State John F. Kerry spoke at least five times yesterday by telephone with his Iranian counterpart in intense diplomacy that led to the release Wednesday morning of 10 American sailors who were picked up and detained overnight when their small ships strayed into Iranian waters the day before. Rapid resolution of the incident appeared to end a potential flash point just as Iran and world powers moved toward implementation of a nuclear deal expected within the next few days. Kerry thanked Iran for cooperating in the release.",
        "In his State of the Union speech, President Obama called on lawmakers and the public to take a number of steps \u201dto change the system to reflect our better selves\u201d for \u201da better politics.\u201d The top item on that list was to end partisan gerrymandering: \u201dwe have to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters, and not the other way around,\u201d Obama said. In most states, state legislatures draw the district boundaries that determine how many delegates the state sends to the U. S.",
        "The most venomous part of the Republican Party has seized control of the national dialogue. This forced President Obama to use his final State of the Union message on Tuesday to battle against intolerance, anger, pessimism and despair. Even more tellingly, the Republican designated to reply to him, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, effectively joined hands with a man she otherwise criticized. She implored her party to reject \u201cthe siren call of the angriest voices.",
        "President Obama\u2019s final State of the Union address was part stump speech for the third term he\u2019ll never have and part melancholy addendum to the first speech that propelled him to national attention. Far more than with George W. Bush in 2008, Bill Clinton in 2000 or Ronald Reagan in 1988, the roiling presidential campaign was an unmentioned but omnipresent subtext of the speech. While Obama\u2019s predecessors referred only glancingly to the impending election, his Republican replacements were the unnamed but unmistakable targets of his critique.",
        "In his final State of the Union address, President Obama returned to the optimism that he personified in his first campaign \u2014 but applied it only to America. For the rest of the world, Obama was pessimistic, even fatalistic. It is as if the only way he can process his failure in Syria, and the vast humanitarian catastrophe still unfolding there, is to convince himself that failure was inevitable and will be repeated many times.

        "After President Obama promised to \u201ctry to make\u201d his last State of the Union \u201cshorter\u201d and failed, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley mercifully kept her response on behalf of the Republican Party short. And in one sense, it was a surprisingly successful speech. State of the Union responses typically meet with derision or are forgotten immediately, and that\u2019s if they don\u2019t effectively kill the respondent\u2019s national prospects (see: Bobby Jindal). But many Republicans and even some Democrats reacted positively to Haley\u2019s speech, with many suggesting that she made a strong case to be the no.",
        "For years, I ve lamented the debilitating caution that has hobbled President Obama. Then, Wednesday morning, I spent an hour with White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough.

View Archive Facebook Google+ RSS The morning after Obama s State of the Union address \u201d a surprisingly lively affair \u201d McDonough met for an early breakfast with reporters at the St. Regis hotel.",
        "Now let us praise laundry lists. Every year at State of the Union time, the president and his staff say the speech will not include them. But the laundry won\u2019t keep track of itself. The union is varied and expansive, and so are the responsibilities of its chief executive. Enumerating accomplishments and objectives amounts to lists, which Obama had in plenty Tuesday night. The interesting thing is why this particular laundry was chosen.",
        "From the start, people at the Al Jazeera America network knew they faced an uphill battle for ratings and acceptance. It wasn\u2019t just that they were taking on entrenched competitors such as CNN and Fox News with an unfamiliar, foreign brand name. Insiders knew that it would take ample distribution, lots of promotion, and audience goodwill to establish a foothold. On Wednesday, Al Jazeera America\u2019s owners acknowledged they had achieved none of those things.",
        "MANCHESTER, N. H. \u2014 Lindsay is the kind of voter the Republican Party is desperate to rouse. She is white and from Vermont. She fears the changes happening all around her. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to have friends,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause everyone seems to disagree. \u201d She drove here on a cold January night to make phone calls on Ted Cruz\u2019s behalf.

        "U. S. stocks sold off Wednesday in a sign that investors are still fretting over low oil prices and are jittery after watching markets get off to a tumultuous start this year. The Dow Jones industrial average fell365 points, or 2. 2 percent, to 16151. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index closed down 2. 5 percent for the day, officially entering correction territory, which is defined as being off more than 10 percent from the most recent high.

        "For the first time since 1978, a named tropical weather system has formed in the Atlantic Ocean. At 4 p. m. today, the National Hurricane Center announced Subtropical Storm Alex had developed over the eastern Atlantic Ocean. A subtropical storm is one that exhibits a combination of tropical and characteristics. Positioned 785 miles of the Azores, Alex has maximum sustained winds of 50 mph.

        "The widow of a man killed in last month\u2019s mass shooting in San Bernardino has filed claims seeking $58 million in damages on behalf of herself and her three minor children. Renee Wetzel, whose husband, Michael, was among the 14 people fatally shot during an attack at the Inland Regional Center last month, filed four separate claims with San Bernardino County in late December, records show.
