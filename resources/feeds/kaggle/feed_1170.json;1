        "The \u201cundercard\u201d Republican debate has begun Thursday evening, with former tech executive Carly Fiorina denouncing both GOP Donald Trump and Democratic Hillary Rodham Clinton as examples of \u201ccrony capitalism. \u201d The difference, Fiorina said, was that Clinton works inside government to benefit cronies in the private sector, while \u201cDonald Trump sits outside government and rakes in billions buying people like Hillary Clinton,\u201d Fiorina said. This is the smallest \u2014 and most desperate \u2014 undercard yet, with three candidates who\u2019ve tasted success in the past but are now far behind with the first votes just weeks away.",
        "Seven candidates. Eighteen days before the Iowa caucuses. Donald Trump\u2019s continued dominance. The stakes are high, and the political drama is expected to be as well in Republicans\u2019 sixth main presidential debate, held in South Carolina on Thursday night. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the six big issues expected to be in play: 1.

        "This New York Times story could not have come at a worse time for Sen. Ted Cruz ( .) who had already been knocked by Donald Trump, is falling in his state of Iowa and is being attacked as a slick politician who won\u2019t level with voters: As Ted Cruz tells it, the story of how he financed his upstart campaign for the United States Senate four years ago is an endearing example of loyalty and shared sacrifice between a married couple.",
        "With the GOP presidential debate tonight likely to broadcast the ugliness of Trumpism to the nation once again, House Speaker Paul Ryan has given an interesting interview to USA Today in which he attacks Barack Obama for having \u201cdegraded the presidency\u201d with his State of the Union speech. Ryan\u2019s comments are noteworthy because they unwittingly illuminate the broader dilemma that more Republicans face as they grapple with the rise of Trumpism among their voters and what it means for the party in 2016 \u2014 dynamics that will be on full display tonight.",
        "What boxer Sonny Liston\u2019s manager said of him (Sonny had his good points, the trouble was his bad points) is true of Marco Rubio. His strengths include intelligence, articulateness and, usually, cheerfulness. His misjudgments involve, in ascending order of importance, the Senate immigration bill of 2013, sugar, Libya and S . 590. Together these reveal a recurring penchant for undertakings. Rubio\u2019s retreat, under withering political heat, from the immigration bill was undignified but not reprehensible. The bill had 1, 197 pages because the Affordable Care Act had not slaked the congressional appetite for \u201ccomprehensive\u201d solutions to complex problems.",
        "Ever since reading Sean Penn\u2019s article for Rolling Stone about his meeting with El Chapo, I have been unable to get his writing style out of my head.

Fortunately, Sean Penn had other people he wanted to meet and write about for free, and was generous enough to let me run the following.

        "The Episcopal Church has been suspended from full participation in the Anglican Communion, the world\u2019s Christian denomination, after years of heated debates over human sexuality and other issues. The Anglican Communion of national churches, which includes the Episcopal Church in the United States, have been affiliated for centuries, but they have struggled to stay unified amid divisions.

        "Carly Fiorina has dwindled to irrelevance in the Republican primary field, as illustrated by her demotion to the undercard debate.
