But as the nation reflects on the struggle for racial equality this Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the capital\u2019s mostly forgotten history of integration is worth remembering. Washington was a key civil rights battleground, especially in the years before the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark 1954 school desegregation decision in Brown v. Board of Education.

It\u2019s a picture of flowers and the ocean and would be lovely to look at if the picture hanger didn\u2019t show above the top. I could ask Steve to fix it, but I\u2019m afraid of becoming a clich\u00e9, the nagging wife. And the truth is, I once would have fixed it myself.
