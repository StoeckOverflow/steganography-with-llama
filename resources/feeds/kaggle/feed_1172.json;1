        "misunderstandings over whether Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian\u2019s mother, Mary, and wife, Yeganeh, were on the flight manifest, complicated by flight crew rest rules, contributed to delays in the departure of the Americans flown out of Iran on Sunday, Secretary of State John F.

        "CHARLESTON, S. C. Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders would raise income taxes across the board and by substantially more on high earners to pay for an ambitious plan, under details released Sunday night. The senator from Vermont said the plan, which was outlined before a Democratic debate here, would ultimately save most families thousands of dollars a year on costs. But Sanders would pay for it largely through higher income taxes.",
        "The last time Democrats met on a debate stage, it was a Saturday before Christmas, and we wrote that Hillary Clinton was sitting comfortably atop the field. Now, as Democrats get ready to debate for a fourth time, in South Carolina on Sunday in the middle of a holiday weekend there are signs Clinton\u2019s lead is evaporating. A Quinnipiac University poll out Tuesday shows her rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) ahead in Iowa by five points. A Selzer & Company poll showed Clinton up just two down from wider previous leads.",

I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not doing it.",
        "LONDON \u2014 In nearly a millennium of history, the Palace of Westminster has played host to kings and queens, endured Nazi bombing raids and showed the world how a people could govern themselves through representative democracy. But it has never seen a day quite like the one expected on Monday, when the building\u2019s cold stone walls will echo with a parliamentary debate over whether to ban from Britain the leading Republican contender for president of the United States. It will be a strange moment for politics on both sides of the Atlantic.",
        "BAGHDAD \u2014 U. S. and Iraqi authorities are searching for three Americans reported missing from a neighborhood in Iraq\u2019s capital, Baghdad, officials said Sunday.

But while the booster stage hit the platform softly, it fell over when one of the landing legs didn\u2019t lock in place correctly, the company said.",
        "Forecast models have converged on the idea that a significant storm will impact the area between next Thursday night and Sunday. If they are right, it could bring us our first meaningful winter weather event of the season. There is some chance this could produce heavy amounts of snow on parts of the region. Next chance of accumulating snow: January Percent chance of at least one inch: 30 percent (low probability mainly due to number of days away) Not unsurprisingly six days out, a boatload of uncertainty still exists concerning the storm details.",

        "LONDON \u2014 A debate was held Monday in the British Parliament over whether to ban U. S. Republican presidential Donald Trump from visiting the United Kingdom. The debate, which was started by an online petition that described Trump\u2019s comments about Muslims as \u201chate speech,\u201d did not produce any binding decisions. Authority to ban someone from the country rests with the home secretary, not with Parliament. But the exchange gave British lawmakers an unusual chance to weigh in directly on U. S. politics. Here are the latest updates from the debate at the Palace of Westminster.",
        "THE BIG IDEA: The final Democratic debate before the Iowa caucuses was mostly about Bernie Sanders. Hillary Clinton often sounded like an underdog, as she attacked the Vermont senator for on guns, proposing an unrealistic plan and admitting that he would raise taxes on the middle class. The former secretary of state closely linked herself with Barack Obama, praising the president repeatedly as she appealed to African American voters who could save her campaign if she loses Iowa and New Hampshire. She had a very strong closing argument and dominated when talk turned to foreign policy.",
        "What is Bernie Sanders talking about when he says he wants a \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d? The answer is a series of policies that would offer vast new benefits to individual Americans, including health insurance, paid maternity leave and free tuition at public colleges. To make those things possible, Sanders \u2014 a Vermont senator, \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d and Democratic presidential candidate \u2014 would impose a variety of new taxes on the wealthy, on corporations and on Wall Street trade.",

        "CHARLESTON, S. C. Hillary Clinton wrapped herself so tightly in President Obama\u2019s mantle at Sunday night\u2019s debate that it was a wonder she could walk off the stage.

        "With the lifting of international sanctions and the influx of more than $100 billion to Iran, the West has lost virtually any leverage it has over Tehran. We have already seen that rather than strictly interpret the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the Obama administration was more than willing, for example, to forgo inspection of military facilities for the sake of keeping the deal in place. Now, after delaying implementation of sanctions for Iran\u2019s violation of United Nations resolutions on ballistic missile testing, the administration comes out with a gentle slap on the wrist.",
        "Bernie Sanders was amped, angry and astringent at Sunday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate. Hillary Clinton did not win the night so much as Sanders, with his diatribes, lost it. A key moment came when the two battled it out over health care, the issue on which the campaigns have warred over the past week. Heading into the debate, Clinton and her campaign seemed to be foundering, taking obviously desperate shots at Sanders\u2019s plan.",

The storm needs to be watched closely this week \u2014 it has the largest snow potential we\u2019ve seen since 2010, but as we learned from watching the Nationals last year, potential isn\u2019t always realized.
