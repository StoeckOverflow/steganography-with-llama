Trump unfurled a highly anticipated endorsement from former Republican nominee Sarah Palin while campaigning in Iowa on Tuesday, giving him a jolt among the party\u2019s restless base.

        "Just whether the sharp of stocks signals an economic slowdown or recession is an open question. Most economists seem to think not. Strong job growth (2. 7 million more payroll jobs in 2015) and low interest rates will sustain slow but steady growth. Still, the dramatic stock market decline raises other possibilities.

        "PREVIOUSLY A in American politics, democratic socialism is gaining traction due to the presidential campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a nominal independent running as a Democrat. If Mr. Sanders is to close the sale with voters, he must show he has learned from socialism\u2019s mixed history abroad and devised an updated version that will work in the United States.
