        "NEW YORK \u2014 Mayor Bill de Blasio loped into a Brooklyn homeless shelter one day late last month, eager to demonstrate his command over a mushrooming homeless crisis that had already forced out two of his top advisers. Folding his frame in half, the Democratic mayor crouched down to hand out gifts to children, praised his team for \u201cextraordinary work,\u201d then faced a pack of reporters, one of whom asked why it took \u201cso long\u201d to make homelessness \u201ca top priority.",

        "Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder apologized to the residents of Flint for a water crisis that has prompted outrage, federal scrutiny and lawsuits, vowing to seek assistance for the city\u2019s residents. In his State of the State address on Tuesday night, Snyder said he was asking state lawmakers for $28 million to help residents reeling after Flint\u2019s drinking water became contaminated with dangerously high levels of lead. He also vowed to release his emails related to Flint from 2014 and 2015.",
        "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 Once again, horrific images of dead and injured students flashed across television screens in Pakistan. Once again, sobbing parents rushed into hospitals searching for their children. And once again, Pakistani youths are reminded they are targets for Islamists seeking to topple a government. On Wednesday, a little more than a year after Pakistani Taliban insurgents killed about 150 teachers and students at a school in northwestern Pakistan, militants took new aim at students on track to make up the country\u2019s future professional class.",
        "Years ago, my mother complained about a terrible earache. The pain was unbearable. And it wouldn\u2019t go away \u2014 for a week, she walked around with a debilitating ringing in her head. Eventually, she recalled to me the other day, the discomfort led her to a doctor, who carefully pushed an otoscope into her ear. Within seconds, he pulled it out and looked her in the face. \u201dHave you been putting in your ears?\u201d he asked with a disapproving tone. Like so many others, my mother had been using to clean her ears.",
        "Prime numbers are divisible only by themselves and by the number one, and as you might imagine, they become more mind boggling as numbers get larger. After all, there are infinite numbers to check for prime status. But now there\u2019s a new prime number with more than 22 million digits, which is 5 million longer than the previous record breaker. A text file containing the entire number takes up 21. 7 MB of space. The number was \u201ddiscovered\u201d by Curtis Cooper, a professor at the University of Central Missouri.",
        "It\u2019s a forecast that may lead to broken records: A textbook severe winter storm is primed to unload snow totals measured in feet starting Friday afternoon and ending late Saturday night. A blizzard warning spans the entire region from 3 p. m. Friday to 6 a. m. Sunday, when a vicious combination of heavy snow and strong winds will make travel difficult or impossible.

        "Metro officials say the entire rail and bus systems will be closed this weekend due to the major snowstorm expected in the region. Officials said they believe it is the longest closing in the system\u2019s history. Buses will run only on major corridors throughout the day Friday and will stop running at 5 p. m. Trains will run normally during the day, then stop running at 11 p. m. Friday. Service will not resume until at least Monday morning, officials said Thursday afternoon.",
        "A mere dusting of two inches of fluffy snow Wednesday evening brought traffic to a standstill. Some commuters were stuck in traffic for more than six hours, well past midnight, on major roads throughout the region. Ineffective weather forecast communication and lack of preparation by road crews converged to cause the nightmare. [An inch of snow, icy roads unleash 9 hours of traffic chaos across D.

        "LONDON \u2014 Gaunt and frail, his organs succumbing to the cruelly destructive power of radioactive poisoning, Alexander Litvinenko lay in a London hospital bed in November 2006 and identified the man responsible for his impending demise: Vladimir Putin. Nearly a decade later, an exhaustive inquiry by a British judge concluded on Thursday that the dying former KGB operative was probably right. For the first time, the Russian president was officially implicated in a murder that seemed plucked from the pages of a Cold War spy novel but actually played out in the bar of a posh hotel in London.",
        "We get it. Sen. Ted Cruz ( .) is rattled. He\u2019s afraid of losing Iowa. He doesn\u2019t know how to deal with Donald Trump. But he sure isn\u2019t helping matters with embarrassing arguments. His latest: \u201cRight now, the Washington establishment is abandoning [Sen.] Marco Rubio. They made the assessment that Marco can\u2019t win this race, and the Washington establishment is rushing over to support Donald Trump. \u201d Thunk. Let\u2019s consider the ways in which this is unhelpful. First, after spending months genuflecting to Trump as a kindred spirit, how can Trump be a closet establishment figure?",
        "The fixed smile on Donald Trump\u2019s face as Sarah Palin unleashed her \u2019 harangue endorsing him on Tuesday sent its own message. \u201cHow long do I have to stand here?\u201d it seemed to say. But of all the developments in the astonishing Republican presidential contest, this moment told us what we need to know about the state of a political party. Consider the forces that brought Palin to the national stage in the first place.",
        "Over at Politico, Thomas Wright has an excellent essay detailing Donald Trump\u2019s consistent foreign policy worldview: In sum, Trump believes that America gets a raw deal from the liberal international order it helped to create and has led since World War II. He has three key arguments that he returns to time and again over the past 30 years. He is deeply unhappy with America\u2019s military alliances and feels the United States is overcommitted around the world. He feels that America is disadvantaged by the global economy. And he is sympathetic to authoritarian strongmen.",

        "As Iowa comes down to the wire, the parallels to the 2008 battle between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are striking. Clinton has reverted to a message about the need for experience and toughness to confront a dangerous, complicated world. Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders is increasingly sounding an optimistic, inspirational message that promises a bright, progressive future that can, and will, be secured through mobilizing the masses, particularly younger voters, a vision that Clinton surely sees (just as she saw Barack Obama\u2019s vision) as vague, airy, and naive.",

        "The user\u2019s online handle was Pewter, and while logged onto a website called Playpen, he allegedly downloaded images of young girls being sexually molested. Pewter had carefully covered his tracks. To reach the site, he first had to install free software called Tor, the world\u2019s most tool for giving users anonymity online. In order to uncover Pewter\u2019s true identity and location, the FBI quietly turned to a technique more typically used by hackers.

        "As the D.
