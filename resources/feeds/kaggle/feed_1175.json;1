        "Top D. C. officials on Friday warned residents that the incoming blizzard has \u201cdeadly\u201d potential. Up to 36 hours of a \u201cwet and heavy\u201d snowstorm \u2014 at times dumping three inches per hour with 50 mph winds \u2014 is likely to bring down trees and power lines across the nation\u2019s capital, D. C. officials said Friday. \u201cWe see this as a major storm. It has life and death implications, and all the residents of the District of Columbia should treat it that way,\u201d D. C. Mayor Muriel E.",
        "Every year, eager children, panicked parents, frustrated commuters and exasperated employers ask us the same thing: Why is it so difficult to forecast snow in the D. C. region? Though forecasts were outstanding days in advance for this potentially historic winter storm, that is not always the case. In fact, it almost never is. The complicated truth that no one wants to hear is that each storm is different and the slightest variations in storm track, surface temperature and atmospheric moisture can lead to dramatically different outcomes.",
        "Alyson was due Friday. So was a blizzard. \u201cIt\u2019s a little stressful,\u201d acknowledged the spirits buyer for Total Wine. \u201cI won\u2019t lie. \u201d Friends and family texted her a gazillion times this week asking if she had a plan. Some offered advice, including: \u201cDon\u2019t have the baby on the highway. \u201d After hoping the forecast would change, and her husband gave in Thursday and made a plan, booking a hotel room near Adventist HealthCare Shady Grove Medical Center in Rockville, Md.",
        "JUST WHEN you thought the presidential campaign couldn\u2019t get any more bizarre \u2014 just when you thought American politics might finally have exhausted the possibilities for cynicism and irresponsibility \u2014 certain Republican Party insiders have begun developing strange new respect for the candidate whose meteoric rise only yesterday made him the bane of \u201cthe establishment\u201d: Donald Trump. For all his quirks, the rationalization goes, the billionaire businessman is a man you can do business with. \u201cRegardless of what your concern is with Trump,\u201d Rep. Peter King ( .",
        "I love poetic justice. This wild and wacky Republican presidential campaign deserved Sarah Palin, and now it\u2019s got her. Palin\u2019s endorsement of Donald Trump at an Iowa rally this week was a master class in surrealist poetry. Geniuses of the Dada movement would have been humbled by her deconstruction of the language and her obliteration of the bourgeois concept we call logic.

        "Give President Obama credit. His Iran nuclear deal may be disastrous but the packaging was brilliant. The prisoner exchange was meant to distract from last Saturday\u2019s official implementation of the deal. And it did. The Republicans concentrated almost all their fire on the swap sideshow. And in denouncing the swap, they were wrong. True, we should have made the prisoner release a precondition for negotiations. But that preemptive concession was made long ago (among many others, such as granting Iran in advance the right to enrich uranium).",
        "What happens when you cannot trust the chaperones? That\u2019s the role in which National Review was initially slotted to participate in a GOP debate in Houston. The idea was to pair National Review with mainstream media partner NBC News and Telemundo. The arrangement shadowed a similar setup for CNN, which has partnered on two GOP debates with Salem Communications and its star conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. Fox News and Fox Business Network, meanwhile, have been allowed to moderate their own debates, free of these minders.",
        "The arrival of Sarah Palin brings a special something to the 2016 campaign, like a little LSD added to the punch bowl. Are we watching   or a reality TV show, or a  Saturday Night Live",
        "Late Thursday night, National Review, the storied conservative magazine founded by William F. Buckley, published an issue denouncing Donald Trump. \u201cTrump is a philosophically unmoored political opportunist who would trash the broad conservative ideological consensus within the GOP in favor of a populism with overtones,\u201d the editors wrote. \u201cDonald Trump is a menace to American conservatism who would take the work of generations and trample it underfoot in behalf of a populism as heedless and crude as the Donald himself. \u201d Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation\u2019s capital.",
        "From the moment LeBron James returned to the Cleveland Cavaliers in July of 2014 after his South Beach sabbatical, the clock was ticking on David Blatt\u2019s tenure with the franchise. That was always the risk of Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert choosing to hire Blatt, who has a long and illustrious career coaching in Europe and international competition, before that summer\u2019s free agency had begun. After 18 months of seemingly constant tension, Cleveland fired Blatt on Friday afternoon. The move is hardly a surprise, but the timing is strange.",
        "KINGSTON, Jamaica \u2014 The ambitious young men sat for hours at a restaurant here to map out plans for a business venture that could make them millions. In a group that included three Jamaican entrepreneurs, one participant seemed out of place \u2014 a former U. S. Supreme Court law clerk of Cuban descent who was visiting from Washington. Ted Cruz had been invited by his roommate from Princeton and Harvard Law, David Panton, who was eager for the group to win the rights to manage a new investment enterprise launched by one of the island\u2019s most prominent executives.",

        "DES MOINES \u2014 With another Iowa presidential contest at risk of slipping out of Hillary Clinton\u2019s reach, the Democratic Party is launching a massive effort this weekend to boost her candidacy. A crowd of entertainment and political figures, including Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (Va.) a former party chairman, and Tony Goldwyn, star of the hit series \u201cScandal,\u201d is jetting to all corners of this state to help Clinton erase her enthusiasm deficit to Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt. ).",
        "It\u2019s one thing to publish an editorial denouncing Republican presidential Donald Trump; any news outlet can do that, and plenty have. It\u2019s another to get almost two dozen leading conservative thinkers to write essays arguing against the Manhattan billionaire\u2019s nomination and agree to print them under a single banner: \u201cAgainst Trump. \u201d [A YUGE number of conservatives just shredded Donald Trump in the National Review] That\u2019s what the National Review and its editor, Rich Lowry, just pulled off.",

        "Kurt Godwin\u2019s obituaries in The Washington Post and on Legacy. com contained all the basics: He was the son of a CIA officer. He lived in Alexandria, Va. and was married. He taught art at Virginia Commonwealth and Catholic universities. He died Sept. 19, 2014, at the age of 58. The cause of death was another matter. \u201cThe cause was cancer, said his wife, Karin Godwin,\u201d the Post obituary noted. \u201cKurt Douglas Godwin passed away at INOVA Fairfax Hospital, due to stage 4 Cancer complications,\u201d read a slightly more detailed death notice on Legacy.",
        "For the past year, New York based photographer Jonah Markowitz documented Tarvaris Sanders, a struggling teen from the South Side of Chicago who earned a full academic scholarship to Connecticut College.

        "As gale force winds swept in to drive snow that had been falling for 24 hours, authorities begged drivers to stay off the roads Saturday, Sunday and Monday, warning that it may take several days to dig out after one of the most prodigious snow storms to strike the Washington region in memory. After snow that had accumulated to depths greater than two feet, the powerful wind began toppling trees into power lines Saturday afternoon.",
        "While the Washington area grabbed much of the attention Saturday, snowstorms brought life to a halt along the rest of the East Coast as well, flooding streets in New Jersey, stranding thousands of drivers in Kentucky, canceling more than 9, 500 flights and prompting authorities in New York to ban all vehicles from the roads. Officials throughout the region pleaded with residents to stay off roads.

        "At first it seemed too weirdly awful to be true, but there she was: Sarah Palin standing next to Donald Trump on Tuesday and endorsing him for president.

        "During Watergate, Henry Kissinger\u2019s mordant wit leavened the unpleasantness: \u201cThe illegal we do immediately; the unconstitutional takes a little longer. \u201d President Obama often does both simultaneously, using executive authoritarianism to evade the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers and rewrite existing laws. Last week, however, the Supreme Court took a step toward correcting some of the constitutional vandalism that will be Obama\u2019s most significant legacy.

        "Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire and former New York mayor, is considering making an independent bid for the presidency, a move that could provide yet another wild turn in a 2016 race that has already seen more than its share of them. Bloomberg\u2019s deliberations, first reported by the New York Times, were confirmed Saturday by several close associates. Bloomberg has explored the possibility before, always making a pragmatic calculation of whether winning is feasible.

        "The feud between Donald Trump and Jeb Bush went to a whole new place on Friday night as the GOP needled the former Florida governor for recruiting his \u201dmommy,\u201d former first lady Barbara Bush, to help promote her son\u2019s candidacy. It began with a new video message and handwritten letter by the Bush family matriarch that is being sent to voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.",
        "There are two large questions as the Democratic campaign in Iowa enters its final days. One is whether Sen. Bernie Sanders can generate a significant turnout among caucus attendees. The second is whether the organization that Hillary Clinton has been building there since last spring is sturdy enough to withstand the Sanders insurgency. The last thing Clinton can afford now is for Sanders to get a head of steam from Iowa and New Hampshire. A pair of victories by the Vermont senator could produce a protracted and, for Clinton, debilitating nomination battle."
