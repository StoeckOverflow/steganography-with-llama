        "CLINTON, IOWA \u2014 Democratic groups that support Hillary Clinton and focus on women\u2019s issues have taken the gloves off against Sen. Bernie Sanders, a move aimed at undercutting his support among liberal voters, particularly younger women, days before the Iowa caucuses. The groups, including NARAL America and Emily\u2019s List, have seized on a comment by Sanders last week lumping them and other groups into the \u201cestablishment\u201d column, which he did in an effort to dismiss the importance of their support for Clinton.",
        "MANCHESTER, N. H. \u2014 At a Capitol Hill social club earlier this month, Marco Rubio\u2019s top advisers huddled with supportive House members to deliver a sober update about the Florida senator\u2019s chances. The aides, led by campaign manager Terry Sullivan, told the group that they were not expecting to win Iowa or New Hampshire, the first two states to vote. They said they were hopeful that things would turn their way by the next two, South Carolina and Nevada, but that, realistically, Rubio\u2019s path to victory would be a grind.",

        "LONDON \u2014 If you happen to have the chance to talk to young Icelanders about their religious beliefs, be prepared for a surprise. Exactly zero percent of respondents in a recent survey said they believe that God created the Earth. Only 20 years ago, nearly 90 percent of all Icelanders were religious believers. Today, less than 50 percent are. With its growing number of Iceland is distinct from much of the rest of the world, as a recent Gallup International and WI Network of Market Research poll found.",
        "Quick, what famous historical figures were living roughly 500 years ago? A few creative people might bring to mind the rhyme \u201cIn 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue,\u201d and recall Columbus, Ferdinand and Isabella. Some clever souls might recall that Michelangelo finished the Sistine Chapel in 1512, and recall from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles a few other names Leonardo, Raphael and Donatello. Or real history buffs might recall the astronomical work of Copernicus, or Henry VIII\u2019s diva dips in the early 1500s.",
        "Folks who ride a bike to work will tell you that there\u2019s simply no better way to commute. It\u2019s often the fastest way to get to work, it offers a wide array of route options, and, unlike driving or taking public transportation, doing it regularly is actually good for you. But the numbers from Capital Bikeshare tell a stark, though not shocking, story: People ride to work much less often in the winter.",
        "Talk about a ! You, East Coasters, were the folks who helped clear grocery store shelves over the past few days. You were planning to bake at leisure, do some and hunker down with bowls of steaming chili. Now the Capital Weather Gang\u2019s warning that due to expected high winds and heavy snowfall, \u201cbe prepared to lose power.",
        "The other day I arrived home just as my daughter was walking out the door. Rather than saying hello, she blurted, \u201cI\u2019m in a rush, so I didn\u2019t have time to replace the toilet paper on the toilet paper holder. \u201d This may seem like a bizarre greeting, but both my kids know that failure to replace the TP is one of my major pet peeves. Nevertheless, I get why my family fails at this. Replacing toilet paper on the common kind of holder is a pain; the tension rod often falls apart, and the inner spring pops out.",
        "The Washington region, battered by one of the biggest snow storms in recent memory, began a monumental dig out Sunday that is likely to continue for days and hobble the area well into the workweek. Morning brought the sight of mountains of plowed snow, and landscapes buried in white. The epic nor\u2019easter of 2016 closed its reign over the D. C. region Saturday night, moving up the Atlantic coast, hammering other cities in its path, and leaving in its wake a light breeze, cold temperatures and clear skies.",
        "The Snowzilla storm of January 22 and 23 goes down as one of the greats in the D. C. region. One to three feet of snow fell across the entire region. Amounts over 20 inches were common in the immediate D. C. area, while amounts of inches focused south and southeast of the city. Paralyzing depths of inches were reached to the west and northwest. A few isolated locations at higher elevations in Loudoun and Frederick counties (and to the west) tallied inches. Reagan National Airport received 17.",
        "After two days of being shuttered for snow, Metro will reopen Monday but with very limited underground service on only three lines, officials said Sunday. The system will open at 7 a. m. with limited service on the Red, Orange and Green lines as follows: the Orange Line will run between Ballston and Eastern Market; the Red Line will run between Medical Center and Union Station; and the Green Line will run between Fort Totten and Anacostia. Trains will run every 20 to 25 minutes, the agency said. Fares will not be charged.",
        "After 36 hours of hibernation, millions of Americans along the East Coast awoke to clear skies on Sunday morning, as well as a frozen landscape still paralyzed by transportation bans, power outages, impassable roads and snowfall. At least 18 deaths were attributed to this weekend\u2019s blizzard as far south as Arkansas and as far north as New York City, according to the news agency Reuters. Thirteen of those deaths were caused by traffic accidents, while three people died while shoveling snow and two died of hypothermia, Reuters reported.",
        "It\u2019s not that 17. 8 inches of snow wasn\u2019t enough. But the number that will go down in the history books as Washington\u2019s official total \u2014 recorded at Reagan National Airport \u2014 is downright paltry compared with some other spots in the region, raising the question: Why the disparity? The reason, it turns out, may be partly due to the improvised technique used by a small team of weather observers at the airport who lost their device to the elements midway through the blizzard. It was buried by the very snow it was supposed to measure.",
        "Correction: A previous version of this story said that newspaper publisher William Loeb endorsed Pete du Pont for president in 1988. In fact, Loeb had passed away; his wife, Nackey S. Loeb, was responsible for the endorsement. MANCHESTER, N. H. This courtship started like all the others. Back in March, two months before Donald Trump declared his candidacy and his war on Mexican \u201crapists,\u201d he went to see Joe McQuaid, the publisher of the New Hampshire Union Leader. The hallowed institution is the only statewide newspaper in New Hampshire.",
        "For Hillary Clinton, it\u2019s starting to look like deja vu all over again. Start a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination as giant . Check. Raise tens of millions of dollars and look unbeatable for large swaths of the year before the primaries start. Check. An insurgent challenger running to her ideological left? Check. Collapsing poll numbers on the eve of actual votes? Check. Over the past week or so, Clinton has watched as her national polling lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) a socialist, has shrunk.",
        "A grim mortal calculus met nausea. My husband and I learned I was pregnant just before he drove my stepson to college. As you might guess, the pregnancy was unplanned. My husband was 56 \u2014 that would make him almost 80 by the time this kid was out of college. I was 42, so I\u2019d be in my 60s with a teen and an elderly spouse. And what if I, like both my parents, got cancer in middle age? Who would be there to finish ? I believe in abortion. That wasn\u2019t my hesitation.",

There probably aren\u2019t too many college students in America who are dreaming right now of making it big there. And yet, if you were to make a list of places that are vying to become new centers for innovation, you wouldn\u2019t dare leave out Waterloo, which is booming with tech and is in hot pursuit of an emerging technology called quantum computing.",

African Americans \u2014 200, 000 of them \u2014 had fought in that war, which made it hard to deny them equal rights. Unlike with the 150th anniversary of the Civil War, however, few historic places tell us what happened during Reconstruction.",
        "SOME 50 million people are likely to watch Tom Brady take on Peyton Manning in Sunday\u2019s AFC championship game, and an even larger share of the U. S. population will probably tune in to Super Bowl 50 next month. Watching (though not playing) football is the American pastime. One of the few experiences that remains in the Internet age is enjoying a form of moderately restrained violence. But, for increasing numbers of fans, that enjoyment is tinged with moral qualm. Seemingly every week brings stories about the awful toll the sport takes on its players.",
        "DECORAH, Iowa \u2014 When Bernie Sanders entered the presidential race last spring, he was considered a fringe figure \u2014 an unapologetic independent whose \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d would eschew campaign customs and center around his liberal agenda. Now, with an upset over Hillary Clinton in next Monday\u2019s Iowa caucuses in sight, Sanders has emerged as a more combative \u2014 and in some ways, more conventionally political \u2014 candidate.",
        "DENVER \u2014 Peyton Manning isn\u2019t quite finished. He wasn\u2019t derailed yet again by Tom Brady and the New England Patriots, and he had his defense to thank for that. In a season in which Manning at times has looked done, he is back in the Super Bowl. He prevailed here Sunday in his 17th career quarterbacking duel with Brady, aided greatly by an overpowering and resilient Denver defense that carried the Broncos to a triumph over the Patriots in the AFC title game.",
        "N. C. \u2014 Rosanell Eaton still remembers the day 70 years ago when she traveled two hours with her mother in a wagon to register to vote at the county courthouse. Before she could, she was forced to take a literacy test. \u201cWhat are you here for, little lady?\u201d Eaton recalls a man at the courthouse asking her. When she told him, he instructed her, \u201cDon\u2019t miss a word, and speak the preamble of the Constitution of the United States of America. \u201d \u201cWithout missing a word, I did it,\u201d she said.",

        "I was pretty sure I knew who to vote for earlier this month, until Jeffrey Cohen died. See, when Ernest Overbey died on Jan. 2, his obituary in the Richmond instructed readers to \u201dplease vote for Donald Trump\u201d (as well as to donate to the hospital that cared for him). I\u2019m certainly not going to reject a dying man\u2019s wish, so that was that. Then Mr. Cohen died in Pittsburgh.",
        "January is prime time for returns in the retail industry, the month where shoppers show up in droves to trade in an sweater from grandma or to unload the second and third \u201cFrozen\u201d dolls that showed up under the Christmas tree. This ritual has always been costly for retailers, comprising a large share of the $284 billion in goods that were returned in 2014. But now it is arguably becoming more urgent for the industry to think carefully about return policies, as analysts say the rise of online shopping is bringing with it a surge in returns.",
        "Metro will restore service on all lines Tuesday, except the Silver, as the capital region struggles to dig out from under more than two feet of snow. With major highways reopened after the monumental weekend storm, snow plows turned to secondary roads Monday, but it may be days before they reach into the warren of residential streets to excavate homeowners snow bound since Friday. Metro will resume full rail service on all but the Silver Line at 5 a. m. and bus service will be expanded, though still limited, after it was partially restored Monday. At 3 p. m.",
        "AUSTIN, Texas \u2014 A Houston grand jury investigating undercover footage of Planned Parenthood found no wrongdoing Monday by the abortion provider and instead indicted activists involved in making the videos that provoked outrage among Republican leaders nationwide. David Daleiden, founder of the Center for Medical Progress, was indicted on a felony charge of tampering with a governmental record and a misdemeanor count related to purchasing human organs. Another activist, Sandra Merritt, was also indicted on a charge of tampering with a governmental record.",
        "Inside a secure conference room on the 6th floor of the Justice Department in early 2014, top federal law enforcement officials gathered to hear what criminal charges prosecutors were contemplating against David H. Petraeus, the storied wartime general and former CIA director whose public career had ended about 15 months earlier over an extramarital affair. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and FBI Director James B.

        "THE MORNING PLUM: The Hillary Clinton campaign has been engaged in an aggressive effort to accomplish one crucial political goal: Knocking off Bernie Sanders\u2019 halo. One common thread running through many Clinton attacks on Sanders \u2014 whether it\u2019s questioning his record on guns or suggesting his single payer dream isn\u2019t going to happen \u2014 has been to try to portray Sanders as a conventional politician (after all) who is not quite as pure as the scenes of his rapt, transported crowds suggest and is promising more than he can deliver."
