        "THE immigrant rancor and outright nativism afoot in the Republican primary field give rise to the impression that illegal immigration has soared to unprecedented levels and that the border is no more than a line in the sand, scarcely monitored and easily crossed. The truth diverges wildly from that rhetoric, as a pair of recent studies demonstrate.",
        "Let\u2019s face it: we in the media are suckers for any kind of political story that offers something unpredictable. And like clockwork, every four years someone suggests that there might be a viable presidential candidacy in the offing, spurring legions of reporters and commentators to lick their lips in anticipation. At the moment the attention is focused on former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, but there is also discussion of whether conservatives might rally around a candidate if Donald Trump, no true conservative he, becomes the GOP nominee. I have some bad news: It ain\u2019t gonna happen.",
        "The extremists occupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge may have thought they were \u201ctaking back\u201d seized land on behalf of local ranchers. In reality, these intruders are attempting to seize land that belongs to all of us. Their actions are nothing less than an attack on the property and the rights of the American people. The misguided protesters believe that this treasured wildlife refuge, a sanctuary for more than 300 bird species, should be handed over to a small group of to exploit and profit from as they wish, at the expense of the public and of future generations.",
        "The Supreme Court ruled Monday that those sentenced as teenagers to life imprisonment for murder must have a chance to argue that they be released from prison. The court said its 2012 decision that struck down mandatory life imprisonment terms without parole for juveniles must be applied retroactively. That would mean new sentencing or a chance to argue for parole, said Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who wrote the decision. The decision continues the trend of the court in deciding that juveniles convicted of even the most heinous crimes must be treated differently than adults.",

Jeff Hallock, of the Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department, told reporters at a news conference Monday. \u201cThey\u2019re facing some very serious charges. Again, that\u2019s why we\u2019re pleading for the public\u2019s help because we know someone out there knows something.",
        "Bernie Sanders did a town hall event Monday morning in Iowa Falls, Iowa. He asked the crowd for testimonials about the difficulties of sustaining a life off of $12, 000 a year. What happened next is both hard to to and important. A woman is called on and she emotionally tells the story of her life minimum wage jobs despite a degree, on disability and living with her parents. Here\u2019s a snippet of what she said: It\u2019s so hard to do anything to pay your bills, you\u2019re ashamed all the time.",
        "It\u2019s been 10 years, but Jeffrey Joseph still remembers the sense of panic. He stepped off the elevator and opened the door.

Aggressively. \u201cWelcome to the 77th, and last, Academy Awards,\u201d he said.

        "To modern eyes, the classic trio of Disney princess films \u2014 released in 1937, 1950 and 1959 \u2014 can seem painfully retrograde. Why are characters so obsessed with Snow White\u2019s looks? Why doesn\u2019t Cinderella have any talents or hobbies? And why doesn\u2019t Sleeping Beauty do anything besides get drugged and await rescue? A generational gap divides Disney\u2019s princess franchise. After 1959\u2019s \u201cSleeping Beauty,\u201d it took 30 years for the studio to produce another animated princess feature. The intervening decades saw dramatic change. Walt Disney died.

Amid extraordinary moves to rein in criticism at home, Chinese security personnel are reaching confidently across borders, targeting Chinese and foreign citizens who dare to challenge the Communist Party line, in what one Western diplomat has called the \u201cworst crackdown since Tiananmen Square. \u201d A string of incidents, including abductions from Thailand and Hong Kong, forced repatriations and the televised \u201cconfessions\u201d of two Swedish citizens, has crossed a new red line, according to diplomats in Beijing.",

        "NEW BLOOMINGTON, Ohio \u2014 On the phone, the boy was frantic. After traveling hundreds of miles from a village in Guatemala, he had made it across the U. S. border and into a shelter for unaccompanied minors. But then something went terribly wrong. Instead of sending him to his uncle, Carlos Enrique Pascual, a landscape worker in Florida, authorities said the shelter released the teenager to traffickers who took him to central Ohio, held him captive in a trailer and threatened to kill him if he tried to leave.",

        "It\u2019s ironic that the party given to denouncing manufactured victimhood (on campuses, among liberal activists) should be so, well, wimpy and quick to cast blame these days. Donald Trump threatens not to show up at the debate on Thursday because Megyn Kelly, he says, is biased. Sen. Ted Cruz ( .) whines that the \u201cestablishment\u201d (people with two Ivy League degrees?) is united against him, even though he has been haranguing the establishment for years.",

Not only did the grand jury choose not to indict Planned Parenthood, they decided that crimes may have been committed \u2014 but by the activists of the CMP.",
        "Bernie Sanders is running a new TV ad in Iowa that takes direct aim at those who have questioned whether the \u201crevolution\u201d he promises could actually succeed in achieving change. The ad essentially argues that these critics suffer from a limited political imagination. Which raises a question: What, specifically, would actually have to happen for his promised revolution to have a prayer of delivering the kind of major reform he says is necessary to address the problems the country faces?",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s treatment of women drove Megyn Kelly\u2019s controversial question to the Republican on Aug. 6 during a GOP debate in Cleveland: Mr. Trump, one of the things people love about you is you speak your mind and you don\u2019t use a politician\u2019s filter. However, that is not without its downsides, in particular, when it comes to women. You\u2019ve called women you don\u2019t like \u201cfat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals. \u201d Your Twitter account \u2026 has several disparaging comments about women\u2019s looks.",
        "FREEDOM, N. H. \u2014 Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz strode into the general store in this aptly named New England village last week and, with the swagger and zeal of a warrior, rattled off the problems facing the country: Federal regulations are a jackboot strangling everyone. Obamacare is a disaster, and taxes are too high. Constitutional rights are being violated left and right. Sanctuary cities are endangering citizens. The terrorists are beating us.

        "Bonnie Lieb said she expected to pay more than usual for an Uber ride from her Sterling, Va. home to Reagan National Airport Monday morning. With her car still covered in two feet of snow and her street unplowed, she said, she agreed to pay the Uber surge price of 4. 4 times the normal fare.

        "Why can\u2019t we be like other big cities? That was the sentiment from a number of D. C. residents, who wondered \u2014 or fumed \u2014 about why a subway system in the nation\u2019s capital had to shut down and then lurch back into only limited service after a major snowstorm. Yes, it was a blizzard \u2014 but how come New York kept its subway running or returned to normal service so quickly? This doesn\u2019t happen in Boston, does it?
