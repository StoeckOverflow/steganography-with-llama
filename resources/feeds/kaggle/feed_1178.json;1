        "People of all ages gather in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, for an unseasonable winter activity: swimming. The members of the Cryophile club bond over their fondness for icy waters. As the club\u2019s name would suggest, they thrive in temperatures that often reach 22 degrees below zero. Reuters photographer Ilya Naymushin documented the Cyrophiles on the banks of the Yenisei River. Their reasons for this frigid bathing include perceived health benefits and the sheer adrenaline rush. \u201cThe moment of immersion is a sensation of delight.",
        "Federal agents sealed off an Oregon wildlife refuge occupied by armed protesters Wednesday, hours after authorities arrested several members of that group and killed one of the most prominent occupiers. The frenzy of activity at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Harney County marked a sudden escalation in the ongoing standoff that has simmered for more than three weeks, ever since a small group of men and women took control of a remote facility in southeastern Oregon.",
        "Robert \u201cLaVoy\u201d Finicum styled himself as a cowboy, down to the Stetson hat and Colt . 45 pistol on his hip. And he lived his life adhering to a similarly code \u2014 right up until his death Tuesday in a confrontation with federal and state authorities. With a shaved head and a soft voice, the Arizona rancher became the de facto spokesman for the band of armed men and women camped out at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in remote Oregon.",
        "Growing up, Bernie Sanders followed the path of many young American Jews. He went to Hebrew school, was bar mitzvahed and traveled to Israel to work on a kibbutz. But as an adult, Sanders drifted away from Jewish customs. And as his bid for the White House gains momentum, he has the chance to make history. Not just as the first Jewish president \u2014 but as one of the few modern presidents to present himself as not religious. \u201cI am not actively involved with organized religion,\u201d Sanders said in a recent interview.",
        "Donald Trump is obsessed with being in control. He picks and chooses which journalists get interviews, often calling into news shows so that it\u2019s easier for him to talk through questions. All but two of his top campaign aides are forbidden from talking to the media, a rule that\u2019s strictly enforced. And he seems to relish throwing liberal protesters out of his private rallies. At every turn, the GOP presidential tries to be the top boss.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: CNN has published a truly remarkable series of interviews with scores and scores of Donald Trump supporters across the country that helps shed some light on a key question about the 2016 contest. Are Trump\u2019s supporters backing him because his Fortress America approach \u2014 his American Greatness nationalism \u2014 is resonating with his backers\u2019 economic and cultural anxieties? Or is the explanation a bit darker \u2014 are they backing him precisely because the xenophobic and demagogic elements of his rhetoric, i. e.",
        "I adore Bernie Sanders. I agree with his message of fairness and I share his outrage over inequality and corporate abuses. I think his righteous populism has captured the moment perfectly. I respect the uplifting campaign he has run. I admire his authenticity. Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation\u2019s capital. He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000. View Archive Facebook Google+ RSS And I am convinced Democrats would be insane to nominate him. Hillary Clinton, by contrast, is a dreary candidate. She has, again, failed to connect with voters.",
        "Donald Trump has perfect demagogic appeal to a cross section of the voters who are furious at, disillusioned by and entirely contemptuous of political elites. They are \u201cstupid. \u201d They\u2019ve sold you down the river to the Chinese. They are giving your jobs to illegal immigrants. Trump has taken George Wallace to a whole new level, complete with a foreign policy playbook that harks back to Fortress America and a Charles appeal, telling allies to fend for themselves.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that he will boycott Thursday\u2019s Fox News debate is a major strategic blunder \u2014 the first of his otherwise brilliant presidential campaign. If he follows through on his threat, he could regret it. First, skipping the debate makes Trump look weak. Trump\u2019s campaign is centered on his image as the toughest candidate out there, Republican or Democrat \u2014 the man who can face down China, Iran and the Islamic State. He takes pride in throwing hecklers out of his campaign events. In October, a few months after Black Lives Matter protesters took the microphone from Sen.",
        "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday acknowledged that the economy slowed down at the end of last year and maintained that it expects to raise interest rates gradually. In a unanimous vote, the nation\u2019s central bank kept the target range for its benchmark interest rate unchanged between 0. 25 percent and 0. 5 percent, as expected. An official statement noted that exports and inventory investment have been weak, while low oil and commodity prices have pushed down inflation.",
        "In Flint, Mich. there is a famous block of concrete that for decades has served as a community message board. Like an   Facebook feed, residents use it to post personal news, images, upcoming events and commentary in sprawling graffiti.",
        "As national attention focuses on Flint, Mich. \u2014 where water flowed for over a year to a relatively poor, minority community \u2014 new research suggests that across the U. S. communities like these are more likely to be exposed to some of the most intense pollution.",
        "On Wednesday, Transparency International (TI) the world\u2019s leading organization, is publishing its annual Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI). The CPI is a great tool for ensuring that corruption and measures remain on the public policy agenda, but we should nonetheless be very wary of taking its findings too seriously. The CPI has been around since 1995 and measures how much corruption is perceived to exist in the public sector. The 2015 edition includes data on 168 countries and territories, each of which gets a score out of 100.",

        "BURLINGTON, Iowa \u2014 Marco Rubio\u2019s first questioner was blunt: \u201cOn your will you follow God\u2019s word?\u201d For the next few minutes, Rubio sounded more like a Sunday school teacher than a presidential candidate holding an early January town hall. He talked about John the Baptist, he referred to Jesus as \u201c man,\u201d and he explained his yearning to share \u201ceternity with my creator. \u201d Then, he answered the question: \u201cYes, I try every day in everything I do.",
        "Bernie Sanders isn\u2019t the first presidential candidate to oppose reparations for slavery. All the same, the Vermont senator running for the Democratic presidential nomination has been criticized for his position over the past few days. Coates of the Atlantic noted that Sanders promises his liberal supporters their dreams on all kinds of other issues, even if those dreams are controversial and politically infeasable. The issue of race should be no different, Coates argued. It is, though. Recent research shows that Americans think about racial questions differently than other political issues.",
        "UPDATE 3:01 P. M. Paul Allen\u2019s Vulcan Inc. issued a statement to GeekWire saying that the yacht\u2019s crew was directed to anchor in the designated area and moved the ship when it found out something could be amiss: \u201cMedia reports are greatly exaggerated and the investigation by the local authorities is continuing. The local port authority had directed the Tatoosh to anchor in a designated area, and the crew moved the vessel, on its own accord, as soon as it learned from local divers that there might be a problem.",
        "The top Republican candidates \u2014 minus one, perhaps \u2014 will face off Thursday night in Des Moines for the final time before the Iowa caucuses, in a crucial presidential debate that Donald Trump has promised to boycott. The main debate will begin at 9 p. m. Eastern on Fox News Channel. But Trump, who seems to be leading in Iowa and everywhere else, said he won\u2019t be there. The candidate demanded that Fox replace moderator Megyn Kelly, because he thinks she asked unfair questions in a past debate and because she has angered him with commentary since then.",
        "It is common for media companies to seize upon popular television events and make blog posts called \u201dWhat time is the [whatever]\u201d in order to attract attention (by which we mean readers, by which we mean potential ). The most famous example is a post titled, \u201dWhat time is the Super Bowl,\u201d which the traffic pioneers at the Huffington Post rode to advertiser glory a few years ago creating, along the way, a reference point. But then I found myself actually curious about what was happening tonight and having to poke around to find out. So, here.",
        "BURNS, Ore. \u2014 The armed occupation of an Oregon wildlife refuge is dwindling, as officials arrested additional people involved and continued Thursday to blockade the facility. Authorities also have revealed new details about what they observed in this area in the weeks leading up to and since the siege began, including reports of threats and intimidation before the takeover and, in one case, concerns about whether the armed group would try to move from the remote Malheur National Wildlife Refuge into a more populated area.",
        "The medieval mathematicians of Oxford, toiling in torchlight in a land ravaged by plague, managed to invent a simple form of calculus that could be used to track the motion of heavenly bodies. But now a scholar studying ancient clay tablets suggests that the Babylonians got there first, and by at least 1, 400 years. The astronomers of Babylonia, scratching tiny marks in soft clay, used surprisingly sophisticated geometry to calculate the orbit of what they called the White Star \u2014 the planet Jupiter. These tablets are quite incomprehensible to the untrained eye.",

        "International Holocaust Remembrance Day is always a somber time for Auschwitz survivor Irene Weiss. But this year\u2019s observance had an additional layer of grief: For the first time, Weiss is worried about her adopted homeland. \u201cI am exceptionally concerned about demagogues,\u201d the Weiss told me at Wednesday\u2019s commemoration at the U. S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. \u201cThey touch me in a place that I remember.

        "All politicians like to brag about their abilities and achievements. But rarely has a presidential hopeful emerged like Donald Trump, who consistently touts his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and plans for the nation in sweeping and terms. Trump is particularly unique in how he talks about himself. Plenty of presidents make dubious claims about what they have accomplished in elected office (created millions of jobs! slashed spending! ). Few make such claims about their personal attributes. Trump has no such hesitation. Just before the Iowa caucuses, here are five of the biggest myths Donald Trump tells about himself.",
        "Born in 1821 in South Carolina, James Longstreet graduated from West Point in 1842 and served with distinction in the Mexican War. As the officer corps split along sectional lines, he joined the Confederacy in 1861, eventually rising to join Gen. Robert E. Lee\u2019s inner circle. But it was after Appomattox that Longstreet truly distinguished himself \u2014 as the rare to accept the South\u2019s defeat, and its consequences. He urged fellow white Southerners to support the federal government and help rebuild their region on the basis of greater racial equality. He joined Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Republican Party.",
        "Without delving into meaty policy issues (heaven forbid!) questioning in the GOP presidential debates has become repetitive and therefore unrevealing. Practiced observers can virtually predict the questions and give the exact responses that will be delivered by each candidate. We can only hope more substantive questions get asked, but, in lieu of those, moderators should \u2014 but likely do not have the nerve \u2014 to ask the candidates: Gov. Jeb Bush, are you appalled at GOP voters who are embracing a nativist bully like Donald Trump? (You have to think Bush, along with many conservatives, truly are.",
        "Student and professor sat across a desk from each other one October morning in a Georgetown University office. The subject was an essay assignment in Professor Elizabeth Velez\u2019s Feminist Theory class, in which she tasked her 19 students with writing a to paper explaining and supporting their own personal theory of feminism. Velez had invited all the students to visit during her regular office hours to go over their theses. This particular meeting did not go well. \u201cFeminism is not a political movement,\u201d said Madeline Budman, a sophomore English major from Norfolk, Va. bouncing her thesis off her professor.",

        "DES MOINES \u2014 Move over, Donald Trump. Stand aside, Fox News. There\u2019s a new feud underway between a presidential candidate and a news media organization \u2014 this one between a Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and the editorial page of this newspaper. The first volley was the editorial, posted late Wednesday online and in Thursday\u2019s print edition, headlined: \u201dA campaign full of fiction.\u201d The print edition contended, \u201dSen. Sanders is not a brave . He\u2019s just telling progressives what they want to hear.\u201d It got even rougher from there.",
        "The Obama administration failed to protect thousands of Central American children who have flooded across the U. S. border since 2011, leaving them vulnerable to traffickers and other abuses at the hands of caretakers, a Senate investigation has found. The Office of Refugee Resettlement, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services, failed to do proper background checks of adults who claimed the children, allowed sponsors to take custody of multiple unrelated children, and regularly placed children in homes without visiting the locations, according to a investigative report released Thursday."
