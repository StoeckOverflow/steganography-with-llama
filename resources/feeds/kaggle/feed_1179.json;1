        "The space shuttle Challenger exploded 30 years ago Thursday, killing its seven crew members, including high school teacher Christa McAuliffe, the woman touted as \u201cthe first private citizen\u201d in space. If things had gone differently, Kathy Sawyer might have become the second. Sawyer, then a Washington Post reporter in her early 40s, was a finalist for NASA\u2019s program to place a journalist on a shuttle mission. On Jan. 28, 1986, though, she was on the ground at Kennedy Space Center, covering a space story for the first time.",
        "\u201cAffluenza\u201d teen Ethan Couch was deported Thursday to Texas, more than a month after he and his mother fled to Mexico. Couch, 18, landed at Worth International Airport late Thursday morning just hours after Mexican immigration authorities told the Associated Press that he had been taken to a Mexico City airport and put on a commercial flight. A video from Mexico\u2019s National Institute of Migration showed Couch, in jeans and a hoodie, being transported just before dawn from a detention center to an airplane.",
        "Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and the man who negotiated his release from an Iranian prison, Secretary of State John F. Kerry, lauded the principle of bringing Americans in trouble home, no matter how hard, as they shared a stage Monday at the opening of The Post\u2019s new headquarters. Rezaian, who was released with four other U. S. citizens on Jan. 16, and Kerry both choked up with emotion while addressing senior Post executives and invited guests in the main conference room at The Post\u2019s K Street offices in Washington.",
        "Which state\u2019s residents are most fulfilled? Hawaii\u2019s, of course. The island nation \u2014 often compared to paradise \u2014 scores highest on a new ranking of states by residents\u2019s . But, if that was obvious, the state that ranked second may not be: it\u2019s Alaska. That\u2019s according to the latest Index, a ranking that seeks to capture how residents of each state feel about their sense of purpose and community, social and financial status and physical health. The ranking is based on more than 175, 000 telephone interviews of adults conducted throughout 2015.",
        "I wanted to break my children of a bad habit they had of dropping things into my shopping cart without first checking the price. So now there\u2019s a money rule they must follow when we go shopping: If they put something in the cart and they can\u2019t tell me how much it cost, out it goes. There are two reasons for the rule. First, since they aren\u2019t paying, they often don\u2019t think they need to know how much something costs. But even when I\u2019m not paying for something, I try to be mindful of its price.",
        "When photographer Lianne Milton arrived in the urban coastal city of Recife, it had just become \u201cground zero\u201d for the Zika virus. \u201cBy then, mothers were sent to their regional hospitals,\u201d Milton told In Sight via email. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel this sense of panic so much as I felt a sense of anger or sadness from the mothers.",
        "The State Department has concluded there is \u201dtop secret\u201d material in Hillary Clinton\u2019s email correspondence from the time she was secretary of state, indicating that some of her emails will never be released, even in heavily redacted form, because they are too sensitive for the public to view. State Department spokesman John Kirby said the material crosses seven email chains, amounting to 37 pages worth of material.",
        "DES MOINES \u2014 Despite her immediate hurdles in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, Hillary Clinton has been quietly growing her political networks in states that come later on the presidential calendar, confident that she can deny insurgent Bernie Sanders the Democratic nomination by swamping him in a delegate slog. Many in Clinton\u2019s Iowa staff of more than 100 are expected to quickly fan out to the two dozen states holding primaries and caucuses in March.",
        "Customers line up to enter a Bicentenario supermarket in Caracas, Venezuela. (Jorge ) The only question now is whether Venezuela\u2019s government or economy will completely collapse first. The key word there is \u201dcompletely.\u201d Both are well into their death throes. Indeed, Venezuela\u2019s ruling party just lost congressional elections that gave the opposition a majority, and it\u2019s hard to see that getting any better for them any time soon \u2014 or ever.",
        "He can\u2019t forget the first day. White walls. Room the size of a table. The silence. It came in November 2014. Kevin Bushrod Jr. said he didn\u2019t understand why he was isolated. A cop had pulled him over for driving on a suspended license. He tried to escape. The cop shot him in the left shoulder. Bushrod, a former top athlete at a Bible college, was charged with assault on an officer while armed \u2014 the car was the weapon. And now, he was here. Facing years in prison.",
        "President Obama proposed a new rule Friday that would require every large company in America to report employees\u2019 pay based on race and gender, an effort to reduce longstanding pay inequities for women and minorities. The new policy, already drawing criticism from some business leaders, would order companies with at least 100 employees to add salary numbers on a form they already annually submit that reports employees\u2019 sex, age and job groups. The new pay information would alert the EEOC to companies with significant wage disparities, which could result in lawsuits.",
        "If you ask Donald Trump fans why they like him, there\u2019s an excellent chance they\u2019ll say, \u201cBecause he\u2019s not politically correct. \u201d But this is true only if you misunderstand the meaning of political correctness, as Trump himself apparently does. Kathleen Parker writes a column on politics and culture. She received the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary In 2010.",
        "DES MOINES The sobering reality of Barack Obama s presidency has been the difficulty of achieving the change that he promised. The surprising development of the 2016 campaign is the degree to which a large segment of Democratic voters, at least in the early voting states, appear to have forgotten or rejected that lesson. Ruth Marcus is a columnist for The Post, specializing in American politics and domestic policy. View Archive Facebook RSS They seem willing to entrust their hopes of retaining the presidency to a candidate envisioning change far more radical than anything Obama ever dangled before them.",
        "Wednesday evening at the Embassy of Israel, I observed two unforgettable firsts. Until then, no Israeli ceremony honoring who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust had ever been held in the United States. This year, four honorees \u2014 two Americans and two Poles \u2014 were posthumously inducted into the ranks of some 26, 000 Righteous Among the Nations hailed by Israel in gratitude for their courage and compassion.

        "Of the 545 days my colleague Jason Rezaian spent in an Iranian prison, perhaps the most unusual was the time his captors let him watch \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u201d on Iranian state television. The next day, a hulking man who was guarding Rezaian asked if he\u2019d watched the film, in which the Tim Robbins character wrongfully imprisoned for 19 years escapes by digging a tunnel.

        "Woodrow Wilson, who enjoyed moralizing about the mundane, called paying taxes a \u201cglorious privilege. \u201d In 1865, when there was a Civil War income tax, one taxpayer shared this sensibility, sort of. Mark Twain said that his tax bill of $36. 82 (including a $3. 12 fine for filing late) made him feel \u201cimportant\u201d because the government was paying attention to him. Today, Rep. Kevin Brady wants to change the way government pays attention to taxpayers. Congress is like a Calder mobile: Something jiggled here causes things to wiggle over there.",
        "AFTER A traffic stop to end the unlawful occupation of a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon took a deadly turn, local sheriff Dave Ward was visibly upset when he appeared at a news briefing. He talked about the efforts to end the standoff peacefully and the work of multiple agencies to devise the best tactical plan, and he lamented the death of one of the armed occupiers. But he also stressed that \u201cI\u2019m here to uphold the law.",
        "It just became much harder to buy a gun through Facebook. While Facebook itself doesn\u2019t sell guns, it has dealt for years with the right way to handle sales of regulated goods such as firearms, adult toys and prescription drugs on its social media network. On Friday, the firm changed its policy regarding firearms, completely banning any firearms sales on its network. That means users can no longer offer or coordinate the private sale of firearms on the site. This policy also applies to the sale of gun parts and ammunition, said a Facebook spokeswoman.",
        "GENEVA \u2014 Peace talks aimed at ending the Syrian war got off to a rocky start Friday, with the opposition saying it would send delegates to consult on the goal of the negotiations but still refusing to commit to attend them. The announcement by the opposition that it would send a team to consult with the United Nations came at the end of a confusing day during which U. N. officials declared that the talks had officially opened even though the delegation opposed to President Bashar had not shown up.",
        "There was no avoiding it, and Fox News Channel didn\u2019t really try: Megyn Kelly was the star of the show at Thursday\u2019s Republican presidential debate in Des Moines. Kelly, of course, is a big reason that GOP Donald Trump refused to participate. Ever since their at the first primary debate in August, Trump has maintained that Kelly is a \u201dlightweight\u201d who doesn\u2019t ask fair questions. (Never mind that he previously said she\u2019s a great moderator.) Unreasonable as Trump\u2019s critique might be, all eyes were on Kelly and her questions in Des Moines.",
        "Judges at the high school competition in the Bronx\u2019s Van Cortlandt Park had a problem. Joe and Clarence Scott, the twin seniors from Brooklyn Automotive High School, crossed the finish line of the mile race that drizzly, cold November day in first place simultaneously. Holding hands. The pair were among the top runners in their age group in the city in 1958, often winning or finishing near the top of the standings in distance events. But the Scotts\u2019 unusual finish was a violation of the rules, since it implied that they\u2019d colluded on the ending.",
        "FAIRFIELD, Iowa \u2014 Every morning and every evening, and sometimes in between, this rural community appears to undergo a massive outbreak of narcolepsy. Gathering in giant domes or sitting in the privacy of their own homes, hundreds of men and women will take the time to close their eyes, bow their heads and sit motionless for 20 minutes. With the caucuses just days away, this unlikely mecca for practitioners of Transcendental Meditation is getting a jolt of activity. There have been visits from Hillary Clinton, as well as HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, her potential running mate.",
        "Almonds, the beloved snack that recently overtook peanuts as the most consumed nut in America, might have gotten a little too popular for their own good. After years of steady price increases, thanks in large part to demand, the nut has suddenly become much cheaper. Almond prices, which reached record highs early last year, have fallen by about 25 percent compared with late 2014. \u201dThey dropped a lot faster and further than anyone had expected,\u201d said Vernon Crowder, who is a senior analyst at Rabobank, a food and agribusiness research firm.",
        "Is a photograph art? Is it a scientific tool? Or is it, with the advent of smartphones, simply another way to communicate with each other? Whichever idea you find yourself agreeing with, we know one thing is true: The practice of photography is old now, almost 180 years old including the cyanotypes shown above. And with age comes the death of copyright. This month, the New York Public Library announced the release of thousands of documents, including historical photographs, that the public is free to use or display.",
        "DES MOINES \u2014 With campaign events all across Iowa on Saturday overflowing with voters, the Republican and Democratic contests have been reduced to the same question: Can the muscle of traditional and methodical organizing overcome the energy and enthusiasm of a pair of unconventional candidates in this unconventional race?",
        "HUBBARD, Iowa \u2014 His voice quavering with emotion, Mike Valde told Sen. Ted Cruz ( .) about his : He was a barber who couldn\u2019t afford health care until the Affordable Care Act, and after getting coverage he went to the doctor for the first time in years, and was diagnosed with multiple tumors. He died soon after. \u201cMark never had health care until Obamacare,\u201d Valde told Cruz in a middle school cafeteria here. \u201cWhat are you going to replace it with?\u201d Cruz has made repealing the Affordable Care Act one of the central tenets of his presidential run.",
        "MUSCATINE, Iowa \u2014 \u201cWelcome to Muscatine, and thank you for bringing the sun,\u201d a woman joked to Sen. Marco Rubio ( .) about the pleasant weather here. \u201cI can\u2019t say I brought the \u2014 well, yes, I brought the sun.

        "TUSCALOOSA, Ala. \u2014 America\u2019s most prominent public universities were founded to serve the people of their states, but they are enrolling record numbers of students from elsewhere to maximize tuition revenue as state support for higher education withers. The shift has buttressed the finances and reshaped the profile of schools across the country, from the University of California\u2019s famed campuses in Berkeley and Los Angeles to the universities of Arkansas, Oregon, Missouri, South Carolina and numerous other places.",
        "SAN SALVADOR \u2014 In a cramped apartment in a slum blighted by warring gangs, Stefanie Ramirez listened as a doctor rubbed her pregnant belly and spoke gently about what was happening to her unborn child \u2014 and to her country.

He is a Washington Post columnist, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and a professor at Georgetown University. DES MOINES The Republican campaign for the 2016 presidential nomination has become a carnival, a comedy hour and, for many in the party, a horror show. Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, the two leading candidates in Monday\u2019s Iowa caucuses, are despised by most of the party\u2019s leaders."
