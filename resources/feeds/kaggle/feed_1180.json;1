        "A steady drip of comments just before the Iowa caucuses has left little doubt: Many former Obama aides consider Hillary Clinton his natural heir. One former staffer put it pretty directly, saying that Bernie Sanders\u2019s campaign \u201cresembles Howard Dean\u2019s a lot more than it resembles Barack Obama\u2019s. \u201d It was a clear shorthand for \u201cinsurgent who lost\u201d \u2014 fair enough. Obama\u2019s the insurgent who won, right? But that isn\u2019t really the whole story. The Obama organization\u2019s strength eight years ago came from its unlikely and somehow functional mix of insurgents and insiders.",
        "I\u2019ve always been one of the most maternal women I know. I\u2019ve quipped for decades \u201cJewish mother in training\u201d while offering sunscreen or a sweater or more food to someone I thought needed it. In my teens and 20s, I told anyone who would listen that if I made it to 30 or 35 without meeting him, I\u2019d go to a bar or a friend or a sperm bank so I could be a mom. News of a friend\u2019s miscarriage or a celebrity\u2019s infertility brought me visceral pain.",
        "MANY \u201cISMS\u201d have been invoked to describe Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, or to define its ideology: nativism, protectionism, racism and, of course, fascism. There\u2019s an element of truth, as well as hyperbole, in each of these descriptors; but none quite captures the essence of Mr. Trump\u2019s improbable, troubling, run. For that, you have to bring in another \u201cism\u201d: cynicism. Obviously, politics is not for the ingenuous, and never has been. Politicians have been spinning and manipulating voters since George Washington\u2019s time. Few, though, have done so quite as brazenly as Mr. Trump has.",
        "EXIT RIGHT: The People Who Left the Left and Reshaped the American Century By Daniel Oppenheimer Simon & Schuster. 403 pp. $28. Daniel Oppenheimer\u2019s \u201cExit Right\u201d is a flawed book, but it is flawed in the particular way that only great books can be. It fails to fully answer the impossibly ambitious questions it lays out, but its insights are so absorbing that it doesn\u2019t matter. Its stories only partially fit Oppenheimer\u2019s underlying argument, but the prose is so perfect you barely realize it.",
        "RICHMOND \u2014 Virginia\u2019s Republican Party on Saturday scrapped plans to use a party loyalty pledge in the March 1 GOP presidential primary, sending elections officials scrambling because absentee voting was already underway. \u201cWe unanimously voted to rescind it,\u201d John Whitbeck, chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, said after a meeting of the State Central Committee.

He sympathized with their frustrations about the federal government, but he thought calm negotiation was a better strategy. Then on Tuesday, an Oregon State Police trooper shot and killed LaVoy Finicum, a grandfather who acted as the occupiers\u2019 spokesman. Now Soper is furious, and he is calling for people from all over the country to come to Burns to show their outrage at the \u201cambush\u201d of Finicum.",

        "ANKARA, Turkey \u2014 Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned Moscow on Saturday that it would be forced to \u201cendure the consequences\u201d if its jets continue to violate Turkish airspace, after Ankara reported a new border infringement incident by a Russian plane. Turkey said another Russian warplane violated its airspace on Friday despite several warnings \u2014 two months after Turkey\u2019s military shot down a Russian jet for crossing over its territory.

        "We spoke no Portuguese. So on our second day in Salvador, one of the 12 Brazilian cities that hosted the 2014 World Cup, we haggled for an Esporte Clube Bahia soccer jersey by tapping dueling numbers into a calculator. My son, Maverick, pulled 35 reals (about $10) from his backpack and handed it to the street vendor. Then he put on the red, blue and white Bahia jersey. Like magic, our relationship to the people around us changed instantly.",

        "I wasn\u2019t particularly offended when my boyfriend told me: \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t make a good pastor\u2019s wife. \u201d But I was confused. I\u2019d spent 13 years in the closet as a student in private Catholic schools, so I felt like I\u2019d been training for such a role my entire life.

        "DES MOINES \u2014 As the eyes of the nation train on Iowa and voters here prepare to make their final choices, Democratic and Republican presidential candidates began Sunday racing to set expectations for Monday\u2019s caucuses.

        "CHARLES CITY, Iowa \u2014 Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders pulled up to a supporter\u2019s garage in his hulking campaign bus, prepared to give a pep talk to a few dozen devotees who had been tirelessly knocking on doors for him in the final days before the Iowa caucuses. But first he had something to get off his chest.

        "WATERLOO, Iowa A decade ago ago, a trio of political scientists asked voters a powerful question: Why weren\u2019t they voting as much as their neighbors? Alan Gerber, Donald Green, and Christopher Larimer two professors from Yale and one from the University of Northern Iowa wanted to find out whether peer pressure and social norms could drive up voter turnout, so they mailed more than 180, 000 Michigan households a letter telling them that they were part of a study, in which other people would find out if they stayed away from the ballot box.",
