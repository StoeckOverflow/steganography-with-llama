        "It\u2019s hard to exaggerate how much is on the line for Hillary Clinton when Iowans head to their caucuses on Monday night. If Clinton wins, her path to the nomination grows smoother. Even allowing that Sen. Bernie Sanders would likely win New Hampshire\u2019s primary in eight days, Clinton would remain to beat Sanders in Nevada, South Carolina and into the decisive month of March when a bulk of Democratic delegates are allocated. Lose on Monday, however, and the best case scenario for Clinton becomes a protracted delegate battle with Sanders that could extend well beyond March.",
        "Tonight, a few hundred thousand Iowa residents will gather in a couple thousand caucus sites and finally, finally the presidential nomination process. It\u2019s been 44 years since the first presidential caucuses that mattered, and 40 years since both parties held them. And yet, for the 315. 8 million Americans who do not live in Iowa \u2014 and for the slightly smaller millions who live in primary, not caucus, states \u2014 the process perpetually needs explaining. That\u2019s fair enough. Here\u2019s an explainer. What time do the Iowa caucuses start? At 7 p. m. Central time, across the state.",
        "Dear Trump supporters: America hears you. You are angry with the gridlock caused by the petty bickering of professional politicians more interested in being lackeys to lobbyists and other donors than in improving the lives of average Americans. Money, jobs and opportunities seem to flow upstream to those who already have everything, rather than downstream to those most in need. Truly, this is how most Americans feel. The question for this election is: Which candidate will actually do something about it? Who will be our champion?",
        "IOWA CITY \u2014 Ted Cruz is the Bernie Sanders of the Republican race, and Bernie Sanders the Ted Cruz of the Democratic race. No matter how you look at it, three delusions drive both candidates\u2019 campaign narratives. Delusion Number 1: We will transform the country, uniting it behind an expansive agenda that will move the nation\u2019s politics sharply away from center.

        "THE MORNING PLUM: The polling suggests that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton may well be favored to win Iowa (Clinton very narrowly so) which means the chatter may soon turn to the increasing possibility of a general election . Democrats are now beginning to seriously think through how they would go after Trump in the general election. The question is whether in so doing, they are sufficiently reckoning with what may really be driving the Trump phenomenon.",
        "Over the last week, I learned that supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) will melt the pixels on your computer screen if you criticize him, don\u2019t sufficiently #feelthebern or say something favorable about Hillary Clinton. Meanwhile, backers of the former secretary of state and 2008 presidential candidate are no slouches in smacking down her detractors, especially those consumed by the Bern they feel. And then there are the protectors of the legacy of President Obama who aren\u2019t happy with the daylight Sanders is putting between himself and the man he hopes to succeed.",
        "Does this scenario sound familiar? In a popular uprising, voters rally behind an insurgent outsider candidate. The establishment panics and tries to quash the outsider\u2019s campaign.
