        "MANCHESTER, N. H. Wednesday night\u2019s televised town hall with Hillary Clinton featured the candidate at her best \u2014 and her worst. Clinton and her campaign ought to study the lessons of both. Ruth Marcus is a columnist for The Post, specializing in American politics and domestic policy. View Archive Facebook RSS The candidate at her worst was obvious, and all the more painful for its predictability. When Clinton is pressed on donations and hefty speaking fees from Wall Street, she reverts to a reflexive defensiveness that hurts her cause.",
        "It is the nature of our political environment that the best performance of one\u2019s career can be ignored \u2014 and ruined \u2014 because of a single remark. Hillary Clinton was sailing along in the Democratic town hall hosted by CNN Wednesday night, sounding thoughtful and at ease when \u2014 bam! \u2014 the viral disaster ensued: ANDERSON COOPER: One of the things that Sen. [Bernie] Sanders points to and a lot of your critics point to is you made three speeches for Goldman Sachs. You were paid $675, 000 for three speeches. Was that a mistake?",
        "If U. S. and British negotiators have their way, MI5, the British domestic security service, could one day go directly to American companies like Facebook or Google with a wiretap order for the chats of British suspects in a counterterrorism investigation. The transatlantic allies have this month quietly begun negotiations on an agreement that would enable the British government to serve wiretap orders directly on U. S. communication firms for live intercepts in criminal and national security investigations involving its own citizens. The British would also be able to serve orders to obtain stored data, such as emails.",
        "MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa \u2014 Only a few minutes into a hastily scheduled press conference in a weight room here, Donald Trump is already on the attack. Against a reporter, of course. \u201cIn 1999, you said you were in all respects,\u201d NBC newsman Peter Alexander starts to ask Trump about a \u201cMeet the Press\u201d interview. Trump doesn\u2019t wait for the question. \u201cRead the full statement!\u201d he shoots back. \u201cYou didn\u2019t read the full statement. What did I say?",

        "In conversation, as in their work, sibling filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen are known for a kind of uncanny symbiosis. Their sentences run together as effortlessly as they divide the writing, directing and producing duties they have shared over the course of 17 feature films, beginning with their 1984 thriller, \u201cBlood Simple,\u201d and culminating in their new satire of 1950s Hollywood, \u201cHail, Caesar!\u201d So it seemed reasonable to ask, as they began a recent interview on a conference call from Los Angeles, that each brother identify himself before speaking.",
        "If you want an Ivy League education, you could fork over $200 grand or so and go to Cornell or Harvard for four years. Alternatively, you could save a ton of cash by simply reading the same books Ivy League students are assigned. That became easier recently with the release of the Open Syllabus Explorer, an online database of books assigned in over 1 million college courses over the past decade or so.

        "When Brazilian health official Claudio Maierovitch in December first raised the idea of asking women to delay their pregnancies because of the Zika virus, it came as a shock. Women rights groups decried what they saw as unprecedented government meddling in what should be a private matter. Doctors questioned the practicality of the advice. And some political experts took it as a desperate sign that the country lacked a coherent strategy to fight the rapidly spreading virus. But then Ecuador followed suit. And Colombia, Jamaica and El Salvador.",
        "The Obama administration is preparing for possible airdrops of humanitarian relief over besieged areas of Syria, where hundreds of thousands of people have been cut off for months from food and medicine and are at risk of starvation. Administration officials emphasized that airdropped relief is only in the planning stages and has not yet been approved. But U. S. forces, who have conducted similar operations in northern Iraq and Syria, could move within days to implement a decision. U. S. and coalition aircraft began bombing Islamic areas elsewhere in Syria 18 months ago.",
        "CONCORD, N. H. \u2014 For the Democratic presidential candidates, there are two urgent campaigns underway in New Hampshire. The first is over the size of what Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders agree is a likely Sanders victory here: Clinton is pulling out every stop to shrink what the latest polls show is a gap of 20 percentage points or more, while Sanders is striving for a win that would give his candidacy fresh momentum.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 For the next few nights, Tuane Rocha, a tall, radiant samba queen, will be dancing naked in the streets of this city, wearing only body paint. Mind you, she will take precautions. \u201cFirst I\u2019m going to put on a layer of repellent,\u201d she said. \u201cThen makeup. Then the paint. \u201d Rocha dances fast \u2014 really fast.

        "CALGARY \u2014 Here in the city where Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas was born, many Canadians give less than a hockey puck about whether their native son is eligible to be the U. S. president. Many of them are just glad he\u2019s not running for anything in Canada. \u201cI just don\u2019t think he\u2019s reasonable.

        "Danielle Allen is a political theorist at Harvard University and a contributing columnist for The Post. After Thursday night\u2019s debate, I\u2019ve got a piece of unsolicited advice for Hillary Clinton. Don\u2019t use this line again: \u201cSenator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president, as exemplifying the establishment. \u201d The problem with the remark is obvious. Clinton does not merely exemplify the establishment. She and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, are the Democratic Party establishment. We\u2019re in the realm of description, not characterization.",
        "The Hillary Clinton email issue is developing into a real whodunit, complete with Clintonesque legal semantics. \u201cI never sent or received any material marked classified,\u201d she said with respect to the discovery of classified information on her private, unclassified email server. That surface denial nearly rivals Bill Clinton\u2019s classic: \u201cI did not have sexual relations with that woman. \u201d But this is no laughing matter.

        "DURHAM, N. H.

        "CONGRESS WISELY acted last year to keep faith with thousands of Afghans who worked side by side with U. S. and international forces in the war of the past decade and a half. The defense authorization bill, which President Obama signed in November, provided for 3, 000 more visas for these courageous translators, interpreters and others to enter the United States and avoid potentially deadly reprisals, after they complete a application process. This benevolent act has now been complicated by ambiguity in the legislative language and a State Department decision on how to interpret it.",
