        "FLINT, Mich. \u2014 It kills him to say it, but Darren Bentley is thinking about leaving town. He was born here, went to Kearsley High School and rents a placenear a couple of college campuses. He has never lived anywhere else. His father worked at the old Fisher Body plant. So did an uncle and both grandfathers. His grandmother worked on the line at Flint Metal Fabricating.",
        "They zip and dart across the sky in a formation, a apparition in a commercial touting the achievements of defense contractor Northrop Grumman. Unlike modern jets, such as the Raptor or Fighting Falcon, they have no tail and are likely to be armed with lasers that are straight out of a movie. They\u2019re fighters, and Northrop Grumman appears poised to show them off during Super Bowl Sunday. The defense titan released a new commercial online Friday that touts its achievements and includes a glitzy glimpse at a plane whose fielding is likely decades away.",
        "A target of bullying, Natalie Keepers cut her arms and harbored suicidal thoughts in middle school. She learned to cope through therapy and medication in high school. But moving to Virginia Tech for college triggered new emotional distress. She sought counseling, help that ended just four months into her freshman year, she said. It is common for students to have challenges in transitioning to college, and many among the millions of students at the nation\u2019s schools seek counseling help as they move to adulthood and life on their own.",
        "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Peyton Manning comes into Super Bowl 50 as if he\u2019s an old car puttering and chugging to a last gas station stop with smoke pouring out of the hood. As if he\u2019s just a rust patch away from being up on blocks and salvaged for parts. As if he\u2019s junk. Don\u2019t buy it. This is still \u201cP freaking M,\u201d as Carolina Panthers cornerback Josh Norman calls him. This is a guy who can sell you on anything. He can sell you an jingle until it goes around in your head like a carousel horse.",
        "The public and private rhythms of the White House have shaped John Wrory Ficklin\u2019s daily life from the day he was born. On Nov. 22, 1963, the day John F. Kennedy was shot and killed in Dallas, Ficklin was 7 and playing at a neighbor\u2019s house when his friend\u2019s mother told him he needed to hurry home. At the time, his father, also named John, was the White House maitre d\u2019 and very close to the center of the unfolding national tragedy.",
        "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 After days of cold, a fitful sunlight emerged above the foothills of the Hindu Kush and schoolchildren in Peshawar took to the playground to play cricket and soccer. Zeeshan Jehangir, 14, and his two best friends were not among them. The three \u2014 dressed in school uniforms \u2014 huddled on the stairs and planned out how it would be when the gunmen came for them. Which part of the school wall could they scale the fastest? Where could they hide? Should they pool their pocket money and buy a pistol?",
        "CHICAGO \u2014 A white Chicago police officer who fatally shot a black college student and accidentally killed a neighbor has filed a lawsuit against the teenager\u2019s estate, arguing the shooting left him traumatized. The highly unusual suit was filed Friday in the middle of the city\u2019s effort to grapple with serious questions about the future of its police force.

        "As Bernie Sanders prepares to take the legendary stage of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d he is undoubtedly hoping to come off as likable, and, most importantly, funny. And it\u2019s safe to assume that the Democratic presidential candidate would also like his appearance to translate into actual votes. [Bernie Sanders headed to New York for \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 cameo] But has the \u201cSNL\u201d strategy worked in the past? Well \u2026 .

        "CONCORD, N. H. \u2014 The question at the most recent Democratic presidential debate was this: Which of your many policy proposals would be Job One if you were elected? Hillary Clinton\u2019s answer to that straightforward query was anything but. \u201cI\u2019m for a lot of things,\u201d she told moderator Chuck Todd. \u201cIf I\u2019m so fortunate to get the nomination, I will begin to work immediately on putting together an agenda, beginning to talk with members of Congress and others about how we can push forward.",
        "\u201cSo tell me about this girl,\u201d I say to my guy friend, casually. My eyes are bright, my body language relaxed, but I\u2019m feeling slightly sick to my stomach. I\u2019m praying he\u2019ll shrug and say \u201cwhat girl?\u201d or \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to tell\u201d and mean it. Rather than telling him that I feel most like myself in his presence or make a play for his heart, I play the best friend. The confidante. I nod when he tells me where she works. I suggest great dinner spots and sweet gestures she might find charming.",
        "At this point in the year, your gym is probably packed with newbies taking a little too long on the treadmill, creating lines for the coveted machine. Since sprinting up an inclined treadmill looks way fiercer than gliding along on an elliptical trainer, you\u2019re willing to wait. But with an equal amount of effort, experts say, you are likely to reap similar results from both machines. Ellipticals combine the fluidity of running and motion of cycling, making them ideal for people with joint pain or who are overweight, according to the American Council on Exercise.",
        "Imagine the coziest spot to watch the Super Bowl: a cushy long sofa, a table full of snacks, a bar stocked with craft beers, a giant TV and a crackling fireplace with real wood burning, providing a woodsy scent and a warm glow. \u201cPeople love to see the Super Bowl with the fireplace on,\u201d says Anthony \u201cAnkie\u201d Barnes, a partner in Barnes Vanze Architects in the District. \u201cWhen people imagine their dream family room, they think of a fireplace being a major part of it.

Each of the top three finishers in Iowa \u2014 Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) billionaire developer Donald Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) \u2014 will begin the final push here with important questions surrounding their candidacies.

        "Hillary Clinton had a chance to put to rest swirling questions about her paid speeches to groups such as Goldman Sachs during last week\u2019s final debate before Tuesday\u2019s primary in New Hampshire.

In the summer of 2014, my best friend, a man I\u2019d come to love and respect during my time reporting here, was taken prisoner by the militants. We were more like brothers than friends, and I haven\u2019t heard from him since. I was filming about 180 miles away on the evening he disappeared.

        "Pickett\u2019s charge. Waterloo. The Charge of the Light Brigade. Take your pick of historical analogies, the \u201cexperience\u201d wing of the Republican Party launched a desperate, and very possibly doomed, assault at Saturday\u2019s GOP debate, during a climatic moment for a GOP race that has been dominated by men who have significantly less policymaking credibility. The polls say that the forces of experience will probably leave New Hampshire in defeat, and even if they pulled something out, racking up victories in future primaries would be hard.",
        "Of the many people Donald Trump praises in his 1987 book \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d one of the first is Mario Cuomo, who was then governor of New York and one of the more estimable liberals in the country. Cuomo, Trump writes, was \u201ca winner and a good guy at that. \u201d He wasn\u2019t the last Democrat who got some love in \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d or in the broader Trump oeuvre.

        "A couple of weeks after I began lecturing on Islam at New York City mosques, something strange happened. Acquaintances and congregants told me they\u2019d been approached by law enforcement officers who asked about me and my talks. Soon after, I began to notice suspicious people in the audiences. One gentleman stood out \u2014 he was the most frequent attendee, but he regularly fell asleep while I spoke. It was 2003. I was enrolled at Brooklyn College, studying English literature.

        "Durham, N. H. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the New Hampshire primary, and some potent myths and misunderstandings have grown up about the Granite State\u2019s political process over the past century. To begin with, New Hampshire, which prides itself on having the nation\u2019s first primary every four years, got into the game late, after Wisconsin and Florida. When New Hampshire held its first one, it was tied for second on the calendar with Minnesota, a week behind Indiana. Since 1920, its primary has been first in the nation, and the state has fought to keep that position.",
