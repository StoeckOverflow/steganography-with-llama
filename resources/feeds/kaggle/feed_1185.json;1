        "Air travelers are about to get their best shot in four years at fixing everything that\u2019s wrong with flying \u2014 or they would if they\u2019d been invited to the party. Sometime next week, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is expected to consider the FAA reauthorization bill, which funds the Federal Aviation Administration, among other things. At a markup session, where changes to the law are considered, various special interests will push to include their amendments. The bill, introduced Wednesday, spends the bulk of its 273 pages dealing with air traffic control reform issues.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Across Latin America, calls to loosen some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the world in the face of the Zika virus outbreak are gaining momentum but encountering strong and entrenched opposition. In El Salvador, where abortions are banned under any circumstance, the health minister has argued for a revision of the law because of the dangers the virus poses to fetal development. In Colombia, an organized movement to lift restrictions on abortion has gained allies in the government but has run into determined opposition from religious authorities.",

        "BALTIMORE \u2014 The relief hearing for convicted Baltimore killer and \u201cSerial\u201d star Adnan Syed was supposed to last two days. It was then rescheduled for three, which then became four, or more \u2014 on Monday, it forged ahead \u2014 as the bailiff continued to prowl the aisle for illicit cellphones and reporters doggedly exhausted their notebook reserves, and attorneys nitpicked and swanned their way through witness after witness in a big maroon courtroom, and it turned out that one of the players was not a person but the world\u2019s most popular podcast, with 80 million downloads.",

        "For a guy running against the establishment, Bernie Sanders sure seems to crave its approval. In New Hampshire last week, the Democratic presidential candidate put out an ad touting his endorsements that gave the false impression that two local newspapers \u2014 the Nashua Telegraph and the Valley News \u2014 had endorsed him. An early version of the ad overtly claimed the papers had endorsed him. They had done no such thing. Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation\u2019s capital.

        "Adapting \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d Michael Lewis\u2019s dense book about the housing bubble and financial crisis, for the big screen ought to have been an impossible task. But Adam McKay, whose always slyly political comedies have become blunter as the years have gone on, pulled it off, making a movie that, believe it or not, is at its funniest when guiding audiences through complicated financial concepts like synthetic collateralized debt obligations.",
        "The big political story of the day is the continued fallout from Marco Rubio\u2019s performance in Saturday night\u2019s Republican debate, when he repeated a particular line about Barack Obama multiple times, even after being ridiculed by Chris Christie for doing so. This has led to all kinds of uncomplimentary questions about Rubio. But what\u2019s missing is the context \u2014 exactly what Rubio was trying to argue, and where it comes from.",

        "New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie pummeled Sen. Marco Rubio ( .) for being overly scripted during the New Hampshire debate, pouncing when Rubio, for the third time, repeated his stock line that President \u201cObama knows exactly what he is doing\u201d by moving the country to the left. \u201cThere it is, there it is,\u201d Christie declared. \u201cThe memorized speech. There it is, everybody!\u201d It\u2019s the moment everyone is talking about. But there is one small problem. While Christie attacked Rubio for using memorized, scripted lines, the governor used his own memorized, scripted lines during the very same debate.",
        "ASSESSING THE behavior of North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un is necessarily a matter of guesswork. In light of North Korea\u2019s launch Sunday of another rocket, however, our favorite theory is a simple one: Mr. Kim is responding rationally, even shrewdly, to the outside world. The dictator no doubt noticed that after the regime\u2019s latest nuclear test, on Jan. 6, there was no response other than rhetoric from the U. N. Security Council, China and the United States. Moreover, he surely observed that his provocation served to widen a rift between Washington and Beijing over how to handle him.",
        "In late October, the film director Spike Lee visited the National Basketball Association\u2019s Manhattan headquarters to discuss a bold idea. He had, for months, wanted to produce a commercial that would denounce gun violence in America. It is perhaps the most polarizing subject in the country, but Lee \u2014 who already had ESPN president John Skipper behind the idea \u2014 was aiming high: He wanted to include NBA stars and have the support of the league itself. A few days after the meeting, Lee had Commissioner Adam Silver\u2019s answer: Yes. But that wasn\u2019t all.",
        "The boy was inside his Tennessee mobile home, talking with three girls who were standing outside. The group included McKayla Dyer and her sister, who was also 11, according to court documents. During the conversation that night, Oct. 3, the boy asked the girls to go get their puppies. The girls declined. The boy left. When he returned, the documents state, he was carrying a BB gun and shotgun. There appears to be no statistics keeping track of how many U. S. children fire a gun and intentionally or unintentionally harm someone.",
        "Federal prosecutors filed charges Monday against an Iraqi woman accused of taking hostage an American aid worker who was killed last year in Syria. The Iraqi woman, known as Umm Sayyaf or Nisreen Assad Ibrahim Bahar, was captured in May in a U. S. commando raid in eastern Syria. Her husband, a senior Islamic State terrorist, was killed in the assault. Sayyaf was charged with conspiring to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization resulting in death in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia.",
        "The Blacksburg, Va. girl who was abducted and killed last month told friends that the Virginia Tech student accused in her slaying was her boyfriend and talked of running away and starting a family with him, a friend said. Nicole Lovell described David Eisenhauer, 18, as \u201cfunny and really nice\u201d in the weeks leading up to her Jan. 27 disappearance. And Eisenhauer, who is charged with murder in Nicole\u2019s death, appeared to be a conscientious engineering student during the period in which prosecutors said he and another Virginia Tech freshman plotted the slaying.",
        "A massive storm exploded in intensity just off the Southeast coast on Sunday afternoon, driving hurricane force winds and whipping waves into a frenzy. And in the middle of this monster storm was a comparatively tiny cruise ship on its way to Florida \u2014 rocking, roiling and taking a major beating from the most powerful storm we\u2019ve seen in the western Atlantic so far this winter. A large trough in the jet stream had been pushing toward the East Coast late last week.",
        "Joel Barajas was the only Crystal City council member to show up at the office Friday. That\u2019s because everyone else he works with is facing felony charges.

        "Local authorities in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu are investigating whether the death of a man at a college campus over the weekend was the result of a falling meteorite. A blast at Bharathidasan Engineering College left a crater in the ground and blew out glass windows in nearby buildings. A bus driver who was standing close to the site perished; a number of others, including a gardener and a student, were injured. After investigators couldn\u2019t find any evidence of explosives, some concluded that the cause of the blast could have been extraterrestrial.",
        "MANCHESTER, N. H. \u2014 The presidential nomination battle between Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton moved decisively Wednesday to a fight for African Americans\u2019 votes, as the two candidates touted dueling endorsements to bolster their standing within the community. The flurry of activity underscored how the massive wins by Sanders and Republican billionaire Donald Trump in New Hampshire have reshuffled the presidential race yet again. Even as Trump and Sanders worked to build momentum for their campaigns, some other contenders were left reassessing their strategies.",
        "The Congressional Black Caucus is rushing to defend Hillary Clinton, following what many black lawmakers said was an expected loss in New Hampshire but one that should not hurt her in the next round of voting. On Thursday morning, the CBC\u2019s leaders will appear at the Democratic National Committee to formally endorse Clinton for president, through the CBC political action committee. The group will then disburse its lawmakers to states where black voters are crucial, particularly in South Carolina\u2019s Democratic primary on Feb. 27. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to endorse and do nothing.",
        "Perhaps the Clinton campaign\u2019s internal polling had, by this weekend, made it clear just how poorly Hillary Clinton was doing among New Hampshire women. Maybe that triggered some kind of distress signal broadcast to Clinton\u2019s female supporters and surrogates. Maybe that helped set in motion the entire Madeleine Clinton fiasco this week. But now, with the New Hampshire primary done, Clinton\u2019s rather dire situation with women \u2014 particularly young white women in that state \u2014 is pretty clear for all to see. Clinton did not simply lose New Hampshire on Tuesday night to Sen.",
        "It\u2019s hard to imagine the New Hampshire primary going any worse for establishment Republicans. Desperate to find a candidate to coalesce around in hopes of stopping the populist insurrection of Donald Trump and the conservative uprising championed by Ted Cruz, the establishment instead got the opposite: a split decision between John Kasich, Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio that ensures an extended, nasty and expensive fight simply to emerge as the third guy in the top tier.",

        "There are many stories one could tell about Bernie Sanders\u2019 defeat of Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire. One is that Sanders has captured the prevailing sentiment among Democrats, a fervent desire for political revolution to unmake a corrupt system, and he will ride this desire all the way to the nomination.",
        "You cannot understand the vulnerable state of the U. S. and global economies \u2014 and nervous stock markets \u2014 without coming to grips with the crash of \u201c \u201d countries. Led by China, these are countries that, along with the poorest countries, account for 85 percent of the world\u2019s population and 60 percent of the global economy, according to Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund. In many ways, their voyage into the global marketplace is a triumph.",
        "The conservatism that has dominated the Republican Party for decades is in crisis. Capitalism has lost its allure among a large swath of young Americans. And the Clinton and Bush brands are yesterday\u2019s products in desperate need of renovation. These are, admittedly, large conclusions to draw from one contest in one small New England state. But politicians and Wall Street would be foolish to ignore New Hampshire\u2019s shock waves. E. J. Dionne writes about politics in a column and on the PostPartisan blog.",
        "In a devastating outcome for Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire, this was the most unkindest cut of all: Women flocked to Bernie Sanders. Not by single digits, but by a margin of 55 percent to 44 percent. These numbers matter, and not, as Shakespeare wrote of Brutus stabbing Caesar, because \u201cingratitude, more strong than traitors\u2019 arms, quite vanquish\u2019d him. \u201d Clinton is not vanquished by what she and her supporters may see as female voters\u2019 ingratitude; she will soldier on.
