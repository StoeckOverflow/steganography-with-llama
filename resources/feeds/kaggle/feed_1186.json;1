        "After decades of investigation, Paul Schrade has no doubt about the identity of the man who shot him in the head shortly after midnight on June 5, 1968, in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel: It was Sirhan Sirhan, the same gunman convicted of assassinating Robert F. Kennedy. And yet, when Schrade comes face to face with Sirhan for the first time in 50 years, at a parole hearing in San Diego on Wednesday, he is expected to argue that the notorious gunman wasn\u2019t Kennedy\u2019s killer, according to Shane O\u2019Sullivan, author of \u201cWho Killed Bobby?",
        "When \u201cHarry Potter\u201d fans first heard that J. K. Rowling was writing a sequel to her beloved series, they couldn\u2019t wait to get their hands on the book. Then they realized the sequel wasn\u2019t going to be released in book form \u2014 she had turned it into a play. \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child\u201d is set to debut in London at the Palace Theatre on Harry\u2019s birthday, July 30.

        "The Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly passed legislation that would impose mandatory sanctions on North Korea, in a bid aimed at forcing the international community to retaliate more strongly against the rogue nation after a series of worrisome moves. Since North Korea announced its fourth nuclear test in early January, it has launched a satellite into space over international objections, and a top U. S. intelligence official has warned that Pyongyang is perhaps only weeks from recovering plutonium from its restarted Yongbyun reactor. Yet none of these steps seem to have broken a logjam at the U. N.",
        "Don\u2019t shoot the messenger, but another tricky winter weather situation is unfolding for early next week. A shot of frigid, Arctic air will set the stage for wintry precipitation Monday into Tuesday. Whether the precipitation will stay in some type of frozen variety through the event remains highly uncertain, but the models are unanimous in forecasting the storm to begin as snow on Monday. After the weekend cold air outbreak, ground temperatures will be so even a dusting of snow has the potential to make the roads very slippery.",

Kerry searched Thursday for common ground amid stalled Syrian peace efforts, holding meetings with a key Syrian opposition envoy and Russia\u2019s foreign minister even as Moscow pressed ahead with airstrikes to aid its ally in Damascus. Kerry\u2019s outreach faces considerable challenges. Russia and the Syrian opposition appear far apart, threatening the wider efforts to find a political path to end five years of conflict in Syria.",

C. \u2014 Here\u2019s a story, the gist of which will sound familiar to anyone living in South Carolina: Natalie Barrett, a schoolteacher from Westminster, got a earlier this month and ended up furious. It started off simple enough, an automated man\u2019s voice asking her age and gender, then quizzing her on which Republican candidates she liked. But when she selected Sen.

        "Scientists announced Thursday that they have succeeded in detecting gravitational waves from the violent merging of two black holes in deep space. The detection was hailed as a triumph for a controversial, exquisitely crafted, physics experiment and as confirmation of a key prediction of Albert Einstein\u2019s General Theory of Relativity. It will also inaugurate a new era of astronomy in which gravitational waves are tools for studying the most mysterious and exotic objects in the universe, scientists declared at a euphoric news briefing at the National Press Club in Washington.",

        "The New Hampshire results have solidified the reigning cliche that the 2016 campaign is an revolt of both the left and the right. Largely overlooked, however, is the role played in setting the national mood by the legacy of the Obama presidency. Yes, you hear constant denunciations of institutions, parties, leaders, donors, lobbyists, influence peddlers. But the starting point of the bipartisan critique is the social, economic and geopolitical wreckage all around us.",

In this state, Trump is riding a wave of adulation more common for rock stars, faith healers or South American dictators.

        "Is Bernie Sanders a closet foreign policy \u201crealist\u201d? Reading his few pronouncements on foreign policy, you sense that he embraces the realists\u2019 deep skepticism about U. S. military intervention. But he has said so little about foreign policy that it\u2019s hard to be sure. Foreign policy is the hole in Sanders\u2019s political doughnut. We know what he doesn\u2019t like \u2014 the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which he mentions, in nearly every debate, almost robotically, describing it as \u201cone of the worst foreign policy blunders in the modern history of the United States.",

And we agree: The United States can and should learn from the experience of other Western democracies, whether that implies a bigger government or, as is sometimes the case abroad, a smaller one.

But as the president moves into his last year in office, a new reality has set in: those controversial funds still exist, and likely will remain under whoever replaces Obama in the White House next year.
