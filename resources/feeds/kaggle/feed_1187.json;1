        "GREENVILLE, S. C. \u2014 The 2016 campaign has bewildered and captivated George W. Bush. At home in Dallas, the 43rd president rises before dawn and reads political news online. He fires off emails to his old advisers to check on the latest gossip. He tunes into the debates, even though they stretch past his bedtime. In private and among friends, Bush and his wife, Laura, express amazement at an election season that has been hijacked by Donald Trump.",
        "HAVANA \u2014 Pope Francis made a brief stopover in Cuba for a historic encounter Friday with the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, a meeting that bridged a nearly rift in Christianity but whose focus was believed to be the current turmoil in the Middle East. The conversation between Francis and Patriarch Kirill I marked the first meeting between the religious leaders of the Vatican and Moscow since a 11th century Christian schism over papal authority and other disputes.",
        "It is the line that might have sunk a presidential campaign. \u201c[Barack Obama] knows exactly what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio ( .) said at Saturday\u2019s debate (again and again and again). \u201c[He] is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country, to make America more like the rest of the world. \u201d Rubio\u2019s sin is said to be stylistic. He repeated the phrasing almost robotically. But what about the substance of what he said? The charge that President Obama is attempting to change America fundamentally is a staple of talk shows.",
        "President Obama this week showed why his legacy both on domestic and foreign policy will be scant. On the domestic front, the president, unable to work constructively with Congress, has chosen to move unilaterally by means of executive power grabs. His action on delayed deportation has already been halted by the courts. This week his regulatory move on climate change was dealt a blow. The Post reported: The Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked a key part of President Obama\u2019s ambitious proposal to limit carbon emissions and reduce global warming while the plan is challenged.",
        "Much of Hillary Clinton\u2019s difficulty in this campaign stems from a single, unalterable fact: She is a woman. I\u2019m not referring primarily to the Bernie Bros, those Bernie Sanders supporters who fill the Internet with misogynistic filth about Clinton. What drags down her candidacy is more pervasive and far subtler \u2014 unconscious, even. Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation\u2019s capital. He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000. View Archive Facebook Google+ RSS The criticism is the same as in 2008: She doesn\u2019t connect. She isn\u2019t likeable. She doesn\u2019t inspire. She seems shrill.",
        "At last night\u2019s debate, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton got into an extended scuffle on immigration after he whacked her for supposedly wanting to send back the children who recently dominated the news after migrating unaccompanied from Central America. She denied this charge, pointing out that she wanted due process for them here, while also noting that full amnesty for them risked sending a message that might encourage others to send children on the dangerous journey northward. But perhaps the most notable moment of the exchange was this, from Sanders: \u201cWe\u2019ve got 11 million undocumented people in this country.",
        "GAZIANTEP, Turkey \u2014 Questions about how and when a Syrian truce will be implemented deepened skepticism that the will work, as Russian and Syrian warplanes on Friday sustained their relentless bombardment of territory in the country. Syrian opposition groups cautiously welcomed the deal reached by world powers at a meeting in Munich on Thursday but said they were concerned that it allows Russia to continue its air campaign against the Islamic State and Jabhat terrorist groups \u2014 and perhaps also against moderate rebels.",
        "Two students died in a shooting at a high school in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale on Friday morning, authorities said. \u201cThis is a tragic incident,\u201d Glendale police spokeswoman Tracey Breeden said during a news conference. \u201cTwo young people are dead this morning and we send our condolences to the family, the loved ones and the friends of those two young girls. \u201d Breeden said two female students had each been shot once and were found next to each other with the weapon beside them on the campus of Independence High School.",
        "* Winter weather advisory 6 p. m. to midnight * 6:30 p. m. update: Snow is being slow to move into the area. It\u2019s mostly hanging out west of the Blue Ridge, but should edge into western locations over the next hour. The slow movement probably argues for a later arrival in the immediate area than earlier estimates, perhaps more like between 8 and 9 p. m. around the Beltway. This activity is mainly light, but we\u2019ve seen reports of moderate bursts in places like Martinsburg, West Virginia. 5:50 p. m.",
        "Everyone thought Apple was making a big music play in 2014 when it bought Beats Electronics and launched a relationship with rapper and Beats Dr. Dre. But what began as a $3 billion acquisition of a music brand is apparently broadening to online TV as well. Apple is taking a page out of Netflix and Amazon\u2019s playbook, creating an original TV series called \u201dVital Signs\u201d featuring none other than Dre himself, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which quoted multiple anonymous sources on the matter.",
        "Many students are in an uproar over a change to the ACT that has yielded what they call inexplicably low scores on the essay section of the nation\u2019s most widely used college admission test. Controversy erupted soon after the ACT introduced a revised task in September that is being graded for the first time on the same scale as the rest of the test. Counselors across the country are complaining that many of their top students, who routinely earn marks higher than 30 on other parts of the ACT, are getting writing scores in the 20s.",
        "When is a word sexist and when is a word that could be construed as sexist simply, well, accurate? This is a tricky question the political press is grappling with \u2014 and will continue to \u2014 as Hillary Clinton wages a campaign that increasingly requires her to draw sharp contrasts with her opponent in debates and on the campaign trail. When the former secretary of state makes a forceful argument, when she goes after Bernie Sanders, when she becomes animated, how should journalists describe her?",
        "BURBANK, Calif. \u2014 President Obama will be across the country from the first lady on Valentine\u2019s Day. But he sent her a steamy love poem \u2014 on \u201dThe Ellen DeGeneres Show.\u201d \u201dSomeone call the Situation Room because things are about to get hot,\u201d Obama said while filming the video mash note on stage, between vases of red roses in Ellen\u2019s Burbank studio.

        "Poverty has a way of rearing its ugly head, slipping into the cracks in people\u2019s lives when they\u2019re young and then later in life. Sometimes it happens in ways that are easily observable \u2014 what poor babies are fed, for instance, has been shown to alter what they crave as adults, creating affinities for foods that might be better left uneaten. But sometimes the influences are hidden, and all the more insidious as a result.",

        "For 30 years, Edgar Latulip was gone. He didn\u2019t remember his own name or realize he was living 80 miles from home, where he was listed as a missing person and where there were competing theories about how and where he had most likely died. No one had seen him since September 1986 when, according to news accounts, Latulip disappeared from a Canadian group home, got on a bus bound for the south side of Lake Ontario and forgot almost everything. He assumed a new identity. He settled in a new city. He built a new life.",
        "In Mauritania, only one train exists: It is nicknamed the Iron Train.

        "Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, the intellectual cornerstone of the court\u2019s modern conservative wing, whose elegant and acidic opinions inspired a movement of legal thinkers and ignited liberal critics, died Feb. 13 on a ranch near Marfa, Tex. He was 79. The cause of death was not immediately known. [Reactions on Scalia\u2019s death pour in] In a statement Saturday, Chief Justice John G.

        "State and national Democratic leaders backing Hillary Clinton say that even though the race for the Democratic nomination is moving to states more favorable to her, the former secretary of state must sharpen her message to channel some of the populist fervor that has propelled Sen. Bernie Sanders. Even as these Democrats remain committed to Clinton and express confidence that ultimately she will secure her party\u2019s presidential nomination, many also say that Clinton\u2019s in Iowa and drubbing in New Hampshire exposed weaknesses in her candidacy. Two Democratic elected officials who support Clinton, Gov. Dannel Malloy of Connecticut and Gov.",
        "The six remaining serious candidates for the Republican presidential nomination will gather in Greenville, South Carolina later Saturday for the first Hampshire primary debate. The stakes for the debate, which comes one week before the South Carolina primary, are giant given how decisive the Palmetto State vote has been in other recent Republican presidential fights. To get a lay of the land, I reached out to Andy Shain, The State newspaper\u2019s politics reporter. Our conversation, conducted via email, is below. FIX: Donald Trump starts the sprint to South Carolina as the favorite. Am I right or wrong about that?",
        "As President Obama spoke of the country\u2019s deepening sense of alienation and anger last month, a teacher in Michigan listened, her eyes fixed on the Republicans in the House chamber who in her view represented the problem. \u201cLet\u2019s get over the party lines and work together!\u201d she tweeted during the president\u2019s State of the Union address. In Maryland, a retired lawyer was listening to the exact same words. He, too, was worried about the anger and division gripping the country, but as Obama spoke, his resentment toward the president only swelled.",
        "BAGHDAD \u2014 If breached, it could unleash a wave down the Tigris River basin and drown more than half a million people, with floodwaters reaching as far as the Iraqi capital, about 280 miles to the south. The collapse of Mosul Dam would be catastrophic for Iraq. The dam has been called the most dangerous in the world for the past decade. But recent assessments by the U. S.

        "The security shutters were pulled down at the Under the Sun salon on Georgia Avenue NW when I stopped by at noon Tuesday. Getting your storefront window shattered by gunfire can make a business owner take that kind of action. So, too, can a bullet flying through the front window, grazing the neck of a inside the salon.
