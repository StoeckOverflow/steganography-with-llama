The Saudis have already visited the Turkish base at Incirlik, where U.

        "Congress is considering a freeze on the airline industry\u2019s shrinking coach seats, an unprecedented move that could lead to a more comfortable and humane flying experience. A proposed amendment to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Bill would direct the federal government to set minimum standards for the first time, over the airline industry\u2019s objections. The average distance between rows of seats has dropped from 35 inches before airline deregulation in the 1970s to about 31 inches today. The average width of an airline seat has also shriveled from 18 inches to about 16 inches.",
        "If you look at the ratio of his box office hits to failures over the last 10 years, Ryan Reynolds should be on his way to Hollywood obscurity right now.

A whopping 80 to 90 percent of Americans do not get the recommended minimum of 8 ounces weekly, according to a recent USDA analysis. That means the vast majority of us are not reaping seafood\u2019s health benefits and are probably worse off for it. Eating fish dramatically reduces the chances of dying of a heart attack, improves children\u2019s brain development, slows brain aging, lowers the risk of depression and mood disorders, can help with weight management and more.",

        "Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s sudden death Saturday shifts the dynamic of the Supreme Court and undermines conservative hopes for victories this term on important, highly controversial issues such as abortion, immigration and unions. If Republican leaders hold to their pledge not to confirm anyone President Obama nominates, it could affect the next term as well, having a dramatic impact on the cases an court accepts and decides in the term that begins in October.

        "White House officials began sifting through their pool of potential nominees for the newly vacant seat on the nation\u2019s highest court Sunday, girding for battle with Republicans who are insisting that President Obama leave the choice of a new justice to his successor. But Obama pledged Saturday to nominate a replacement for Justice Antonin Scalia, who died suddenly on Saturday during a hunting trip, and on Sunday, Principal Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz said the White House expected the Senate to give that nomination appropriate consideration when the time came.",
        "President Obama says he\u2019ll nominate a replacement for Justice Antonin Scalia, who was found dead Saturday at a Texas hunting resort. It\u2019s fair to say no matter whom the president picks to replace one of the court\u2019s most conservative justices, he\u2019ll have a fight on his hands to get that person confirmed by the Senate so late in his presidency. But depending which type of Supreme Court candidate he nominates, Obama could make the confirmation fight a little easier or much more difficult for everyone involved \u2014 for him, for the nominee and for Senate Republicans.",
        "The death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia casts a cloud of uncertainty over a Supreme Court term filled with some of the most controversial issues facing the nation: abortion, affirmative action, the rights of religious objectors to the contraceptive mandate in the Affordable Care Act, and the president\u2019s powers on immigration and deportation. An court could split on all of those issues. If the court ties in deciding a case, the decision of the appeals court remains in place, without setting a nationwide precedent.",
        "MARFA, Tex. \u2014 In the cloistered chambers of the U. S. Supreme Court, Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s days were highly regulated and predictable. He met with clerks, wrote opinions and appeared for arguments in the august courtroom on a schedule set months in advance. Yet as details of Scalia\u2019s sudden death trickled in Sunday, it appeared that the hours afterward were anything but orderly. The man known for his elegant legal opinions and profound intellect was found dead in his room at a hunting resort by the resort\u2019s owner, who grew worried when Scalia didn\u2019t appear at breakfast Saturday morning.",
        "In the next few days and weeks, two portraits of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia are almost certain to emerge. [Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia dies at 79] The first and the most common will laud Scalia as a lion of conservative thought and jurisprudence, a man of almost unmatched intellectual heft and commitment to conservative ideals who also maintained real friendships with justices with entirely different worldviews. He will be described as deeply religious and in possession of a healthy sense of humor.",
        "The question comes every time. \u201cExcuse me, but there\u2019s something I don\u2019t understand about Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,\u201d someone will ask my and me at each event since we published \u201cNotorious RBG,\u201d a lighthearted biography of the justice. \u201cHow could she possibly be friends with Scalia?\u201d Now that Senate Republicans have vowed, mere hours after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, to block any Obama nominee to replace him, it\u2019s worth considering the answer.",
        "After Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death Saturday at 79, the Supreme Court is now evenly divided between four liberal justices and four conservatives, even with Anthony Kennedy\u2019s occasional swings. What a moment for Scalia to depart: The court faces a wild array of closely divided decisions. It is an election year. And President Obama has stacked the lower circuit courts with Democrats. Obama has been chewing on his legacy for months. Fate has handed him the opportunity of any presidency \u2014 to swing the balance of the Supreme Court from conservative to liberal.",

Bernie Sanders talks about overthrowing the system \u2014 his campaign \u201cis nothing short of the beginning of a political revolution,\u201d he declared in his New Hampshire victory speech Tuesday night, for instance \u2014 mainstream Democrats roll their eyes. Frankly, you can\u2019t really blame them: They\u2019ve heard this talk before, and it never ends well. Howard Dean in 2004 and Jesse Jackson twice in the 1980s used similar rhetoric to briefly exhilarate, then bitterly polarize, the party before their campaigns imploded.",
        "Last I checked, presidents are elected for four years, not three. Which means President Obama should quickly nominate a replacement for Justice Antonin Scalia. Then the Senate should play its assigned role. For the Senate to shut down the confirmation process would be bad for the court, bad for the country and, ultimately, bad for Republicans.

        "Antonin Scalia, who combined a zest for intellectual combat with a vast talent for friendship, was a Roman candle of sparkling jurisprudential theories leavened by acerbic witticisms. The serrated edges of his most passionate dissents sometimes strained the court\u2019s comity and occasionally limited his ability to proclaim what the late Justice William Brennan called the most important word in the court\u2019s lexicon: \u201cFive.",
        "In most presidential elections, Supreme Court nominations are a major issue for elites and a substantial concern for significant parts of the conservative movement. Other voters usually see the future makeup of the court as a side matter, or not essential to their decisions at all. Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death on Saturday will change this. E. J.

        "Love is patient. Love is kind. Love is. ..detectable on an fMRI scan? Poets have written about love for millennia, but only recently has it become a subject of serious scientific pursuit. Psychologists, biologists, economists and anthropologists are all investigating the role of love in our lives and our culture. The poets, it turns out, have gotten a lot right (for example, the metaphor of love as a kind of madness gained credence when one study found a chemical resemblance between romantic love and disorder ). But we still have a lot to learn.",
        "There is a dark period in American history. It\u2019s one to which some Americans seem eager to return.

        "The rancorous debate over picking a replacement for Justice Antonin Scalia reflects in many ways a growing public skepticism toward the U. S. Supreme Court itself, as its image has evolved from impartial arbiter of the laws to yet another politicized institution. The nation s highest court is not immune from the disillusionment that Americans feel toward all their institutions of government. Increasingly, the assumption seems to be that certain political outcomes are to be expected \u201d and sometimes, even demanded \u201d from the justices. And now, the judiciary s ostensible insulation from politics is wearing even thinner."
