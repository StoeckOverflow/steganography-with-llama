        "The Senate, in all its august wisdom, used to approach nominations to the Supreme Court with a simple standard: If the nominee was qualified and wasn\u2019t a criminal or a drunk, he or she would probably get confirmed with the support of both the president\u2019s party and the opposition. There were exceptions over the years, but most justices got the affirmative votes of even senators who didn\u2019t agree with their political philosophy.",
        "As former president George W. Bush prepares to hit the campaign trail in South Carolina on Monday, the chants of \u201cBush lied, people died\u201d are back.

Moreover, Trump says, Bush knew there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq but lied to the American people to get us into a Middle East war.",
        "Years ago, I attended a small gathering honoring a leading Sicilian politician in Washington. Since I was raised in a Sicilian family, I relished the opportunity to talk about Italian culture and food with an animated paisan. As we drank and toasted with Italian wine, one voice constantly boomed above the rest with a \u201cCent\u2019Anni\u201d toast for everyone to \u201clive 100 years. \u201d It was Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, who regaled the group with his tales and jokes.",

        "Outside the Oval Office is a small rectangular room with two nondescript wooden desks. In one sits President Obama\u2019s personal secretary. In the other is Brian Mosteller, the man who sweats the small stuff so that the president doesn\u2019t have to. Few have even heard of Mosteller, but if you look closely at photographs taken inside the White House, you can often glimpse him at the edge of the frame, omnipresent. From his chair, he is the only person in the White House with a direct view of the president at his desk.",

        "What is likely to be the end of Peyton Manning\u2019s football career is being accompanied by unsavory headlines concerning alleged use of HGH and, now, the details of a sexual assault that allegedly occurred when he was a student at the University of Tennessee. Manning is among athletes named in a lawsuit filed last week by six former female students that alleges that Tennessee violated Title IX by treating assaults by nonchalantly and creating a hostile work environment.",
        "Such is the inanity of life that it includes asking your buddies (and even your GOP presidential contenders) whether or not they would, if possible, travel back in time and snuff out the infant Adolf Hitler. It\u2019s a question that pretends to be philosophical by probing the limits of one\u2019s ability to discern between moral impulse and heroic urge. As an intellectual exercise, the question is barely complex enough to fill the time it takes to wait for a pizza to be delivered to the dorm. Okay, then, here\u2019s another: What about thwarting the assassination of John F. Kennedy?",

C. \u2014 The audience listened as Jeb Bush spent the better part of an hour taking shots at Donald Trump \u2014 comparing the Republican to President Obama, comparing him to Vladimir Putin, calling him a bully, saying he denigrates women and the disabled.

        "Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada, is Senate minority leader. We are entering uncharted waters in the history of the U. S. system of checks and balances, with potentially momentous consequences. Having gridlocked the Senate for years, Republicans now want to gridlock the Supreme Court with a campaign of partisan sabotage aimed at denying the president\u2019s constitutional duty to pick nominees.

        "It\u2019s economists vs. the stock market. Economists generally don\u2019t forecast a recession anytime soon.

But one is that you never really know how the object of your current affections would compare to all the other people you might meet in the future.

You don\u2019t want to marry the first person you meet, but you also don\u2019t want to wait too long. This can be a serious dilemma, especially for people with perfectionist tendencies.",
