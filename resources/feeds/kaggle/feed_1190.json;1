        "Frame Houses and a Billboard, Atlanta, Georgia. Photograph by Walker Evans, March 1936. The Farm Security Administration (FSA) was created in 1937 from an earlier agency named the Resettlement Administration, or RA. The RA had been created by a 1935 executive order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt to help struggling farmers and sharecroppers by providing loans, purchasing depleted farmland and resettling destitute families into communities. Rexford G. Tugwell, a former Columbia University economics professor, was chosen by Roosevelt to lead the RA, and Tugwell appointed his former student and friend Roy K. Stryker to head the agency\u2019s historical section.",
        "Senate Republicans clashed Wednesday over how to battle President Obama\u2019s expected Supreme Court nomination as the White House left open the remote possibility that the president might sidestep a confirmation fight by making a rare recess appointment. Obama has the option, while the Senate is in recess, of naming a replacement for Justice Antonin Scalia, who died Saturday. A recess appointee would serve until the end of the current Congress in January 2017.",
        "COLUMBIA, S. C. \u2014 The conservative movement finally had a presidential candidate it believed could go the distance: Ted Cruz, an adept communicator with deep pockets and a sophisticated national organization. But here in South Carolina, a state for a who appeals to evangelicals, the Texas senator\u2019s ideologically pure candidacy is struggling to overtake the populism of Donald Trump \u2014 and contend with the religious overtures of Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) who on Wednesday picked up the coveted endorsement of Gov. Nikki Haley.",
        "SUMMERVILLE, S. C. \u2014 He\u2019s stuck in the polls and just lost a major endorsement. And now voters are in open panic about the fate of Jeb Bush. The Republican presidential candidate was barraged by conflicting advice from supporters increasingly distressed by the rise of GOP Donald Trump and that the former Florida governor\u2019s campaign has stalled. One guy urged him to talk more about his compassion. Another told him to take Trump\u2019s attacks on the chin and stay substantive. A third man urged him to work harder to spread the word nationally.",
        "CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico \u2014 Overlooking the flood lights and barbed wire that line the U. S. border, Pope Francis on Wednesday quietly prayed for the migrants who have died during their journeys to America, as thousands of people watched on both sides of the Rio Grande\u2019s fortified shores. In what amounted to a symbolic rebuke of America\u2019s presidential campaign rhetoric \u2014 which has included calls for mass deportations of illegal immigrants and a huge border wall \u2014 the pope prayed atop a platform that overlooked the frontier.",
        "Officials at Joint Special Operations Command had found the uncatchable man \u2014 they were sure of it. Mokhtar Belmokhtar, the legendary Algerian militant, had eluded capture across North Africa and the Sahel for a dozen years, defying reports of his death to continue his campaign of kidnappings and guerrilla attacks. The United States and its allies had missed him before.",
        "Sen. Ron Johnson plays a mean game of Twister.",
        "I was born in 1984, the year Walter Mondale selected Geraldine Ferraro to join him on the Democratic ticket, making her the first woman to contend for the presidency or vice presidency with the backing of a major party. I watched Hillary Clinton give her concession speech in 2008. I was covering the Republican National Convention for National Journal when John McCain tapped Sarah Palin to be his running mate, sending me scrambling to the Alaska Women\u2019s Republican Clubs to find out how Palin was regarded in her home state.",
        "As Republican presidential candidates invoke Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s legacy, all insisting that his suddenly vacant seat shouldn\u2019t be filled until a new president is in place, it is helpful to ask: What would Scalia do? First, Scalia would read the law and, without much recommend the obvious intent of Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution, which reads: \u201c[The president] shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . judges of the Supreme Court. \u201d Kathleen Parker writes a column on politics and culture.",
        "If you are only casually following the presidential race, what would you know about Sen. Ted Cruz ( . )? You would hear that none of his fellow senators likes him. You would see Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Sen. Marco Rubio ( .) spend time attacking him for lying and dirty tricks. And you might know he is really now but did not use to be. If you like his overly dramatic, faux preacher style of speaking, that might compensate for some of the negatives; if not, that is one more reason not to like him.",
        "Donald Trump straddles entertainment and politics, a act that would seem to make him an ideal guest for a interview on CBS\u2019s \u201cLate Show\u201d with dynamic host Stephen Colbert. So he fired it up. At the top of his show last night, Colbert carted out a special \u201cTrump Phone\u201d complete with a tuft of hair on top of the blower. \u201cLet\u2019s get to the first question of any phone call. What are you wearing, Donald?\u201d asked Colbert as Trump listened from South Carolina.",
        "Johnny Hockin was unsure how he felt about Apple chief executive Tim Cook\u2019s very public rebuke Wednesday of the federal government\u2019s demand for help unlocking an iPhone left behind by an assailant in the San Bernardino terrorist attack. Hockin, 32, owns an iPhone. But he\u2019s not a technologist or privacy advocate. He\u2019s a film producer living in Toronto. Yet his social media feeds burned up with strong reactions to Cook\u2019s letter. Many people applauded Apple\u2019s defiant stance. The Twitter hashtag \u201cStandWithApple\u201d took off.",
        "When leaders at Prince George\u2019s County Public Schools announced last week that a volunteer at Judge Sylvania W. Woods Elementary School had allegedly made videos of more than a dozen children performing sex acts, the system\u2019s chief executive put the school\u2019s principal on paid leave. When Los Angeles school officials found out four years ago that a teacher had abused dozens of children, including feeding them semen in what he called a tasting game, the system\u2019s superintendent removed all 128 of the school\u2019s staffers \u2014 every one of the 88 teachers and 40 janitors, administrators and others.",
        "Nine months after the bodies of three family members and their housekeeper were found in a stately, upper Northwest Washington home that had been set on fire, federal prosecutors Wednesday indicted their sole suspect on 20 counts including murder, burglary and kidnapping. Daron Wint, 35, of Lanham, Md. was charged with multiple counts of murder in the slayings of businessman Savvas Savopoulos, 46, his wife, Amy, 47, their son, Philip, 10, and housekeeper Veralicia Figueroa, 57. Police discovered the bodies May 14 after firefighters were called to the home to investigate a fire.",
        "Last week, a prison riot in northern Mexico claimed the lives of 49 inmates. The violence that convulsed Topo Chico prison, in the city of Monterrey, involved clashes between members of rival factions of the notorious Zetas cartel. It was the worst such clash since 44 members of the Gulf cartel were killed in a similar 2014 battle, also in the state of Nuevo L\u00e9on. Authorities recovered some 60 hammers, 86 knives and 120 shivs used in the deadly fracas, which they believe was a turf war within the complex.",
        "While the rest of the world is focused on hunting down mosquitoes with Zika, a group of doctors and researchers in Argentina has published a report making the provocative argument that a pesticide, rather than the virus, is to blame for the alarming number of birth defects being reported in Brazil.",
        "It was the most of cases, one that seemed to cut straight to the core of America\u2019s struggles to confront sexual assault on college campuses. Jordan Johnson was the star quarterback for the University of Montana. He was tall and handsome and an NFL hopeful. He had nearly led the team to a national title. Then, suddenly, he was accused of rape. On March 19, 2012, a Missoula television station reported that a female student had filed a restraining order against Johnson after she accused him of raping her six weeks earlier. Life quickly unraveled for Johnson.",
        "In the 1950s, the Food and Drug Administration established an official definition for parmesan cheese. According to these requirements, it cannot contain more than 32 precent moisture, while it must have a \u201dgranular texture,\u201d come with a \u201dhard and brittle rind,\u201d grate \u201dreadily,\u201d and be made from cow\u2019s milk, among others things. Nowhere in the definition is there the suggestion that \u201dwood pulp\u201d would be an appropriate ingredient. Nor does it say it\u2019s acceptable to substitute in less expensive cheeses, such as cheddar, swiss, and mozzarella.",
        "Anthropologist Dan Grunspan was studying the habits of undergraduates when he noticed a persistent trend: Male students assumed their male classmates knew more about course material than female students \u2014 even if the young women earned better grades. \u201cThe pattern just screamed at me,\u201d he said. So, Grunspan and his colleagues at the University of Washington and elsewhere decided to quantify the degree of this gender bias in the classroom. After surveying roughly 1, 700 students across three biology courses, they found young men consistently gave each other more credit than they awarded to their female classmates.",
        "Carol Brown, Harper\u2019s Bazaar, ca. 1958. (\u00a9 Saul Leiter Courtesy Howard Greenberg Gallery, New York) Even after the plaudits started to rain down after the publication of his now essential book, \u201cEarly Color\u201d in 2006, Saul Leiter was a reluctant legend. Born into an Orthodox Jewish family in Pittsburgh in 1923, Leiter was expected to follow in the religious footsteps of his father, a rabbi. But he had other ideas and gravitated toward the arts. In 1946, he moved to New York to start a life as an artist, where he lived until his death in 2013.",
        "Men\u2019s Alpine Combined Slalom and Men\u2019s Gold Medal winner River Radamus (USA) celebrated his 18th birthday during the Winter Youth Olympic Games in Lillehammer, Norway. (Arnt Folvik for ) River Radamus, an from Colorado, entered four skiing events during the Winter Youth Olympic Games in Lillehammer, Norway this month. He has won three of them. If he wins the the Men\u2019s Slalom event on Thursday February it is seriously doubtful he will remain on the U. S. Ski Team\u2019s D Team, or unknown. These games are the brainchild of Jacques Rogge, a former president of the International Olympic Committee.",
        "KIAWAH ISLAND, S. C. \u2014 First was the British prime minister, who called Donald Trump \u201cdivisive, stupid and wrong. \u201d Then came Britain\u2019s Parliament, which denounced him with colorful language. The French prime minister, the Turkish president and a Saudi prince also weighed in: The Republican presidential they agreed, was a demagogue disgracing the United States. On Thursday, Pope Francis added the strongest voice yet to a growing chorus of world leaders taking a stand against the celebrity candidate \u2014 condemning Trump\u2019s immigration agenda and suggesting he was not a Christian because of it.",
        "In the anxious weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Florida House hurriedly assembled an elite group of lawmakers to develop plans to keep the state safe. A spot on the Select Committee on Security was a mark of prominence in Tallahassee. Some of the airplane hijackers had acquired Florida driver\u2019s licenses and trained at flight schools in the state, and legislators lobbied furiously behind the scenes in hopes of being named to the panel tasked with addressing the state\u2019s newly exposed vulnerabilities.",
        "It\u2019s been more than a decade since \u201cFriends\u201d went off the air, and Rachel, Ross, Monica, Chandler, Phoebe and Joey have all moved on. But us? Not so much. That\u2019s obvious from the rabid excitement swirling around Sunday\u2019s \u201cFriends\u201d reunion, which \u2014 to be clear \u2014 is definitely not a reunion. \u201cWe feel like the show did a really good job of telling their story, and when it was done, it was done,\u201d said David Crane in a phone interview.",
        "JERUSALEM \u201dFor centuries, the Damascus Gate has stood as the portal to the Old City of Jerusalem, opening onto a packed bazaar of souvenir shops, teahouses and falafel joints \u201d and the holiest places for Jews, Christians and Muslims.",
        "Charles G. Koch is chairman and chief executive of Koch Industries. As he campaigns for the Democratic nomination for president, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (I) often sounds like he\u2019s running as much against me as he is the other candidates. I have never met the senator, but I know from listening to him that we disagree on plenty when it comes to public policy. Even so, I see benefits in searching for common ground and greater civility during this overly negative campaign season.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: A new CBS News poll out this morning finds that Donald Trump continues to dominate among Republican voters nationally: He\u2019s backed by 35 percent; Ted Cruz has 18 percent; and has 12 percent. There was a great deal of excitement about yesterday\u2019s NBC poll finding Trump had slipped behind Cruz, but that now looks like it may have been an outlier. But never mind that for now.",
        "Hours after Justice Antonin Scalia died on Saturday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) said, \u201cThe American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President. \u201d Similar statements followed from other Republican senators. Democrats decried the delay as \u201cunprecedented,\u201d and political commentators wondered whether Republicans could indeed pull off delaying until next January. It\u2019s true that the GOP\u2019s historical case for an delay is shaky at best.",
        "THE BLACK PRESIDENCY: Barack Obama and the Politics of Race in America By Michael Eric Dyson Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. 346 pp. $27 In April of last year, Michael Eric Dyson wrote a lengthy and brutal takedown of his old friend and mentor, Cornel West, labeling the black philosopher a narcissistic, scholar overcome by petty resentments.

        "At the conclusion of Thursday night\u2019s town hall with Donald Trump on MSNBC, the featured guest made pains to assert that he\u2019d been through the wringer with \u201cMorning Joe\u201d duo Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy,\u201d said Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work. I mean, I\u2019m here. I could be someplace else, to be honest with you. Okay, I\u2019m being grilled by the two of you; I could be someplace else. \u201d \u201cGrilled,\u201d here, means a few signs of skepticism from the hosts plus several reasonably demanding questions."
