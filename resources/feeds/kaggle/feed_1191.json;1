Kennedy International Airport from Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic, but no one aboard could have imagined just how bad things would get.

        "The debate over the perils of salty diets may be one of the most polarized in all of science. On one side, scientists warn ominously that most Americans are killing themselves with salt. On the other, scientists insist most Americans are fine. The inability to resolve this question may seem puzzling. It is a question with deadly consequences, at least potentially. How much salt is healthy? Given the marvels of technology, it seems like that ought to be an easy one.",

To Edwards, who\u2019s a professional wingman, it\u2019s more fun than saying \u201ctell me about yourself\u201d and is enough to get a conversation going. But first: What\u2019s his story? What exactly is a professional wingman? He\u2019s not a pickup artist. Edwards doesn\u2019t teach his clients how to \u201cneg,\u201d or put people down while trying to pick them up.

        "One in a series of reports on the clothes that had a moment at New York Fashion Week. NEW YORK \u2014 There are undoubtedly many facets to Ralph Lauren, but on the runway we typically just see the classicist and the costumer. They tend not to exist in harmony. To open his Fall 2016 show, Lauren sent model Karlie Kloss down the runway in taupe cashmere and flannel. The roomy trousers with their high waist and pleats looked comfortable and elegant, and the soft cardigan could quickly become a favorite part of a woman\u2019s wardrobe.",

Staffers and volunteers hugged warmly, realizing that they had just one more day to convince Republicans to pick their guy.

Here\u2019s a simple piece of advice for anyone confused by the partisan politics of replacing Justice Antonin Scalia: Assume that anyone who claims to be acting out of a pristine sense of civic principle is being dishonest.

Through the early morning fog, I make out a temple nestled in a grove of palm trees. Soon I am passing over a traditional Buddhist structure with fine details and elaborate entrances.
