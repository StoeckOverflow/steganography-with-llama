        "On Feb. 1, 18 internationally recognized photography experts gathered in Amsterdam to choose the best photojournalism and documentary photographs produced in 2015. It was a monumental task; the judges ended up sifting through 82, 951 images submitted by photographers spread out among 128 countries. In the end, the jury awarded prizes for eight different categories, including the coveted World Press Photo of the year. That ultimate prize went to a photograph that hadn\u2019t even been published.",
        "COLUMBIA, S. C. \u2014 South Carolina\u2019s Republican primary often has had a truly clarifying effect on the party\u2019s presidential nomination race. Saturday\u2019s results appeared to fall short of fulfilling that role. At a minimum, the outcome here solidified New York businessman Donald Trump as the for the nomination, with his two leading rivals now Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who were in a dogfight for second place.",
        "Bernie Sanders, his momentum slowed by a loss to Hillary Clinton in Nevada, faces two tests in the weeks ahead: parceling out his formidable resources to the states that offer his best targets, and boosting turnout in what thus far has been a mediocre year for it. His path to the Democratic nomination, already steep, has narrowed considerably now that Clinton has herself as the frontrunner. To actually win the nomination, Sanders acknowledged Sunday that he will have to begin winning again, as he did when he trounced Clinton in New Hampshire.",

        "LONDON \u2014 Mayor Boris Johnson, one of the most charismatic figures in U. K. politics, threw his considerable influence behind the push for a British exit from the European Union on Sunday, instantly galvanizing the campaign and potentially tipping the country toward a vote to leave in a June referendum. The decision to defy Prime Minister David Cameron, a fellow Conservative, represents a personal gamble for the politician and a major coup for the \u201cleave\u201d camp, which has been riven by bickering factions and has lacked a broadly palatable advocate.",
        "Republicans, you have one last chance. Following his finish in South Carolina, former Florida governor Jeb Bush ended his campaign for the White House, diminishing the hope among Republicans seeking a tolerable alternative to Donald Trump. On a night in which Nevada Democrats helped the chances of their more pragmatic candidate, Hillary Clinton, the GOP found itself with just one option left in the race. And, no, it is not Sen. Marco Rubio ( .) whose narrow finish in South Carolina sets him up to be the choice among many Republican donors and establishment types. It is Ohio Gov.",
        "Danielle Allen is a political theorist at Harvard University and a contributing columnist for The Post. Like any number of us raised in the late 20th century, I have spent my life perplexed about exactly how Hitler could have come to power in Germany. Watching Donald Trump\u2019s rise, I now understand. Leave aside whether a direct comparison of Trump to Hitler is accurate. That is not my point. My point rather is about how a demagogic opportunist can exploit a divided country.",
        "Lyndon Johnson simply was exasperated. Barack Obama\u2019s mischief was methodical. Four days before the 1966 congressional elections, Johnson, asked about criticism from Richard Nixon, testily responded: \u201cI do not want to get into a debate . . . with a chronic campaigner like Mr. Nixon. \u201d Johnson\u2019s disparagement endeared Nixon to Republican voters, thereby propelling him toward the presidency.

        "The Clinton political dynasty is still alive. The Bush dynasty has been routed. Their contrasting fates, to this point at least, tell us much about our two parties, the nature of this year\u2019s presidential election, and the dueling legacies themselves. The Republican and Democratic contests are very different, beginning with the fact that Hillary Clinton did not have to deal with Donald Trump, who targeted Jeb Bush with a viciousness rarely seen in contemporary politics. For months, the former Florida governor responded ineffectually to an opponent who flouted all the norms.",
        "In this depressingly unserious campaign season, it\u2019s time \u2014 past time \u2014 to take Donald Trump seriously. In particular, to take seriously what passes for Trump\u2019s domestic policy, aside from that wall. Trump purports to care about the national debt. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep doing this,\u201d he said of the debt at MSNBC\u2019s town hall Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to start balancing budgets. \u201d Ruth Marcus is a columnist for The Post, specializing in American politics and domestic policy.",
        "TWELVE STATES that undertook investigations of Planned Parenthood found no wrongdoing. An additional eight states refused even to investigate, citing lack of credible evidence. A grand jury in Texas and a federal judge in California exonerated the organization after each conducted extensive reviews. Three congressional committees failed to turn up any improprieties. In short, the videos purporting to show illegal selling of fetal tissue show no such thing. Despite all that, a House panel is undeterred in conducting its own investigation, or, more accurately, witch hunt.",
        "AMMAN, Jordan \u2014 Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Sunday that he and his Russian counterpart had reached a \u201cprovisional agreement in principle\u201d for a temporary truce in the Syrian civil war and that it could start within days. Kerry said he spoke Sunday morning to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov for the second day in a row, adding that final details are be ironed out in a phone call between President Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

        "Update: A more complete video has emerged of the incident, with both sides appearing to be about it. See here for the latest. With primary season in full swing, political news has begun to settle into some expected patterns. The assumption is that most of the big surprises that remain will come from voters, delegate counts and perhaps some unforeseeable candidate scandal. To that end, there are plenty of stories that put Republican Donald Trump\u2019s supporters on record as raucous types who are not ashamed to use their fists, spit and do other things to their political opponents.",
        "In the closest finish in Daytona 500 history, Denny Hamlin edged Martin Truex Jr. winning the race by mere inches at the finish line. Truex had moved past Matt Kenseth but couldn\u2019t hold off a bold charge from Hamlin, who was fourth going into the final lap, at Daytona International Speedway and lost by 0. 011.

        "AUSTIN, Texas \u2014 When Texas\u2019 conservative Legislature passed a law requiring public universities to allow concealed guns on campus, it also gave the state\u2019s private institutions of higher learning the chance to follow suit. None has so far. More than 20 private schools have said they won\u2019t lift their gun bans when the law takes effect this August, including the state\u2019s largest private universities that have religious affiliations and often align with the type of conservative values espoused by the politicians behind the law.",

I can tell you exactly how long I can spend completely alone, with no contact with any other humans, before I feel lonely: 15 days. I know because I tried it.

        "LAS VEGAS \u2014 Mainstream Republican donors and elected officials flocked to Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) on Monday amid a growing sense that he is the last best chance to prevent Donald Trump from running away with the Republican presidential nomination. But Rubio\u2019s path remains narrow and perilous. He has yet to win a state, and a raft of major March 1 contests known as \u201cSuper Tuesday\u201d offers few obvious chances for him to do so. And if Trump keeps racking up wins, it will become more difficult to blunt his progress.",
        "LAS VEGAS Sen. Ted Cruz ( .) has parted ways with Rick Tyler, his longtime campaign spokesman, attempting to put an end to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s accusation that the Texan is trying to win the Republican presidential nomination with dirty tricks. \u201dYesterday, a staffer from our campaign sent out a tweet that tweeted a news story that purported to indicate Marco saying something negative about the Bible,\u201d Cruz said. \u201dThe news story was false.

        "When Bernie Sanders won New Hampshire by a wide margin, he was understandably excited. \u201cBecause of a huge voter turnout \u2014 and I say huge,\u201d he said afterward, drawing out the \u201cu\u201d sound in his distinctive Brooklyn accent, \u201cwe won. \u201d The turnout overall was not that huge, but Sanders still received more votes than any previous Democrat in the state by a wide margin.

        "Appearing on multiple Sunday shows, Donald Trump demonstrated how maddeningly incoherent and inconsistent he can be. Listening to him over and over again, however, one begins to suspect this is an act to avoid close scrutiny. When pressed, for example, on whether he wants an individual mandate, a position he took with Anderson Cooper at last week\u2019s town hall, he rambled thusly on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d: WALLACE: Mr. Trump, question: do you support the individual mandate on Obamacare or not?

        "As the Senate returns to work Monday for the first time since Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death, Senate Republicans have a major decision on their hands. Do they consider President Obama\u2019s nominee to fill Scalia\u2019s seat and risk upsetting their base? Do they try to block consideration of Obama\u2019s nominee for a whole year and risk upsetting a broader pool of voters? Or do they aim for something in the middle? It\u2019s a tough decision with potentially major consequences at the ballot box not to mention the future of the court itself."
