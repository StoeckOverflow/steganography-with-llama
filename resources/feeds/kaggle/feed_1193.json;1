        "Thirteen bald eagles were found dead over the weekend near a farm on Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore in what authorities say is the largest single of bald eagles in the state in 30 years. Officials with the Maryland Natural Resources Police said they received a call around 2:30 p. m. Saturday from a man who said he was out looking for antlers that deer might have shed and came across what he initially thought was a dead turkey in a field on a farm in Caroline County. He discovered it was four dead bald eagles.",
        "As she picked cotton and shucked corn in the fields of South Carolina with her parents, it never occurred to the young Virginia McLaurin that she might one day eat in the same restaurants as white people. And the notion that she would live to see the country elect a black president, and that one day she\u2019d be invited to the White House and clasp his hands and dance with him for all the world to see? Well, McLaurin could not have imagined that even deep into her old age.",
        "The American Dream that anyone can achieve success through hard work, grit and determination has always had a complicated relationship with the American Reality. Children born at the bottom of the income distribution are more likely than not to stay there. If you\u2019re a person of color or your parents aren\u2019t married, your odds of rising up are even worse. Policymakers on the left and right often tout education as the bridge to help poor kids make their way up the income ladder people with more education make more money.",

        "There are no lawyers or courtrooms in John Grisham\u2019s new thriller. There is not even a single bad guy.

One day his wife hears a loud thump in the bathroom. \u201cShe finds him on the floor,\u201d Grisham writes, \u201cshaking in a grand mal seizure. \u201d And so begins \u201cThe Tumor,\u201d one of the stranger literary digressions in recent memory.",
        "LAS VEGAS \u2014 The top three Republican presidential candidates made a late and vigorous push for support across Nevada as voters headed to caucus locations Tuesday evening in a contest expected to be dominated by Donald Trump. The billionaire mogul has led every recent public poll by double digits. Enormous crowds pack his rallies, including one Monday night in Las Vegas that drew an estimated 8, 000 people. Trump\u2019s nationalist call to deport illegal immigrants and wall them off has resonated with Nevada\u2019s whites resentful of the booming Latino population. But a Trump win is no done deal.",
        "Presidential politics is, at its core, all about math. Nowhere is that more true than in the fight for delegates to this summer\u2019s Republican National Convention. And, the delegate math is close to conclusive: Donald Trump will be extremely close to the 1, 237 delegates he needs to formally claim the party\u2019s nomination by the end of the primary process. Let\u2019s do the math \u2014 or, rather, let\u2019s do the math forwarded to me by a Republican who counts himself as a member of the Republican establishment but who also regards Trump\u2019s nomination as nearly inevitable.",

In late January, when Sanders brought his presidential campaign to Duluth, Schultz, a Democratic state representative, wrote a quick Facebook post welcoming him to northern Minnesota. Welcoming, not endorsing. Just being nice. That wasn\u2019t how her constituents read it. \u201cIt was shared, like, 8, 000 times,\u201d Schultz said.",

Aides and allies of the insurgent senator from Texas acknowledged in interviews this week that the campaign has been damaged by attacks on Cruz\u2019s integrity from Donald Trump and Marco Rubio.",
        "A federal judge ruled Tuesday that top aides to Democratic presidential Hillary Clinton should be questioned under oath about her use of a private email server as secretary of state, raising new political and legal complications for Clinton as she tries to maintain momentum for her campaign. The ruling granted a request from the conservative group Judicial Watch, which sought testimony from State Department officials and members of Clinton s inner circle to determine whether Clinton s email arrangement thwarted federal laws.",
        "ON SUNDAY, ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos asked Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus whether the party would back Donald Trump should he win the GOP nomination. \u201cYes, we will support the nominee,\u201d the Republican chairman replied. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s a . \u201d Mr. Stephanopoulos asked if a Trump nomination would split the party. \u201cWinning is the antidote to a lot of things,\u201d Mr. Priebus responded.

        "Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s ( .) decision to ask for the resignation of his communications director Rick Tyler, forced to apologize about passing on a false story and video claiming Sen. Marco Rubio ( .) had derided the Bible, is the latest calamity to befall the cocky Texan. It did not come at a good time, to put it mildly. The incident was another rotten news day for Cruz following a disappointing South Carolina showing. Just a day before the Nevada caucuses, the story will be one of the last things voters hear about before tomorrow.",
        "Ted Cruz fired his communications director, Rick Tyler, for smearing rival Marco Rubio with the false allegation that Rubio had disparaged the Bible. And Tyler\u2019s transgression is indeed inexcusable: He forgot that his boss prefers to do the smearing himself.

        "Ben Carson and Cornel West are polar opposites, ideologically, politically, socially. But they are kindred spirits when it comes to their disdain for President Obama. For these guardians of blackness, the first African American occupant of the Oval Office is not black enough. Better not tell Virginia McLaurin, the who was so excited to meet \u201ca black president\u201d that she danced her way into our hearts. Carson\u2019s presidential campaign is so anemic that a tear dropping into the ocean causes more waves.

        "It\u2019s perfectly plausible \u2014 though far from certain \u2014 that by after the voting in another two dozen states or so, Hillary Clinton will have accumulated an advantage over Bernie Sanders in delegates that is all but insurmountable. But even if that does happen, the Democratic contest probably won\u2019t end there. Because it may be in Sanders\u2019s interests to take this all the way to the Democratic convention this summer. And it\u2019s likely that he\u2019ll have the means to do so, as well.",

        "Senate Republicans on Tuesday united behind an official position on how to deal with President Obama\u2019s expected nominee to replace the late Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia: no hearings, no votes and no new justice until Obama is out of office. \u201cPresidents have a right to nominate, just as the Senate has its constitutional right to provide or withhold consent,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) said in a morning floor speech. \u201cIn this case, the Senate will withhold it. \u201d That declaration was underscored after McConnell held a meeting with Republicans sitting on the Senate Judiciary Committee.",

        "Few things are as painless to prepare as cereal. Making it requires little more than pouring something (a cereal of your choice) into a bowl and then pouring something else (a milk of your choice) into the same bowl. Eating it requires little more than a spoon and your mouth. The food, which Americans still buy $10 billion of annually, has thrived over the decades, at least in part, because of this very quality: Its convenience. And yet, for today\u2019s youth, cereal isn\u2019t easy enough.",
        "What is it that makes us connect to a person in a photograph whom we have never met? What makes portraits so effective at encouraging empathy? The answers to these questions may be more visceral than verbal. Dorothy Moss, associate curator of painting and sculpture at the National Portrait Gallery and director of the triennial Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition, defines a portrait as \u201ca direct encounter with an individual. \u201d The competition transcends mediums; paintings are compared to videos, sculpture, fiber art.

He had driven 70 miles to see Ohio Gov. John Kasich speak at a campaign event. He had raised his hand to ask a question. But when the audience turned toward him, the TV cameras aimed at him, and Kasich moved in closer to listen, Smith had found himself saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get emotional, but \u2014 \u201d and then he had gotten emotional.",
