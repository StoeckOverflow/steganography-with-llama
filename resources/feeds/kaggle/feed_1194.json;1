        "THE UNTHINKABLE is starting to look like the inevitable: Absent an extraordinary effort from people who understand the menace he represents, Donald Trump is likely to be the presidential nominee of the Republican Party. At this stage, even an extraordinary effort might fall short. But history will not look kindly on GOP leaders who fail to do everything in their power to prevent a bullying demagogue from becoming their . A few days ago we criticized Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus for his assertion that a Trump victory in November would silence the doubters.",
        "Mike DeBonis and Juliet Eilperin scoop: Brian Sandoval, the centrist Republican governor of Nevada, is being vetted by the White House for a possible nomination to the Supreme Court, according to two people familiar with the process \u2026 . Some Democrats believe that nominating Sandoval could fracture the front of Republican opposition and force [Mitch] McConnell to take up the nomination in this contentious election year. It would also put on the spot a handful of Senate Republicans who are up for reelection in blue states in November. But nominating Sandoval would carry risks for Obama.",
        "Donald Trump may not wind up as the Republican nominee for president, but at this point it\u2019s far and away the most likely outcome of the primary race. Having won three of the four contests so far, he\u2019s heading into Super Tuesday six days from now in a position to widen his lead beyond the point where his opponents could catch him. Which raises an inevitable question: Is he really as terrible a general election candidate as so many people have assumed? The most rational answer is that we have no idea.",
        "Sen. Ted Cruz ( .) has a bigger problem than coming in third in two consecutive conservative states in which he was planning on doing very well. He is losing his base, a fact Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s ( .) team is eager to point out. FiveThirtyEight explains: Tuesday night\u2019s results were very bad news for Cruz. It\u2019s not just that it was his third finish in a row. It\u2019s also how Cruz lost. He carried only 27 percent of the white and evangelical Christian vote, behind Trump\u2019s 41 percent.",
        "U. S. Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia was known for the exacting style of his opinions, the way he labored over each and every word. His hotel room the night of his death on Feb. 13 in Texas reflected this obsession with detail. According to a sheriff\u2019s report obtained by The Washington Post this week, he was lying in bed with his arms at his side and his bed covers smooth. Nearby was his suitcase, which was open and full of neatly folded clothes. Only one thing appeared amiss: a breathing apparatus.",
        "KALAMAZOO, Mich. \u201d Investigators say they are baffled. Neighbors are totally bewildered. All around this traumatized city, residents wonder whether they will ever learn why Jason Brian Dalton allegedly gunned down random strangers while picking up fares for Uber. This week, as police continued looking for clues into Saturday s shootings, so did people close to him. One neighbor was puzzled to learn Dalton, 45, was driving for Uber and not working for Progressive Insurance anymore.

The retired bakery worker thought she would live out her days in her ornately furnished cottage, where\u2019s she\u2019s amassed a lifetime\u2019s worth of memories. But earlier this month, the who is battling cancer, received an eviction notice, her friends say. Her landlord gave Hatch 60 days to vacate the home or be thrown out by sheriff\u2019s deputies.

        "For many people, the biggest hurdle to saving is creating the habit. While many financial advisers often recommend that clients take the work out of the process by having savings automatically deducted from each paycheck, plenty of people still struggle to get started. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing progress on the savings front,\u201d said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate. com, which found in a survey that 22 percent of consumers have more debt than emergency savings. \u201cAnd it\u2019s desperately needed. \u201d Without savings, he adds, some consumers may pile on more debt when emergencies happen.",
