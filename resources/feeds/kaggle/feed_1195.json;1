        "FORT WORTH, Tex. \u2014 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Friday received the endorsement of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) a stunning blow to the four remaining GOP White House hopefuls who are urgently working to obstruct the billionaire\u2019s path to the nomination. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to know all the people on that stage, and there is no one who is better prepared to provide America with the strong leadership that it needs, both at home and around the world, than Donald Trump,\u201d Christie said during a news conference with Trump here in Fort Worth.",
        "New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie endorsed Donald Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy on Friday in Texas, a stunning development sure to add to the growing sense of inevitability around Trump\u2019s bid for the Republican nomination. The only question anyone was asking in the wake of the endorsement was \u201dwhy\u201d? Or, more accurately, \u201dWHY? ?!?\u201d After all, Christie had savaged Trump as unelectable just a few weeks ago. So, why the abrupt ? I have four ideas that I think make sense. 1. Christie is a political realist.",

It is also about transforming Congress \u2014 which, in the past, has been happy to ignore Sanders\u2019s proposals for universal health insurance and free college tuition. But, in campaigns for the House and Senate, the revolution is not going well.",
        "RICHLANDS, Va. \u2014 Debi Thomas, the best African American figure skater in the history of the sport, couldn\u2019t find her figure skates. She looked around the darkened trailer, perched along a river in a town so broke even the bars have closed, and sighed. The mobile home where she lives with her fiance and his two young boys was cluttered with dishes, stacks of documents, a Christmas tree still standing weeks past the holiday. \u201cThey\u2019re around here somewhere,\u201d she murmured three times. \u201cI know I have a pair,\u201d she continued, before trailing off.",
        "For Donald Trump, it always comes back to winning \u2014 and greatness. So his response to Marco Rubio scoring some hits in last night\u2019s debate was to immediately seize control of the news cycle by appearing with Chris Christie at an extraordinary news conference, at which Christie endorsed Trump and absolutely torched Rubio as a lightweight fop whose new \u201cact\u201d is to \u201cbe entertaining and smile a lot.",
        "I have probably interviewed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie more times for more hours than any journalist outside New Jersey. I\u2019ve known him since he started running for governor in 2008. You can understand my shock then when a man who claimed to be serious about public service, who ran on concrete policies and a serious national security platform and who seemed genuinely concerned about an unqualified person becoming president would embrace a buffoon like Donald Trump.",
        "In his remarks today at a rally in Fort Worth, Tex. Donald Trump knew he\u2019d make news. \u201cI\u2019ve never said this before,\u201d he declared. We\u2019ll await the word of the Washington Post Fact Checker on the integrity of the statement, but Trump did appear to be veering into a new talking point.",
        "As the father of three daughters, I reserved the right to interview their dates. Seemed only fair to me. After all, my wife and I\u2019d spent 16 or 17 years feeding them, dressing them, funding braces and driving them to volleyball tournaments and piano recitals. A with the guy was a fair expectation. For the next few hours, she would be affected by his ability to drive a car, avoid the bad crowds and stay sober. I wanted to know if he could do it. I wanted to know if he was decent. This was my word: \u201cdecent.",
        "Donald Trump is now favored to win the GOP nomination for president, and it\u2019s not close. All the polling suggests that Trump will win almost every Super Tuesday state this coming week. Prediction markets have also swung behind the billionaire. Trump skeptics remain, and given his polarizing effect on Republicans, some skepticism is probably warranted. But the idea that a winnowing field will help a alternative surge to victory seems less plausible by the day. If Washington has a comparative advantage in anything, it is in postmortems.",

Obama, seeking to cement his legacy and rally popular support, held up the plant as a model of how the economic stimulus legislation he fought for seven years ago helped pull the economy back from an abyss. He credited stimulus money with encouraging the construction of the Jacksonville plant, creating jobs and contributing to American leadership in clean energy technology.",

In South Carolina itself, Clinton sent surrogates including Rep. James E. Clyburn ( . C.) \u2014 the black Democrat in the House \u2014 to polling places to make one last pitch.

        "KENNESAW, Ga. \u2014 In the sprint to Super Tuesday, Marco Rubio is scrambling to parlay his newfound aggression against Donald Trump into enough support at the polls not to be overwhelmed by the suffocating effects of the celebrity mogul\u2019s insurgent campaign. The result is that, rather than aiming to triumph on the biggest day of the Republican presidential nominating calendar, the candidate seen as the party establishment\u2019s best and perhaps only chance of defeating Trump merely hopes to hang on.",
