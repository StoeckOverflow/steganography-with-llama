        "HESSTON, Kan. \u2014 Locals are used to hearing the Excel Industries plant hum. It sits on the town\u2019s main road. School buses pass it. The unit grumbles, and when tools fire off, the sound ricochets across the plains. On Thursday, shots rang out on the factory floor. Workers ran clear across this town and jumped over fences and hollered for help. Hesston Police Chief Doug Schroeder entered the plant without backup and shot the gunman, employee Cedric Larry Ford. Four people lay dead, including Ford. An additional 14 were wounded.",
        "GAZIANTEP, Turkey \u2014 The unthinkable happened in Syria on Saturday as an internationally mandated truce unexpectedly took hold across much of the country, raising hopes that the beginning of an end to the crisis may be in sight. There were scattered skirmishes and bursts of artillery fire across some of the front lines, a car bomb killed two people in the province of Hama, and Syrian government warplanes dropped barrel bombs on a village in Idlib province, without causing casualties.",
        "After 20 years, Bernie Sanders wants to put welfare back on the national agenda, seeing a chance to use his message of economic equality to undermine Hillary Clinton\u2019s base of support among black voters. Primaries across the South over the next few days give him what might be the best chance he\u2019ll get. Hundreds of thousands of Southern families are living on less than $2 in cash a day as a result of legislation President Bill Clinton signed in 1996, according to new research by Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Kathryn Edin and University of Michigan\u2019s Luke Shaefer.",

In his annual letter to shareholders, published on Saturday, Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett made a forceful argument that Americans should look to the future with optimism, despite the dour messages broadcast from the presidential campaign trail. \u201cFor 240 years it\u2019s been a terrible mistake to bet against America, and now is no time to start,\u201d he said in the letter. \u201cAmerica\u2019s golden goose of commerce and innovation will continue to lay more and larger eggs.",
        "People who enter the teaching profession are generally those who want to help and make a difference in the lives of young people. Kids who present problems of one kind or another are often seen as welcome challenges to teachers \u2014 except when they prove highly disruptive to everyone else in the class. What are teachers supposed to do with those students who they would rather not be placed in their class \u2014 but are anyway. Here is one teacher\u2019s candid observations about her own experience.",
        "I am the worst date. I will scrutinize, analyze and dissect you, in order to find any and every flaw, regardless of how insignificant. I guarantee that, by the end of the night, your minor imperfections will have turned into significant for me. If you\u2019re a fantastic catch, well, that\u2019s when I do my best work: I dig extra hard and search for something \u2014 anything \u2014 that, ultimately, will convince me you\u2019re just not the right one for me. And once I find something, I can exhale and say, \u201cPhew, disaster (relationship) averted.",

Now that their children are teens, they need space for reading, socializing and relaxing. The Marshalls are looking for a \u201clibrary\u201d feel.

        "As it\u2019s become more and more clear that Donald Trump is the favorite to be the Republican presidential nominee, there\u2019s been considerable speculation about what he could mean for the broader GOP, particularly as the party tries to hold its Senate majority and consolidate its House margins in the 2016 election. The answer: Nothing good \u2014 and perhaps something very bad.",

        "The Army staff sergeant charged with killing one Prince William County police officer and injuring two others on Saturday opened fire as they arrived at his front door to investigate a domestic altercation, the Prince William County police chief said Sunday.

        "The other day, I saw a new patient in my office. She was 39 years old, healthy, a successful career woman, pregnant for the first time \u2014 and scared to death. After trying for two years to conceive, she had finally done it. But instead of being thrilled, she was worried about the potential complications that come with being pregnant as an older mom. After I answered all of her questions, the tension in the room dissipated, and she began to smile. I understood her worry. I could sense her excitement and her guilt over having waited so long.",

        "Hillary Clinton felt misunderstood. It was late 1994, Republican revolutionaries had stormed the House, and the first lady worried that it was her fault. Had she pushed too hard on reform? Did voters resent her influence in her husband\u2019s administration? During a meeting with confidantes in the White House residence, Clinton held back tears and contemplated stepping back from a visible role in politics and policy. Instead, she decided to reintroduce herself to America.",
        "Former CIA director Michael Hayden believes there is a legitimate possibility that the U. S. military would refuse to follow orders given by Donald Trump if the Republican becomes president and decides to make good on certain campaign pledges. Hayden, who also headed the National Security Agency from 1999 to 2005, made the provocative statement on Friday during an appearance on HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher. \u201d Trump, fresh off a string of primary victories, has yet to secure his party\u2019s nomination, but Hayden said the candidate\u2019s rhetoric already raises troubling questions.",
        "BENTONVILLE, Ark. \u2014 As a few thousand people waited for Donald Trump to arrive for a campaign rally in an airplane hangar in northwest Arkansas on Saturday afternoon, the theme song from the 1997 movie \u201cAir Force One\u201d began to play. In the cloudless blue sky, the billionaire businessman\u2019s jet appeared. It swooped past the hangar and disappeared as hundreds of phones recorded the spectacle. \u201cOh, my God, there it is \u2014 wow!\u201d a woman said, as she recorded a video she would later post on Facebook.",
        "In the darkness of a building in Afghanistan, Navy Senior Chief Edward C. Byers Jr. had little time to react: A fellow Navy SEAL had just been shot in the head during a hostage rescue mission, and it wasn\u2019t clear who else in the room wanted to kill the American team. Byers burst in anyway, shooting a Taliban fighter who had an automatic rifle aimed at him.",

        "GAZIANTEP, Turkey \u2014 Syria\u2019s truce began to fray Sunday, with Russian warplanes resuming airstrikes on towns and villages in the north and fresh reports of artillery fire across several front lines. The violence came on only the second day of a planned cessation of hostilities, dimming hopes that the calm that took hold Saturday will endure long enough to inject new impetus into a wider peace effort. The Russian planes, based in northwestern Syria, struck six towns and villages in the provinces of Aleppo, Hama and Idlib early Sunday, according to monitoring and civil defense groups.",

        "As some economists and Wall Street traders began to sense danger ahead of the crippling housing market collapse of 2008, Donald Trump waved away the worries and offered a concrete expression of confidence in the industry. In the spring of 2006, the tycoon hosted a glitzy event at Trump Tower to introduce Trump Mortgage LLC, a new firm that specialized in selling residential and commercial real estate loans. He devoted a floor of the Trump Organization headquarters at 40 Wall Street to the new business.",
        "There\u2019s talk of bad spray tans, sweat and urination. Accusations that a rival has ties to the mob. They\u2019ve called one another \u201clittle\u201d or \u201ca con artist. \u201d And they all agree that the other guys are liars. In the to Super Tuesday, Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Sens.

        "Justice Clarence Thomas on Monday broke his streak of not asking questions during oral arguments, one of the public\u2019s most enduring curiosities about the Supreme Court. Thomas\u2019s extensive questioning of a government lawyer in a relatively case stunned the courtroom and came just two weeks after the death of his closest ally on the court, Justice Antonin Scalia.",
        "It seemed we were talking about diversity about every five minutes at the Oscars. Chris Rock opened his monologue by saying he\u2019d never be the host if he had to be nominated for the job. We all got the joke \u2014 Chris Rock is black, and for the second year in the row, not a single actor nominated for an Oscar was black. But they also weren\u2019t Asian or Latino. Representation is a problem in Hollywood for all minorities, but all night long, the show\u2019s jokes focused almost entirely on the problem as it pertains to black people.",
        "Some cynics on the right and certainly the latest conventional wisdom in the mainstream media hold that Republicans will line up dutifully behind Donald Trump, should he be the nominee. Even before Trump\u2019s stunning refusal on Sunday to denounce the Ku Klux Klan and David Duke, evidence suggested there is more likely to be a split, which will leave us with an Old Republican Party and, in one form or another, a New Republican Party. The former will be the party of nativists and opportunists.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: If Republicans are going to have any hope of stopping the runaway train otherwise known as Donald Trump, it may rest on their ability to limit the breadth of his appeal. A single alternative to Trump \u2014 most likely Marco Rubio \u2014 could conceivably coalesce enough support among well educated, relatively affluent, more moderate Republicans or more mainstream conservatives and go on to triumph in March 15th states like Ohio and Florida, forcing a delegate showdown at the convention for the nomination. Super Tuesday looms as a big test of this proposition.",
        "Here, is how your party\u2019s likely nominee, Donald Trump, spends his Sunday morning. At 6:13 a. m. he retweets a quote by the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini: \u201cIt is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep. \u201d When confronted later with its provenance, Trump says: \u201cWhat difference does it make if it was Mussolini or somebody else?
