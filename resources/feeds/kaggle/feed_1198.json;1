        "Super Tuesday victories by Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton put the nation on a path toward an ugly and contentious general election, pitting a pair of presidential candidates saddled with vulnerabilities in a contest that will be decided by a fearful and angry electorate divided along racial, cultural and ideological lines. A general election matchup would represent the continuation of a decade or more of politics marked by gridlock in Washington, distrust of institutions and leaders, and political discourse that has been on a downward spiral.",
        "Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who briefly led the Republican presidential race before his campaign began an extended public implosion, told his supporters in a statement Wednesday afternoon that he does not see a \u201cpath forward\u201d and will not attend Thursday\u2019s debate in Detroit. But Carson did not formally suspend his campaign. Instead, he said in the statement that he has decided to make a speech about his political future on Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland, just outside Washington.",
        "BURLINGTON, Vt. \u2014 Top strategists for presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders sought to make the case Wednesday that the senator from Vermont still has a path to the Democratic nomination that involves winning in industrial Midwestern states and other targets such as New York and California. Not so fast, said the campaign manager for Hillary Clinton, who won seven of 11 states with primaries and caucuses on Super Tuesday and considerably widened her lead over Sanders in the delegate count for the nomination. She also won in the territory of American Samoa.",
        "Sooooo. The Fix and it seems much of Twitter could not help but notice that Chris Christie showed up in Florida at Donald Trump\u2019s faux Versailles er, we mean and had some difficulties. Technically, he was there to introduce a victorious Trump. Trump was prepared to talk about his big Super Tuesday wins for a long time. Christie was less prepared to be standing behind Trump the entire time. New Jersey Gov.",
        "The Supreme Court\u2019s liberal justices seemed convinced in Wednesday\u2019s arguments that Texas\u2019 abortion regulations were an unconstitutional burden on a woman\u2019s right to an abortion, but the justice who holds the key vote questioned whether there was enough evidence to make such a finding. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, whom both sides consider pivotal to the outcome of the court\u2019s most important abortion case in a generation, wondered whether it was possible to tell whether it is the 2013 changes in the Texas law that forced the closure of nearly half the state\u2019s abortion clinics.",
        "Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the Supreme Court s most ardent protector of abortion rights, outspoken enough about their importance to become an icon to young feminists and a source of outrage among her detractors. With her valedictory on the court undetermined but within sight, Ginsburg, 82, may have only one more chance to leave a mark on reproductive rights.",
        "The first one arrived at 11 a. m. \u2014 on Monday. An older woman, armed with a lawn chair, an umbrella, a vast blue tarp and strong opinions, set up camp just to the right of the Supreme Court\u2019s marble steps. And she waited. hours to go. Thirty six. Twenty four. Twelve. Ten. By midnight Wednesday, a crowd of about 40 people sat in line behind her, huddling under blankets and trash bags against the drizzle that turned into a cold rain before the the sun finally came out and the doors opened for the 10 a. m. event.",

        "The Republican Party is on the verge of being taken over by an egomaniac who appeals to the nation\u2019s darkest impulses. Yet Donald Trump\u2019s foes are splintered, tactically but also philosophically. It doesn\u2019t help that each of his three serious challengers is a flawed alternative. None is sufficiently dominant to force the others aside. E. J. Dionne writes about politics in a column and on the PostPartisan blog.",
        "I write today to confess error. A few months back, pondering the ghastly parlor game of choosing between President Donald Trump and President Ted Cruz, I opted \u2014 reluctantly, disbelievingly \u2014 for Trump, as the lesser of two dangers. Ruth Marcus is a columnist for The Post, specializing in American politics and domestic policy. View Archive Facebook RSS Yes, the real estate tycoon is a buffoon. Also: a demagogue and a bully whose emotional instability would pose a threat to national security. But the Cruz alternative, it seemed to me then, was even worse.",
        "As the Donald Trump campaign rolls on, the secret to his success is becoming clear: his promise to make America more like Denmark. Say what? The Donald rarely if ever mentions the land of Lego, though Ted Cruz did once accuse him of being crazy enough to bomb it. Denmark is Bernie Sanders\u2019s utopia \u2014 a Scandinavian social democracy with free health care and college, whose enlightened rulers have \u201cgone a long way to ending the enormous anxieties that come with economic insecurity,\u201d as Sanders once put it.",

Dear Jeb Bush, I\u2019ve read that you are resting, getting some exercise and writing notes. I can understand that. But you are a public servant, and there is an epic battle raging for your country\u2019s soul. This is just to say you remind me of Achilles. Forgive me. I\u2019m a classicist. Those ancient myths haunt my memory. In the Trojan War, Achilles was the greatest fighter. But he got in a tangle with boastful, authoritarian, loutish Agamemnon, who stole his battle prize.",
        "EVEN AS Donald Trump attempted to tone himself down Tuesday night, he could not help underlining why he is such a menace. \u201cI\u2019m going to get along with [House Speaker Paul D.

SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, delivered a sweeping indictment of Donald Trump on Thursday and implored Republicans to reject the businessman\u2019s candidacy in an election \u201dthat will have profound consequences for the Republican Party and, more importantly, for the country.\u201d \u201dDonald Trump is a phony, a fraud,\u201d Romney told nearly 700 people at the University of Utah. \u201dHis promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University.",
        "Mitt Romney savaged Donald Trump as deeply dishonest and fundamentally unelectable in a speech in Utah today, an attempt by the 2012 Republican presidential nominee to force a reexamination of the real estate billionaire before he gets any closer to locking up the GOP nomination. \u201dHere\u2019s what I know,\u201d Romney said. \u201dDonald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University.",
        "He calls it a phenomenon, a movement \u2014 an awakening. For months, Donald Trump has claimed that his support is much deeper than it appears, deep enough to win the Republican nomination and perhaps also the presidency. So far, he has been proven right. Exit polls from primaries over the past month show his supporters as a mix of men and women who are mostly white but not exclusively. Their salaries, education levels, religious beliefs and degree of conservatism run the gamut. Their top worries are terrorism, national security, the economy and the ballooning national debt.",
        "If Donald Trump could have asked for one person to attack him, the person whose criticism would reinforce all the arguments Trump makes for his own campaign, he could hardly have done better than Mitt Romney. Romney\u2019s speech today, no matter what the merits of its particulars, is a microcosm of the entire effort now underway by party insiders to find some way to get rid of Trump. Too little, too late, and offered by precisely the wrong people, it will probably produce the exact opposite of its intended effect.",

        "This was what we have been waiting for this entire election cycle. A rousing speech from Mitt Romney. People tuned in, at 11:30 a. m. on their Thursdays to watch Mitt Romney address the Hinckley Institute of Politics and when they looked up from the speech, they were pale and horrified and their mouths hung open in shock. \u201cMy God,\u201d they said. \u201cThe spell is broken. Donald Trump is just a huckster. \u201d \u201cDid you hear what Mitt said?\u201d one person asked. \u201cDonald Trump is playing us for fools!",
        "I never thought I would write this: I am glad Mitt Romney is back on the public stage. Finally, a senior Republican is really prosecuting the case against Donald Trump, arguing aggressively and with substance that the billionaire is a not just an offensive bully \u2014 but an incompetent and a unique threat to the country\u2019s core democratic values. I hope Romney helps galvanize the GOP\u2019s movement.",
