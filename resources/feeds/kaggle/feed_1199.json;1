The South Dakotan was just one of a surging number of Americans to fall victim to a scam in which fraudsters try to steal other people\u2019s tax refunds by filing phony, inflated returns on their behalf. But this year was supposed to be different: In January, the IRS mailed Wittrock \u2014 along with 2.",

        "Sadness can weigh on you quite dearly, and sometimes a particularly sad or stressful event can trigger what\u2019s known as \u201dbroken heart syndrome.\u201d Under this condition, also known as Takotsubo syndrome or stress cardiomyopathy, the heart muscles rapidly and severely weaken. This temporary ailment causes severe chest pain and can lead to consequences such as heart attack and even death. But it\u2019s not just the terrible times that can cause this syndrome; joyful and happy occasions also can trigger broken heart syndrome, according to a study published Thursday in European Heart Journal.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 The SAT\u2019s infamous guessing penalty is gone. Its vocabulary is less arcane, minus words like \u201clachrymose\u201d and \u201cobsequious\u201d that students tended to memorize and then forget. Its essay is now optional. The perfect score \u2014 set in 2005 at 2400 \u2014 is reverting to the iconic standard from generations past: 1600. But perhaps the most important change to the retooled college admission test that debuts this week for hundreds of thousands of students nationwide lies in its approach to what they learn in high school.",
        "TEL AVIV \u2014 A joint exercise now being conducted between thousands of Israeli troops and the U. S. European Command represents a final test before Israel begins to deploy one of the most sophisticated missile defense systems in the world. When it is complete, Israel\u2019s rocket and missile air defense system will be far superior to anything in the Middle East and will likely rival, and in some ways surpass, in speed and targeting, air defenses deployed by Europe and the United States, its developers say. The United States has provided more than $3.",
        "If you were to pick up a spotted \u2019s feather, you might think it doesn\u2019t look like anything special. It has an uneven, color and white patches. The leading edge is a row of stunted barbs; on the other side the delicate tendrils wisp away. But this unassuming tattered edge makes for one of the most fascinating feathers in the world. Although the design creates drag, it can also muffle the sound of the bird\u2019s approach to prey before it swiftly folds its talons around an unsuspecting mouse or insect.",
        "Only a year ago, Republicans were congratulating themselves on having the strongest field of presidential candidates in a generation \u2014 diverse, highly credentialed conservatives who might be the salvation of a party that had lost the popular vote in five of the past six elections. But now, the question is how close the Grand Old Party will come to annihilating itself and what it stands for.

        "It\u2019s highly questionable whether anyone emerged as the winner in Thursday\u2019s Republican presidential debate in Detroit, though the candidates\u2019 spinmeisters would all quibble with that. There was one clear loser: the Grand Old Party. The 11th debate of the Republican campaign tested the patience and the limits of viewers and voters. Insults and interruptions overwhelmed sober discussion. The raucous audience, now a staple of the GOP debates, only added to the sense of politics. Can anyone credibly suggest that the Republicans put their collective best face forward Thursday night?",
        "Round Two of Donald Trump vs. Megyn Kelly turned out to be not much of a fight. During the debate Thursday night, Kelly landed a series of blows that seemed to leave the GOP\u2019s reeling.

Sure, it\u2019s natural for a show to fizzle over time. But maybe it\u2019s also because last season, despite typically strong performances from Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright, the show featured unnecessarily complex storylines, deadly boring political shenanigans and questionable subplots that served no real purpose. Although when you think about it \u2026 the first season had similar issues. The second season did, too.",
        "BATON ROUGE, La. \u2014 Already, the state of Louisiana had gutted university spending and depleted its funds. It had cut 30, 000 employees and furloughed others. It had slashed the number of child services staffers, including those devoted to foster family recruitment, and young abuse victims for the first time were spending nights at government offices. And then, the state\u2019s new governor, John Bel Edwards (D) came on TV and said the worst was yet to come. Edwards, in a address on Feb.",
        "The trio of Megyn Kelly, Bret Baier and Chris Wallace handed their colleague Bill O\u2019Reilly a fine setup last night. In a wild showdown in Detroit, the moderators pressed the four remaining Republican candidates on the budget, and their records as leaders, among other stuff. To great effect, they deployed graphics to slow down the blustering Donald Trump over key factual issues, including his pledge to curb spending by targeting waste, fraud and abuse. So O\u2019Reilly had vast pastures in which to roam when he started his show.",

        "It is rare that a major political problem can be solved by the strategic application of a wooden ruler. This one can. The size of Donald Trump\u2019s hands has become (pauses typing to drink heavily) a major subject of political discussion. Marco Rubio has used it as a subject for attack. (\u201cYou know what they say about men with small hands. . . . You can\u2019t trust them. \u201d) John Oliver has made jokes about it.

        "Back in the 1950s, when the institutions were still new and shaky, I\u2019m sure many people feared the Western alliance might never take off. Perhaps in the 1970s, the era of the Red Brigades and Vietnam, many more feared that the West would not survive. But in my adult life, I cannot remember a moment as dramatic as this: Right now, we are two or three bad elections away from the end of NATO, the end of the European Union and maybe the end of the liberal world order as we know it.",

And for decades he did just that, eventually expanding the Longitudinal Study (MSLS) to observe other cardiovascular risk factors, including diabetes, obesity, and smoking.
