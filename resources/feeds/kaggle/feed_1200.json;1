        "This is shaping up to be a seminal year in American politics. What was unthinkable six months ago is emerging as a strong possibility today: Donald Trump may be on his way to becoming the Republican nominee for president of the United States.  His ascension is causing the party establishment  \u201d congressional leaders,   conservative commentators and     money moguls  \u201d to go, as Sen. Lindsey O. Graham ( . C.) put it:    crazy",
        "Christine Dinsmore is a writer and editor who lives in Woodstock, N. Y. The assistant district attorney pressed the police officer for details. Did he ask my grandmother Maria Consolazio whether she knew she was going to die? \u201cI did,\u201d Officer Arthur O\u2019Neill answered. \u201cShe said she didn\u2019t know. \u201d Reuben Wilson, the assistant D. A. further questioned: Had he asked her if she had any hope of recovery? O\u2019Neill did \u2014 she didn\u2019t know. This testimony in State of New York v. Regina Michele was heard in the New York City 6th District Court of Brooklyn on Nov.",
        "So it has come to this: a brokered convention or President Hillary Clinton. These options seem to be what\u2019s left to Republicans of conscience, who are, let\u2019s face it, rather to the pyre. They\u2019re based on the following evidence: It is highly unlikely that Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio or John Kasich can wrest the nomination from Donald Trump, even though most polls show each of the three beating Clinton but Clinton beating Trump. Kathleen Parker writes a column on politics and culture. She received the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary In 2010.",
        "WE SHARE widespread concern over the influence of money in politics. This is a far cry, however, from believing that the system has been permanently rigged by the \u201cbillionaire class. \u201d Ironically, this year\u2019s presidential campaign, fueled so powerfully by such accusations of total corruption, has done much to disprove the claim. We understand the distortion of policymaking that the symbiotic relationship between candidates and donors engenders.",
        "In Flint, Mich. \u201cour city\u2019s children were poisoned by toxic water because their governor wanted to save a little money. \u201d \u2014 Hillary Clinton, remarks on Super Tuesday, March 2, 2016 Hillary Clinton has devoted a lot of attention to the water crisis in Flint, but readers have wondered about her statement that the crisis was the direct result of Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder wanting \u201cto save a little money. \u201d The timeline is complex, but does Clinton\u2019s statement stand up to scrutiny?",
        "Donald Trump promises that if Americans send him to the White House, he\u2019ll bring back waterboarding \u2014 and techniques that are \u201ca hell of a lot worse. \u201d Why? Because \u201ctorture works,\u201d he claims, and even \u201cif it doesn\u2019t work, they deserve it anyway. \u201d That\u2019s not Trump\u2019s only bright idea for U. S. counterterrorism policy. He\u2019d also \u201cbomb the hell out of ISIS,\u201d and he favors targeting the spouses and children of Islamic State fighters, too, since \u201cwith the terrorists, you have to take out their families.",
        "At the federal level, the fight for gay rights is practically nonexistent. But at the state level, the cultural and legislative battle is raging. The latest salvo to be fired comes in California, where the Sacramento Bee\u2019s Jon Ortiz a lawmaker proposed a bill that would prohibit state employees from using government funds to travel to states that have laws that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocates say sanctions discrimination against them. It comes days after South Dakota\u2019s Republican governor vetoed a bill that would have restricted transgender students\u2019 access to public schools and locker rooms.",
        "CRYSTAL CITY, Tex. \u2014 Packs of dogs roam the streets in this small town about 120 miles outside of San Antonio, and dozens of vacant homes and businesses have their windows barred or boarded. The city council, which is supposed to run the government, has only one member not facing federal criminal charges, and the city manager, also charged, has been suspended. In recent weeks, the water from some residents\u2019 faucets gushed out black. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, this poor town,\u201d said Tomasa Salas, 55, as she waited in front of city hall to pick up plastic jugs of water.",
        "BAGHDAD \u2014 Some Iraqi officials refer to it as \u201cthe gap,\u201d and it is becoming as pressing a concern as the fight against the Islamic State. Each month, Iraq\u2019s government pays out nearly $4 billion in salaries and pensions to the military and a bloated array of workers. But with more than 90 percent of government revenue coming from oil, it is bringing in only about half that as crude prices plunge.",
        "As the Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday for the most consequential abortion case in a generation, new criticism of state rules that shrink access to clinics came from the justice widely predicted to cast the swing vote. In Texas, Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy pointed out, the number of medical abortions \u2014 the method used almost exclusively in early terminations \u2014 is falling faster than the surgical procedure, used for most later terminations. \u201cMy reading indicated that medical abortions are up nationwide, but down significantly in Texas,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThis may not be medically wise.",
        "Trashing the liberal arts seems to have become practically a sport among some politicians these days. Maybe they think that the \u201cliberal\u201d in \u201cliberal arts\u201d is a political reference, which it isn\u2019t. Kentucky Gov. Matthew Bevin (R) recently suggested that French literature majors should not get state funding for college tuition. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who is running for the Republican presidential nomination, said that welders earn more money than philosophy majors \u2014 fact checkers found this not to be true \u2014 while saying the country needs fewer philosophers and more welders.",
        "The District recently marked the first anniversary of its legalization of recreational marijuana. And as the city is home to so many people, it\u2019s likely that at least a few of them are wondering whether it makes sense, or whether it\u2019s even safe, to incorporate pot into their exercise regimens. Given the illegality of marijuana, there is not a large body of evidence about its effects on the human body. However, I spoke with a professional athlete who offered his own large body as testimony to the benefits of engaging in physical activity while stoned.",
        "Behold, the baby superstore: so many aisles of fabulous things for you and your baby. I remember the first time I walked into one such store, newly pregnant for the first time, excited to take a peek at my future. It was like being dropped on Mars. I had no nieces or nephews yet; my friends\u2019 babies were admired from afar. This was a confusing new frontier. Bottle brushes and diaper genies? What are boppy pillows for? Were convertible car seats for convertibles? I backed out of the store slowly. Maybe this trip wasn\u2019t necessary.",
        "Is there anything more stylish than living in a loft? It\u2019s a chic little word, conjuring images of brick walls, sleek concrete floors and expensive views. If you\u2019ve seen a romantic comedy in the past 10 years, the dreamboat always lives in a loft. Warehouse living has been chic since the 1970s, when an urban boom priced many Americans out of city centers and sent them in search of cheaper rents in grittier neighborhoods. And over the past decade, this look, called urban industrial, has come back in a big way.",
        "This post has been updated. As Donald Trump added to his delegate total on Saturday with primary and caucus victories in Louisiana and Kentucky, CNN commentator Sally Kohn offered a grim forecast of a Trump presidency \u2014 and suggested the media will be culpable. \u201dThere is a fine line between covering a candidate and amplifying a candidate,\u201d Kohn, a progressive activist, said during the cable channel\u2019s coverage of Saturday voting.",
        "FLINT, Mich. \u2014 Sen. Bernie Sanders heads into Sunday night\u2019s Democratic debate in Michigan attempting to slow rival Hillary Clinton\u2019s steady march to the Democratic nomination. The debate, which airs at 8 p. m. Eastern time on CNN, was added to the Democrats\u2019 schedule after Sanders emerged as a challenger. Clinton and Sanders will face off here in Flint, which was chosen to highlight a crisis that has paralyzed the American city. Both candidates have campaigned hard in Michigan, which they consider a bellwether for the fall election.",
        "Given his horrendous showing in this year\u2019s presidential race, it can be difficult to remember that Rick Santorum won 11 states in the 2012 Republican primaries. It can also be difficult to remember this because few of Santorum\u2019s wins were of the marquee variety. After a big if very narrow win in the Iowa caucuses, here\u2019s how Santorum\u2019s wins broke down: 6 primaries Iowa caucuses Colorado caucuses Minnesota caucuses Missouri nonbinding primary North Dakota caucuses Kansas caucuses 5 Southern primaries Oklahoma Tennessee Alabama Mississippi Louisiana That\u2019s it.",
        "Mitt Romney isn\u2019t trying to steal the Republican presidential nomination from the four remaining candidates. He has made that much clear. But the 2012 GOP nominee is nevertheless leaving the door open \u2014 just a crack \u2014 to the possibility of being drafted by his party at a contested convention in July.",
        "Voters in five states headed to the polls Saturday for four GOP presidential contests and three Democratic ones. While there was certainly less emphasis placed on the caucus states that provided the bulk of the action Louisiana was the lone primary there was plenty to comb through in the results. Below are our winners and losers. WINNERS Ted Cruz: Cruz won just two of the four states on Saturday, but the two he lost wound up being closer than expected and will probably be cast as signs of potential Cruz momentum.",
        "Nancy Reagan, a former film actress whose crowning role was that of vigilant guardian of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s interests and legacy, died March 6 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 94. The cause was congestive heart failure, her office said. As first lady from 1981 to 1989, Mrs. Reagan had a knack for inviting controversy \u2014 from her spending habits to her request that the White House abide by an astrologer when planning the president\u2019s schedule.",
        "By the time Nancy Reagan sat down with Mike Wallace of \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in 2002, her eyes had lost their familiar gleam. More than a decade out of the world\u2019s largest public spotlight, hers was now a life consumed by a torturous, private struggle. Her husband\u2019s generous spirit \u2014 once among the most commanding on Earth \u2014 had been reduced by Alzheimer\u2019s to a passing flicker of . In the White House, she\u2019d developed a reputation as a fierce protector of the president, even while surrounded by allies.",
        "Before her husband\u2019s policies made history, before she told the world to \u201cjust say no\u201d to drugs, before she set foot in the White House or California governor\u2019s mansion, Nancy Reagan was a lady of Hollywood. From 1948 to 1962, she appeared in movies and television shows, often playing the role of the loyal wife \u2014 the position she would come to be remembered for . She died March 6 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 94. Her acting career began in her Chicago high school, where she played the lead role in George S.",
        "\u201cSuper Saturday\u201d ended up being a Saturday night massacre for Marco Rubio. The establishment\u2019s landslide choice to win the GOP nomination no longer seems capable of even finishing in second place. If the Florida senator wants to salvage his political career, it is time that his quixotic quest for the White House comes to an end. After Iowa, Sen. Rubio promised his supporters he would rocket to the nomination on the strength of his strategy. But one month later, he finished tonight\u2019s contests . As Paul Begala said of Rubio, \u201cEverybody likes him but the voters.",
        "While I was growing up in the 1980s, Nancy Reagan, who passed away March 6 at the age of 94, wasn\u2019t my favorite. Then the first lady of the United States, wife of President Ronald Reagan, seemed to my teenage self a cold, stern figure who lectured us to \u201cJust Say No\u201d to drugs. The Hollywood glamour she and her husband brought to the White House those eight years only added to the distance \u2014 psychological and experiential \u2014 that seemed to be between her and me. That view of Reagan continued long after she left Washington.",
        "The first grade I got as a clueless, Yale freshman in 1992 was a . As a typically I felt the only thing to do was to complain during my professor\u2019s office hours. He listened as I pleaded my case, then patiently explained that, although the grade stood, he was certain that I would do better next time. \u201cThanks,\u201d I said, defeated. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be a C student in college. \u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cYou won\u2019t be.",
        "America\u2019s epidemic of heroin and addiction has become a major issue in the 2016 elections. It\u2019s worse than ever: Deaths from overdoses of opioids (the drug category that includes heroin and prescription analgesics such as Vicodin) reached an high in 2014, rising 14 percent in a single year. But because drug policy has long been a political and cultural football, myths about opioid addiction abound. Here are some of the most dangerous \u2014 and how they do harm. Maia Szalavitz is a journalist and author, most recently of the forthcoming \u201cUnbroken Brain: A Revolutionary New Way of Understanding Addictions.",
        "Peyton Manning made the right choice. It\u2019s been a month since the Denver Broncos, with Manning at quarterback but mostly along for the ride, beat the Carolina Panthers to give Manning his second career Super Bowl triumph. That was long enough for some to begin wondering if maybe, just maybe Manning would give it another shot and attempt to continue his legendary NFL career. [Peyton Manning decides to retire] But that won\u2019t be the case. Manning has decided to retire. He has informed the Broncos of that decision, according to a person familiar with the deliberations.",
        "Oberlin College\u2019s Board of Trustees has labeled social media posts by Joy Karega, an assistant professor of rhetoric and composition, as \u201c and abhorrent\u201d and has demanded that school leaders \u201cchallenge the assertion that there is any justification for these repugnant postings\u201d and report back. Karega has come under fire for sharing Facebook postings that have claimed, among other things, that \u201cIsraeli and Zionist Jews\u201d were responsible for the Sept.",
        "Gods usually get away with what they want. Whether transforming into a swan for sensual seduction or botching bad blood transfusions with Taylor Swift, even missteps are hailed as miracles. Kendrick Lamar prefers to call himself a king, but his parishioners insist on higher divinity. Few have questioned Lamar\u2019s infallibility over the last three years. His run has been mostly spectacular, but all flaws have been airbrushed. Last year\u2019s \u201cTo Pimp a Butterfly\u201d nabbed five Grammys, unanimous critical raves and instant induction into \u2019s pantheon for its sprawling ambition, virtuous musicianship and trenchant racial insight.",
        "ATLANTA \u2014 Jimmy Carter announced Sunday that he no longer needs treatment for cancer, less than seven months after revealing he had been diagnosed with melanoma that spread to his brain. Carter, 91, shared the news at one of his regular Sunday School classes at Maranatha Baptist Church in his hometown of Plains, Georgia. Carter always starts his lessons with a brief update on his recent activities. This week, Carter told the class, he received an MRI lasting more than 2 hours."
