        "MOSCOW \u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin has an 83 percent approval rating. Lyubov Kostyrya\u2019s job is to knock on doors to track it. Every week, Russian pollsters dispatch an army of workers to canvass the country\u2019s 11 time zones for people\u2019s views on Putin, the economy and other issues. And so Kostyrya visits one home after another to learn what Russians are thinking. Two years after Putin\u2019s ratings skyrocketed at the start of a geopolitical conflict with the West, they have stayed there, week after week, month after month.",

Doggedly determined to provide breast milk exclusively for their babies, these moms endure breast and nipple pain, around the clock pumping, sleep deprivation, anxiety, and chronic feelings of inadequacy \u2014 all for the sake of doing what\u2019s \u201cbest\u201d for their babies.",
        "There are very few products that I recommend over and over again, but the clear plastic shoebox is one of them. Sturdy, stackable and these boxes are not just good for storing shoes \u2014 they\u2019re also the perfect solution for organizing many household items. Notecards and greeting cards: If you buy a lot of greeting cards or stock up on them throughout the year, these boxes are the perfect size for storing them. The same holds true for boxed notecards.

Consider the reading light, which seems like the last thing anyone would fight about on a plane. Yet in a recent online chat, I made the mistake of suggesting that on an overnight flight, it might be polite to ask your seatmate whether it\u2019s okay to leave the light on.

        "PARK CITY, Utah \u2014 The presentation is an rebuttal to the fatalism permeating the Republican establishment: Slide by slide, state by state, it calculates how Donald Trump could be denied the nomination. Marco Rubio wins Florida. John Kasich wins Ohio. Ted Cruz notches victories in the Midwest and Mountain West. And the results in California and other states are jumbled enough to leave Trump three dozen delegates short of the 1, 237 required \u2014 forcing a contested convention in Cleveland in July.",
        "Oh dear. On Sunday night, Bernie Sanders was in the middle of explaining his rationale for having reservations about the 2008 auto bailout \u2014 too much of the aid went to Wall Street \u2014 when former secretary of state Hillary Clinton interrupted. Clinton got out a few words before Sanders, hand raised and moving in the (surprisingly tight) space between the two candidates and interjected. \u201dExcuse me, I\u2019m talking,\u201d he said. Now, compared to the rather raucous and raunchy content of the last GOP debate, that was not exactly a shocking or indecorous moment.",
        "The White House is considering nearly a relatively new federal judges for President Obama\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court, focusing on jurists with scant dis cern ible ideology and limited judicial records as part of a strategy to surmount fierce Republican opposition. As Obama prepares for what probably will be his last opportunity to try to shape the high court after the sudden death of Justice Antonin Scalia, the president faces an unprecedented hurdle, with the Senate\u2019s GOP majority vowing to ignore any nominee he proposes.",
        "ROBERTSDALE, Ala. \u2014 There are few clues that this is the home town of Apple chief executive Tim Cook, the place where he said his \u201cmost improbable journey\u201d began and where he forged the beliefs that today put him at the center of a national debate over privacy. His name is not noted on the town\u2019s welcome signs along the main drag, Route 59. There\u2019s nothing in the local chamber\u2019s brochures, and the local paper rarely has anything about him.",
        "A series of U. S. airstrikes aimed at the terrorist group killed more than 150 people, making it the deadliest operation against the militant group in more than a decade, the Pentagon said Monday. The strike occurred on Saturday and hit the Raso training camp approximately 120 miles north of Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia. There were believed to be no civilian casualties in the strike, although the Pentagon is still assessing the situation, according to a senior defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly about the operation.",
        "So it has come to this: The for the Republican presidential nomination, at a campaign rally in Orlando Saturday, leading supporters in what looked very much like a fascist salute. \u201cCan I have a pledge? A swearing?\u201d Trump asked, raising his right hand and directing his followers to do the same. He then led them in pledging allegiance \u2014 not to the flag, but to Trump, for which they stand and for whom they vowed to vote.

        "Danielle Allen is a political theorist at Harvard University and a contributing columnist for The Post. To all those who oppose Donald Trump: Stay the course.

On Friday, in a statement to the Wall Street Journal, they were out.",
        "It is amazing how little the Democratic race has really changed over the last several months. Hillary Clinton is the favorite to win the nomination. Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) is leading a revolt from the left. Sanders speaks to white ideological liberals and young Democrats. Clinton speaks to practically everyone else in the party \u2014 and, as \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d pointed out, provides a refuge for moderates terrified of the other options this election year. Nothing in Sunday night\u2019s debate changed any of this, which nets out to a loss for Sanders.",
        "It was William J. Bennett, education secretary in the Reagan years and the Republican Party\u2019s premier moralist, who embedded a phrase in the American consciousness when he bemoaned the fact that \u201cour elites presided over an unprecedented coarsening of our culture. \u201d Well, to borrow another famous phrase, it is Bennett\u2019s party and two of its presidential candidates in particular, Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, who are merrily defining our politics, our discourse and the American presidency down.",
        "Sunday\u2019s Democratic debate in Flint, Mich. had several memorable moments. The \u201cExcuse me! I\u2019m talking!\u201d shushing of Hillary Clinton by a Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) was a clear . But their discussion of race was most illuminating, for it showed Sanders\u2019s glaring inability to talk about beyond criminal justice reform and income inequality. Asked by an audience member about experiences they have had that helps them \u201cdeeply understand the mindsets and values of other cultures,\u201d Sanders and Clinton talked up their youthful activist resumes.",
        "Marco Rubio, the Republican establishment\u2019s golden position, is floundering. If he doesn\u2019t prevail in the Florida primary next Tuesday \u2014 and he\u2019s currently trailing there by percent \u2014 it may really be just a race, between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. That would leave GOP elites in a position where their only chance at stopping a candidate they find terrifying is a candidate they find loathsome. I\u2019m not going to argue that Ted Cruz is a great option for the GOP. But between him and Trump, it shouldn\u2019t even be a close call.",

        "An era that dawned with unbridled optimism came to an end Monday, as Robert Griffin III, the quarterback who appeared destined to restore the Washington Redskins\u2019 championship tradition, was released by the team. The move had been expected for months, assuming an air of inevitability after Griffin was demoted to the squad\u2019s third quarterback in August and Kirk Cousins, elevated in his stead, solidified his hold on the starting job by leading the team to the 2015 NFC East championship.",
        "On Saturday, pastor Tim Remington put his arm around Ted Cruz and then delivered a rousing invocation at a campaign rally in Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho. Now Remington is on the receiving end of prayers after being shot in the skull and back after his Sunday sermon. Early Monday morning, authorities identified a suspect in the unholy shooting: a local man and former Marine named Kyle Andrew Odom. As authorities launched a manhunt for Odom, questions remained over a possible motive, particularly whether the shooting was in any way related to Remington\u2019s appearance with Cruz roughly 24 hours earlier.",
        "In my years as a prosecutor, I saw plenty of violence, including many deaths. Some were accidental, but some were the work of killers, even serial killers. I have always been fascinated by serial killers. How do they choose their victims? How is it that they can take a life so easily? I studied them, tried to understand their behavior.

        "I still remember his words. \u201cDon\u2019t stop cruising,\u201d my husband told me the day before he died of cancer in 1997. Mason was a banker and real estate appraiser who introduced me to cruising. During our 50 years together, we had taken 89 cruises. Alone and struggling to maintain a large home after his death, I took my daughter\u2019s advice, sold our house and a lifetime\u2019s accumulation of furnishings and collectibles and became a permanent resident on a cruise ship.

The fabric had enough body to hold a shape, and that shape was of multiple rings and petals and the odd puzzle piece. They were connected with silver rivets. The model\u2019s head was covered in a black conical wig. And she crept slowly down the elevated runway in a pair of fuzzy . Comme des Garcons 2016 collection.",

In the United States, we are full steam ahead into what is turning out to be an if not outright contentious, election season. And nearly front and center is the issue of income inequality.

        "DETROIT \u2014 Voting was underway Tuesday in two states \u2014 Mississippi and Michigan \u2014 that are widely expected to solidify the leads of Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton in their respective nominating contests. The latest day of voting, which will also include a Republican primary in Idaho and GOP caucuses in Hawaii, comes at a time when the GOP establishment is in turmoil over how to stop Trump. On the Democratic side, Clinton\u2019s advantage in recent polls in Michigan and Mississippi suggests easy victories that would render Sanders\u2019s path to the Democratic nomination all but impossible.",
        "Donald Trump continues to lead his rivals nationally in the contest for the Republican presidential nomination. But his hold on the GOP electorate has weakened since the primary season began, and the party is now deeply divided over his candidacy, according to a new Washington News poll. Trump maintains the support of 34 percent of registered Republicans and independents, compared with 25 percent for Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, 18 percent for Sen.

        "Hillary Clinton never looked comfortable at Monday\u2019s town hall event in Detroit, her first appearance on the Fox News Channel in almost two years. She stood through much of her session with moderator Bret Baier, and her exclamation at the end \u2014 \u201cOh, my gosh, it went by so fast!\u201d \u2014 was thoroughly unconvincing. It had clearly been a grind."
