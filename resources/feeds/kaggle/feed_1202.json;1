        "Within minutes of Donald Trump asking thousands of his supporters at a rally in Orlando on Saturday afternoon to raise their right hands and \u201dsolemnly swear\u201d to vote for him, the comparisons were being made. Taken out of context, photos and video of the pledge looked like a large crowd saluting the Republican presidential which was reminiscent to some of Nazis saluting Adolf Hitler. When a Politico reporter asked Trump\u2019s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, about these comparisons on Saturday, she responded: \u201cWhat a disgusting thing to ask. A disgrace.",
        "Republican presidential candidates frequently complain about reporters, but they routinely face even greater ridicule by a wing of the media that makes no pretense to being fair and balanced \u2014 television\u2019s humorists. Donald Trump was recently the target of a harsh, unprecedented monologue by HBO\u2019s John Oliver, who uncovered Trump\u2019s ancestral name and urged viewers to \u201cMake Donald Drumpf Again. \u201d The segment has been viewed about 20 million times on YouTube.",
        "But for her \u201cimpressive architectural\u201d hair, as one blogger once put it, and her wealth, she is in some respects the polar opposite of her brother, Donald Trump. His life is a reality show. Hers, says Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, is \u201cvery private. \u201d His public speaking is raucous and . On the rare occasions when she speaks to a crowd, as she did in 2011 at the commencement of the Fairfield University, her words are carefully chosen, thoughtful and wise.",
        "Sen. Lindsey O. Graham couldn\u2019t remember the last time he spoke to Ted Cruz. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while,\u201d Graham ( . C.) said last week. Same for Ron Johnson ( .) a senator facing a difficult reelection in the fall. And Sen. Orrin G. Hatch ( ) whose last talk with the fiery GOP presidential candidate from Texas came a \u201cfew months ago. \u201d \u201cWe just chatted in general,\u201d Hatch, the Republican elder statesman on Capitol Hill, recalled last week.

        "CNN is well acquainted with the perils of reporting on the fate of presidential campaigns. On the night of the Iowa caucuses, it revealed on air that Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson was headed back to Florida, no matter how he did in the caucuses. \u201cAnd then afterwards, he\u2019s not going to go to South Carolina,\u201d said CNN chief political correspondent Dana Bash. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to go to New Hampshire.

        "For nine months, Republican leaders refused to take on Donald Trump when it would have done some good. Now that it may be too late, they\u2019re blaming their own failures on the media. \u201cThe media\u2019s pumping him up,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio ( .) complained. The Republican presidential candidate alleged that there\u2019s a \u201cweird bias here in the media rooting for Donald Trump because they know he\u2019s the easiest Republican to beat. \u201d Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation\u2019s capital.

        "Let\u2019s be honest, America. This is not a fun time in our nation\u2019s history. The political rise of Donald Trump has no doubt pleased his supporters, but it has stressed out many Americans. Economic anxieties, tensions with Russia, turmoil in the Middle East, concerns about China \u2014 they all add up to a constant hum of anxiety to anyone paying attention in the world. In this kind of situation, the need for some kind of diversion is powerful. Human beings need release valves when constantly inundated with stress.",
        "In fending off the challenge posed by Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) Hillary Clinton has wrapped herself around President Obama, touting her appointment as secretary of state as confirmation of his trust in her \u201cjudgment,\u201d while criticizing Sanders for not being ready for prime time as commander in chief. In fact, when it comes to foreign policy, there is little question that Sanders is closer to Obama\u2019s sensibility than is Clinton.

        "NEW YORK \u2014 In the long, bitter and rivalry between the New York Police Department and the FBI, few things aggravated the more than the repeated towing of their cars by the local cops. And the practice was one of the first things that NYPD Commissioner William J. Bratton banned when he took over in late 2013 and tried to defuse tensions with his most important counterterrorism partner. Relations between the NYPD and the FBI, never warm, deteriorated sharply after the Sept.",
        "TEL AVIV \u2014 Vice President Biden arrived in Israel on Tuesday to patch up, again, relations between the Obama White House and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after a very public and deeply partisan spat over the Iran nuclear deal. Biden went directly from the airport to meet with former Israeli president Shimon Peres in Tel Aviv. But even as the men spoke about the need for Israel to make peace with the Palestinians, less than a mile away a Palestinian went on a rampage in the quarter of Jaffa that left an American tourist dead.",
        "A man had just gone on a shooting rampage in Kalamazoo, Mich. allegedly killing six people while driving for Uber. Sherry Towers, an Arizona State University physicist who studies how viruses spread, worried while watching the news coverage. Last year, Towers published a study using mathematical models to examine whether mass shootings, like viruses, are contagious. She identified a period after mass shootings when the chance of another spikes. Her findings are confirmed more frequently than she would like. Five days after Kalamazoo, a man in Kansas shot 17 people, killing three by firing from his car.",

        "Georgetown University is at odds in a way again with Pope Francis confidante Cardinal Donald Wuerl after a student group invited Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards to speak on campus. \u201cThe apparent unawareness of those pushing the violence of abortion and the denigration of human dignity that there are other human values and issues \u2026 lends credence to the perception of the \u2018ivory tower\u2019 life of some on campus.

        "High over Alaska last summer, the Pentagon experimented with new, secret prototypes: that can be launched from the flare dispensers of moving and fighter jets. Canisters containing the tiny aircraft descended from the jets on parachutes before breaking open, allowing wings on each drone to swing out and catch the wind. propellers on the back provided propulsion as they found one another and created a swarm. The experiment was run by the secretive Strategic Capabilities Office, a Pentagon organization launched in summer 2012 to figure out how to best counter growing strategic threats from China and Russia.",

Bernie Sanders will meet for their fourth debate Wednesday evening in Miami \u2014 one night after Sanders won an upset victory in Michigan, reshaping their party\u2019s presidential race as Clinton seemed close to clinching it.

        "The Republican presidential campaign has entered what could be the most critical week of the primary season, with the party elites almost out of time to deny the GOP nomination to New York billionaire Donald Trump short of a potentially bloody fight at the national convention in July. Trump\u2019s easy victories in Michigan and Mississippi demonstrated appeal from the Deep South to the industrial Midwest that continued his impressive winning string and added to his lead in delegates. While not unexpected, his margins \u2014 especially in Michigan \u2014 were bigger than his rivals had hoped they would be.",
        "It was literally two weeks ago that the growls from Republicans worried about a possible Donald Trump nomination targeted John Kasich\u2019s presence in the 2016 presidential race as an obstacle to Marco Rubio\u2019s ascent. Those whines never made much sense; Kasich likely cost Rubio some delegates over the long term, but the real obstacle to Rubio\u2019s ascent was the same one he failed to vault on Tuesday night: Marco Rubio. It\u2019s hard to exaggerate what a debacle Tuesday night was for Rubio.",
        "The writer, a retired neurosurgeon, suspended his campaign for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination this month. The Republican presidential field is winnowing. By most accounts, all that\u2019s keeping Sen. Marco Rubio from getting drummed out of the race is one date and one state: March 15 and Florida. That\u2019s not much of a firewall for the establishment\u2019s last great hope. Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) is faring a bit better, yet everywhere I go, Cruz is the \u201cyeah, but . . . \u201d candidate.",
        "As your humble blogger has suggested, if Donald Trump tightens his grip on the GOP nomination, it could get harder and harder for Republicans to stick to their stance of refusing to give any consideration to President Obama\u2019s nominee (no matter who it is) to the Supreme Court. That\u2019s because GOP Senators \u2014 including vulnerable incumbents up for reelection this year \u2014 may be pressed to say whether they would really give President Trump\u2019s nominee a fair hearing, while denying one to Obama\u2019s.",
        "There reaches a time in every campaign in which the only people who are convinced that the candidate has a legitimate chance to win is the candidate himself and the most loyal (or ambitious) aides. The polls look rotten. Every argument against other candidates has been tried and lost. It\u2019s time to pack it in \u2014 especially if continued participation in the race involves a dangerous outcome to the party and the country \u2014 but no one, not even those with his interests at heart, has the nerve to tell the candidate.",
        "Tuesday in Michigan was brought to you by white men and the people from little towns and small cities. The outcome of a primary that shook the certainties in the Democratic presidential race while also ratifying the ongoing power of Donald Trump\u2019s coalition of discontent was determined by voters who don\u2019t trust trade deals and don\u2019t believe in the promises of the new economy. Trump and Bernie Sanders are as different as two politicians can be, yet both served as megaphones for a loud cry of protest from the and the ignored. E. J.",
        "For those of you salivating \u2014 or trembling \u2014 at the thought of Hillary Clinton being clapped in handcuffs as she prepares to deliver her acceptance speech at the Democratic convention this summer: deep, cleansing breath. Based on the available facts and the relevant precedents, criminal prosecution of Clinton for mishandling classified information in her emails is extraordinarily unlikely. My exasperation with Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state is and unabated. Lucky for her, political idiocy is not criminal.

        "When the drug company Novartis launched its breakthrough cancer medicine, Gleevec, in 2001, the list price was $26, 400 a year. The company\u2019s chief executive acknowledged it was expensive, calling it an \u201cuphill battle to win understanding for our decision. \u201d Today, that hill is a mountain. Since Gleevec was approved to treat a rare form of leukemia, similar drugs have come on the market \u2014 and the U.

Go, the smugglers said. Hungary isn\u2019t far. But when the migrants had finished hacking their way through a dense woodland, they found their paths blocked by a fence, with snarling German shepherds and Hungarian police standing watch on the other side. \u201cGo away!\u201d Musa a slender Afghan, recalled the police yelling. \u201cWe don\u2019t like migrants here.",
