        "AUSTIN \u2014 When President Obama lands here Friday to give a talk at this year\u2019s South by Southwest Interactive festival, he will enter the land of brisket, live music, \u201dthinkfluencers\u201d \u2014 and openly brandished firearms. For the third consecutive year, activists are using the yearly music and culture festival to bring attention to their defense of gun rights by openly carrying guns in public, as is legal in Texas. This year, however, there are a couple of twists: One, the open carry of handguns \u2014 as opposed to rifles and shotguns \u2014 is legal for the first time.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: At last night\u2019s debate, Donald Trump lorded it over his rivals with supreme confidence. Gone was narcissistic, rambling, Trump. In his place stood calm, unifying, presidential Trump. The Donald noted with satisfaction that his foes were mostly laying off of him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how civil it\u2019s been up here,\u201d he said, by which he really meant, \u201call you losers have surrendered to me, and I\u2019m loving every minute of it. \u201d And Trump may be right: it\u2019s possible that by next week, he will be on a path to winning the nomination outright.",
        "Haley Barbour Governor of Mississippi, 2004 to 2012; Republican National Committee chairman, 1993 to 1997 Republican primary voters, including party leaders, should support whomever they believe would be the best nominee for the GOP and the best president for the country. The nomination contest is almost halfway through, and Donald Trump has a little more than a third of the delegates needed to win at the convention in Cleveland. He is clearly in the best position, but there is a long road ahead.",
        "The lowest moment of last night \u2014 maybe the lowest of the election and in the history of the GOP \u2014 came before the debate, when Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus pledged that the RNC \u201cis going to support the nominee, whoever that is, 100 percent. \u201d This came on a day in which Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, despite an eyewitness and audio evidence, denied that its manager reporter Michelle Fields \u2014 and then savaged her as \u201cdelusional.",
        "Rachel Manteuffel works in The Post\u2019s Editorial department. I am about to cast the most consequential vote in my youngish inconsequential life. Because of a few accidents of history in this crazypants election cycle, and a weird strategic decision I made five years ago, I am about to hold more power in a national election than I have ever had, or will likely ever have again, or really ever should have.",
        "It has been an annual rite in Washington since the modern budgeting system began in 1974: The president sends his budget to Congress, and lawmakers hold hearings on it. But not this year. Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation s capital. He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s lips were moving again Tuesday night \u2014 and you know what that means. For what seemed like forever, but was really about an hour, the Republican treated America to another victory speech that was belligerent and, well, sporadically factual. Among his more obvious whoppers was this boast: \u201cIf I get to go against Hillary, polls are showing that I beat her. And some of the polls have me beating her very easily.",
        "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now says pregnant women can safely travel to countries if they stay at elevations higher than 6, 562 feet, where they\u2019ll find few mosquitoes that could spread the virus. But the agency\u2019s revised travel advisory, released Friday, continues to recommend that trips to areas be avoided because the greater presence of mosquitos increases the risk of infection. Until Friday, the CDC was cautioning pregnant women from traveling to the 37 countries and territories, primarily in the Americas, where the virus has spread rapidly.",
        "It was a good night for Canadian fashion. For the state dinner in honor of Canada on Thursday, first lady Michelle Obama turned to the designer of both her inaugural gowns, Jason Wu, who was born in Taiwan and raised in Vancouver. Drawing from his fall 2016 collection, which he presented on the runway last month in New York, Wu created a strapless gown in navy silk with a romantic floral print. It was a dress that acknowledged the importance and grandeur of the evening without the weight of stodgy, overwrought formality.",
        "MOSCOW \u2014 A former senior Kremlin aide died in a Washington hotel from blunt force trauma wounds \u2014 and now Moscow is filled with conspiracy theories about who might have wanted him dead. The November death of Mikhail Lesin, initially reported by his family as a heart attack, immediately generated skepticism from Kremlin critics. In a world in which agents are poisoned in London by radioactive tea and the lawyers of Kremlin critics die in Moscow prisons, the death of Lesin, 57, at a Dupont Circle hotel was bound to raise eyebrows. Now the revelation from the D. C.",
        "Russia\u2019s military is looking for a few good dolphins to join its navy \u2014 five, to be exact, with perfect teeth, average length and a willingness to \u201cdisplay motor activity. \u201d That\u2019s according to a Defense Ministry tender that was published online this week. It offered about $24, 000 to a broker who could supply three male and two female bottlenose dolphins, each about eight feet long, for the service of the Russian state.",
        "Tyrone Williams and Chauntyll Allen said they went to Joe\u2019s Crab Shack in Roseville, Minn. on Wednesday night for a friend\u2019s early birthday dinner when they looked down at their table and saw it: a photograph, embedded inside of the table, depicting the public hanging of a black man. \u201cIt had a cartoon character saying, \u2018All I said was \u201cI didn\u2019t like the gumbo,\u2019\u201d in a joking manner,\u201d Williams said at a news conference Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m appalled,\u201d Allen said at the news conference, organized by the Minneapolis NAACP.",
        "The family\u2019s nightmare began before dawn Thursday. It was already pouring outside when the husband woke around 4 a. m. The rain wouldn\u2019t stop for hours. It would end up as the wettest March 10 ever recorded in Vicksburg, Miss. The husband swung his legs out of bed. He picked up his son. Then he walked toward the garage to start his wife\u2019s car. That\u2019s when Rafael McCloud slipped out of the shadows with a knife.",
        "On a Monday last month, the residents of a village in southern India organized special prayers for an American judge nearly 9, 000 miles away. The federal judge\u2019s father was born in the village, called Mela Thiruvenkatanathapuram, and now the son had surfaced as a possible justice of the U. S. Supreme Court. \u201cIt is a proud moment for all of us,\u201d said one resident, according to the Hindu newspaper. Such pride reflects the attention now focused on Sri Srinivasan, 49, a member of the U. S.",
        "UPDATE 11:35 A. M. The deed is done. Johnny Manziel is no longer a member of the Cleveland Browns, who apparently have failed in their attempts to trade the former Heisman Trophy winner and draft pick. The #Browns announce they\u2019ve waived QB Johnny Manziel. \u2014 Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) March 11, 2016 The news release about the roster move contained little more than statistics.

        "Washington Redskins owner Daniel Synder doesn\u2019t know where the future home of his football team will be but he\u2019s already got an idea of what he wants it to look like. Danish architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group, hired recently by Snyder to design a new stadium for the team, unveiled a model of the proposed project recently to \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d which plans to air a story on the company Sunday. The images released by the program show a hyperbolic stadium surrounded by a moat for kayakers.",
        "March 2013: Farmer Naoto Matsumura, 53, speaks during an interview at his house in Tomioka, inside the nuclear exclusion zone surrounding the Fukushima nuclear plant. (Greg ) Naoto Matsumura, a former rice farmer, lives in Tomioka, Japan, six miles from the Fukushima Daichi nuclear power plant and within the 12. nuclear exclusion zone. He lives alone, except for the 50 cows, two ostriches, dogs, cats and other animals in his care. When the earthquake and ensuing tsunami struck Japan in March 2011, the reactor meltdown forced the government to evacuate everyone living inside the exclusion zone.",
        "They\u2019d laughed at Donald Trump. They\u2019d called him a fake conservative. They made fun of his spray tan, his Twitter typos and the hands he\u2019d used to type them. Yet until Friday night, Trump\u2019s three remaining rivals for the Republican presidential nomination generally agreed that the whose presidential campaign was filling arenas and driving up voter turnout, was tapping into legitimate anger. That has changed perhaps for good. In statements from last night and Saturday morning, Sens. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Ohio Gov.",
        "In the wake of last night\u2019s canceled Chicago rally, Donald Trump has taken to blaming Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) and supporters of his Democratic Party bid for president for incitement. He debuted the argument on Friday night\u2019s cable news coverage, as footage of protesters cheering \u201dBernie\u201d played under Trump\u2019s interviews. He honed the argument at rallies Saturday. \u201dThey were taunted, they were harassed by these other people,\u201d said Trump at his morning rally in Dayton, Ohio. \u201dThese other people, by the way, some represented Bernie, our communist friend.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s ascendance is nothing if not surprising. Pundits thought he would flame out early; he has done things that could have ended other campaigns; and his statements are erratic and even sometimes contradictory. Yet, he remains the leading Republican presidential contender. Many have tried to explain Trump\u2019s rise in the nine months since he entered the race, and now President Obama can be counted among them: He offered up his analysis of Trump and the broader fight for the Republican presidential nomination during a speech Friday afternoon at a Democratic National Committee event at Texas\u2019s Austin Music Hall.",
        "VANDALIA, Ohio \u2014 Friday was an ugly day on the campaign trail, perhaps the worst of the year. What erupted in St. Louis and fully boiled over later in Chicago, however, was no aberration. Donald Trump has built his candidacy on resentment and grievance. It is a poisonous combination, for the Republican Party and for the country. Trump\u2019s slogan is Make America Great Again, but his campaign for president continues to call out dark forces that divide a polarized America. Fueled by acrimonious rhetoric, he has sparked an angry movement that has now created an angry backlash.",
        "As Donald Trump continues to surge forward as the Republican nominee, perfectly sane people are beginning to wonder: \u201cWas there something we missed? Maybe he\u2019s not really so bad. \u201d Shed that and purge the thought. You\u2019re not wrong \u2014 and he\u2019s that bad. Just ask the Breitbart reporter who was roughed up at a recent Trump rally. And she\u2019s one of the \u201cgood\u201d people. Imagine what happens to his critics once a Trump presidency takes shape. Kathleen Parker writes a column on politics and culture. She received the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary In 2010.",
        "Frequently predicted but never reached, \u201cpeak oil\u201d \u2014 maximum possible production \u2014 has been postponed yet again, this time because of fracking. \u201cPeak Sanders\u201d was prematurely announced because of persistent underestimations of how underwhelming Hillary Clinton is as a candidate. The Vermont senator\u2019s peak might not arrive soon because his fundraising prowess will allow him to continue campaigning to outlaw fracking.",
        "The accomplishments of four leaders recognized this week at the Women in the World salon in Washington \u2014 a Tina platform for women on the front lines of change around the world \u2014 are . The honorees\u2019 compelling and inspirational stories put to shame, by comparison, the puerile behavior of the top Republicans seeking to occupy the world\u2019s most powerful office. When GOP presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Donald Trump are not extolling their own virtues, they are, for the world to see, indulging in gibes about genitalia.",
        "THE REPUBLICAN presidential race, the headlines tell us, suddenly turned civil and substantive this week. When the candidates faced off in their last debate before Tuesday\u2019s crucial primaries in Florida and Ohio, they did not trade petty insults or discuss body parts. Instead, Donald Trump merely stated that \u201cthere is tremendous hate\u201d among \u201clarge portions\u201d of the world\u2019s 1. 6 billion Muslims. \u201cWe better solve the problem before it\u2019s too late,\u201d Mr. Trump said. A debate is not civil when it includes this kind of ignorant stereotyping.",
        "GAZIANTEP, TURKEY \u2014 To get rid of one bad man, you open the door to many. That is a rough translation of the slogan Wael Ibrahim had written on the banner he was preparing for the next demonstration he and his fellow democracy activists were planning in the Syrian city of Aleppo. It was February 2013, and Ibrahim, a truck driver who had become a leader in the protests against President Bashar was trying, as diplomatically as possible, to sustain the spirit of the original revolt without offending the newly ascendant and increasingly extremist Islamists. He failed.",
        "The little city of Sweetwater, Texas, has 11, 000 residents and one very big event each year. It features a pageant, food stands and contests, but the centerpiece is a bloody hunt: Thousands of Western diamond rattlesnakes are rounded up, milked of their venom and then beheaded and skinned in front of crowds at a county coliseum.",
        "ANCHORAGE, Alaska \u2014 A man on a snowmobile purposely drove into two dog teams competing in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race early Saturday morning, killing one dog and injuring at least three others, officials said. Mushers Aliy Zirkle and Jeff King were attacked outside the village of Nulato, a community of 236 on the Yukon River a little more than halfway into the race to Nome.

        "For the second time in a month, leading scientists have closely tied the ancient history of the vast Antarctic ice sheet to a key planetary parameter that humans are now controlling \u2014 the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Last month, new research showed that during the Miocene era, some 14 to 23 million years ago, Antarctica gave up huge volumes of ice, equivalent to tens of meters of sea level rise, when levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are thought to have been around 500 parts per million.",
        "Israel Kristal is 112 years and 178 days old. That\u2019s quite an achievement. On Friday, representatives of Guinness World Records came to his home in Haifa, Israel, to officially give him a certificate. He\u2019s now officially the world\u2019s oldest living man. Remarkably, it\u2019s even more of an achievement than it sounds. Kristal was born in Poland on Sept. 15, 1903. He survived World War I as a child, but his father, his sole remaining parent, was killed by Russian soldiers during the conflict."
