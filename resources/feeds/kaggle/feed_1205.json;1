        "LOS ANGELES \u2014 \u201cEverybody got a cutting. \u201d Henry Winkler is jumping back to West 78th Street now, telling the story of a plant. It\u2019s not just the story of a plant, it\u2019s likely the only story of a plant that includes an escape from Nazi Germany, the sitcom hero named the Fonz and the acclaimed Amazon series \u201cTransparent. \u201d But let\u2019s get back to the story. \u201cI grew up with a woman, Tanta Erma,\u201d Winkler explains. Erma wasn\u2019t a blood relative. Almost all of Winkler\u2019s extended family died during World War II.",

        "When staying at a hotel, each generation in a family often has different needs. My mother, for instance, wants a dresser and a separate room with a TV and couch. I angle for HBO and a coffeepot \u2014 not Keurig, but a real glass pot. My niece and nephew clamor for a pool. And if we adopted some millennials, they would have their own set of demands. As the Generation of the Moment, they certainly earned that entitlement. Bathrooms in the hotel include features such as toilets and refillable shampoo and conditioner pumps.",
        "Michael Garvey has about 2 1 2 minutes of material, and it\u2019s rough. It\u2019s also heartfelt \u2014 and angry. He opens with a joke about being from a Catholic family, \u201craised off fairy tales and . \u201d After all, his mother needed something to keep all her kids in line. Garvey\u2019s voice shakes just a touch, but maybe it\u2019s only nerves. It\u2019s his first time in front of his comedy class filled with fellow vets. He has taken the stage alone.",
        "Donald Trump wanted to market a line of men\u2019s clothes that would bear his name. He told people working with him to help find a company known for producing quality merchandise on a mass scale. In the end, Trump signed on with Heusen, a manufacturer of affordable shirts produced in factories in 85 countries.",
        "Know that old cliche \u201dWhere there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire?\u201d That has been running through my head for the past couple of days, watching violence flare on the campaign trail in and around Donald Trump\u2019s rallies. Trump, for his part, insists that he is blameless. \u201dI don\u2019t accept responsibility,\u201d he told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd Sunday morning when asked about the tenor of his rallies and the skirmishes between protesters and supporters that have become increasingly commonplace.",
        "CHICAGO \u2014 When Bernie Sanders launched his bid for the presidency 10 months ago, there were two words that rarely crossed his lips: Hillary Clinton. Now he can\u2019t seem to stop talking about her \u2014 and not much of what he has to say is very nice. During a boisterous rally here, the senator from Vermont dinged Clinton for supporting a series of \u201cdisastrous\u201d trade deals. He mocked her for refusing to release transcripts of paid speeches she gave to Wall Street firms. He recounted how she was wrong to vote for the Iraq war in 2002.",
        "Republican Rick Snyder called himself #onetoughnerd when he swept into the Michigan governor\u2019s office in 2010, winning election easily after pledging to run the state more like the businesses that generated his substantial wealth. Although he was a elected official, by 2012 he was considered a possible running mate for the Republican presidential nominee, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney. A few years later, he was actively exploring his own bid for president. Yet now, as he prepares for congressional hearings on the debacle in Flint, Mich. a new Twitter hashtag to describe Snyder might be #onedonedude.",
        "MIAMI \u2014 It was after midnight when she finally arrived at the hotel here after a couple of delayed flights. But before heading upstairs to reunite with her husband, who had just won a stunning upset in the Michigan primary, Jane Sanders made her way to a television crew set up for a live shot from the lobby. With several of Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s aides still celebrating at the bar visible in the background, Jane Sanders confidently summed up what had happened.",

By Thomas Frank. Metropolitan Books. 305 pp. $27. The race for the Democratic nomination is a battle over the legacy of the Obama presidency.

        "In 1951, William F. Buckley declared the university to be a den of atheism and in his book \u201cGod and Man at Yale,\u201d launching a campaign against higher education that has helped define postwar conservatism.

        "I\u2019m an environmentalist, and I try to make green choices. I take public transportation, recycle and program my thermostat. But the care and keeping of our forests always seemed far removed from my urban self. At least, it did until I visited a coffee farm in the Ecuadorian rain forest. There, I saw firsthand the way copper miners and loggers are destroying the natural environment. Forests cover 30 percent of the Earth\u2019s land, but they\u2019re disappearing fast. Companies and governments are converting green space into farms and developments; loggers are hacking away trees.",
        "Two years ago last month, I filed a request to the Federal Emergency Management Agency as part of my reporting into the flawed response to Hurricane Sandy. Then, I waited. The Freedom of Information Act requires a response within 20 business days, but agencies routinely blow that deadline. Eight months later, ProPublica and NPR published our investigation into the Sandy response, but it did not include any documents from FEMA. The agency had simply never gotten back to me. Finally, this Feb.",
        "Even if Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump don\u2019t win the presidency, their candidacies have roiled the waters of American party politics. Within the GOP, those white voters who began migrating from the Democrats 50 years ago have become restive. On the Democrats\u2019 side, young voters are repudiating the \u201cthird way\u201d politics favored by party elites. Are these fleeting disturbances, or do they suggest that some dramatic change is in store for U. S. political parties? To answer that question, it helps to look backward.",

        "They spent the season building some of the more fearsome profiles in the 2016 NCAA tournament bracket. But with Cinderella lurking behind every bend in the bracket, all it takes is one slip for title dreams to be stamped out by glass slippers.
