        "Desperate times call for desperate measures. The organized protest in Chicago that led Donald Trump to cancel a planned rally Friday may someday be remembered as the dawn of the resistance. Trump has fueled his campaign\u2019s rise with the angriest and most divisive political rhetoric this nation has heard since the days of George Wallace. No one should be surprised if some of those Trump has slandered or outraged respond with raised voices.

        "If Nathaniel Lewis is not careful, he\u2019s going to get Donald Trump elected. Lewis was one of the organizers of the demonstration in Chicago that closed down a Trump campaign event. He is a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and an African American, like many of the protesters. The idea was to shout something to disrupt Trump\u2019s speech and then, linking arms, stand silently in a circle. The plan, however, went awry. Trump canceled the event and violence erupted, possibly changing the nature of the campaign and the year. It is now approaching 1968.",
        "Gina McCarthy is administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. This week, I will testify along with Gov. Rick Snyder and others from Michigan and Flint about the health crisis in the city. This conversation is needed because what happened in Flint should not have happened. The crisis is the result of a emergency manager deciding that, to save money, Flint would stop purchasing treated drinking water from a source it relied on for 50 years and instead switch to an untreated source. The state of Michigan approved that decision, and it did so without requiring corrosion control.",
        "Susan Senator is author of \u201cAutism Adulthood: Strategies and Insights for a Fulfilling Life. \u201d A while back, someone at a conference told me that intellectually disabled people with guardians could not vote. I believed it and stuffed away thoughts about taking my severely autistic son, Nat, to get registered. It was one more stinging \u201cno\u201d in his life. I should be used to it by now, but I\u2019m not. Recently, however, I noticed the Twitter hashtag #CripTheVote, which is a rallying call to political candidates to take note of this huge constituency.",
        "Obama Derangement Syndrome is striking Republicans once again. To avoid having to answer for the rise of Donald Trump, they want to hold the man in the White House responsible for the emergence of a demagogic showman who has been the loudest voice challenging the legal right of the winner of two elections to be there. E. J. Dionne writes about politics in a column and on the PostPartisan blog.",
        "In a case that\u2019s almost too strange to be true, even for Silicon Valley, venture capitalist Michael Goguen admitted in court papers Monday that, yes, he paid the first $10 million of a $40 million contract to the woman he had a sexual relationship with for 13 years and who was not his wife; but, no, she was never his \u201csexual slave\u201d and he only agreed to sign the unusual contract because he worried about a \u201cshakedown\u201d featuring \u201cfalse and libelous claims\u201d of abuse. But then Goguen failed to pay up. Some $30 million remains on the contract today.",
        "A week ago in Middle America, a father and son piled into an old red Pontiac and hit the road for a weekend outing. \u201cDad, can I say, \u2018The truth hurts\u2019?\u201d the asked. \u201cNo, son, that\u2019s my line!\u201d the father said. \u201cYou can say, \u2018Who are you voting for?\u2019 \u201d \u201cTrump! Trump! Trump!\u201d the son rehearsed in the back seat as his dad gunned it down a potholed highway in North Canton, Ohio, until they reached a Kmart parking lot where people were starting to rally around a huge American flag.",
        "Breitbart News Network likes to think of itself as a \u201cFight Club\u201d for journalists eager to punch it out with politicians and politicos. Now its staff is fighting amongst itself. In the span of six weird and wild days, the popular and often outlandish conservative website has been beset by recriminations and rants, leaks and . The rolling spectacle features one criminal complaint; one video being analyzed with Zapruder intensity; one story published (then unpublished) under the fake name of an aggrieved reporter\u2019s father; and six resignations (at least, at last count).",
        "CAMP MOBILE, South Korea \u2014 Inside a dark chemistry lab in a derelict old building, Pvt. Charles Kimiaga gingerly drew 13 milliliters of an unknown brown liquid from a glass flask up into a syringe. Breathing through a gas mask that made him sound like Darth Vader, he was careful not to spill a drop as he put it into a sample jar. Who knew what chemical weapons the North Koreans had been making here? \u201cRemove the tubing from the syringe and be mindful of the needle \u2014 it might come out,\u201d Sgt. Tyler Lawrence said from behind him.",
        "Kim Pace was afraid he was dying. In six months he had lost more than 30 pounds because a terrible stabbing sensation on the left side of his face made eating or drinking too painful. Brushing his teeth was out of the question and even the slightest touch triggered waves of agony and a shocklike pain he imagined was comparable to electrocution. Painkillers, even morphine, brought little relief.",
        "Leona Barnes doesn\u2019t remember when, back around the close of World War I, she met Gladys Butler, Ruth Hammett and Bernice Underwood. Growing up in Southwest Washington, they were part of the landscape, in the same way that her house and her street and her church were. As little girls, the four played jacks and jumped rope; later they shared gossip and danced the and the Charleston. Two of them lived in the same house at one point, and three of them had babies the same year \u2014 1933.",
        "Tyrannosaurs didn\u2019t used to be so scary. For millions of years, they were kind of puny, never bigger than a horse. They probably lurked in the underbrush while larger dinosaurs like Allosaurus ruled the land as the top predators. Jump forward to the end of the Cretaceous Era, and we see the astonishing creature we call Tyrannosaurus rex, a monster with a giant head, teeth as big as bananas and powerful jaws that could bite through bone.",
        "Google\u2019s car knows how to run yellow lights. But unlike regular humans, it doesn\u2019t have to guess whether it\u2019ll beat the countdown. Instead, it turns what for many of us is a decision based on experience and guts into a heavily calculated dance of probability, speed and trajectory. Roughly 230 feet before it hits an intersection, it scans the light with its cameras and, based on the thousands of other data points it\u2019s tracking in its surroundings, the car will make the right call.",
        "A senior member of the Saudi royal family has criticized comments made by Barack Obama in a recent magazine article, suggesting that the U. S. president\u2019s harsh remarks about the kingdom were a \u201dcurveball\u201d in America\u2019s relationship with one of its main Arab allies. Prince Turki made his criticism of Obama\u2019s comments in an open letter, \u201dMr Obama. We are not \u2019free riders,\u2019\u201d published Monday in the Arab News newspaper.

        "Ohio Gov. John Kasich has been projected to win the Republican presidential primary in his home state on Tuesday evening \u2014 denying businessman Donald Trump a crucial victory in a \u201c \u201d state, and significantly raising the probability that no candidate will win the GOP nomination outright, and the party will barrel toward its first contested convention since 1976.

        "During Monday night\u2019s MSNBC town hall the 200th so far this month, by our count Bernie Sanders made a comment that raised some eyebrows among supporters of Hillary Clinton. Asked by an Ohio voter why he chose to run as a Democrat, despite having served for years as an independent, Sanders explained his thinking. \u201dWe did have to make that decision: Do you run as an independent?

        "Remember the days when the GOP was riding high, dominating all levels of government with high hopes of controlling both houses of Congress and the White House?

        "TAMPA \u2014 Before Donald Trump revealed himself to his ecstatic believers at the Tampa Convention Center on Monday afternoon, his terrible retinue stormed the stage. One dreadful surrogate after the other brought portents of the Donald\u2019s arrival, each exemplifying an aspect of the candidate set to take this state in Tuesday\u2019s Republican primary.

        "When documentarian Ken Burns and Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. kicked off a national speaking tour on race in Charleston, S.

The agency is recommending that drugs be prescribed whenever possible and that when opioids are given to patients, low doses and less than a week\u2019s supply should be provided.

The claim, published by Iranian state media, marks the latest example of how the authorities in Tehran has kept an incident considered embarrassing to the United States in the media in the two months since it occurred.
