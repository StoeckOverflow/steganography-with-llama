        "President Obama seems to be making good his pledge to nominate a Supreme Court justice. Apparently, he has interviewed three candidates for the job: Chief Judge Merrick Garland and Judge Sri Srinivasan from the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and Judge Paul Watford from the 9th Circuit. Nominating an Asian American such as Srinivasan would be momentous, as we\u2019ve written elsewhere, especially considering the Supreme Court\u2019s checkered history with Asian immigrants.",
        "As FX\u2019s gripping, magnificent Cold War drama \u201cThe Americans\u201d jumps into its fourth season Wednesday night with its usual hypertension, its makers are always quick to remind us that their show is first and foremost about a marriage. The show is also about a pair of killer Soviet spies in the early 1980s who are so entrenched in their lifelong mission that they\u2019re hiding in plain sight in the Northern Virginia suburbs.",
        "Investigators in Texas are searching for a missing teenage girl who is \u201cbelieved to be in grave or immediate danger\u201d after her father was found dead on a rural property over the weekend, officials say. Adriana Coronado vanished sometime after she was seen in the Houston suburb of Katy about 1 a. m. Saturday, according to an Amber Alert from the Texas Department of Public Safety.

        "President Obama nominated Merrick Garland to serve on the U. S. Supreme Court, calculating that choosing the highly regarded jurist who has served presidents from both parties will ultimately force Senate Republicans to drop plans to block his nomination. Garland, the chief judge of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and a moderate, does not fit neatly into a category that is likely to mobilize Democratic voters in an election year.",
        "Merrick Garland has the opportunity to become not only the newest member of the Supreme Court but also its most influential, taking a spot at the court\u2019s center now reserved for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. If the Garland is confirmed by the Senate \u2014 and there is no bigger if in all of Washington politics \u2014 he would help fulfill President Obama\u2019s goal of remaking the court and become a part of a liberal majority chosen by Obama and President Bill Clinton.",
        "Senate Republicans are not budging in their refusal to consider President Obama\u2019s choice for the Supreme Court after the president officially nominated Merrick Garland to replace the late justice Antonin Scalia. And the top Senate Republican \u2014 Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) \u2014 said he would not meet with Garland, who is the chief judge of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, when the judge comes to Capitol Hill to make the rounds on Thursday. After Garland was nominated Wednesday morning, McConnell spoke with him by phone.",
        "On April 19, 1995, as the first reports came in about a bombing in Oklahoma City, some of the federal government\u2019s top prosecutors gathered in the office of Merrick Garland \u2014 who at the time was the to the Justice Department\u2019s . Somebody turned on the TV. \u201cWe saw bodies of those young children being pulled out of the rubble. It was enormously moving to us on many levels, including as parents of young children,\u201d recalled Jamie S. Gorelick, Garland\u2019s boss. All told, 19 children died in the explosion at the Alfred P.",
        "Two groups leading the charge against Republican Donald Trump vowed to soldier on after his latest primary wins even as many senior party figures and donors retreated to the sidelines Wednesday, struggling to take stock of the careening presidential contest. As Trump\u2019s delegate lead expanded, there were signs of further polarization within the party. Florida Gov. Rick Scott urged Republicans to unite behind the billionaire developer and begin preparing for the general election. Meanwhile, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a top surrogate for former candidate Marco Rubio of Florida, told reporters Wednesday that she was \u201cprivately praying\u201d for Sen.",
        "Trailing in the hunt for delegates but still winning important state contests, the No. 2 Democrat in a primary had this to say about whether it was time to withdraw to make way for the : \u201cThe more people get a chance to vote, the better it is for our democracy. \u201d That was not Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in 2016. It was Hillary Clinton in 2008, answering calls in March that year to pull out and endorse Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois. She refused to leave the race until June.",
        "It was a good night for Donald Trump and an even better night for Hillary Clinton. On one of the most important days of the primary season, the two continued what has become an inexorable march to their party\u2019s presidential nominations and a general election matchup that was unimagined when this campaign began. For Clinton, it was a night to bounce back after her surprising defeat in Michigan at the hands of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont last week. She did so in stunning fashion.",
        "DONALD TRUMP\u2019S primary victories Tuesday present the Republican Party with a stark choice. Should leaders unite behind Mr. Trump, who has collected the most delegates but may reach the convention in July without a nominating majority? Or should they do everything they can to deny him the nomination? On a political level, this may be a dilemma. As a moral question, it is straightforward. The mission of any responsible Republican should be to block a Trump nomination and election. We do not take this position because we believe Mr. Trump is perilously wrong on the issues, although he is.",
        "Garrison Keillor is an author and radio personality. After Tuesday\u2019s voting, several folks I know are talking about leaving the country if and when the Great White Snapping Turtle is elected president, and of course Canada is the favored destination: predominant, handsome young progressive prime minister, socialized medicine, nonstop air connections \u2014 plus parallel geography of rockbound East, Midwestern prairies and Western mountain ranges. Well, I\u2019m not up for it. For one thing, I\u2019m lazy.",
        "Whatever you think of Donald Trump, his political achievement is enormous, and he deserves the credit. With no background in elected office, Trump has led the Republican presidential field for eight months. His strong plurality has proved to be demographically and geographically diverse. He has soundly beaten a series of talented, opponents. He has effectively tapped into anger and resentment, promising the recovery of a nation that his followers regard as weak, lost and unrecognizable.

        "Sen. John Cornyn recalls visiting a Texas prison where some inmates taking shop classes could not read tape measures. Cornyn, who was previously a district court judge and Texas Supreme Court justice, knows that prisons are trying to teach literacy and vocations, trying to cope with the mental illnesses of many inmates and trying to take prophylactic measures to prevent recidivism by people imprisoned for drug offenses. \u201cThe system,\u201d he says, \u201chas become by default a social services provider. \u201d It is not, however, equipped to perform so many functions.",
        "President Obama, in nominating Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, appears to be laboring under a misapprehension that the confirmation process is on the level. \u201cI hope they are fair. That\u2019s all: I hope they are fair,\u201d Obama said Wednesday morning in the Rose Garden, with the nominee at his side. He said he would \u201csimply ask Republicans in the Senate to give him a fair hearing and then an vote. \u201d Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation\u2019s capital.

        "Maybe sometimes, even in this crazy town and in this crazy season, the best policy turns out to be the best politics. In the context of the Supreme Court vacancy, President Obama\u2019s choice of Merrick Garland may be the hardest for Republicans to reject \u2014 or, as they would prefer to have it, ignore. Not that Garland\u2019s confirmation is by any means likely; I\u2019d rate his chances for the high court higher than John Kasich\u2019s for the GOP nomination, though that\u2019s not saying much.",

        "PROVIDENCE, R. I. \u2014 Of the 68 teams chosen for the NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournament, the most confusing might be Yale, its recent weeks crammed with mirth and woe. It has reached Providence as the giddy team that stanched Yale\u2019s absence from the coveted event, and also as the wary team shorn of a senior captain expelled from the school on Feb. 26, after the university ruled he had violated its policy.

        "The first thing resembling music at Saturday\u2019s Donald Trump rally comes from the crowd waiting outside of Cleveland\u2019s Center, barking their man\u2019s name in vicious staccato. The sound rips clear across the parking lot, where six cops on horseback patrol the blacktop, expecting the worst. That\u2019s because Trump\u2019s rallies have become malignant assemblies where violence is not only tolerated, but encouraged without shame and practiced without remorse.",

        "DAMASCUS, Syria \u2014 Since Moscow lent its air power to the Syrian government\u2019s war, Russian leader Vladimir Putin has achieved cult status in Damascus.

        "The Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged today and lowered its economic forecasts after a turbulent start to the year in financial markets and lackluster U. S. growth persuaded the central bank to reassess the timing and magnitude of its plan to raise rates.

        "Donald Trump\u2019s unorthodox campaign is causing growing anxiety over how U. S. trade, military and diplomatic policies would change if he were elected president, according to ambassadors from every continent. Diplomats from many of the United States\u2019 closest allies said there has not been a U. S. election since World War II in which representatives of foreign nations have felt so completely cut off from a leading presidential candidate or so unsure of his view of foreign policy. \u201cScary.

But if anything, most signs this morning are that Republicans are only digging in harder behind their stance that only the next president should pick Antonin Scalia\u2019s replacement."
