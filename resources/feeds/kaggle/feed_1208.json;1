        "Donald Trump will be the GOP\u2019s presidential nominee. Within the party, talk of a brokered Republican National Convention or even a supporting a candidate has circulated among those hoping to stop him from becoming the next president, leaving Trump antagonists across the spectrum to ponder whether there\u2019s any left, after November, to stop a Trump administration from becoming a reality. There is. The Electoral College. If they choose, state legislators can appoint presidential electors themselves this November, rather than leaving the matter of apportioning Electoral College votes by popular vote.",
        "A bipartisan foreign policy group, the McCain Institute, has put out a letter, signed by 139 foreign policy heavyweights, to the five remaining presidential candidates. It makes three major points. First, democracy is in retreat around the world, which is bad for the United States. \u201cRepressive regimes are inherently unstable and must rely on suppressing democratic movements and civil society to stay in power,\u201d the letter notes. \u201cThey also are the source and exporter of massive corruption, a pervasive transnational danger to stable democratic governance throughout the world.",
        "Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland visited the Capitol on Thursday, where many Republican senators have said they will not even meet with him. But GOP lawmakers are also talking to reporters about the possibility of confirming Garland later this year, should Hillary Clinton win the election. Sen. Lindsey Graham ( . C.) doesn\u2019t like the idea: \u201cWe can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d he said Wednesday. Oh, yeah? Watch them. How could Republicans vote to confirm President Obama\u2019s nominee when they have been arguing that the next president should make the choice? Here\u2019s how.",
        "Each week, In Theory takes on a big idea in the news and explores it from a range of perspectives. This week, we\u2019re talking about sports fandom. Need a primer? Catch up here. Marco Iacoboni is a professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author of \u201cMirroring People. \u201d It\u2019s that time of the year: March Madness.

        "Ten years ago, an Irish pub owner was clearing land for a driveway when his digging exposed an unusually large flat stone. The stone obscured a dark gap underneath. He grabbed a flashlight to peer in. \u201dI shot the torch in and saw the gentleman, well, his skull and bones,\u201d Bertie Currie, the pub owner, said this week. The remains of three humans, in fact, were found behind McCuaig\u2019s Bar in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. And though police were called, it was not, as it turned out, a crime scene.",
        "CARTAGENA, Colombia \u2014 Everywhere she goes, Ana Guardo Acevedo, 17 and seven months pregnant, has a worried look on her face and a folder full of medical tests in her hands. Three months ago, when her baby bump was still barely noticeable, the rims of Ana\u2019s eyes turned red and a rash crept across her stomach, down her arms, over her face. Doctors in the emergency room first suspected chickenpox but then told her she was infected with a virus she had never heard of before, Zika. And, suddenly Zika was everywhere.",
        "SULAYMANIYAH, Iraq \u2014 Syrian Kurds unilaterally declared the creation of a federal region in northeastern Syria on Thursday, raising fears of an accelerating disintegration of Syria along ethnic and sectarian lines and complicating efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Syrian crisis. The declaration defied warnings from Turkey, the United States and the Syrian government that any such move risks further destabilizing the already country, could trigger new conflicts and would not win international support. It came at the end of a meeting in the northeastern Syrian town of Rmeilan organized by the main U. S.",
        "On the evening of Aug. 20, 1980, four youths went running in Liberty Park, a grassy expanse at the heart of Salt Lake City. After a while, Terry Elrod and her close friend Karma Ingersoll fell behind their two older male friends, Ted Fields and David Martin. That\u2019s when the two boys jumped out from some bushes to scare the girls. It was around 10:15 p. m. by the time the four friends left the park. But as they crossed an intersection, gunshots suddenly cracked over the quiet park. Martin stumbled on one leg and fell.",
        "On Thursday morning, John F. Kerry issued a statement that said the Islamic State militant group had committed atrocities against minority groups in Iraq and Syria that constitute genocide. The U. S. secretary of state\u2019s comments marked the first such U. S. declaration since 2004, when of State Colin Powell said the killings taking place in Sudan\u2019s Darfur region amounted to genocide. The concept of genocide carries a lot of weight in international law. The 1948 U. N. convention on genocide requires signatories to work to prevent genocide and punish perpetrators when it does occur.",
        "Having entered the school\u2019s first NCAA tournament since 1962 amid campus discord over their expelled captain, the Yale Bulldogs stunned Baylor with a comprehensive, upset victory at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts Center in Providence, R.

        "Memory loss is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s and heartbreaking for loved ones to watch progress. Gone are the details of a first love or a child\u2019s wobbly first steps. The achievements of a distinguished career. And the tall tales of traveling the globe that once had everyone rolling on the floor with laughter. Scientists had assumed for a long time that the disease destroys how those memories are encoded and makes them disappear forever. But what if they weren\u2019t actually gone \u2014 just inaccessible?",
        "CAIRO \u2014 The most famous tomb in the world may have been shared, a discovery that could unlock one of the world\u2019s greatest mysteries: What happened to a beautiful queen who once ruled ancient Egypt? On Thursday, Egypt\u2019s minister of antiquities announced that radar scans of King Tut\u2019s tomb have potentially uncovered two new chambers inside the pharaoh\u2019s mausoleum. The scans, added Mamdouh revealed metal and organic masses that suggest there are funeral objects inside the rooms. \u201dIt could be the discovery of the century,\u201d Damaty told reporters.",
        "Adam LaRoche had considered the idea of retiring for his children before this week, when he actually did it, when he walked away from $13 million because the Chicago White Sox placed restrictions on how often his son, Drake, could come to their clubhouse. When LaRoche with the Washington Nationals in 2013, when he was 32 and still at the end of his prime, Drake and his daughter, Montana, asked him to stay home.",

(Jose ) Maintaining, repairing and restoring aging religious statuary is a art practiced by a dwindling number of artisans in the small, densely populated country of El Salvador. In Apastepeque, a town of about 10, 000, Jose Sabas Gomez owns a workshop dedicated to religious statue repair. Gomez says that this finely detailed work, involving carving, painting and patching wood and sculpting and shaping plaster and stone, is no longer a popular choice as a profession.

Four other people were also arrested, three of them members of Abdeslam\u2019s family, as police carried out three raids over a operation, a spokesman for the Belgian federal prosecutor\u2019s office said.

        "BERLIN \u2014 The European Union and the Turkish government reached accord Friday on how to contain Europe\u2019s largest migrant crisis since World War II, agreeing to a deal that turns Turkey into the region\u2019s refugee camp and leaves untold thousands stranded in a country with a deteriorating record on human rights. After a day and half of wrangling, European leaders and Turkey hashed out the specifics of a broad agreement announced last week that was the brainchild of the Turks and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.",
        "Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois on Friday became the first Republican senator to call for an vote on Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, saying on a Chicago radio show that his colleagues ought to \u201cjust man up and cast a vote. \u201d That Kirk would be first to break with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) and other GOP colleagues, who believe the next president should pick the replacement for Justice Antonin Scalia, is not particularly surprising: Kirk was already one of two Republican senators, with Susan Collins of Maine, to call for hearings.",
        "As I sat in the Crown Coliseum in Fayetteville, N. C. earlier this month, waiting for Donald Trump\u2019s rally to start, my adrenaline began to rush. I knew I could be hurt for what I was about to do. I\u2019d driven three hours by myself that morning from college in southern Virginia to protest his campaign. For months, I\u2019d been reading and watching coverage of Trump\u2019s rise. His rallies had become spaces where people felt comfortable being openly racist and hateful, because he allowed them to.",
        "While Gov. John Kasich ( ) headed to the second of three town halls in Utah, Mitt Romney announced that he\u2019d be voting for Sen.

I like Governor John Kasich. I have campaigned with him.",
        "It\u2019s happened before. The Republican establishment, recognizing the danger that the bigoted, demagogic candidate posed to the party, roundly opposed his election. On Election Day, however, the candidate captured a majority of the white vote. It was no fluke, as his odious views were well known. He had even once held elected office. A column I wrote almost 25 years ago refreshed my memory.",
        "The Republican Party\u2019s incoherent response to the Supreme Court vacancy is a partisan reflex in search of a justifying principle. The multiplicity of Republican rationalizations for their refusal to even consider Merrick B. Garland radiates insincerity. Republicans instantly responded to Antonin Scalia\u2019s death by proclaiming that no nominee, however admirable in temperament, intellect and experience, would be accorded a hearing. They say their obduracy is right: Because they have a right to be obdurate, there being no explicit constitutional proscription against this.",

        "Chris W. Cox is executive director of the National Rifle Association s Institute for Legislative Action. Last month, Second Amendment advocates and other patriotic Americans were shocked by the news of the sudden passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. His death was a tragedy for our Constitution and our country. For supporters of the Second Amendment, his death could result in the end of individual gun ownership in the United States. In 2008, the Supreme Court answered the question of whether individual citizens have a right to own a firearm in their homes for .",
        "Mark and Jackie Barden are plaintiffs in the case Soto et. al v. Bushmaster. Our son, our sweet little Daniel, was just 7 when he was murdered in his classroom at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 14, 2012. We are among the 10 families suing the manufacturer, distributor and retail seller of the assault rifle that took 26 lives in less than five minutes on that terrible day. We write in response to Sen.

Some 900, 000 suspensions were in effect last year. That means roughly a sixth of the commonwealth\u2019s motorists have lost their driving privileges because they were unwilling or, perhaps more frequently, unable to pay fines and fees. The fines and fees may be levied for serious crimes, but in many cases they are not.",
        "The Virginia man who was taken into custody in Iraq after he purportedly deserted the Islamic State told a Kurdish TV station Thursday that he decided to escape after he grew dissatisfied during intensive religious training in Mosul. Mohamad Khweis told Kurdistan 24 that his life under the Islamic State in Mosul was a \u201cvery strict\u201d regimen of prayer, eating and eight hours of daily instruction in religion and sharia law. He said he soon came to realize that \u201cI didn\u2019t really support their ideology.",
        "Hell might actually be other people at least if you\u2019re really smart. That\u2019s the implication of fascinating new research published last month in the British Journal of Psychology. Evolutionary psychologists Satoshi Kanazawa of the London School of Economics and Norman Li of Singapore Management University dig in to the question of what makes a life . While traditionally the domain of priests, philosophers and novelists, in recent years survey researchers, economists, biologists and scientists have been tackling that question. Kanazawa and Li theorize that the lifestyles of our ancient ancestors form the foundation for what make us happy now.",
        "A congressman, a and a Las Vegas superstar tried to conjure a legislative spell in Washington this week. In a deft sleight of hand, Rep. Pete Sessions ( .) slipped a rather unusual bill before his congressional colleagues: a formal resolution \u201crecognizing magic as a rare and valuable art form and national treasure. \u201d Whereas magic is an art form with the unique power and potential to impact the lives of all people . . .

        "The appropriate reaction included a hanging jaw, a rubbing of the eyes, a checking of the fitness of your television screen. Michigan State lost. Michigan State lost? Michigan State lost. If the first five months of the college basketball had convinced you anything is possible this year, the 21st and most inconceivable game of the NCAA tournament must have. Michigan State, more reliable in March than John McClane on Christmas, never even led against Middle Tennessee State in a shocking, loss Friday afternoon in St. Louis. The Spartans became the eighth No.",
