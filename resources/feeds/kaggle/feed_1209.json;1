        "SOMETIMES \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d is like a Magic that can seem to hold all the answers. Peer deeply enough into the long odyssey of Homer, say, and a certain warped wisdom can float to the surface. One example resurfaced early this year, when it was remembered that David Bowie and Alan Rickman, who died within days of each other in January, were both referenced in one scene in a 2013 \u201cSimpsons\u201d episode. And now we have a new example: Exactly 16 years ago tomorrow, in an episode titled \u201cBart to the Future,\u201d the show predicted a Donald Trump presidency.",
        "It\u2019s hatched! A baby bald eagle was born at 8:27 a. m. Eastern time Friday at the National Arboretum in Northeast Washington. The American Eagle Foundation said \u201cit is confirmed the eaglet is out and alive. \u201d A second eaglet is likely to hatch over the weekend. The Bald Eagle Nest Cam can be seen at eagles. org or dceaglecam. org. Around lunchtime Friday, the District\u2019s wildlife biologist Dan Rauch said it looked like the eaglet was strong and was \u201cbeing fed already. \u201d \u201cAll signs are very encouraging,\u201d he said.",
        "Researchers looking into mortality trends and autism have made a troubling discovery: People on the autism spectrum are dying young \u2014 some 12 to 30 years earlier than might otherwise be expected. The analysis, conducted by Sweden\u2019s Karolinska Institute and published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, found that the leading cause of premature death in autistic adults isn\u2019t due to diseases, such as heart ailments or cancer, that are the main killers in the general population. It\u2019s suicide. The data, which includes information on 27, 000 people with the disorder and about 2.",
        "We can all agree that commercial flying is often a horribly unpleasant experience. From the groping at the security checkpoint to the inhumane delays to the sheer weirdness of screaming across the sky in a tightly packed aluminum tube at 30, 000 feet, there\u2019s little to recommend the experience beyond getting to your destination much more quickly than by car. One of the reasons flying can be so terrible is that airlines are cramming passengers into ever smaller spaces to wring the most profit out of each flight.",
        "Great white, False Bay, August 2013. (Michael by CPi Syndication) You\u2019ve seen sharks depicted in photos charging forward, two glinting rows of daggers exposed by a snarl, ready to sink into your flesh. But you probably haven\u2019t seen a shark, mouth agape and draped in total relaxation over a diver\u2019s arm. This phenomenon is called tonic immobility. Stroking the shark\u2019s nose sends the animal into a catatonic state, enabling researchers to tag, perform minor surgeries, and remove hooks. Some believe it works because the nose is loaded with electroreceptors and overloads their senses.",
        "A prospective general election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton could significantly alter which states are in play this fall and heighten more than in any recent election the racial, class and gender divisions within the national electorate. After successive campaigns in which President Obama expanded the Democrats\u2019 electoral map options by focusing on and increasingly diverse states, a 2016 race between Clinton and Trump could devolve principally into a pitched battle for the Rust Belt.",
        "Donald Trump will host a group of nearly two dozen top Republicans on Monday afternoon for an gathering that his allies hope will improve his relationship with the congressional GOP and the party\u2019s Washington establishment, according to two attendees. The meeting is Trump\u2019s first major meeting with lawmakers and key Republican figures since last fall, when he met with a smaller group at the Capitol after his speech at a protest against the Iranian nuclear agreement.",
        "The U. S. military has stepped up investigations of officers for sexual assault, records show, curtailing its traditional deference toward senior leaders as it cracks down on sex crimes. Since September, the armed forces have or filed charges against four colonels from the Air Force, Army and Marines. In addition, a Navy captain was found guilty of abusive sexual contact during an administrative hearing. Historically, it has been extremely rare for senior military officers to face .",
        "ALEPPO, Syria \u2014 Five years of conflict have torn Syria apart. And nowhere is that more stark than in its most populous city, Aleppo, where front lines carve through neighborhoods and slice it in two. It is a city of sharply contrasting halves, and one side clearly appears to have the upper hand. In a park on the side, families picnic while children line up to buy balloons and popcorn. A few miles away, on a sprawling university campus, thousands of students attend class. Downtown, the city\u2019s cinema plays the latest Hollywood films. In the evenings, the restaurants fill.",
        "Vernell Garvin wasn\u2019t surprised that President Barack Obama tapped Merrick Garland to sit on the U. S. Supreme Court. She already knew the judge was among the smartest people in the country. Garland is, after all, really good at algebra. He\u2019s even pretty strong at language arts. \u201cWhen I have problems with my math homework, he\u2019ll help me with that,\u201d said Vernell, a fifth grader at J. O.

        "On Oct. 24, 1968 at Manhattan\u2019s Madison Square Garden, in the very heartland of the \u201cintellectual morons,\u201d as the presidential candidate George Wallace was given to say, Wallace told a cheering overflow crowd of 20, 000 about a protester who had laid down in front of Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s limousine. His take was this: \u201cWhen November comes, the first time they lie down in front of my limousine, it\u2019ll be the last one they ever lay down in front of. \u201d Protesters shouted in the arena.",
        "Why would anyone vote for Donald Trump? One popular theory holds that his supporters are bigots angered by America\u2019s changing racial mix. Another is that they\u2019re working folks left behind by the loss of manufacturing jobs, alienated from the moneyed ruling class and irritated by the tyranny of political correctness. Or some combination thereof. These theories, which contain elements of truth, emphasize Trump\u2019s dire assessment of America and his followers\u2019 discontent. They focus on negative sentiment.",
        "In 2015, the United States spent $7. 5 billion, more than of its global health budget, to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. These, after all, are the \u201cbig three\u201d infectious diseases, and they\u2019ve ravaged populations. AIDS has killed more than 25 million people worldwide since 2000; in 2015, there were 214 million cases of malaria and almost 10 million tuberculosis diagnoses. But thanks to an unlikely coalition \u2014 including George W. Bush, Bill Gates and Bono \u2014 the tide is turning. AIDS deaths peaked at 2 million in 2004 and have dropped 42 percent worldwide since.",
        "Once, alone and a little lost in the London subway, I said thank you when a nice guy helped me figure out where to go. In response, he leaned in to hug me, held me close for a few stunned seconds, slid his hands down and squeezed. In my imagination, this is the part when I say something sharp enough to remind him that this is not his dance space. In my imagination, it comes out without a waver or a hint of a smile.",
        "The left and the right don\u2019t agree on much today. But it\u2019s easy to find a consensus that an excess of spin is ruining politics. Spin \u2014 the deliberate crafting of words and images for political effect \u2014 is everywhere, from the scripted laugh lines that candidates trot out in debates, to the artful circumlocutions of press secretaries, to the slick ads and viral videos that flicker across our screens. Don\u2019t get spun, even about spin. Some of the conventional wisdom about the practice is false or exaggerated.",
        "IRBIL, Iraq \u2014 A U. S. Marine was killed near the front line with the Islamic State in northern Iraq on Saturday, becoming the second combat casualty of the war against the militants, according to the U. S. military and Iraqi officials. The Marine died when Islamic State militants fired rockets into a small U. S. base in Makhmour, a town controlled by Kurdish peshmerga forces on the outskirts of the region of Kurdistan, U. S. officials said. \u201cSeveral\u201d other Marines also were injured in the rocket attack, according to a Pentagon statement.",
        "BEIRUT \u2014 A suicide bombing at a popular shopping area in Istanbul that killed at least five people, including two Americans, and wounded dozens more Saturday may be tied to the Islamic State, according to media reports. The blast targeted Istiklal Street, a major thoroughfare lined with international shopping outlets and restaurants that bustles with foreign tourists on weekends. Five people had been confirmed dead and at least 36 wounded, including 12 foreign nationals, the Hurriyet Daily News reported, citing comments from Turkish Health Minister Mehmet Muezzinoglu.",
        "Spring arrived early in many parts of the United States this year, making it easy to forget that we\u2019re still in the final days of winter. On Sunday, however, we can really say spring has begun with the arrival of the vernal (or spring) equinox, which occurs March 20 at 12:30 a. m. Eastern time. On the equinox, neither of Earth\u2019s hemispheres tilts away from or toward the sun, and there are nearly equal amounts of daylight and darkness across the globe.",
        "President Obama\u2019s arrival in Cuba on Sunday will provide the most vivid manifestation yet of the foreign policy he has championed since taking office more than seven years ago: a world in which the United States sets aside historic feuds to broker a more stable global order. But after he leaves Tuesday afternoon, island residents will still be coping with many of the same problems that they have faced for decades: a faltering economy; a strict, political system with little tolerance for dissent; and emigration of talented professionals.",
        "Children drinking from water fountains at the nation\u2019s schools \u2014 especially in aging facilities with lead pipes and fixtures \u2014 might be unwittingly exposing themselves to high levels of lead, which is known to cause brain damage and developmental problems including impulsive behavior, poor language skills and trouble remembering new information. Under federal law, the vast majority of schools don\u2019t have to test the water flowing out of their taps and drinking fountains, and many states and districts also do not mandate water testing at schools.",
        "BRUSSELS \u2014 It was likely to be yet another fruitless raid, the latest chapter in the agonizing search for the terrorists who planned the attacks on Paris in November, the deadliest in Europe since the Madrid bombings of 2004. But it was anything but routine on Tuesday when Belgian and French police stormed into an apartment in Brussels\u2019s quiet Forest neighborhood, a suspected terrorist safe house. The apartment was not empty, as police had suspected it would be after records showed its basic utilities had been shut off for days.",
        "Bob Zwolinski tweeted a gruesome picture of his face earlier this month. He was bloodied and bruised \u2014 with a staple visible on his forehead. \u201cPolitics is a contact sport,\u201d wrote Zwolinski, who was running for a state House seat in Illinois. \u201cApparently that\u2019s literally the case. \u201d Zwolinski told The Post on Friday that he was attacked when a verbal confrontation outside his campaign offices escalated to violence. The left side of his face was \u201cswollen like a balloon,\u201d he said, and he needed stitches and a tetanus shot after the beating, he said.",
        "On Saturday morning, one day after thousands of people gleefully watched a baby eagle hatch on live video, the bird\u2019s sibling began to emerge from its own shell at the National Arboretum. Watchers confirmed the first signs of a crack (known as a \u201cpip\u201d among the pros) just after 9 a. m. said Daniel Rauch, a wildlife biologist at the District\u2019s Department of Energy and Environment. The full hatching process, he said, may take an additional 24 to 36 hours. Experts didn\u2019t expect this activity from baby eagle No. 2 until at least Sunday, Rauch said.",

        "BRUSSELS \u2014 Belgium\u2019s foreign minister, Didier Reynders, said Sunday that terror suspect Salah Abdeslam, who was wanted in the terror attacks that shook Paris in November, was planning more attacks while he was hiding in Brussels. Until police found him Friday in the Molenbeek neighborhood in Brussels, he had been organizing a new \u201cnetwork of people\u201d to launch assaults in European countries, Reynders said.

The court will consider whether Republican lawmakers packed African American voters into Democratic Rep. Robert C. \u201cBobby\u201d Scott\u2019s district to comply with the Voting Rights Act or to make surrounding districts more hospitable to white candidates. A lower court ruled against the legislature last year, and the judges then created a second district designed for a black candidate."
