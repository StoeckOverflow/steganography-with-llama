        "We\u2019ve said it before, and we\u2019ll say it again: President Obama\u2019s pick for the Supreme Court is very unlikely to get a hearing, much less to be confirmed, by the Senate this year. But a few Republican senators have indicated they\u2019d be willing to at least meet with Judge Merrick Garland and one, Sen. Mark Kirk (Ill.) has said he thinks Garland should get a vote. (Maine Sen. Susan Collins has called for a hearing.) There\u2019s a possibility, however remote, that more GOP senators could split with their party and endorse Garland\u2019s consideration.",
        "HAVANA \u2014 President Obama arrived in Cuba on Sunday afternoon, a journey of only 90 miles from U. S. shores that took more than half a century to complete. Stepping off Air Force One under drizzling skies, the president held an umbrella over his wife, Michelle, as he was greeted by senior Cuban officials. The Obamas, including the president\u2019s two daughters and his were met on the tarmac by Bruno Rodr\u00edguez, Cuba\u2019s foreign minister, and Josefina Vidal, the head of the U. S. section of Cuba\u2019s Foreign Ministry, as well as Jeffrey DeLaurentis, the senior U. S.",
        "TUCSON \u2014 Donald Trump on Sunday doubled down on his team\u2019s insistence that campaign manager Corey Lewandowski behaved appropriately while forcefully engaging with a protester at a rally here in Tucson on Saturday afternoon, commenting that local police and security appeared \u201ca little lax\u201d at the event. Video footage shows Lewandowski and a man \u2014 who appears to be a plainclothes member of Trump\u2019s security team \u2014 heatedly speaking to a protester. In a few seconds, the young man is suddenly pulled back by the collar. The protester then begins shoving the man to Lewandowski\u2019s left.",
        "When President Obama chose to sidestep military action in Syria in 2013 and then struck a deal to dispose of most of the regime\u2019s chemical weapons, it seemed possible to me that he had stumbled into a tactical victory. After all, the proposed airstrikes, which Secretary of State John F. Kerry promised would be \u201cunbelievably small,\u201d didn\u2019t appear likely to achieve much, while the neutralization of the chemical arsenal would remove a major threat to the region. I changed my mind after I heard from dozens of foreign ministers and other senior officials of U. S.",
        "Douglas Laycock is a law professor at the University of Virginia. Zubik v. Burwell is the Supreme Court\u2019s name for the set of cases more often identified with the Little Sisters of the Poor, a religious order that is also a party to the case. I filed an amicus brief in Zubik on behalf of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty. I had never before filed a brief in support of the government in a case about the free exercise of religion. The facts in this case, which will be argued Wednesday, are complicated.",
        "There\u2019s a reason beyond partisanship that Senate Republicans resist even holding hearings on President Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. Their gambit evades a full and open debate over the conservative judicial agenda, which is to use the high court in an aggressive and political way to reverse decades of progressive legislation. The central irony here: The very conservatives who use \u201cjudicial activism\u201d as a battering ram against liberals are now the aggressive judicial activists.",
        "In this bitter campaign, one area of agreement unites the major candidates: trade. Bernie Sanders brags that he\u2019s opposed all recent trade agreements; Hillary Clinton now rejects the Partnership (TPP) President Obama\u2019s signature trade success that she once supported; and Donald Trump blames incompetent U. S. trade negotiators for devastating job losses to China that might be cured by a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports. You should take all this with a boulder of salt. Robert J. Samuelson writes a weekly column on economics.",
        "Like Sen. Lindsey Graham ( . C.) Mitt Romney does his party and the country a service by a stance on Donald Trump: This week, in the Utah nominating caucus, I will vote for Senator Ted Cruz. Today, there is a contest between Trumpism and Republicanism. Through the calculated statements of its leader, Trumpism has become associated with racism, misogyny, bigotry, xenophobia, vulgarity and, most recently, threats and violence. I am repulsed by each and every one of these. The only path that remains to nominate a Republican rather than Mr. Trump is to have an open convention.",
        "THE HOUSE Oversight and Government Reform Committee met last week to witness one of the most common of Washington exercises: . Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) testified that \u201ccareer bureaucrats\u201d were responsible for the disastrous lead poisoning in Flint\u2019s tap water, and he placed another heap of blame on the federal Environmental Protection Agency for failing to act sooner. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy shot back that the state created the problem and dragged its feet when the EPA started to ask questions. In fact, government at every level bears some responsibility. The state is most to blame. As Ms.",
        "Democratic Hillary Clinton and her allies have begun preparing a playbook to defeat Donald Trump in a matchup that will attempt to do what his Republican opponents couldn\u2019t: show that his business dealings and impolitic statements make him unfit to be commander in chief. Both the Clinton campaign and outside supporters are confident that she and Trump will almost certainly face each other in the general election and that the focus is shifting past her primary campaign against Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.",
        "This post has been updated. In the last weeks of his flagging presidential bid, former Florida governor Jeb Bush loaned or gave his campaign nearly $407, 000 as it struggled to pay its bills. New Federal Election Commission filings show that Bush\u2019s campaign spent $3. 6 million last month before he dropped out Feb. 20 \u2014 raising just $1. 18 million in the same period. A large share of the money came from the candidate himself, who gave his campaign $56, 983. 50 on Feb. 1. The next day, he loaned the campaign $250, 000. And on Feb.",
        "BEIRUT \u2014 Authorities in Turkey on Sunday named a Turkish man with alleged ties to the Islamic State as responsible for the weekend suicide bombing in Istanbul that killed four foreign tourists and deepened fears of rising instability in the country. The attack on Saturday on Istiklal Avenue, a major thoroughfare that is one of Istanbul\u2019s biggest draws for tourists and locals alike, underscored the extent to which Turkey is confronting an accelerating threat from extremists on two fronts.",
        "p. series b. series img. series About this series: What\u2019s happening in America? What does it mean to be an American? These are questions defining a campaign unlike any other. For nearly 35 days, we crossed the nation looking for answers. This is what we found. PART 1 | PART 2 | PART 3 | PART 4 Where else to pick up but in Las Vegas, our nation\u2019s great national cliche, more excessive in its hyperbole than the boasts in a Donald Trump stump speech, at once the representation and perversion of the American Dream.",
        "A University of Kansas professor will get to keep her job after using a racial slur in class last fall, upsetting a group of graduate students, who said she has a history of discriminatory behavior and needs to be fired. After a investigation, the university\u2019s Office of Institutional Opportunity and Access notified Andrea Quenette on Friday that her actions did not violate the school\u2019s nondiscrimination and racial and ethnic harassment policies, according to the Lawrence . Quenette, an assistant professor of communication studies, had been on paid leave since Nov.",
        "BERLIN \u2014 A contentious deal struck Friday between the European Union and Turkey aims to finally halt the historic wave of irregular migration to Europe from the Middle East and beyond. But Germany, ground zero of the refu gee crisis, faces a separate problem \u2014 what to do about all those who are already here. The rapid rate of arrivals in the nation has forced a backlog of 770, 000 asylum requests. About half of them, authorities say, will be rejected. That means figuring out how to get the asylum seekers who cannot stay to leave.",
        "With a flurry of letters to a variety of federal agencies, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has launched a broad investigation into the federal workforce. The letters, sent over the past few weeks by Rep. Jason Chaffetz ( ) contain no accusations of wrongdoing but are heavy with implication. One set of letters to more than two dozen agencies requests the names of individual employees who are allowed to do work on government time.",
        "BRIGHTON, Mich. \u2014 Melissa Gilbert is being a bit flippant. In her latest role, that of a Democratic candidate for the U. S. House from central Michigan, the veteran TV actress has filled her campaign coffers with fat checks from a nearly bottomless list of celebrity friends. You can just imagine the attack ad her opponent, Republican Rep. Mike Bishop, could launch: This carpetbagging dilettante and the liberal Hollywood elite want to buy your wholesome Midwestern seat in Congress.",

        "HAVANA \u2014 In an extraordinary news conference Monday afternoon, President Obama and Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro sparred over human rights, Guantanamo and their starkly different views of their own countries and the world, even as both hailed Obama\u2019s historic visit here as a successful new step in normalizing relations. The event was at times a jarring juxtaposition of diplomatic formality and public jousting, as questions from American reporters sparked abrupt reactions from Castro, who either ignored them or dismissed them as misguided. At one point, he challenged a U. S.",
        "HAVANA \u2014 In the coming months, when American hotel executives arrive to take over management of Havana\u2019s landmark Hotel Inglaterra, chef Jorge Luis Bormey will become one of the first Cubans to work for a U. S. company in nearly 60 years. \u201cI\u2019m excited,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re pioneers. \u201d The Inglaterra, where Bormey has spent 15 years frying bananas and stirring pots of black beans, is one of the three properties the Starwood Hotels and Resorts chain will operate in a trailblazing arrangement that blows the biggest hole yet in the U. S. trade embargo first imposed in 1960.",
        "This post has been updated. Donald Trump outlined an unabashedly noninterventionist approach to world affairs Monday, telling The Washington Post\u2019s editorial board that he questions the need for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which has formed the backbone of Western security policies since the Cold War. The meeting at The Post covered a range of issues, including media libel laws, violence at his rallies, climate change, NATO and the U. S. presence in Asia.",
        "On the campaign trail, Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy smacks of bluster and bellicosity. He is, as he often says, ready to \u201cknock the hell out of ISIS. \u201d But that kind of rhetoric appears to mask a far different philosophy, that of an politician whose views represent a dramatic break with years of Republican Party orthodoxy.",
        "San Bernardino, Calif. \u2014 The FBI may have found a way without Apple\u2019s assistance to unlock the iPhone used by one of the shooters in the San Bernardino terrorist attack, Justice Department officials said Monday. Less than 24 hours before a hearing over access to the phone was set to begin, DOJ lawyers requested a delay. A federal judge agreed to postpone the oral arguments. In a terse application, the U. S. attorney in Los Angeles, Eileen Decker, said that on Sunday \u201can outside party demonstrated to the FBI a possible method for unlocking [the shooter\u2019s] iPhone.",
        "FREDERICK RYAN JR. WASHINGTON POST PUBLISHER: Mr. Trump, welcome to the Washington Post. Thank you for making time to meet with our editorial board. DONALD TRUMP: New building. Yes this is very nice. Good luck with it. RYAN: Thank you \u2026 We\u2019ve heard you\u2019re going to be announcing your foreign policy team shortly \u2026 Any you can share with us?",
        "AS DONALD Trump observed during a visit to The Post on Monday, we have been critical of his candidacy, so give him credit for agreeing to sit down with us and answer questions for more than an hour. Unfortunately, the visit provided no reassurance regarding Mr. Trump\u2019s fitness for the presidency. \u201cI\u2019m not a radical person,\u201d he told us as he was leaving. But his answers left little doubt how radical a risk the nation would be taking in entrusting the White House to him. There was, first, a breezy willingness to ignore facts and evidence.",
        "One of the oddest documents in a very odd political year is the transcript of an interview conducted by NPR last week with Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R). He had previously endorsed Mike Huckabee for the Republican presidential nomination and later Marco Rubio, and now he was \u201cwithout a candidate\u201d and, it seems, without much in the way of political integrity, either. He did not rule out endorsing Donald Trump. Hutchinson set out his priorities.",
        "In a time of brushfire populism, the problem is not the populace; it is the populists who seek to lead it. The two candidates who call themselves revolutionaries \u2014 Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump \u2014 are, in fact, backward looking, intellectually timid and unresponsive to the real needs of the working and middle classes. This judgment emerges from some basic economics (bear with me). The past several decades have seen both dramatic increases in productivity and the fading of the traditional, American, dream.",
        "The historic visit of a sitting U. S. president to Havana \u2014 which should have come a sooner \u2014 will almost surely hasten the day when Cubans are free from the Castro government\u2019s suffocating repression. President Obama\u2019s whirlwind trip is the culmination of his revamping of U. S. policy toward Cuba. One outdated, counterproductive relic of the Cold War remains \u2014 the economic embargo forbidding most business ties with the island nation \u2014 and the Congress won\u2019t even consider repealing it.",

        "MOSCOW \u2014 Russia warned on Monday that it was prepared to act unilaterally in Syria against groups that it said were breaking the there, injecting a volatile new element into a conflict that has been calmer in recent weeks. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said the country\u2019s military was ready to strike as early as Tuesday against groups that it said were violating the unless U.
