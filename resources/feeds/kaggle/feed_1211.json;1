        "Federal prosecutors are declining to prosecute a former U. S. diplomat who was investigated by the FBI on suspicion of providing secrets to the Pakistani government, according to U. S. law enforcement officials. The diplomat, Robin L. Raphel, was at the center of a counterintelligence investigation, which became public after agents raided her Washington home in 2014. FBI agents found classified information in the search, but the information was years old, according to a former U. S. law enforcement official familiar with the investigation. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter.",
        "Everything old is new again when it comes to the iPhone line. With the announcement of a new iPhone, called the iPhone SE, Apple has brought back the screen size that users bid farewell to a couple of years ago. I had a few moments with the phone at Apple\u2019s launch event in Cupertino, Calif. and got to myself with the smaller screen. If I had to sum up the iPhone SE in one sentence it would be this: This is an iPhone 6S in the body of an iPhone 5S.",
        "Since Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, polls have established that a majority of Americans think the Senate should at least consider President Obama\u2019s nominee to fill the vacancy. But in politics, understanding what people support is often less important than understanding what they\u2019ll actually vote on. And a new poll from Gallup suggests Americans and especially independents aren\u2019t yet demanding that the Senate confirm Merrick Garland. Gallup is the first major national telephone poll to survey Americans\u2019 opinions on whether the Senate should confirm Garland to the Supreme Court.",
        "On its face, it was just a salacious tabloid story about a fading celebrity, a feisty gossip site and a murky sex tape. But former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan\u2019s $115 million legal body slam Friday against Gawker Media could have deeper implications for the debate between the public\u2019s right to know (and the media\u2019s right to report) and an individual\u2019s right to privacy. The verdict, say legal experts, suggests that pendulum has swung strongly toward the latter and away from the former in the Internet age. Hogan (a. k. a.",
        "The unintended consequences in a fight for religious liberty in Georgia keep adding up. The latest? It could cost Atlanta a Super Bowl bid.

        "BRUSSELS \u2014 Islamic State suicide bombers brought terror, chaos and bloodshed to the city at the heart of European unity on Tuesday, detonating their bombs at an airport departures hall and on a subway train in attacks that left at least 31 people dead and prompted authorities to launch an intensive manhunt for at least one accomplice who remains at large. The killings add this city to an ignominious but growing list of European capitals that have been struck in the past year by deadly attacks either perpetrated or inspired by the Islamic State, including Paris and Copenhagen.",
        "BRUSSELS \u2014 In this city often called \u201cthe capital of Europe,\u201d the main departure hall at Brussels Airport was a typical hive of activity Tuesday morning. A babble of languages filled the hall, as passengers milled at counters. There was a line for steaming java at Starbucks. Didier Marchal, 42, a former Belgian commando happy to be home after attending a wedding in Canada, had just gone through customs shortly after 8 a. m. Then, he heard it. \u201cThe sound was devastating,\u201d he recalled.",
        "Brussels was hit by a number of deadly explosions on Tuesday, with all signs pointing toward a coordinated terror attack. It\u2019s a shocking turn of events, but for anyone closely observing the city over the past few years, it wasn\u2019t exactly a surprise: While the Belgian capital had once been known best as a center for European culture and politics, its reputation had been tainted recently because of links to extremism and terror plots. Those links were hammered home just last week, when Belgian authorities finally captured terrorism suspect Salah Abdeslam in Brussels\u2019s predominantly Muslim Molenbeek quarter.",
        "The terror attacks in Brussels on Tuesday pose the worst kind of foreign policy dilemma for President Obama, pitting his instincts that he\u2019s doing all he can to defeat the Islamic State against intense political pressure for him to do more. Obama has been making the case for months that his strategy to defeat the Islamic State and protect Americans at home is slowly working. White House aides speak repeatedly of the 40 percent of the Islamic State\u2019s territory taken back from the group in Iraq and the 20 percent wrested away in Syria.",
        "This post has been updated Sen. Ted Cruz said in the wake of Tuesday\u2019s terrorist attacks in Brussels that law enforcement should closely guard Muslim neighborhoods, prompting swift criticism. \u201dWe need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized,\u201d Cruz said in a statement issued after the attacks, which killed at least 32 people and wounded dozens. Cruz spokeswoman Alice Stewart later said there needs to be a robust law enforcement presence in American neighborhoods where many Muslims live. \u201dWe know what is happening with these isolated Muslim neighborhoods in Europe.",

        "The value of catastrophic events is that they can help people face up to problems that are otherwise impossible to address. Maybe this will be the case with Tuesday\u2019s horrific attacks in Brussels. Europe is facing a security threat that\u2019s unprecedented in its modern history, at a time when its common currency, border security and are all under severe stress. If Europe were a stock, a pragmatic investor would sell it, despite the sunk cost and sentimental attachment. Without radical restructuring, it\u2019s an enterprise headed for failure.",
        "THE TERRORIST assault on Brussels Tuesday, just four days after the arrest of an architect of last year\u2019s attacks in Paris, underlined the resilience and continued menace of the Islamic State \u2014 to Europe, to the United States and to vital Western interests. It also revealed a crucial divide among U. S. presidential candidates about what this country must do to protect itself.",
        "Now that Donald Trump has spoken before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) a lobbying group, Americans have learned the following: Trump can read a teleprompter; he finally got someone to write him a decent speech, which he was able to deliver without resorting to vulgarities; and he has provided something like a justification for reluctant Republicans to support him.

Cut off though I was, I felt surrounded by friends. Upon hearing my accent, shop assistants and taxi drivers asked after my parents: Had I spoken to them yet? Could they help?

        "North Carolina lawmakers have called a special session of the state legislature for Wednesday to block a Charlotte ordinance supported by gay and transgender groups.

It prohibits businesses and city contractors, among others, from discriminating against these and other groups.

        "Rob Ford, the onetime populist mayor of Toronto whose agenda was overshadowed by a tempestuous personal life that made him an international butt of ridicule, as he made intemperate comments on racial and sexual matters and who, most notoriously, was caught on tape smoking crack cocaine, died March 22 at a Toronto hospital. He was 46. His family confirmed the death to news outlets. He had cancer, first diagnosed in 2014.

The visit to Argentina, coming on the heels of Obama\u2019s historic trip to Cuba, was initially aimed at highlighting its more U.
