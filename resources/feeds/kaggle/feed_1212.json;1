        "Establishment Republicans and their allies are rushing to build a multistate defense system to protect Senate and House candidates, fearing that the party could lose its hold on Congress if Donald Trump is at the top of the ticket in November. The anxiety about Trump\u2019s potential spillover effect on races was underscored Wednesday when House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin lamented the \u201cdisheartened\u201d state of the campaign and criticized the \u201cidentity politics\u201d on display in the increasingly toxic race for the GOP presidential nomination.",
        "PEWAUKEE, Wis. \u2014 Tonight, when Sen. Ted Cruz ( .) kicks off his campaign for Wisconsin\u2019s April 5 presidential primary, he will head to conservative Waukesha County and talk with a conservative radio host. There\u2019s a reason for that. In a typical day here, in the suburbs of Milwaukee, Republicans can spin their radio dials and have their pick of Trump commentary. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with the orange or red face paint?\u201d asks WISN\u2019s Jay Weber. \u201cTrump\u2019s followers don\u2019t even monitor politics,\u201d says WISN\u2019s Vicki McKenna.",
        "As Republicans in Utah waited for their caucuses to start on Tuesday night, Republican Donald Trump \u2014 who had lagged in the state\u2019s polls and went on to lose Utah \u2014 tweeted an attack on his chief rival that got personal. \u201cWow Sen. Ted Cruz, that is some ad you did using a picture [of] Melania in a G. Q. shoot. Be careful or I will spill the beans on your wife,\u201d Trump tweeted 17 minutes before the Utah caucuses were scheduled to start. Within seconds, Trump deleted the tweet.",
        "In the wake of the deadly terror attacks in Brussels, Hillary Clinton laid out a stark contrast between her approach for dealing with the Islamic State threat and that of the two leading Republican presidential candidates, businessman Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz, in a speech at Stanford University on Wednesday. The Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s remarks were both a repudiation of Cruz ( .) and Trump, and an effort to further stake out a forceful foreign policy stance that addresses heightened American anxiety about security. \u201dAmerica does not cower in fear or hide behind walls.",
        "Michael Kinsley once said, \u201cA gaffe is when a politician tells the truth. \u201d I was reminded of that yesterday when I read that Bill Clinton recently told voters that they should support his wife, \u201cif you believe we\u2019ve finally come to the point where we can put the awful legacy of the last eight years behind us and the seven years before that.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: Donald Trump continued stomping towards the GOP nomination with a big win in Arizona last night, which will stir more anxiety among GOP elites who worry that his strategy of courting white backlash could drive away minority voters, helping unleash an electoral bloodbath up and down the ticket. Paul Ryan is set to give a speech today decrying the \u201ctone\u201d in our politics that will likely hint at criticism of Trump along these lines. But what if Trump\u2019s efforts to court white backlash constitute one of the essential ingredients of his success among Republican voters?",
        "In another maddeningly elliptical criticism of Republican Donald Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan ( .) argued for pursuing a noble vision of politics in a major speech on Wednesday. Yet his party does not seem to be much interested in substance and civility, and his fine sentiments cannot jolt the GOP into reason. That is in part because Ryan left out the most powerful words he could have spoken: \u201cI will not support Donald Trump, a man who embodies everything I am criticizing today, for president. \u201d Instead, Ryan kept his many criticisms of Trump implicit.",
        "As a rabbi of an Orthodox congregation in Washington, I am a strong supporter of Israel and of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which lobbies on its behalf here. For more than a decade, I\u2019ve traveled to Israel at least once a year, and I\u2019ve been to many AIPAC events over my 17 years as a rabbi. So when Donald Trump addressed the group\u2019s annual policy conference at the Verizon Center on Monday, I was sitting six rows away from the stage. And as Trump began his speech, I rose from my seat.",
        "A nauseating rhythm in the United States set into motion after the terrorist attacks in Brussels on Tuesday. Like clockwork, not long after the horror of the bombings gripped us all, President Obama was the focus of relentless criticism. Not only should he have not attended that baseball game, but he should also have cut short his historic to trip to Cuba to return to Washington. There are two reasons I won\u2019t clamber aboard that reactionary train. The terrorist attacks did not happen in the United States and the Obama backlash is aggravating in its inconsistency.",
        "The Supreme Court was divided during a tense oral argument Wednesday over whether religiously affiliated organizations such as universities, hospitals and charities should be exempt from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate that employees receive contraceptive coverage. The court\u2019s four liberals were supportive of the Obama administration\u2019s position that it has offered an acceptable accommodation for such organizations that respects their beliefs and ensures that women receive the coverage they are entitled to under the law.",
        "The USS Conestoga left the Navy yard at Mare Island. Calif. on Good Friday, 1921, bound for Pearl Harbor, with a complement of 56 sailors. It cleared the Golden Gate at 3:25 p. m. and steamed into the Gulf of the Farallones in heavy seas. Conestoga was a rugged oceangoing tug that had once hauled coal barges for a Pennsylvania railroad. But 17 years after its launch in Baltimore, it had seen hard use and had a reputation as a \u201cwet boat,\u201d one that shipped water easily. At 4 p. m.",
        "Joe Garagiola, who transformed a mediocre playing career in baseball into almost six decades as a popular and joyously broadcaster, becoming the sport\u2019s ambassador to the American public and a host of the \u201cToday\u201d show, died March 23 in Arizona. He was 90. His family announced the death but did not cite a cause. He had been in ill health since a stroke and heart attack in 2013. From 1946 to 1954, Mr. Garagiola was a catcher for the St. Louis Cardinals, Pittsburgh Pirates, Chicago Cubs and New York Giants. Statistically, his career was eminently forgettable.",
        "It\u2019s a fact that people of color are worse off than white Americans in all kinds of ways, but there is little agreement on why. Some see those disparities as a consequence of racial discrimination in schools, the courts and the workplace, both in the past and present. Others argue that economic inequalities are really the cause, and that public policy should help the poor no matter their race or ethnicity. When it comes to affirmative action in college admissions, for example, many say that children from poor, white families should receive preferential treatment, as well.",
        "A task force appointed by Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder to investigate the crisis in Flint issued a blistering report Wednesday, laying blame squarely on state officials in what it called \u201ca story of government failure, intransigence, unpreparedness, delay, inaction and environmental injustice. \u201d The report details a widespread lack of responsibility and leadership that contributed to the catastrophe, which potentially exposed more than 95, 000 residents in the beleaguered city \u2014 including some 9, 000 children under age 6 \u2014 to water tainted with lead.",
        "Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen (Nicholas Images) Here is a math problem for the Federal Reserve: What is 3. 25 minus 5? The answer, despite what you might think, isn\u2019t . 75. It\u2019s that it doesn\u2019t matter what it is as long as it\u2019s much less than zero. Why is that? Because, as we\u2019ll get to in a minute, this tells us where interest rates are probably going to end up the next time there\u2019s a recession. But that can\u2019t be too far into negative territory.",
        "The author (right) and her sister, Aletha, at a friend\u2019s wedding. Photo courtesy of Eleni Pinnow Editor\u2019s note: We reached out to the author after her revealing obituary for her sister appeared in the Duluth (Minn.) News Tribune. The most alone I have ever felt was standing on my front porch on a chilly February evening. My sister had taped a note to the front door that said \u201cEleni, if you\u2019re the first one here don\u2019t go in the basement. Just call 911. I don\u2019t want you to see me like this. I love you! Love, Aletha.",
        "Every once in a while \u2014 but far less often than most people think \u2014 politics appears to mirror Hollywood\u2019s dramatization of it rather than the other way around. The affair allegations Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley (R) is facing down this week is one of those moments. Here\u2019s the story: On Tuesday, the governor fired the state\u2019s top cop. That same day, the top cop told the Birmingham News that Bentley had been having an affair with one of his top advisers. And he said he could prove it.",
        "BEIRUT \u2014 As European governments scramble to contain the expanding terrorist threat posed by the Islamic State, on the battlefield in Iraq and Syria the group is a rapidly diminishing force. In the latest setbacks for the militants on Thursday, Syrian government troops entered the outskirts of the historic town of Palmyra after a offensive aided by Russian and U. S. airstrikes helped Iraqi forces overrun a string of Islamic State villages in northern Iraq that had been threatening a U. S. base nearby.",
        "BRUSSELS \u2014 A top European security official warned Thursday that the threat of Islamic State attacks is greater than previous assessments, underscoring calls for tighter security even as police widened the hunt for accomplices in the Brussels blasts. Rob Wainwright, chief of Europol, said that the terrorist group has adopted a \u201dmore aggressive\u201d posture toward Europe and that security authorities were focused on about 5, 000 suspects who had become radicalized in Europe and traveled to Syria to fight. Many have now returned.",
        "The FBI is testing a possible method to help unlock a terrorist\u2019s iPhone on a number of different devices and operating systems before it tries the actual phone in question, law enforcement officials said Thursday. The agency anticipates it will soon be able to test the approach on the iPhone used by one of the shooters in the San Bernardino, Calif. attack, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.",
        "So one of the most polarizing players in professional sports has signed up with one of the most chaotic franchises in the NFL to play one of the most unstable positions, on any team, in any league. Godspeed, RGIII. Might want to rent, not buy. Thursday\u2019s news that Robert Griffin III was headed to Cleveland felt both agonizing and inevitable to many who watched his pro career ascend, and then crash, and then implode, and then attract rabid muskrats with radioactive teeth.",
        "Comedian Garry Shandling died on Thursday, according to the Associated Press. The star of \u201cThe Larry Sanders Show\u201d appeared fine earlier in the day, TMZ reported, and was taken to the hospital this morning after someone made an emergency 911 call from his house.

        "In all the discussion of Donald Trump\u2019s romp to the Republican nomination, you might have missed that there was actually an electoral catastrophe in Arizona on Tuesday, and it didn\u2019t involve Trump\u2019s victory. It was about polling places, a seemingly mundane topic that threatens to put a thumb on the scale for Republicans in the fall. And it\u2019s just as they planned. People all over Arizona are livid about the fact that they had to wait as much as five hours to vote on Tuesday, because Republicans in the state drastically cut back on the number of polling places.",
        "Hand it to Sean Hannity: Even after colleague Bill O\u2019Reilly got schooled last week by Univision anchor Jorge Ramos, he himself invited Ramos on his Fox News program for essentially the same discussion. Last Wednesday, O\u2019Reilly wondered aloud how Ramos could cover Trump when \u201cyou\u2019re on the record as calling him an bigot?\u201d Ramos referenced Trump\u2019s famous comment from his campaign kickoff announcement last June: \u201cWhen you say that Mexican immigrants are criminals or rapists, that is, for many people, a racist remark. \u201d O\u2019Reilly lashed back: \u201cBut he didn\u2019t say all of them were.",
        "Winston Churchill once famously said that Americans could always be counted upon to do the right thing after exhausting all other possibilities. In the bloody aftermath of the Brussels attacks, Mr. Churchill appears to have been an optimist. Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz responded to Tuesday\u2019s terrorist strikes by offering the campaign\u2019s most destructive policy proposal since Donald Trump pledged to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. In an embarrassing race to the bottom, the Texas senator hatched an Orwellian plot to lay siege to American neighborhoods populated by worshipers of Islam.",
        "Sudden, horrific events in the middle of a presidential campaign provide an of the instincts and thinking of the candidates. We can see what their priorities are and pick up clues about their character. The terrorist attacks in Belgium brought out the worst in Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. Cruz demonstrated that his only focus right now is to find ways of Trump. He seeks words that sound at least as intolerant and as dangerous to civil liberties as the formulations that regularly burst forth from the Republican . E. J.",
        "Each week, In Theory takes on a big idea in the news and explores it from a range of perspectives. This week, we\u2019re talking about the rise of socialism. Emily Ekins is a research fellow and director of polling at the Cato Institute. Millennials are the only age group in America in which a majority views socialism favorably. A national survey found that 53 percent of Americans under 30 have a favorable view of socialism compared with less than a third of those over 30.",
        "DANE, Wis. Donald Trump\u2019s ability to roil the presidential race with a few swipes of a smartphone was revealed again in Wisconsin. Before a visit to a factory, Sen. Ted Cruz ( .) the only Republican currently stumping here had to field questions about the week\u2019s second Trump tweet that mocked the senator\u2019s wife Heidi. \u201cOur spouses and our children are off bounds,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIt is not acceptable for a big, loud New York bully to attack my wife.",
        "North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un has overseen the launch of a rocket, state media announced Thursday, claiming a major technological advancement that could greatly increase Pyongyang\u2019s ability to strike other countries, including the United States. Experts are working to verify North Korea\u2019s latest boast but, if true, it would mark another worrying development in the state\u2019s pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. \u201cThis is dangerous,\u201d said Melissa Hanham, senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey, Calif. \u201cBased on the images we have, we can\u2019t say whether this is functional,\u201d she said."
