        "Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) signed a controversial abortion bill Thursday that, among other things, would ban the procedure if it is sought because the fetus was diagnosed with a disability or defect such as Down syndrome.

        "The Justice Department on Thursday announced it has indicted seven hackers associated with the Iranian government and charged them with cybercrimes. The crimes include disrupting U. S. banks\u2019 public websites from late 2011 through May 2013 and with breaking into a small dam in Rye, N. Y. in an apparent attempt to stop its operation. The indictment marks the first time the government is charging people linked to a national government with disrupting or attempting to disrupt critical U. S. infrastructure or computer systems of key industries such as finance and water.",
        "A former Bosnian Serb leader was found guilty of genocide and other charges on Thursday for his role in deadly campaigns during the Bosnian war in the 1990s, including the massacres of thousands in Srebrenica, as an international tribunal announced a reckoning in Europe\u2019s bloodiest chapter since World War II. Radovan Karadzic was found guilty of 10 charges that touched on many of the atrocities and policies that stunned the world as Bosnia became a crucible for the rivalries and fears that tore apart Yugoslavia.",
        "Another industry is warning Georgia\u2019s governor not to sign a bill into law \u2014 the latest to suggest that the state risks losing business over the measure. Actors, writers, producers, directors, movie studios and whole entertainment companies have weighed in on the debate, many calling the bill discriminatory and some threatening to sever ties with Georgia if it\u2019s passed. The latest threat comes from a group of 34 individuals in the movie business, including celebrities Kristin Chenoweth, Lee Daniels, Anne Hathaway, Seth MacFarlane, Julianne Moore, Rob Reiner and Marisa Tomei.

        "\u201cWe need to direct our attention inward and connect to the breath,\u201d yoga instructor Rachel Brathen writes in her New York Times book about the practice. \u201cFocusing on our breath keeps us present, calms the mind, and allows us to develop the awareness of the body we need to practice with care and compassion. \u201d Since the ancient discipline with roots in Hinduism and Buddhism became a popular exercise in the West, yogis have inundated popular culture with their pursuit of that elusive \u201ccalm\u201d in a rapidly spinning world.",
        "President Johnson holds his pet dog \u2018Yuki\u2019 in the window of the car as the first family rides around the Texas ranch in Stonewall, Sept. 30, 1967. (AP Photo) Many animal lovers know and savor that happy moment when a pet dog or cat runs up to greet them at the end of the day and the stresses of work and human interaction are melted away. The more stressful the day, the sweeter that evening reward.",
        "PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 Donald Trump had a problem. He\u2019d met two people who seemed as stubborn as he: a feisty widow whose house stood in the way of his Atlantic City casino expansion, and her attorney. Trump\u2019s approach struck his adversaries as brazen. Even though the widow was suing him for damaging her house, Trump called her attorney, Glenn Zeitz, and, according to Zeitz, tried to hire him for a potentially more lucrative case. Zeitz rejected the offer, which came as Trump was also pressing him to settle the dispute and persuade his client to sell her house.",
        "A nasty feud that escalated Thursday between Donald Trump and his chief Republican rival over their wives set off a new wave of alarm among establishment Republicans, who fear that the GOP would drive away female voters in a fight with likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Trump\u2019s gender problem flared again this week as he and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas traded insults while Cruz\u2019s wife, Heidi, became the target of vitriol on social media from Trump and his supporters.",
        "BRUSSELS \u2014 Belgian authorities missed a chance to press a key terrorism suspect for intelligence in the days ahead of the suicide bombings that struck the capital, prosecutors said Friday, acknowledging a significant security lapse that may have allowed his allies to attack unimpeded. Even as the men involved in Tuesday\u2019s attacks were racing to strike, fearful that authorities were closing in on them, investigators did not ask the attackers\u2019 jailed ally, Salah Abdeslam, about his knowledge of future plots, Belgian federal prosecutors said Friday.",
        "It\u2019s Wednesday, so Kim Conley will run 11 miles, pretty much like any other day, except that on Wednesdays, she runs depleted \u2014 meaning she\u2019s eaten exactly nothing. The idea is to be tough, reach down, push herself even harder than every other day. She chews up the miles along the American River in Sacramento to keep shaving off seconds to keep getting closer to Rio. Conley, 30, has been running toward this summer\u2019s Olympic Games for nearly a decade. But she\u2019d also like to have a baby someday.",
        "During a recent town hall in Columbus, Ohio, Sen. Bernie Sanders said the unthinkable. At least, you would have thought he did, judging by the response of several Democratic operatives. Sanders was deemed \u201cextremely disgraceful\u201d by Donna Brazile, vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, and \u201ca political calculating fraud\u201d by Brad Woodhouse, a former DNC communications director. What was his crime?",
        "Here\u2019s some food for thought. Or, rather, here are some thoughts for food. Six months ago, I made a reckless vow. With Donald Trump dominating in polls, I said I\u2019d eat a column \u2014 18 column inches of toxic newsprint, ink and all \u2014 if Trump won the Republican presidential nomination. Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation\u2019s capital. He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s ignorance of government policy, both foreign and domestic, is breathtaking. The Republican Party is likely to nominate for president a man who appears to know next to nothing about the issues that would confront him in the job. Such a sweeping condemnation may sound unfair. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Trump were already busy tweeting that I\u2019m a \u201cdummy\u201d or something. But if you read the transcript of Trump\u2019s meeting with the editorial board of The Post, which took place Monday, I don\u2019t see how you can come to any other conclusion.",
        "Throughout the political world, people are expressing shock, dismay, and disgust at the argument that has broken out between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz over their wives. But this shouldn\u2019t be surprising to anyone. In fact, it was all but inevitable. To catch you up briefly: First an super PAC put out an online ad directed at Mormon women in Utah with a picture of Trump\u2019s wife Melania posing nude, on the absurd grounds that it constituted a reason to vote against Trump.",
        "With good reason, folks have been giving House Speaker Paul Ryan ( .) the blues for delivering an excellent speech on the sour \u201cstate of American politics\u201d while not calling out by name or disavowing any possible support of the noxious presidential candidacy of Donald Trump. But in his address, Ryan did something most politicians never do. He admitted making a mistake and reversing a policy position. The mistake was his condemnation of the poor as \u201ctakers,\u201d which Ryan addressed in his prepared remarks. But in a confident America, we aren\u2019t afraid to disagree with each other.",
        "A top commander for the Islamic State was killed by U. S. forces this week, the Pentagon said Friday, as the U. S. coalition ratcheted up pressure on the terrorist group in an effort to blunt its ability to strike targets abroad. Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said the commander, known as Haji Imam, was one of several terrorist leaders killed during the same week in which the jihadists unleashed a lethal attack on the Belgian capital. \u201cWe are systematically eliminating ISIL\u2019s cabinet,\u201d Carter said at a press briefing, using an acronym for the Islamic State.",
        "Sen. Jerry Moran learned this week that what happens in a Rotary Club meeting doesn\u2019t necessarily stay in a Rotary Club meeting. After the Kansas Republican\u2019s comments supporting a Senate hearing on Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland garnered national attention Thursday, conservative activist groups responded with reactions ranging from disappointment to overt threats. \u201cI think we have the responsibility to have a hearing, to have the conversation and to make a determination on the merit,\u201d said Moran, who is seeking election to a second Senate term this year. The quote was reported by the Dodge City Daily Globe.",
        "Some people believe that wider use of buses should supplement and maybe even supplant subways because buses are less expensive to operate and more flexible than rail. Now another city is experimenting with the idea that buses could help alleviate homelessness. Portland, Ore. \u2019s City Council has approved a new initiative that would give homeless people bus tickets to leave town, provided they also head to a destination where family, a job or another sort of support network is already in place for them, according to a report in The Portland Mercury.",
        "RALEIGH, N. C. \u2014 He eased himself up the stairs, toward the dais, holding onto the aluminum rails with both hands. Damn knees, supposed to be fixed last year; one more thing still unsettled. Roy Williams made it, finally, smiling as he sat and leaned toward a microphone. He began by explaining the things he would not be discussing on this sunny March afternoon. No green room and no past newspaper articles, nothing about the future or psychology or career plans of a coach at one of the most prestigious basketball programs in America.",
        "(Simon Menner) Attackers don\u2019t just need weapons to fight wars, and bombs to wreak havoc. They also need cameras to record it, the media to report it, and civilians to disseminate and digest it. \u201cIt is very absurd, but apparently the war needs a PR department to function,\u201d artist Simon Menner said. Many new battlefields and weapons of war \u2014 drones, surveillance, snipers, cyberterrorism \u2014 are invisible and rely even more on media to affirm their existence and threat. Menner\u2019s ongoing project, \u201cLast Frame Before Blast,\u201d dwells in invisible warfare.",
        "Sen. Bernie Sanders is the projected winner of the Democratic caucuses in Washington and Alaska on Saturday, two of three contests held in Western states that the independent senator from Vermont is favored to win. During an address in Wisconsin, Sanders thanked Alaska for \u201ca resounding victory. \u201d He claimed strong momentum in Washington state. \u201cWe knew things would begin to improve when we moved west,\u201d a smiling Sanders said to huge applause. The Washington results came in as he spoke, and he drew a deafening cheer when he read the news aloud.",
        "In a mathematical squeeze to make up ground in the Democratic presidential race, Bernie Sanders is preparing to ratchet up his attacks on Hillary Clinton ahead of a New York showdown that could establish how easily the party can pull itself back together for the general election.",

        "YAOUNDE, Cameroon \u2014 A teenager who surrendered before carrying out a suicide bombing attack in northern Cameroon has told authorities she was one of the 276 girls abducted from a Nigerian boarding school by Islamic extremists nearly two years ago, authorities said Saturday. If confirmed the development would mark the first news of the missing Chibok girls in many months. It has long been feared that some are being used by their Boko Haram abductors to carry out such attacks given the growing number of young female suicide bombers.",
        "Tuesday morning, I was sitting in my home office in Brussels, working on my latest children\u2019s book when a friend texted: \u201cHoly cow. Preliminary reports indicate one or more explosive devices have gone off at Zaventem airport. \u201d I immediately looked out the window at my children\u2019s Belgian school. It\u2019s barely a hundred yards away, and every day, rain or shine, the children enjoy a full hour of recess plus a break.",
        "Admit it. After the terrorist attacks in Brussels this past week, after the brief reflection for those lost or wounded and the sense of \u201coh, no, not again\u201d passed, other thoughts quickly followed. My own selfish but natural worry, as a mother of three: Should we cancel that trip to Europe this summer? In the nearly 15 years since the questions I\u2019ve fielded from family and friends have varied but never ceased: Should I buy a gun?",
        "Robert Borosage is president of the Institute for America\u2019s Future and was an adviser to Jesse Jackson\u2019s 1988 campaign. With the Republican presidential race careening toward a fractious convention in Cleveland and Donald Trump warning of riots, the coming Democratic convention has garnered little comment. But don\u2019t expect Philadelphia to be all brotherly love. Reconciling Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, and their respective camps, will take some work. Yes, modern party conventions have been turned into slickly packaged unity fests: Carefully vetted speakers deliver carefully crafted messages, while any disagreements are settled .",
        "During one of the first phone conversations I had with Papi after he left Cuba, I asked him to send me a bicycle with an umbrella attached to the seat, something I\u2019d seen in a cartoon and believed he could buy in the States because I was 4 and what wasn\u2019t possible in the land of opportunity? I never got that bike. Instead, I spent three years of my childhood without a father to teach me how to ride one. My parents were chemical engineers in Cuba; they met while working in the pharmaceutical industry.",
        "Lally Weymouth is a senior associate editor at The Washington Post. After the Cold War, Poland began slowly to remake itself, and by the last decade it had become a beacon of freedom and a model for economic reform. But nationalist undercurrents persisted in the country\u2019s politics. In the the nationalist Law and Justice Party held power briefly; last year, the party came back in force, capturing the presidency and the majority of the Parliament. Now it appears to be dismantling many of the country\u2019s democratic checks and balances, starting with its highest court.",
        "RICHMOND, Calif. \u2014 The odds were good that Lonnie Holmes, 21, would be the next person to kill or be killed in this suburb north of San Francisco. Four of his cousins had died in shootings. He was a passenger in a car involved in a shooting, police said. And he was arrested for carrying a loaded gun. But when Holmes was released from prison last year, officials in this city offered something unusual to try to keep him alive: money. They began paying Holmes as much as $1, 000 a month not to commit another gun crime."
