        "House Speaker Paul D. Ryan attempted to lift the horizons of his party with a speech last week in which he called for a competition of ideas rather than insults and constructive political debate rather than the politics of demonization. Ryan\u2019s speech was aimed at pulling the Republican Party away from Donald Trump\u2019s embrace \u2014 though he never actually mentioned Trump by name. Events quickly showed what he is up against. The speaker was quickly drowned out by a snarling argument between Trump and Sen.",
        "In the years since Sarah Palin\u2019s sound bites and the \u201cObama girl\u201d cemented 2008 as America\u2019s first \u201cYouTube election,\u201d the world\u2019s most popular video site has proven even more spellbinding \u2014 and powerful \u2014 than political campaigns ever imagined. In January, a political ad \u2014 actually, three \u2014 ranked among YouTube\u2019s 10 ads for the first time in history, delivering millions more views to campaigns than to the best commercials corporate America had to offer.",
        "Glen Grays, a postal worker in Brooklyn, had his delivery route cut short on St. Patrick\u2019s Day when he was handcuffed by four plainclothes police officers and placed in an unmarked car. Cellphone video filmed by a bystander shows Grays in his postal service uniform, holding a package, when the officers approach him. The video doesn\u2019t show what led up to the encounter. The footage was released this week by Brooklyn Borough President Eric L.",
        "San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee on Friday said he is banning city employees from traveling to North Carolina on public business after the state passed a law limiting transgender rights. \u201cWe are standing united as San Franciscans to condemn North Carolina\u2019s new discriminatory law that turns back the clock on protecting the rights of all Americans including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals,\u201d Lee said in a statement.",
        "One was a spy plane, designed to fly fast and stealthily into enemy territory; on its final flight, it cruised from Los Angeles to Washington, D. C. in an hour and four minutes, hitting 2, 124 mph, a speed record. The other was a sleek commercial jet for wealthy, travelers willing to plunk down $10, 000 for a ticket \u2014 or more \u2014 for the luxury of zipping across the Atlantic at Mach 2, or twice the speed of sound.",
        "ANAHEIM, Calif. \u2014 This March Madness has served as its usual window on goosebump basketball but also as a grim window on the issue of sexual assault on college campuses. In a stretch lawsuits from expelled basketball players were announced against Yale, whose team reached the second round of the NCAA tournament, and against the Oregon, whose team remained among the final eight teams still going as Saturday began. The suits come six months after an Association of American Universities study found that 27 percent of female students reported experiencing unwanted sexual contact while at college.",
        "Interviews by Amanda McGrath He lifts, reads enjoys everything from opera to Medieval Times and believes \u201cpeople should drive stick and not put clothes on dogs. \u201d Her hobbies include flying trapeze, trampoline, Spartan races, city strolls and archery. He\u2019s looking for someone pretty, independent, nerdy and appreciative of banter. She knows her way around a pun and hopes for a tall, outgoing guy who\u2019ll indulge her crazy adventures and keep her from getting too introverted. We sent them to Bobby Van\u2019s downtown.

        "Carolyn Forte, director of home appliances for the Good Housekeeping Institute, is paid to know the best way to get your dishes sparkling clean. She is still amazed at all the differences of opinion about dishwashers and how to run them for maximum performance. \u201cLoading the dishwasher causes a lot of angst. This is still a battle ground, and people have such strong feelings about things like \u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a control issue. \u201d Forte and her staff analyze new dishwasher models and how to get the cleanest result.",
        "The other day, as I pushed my cart around Whole Foods, a new book touting the wonders of apple cider vinegar caught me by surprise. Mainly, I was taken aback that people still considered the ingredient a magic elixir. I was under the impression that notion had been debunked way back when phones still had cords. People have been writing books on the subject at least since that era, and apparently they haven\u2019t stopped.",
        "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 A suicide blast claimed by Islamist militants ripped through crowds of families celebrating Easter at a park in the city of Lahore on Sunday, killing at least 60 people and injuring an additional 300 in an attack the jihadists said had deliberately targeted Christians. The attack was carried out by a suicide bomber in the parking lot of Gulshan Park at about 6:30 in the evening, transforming a joyful scene of picnicking families into a spectacle of chaos and horror. Many children were among the dead, local officials said.",
        "LIEGE, Belgium \u2014 Stephane Medot knows a thing or two about Belgian jails. He spent 10 years in them. Arrested for carrying out more than a dozen armed bank robberies, the stocky, Medot moved from prison to prison, from one cell of his own to another, until he served out his time. Along the way, he got a seat in a prison system that has become a breeding ground for violent Muslim extremists. Many of those involved in the Paris and Brussels attacks first did short stints in jail for relatively petty crimes.",
        "Hillary Clinton s email problems began in her first days as secretary of state. She insisted on using her personal BlackBerry for all her email communications, but she wasn t allowed to take the device into her suite of offices, a secure space known as Mahogany Row. For Clinton, this was frustrating. As a political heavyweight and chief of the nation s diplomatic corps, she needed to manage a torrent of email to stay connected to colleagues, friends and supporters. She hated having to put her BlackBerry into a lockbox before going into her own office.",
        "Back in the fall, when Donald Trump dubbed Jeb Bush \u201c\u201d Carlos Gimenez grew a little concerned. By last month, when Marco Rubio and Trump engaged in childish the Republican mayor of County thought the GOP presidential race had gotten \u201cout of hand. \u201d Now, after a tawdry week that has focused on the wives of Trump and Ted Cruz, Gimenez is certain that the race has moved totally \u201cout of bounds. \u201d \u201cPolitics is a contact sport,\u201d Gimenez said, \u201cbut there should be contact in other ways.",
        "This post has been updated. Sen. Bernie Sanders had the best night of his presidential campaign on Saturday, dominating Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the Washington, Hawaii and Alaska state caucuses by wide margins. He cut into Clinton\u2019s lead by at least and potentially more. It was the sort of night that he needs more of. But which he\u2019s almost certainly not going to get. The reason it was such a big night for Sanders was that he dominated in Washington state, beating Clinton by more than 40 points.",
        "It\u2019s bad enough that an outrage was perpetrated last week against the voters of Maricopa County, Ariz. It would be far worse if we ignore the warning that the disenfranchisement of thousands of its citizens offers our nation. In November, one of the most contentious campaigns in our history could end in a catastrophe for our democracy. A major culprit would be the U. S. Supreme Court, and specifically the conservative majority that gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013. E. J. Dionne writes about politics in a column and on the PostPartisan blog.",
        "What would the world look like today if Harry Truman or Dwight Eisenhower had shared the foreign policy inclinations of Barack Obama or, far more dangerous, Donald Trump? Obama has presided over an experiment in withdrawal from the Middle East, a region that the United States had long considered vital. Trump would accelerate the withdrawal, and make it global, because \u201cwe\u2019re a poor country now,\u201d as he told The Post\u2019s editorial board last week. Fred Hiatt is the editorial page editor of The Post. He writes editorials for the newspaper and a biweekly column that appears on Mondays.",
        "Howard Gutman was U. S. ambassador to Belgium from 2009 to 2013 and is managing director of the Gutman Group, an international consulting and investment group. Elections are about enthusiasm. Pundits will tell you, for example, that Virginia is a purple state. They are wrong. Virginia is sometimes a red state and sometimes a blue state but never a purple state. An unenthusiastic Virginia \u201d when only 2. 2\u00c2 million people vote \u201d is red. Any Democrat will have an extremely difficult time breaking 50\u00c2 percent statewide when turnout is 2. 2\u00c2 million voters.",
        "We are a very wealthy society, and we shouldn\u2019t forget it. Donald Trump \u2014 along with many other people \u2014 apparently has. Visiting recently with The Post\u2019s editorial board, here\u2019s how Trump explained his suggestion that the United States limit its overseas military commitments, including support for NATO, founded in 1949: \u201cI think that we are not in the position that we used to be. I think we were a very powerful, very wealthy country. And we\u2019re a poor country now. [Italics supplied.] . . . We\u2019re spending . . . to protect other countries.",
        "IF YOU had to reduce economic science to a single phrase, it might be this one: Incentives influence behavior. Now the federal government is about to test that proposition in an effort to curb Medicare spending on prescription drugs dispensed by physicians, which grew from $9. 5 billion in 2005 to $22 billion in 2015.",
        "BEIRUT \u2014 Syria\u2019s government declared Sunday that its forces had seized Palmyra from the Islamic State, driving the militant group out of the archaeologically significant city and dealing it a major blow. Retaking the desert city, a UNESCO world heritage site known for its ruins, is a substantial victory for Syrian President Bashar . His forces appear to have seized the upper hand in a devastating civil war that has turned into a dangerous proxy conflict.",
        "An American airlines pilot was arrested Saturday on the runway as shocked passengers looked on after he failed a breathalyzer test at the Detroit Metropolitan Airport. Flight 736, scheduled to leave Detroit about 7 a. m. en route to Philadelphia, was immediately canceled, according to ABC affiliate WXYZ. A transportation security agent was the first person to spot the pilot acting suspiciously, the station reported. Minutes before the flight was to take off, airport police were called.",
        "Chris Sabatini is an adjunct professor at Columbia University\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs and director of Global Americans, a research institute focused on the foreign policy of human rights and social inclusion. President Obama\u2019s historic trip to Cuba this past week returned U. S. and world attention to the small Caribbean island of 11 million people and the long, curious history between it and the United States. It\u2019s hard to think of a similarly sized country that has had such a memorable, tumultuous, often romantic hold on U. S. history and imagination.",
        "A controversial film that accuses the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of covering up the link between vaccines and rising autism rates has been pulled from the Tribeca Film Festival after its inclusion sparked outrage. A day after he defended the decision to screen the documentary \u201cVaxxed: From to Catastrophe,\u201d festival Robert De Niro announced in a statement Saturday that he reversed course after reviewing the film with colleagues and experts.",
        "Nearly 80 minutes into her testimony, Tiffany Paris was asked to identify two people in a photograph. \u201cMy son,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cAnd?\u201d the defense attorney asked. \u201cThe man who murdered my son,\u201d Paris snapped. Her opinion about the death was confirmed by a Montgomery County judge who ruled this week that the man, Moussa Sissoko, was guilty in the killing of his and Paris\u2019s son, Shane. Shane Paris Sissoko shortly before his death in 2001.",
        "Before Warner Bros. gets too carried away with the box office take of \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\u201d over the weekend, the studio might want to take a breath. The grim, galumphing behemoth has earned an admittedly impressive $424 million since Thursday, $254 million of it in overseas markets. But many observers estimate that \u201cBatman v Superman,\u201d which had a combined production and marketing budget of about $400 million, will need to earn at least $1 billion in order to break even, after theaters take their cut.",
        "I\u2019m lousy with numbers. But that\u2019s not why I have a financial adviser. I have one because I\u2019m even lousier with emotions. I weep at bat mitzvahs. I laugh at lamebrain YouTube videos even before pushing the play button. And when the stock market plummets, so does my financial rationality. Which is why 15 years ago \u2014 when I had finally saved more than I could stand to see dissipate \u2014 I decided to let someone else take charge of my money.",
        "An evenly divided Supreme Court delivered a major reprieve to organized labor Tuesday in a case that could have affected millions of workers and dealt a severe blow to the most muscular segment of the union movement. The justices said they were split on a challenge brought by a group of California teachers who claim their rights are violated when they are forced to pay dues to the state\u2019s teachers union.",
        "The reality of an ideologically divided, evenly split, Supreme Court became apparent Tuesday: The justices deadlocked on a major case and tried to avoid a second stalemate by floating their own policy compromise on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate. The actions underscored how the death of Justice Antonin Scalia has upended business as usual at the Supreme Court. They also provided a preview of the kind of tentative decisions that may be all the court can muster as it faces a docket filled with controversies.",
        "Republican presidential Donald Trump defended his campaign manager as a \u201cvery decent man\u201d Tuesday, hours after the staffer was charged with battery in Florida for allegedly grabbing a reporter and yanking her away from Trump. Corey Lewandowski, 42, faces one misdemeanor count of battery as a result of the March 8 incident. He voluntarily went to police headquarters in Jupiter, Fla. and signed paperwork that ordered him to appear in court on May 4. In the past, campaign staffers have been fired for far less. But Trump did not dismiss Lewandowski on Tuesday, and neither of them apologized.",
        "Actress Patty Duke died on Tuesday at age 69, and will be remembered for her many Hollywood achievements, from her turn at age 16 in \u201cThe Miracle Worker\u201d to \u201cThe Patty Duke Show\u201d on ABC. But Duke also carries another badge: The original dysfunctional survivor, as she overcame a truly horrific childhood and became one of the first public figures to speak out about her mental illness."
