        "BEIJING \u2014 A series of extraordinary outbursts of public criticism of Chinese President Xi Jinping in recent weeks has raised the question of whether his crackdown on dissent is backfiring. The sniping has come from the highest levels of the business community and the media but also, most tellingly, from within the Communist Party itself. At its core is a growing unhappiness with Xi\u2019s attempts to centralize power and crush dissent, both within the party and outside. No one is predicting that China\u2019s president is about to be toppled or even that he is about to change course.",
        "MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes interviewed actress Susan Sarandon on Monday and right now I. Can\u2019t. Even. The surrogate for Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) told Hayes, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to see what happens\u201d when he asked whether she would vote for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. Not committing to voting for Clinton wasn\u2019t terribly shocking. Sarandon had spent a considerable amount of time knocking the former secretary of state\u2019s record. But what she said about Trump was out of this world. HAYES: Right, but isn\u2019t the question always in an election about choices, right.",
        "You can have your Coke with a smile today. On Monday, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, a conservative Republican, said he would veto a bill that would have legalized discrimination against gay people, responding to an outcry from corporate interests including Home Depot, UPS, Walt Disney, Delta, Time Warner, Comcast, Netflix, Apple and the National Football League. As state legislators pushed the \u201creligious liberty\u201d bill through, Deal told them: \u201cI hope that we can all just take a deep breath, recognize that the world is changing around us.",
        "It\u2019s Tuesday, March 29, 2016, and facts are dead. They had a good run. It used to be that when people said \u201cWho are you going to believe, me, or your own eyes? ,\u201d they were joking. Not the Donald Trump campaign. It remains stubbornly impervious to reality. \u201cBut we have video footage of this happening,\u201d you can say.",
        "The waters of Lake Wobegon have flooded U. S. college campuses. A\u2019s \u2014 once reserved for recognizing excellence and distinction \u2014 are today the most commonly awarded grades in America. That\u2019s true at both Ivy League institutions and community colleges, at huge flagship publics and tiny liberal arts schools, and in English, ethnic studies and engineering departments alike. Across the country, wherever and whatever they study, mediocre students are increasingly likely to receive supposedly superlative grades. Catherine Rampell is an opinion columnist at The Washington Post.",
        "It has been more than a year since the infamous news conference at the United Nations, at which Hillary Clinton falsely asserted, \u201cI did not email any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified material. \u201d For a year the Clinton campaign has raised a number of specious excuses: \u201cIt was allowed\u201d; other secretaries did the same (not true); the emails were only retroactively classified (not true); there was no risk classified information might have been compromised (unfounded); and her offenses were not serious (highly questionable).",
        "POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS are sometimes derided for their stage management, but they can offer moments of clarity about the character of a candidate. The charging of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, with simple battery, a misdemeanor, is one such moment. How did Mr. Trump react when one of his key campaign aides apparently manhandled a reporter and then denied having done so? Instead of the rigorous and dispassionate thinking that should be prerequisites for the Oval Office, there was denial and doubling down. Police in Jupiter, Fla. charged Mr.",
        "The U. S. government\u2019s revelation that it had accessed the San Bernardino shooter\u2019s iPhone without the help from Apple that it had so desperately sought indicates the FBI was either disguising its technical capabilities or its agents and employees remain outmatched by tech workers in the private sector, according to current and former bureau officials and legal scholars. The bureau in recent years has launched a recruiting blitz to attract employees with cyber expertise, and the National Science Foundation has even made scholarship money available to students who study cybersecurity and later work in government.",
        "LAS VEGAS \u2014 Jamie Tyler was stressed. He had just endured a slog through airport security and needed some relief. Many travelers in this situation might have headed for the nearest bar or popped an aspirin. But Tyler grabbed a triangular piece of gadgetry from his bag and held it to his forehead. As he closed his eyes, the device zapped him with electrical currents. Within minutes, Tyler said, he was feeling serene enough to face the crowds once again. This is no science fiction.",
        "Justin Michael Wolfe, whose capital murder conviction and death sentence were reversed amid concerns about prosecutorial misconduct, pleaded guilty to murder in Prince William County on Tuesday, admitting in a handwritten statement that he and another man plotted the 2001 robbery and slaying of a fellow marijuana dealer. It was a stunning reversal from Wolfe, who had proclaimed his innocence for 15 years. Wolfe had argued, at times from Virginia\u2019s death row, that the murder of Daniel Petrole Jr. the son of a decorated Secret Service agent, was the work of a rogue drug associate.",
        "The United States will withdraw virtually all family members of U. S. troops and diplomats from its installations in Turkey, U. S. officials said Tuesday, citing security concerns as the campaign against the Islamic State continues. The military decision was announced on the blog for U. S. European Command, which also instituted travel restrictions in Brussels last week after a terrorist attack killed 38 people, including three suicide bombers. At least four Americans were killed and about a dozen more were wounded, including an Air Force officer who was stationed in Europe and members of his family.",
        "CAIRO \u2014 A nearly hijacking standoff in Cyprus ended Tuesday after the surrender of a man who commandeered an Egyptian airliner, claiming to have an explosive vest, officials said. There were no immediate reports of injuries among the more than 55 passengers and crew on the EgyptAir flight, and Cypriot officials said no explosives were found on the hijacker or on the aircraft. But full details of the incident remained unclear \u2014 including the motive. [What a horrific week of terrorism tells us about the world] Terrorism was not initially suspected.",
        "Not content with a rebuttal and digital ads, the NFL is taking its fight against the New York Times a step further, demanding retraction of a story the newspaper published last week about the league\u2019s allegedly incomplete concussion research and alleged ties to Big Tobacco. Brad S. Karp, the NFL\u2019s legal counsel, wrote that the story, which was headlined \u201cNFL\u2019s Flawed Concussion Research and Ties to the Tobacco Industry\u201d is \u201cfalse and defamatory\u201d in a letter to the Times that was obtained by Politico.",
        "Millennials get a bad rap for being irresponsible with money. But new studies show that not only are they carrying less debt than they did in previous years, they are actually pretty good at saving. Millennials are saving more aggressively than they have in the past, and in some cases they\u2019re saving more than their older counterparts, according to a new study from Bankrate. com. \u201cThere is a greater inclination toward saving among millennials than we\u2019ve seen in previous generations,\u201d says Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate. com.",
        "In his retirement, David Letterman has grown a beard and the beard has grown a following. He had a beard once during his \u201cLate Show\u201d tenure, when there was a writers\u2019 strike, but never to this degree. This beard is a beard that would not have passed CBS censors. This beard is a beard that could house sparrows. It is a Retirement Beard. It is a biological reaction to a lifetime of performing under intense scrutiny. Letterman\u2019s face is saying, less than a year after his final show, that it is free.",
        "For thousands of years, the Syrian city of Aleppo has sat at the crossroads of the world\u2019s great trade routes, connecting Asia, Mesopotamia, India and Europe. Persian silk and Indian spices made their way east to west on the Silk Road, while the city developed into an economic powerhouse of its own, producing textiles, soaps and dyes. The thriving commerce gave birth to Aleppo\u2019s labyrinthine warren of covered souks \u2014 marketplaces \u2014 that stretch some eight miles. But tragically, they have become one of the many casualties of Syria\u2019s war, located on the front lines in this divided city.",
        "APPLETON, Wis. \u2014 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump came under fire Wednesday for saying that women should be subject to \u201csome sort of punishment\u201d for undergoing illegal abortions, a position that antiabortion and abortion rights groups alike emphatically denounced. The GOP said during a town hall hosted by MSNBC that criminal punishments would be appropriate for women seeking abortions if the procedure were made illegal nationwide. Moderator Chris Matthews pressed Trump on the practical implications of banning abortions. \u201cThis is not something you can dodge.",
        "MILWAUKEE \u2014 There are no ordinary weeks on the trail of Campaign 2016. One week brings insults over spouses and salacious allegations from a supermarket tabloid. Now it\u2019s a campaign manager charged with battery, a candidate offering an alternative reality about the charge and a Republican Party ever more threatened with chaos, depending on its nominee. What this is about is clear to all \u2014 an unstable Republican coalition, the disruptive candidacy of Donald Trump and an alarmed GOP \u201cestablishment\u201d that has proved (not surprisingly) to be powerless or helpless in the face of unfolding events.",
        "Metro\u2019s top officials warned Wednesday that the transit system is in such need of repair that they might shut down entire rail lines for as long as six months for maintenance, potentially snarling thousands of daily commutes and worsening congestion in the already region. Board Chairman Jack Evans and General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld put rail riders on notice about possible extended closures at a conference of local leaders. The discussion also revealed strong resistance to what Evans said was a \u201cdire\u201d need for more than $1 billion a year in additional funding for Metro.",

        "This story has been updated. Sea levels could rise nearly twice as much as previously predicted by the end of this century if carbon dioxide emissions continue unabated, an outcome that could devastate coastal communities around the globe, according to new research published Wednesday. The main reason? Antarctica. Scientists behind a new study published in the journal Nature used sophisticated computer models to decipher a longstanding riddle about how the massive, mostly uninhabited continent surrendered so much ice during previous warm periods on Earth.",
        "Barack Obama is president of the United States. Of all the threats to global security and peace, the most dangerous is the proliferation and potential use of nuclear weapons. That\u2019s why, seven years ago in Prague, I committed the United States to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and to seeking a world without them. This vision builds on the policies of presidents before me, Democrat and Republican, including Ronald Reagan, who said \u201cwe seek the total elimination one day of nuclear weapons from the face of the Earth.",
        "Whatever else one may think about Donald Trump, he has a gift for labeling opponents.

        "THE SUPREME Court on Tuesday made its two most significant moves since losing Justice Antonin Scalia, splitting 4 to 4 on a major case involving teachers unions and calling for a rare rebriefing in a blockbuster contraception case. In both instances, having a split court led to a decent outcome. Yet Tuesday\u2019s news also showed why keeping the court understaffed for any significant length of time would be bad for the law, the court and the country.",
        "The Food and Drug Administration has changed its guidelines for use of the abortion pill, potentially increasing access to a method of pregnancy termination that has been heavily restricted in some states. The changes bring the guidelines in line with what many doctors consider standard practice. They also undercut one strategy that had been used by antiabortion activists to reduce access to abortion, which women are increasingly using as an alternative to the surgical procedure.",
        "President Obama commuted the sentences of 61 inmates Wednesday, part of his ongoing effort to give relief to prisoners who were harshly sentenced in the nation\u2019s war on drugs. More than of the inmates were serving life sentences. Obama has granted clemency to 248 federal inmates, including Wednesday\u2019s commutations. White House officials said that Obama will continue granting clemency to inmates who meet certain criteria set out by the Justice Department throughout his last year. The president has vowed to change how the criminal justice system treats nonviolent drug offenders.",
        "The boondoggle of the week award goes to the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Defense Department. They joined forces to combat illegal drugs in Afghanistan, but ended up with an expensive plane that, like their grand plans, won\u2019t fly. But the cost has soared. The plan was for DOD to modify a DEA plane to be used in operations in a combat zone. DEA purchased an ATR 500 aircraft in September 2008 for $8. 6 million. Eight years later, the cost of the program has ballooned without the plane ever getting off the ground for its intended mission.",
        "Armed with a sheathed sword and scripture, Mississippi Sen. Hillman Frazier (D) scolded his colleagues on Tuesday morning. Supporters of the Mississippi Church Protection Act, which lets places of worship appoint members to serve as armed security for congregants, were using religion as a shield for an expansion of gun rights, he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to pimp the church for political purposes,\u201d he said before the chamber, according to the . \u201cIf you want to pass a bill liberalizing gun laws, then do that.

        "A college student has received a wealth of interest in his dental work after publishing an account of straightening his own teeth for $60. Amos Dudley, who studies digital design at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, had no dentistry experience when he decided to create plastic aligners to improve his smile. After publishing pictures of his teeth this month, Dudley has received hundreds of requests from strangers, asking him to straighten their teeth. Dudley\u2019s project has raised the question of whether the cost of professional dental care is unnecessarily high.",
        "Alexandra Elbakyan is a highbrow pirate in hiding. The graduate student from Kazakhstan is operating a searchable online database of nearly 50 million stolen scholarly journal articles, shattering the $10 paywall of academic publishers. Elbakyan has kept herself beyond the reach of a federal judge who late last year issued an injunction against her site, noting that damages could total $150, 000 per article \u2014 a sum that Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis, a journal in her database, could help calculate. But she is not hiding from responsibility."
