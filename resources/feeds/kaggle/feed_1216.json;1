        "Why is it that some people can stay healthy only by sticking to a strict vegetarian diet? Why is it that others can eat a steak a day, remain slim, avoid heart disease and feel like a million dollars? The answers may lie in your heritage. Cornell University researchers have found a fascinating genetic variation that they said appears to have evolved in populations that favored vegetarian diets over hundreds of generations.",
        "The troops that recently recaptured Palmyra, Syria, from the Islamic State included Syrian, Iranian and Hezbollah forces. And on Monday, Russian officials said there was another group that contributed to the victory: Russia\u2019s elite special forces, also known as Spetsnaz. Russian troops are nothing new to the Syrian ground war. Since their arrival in September, the Russians have used naval infantry to secure a key port in Tartus and the perimeter of an airfield in Latakia.",
        "We want to make life more beautiful. It\u2019s a simple, declarative statement by Astrid Riecken, a photographer, and her partner, Samantha. They miss the days when people dressed up before they boarded planes or went to dinner or rode the bus into town. They miss the style of the century, or earlier, and they are recreating its allure in photographs that Riecken posts to Instagram. There is Samantha on the edge of the Tidal Basin, a wispy feather jutting out from her felt hat.",
        "HARRISON, N. Y. \u2014 Hillary Clinton\u2019s fight for the presidency has arrived in her home state, where she is planning a blitz to deal with the challenge of simultaneously competing against two fellow New Yorkers: Donald Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders. Although New York\u2019s primary is still nearly three weeks away, its 247 delegates are expected to make it a critical contest in determining the Democratic nomination.

        "A Maryland appeals court has issued what civil liberties groups called the first appellate opinion in the country stating that police must obtain a warrant before using covert devices, rebuking Baltimore police and prosecutors for \u201cmisleading\u201d judges for years about secret and \u201cunconstitutionally intrusive conduct. \u201d Maryland\u2019s intermediate Court of Special Appeals issued the strongly worded opinion late Wednesday following a March 3 order that Baltimore police could not use evidence collected by a simulator device against defendant Kerron Andrews, charged with attempted murder in 2014.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s way easier to get drugs than a good greasy bean,\u201d Travis Milton says, taking a deep drag on his cigarette. And that causes the chef a lot of headaches. For one, greasies are his favorite beans, whether you cook them stewing them within an inch of their lives, or use a more modern technique such as steaming to show off the sweet, fat kernels inside. But the elusiveness of greasies (named for their slick appearance, not their taste) is more than just a personal problem for Milton.",

        "Donald Trump would be \u201cthe least popular major party nominee in modern times,\u201d today\u2019s Post headline blares. That sounds pretty bad! But if you dig into the demographic breakdown of the Post\u2019s new analysis of this month\u2019s polling, which looks at Trump\u2019s favorability across a range of voter groups, it looks even worse. Click to enlarge: These numbers are simply amazing. Trump is viewed unfavorably by at least 80 percent of some of the groups that Republican strategists had hoped the GOP might improve among: young voters and Latinos. He\u2019s viewed unfavorably by three out of four moderates.",
        "Although people\u2019s views on abortion ultimately turn on their fundamental beliefs about the nature and beginnings of human life, there has always been a logical flaw in the antiabortion case. If abortion is the taking of a human life \u2014 knowingly and purposefully \u2014 how can it not be a crime for a woman to procure one? If a doctor who performs an abortion is little better than a murderer for hire, how can you punish the doctor and let the patient go free? Few antiabortion activists have troubled to ponder this anomaly.",
        "As a matter of politics, Donald Trump\u2019s comment that women who have abortions should suffer \u201csome form of punishment\u201d was a disaster. As a matter of intellectual and moral consistency, Trump\u2019s got a point \u2014 one that exposes a fundamental tension in the Republican Party between its assertion that life begins at conception and the legal and moral implications of that absolutist view. The party\u2019s platform has been clear for years, even if its own presidential candidates, for obvious reasons of have strayed from its strict dictates.",
        "Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s ongoing hustle of the Democratic Party was revealed at the very end of his interview with Rachel Maddow on Wednesday. Lauding the Independent from Vermont\u2019s fundraising prowess, the MSNBC anchor asked Sanders when he might start applying his considerable abilities to benefit the Democratic Party. In his response, Sanders pointed out that the average $27 contribution to his presidential campaign is \u201ca very different way of raising money than Secretary Clinton has pursued. \u201d So, Maddow pressed him. MADDOW: Well, obviously your priority is the nomination, but I mean you raised Secretary Clinton there.",
        "\u201cI JUST think we have much bigger risks,\u201d Donald Trump told us last week. We had asked the Republican presidential candidate about climate change, a phenomenon in which he said he is \u201cnot a big believer. \u201d Don\u2019t good businessmen hedge against risks, spending something now to avoid potentially negative outcomes later? \u201cI think our biggest form of climate change we should worry about is nuclear weapons,\u201d he responded. Mr. Trump is not alone among Republicans in citing other scary problems to illogically ignore the danger of a warming world. Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Ohio Gov.",
        "For decades now, the U. S. women\u2019s national soccer team has made less money for better work. The players don\u2019t just deserve equal pay. They deserve back pay \u2014 about 25 years\u2019 worth. That\u2019s how long they\u2019ve been fighting the U. S. Soccer Federation over their inferior treatment. Finally, they filed a federal discrimination complaint. You know what drove them to it? The USSF called them \u201cirrational\u201d for asking for a raise.

S. troops more than a decade ago, is back in action in Iraq \u2014 this time as a champion of political reforms.

        "A Google Maps error has been sending tourists seeking \u201dMt. Rushmore, SD\u201d to the wrong location for nearly five years now. Storm Mountain Center, a retreat center located some 13 miles from the real Mt. Rushmore, has repeatedly asked Google Maps to update the Mt. Rushmore address.

        "MILWAUKEE \u2014 There was a danger sign for Hillary Clinton in a dank old industrial warehouse here along the Milwaukee River. The walls had been painted over with modernist murals bearing the likeness of Bernie Sanders. This was now a campaign field office. And the volunteers, young and old, who manned a phone bank Thursday afternoon vowed never to give up their time \u2014 or, for some, even their votes \u2014 to Clinton.
