        "You wake up and no one is talking about Donald Trump. The sky is blue. The birds are singing. He fizzled out at the end of summer. He was fun, but the pundits were right. All the people who make predictions for a living were right. That is why they make predictions for a living: because they know what they are doing, and they deserve to be on TV all of the time. They understood.",
        "For the past few weeks, I\u2019ve been working on an investigative series about police abuse in South Carolina. I\u2019ve found a dizzying number of cases, including illegal arrests, botched raids, fatal shootings and serious questions about how all those incidents are investigated. Many of these cases were previously unreported, or if they were reported, the initial reports were a far cry from what actually happened. The series will run at some point in the next week. But in the meantime, I want to share one particularly horrifying incident that I came across this week while researching the series.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: The Clinton and Sanders campaigns are battling this morning over a moment on the campaign trail yesterday, in which Hillary Clinton appeared to lose her temper in a confrontation with a Greenpeace activist.

        "MANY TIMES since the New York real estate mogul commenced his presidential campaign, wishful analysts have declared \u201cPeak Trump. \u201d Remember when The Donald sneered at Sen. John McCain\u2019s ( .) war record? Or crudely mocked a New York Times reporter\u2019s disability and then denied having done so? Or made bizarre insinuations about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly\u2019s hormonal balance? Or shrugged at a Klansman\u2019s support? Each transgression prompted pundits to predict that, at last, the GOP had gone too far and that his improbably high support within the GOP primary electorate would collapse.",
        "Three episodes into FX\u2019s critically acclaimed miniseries \u201cThe People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story,\u201d Sarah Paulson (as beleaguered prosecutor Marcia Clark) let the mother of all fly. She said it with sheer contempt, upon learning that the defense team had hired Johnnie Cochran (Courtney B. Vance). In another episode, Vance yelled the when Cochran\u2019s was interviewed alongside his alleged mistress on \u201cA Current Affair. \u201d The word used to be forbidden on basic cable.
