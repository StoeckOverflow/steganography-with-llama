        "By the time New comedian Billy Procida was 24, he\u2019d noticed a pattern: The women he hooked up with never wanted to get serious. A romantic, he didn\u2019t understand what he was doing to disqualify himself from being relationship material. Who better to ask, he figured, than his past flings themselves? That was the genesis of The Manwhore Podcast: A Quest for Love. Each week, Procida interviews a different woman from his past about love, sex and where things went wrong between them.",
        "MILWAUKEE \u2014 Wisconsin has become an unexpected battleground for Donald Trump and the conglomeration of forces desperately aligning against him, with Tuesday\u2019s primary emerging as a key moment that could reshape the Republican nominating contest both mathematically and psychologically. Ted Cruz \u2014 who has tried to unite conservative activists, personalities and the party establishment \u2014 stands poised to take some air out of the Trump balloon. Bleeding from two weeks of wounds and behind in the polls here, Trump scrambled over the weekend to make up ground here he has lost to the Texas senator.",
        "Establishment Republicans can barely contain their excitement after the events of the past seven days. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, was charged with battery in Florida for an incident in which he grabbed a reporter \u2014 and then denied doing so. Then Trump spent 48 hours defending Lewandowski and insisting the reporter had made up her story. Trump followed that political car wreck with another one \u2014 telling MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews that if abortion were ever banned, women who had the procedure should be punished.",
        "U. S. Special Operations forces are using rifle sights that are supposed to help shooters accurately hit their targets but instead have a defect, acknowledged by the manufacturer, that potentially endangers the lives of service members in combat, according to court records and military officials. The U. S. government is aware of the problem and sued the sight\u2019s maker in November for fraud, accusing the company, Communications, of covering up a variety of issues with the sight, which has been used by every branch of the military, the FBI, the State Department and local law enforcement.",
        "Beverly Cleary doesn\u2019t really want to talk about turning 100. \u201cGo ahead and fuss,\u201d she says of the big day, April 12. \u201cEveryone else is. \u201d Across the country, people are delving into Cleary nostalgia, with celebrations and new editions of her books with introductions by the likes of Amy Poehler and Judy Blume. Kids and adults are being asked to \u201cDrop Everything and Read\u201d to commemorate Cleary\u2019s contribution to children\u2019s literature. But the beloved children\u2019s author has something far more in mind for herself: a celebratory slice of carrot cake, she says, \u201cbecause I like it.",
        "It\u2019s time to go back to where we began: not only that Donald Trump will lose the Republican presidential nomination, but also that he could be so weakened by the end of the primaries that his party will not even have to worry about choosing someone else. I feel your skepticism. Hasn\u2019t Trump so far defied all predictions of his demise? Absolutely. Hasn\u2019t every claim that \u201cnow he\u2019s gone too far\u201d been wrong? Of course. E. J. Dionne writes about politics in a column and on the PostPartisan blog.",
        "David Cole, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center, is author of the new book \u201cEngines of Liberty: The Power of Citizen Activists to Make Constitutional Law. \u201d Liberals are understandably excited, and conservatives equally concerned, that the Supreme Court seat vacated by Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death may be filled by a Democratic president \u2014 with either Merrick Garland, President Obama\u2019s nominee, or Hillary Clinton\u2019s nominee, should she win the election. The court\u2019s ideological majority lies in the balance. The conservatives have had a long run.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s recent rhetoric about an \u201cobsolete\u201d NATO alliance has surely disturbed Germans and French who think about their nations\u2019 security. But their anxiety level is probably low next to that of a dozen Eurasian nations that Trump has probably never considered \u2014 including a few that are not even members of NATO. One of them is Georgia. This predominately Christian former Soviet republic of 4.",
        "A paradox of our time concerns productivity. We are awash in transformative technologies \u2014 smartphones, tablets, big data \u2014 and yet the growth in labor productivity, which should benefit from all the technology, is dismal. This matters. Productivity is economic lingo for efficiency, and it\u2019s the wellspring of higher living standards. If productivity lags, so will wages and incomes. The latest figures are disheartening. From 2010 to 2015, average labor productivity for the entire economy rose a meager 0. 3 percent a year.",
        "Perhaps the laws of political gravity are about to take hold in the case of Donald Trump. But the lesson of this appalling primary season cautions against discounting Trump\u2019s appeal \u2014 which prompts another Trump column, this one on the utter incoherence of his policy views. It\u2019s not simply that Trump is wrong on policy. Ted Cruz is wrong on policy. Trump is wrong on policy and argues for policy positions glaringly inconsistent with his asserted principles. All politicians do this, sure. But Trump\u2019s incoherence is classically Trumpian \u2014 huge, glitzy, unembarrassed.",
        "LAST WEEK, some of the world\u2019s autocrats came to town for the Nuclear Security Summit men who have thrown their critics in prison and destroyed the fabric of civil society. They got polite treatment from the Obama administration. They deserved worse. Take President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan, who has regularly imprisoned his critics. He released a batch of prisoners before the summit, perhaps thinking that would take the edge off, although investigative journalist Khadija Ismayilova remains behind bars for no good reason and rights activists Leyla and Arif Yunus are barred from leaving the country.",
        "The retired police major paced around a crime scene he never imagined he\u2019d see. Inside his son and \u2019s rented colonial in Northern Virginia, shards of window glass were scattered by the front door in little heaps. Upstairs in the master bedroom, his son\u2019s camouflage Army uniforms hung in the closet. In a nearby bathroom, a book titled \u201cReconciliation: How to Restore Broken Relationships\u201d sat on the sink\u2019s edge.",
        "The three Republican appointees on the divided Federal Election Commission have indicated that political donors who give through private companies solely to shield their identities can be sanctioned, signaling that the agency may scrutinize a rash of \u201c \u201d corporations giving large sums to super PACs. Their stance suggests the potential for movement by the polarized panel, where a sense of stasis has been the norm. Democratic commissioners, however, reacted with skepticism, saying that their GOP colleagues have until now delayed and actively blocked examination of such cases.",
        "Statins like Lipitor and its generics have revolutionized cardiovascular care for nearly two decades as an effective, inexpensive way to reduce LDL cholesterol, the bad cholesterol in the bloodstream. Not everyone can take them, though; a significant number of people complain of muscle pain, weakness and cramping so severe that they discontinue the therapy even at the risk of a heart attack or stroke. Their resistance to the medication has been controversial, because in most cases there are no biomarkers for the muscle problems individuals describe.",
        "MOSCOW \u2014 Even as Azerbaijan announced a unilateral Sunday, reports of sporadic fighting between Azerbaijani and ethnic Armenian forces over the separatist enclave of continued. Regional and world leaders called for an end to the worst violence in the region since a halted a war over the territory in 1994. Armenia and Azerbaijan, both former Soviet republics, fought a bloody ethnic war over the territory as the Soviet Union fell apart. About 20, 000 people died.",
        "An international collection of journalists published a report Sunday on the financial activities of a dozen current and former world leaders that said associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin have moved as much as $2 billion through offshore accounts. The report is based on a data leak of 11. 5 million records for 214, 488 entities connected to people in more than 200 countries or territories. The leak includes emails, financial spreadsheets, passport information and corporate records. It spans nearly 40 years, from 1977 through the end of 2015.",
        "You can see the exact moment last week that Donald Trump made up his mind on whether women would face criminal punishment once he signed new restrictions into law. He is at a town hall with MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews, and, after Matthews badgers him for a while, he finally answers the question. \u201cThe answer is . .. that,\u201d Trump says, eyes looking to the side in thought, \u201cthere has to be some form of punishment. \u201d He punctuates \u201chas\u201d with a hand gesture. Done. Final.",
        "In another sign of the fight left in Bernie Sanders\u2019s campaign, the Democratic presidential hopeful appears to have picked up at least a couple of delegates in Nevada, a state where Hillary Clinton was declared the winner on Feb. 20. Clinton emerged on caucus day with a lead of 20 to 15 in statewide delegates. According to a report from Nevada, that margin has narrowed to 18 to 17 after a second round in the process, known as the county conventions, which took place Saturday.",
        "(Updating: Adding comment from Florida Department of Education) The Florida testing outrages just keep on coming. Last month, I wrote about Paula Drew, a mom who asked the Florida Education Department for a exemption for her daughter, Madison Drew, who has cerebral palsy, suffers from a number of conditions related to her condition that have left her unable to speak and takes several medications daily to prevent seizures, which can affect her cognitive abilities. The department said no.",
        "The Supreme Court unanimously ruled Monday that states may satisfy \u201cone person, one vote\u201d rules by drawing election districts based on the total population of a place, a defeat for conservative interests that wanted the districts based only on the number of people eligible to vote. The case, Evenwel v. Abbott, was considered one of the most important on voting rights this term, and a decision the other way would have shifted political power away from urban areas, where Democrats usually dominate, and toward more rural areas.",
        "Most of the best selling cars in America, such as the Honda Accord or Nissan Altima, generally hit around 300, 000 in sales every year. Tesla saw 276, 000 people to buy its newest Model 3 sedan \u2014 in two days. That massive number, which far exceeded optimistic forecasts, upends traditional thinking about how to sell cars and is expected to spur the auto industry to shift more dramatically to market electric technology to consumers, analysts said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything quite like this in the auto industry,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at Edmunds. com.",
        "African Americans are routinely for their pain compared with whites, according to research. A study released Monday sheds some disturbing light on why that might be the case. Researchers at the University of Virginia quizzed white medical students and residents to see how many believed inaccurate and at times \u201dfantastical\u201d differences about the two races for example, that blacks have less sensitive nerve endings than whites or that black people\u2019s blood coagulates more quickly. They found that fully half thought at least one of the false statements presented was possibly, probably or definitely true.",
        "On Thursday, Donald Trump, with campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, press secretary Hope Hicks and son Donald Trump Jr. sat down at the Trump International Hotel in Washington with reporters Bob Woodward and Robert Costa. It was, as you might expect, fascinating. The transcript is below. I annotated it using Genius. To see an annotation, click or tap the highlighted part of the transcript; if you would like to leave your own annotations, make sure you have a Genius account.",
        "In a private document that was circulated over the weekend and obtained by The Washington Post, Trump campaign senior adviser Barry Bennett revealed the mounting frustrations among the billionaire s top aides as they closed what had been a tumultuous week.",
        "For a moment, let\u2019s take Donald Trump\u2019s economic promises seriously. Trump says he can pay off a $19 trillion national debt within eight years as president. He says he can do this while cutting taxes. He has not detailed any substantial cuts he would make to federal spending, so what he is really making is a growth argument \u2014 that he could supercharge the economy, creating sufficient budget surpluses to retire the debt. \u201dThe power is trade,\u201d he told the Post in an interview last week.",
        "Let\u2019s not be coy. There\u2019s a certain population in this country that expects unlimited government handouts despite its piggish unwillingness to work. Don\u2019t tell me this is about their responsibilities, or lack of access to transportation or education. Nonsense. These people simply don\u2019t want to work. Catherine Rampell is an opinion columnist at The Washington Post. View Archive Facebook Google+ Ladies and gentlemen, meet the new welfare queens: your democratically elected U. S. legislators, the laziest, most generation of federal politicians in decades. Sure, they talk a big game about work ethic and personal responsibility.",
        "The 19th century had the debates. The 20th century brought . And now we have just experienced a forensic masterpiece to define our times: the Debate Debate. This particular rhetorical showdown was not a about issues, appropriately enough, but an argument about whether to debate \u2014 and when, and where. It began Jan. 30, when the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign challenged Hillary Clinton to debate him in Brooklyn on April 14. Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation\u2019s capital. He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000.",
        "Not so fast, everybody. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, Wisconsin will not be the end of Donald Trump. It will not even be the beginning of the end. But it might be the end of the beginning. To be sure, Trump had a terrible, horrible, atrocious week. But imagine the scenario for him: He wins none of Wisconsin\u2019s 42 convention delegates in Tuesday\u2019s primary, while his nearest rival, Sen. Ted Cruz ( .) wins them all. Eugene Robinson writes a column on politics and culture, contributes to the PostPartisan blog, and hosts a weekly online chat with readers.",
        "JANESVILLE, Wis. \u2014 Fifteen years of community organizing had led Z! Haukeness to the lobby of the Holiday Inn Express here. Haukeness, who is 34 and transgender and prefers the \u201c \u201d pronoun, wore red sneakers, white jeans and a white printed with the phrase \u201cFirst They Came for Queer & Trans People. \u201d It was a reference to the famous poem about how not enough people had tried to stop Adolf Hitler when he persecuted one minority group after the next. Donald Trump was scheduled to rally in Janesville the next day. Haukeness wanted to stop him.",
        "MYTILENE, Greece \u2014 The European Union began offloading its refugee crisis onto its Turkish neighbors Monday, sending back more than 200 migrants in the first stage of a plan to deport thousands that has drawn condemnation from human rights groups. The returns \u2014 carried out at dawn and under heavy security \u2014 were intended to send a powerful message to others considering the journey from Turkey to Greece via a smuggler\u2019s rubber raft: Don\u2019t even bother."
