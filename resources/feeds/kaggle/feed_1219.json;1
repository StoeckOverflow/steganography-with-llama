        "Whenever minimum wage increases are proposed on the state or federal level, business groups tend to fight them tooth and nail. But actual opposition may not be as united as the groups\u2019 rhetoric might make it appear, according to internal research conducted by a leading consultant for state chambers of commerce. The survey of 1, 000 business executives across the country was conducted by LuntzGlobal, the firm run by Republican pollster Frank Luntz, and obtained by a liberal watchdog group called the Center for Media and Democracy.",
        "researchers and terrorism experts do not like turning their calendars to April.

        "Why do restaurants often feel like such etiquette minefields? Is it because we\u2019re so immersed in the online world we\u2019ve forgotten how to interact with our fellow humans? Or because we\u2019re so stressed in every other aspect of our lives? Or maybe, with busy schedules and occasions to celebrate, each meal is weighed down with all the baggage of being a Big Deal.

        "Princeton University said Monday that it will keep President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s name on its school of public and international affairs and a residential college despite calls to expunge his name from those institutions on the Ivy League campus because of his staunch support of racial segregation. But the university\u2019s board of trustees pledged to take steps to expand Princeton\u2019s commitment to diversity and inclusion and to be transparent \u201cin recognizing Wilson\u2019s failings and shortcomings as well as the visions and achievements that led to the naming of the school and the college in the first place.",

The Associated Press called the race for both men within an hour of polls closing at 9 p. m. Eastern time. In both races, the result meant a defeat for the party\u2019s national \u2014 although the loss may be more damaging to Republican Donald Trump, because he is in greater danger of failing to lock up the party\u2019s nomination ahead of this summer\u2019s convention.",

        "President Obama made a forceful case Tuesday for stopping corporations from moving their headquarters overseas to avoid U.

        "My former colleagues on the New York Daily News editorial board sat down with Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) on April 1 for an illuminating interview. The more I read the transcript, the more it became clear that the candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination doesn\u2019t know much beyond his standard stump speech about breaking up the banks and how he had the good judgment to vote against the Iraq War in 2002.

        "If the polls are right, Ted Cruz will win today\u2019s Wisconsin primary. That won\u2019t make it any more likely that Cruz could get a majority of Republican delegates (which is far out of reach for him) but it will make it less likely that Donald Trump will manage to win outright; most current projections show him falling just a bit short of the 1, 237 delegates he needs.

        "It would be impossible to implement. It\u2019s unconstitutional. It\u2019s an insult to voters\u2019 intelligence. These objections apply to most of Donald Trump\u2019s ideas, including his latest scheme. The Post reports: Donald Trump says he will force Mexico to pay for a border wall as president by threatening to cut off the flow of billions of dollars in payments that immigrants send home to the country, an idea that could decimate the Mexican economy and set up an unprecedented showdown between the United States and a key diplomatic ally. . . .",
