        "MEXICO CITY \u2014 The rise of Donald Trump and the wave he is riding in his presidential primary campaign have alarmed the Mexican government so much that it has reshuffled top diplomats and, according to officials, adopted a new strategy \u2014 to defend the image of Mexicans abroad.

        "The Allergan announced early Wednesday it would abandon its with U.

The Treasury Department released new regulations Monday to stem the tide of such inversions, and Pfizer and Allergan spent two days scrambling to determine whether their merger still made financial sense.",
