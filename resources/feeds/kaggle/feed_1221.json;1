        "West Virginia looks perfect for Donald Trump: a struggling state filled with the types of voters who have backed him elsewhere and could deliver one of his biggest victories. But a sweep there might not matter. That\u2019s because as many as 34 delegates \u2014 the entire contingent \u2014 may be free to back whomever they want at the Republican National Convention. Much the same is true in Pennsylvania, home to a hotly contested April 26 primary, where there are 57 uncommitted delegates. Other states and territories, from Colorado to Wyoming to Guam, will also send squads of unbound representatives.",

        "Last week, I posted a disturbing video of a 2014 traffic stop in Aiken, S. C. in which a black couple were pulled over by a white police officer without cause. By the end of the stop, deputies had searched the couple\u2019s car, searched the woman\u2019s body, and according to the audio, appear to have performed a cavity search on the man. The video shows no reasonable suspicion for any of the searches. The officers found no illicit drugs.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: Has Sanders tacitly joined the \u201cBernie or Bust\u201d movement? Could he somehow try to imperil Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances in a general election by doing less than what is necessary to try to swing his national following \u2014 particularly young voters \u2014 behind Clinton, if she wins the nomination? Nah. I just can\u2019t see it.",
        "Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, is on the board of directors of the National Rifle Association and the Parental Rights Organization. Democrats have approached the 2016 presidential election with great confidence, arguing that changing demographics will guarantee them victory. By this, they mean the growing number of African Americans, Hispanics and Asian Americans expected to vote in November. However, other dramatic changes in the electorate over the past 30 years give Republican candidates an advantage.",
        "Free trade agreements \u201chave been disastrous\u201d for the United States, the candidate said, and have sent jobs to Mexico and China. \u201cI will stop it by renegotiating all of the trade agreements that we have. \u201d It sounded like just another threat from Donald Trump to \u201crip up those trade deals\u201d and \u201cmake really good ones\u201d instead. Such a policy could set off a global trade war and impoverish millions. But the candidate who said this was Bernie Sanders, April 1 in New York. And that\u2019s no coincidence: He and Trump are peas in a pod.",
        "This time they did it. After several unsuccessful attempts to land an unmanned rocket on a football floating platform in the Atlantic Ocean, Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX finally pulled off the dramatic feat Friday afternoon in its first launch to resupply the International Space Station since its rocket exploded last year. The landing, the first ever of a rocket\u2019s first stage at sea, was heralded as a breakthrough for the burgeoning commercial spaceflight industry, and its leader, SpaceX. \u201cIt\u2019s another step toward the stars.",
        "If Bernie Sanders were someone other than a secular Jewish democratic socialist, it might be thought of as a \u201cHail Mary\u201d moment for him. The senator from Vermont has decided to step off the campaign trail for two crucial days before what could be a primary in New York to attend a conference on income inequality at the Vatican. Polls show him with a deficit against Hillary Clinton, and Sanders desperately needs a strong showing in the April 19 primary if he wants to chip away at her delegate lead.",
        "He called for divorced and remarried Catholics to participate more fully in church life. But he closed the door on gay marriage. He quotes Jorge Luis Borges and Jesus Christ. There is an entire chapter on love. But more than anything, Pope Francis\u2019s document on family life, released Friday by the Vatican, amounts to an exultation of traditional marriage while recognizing that life, in his own words, isn\u2019t always \u201cperfect. \u201d Yet rather than judging, he commanded, the church should be a pillar of support.",
        "Robert James O\u2019Neill, the former member of SEAL Team 6 who claimed to have shot and killed leader Osama bin Laden in a 2011 raid, was charged with DUI on Friday in his home town of Butte, Mont. According to George Skuletich, the undersheriff of Bow City and County, local officers responded to the parking lot of a local convenience store after multiple complaints of a man sleeping in the front seat of his car with the engine running. The officers recognized O\u2019Neill, 39, and proceeded to wake him.",
        "The suicide bomber who blew up a youth soccer match late last month left barely a dent in the hard, dry earth, and only a faint scorch on a concrete wall nearby. But he gouged a chasm of grief in the heart of the small community that lost more than two dozen of its sons in a single moment, at 6:15 on the evening of March 25. A total of 43 people died in the bombing at the game, according to figures provided by the local government.",
        "As tributes to the late Merle Haggard continue to roll in, one anecdote keeps coming up: That time Haggard was an inmate at San Quentin and saw Johnny Cash perform one of his famous prison concerts. Haggard devotees often point to that as a turning point for the country music star.",
        "The wife of a member of the KKK at a gathering for a BBQ and cross ritual in Maryland. (Peter van Photos) The Ku Klux Klan is the oldest and most hate group in the United States. At one point, during its heyday, the Klan boasted a membership of around 4 million. That number has greatly dwindled, with the Southern Poverty and Law Center putting current numbers between 8, 000 and 10, 000. Despite their fewer numbers, the KKK has seen some recent exposure in mainstream society, most notably during this campaign season.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 Leaders of Donald Trump\u2019s new campaign team said they have revised targets that would make the real estate mogul the presumptive Republican presidential nominee by and that would win him the delegates needed to clinch the nomination before the party\u2019s convention this summer.",
        "COLORADO SPRINGS \u2014 Donald Trump still leads the Republican presidential race, but Ted Cruz continues to beat him at a trickier game: securing convention delegates in states that don\u2019t hold caucuses or primaries. Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, Sen. Bernie Sanders failed to make any headway in his delegate deficit, despite winning Saturday\u2019s caucuses in Wyoming. The events in neighboring states underscored the unpredictability of the race for the delegates who will choose the presidential nominees.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders won the Wyoming caucuses on Saturday, continuing a winning streak against Hillary Clinton as the two head for a key showdown next week in New York. The senator from Vermont has now defeated Clinton in the past seven of eight states that have held nominating contests. However, Sanders\u2019s margin of victory, which stood at 55. 7 percent to 44. 3 percent with all precincts reporting, provided no help in his larger quest to catch Clinton in the race for the nomination.",
        "CARL BERNSTEIN has a favorite shot \u2014 a powerful, wordless visual within a film rippling with verbiage. It is the moment when everything elevates as metaphor. It is, Bernstein says, \u201cthe Library of Congress shot. \u201d The film is \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d Alan J. Pakula\u2019s classic journalism procedural, which today celebrates the 40th anniversary of its release. And the shot in question begins with a tight overhead of The Washington Post\u2019s Watergate reporters, Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) and Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) as they painstakingly thumb through thousands of the library\u2019s circulation file cards.",
        "PARIS \u2014 The Belgian federal prosecutor confirmed Saturday that Mohamed Abrini \u2014 who was arrested Friday afternoon \u2014 was the \u201cman in the hat\u201d captured in surveillance footage alongside two suicide bombers at Brussels Airport on March 22. Abrini had been at large since the Brussels attacks, which killed 32 and injured hundreds more at the airport in Zaventem and a metro station close to the headquarters of the European Union. Footage showed him calmly walking out of the airport and into the city, where he disappeared.",
        "Melissa J. showed up in my court last year with four kids in tow. Her children quietly watched from a nearby table while I spoke with her. The charges against her \u2014 driving with an invalid license, driving without insurance, not wearing a seat belt, failure to use a child safety seat properly and four failures to appear \u2014 were nothing unusual for municipal court. Nor were her fines of several thousand dollars.",
        "Last month, the Utah House of Representatives became the first legislative body in the United States to pass a resolution declaring pornography \u201ca public health hazard leading to a broad spectrum of individual and public health impacts and societal harms. \u201d The liberal backlash criticized the measure as an antiquated bit of conservative moralizing, with the Daily Beast calling it \u201chypocritical\u201d and \u201c . \u201d \u201cThe science just isn\u2019t there,\u201d wrote Rewire, an online journal dedicated to dispelling \u201cfalsehoods and misinformation.",

The distance from my church to my office at the Pentagon was just over five miles. But for most of my time in government, it might as well have been 5, 000. On Sunday mornings, I prayed for peace. \u201cJesus was a homeless refugee from the Middle East,\u201d my minister reminded us once before announcing our Advent offering.",
        "I always knew that watching \u201cSpotlight\u201d was going to be difficult for me, so I kept putting it off. Finally, with my wife out of town last week, I sprawled on the floor with my two big dogs and steeled myself to view the film about the investigation of sexual abuse in Boston\u2019s Catholic Church. I was glad Patricia was away. I didn\u2019t want her to see my tears.",
        "Expanded trade with China over the past 15 years has cost the United States at least 2 million jobs. Cracking down on trade with China, by taxing the cheap consumer goods it ships to our store shelves, could cost millions of additional jobs. That both of these things can be true is the conundrum of trade, the breakout issue of the 2016 presidential election. Democrats have long debated globalization and its consequences in their primary campaigns, particularly in the Rust Belt, a tradition Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are continuing.",

        "Federal prosecutors on Friday detailed some of the lurid allegations of sexual misconduct against former U. S. House speaker Dennis Hastert and asked a federal judge to subject the Illinois Republican to a sex offender evaluation. In a memo in advance of an April 27 sentencing hearing, prosecutors spelled out in graphic detail how Hastert sexually molested or inappropriately touched five teenagers who trusted him as their wrestling coach. And as Hastert rose to power, believing that his wrongdoing would never be made public, his victims struggled with the effects of the abuse, prosecutors wrote.",
        "Tuesday was a very good night for Bernie Sanders. He beat Hillary Clinton in the Wisconsin primary. That win should have been a springboard for Sanders heading into the New York primary on April 19. It wasn\u2019t. Here\u2019s why. First, Sanders did an interview with the editorial board of the New York Daily News. In the discussion, a transcript of which was posted on Monday, Sanders came across as the proverbial dog who caught the car.",
        "On the face of it, the Panama Papers don\u2019t look good for Russia. Reporters investigating the huge leak of financial data from a Panamanian legal firm have suggested that up to $2 billion in offshore bank accounts could be linked to a circle of friends closely associated with President Vladimir Putin. For many, this information seems to corroborate what has long been rumored: that Putin is corrupt, on a huge scale. After a few days of silence, the Russian president himself has taken aim at the allegations, suggesting they were part of a broader U. S.",

        "They had no choice but to swim. The three men had left just hours earlier when a large wave capsized their skiff on Monday night. They swam through two miles of dark water before finding salvation: the tiny Pacific Island of Fanadik, several hundred miles north of Papua New Guinea. Three days after their boat capsized near a remote island, three men were rescued by a U. S. Navy plane that had spotted the sign they made on the shore. (U. S.

They settle along the Atlantic Coast after wintering in the Caribbean and nest in divots in the sand \u2014 what\u2019s left of it, anyway. Coastal development has contributed to the bird\u2019s decline, and it\u2019s considered threatened by the federal government and endangered by the state of New York.
