        "LAS VEGAS \u2014 It was Final Four weekend, and James Riviello was in a mood to make some serious money. The professional gambler sat in a puffy tan leather chair inside the mammoth Westgate Casino sports book, a realm the size of a Costco warehouse, with eight super screens showing his favorite sport in colorful . Here in the place known as Sin City, where vice normally calls the shots, there was something refreshing about the scene. You could almost call it healthy. Nobody was smoking.",
        "Every renovation project is inherently optimistic, because homeowners start out with a plan to improve their home with visions of glorious new living spaces or at least a shiny updated bathroom galvanizing them to power through the less pleasant side of home improvement projects. While most people come through the mess and expense and enjoy the results, the biggest fear of many homeowners is that they will be among the unhappy group who suffer from inflated costs, workmanship or an incomplete renovation.",

        "On a rainy February afternoon, the ionic charge is palpable in Michelle Francl\u2019s physical chemistry class at Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia. As Francl scribbles a mathematical equation for wave function that\u2019s projected on an overhead screen, students twirl ponytails, peck at keyboards and peek at their smartphones.

        "Because I live in Paris part time, and because that time is never the same from year to year, I\u2019ve gotten to see the markets in every season. I\u2019ve been there when the fragrance of strawberries can make you dizzy, when the stalls are piled with poultry in full plumage (a Christmas favorite) when all there is that\u2019s \u201cfresh\u201d is potatoes, when there are so many varieties of apples that you need to shop with a botanist, and when, just about now, asparagus spears are arranged in pyramids so tall it\u2019s impossible to see the vendor behind them.",

        "NEW YORK \u2014 No group of voters has been more loyal to Hillary Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary than black voters. Yet she and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, spent an entire day courting black voters in half a dozen New York churches and at a campaign event in Baltimore. Why? The effort comes after a week in which the long relationship between African American voters and the Clintons needed some reinforcements. \u201dThis is a historic day,\u201d said Rep. Charles B.

As partisanship and jockeying for electoral advantage become Congress refuses to do its job, while the White House reaches perilously toward doing Congress\u2019s job as well as its own.

        "Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk on Sunday announced his resignation, calling for the formation of a new government as Kiev endures its worst political crisis since the \u201cEuromaidan\u201d revolution of 2014. The public\u2019s patience has grown thin with Yatsenyuk, as well as with President Petro Poroshenko, because of a struggling economy, stalled reforms and entrenched corruption. The ruling coalition has fractured as public support hits new lows. As Western leaders have openly signaled their exasperation with the political logjam in Kiev, the choice of Yatsenyuk\u2019s replacement is seen as a bellwether for the fate of Ukraine\u2019s stalled reform program.",

But more than 25 years ago, the two women found themselves in the same position: freshmen in college, pregnant and scared of derailing all they had worked toward. Both women, on a day each recalls vividly, walked into a Dallas abortion clinic.

        "One of the things about writing a book about zombies is that it becomes kind of necessary to keep up on the genre. In the five years since \u201cTheories of International Politics and Zombies\u201d came out, this wasn\u2019t too much of a burden: Read the occasional prestige zombie novel, watch the occasional bastardized film version of a zombie novel and watch \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d on AMC. As that show\u2019s ratings have exploded, however, there has been the inevitable proliferation of and homages, including AMC\u2019s \u201cFear the Walking Dead\u201d and the CW\u2019s \u201ciZombie.",
        "Editor\u2019s note: This column has been updated since publication.

It\u2019s true, as Sanders says, that a number of polls show him performing better against them in general election though the significance of this is an open question. This argument from Sanders, however, is crucial to understanding this new ad from Hillary Clinton that attacks Donald Trump by name, going hard directly at Trump\u2019s xenophobia, demagoguery and chauvinism.",
        "In a recent Washington Post op ed, prominent attorney and Common Cause board member Gregory Diskant argues that, if the Senate refuses to vote on the nomination, President Obama can simply appoint Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court without getting him confirmed by the Senate at all. Diskant contends that failure to act on a nomination constitutes a \u201cwaiver\u201d of the Senate\u2019s confirmation power: In most respects, the meaning of the \u201cAdvice and Consent\u201d clause is obvious. The Senate can always grant or withhold consent by voting on the nominee."
