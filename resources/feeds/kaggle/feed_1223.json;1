        "The night Donald Trump notched his first win as a presidential candidate, he took the stage in New Hampshire between Ivanka and Melania and lit into the special interests that he declared had corrupted Washington \u2014 the company town that Trump, marketer extraordinaire, has ruthlessly trashed to the benefit of his own brand. \u201cThese are lobbyists, these are people that don\u2019t necessarily love our country,\u201d said Trump. \u201cWe have to stop it. We have to stop it. \u201d Over Trump\u2019s shoulder, another man licked his teeth and flattened his lips into a straight line.",
        "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. \u2014 Bigelow Aerospace\u2019s expandable space habitat just arrived at the International Space Station, but the company is already thinking about the next steps: flying even larger inflatable habitats into space to be used for research and even space hotels. The company announced at a conference here Monday that starting in 2020 the United Launch Alliance, the joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, would deliver the habitats to space, where they would orbit the Earth more than a couple hundred miles high.",
        "Duane R. \u201cDewey\u201d Clarridge, a CIA operative and official of dash, daring and swagger who helped establish and headed the agency\u2019s counterterrorism center and also was known for his connection to the affair of the 1980s, died April 9 at his home in Leesburg, Va. He was 83. The cause was cancer, his family said in a statement. Over the years, Mr. Clarridge\u2019s career, replete with secret missions, covert meetings and dealings at the edge of legality embodied much of the activities associated in the popular imagination with the shadow world of intelligence, and its art, craft and mystique.",
        "It was going to be an El Ni\u00f1o to end all El Ni\u00f1os. The warmest ocean temperature anomalies on record blossomed in its core, the largest area of exceptionally warm water ever seen in the tropical Pacific. The California drought was death watch \u2014 it would bring \u201cone storm after another like a conveyor belt. \u201d It was named Godzilla. And now it\u2019s dead. RIP, Godzilla El Ni\u00f1o. Over the past few weeks, the equatorial Pacific has been cooling.",
        "Sandy Stark always loved pretty things. When she was a girl, she collected unusual rocks, birds\u2019 nests, crooked sticks and dolls. As an adult, she gravitated to white ceramics and china, paperweights, kitchenware and art. Year by year, the treasures accumulated until the only way she could navigate her San Francisco apartment was through a narrow line of what she called \u201cgoat paths. \u201d That was when her two grown daughters swooped in and cleaned the place out. All her treasures, gone. On reentering her house, seeing it so sterile, so empty, Stark, now 71, says she felt traumatized.",
        "Edwin Ordo\u00f1ez was 9 years old when he and his father swam across the Rio Grande and slipped into this country, the final leg of a long and risky journey from their native El Salvador. Edwin spoke no English, but he was smart, determined and focused on his education. Nine years after arriving in the United States, he is a standout student poised to graduate as valedictorian of the District\u2019s Bell Multicultural High School. But his impending graduation \u2014 and his quest for higher education and a better life \u2014 opened another grueling journey in the past six months.",
        "The shooting death of former Saints defensive end Will Smith left one of New Orleans\u2019 residents searching for reasons for Smith\u2019s death and solutions for the violence. \u201cThe problem is New Orleans perennially is way up in these homicides statistically,\u201d Drew Brees, the New Orleans Saints quarterback who was Smith\u2019s teammate for seven seasons, told MMQB\u2019s Peter King. \u201cWe become desensitized to it.",
        "It\u2019s but the line still spills out the front door, snaking around the block, eating up the better part of the sidewalk, as it has since early that morning. There are young couples, clinging to each other in the cold. Mothers, standing patiently next to their anxious children. There are teenage girls, chatting in packs. And there are SLR cameras \u2014 so many SLR cameras. \u201dWhat are you all waiting for?\u201d a passerby who lives in the neighborhood asks as she plucks an earphone out from one of her ears. She is looking at the crowd with amazement.",
        "The FBI cracked a San Bernardino terrorist\u2019s phone with the help of professional hackers who discovered and brought to the bureau at least one previously unknown software flaw, according to people familiar with the matter. The new information was then used to create a piece of hardware that helped the FBI to crack the iPhone\u2019s personal identification number without triggering a security feature that would have erased all the data, the individuals said. The researchers, who typically keep a low profile, specialize in hunting for vulnerabilities in software and then in some cases selling them to the U. S.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 John Kasich gave a sweeping address here Tuesday that the Ohio governor hoped would reframe the presidential race in his favor. Speaking in midtown Manhattan just five blocks from Trump Tower, Kasich summoned Republican voters to reject the billionaire and instead nominate an experienced hand who, in a spirit of bipartisan comity, could solve Washington\u2019s in trac table problems.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 For days now, Bill Clinton has been attempting to extricate himself from a confrontation with Black Lives Matter protesters, trying both to hold to his position and step back from it. It\u2019s been an awkward dance. But it speaks to a broader problem for the 42nd president of the United States. Clinton is caught in a time warp, having to grapple with how much the era in which he served, the events that occurred then and the actions he took as president have been reinterpreted and, by many in his own party, rejected.",
        "We\u2019ve seen it before: A Hollywood actor finds a cause, jets to Washington for a photo op and a handshake, makes a speech and flies home. This is a story about a Hollywood actor who found a cause, then jetted to Washington, then moved to Washington, then got a job at a nonprofit group in Washington and then one morning found herself having meetings at the Pentagon, where some of the other attendees had no idea who she was. Her name is Melissa Fitzgerald. She was on \u201cThe West Wing. \u201d She played \u2014 well, we\u2019ll get to that.",
        "\u201cGet out! Leftist scum! Get out!\u201d In the video, the bearded white man wears a black shirt and a red baseball cap with the words \u201cMake America Great Again. \u201d He is yelling at a young black woman. He shoves her once, then again, screaming at her to leave. The crowd around him is agitated. Others push the woman as well. Many are yelling. There had been clashes between supporters and protesters at Donald Trump rallies before, but this one in Louisville last month stood out. The racial imagery was jarring, the violence only barely contained.",
        "When life gives you lemons, the saying goes, make lemonade. And what if life gives Democrats lemonade? Well, they\u2019ll try to sell it to hurrying commuters outside. On a cool morning. In a downpour. Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation\u2019s capital. He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000.",
        "During my junior year of college, the history department awarded me with an academic scholarship and invited me to celebrate by having lunch with the head of the department. I was excited about the scholarship but was especially excited to meet with the professor who would be hosting the lunch. It all went very well until I asked him about the historical significance of my political hero. \u201cHow will academics remember Ronald Reagan?\u201d I inquired breathlessly. He paused for a moment and chose his words carefully.",
        "Any marginally aware citizen is familiar with what I like to call the Four Pillars of Conservatism: low taxes, small government, strong defense, and traditional values. The simplicity and clarity of these ideas allows any Republican anywhere to move into politics with a ideological program, and as long as they stay abstract, it\u2019s reasonably popular. It\u2019s only when you start to get into specifics that the agenda becomes problematic. The trick is that if you\u2019re proposing something unpopular, to speak about it in the most abstract terms possible.",
        "Politicians like to bet that reporters and their pesky questions will go away. Too often, they\u2019re right. Thus, the drumbeat of demands for Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns faded after he waved it all away with claims that a pending audit prevented the transparency he would otherwise be delighted to provide. With Trump\u2019s demurral, so, too, subsided requests for a fuller accounting from the other remaining presidential candidates. Aside from Hillary Clinton, they have been unprecedentedly parsimonious with tax information. Ruth Marcus is a columnist for The Post, specializing in American politics and domestic policy.",
        "EASTON, Md. It\u2019s been a long while since South Carolina could look down upon its neighbor to the North. Thanks to North Carolina\u2019s legislation (HB2) also referred to as the \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d the state effectively has begun redefining itself from its characterization as a \u201cvale of humility between two mountains of conceit\u201d (South Carolina and Virginia). The new law, which ludicrously requires transgender people to use the restroom consistent with the sex on their birth certificates, has liberated South Carolina from its persistent place as the brunt of jokes. Remarking on the law, South Carolina Gov.",
        "AN OPPOSITION victory in parliamentary elections in December gave Venezuela a fragile opportunity to arrest what has been an accelerating spiral toward an economic and political crash. Had it chosen to accommodate and negotiate with opposition leaders, the deeply unpopular government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro might have been able to ease mounting political tensions and build consensus around desperately needed economic stabilization measures. It was urged to pursue this course by the Obama administration and most Latin American governments, with the notable exception of its closest ally, Cuba.",
        "North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) responded to a backlash against the state\u2019s new law banning protections for gay and transgender people by signing an executive order Tuesday aimed at calming the firestorm, even as he left the most controversial provisions intact. McCrory said he was expanding protections for state employees, which would prevent these workers from being fired for being gay or transgender. He also said he would seek legislation restoring the right to sue for discrimination.",
        "It\u2019s not every day that a state\u2019s top prosecutor takes legal action against the state\u2019s governor, which makes what\u2019s happening in Kentucky so interesting. Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear (D) has filed a lawsuit to stop Gov. Matt Bevin (R) from slashing the budgets of the state\u2019s public colleges and universities. Beshear says the governor violated state laws governing budget reductions when he imposed a $41 million, or 4. 5 percent, spending cut in the last three months of the fiscal year.",
        "President Obama\u2019s push to get Merrick B. Garland confirmed to the Supreme Court has won a boost from 15 former presidents of the American Bar Association, who called on Senate leaders in a Monday letter to take action on Garland\u2019s nomination. Their call came as Garland began a new round of private meetings with key Republican senators Tuesday \u2014 starting with a highly anticipated breakfast with the man who controls whether he will get a confirmation hearing, Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley ( ).",
        "When famed astrophysicist Stephen Hawking and Russian tech tycoon Yuri Milner announced a $100 million hunt for alien life last year, they pledged to inject a whole lot of funding and brain power into the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. At a press conference on Tuesday, the duo announced another $100 million moonshot \u2014 or more accurately a starshot. It\u2019s the latest project of the Breakthrough Prize Foundation, a Silicon group that currently gives the biggest prizes of any scientific award. The 2015 initiative (which is still ongoing) focused on the detection of planets and alien signals.",
        "The Flint, Mich. water system is in much better shape six months after the city switched its water source and began adding chemicals to control corrosion of aging pipes, but the threat of lead contamination remains, researchers said Tuesday. \u201cThere are very positive trends. . .. The system is definitely on its path to recovery,\u201d Marc Edwards, the Virginia Tech professor whose work helped bring Flint\u2019s water crisis to light, told reporters. But he said that because recent samples showed that potentially dangerous levels of lead persist, \u201cat present, no one should be drinking unfiltered water in Flint.",
        "Growing up in Lowell, Mass. in the 1950s and \u201960s, Andrea Hoffman learned about the Holocaust at Hebrew school, and later married into a family that included Holocaust survivors. Along the way, certain questions haunted her. \u201cI\u2019ve always wondered what people knew, when did they know it, how did they know it?\u201d said Hoffman, 65.",
        "The man in the orange vest appeared in Mike Willcox\u2019s back yard without warning. By the time family members inside his Kingwood, Tex. home noticed the random figure striding past the backyard pool, it was too late. A large metal pipe wrench was already raised above the man\u2019s head and he was swinging it wildly at the Willcox family\u2019s two dogs. Willcox\u2019s terrified son watched the March 23 incident unfold a few feet away in the living room, Wilcox told CBS affiliate KHOU.",
        "In his 2012 book \u201dComing Apart,\u201d conservative writer Charles Murray argues that America\u2019s upper class has fallen out of touch with mainstream (white) culture. Murray calls this insular group \u201celites,\u201d but a better term might be \u201cfancy people. \u201d Fancy people drink wine instead of cheap beer; they watch auteur shows like \u201dMad Men\u201d and \u201dTrue Detective.\u201d Fancy people get married later and have kids later; they buy fresh produce at Whole Foods and exercise to stay trim. And many of them pile into exclusive Zip codes where these habits are the norm.",
        "I remember the day when you called me early in the morning saying that you wanted to divorce my dad. \u00c2 The simple, declarative nature of this caption (for the picture above) belies a whirlwind of confusion and upheaval that became Daria Klimasheva s life soon after. \u00c2 She was 15 years old and the divorce unleashed something like a seasonal depression in her mother, a disease unknown to Klimasheva. I was trying to become a mom for my mom and it felt wrong, ?",
        "Federal prosecutors were counting on the testimony of a powerful political fundraiser to help prove that former D. C. mayor Vincent C. Gray knew about an illegal shadow campaign that helped pay for his bid to win the city\u2019s highest office. But the investigation of Gray\u2019s role was delayed, and possibly aborted, because of concerns about Jeffrey E. Thompson\u2019s credibility, recent interviews and new records show. Investigators last year began asking questions about the ages of Thompson\u2019s sexual partners to determine whether he had committed a crime, according to witnesses who spoke to federal agents and The Washington Post.",
        "The Democratic Party and the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders will sue the state of Arizona over voter access to the polls after the state\u2019s presidential primary last month left thousands of residents waiting as long as five hours to vote. The lawsuit, which will be filed on Friday, focuses on Maricopa County, the state\u2019s most populous county, where voters faced the longest lines on March 22 during the Democratic and Republican primaries after the county cut the number of polling places by 85 percent since 2008."
