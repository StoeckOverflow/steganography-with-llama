        "The snippets of music were almost an afterthought. They were meant to be brief interludes between segments on NPR\u2019s signature news program, \u201cAll Things Considered. \u201d For years, the show\u2019s director, Bob Boilen, filled the pockets of dead air with songs he loved. His tastes veered toward the quirky and the obscure. What was that song? listeners began to ask. So he started an online show called \u201cAll Songs Considered,\u201d a place where he could share his musical finds. \u201cI felt the responsibility, with all this music I was getting, to get the word out,\u201d he says.",
        "As most states have moved to new standardized tests based on the Common Core during the past two years, many also have switched from administering those tests the way \u2014 with paper and No. 2 pencils \u2014 to delivering them online using computers, laptops and tablets. The transition aims to harness the power of technology to move beyond simplistic questions, using interactive questions and adaptive techniques to measure students\u2019 critical thinking and skills.",
        "Having recently discovered how the nomination process works in the Republican Party, Donald Trump is furious. \u201cThey wanted to keep people out,\u201d he bellowed. \u201cThis is a dirty trick. \u201d In fact, Mr. Trump is right on the first count and wrong on the second. Political parties do have mechanisms to \u201ckeep people out. \u201d But far from being a trick, they are the crux of what makes parties valuable in a democracy. Clinton Rossiter begins his classic book \u201cParties and Politics in America\u201d with this declaration: \u201cNo America without democracy, no democracy without politics, no politics without parties.",
        "James Downie is The Post\u2019s digital opinions editor. One of the great ironies of the American political process in the 21st century is the Democratic Party superdelegate. On campaign finance reform and voting rights, the party fights to give regular Americans more of a voice. Yet when it comes to choosing a presidential nominee, it\u2019s the Democrats, not the Republicans, who give 712 party insiders roughly the same influence as 5. 5 million ordinary voters in Texas, Florida, Ohio and Michigan. And for the second contested presidential primary in a row, these superdelegates are playing an important role.",
        "Welcome to Donald Trump\u2019s banana republic. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have protests, demonstrations,\u201d says Trump surrogate and confidante Roger Stone. \u201cWe will disclose the hotels and the room numbers of those delegates who are directly involved in the steal. If you\u2019re from Pennsylvania, we\u2019ll tell you who the culprits are. We urge you to visit their hotel and find them. \u201d This is the version of a counterpunch. Lose in a process you\u2019ve known about for a year but didn\u2019t prepare for. Respond with brutish threats of mayhem and personal harm.",
        "THERE HAS been a fair amount of chortling over the fact that two of Donald Trump\u2019s children won\u2019t be able to vote for him in New York\u2019s upcoming presidential primary. Their failure to register as Republicans may indeed, as his delighted critics were quick to point out, be another sign of Mr. Trump running a campaign. But their disenfranchisement is also indicative of the needless barriers that prevent far too many people from casting ballots. That is no laughing matter. Ivanka and Eric Trump ran afoul of New York\u2019s overly restrictive voting laws.",
        "The Citadel is considering a request from an admitted student that she be allowed to wear a hijab in keeping with her Muslim faith, a move that would be an unprecedented exception to the school\u2019s longstanding uniform requirements. If the request for the traditional Muslim hair covering is granted, it apparently would be the first exception made to the Citadel\u2019s uniform, which all cadets at the storied public military college in South Carolina are required to wear at nearly all times.",
        "When the District sends its $13 billion budget to Congress this year, it might as well affix a sticky note that reads \u201cDare you. \u201d For the first time since the Founding Fathers carved out the nation\u2019s capital from swampland, the District will not ask the federal government for permission to spend its money. Instead, it will use local tax dollars as it sees fit, just as 50 states do. There is one problem \u2014 Congress treats the District as a federal agency, no different from the way it funds the Department of Labor or the Interior.",
        "Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam on Thursday vetoed a bill that would have made the Bible the state\u2019s official book. \u201cIn addition to the constitutional issues with the bill, my personal feeling is that this bill trivializes the Bible, which I believe is a sacred text,\u201d Haslam (R) wrote in a letter to the speaker of the statehouse. \u201cIf we believe that the Bible is the inspired word of God, then we shouldn\u2019t be recognizing it only as a book of historical and economic significance,\u201d continued Haslam.",
        "Medically assisted suicide would be a legal choice for some dying Canadians under legislation introduced Thursday by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government. The proposed law would apply to dying patients \u201dsuffering intolerably from a serious medical condition,\u201d according to a news release. The Associated Press reported that the proposed law would apply only to Canadians and permanent residents of the country. That means \u201dsuicide tourism\u201d to Canada would not be an option, because tourists would not be eligible for legal, medically assisted suicide, according to the news agency.",
        "\u201cMy name is Eric Walton,\u201d the teenager said, standing center stage at the April 2 Tedx Boise event. \u201cAt the age of 13 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after my mom wrote a slightly unimportant blog post that went viral on the internet. \u2026 She said that she was the mother of a child with a mental illness. A few days later I got the diagnosis.",
        "The Mauritania, Dec. 2, 1918. (Library of Congress) Sinking an enemy ship once had an air of decorum. When World War I erupted, rules of engagement said that the crew of a would board a cornered ship and offload passengers safely before sending it to slumber on the ocean bed. But German submarines had become a major threat to the might of the previously dominant British Royal Navy, and neither side could afford niceties. Unterseeboots were terrifyingly good at avoiding detection and were armed with torpedoes \u2014 which they weren\u2019t afraid to use. The British fleet was bleeding.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 Tensions between the Republican Party and its own erupted into a public battle as top party officials rebuked Donald Trump on Friday for alleging that the GOP primary system was \u201crigged\u201d against him. The dispute, which has been simmering for days, centers on Trump\u2019s failure to win any delegates last weekend in Colorado, which selected its 34 delegates at a party convention rather than a primary attended by voters. All went to Trump\u2019s chief rival, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.",
        "When the Republican foreign policy elite gets together these days, conversation quickly veers from challenges such as the Islamic State or North Korea to focus on two questions. How has Donald Trump come so close to becoming the party\u2019s ? If Trump were elected president, would any of them serve in his administration? \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing we can talk about,\u201d said Eliot Cohen, professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University and a former George W. Bush administration official. He\u2019s answered the second question by spearheading an petition, which now has signatures of 121 GOP national security experts.",
        "To taste a Cronut \u2014 an actual, legit Cronut \u2014 you must be willing to brave the sea of humanity that amasses each morning outside Dominique Ansel Bakery in Manhattan. You can also go to a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts in pretty much any city and order something that\u2019s kind of like Ansel\u2019s iconic pastry, cut from croissant dough and then deep fried. Or, in Sacramento, you could have a Doissant. In San Francisco, you can scarf down a Cruffin, which is not a doughnut at all, but hey, close enough.",
        "This weekend, 13 countries with little in common will attempt to act as one \u2014 by coming to an agreement to curb oil production and prop up prices. But the quarrelling members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, who meet Sunday in Doha, Qatar, have been acting less like a cartel and more like observers to a free market in crude oil. And the odds of the group reaching anything more than a fragile agreement to \u201cfreeze\u201d output at current levels are slim. Given the nature of the cartel, it\u2019s no wonder.",
        "The 1862 act authorizing the freeing of all slaves in our nation\u2019s capital was received with great joy among the city\u2019s abolitionists and enslaved blacks. That Emancipation Day event is being celebrated this weekend in Washington. Probably no one in 1862, however, could have been more ecstatic than George Washington Young, who lived in the Southeast section of the District. Unlike the joyful slaves, Young was not gaining his freedom. He was a planter. Young was euphoric because he was going to make out like a bandit. Colbert I. \u201cColby\u201d King writes a column sometimes about D. C.",
        "Nathan Christensen is an adjunct professor at Lewis & Clark Law School in Portland, Ore. Last month, President Obama returned from Cuba, where he took another step toward normalizing relations with the island nation. In his speech to the Cuban people, the president made the case that engagement is a more powerful agent of change than isolation, even where strong disagreements remain. With his visit, the president continued to chip away at the U. S. trade embargo against Cuba. Two days later, Ed Lee, the mayor of San Francisco, laid the foundation for a new embargo.",
        "Kareem is an author, commentator and former professional basketball player. There is a tradition in U. S. politics of somberly proclaiming that each election is The Most Important in History. The idea, of course, is to scare people into voting for some candidate or another. This is done by describing an apocalyptic future like some sadistic camp counselor telling horror stories at bedtime with a flashlight under his chin.",
        "When President Obama departs for Saudi Arabia, an incubator of the attacks, he will leave behind a dispute about government secrecy. The suppression of 28 pages, first from a public congressional inquiry and then from the 2004 report by the Commission, has spared the Saudis embarrassment, which would be mild punishment for complicity in 2, 977 murders. When Obama returns, he should keep his promise to release the pages. Then he should further curtail senseless secrecy by countermanding the CIA s refusal to release its official history of the 1961 Bay of Pigs debacle.",
        "Jacob Leggette\u2019s mother said his childhood has been characterized by impatience. He was grabbing at his father\u2019s iPad as a toddler. At 8, he tried out a printer at Digital Harbor Foundation, which has youth technology programs near his home in Baltimore, and decided he had to have one. Not content to wait for Santa Claus, he began writing letters to printer companies urging them to give him a free printer in exchange for writing reviews of their products.",
        "(Bill O\u2019 Washington Post) President Obama and the first lady reported a combined income of $436, 065 on their 2015 tax returns, nearly a 10 percent dip from the previous year and the lowest amount since the president took office. The Obamas paid $81, 472 in taxes, for a federal tax rate of 18. 7 percent, the White House reported Friday in its annual disclosure. The federal income tax filing deadline is Monday. The first familymade about $41, 000 more in 2014, but the Obamas\u2019 income has fallen since peaking early in his tenure at $5.",
        "BRASILIA \u2014 It was called the \u201cBrazil model,\u201d or simply \u201cthe Lula model,\u201d back when this country\u2019s economy was roaring and its president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, was a superstar of the developing world. By balancing support for big business with big programs, the union boss turned statesman presided over an era of growth that lifted tens of millions of Brazilians out of poverty. Lula\u2019s presidency cut a new template for a Latin American left that had long insisted that class struggle and revolution were the only road to fairness.",
        "In the \u201dGrand Theft Auto\u201d series, one of the world\u2019s video game franchises, players can have sex with women and then kill them. The action boosts the health of the protagonists \u2014 all of which are men. Researchers wondered how encouraging this kind of brutality in the digital realm could impact teenagers.",
        "A small core of individuals is responsible for the record sums cascading into the coffers of super PACs for the 2016 elections, a dynamic that harks back to the financing of presidential campaigns in the Gilded Age. Close to half of the money \u2014 41 percent \u2014 raised by the groups by the end of February came from just 50 and their relatives, according to a Washington Post analysis of federal campaign finance reports. of those are Republican supporters who have invested millions trying to shape the GOP nomination contest.",
        "Court records released Friday show that federal prosecutors investigated whether Vincent C. Gray, as a candidate for mayor in 2010, promised city jobs and thousands of dollars to a political rival to get him out of the Democratic primary. Among hundreds of pages of documents unsealed, an excerpt of an email to Gray describes city government positions he allegedly offered to Leo Alexander if he dropped out of the primary, which Gray won on his way to becoming mayor.",
        "President Obama is demanding better, cheaper versions of the cable boxes that millions of Americans use to browse their channels, in hopes of enhancing competition. The Obama administration pressed for changes to the cable box in a letter to federal regulators Thursday night, according to multiple people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because the filing is not yet public. Obama\u2019s move effectively throws the full weight of his office behind the Federal Communications Commission, which has taken the lead role in trying to crack open the market for TV boxes.",
        "Several Northern Virginia high school debate teams said they will boycott the state championships at Liberty University, whose president, Jerry Falwell Jr. made a speech in December that many saw as threatening to Muslims. Debate coaches and students have been lobbying the Virginia High School League, the nonprofit group that oversees state interscholastic sports and academic competitions, to move the state championship to another location. Liberty University is a private, evangelical 180 miles south of Washington.",
        "MYTILENE, Greece \u2014 For the hundreds of thousands of desperate migrants who have made landfall on this verdant jewel in the Aegean Sea over the past year, there had only been two ways off the island: a ferry bound for a new life deeper in Europe or a deportation order that led straight back across the sea. But that was before Saturday, when Pope Francis whisked in and pioneered a third: a ride with him on a jet bound for Rome.",
        "Students applying to top colleges crave to hear \u201cyes!\u201d when decisions roll out in March and brace themselves for \u201cno. \u201d But huge numbers get a vague answer that is neither admission nor denial \u2014 a tantalizing \u201cmaybe\u201d \u2014 with an invitation to join a wait list. offers far outnumber seats in the entering classes at many of those schools, a Washington Post analysis found."
