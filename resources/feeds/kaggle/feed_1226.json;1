        "A mother has accused two Georgia elementary school administrators of giving her a shocking ultimatum: Allow your son to be paddled or face jail time. \u201cThey told me if he could not get a paddling he would have to be suspended and if he got suspended for even one day I WILL go to jail for truancy,\u201d Shana Marie Perez wrote in a Facebook posting that included video of son Thomas in a struggle with two administrators. \u201cI could not go to jail or my kids would have nothing \u2026 I can\u2019t take care of my kids in jail.",
        "The conservative justices on the Supreme Court gave little indication Monday that they were inclined to fully revive President Obama\u2019s stalled plan to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation and give them the right to work legally in this country. Instead, the court\u2019s conservatives and liberals seemed split while hearing a challenge to the plan, and a tie would leave in place a lower court\u2019s decision that the president exceeded his powers in issuing the directive.",
        "For someone who preaches the importance of diplomacy and outreach, even to longtime enemies, President Obama can be awfully tough on his friends. In recent months, he has offended most of the United States\u2019 Persian Gulf allies. \u201cAll I need in the Middle East is a few smart autocrats,\u201d he joked privately, according to a recent profile in the Atlantic magazine. Publicly, he has said he \u201cweeps\u201d for Saudi and Kuwaiti children. The United States\u2019 European allies, he complains, have grown too dependent on American firepower to keep them safe. Even the United Kingdom, a U. S.",
        "The world economy is nearing what international policymakers fear could be a dangerous turning point, as populist uprisings in the United States and Europe threaten to unravel alliances that have fostered free trade and deepened economic ties. The tension has reached boiling point in Britain, which in two months will vote on whether to leave the European Union. The International Monetary Fund, which wrapped up its annual meetings this weekend in Washington, warned that a Brexit is a \u201creal possibility,\u201d one that could usher in a new era of uncertainty and undermine the already fragile global recovery.",
        "After covering several incidents involving the killings of civilians by police officers in 2014, Washington Post staff writer Wesley Lowery was surprised to discover that there were no official statistics about such fatalities. So Lowery pitched an idea to his editors: The newspaper, he suggested, should collect the information itself and analyze it for patterns in law enforcement. The Post soon marshaled an extraordinary team of reporters, editors, researchers, photographers and graphic artists to do just that.",
        "In politics there are some issues where liberals and conservatives share the same goal, but disagree about how to achieve it \u2014 we all want to have as little crime as possible, for instance, but there are different ideas about how to accomplish that. Then there are issues where the two groups have different goals \u2014 liberals want to preserve women\u2019s reproductive rights, and conservatives don\u2019t. And sometimes, there are issues we think fall in the first category, but actually belong in the second.",
        "Visiting justices from Canada s high court sat in on Monday s immigration arguments before the Supreme Court \u201d and after their education in the current state of American jurisprudence, our neighbors to the north would be forgiven if they had fantasies of building a border wall of their own. The Senate s refusal to confirm a replacement for the late Justice Antonin Scalia has left the U. S. high court evenly split and increasingly paralyzed.",

        "According to CNN, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew will announce this week that Alexander Hamilton is staying on the front of the $10 bill, where he belongs. Instead, a woman will replace national regret Andrew Jackson on the $20. This is correct! Well done! And it only took a year of indignation, a blockbuster musical about the former treasury secretary that became a national phenomenon (who saw that coming?) and lots of impassioned thinkpieces to accomplish what the #Womenon20s movement knew was the right call from the start. This will take longer, but that is fine.",
        "A flood event of excessive proportions has crippled Houston and a vast region surrounding it. Five to 17 inches of rain have fallen in the area in less than 24 hours, inundating homes and roads, while forcing more than 1, 000 high water rescues.

        "The Indian government appeared to concede Monday that a spectacular diamond adorning a British royal crown made its way to London fair and square \u2014 as a gift. As part of a public interest filing seeking the gem\u2019s return, India\u2019s solicitor general, Ranjit Kumar, told the country\u2019s supreme court that the coveted jewel was not stolen or forcibly taken away, as many in India have long argued.

What a waste. \u201d The mayor to whom he was referring, by the way, is himself, Rodrigo \u201cDigong\u201d Duterte, mayor of Davao City on the southern island of Mindanao in the Philippines. That\u2019s the kind of dark, cruel joke most people would be embarrassed to tell (or even hear) in the privacy of their own homes, yet it\u2019s one that Duterte, a candidate for president of the Philippines, told publicly.",

        "Donald Trump is very angry that the Republicans rigged their delegate system against him. He is so angry that he can\u2019t stop talking about it. Here he is last week. \u201dYou know the system, folks, is rigged. It\u2019s a rigged system,\u201d Trump said during a rally in New York. \u201dNow you have to understand, I\u2019m not complaining about the states that I won.

        "NEW YORK \u2014 Voting continued Tuesday in the most raucous nominating contest of an already wild presidential campaign season, with New York a coveted prize for Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton, who anticipate wins tonight that will vault them closer to their party\u2019s nomination. Polls show Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump leading by margins in a state with vastly diverse backdrops, from the riches of Wall Street and suburban Westchester County to the struggles of industrial cities upstate like Watervliet and Watertown.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign has undergone a series of sudden and dramatic changes in recent days, marking a key inflection point \u2014 a moment that either rescues his White House bid or one that came too little and too late. Although Trump has won more than 20 state nominating contests \u2014 more than twice as many as his top rival, Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) \u2014 he is at risk of failing to gain the support of a majority of delegates before the Republican Party\u2019s convention in July.",
        "Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are favored to win New York\u2019s presidential primary Tuesday, but several key factors are likely to determine the size of each candidate\u2019s delegate haul in the state. The two major questions for Tuesday are: (1) How many congressional districts Trump will win with a majority (thereby sweeping all three delegates in each) and (2) whether Clinton can net a substantial vote margin, which matters because delegates are awarded proportionally. Here\u2019s a quick guide for what to watch for in the Democratic and Republican contests. Republican race: Is upstate New York also Trump Country?",
        "is different from business expertise, as Donald Trump has amply demonstrated. The former involves manipulating the media, creating a \u201cbrand\u201d and displaying an arrogant indifference to social norms. The latter requires discipline, judgment, and leadership. So long as Trump could get by as a in the presidential campaign, he was successful; when, however, it became an exercise in he flopped. We now are learning just how badly the Trump campaign has been run and how radical a is needed if he is to have a chance at winning the nomination.",

New York \u2014 the place, its people, its outsize role in American culture and, yes, its values \u2014 has long played badly in the Republican heartland. Cruz boasted about the effect of his sally the night he won Iowa. \u201cAs I travel the country here in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada, everyone knows what New York values are,\u201d he told ABC News\u2019s Jonathan Karl shortly after delivering his Iowa victory speech.",
        "Megyn Kelly is a star. The Fox News host runs a successful cable news show, has book publishers throwing millions of dollars her way, with Donald Trump in this season\u2019s most compelling political soap opera, and is even starting to consider what life might look like after Fox News. Kelly deserves whatever success comes her way. Few anchors in cable news history have been able to grab the number of viewers that The Kelly Files has garnered in two short years.",
        "Tevi Troy is a really smart guy who has written really smart things about the evolution of the Ideas Industry in Washington: See his excellent National Affairs essay on the evolution of the think tank. Troy\u2019s latest, for Politico, looks at the trial separation between the 2016 Republican presidential candidates and GOP policy intellectuals: It\u2019s easy to lay the blame at Donald Trump\u2019s feet (after all, it\u2019s hard to imagine another Republican candidate of the last four decades rejecting National Review so cavalierly) but this year\u2019s split between intellectuals and the GOP goes beyond the .",
        "There are a lot of wonderful things about France in the springtime: the flowers blooming in the Luxembourg Gardens, the Parisians ambling along the Promenade Plant\u00e9e, the green woods around the Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau in the Loire Valley and the fabulous produce that makes its way into Paris\u2019s restaurants.

        "A federal appeals court in Richmond has sided with a transgender high school student, saying that he can proceed with his lawsuit arguing that his school board\u2019s decision to ban him from the boys\u2019 bathroom is discriminatory.

        "NEW ORLEANS New immunotherapy drugs are showing significant and extended effectiveness against a broadening range of cancers, including rare and intractable tumors often caused by viruses. Researchers say these advances suggest the treatment approach is poised to become a critical part of the nation\u2019s strategy. Scientists reported Tuesday that the medications, which marshal the body\u2019s own immune defenses, are now proving effective against head and neck cancer and an extremely lethal skin cancer called Merkel cell carcinoma.",
        "This story has been updated. UnitedHealth Group, the nation\u2019s largest health insurer, said Tuesday that in 2017 it will exit most of the 34 states where it offers plans on the Affordable Care Act insurance exchanges. \u201dWe will be down to a handful of states that we will be actively participating in the exchanges,\u201d Stephen J.

        "When Texas Republicans assemble for their state convention next month, it\u2019s possible they will debate whether Texas should secede from the United States. There\u2019s almost no chance Texas Republicans will actually vote in favor of seceding, mind you not least because most of the party wants nothing to do with this but the fact we\u2019re even mentioning secession and the Texas GOP convention in the same sentence suggests that the movement has become a priority for at least some conservative Texans. To be sure, that seems to be a relatively small group.",
