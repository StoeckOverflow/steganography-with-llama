        "An Ohio teenager accused of   the rape of her    friend has pleaded not guilty to multiple charges stemming from the alleged incident in February. Marina Lonina, 18, a student at New Albany High School, outside Columbus, was attempting to record the assault as evidence, her attorney, \u00c2 Sam Shamansky, said during a court appearance Friday.",
        "Think about how your grandma met your grandpa: She probably didn\u2019t swipe right because of an amusing description in his Tindr profile. Dating has changed hugely over the past generations, and so have cultural ideas about what men and women value most in a mate. This idea is perfectly illustrated by a chart that economist Max Roser, who created the blog Our World in Data, recently put out on Twitter.",
        "Catholic Armenian women in customary dress. (between 1905 and 1915) Sergei Mikhailovich was born near Moscow in 1863. Educated as a chemist, applied his knowledge and skills towards the advancement of photography. He was especially interested in the reproduction of color, which at the time was a tedious and difficult process. Though some of his images date back to 1905, the bulk of his work documenting the Russian empire of Tsar Nicholas II took place between . \u2019s color photos were recorded as \u201cseparation negatives\u201d on black and white glass plates.",
        "The Supreme Court heard a challenge to President Obama\u2019s policies on immigration Monday morning, a politically sensitive case that could affect millions of people living in the United States illegally and their families. The Obama administration has sought to offer some undocumented immigrants a guarantee that they would be allowed to stay in the United States temporarily. The president\u2019s done so in two steps. In 2012, he allowed undocumented immigrants brought to the United States at a young age to apply for a temporary reprieve from deportation.",
        "STATE COLLEGE, Pa. \u2014 Hillary Clinton\u2019s victory in the New York primary Tuesday has brought Sen. Bernie Sanders one step closer to a series of difficult decisions that can be summed up in one simple question: What does Bernie want? How he answers that question will have a direct bearing on how united Democrats will be heading into the fall campaign \u2014 and whether Sanders will be able to leverage his success this year into lasting power and influence. His campaign for the Democratic nomination has been more successful than almost anyone had predicted.",
        "Hillary Clinton got what she needed in New York, a solid victory that stopped Bernie Sanders\u2019s winning streak. But any cause for celebration among her supporters probably will be tempered by the reality that her unexpectedly difficult nomination battle has taken a significant toll on her candidacy. By the end of next week\u2019s contests in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware, her lead in pledged delegates in all likelihood will be insurmountable.",

        "So now that it\u2019s confirmed that Harriet Tubman will grace the front of the $20 bill, the next question is: Which Tubman? The antebellum abolitionist who supported John Brown and criticized Lincoln for his incrementalist approach to abolishing slavery, or the figure of legend who was the subject of sentimental biographies? Designs for the new bill haven\u2019t been released, and it could be well into the next decade for the newly designed currency to begin circulating. But the Bureau of Engraving and Printing will have some interesting choices when it comes to representing Tubman.",
        "More than a quarter of a million active and retired truckers and their families could soon see their pension benefits severely cut \u2014 even though their pension fund is still years away from running out of money. Within the next few weeks, the Treasury Department is expected to announce a crucial decision on whether it will approve reductions to one of the country\u2019s largest pension plans.",
        "The Republican Party is a collection of reactionaries that faces electoral catastrophe in November. But don\u2019t take my word for it \u2014 take John Kasich\u2019s. \u201cFrankly, my Republican Party doesn\u2019t like ideas,\u201d Kasich said in an interview with The Post\u2019s editorial board Wednesday morning. \u201cThey want to be negative against things. \u201d There have been exceptions, he noted, such as Jack Kemp and Paul Ryan. But, he said, \u201cmost of \u2019em \u2014 the party is kind of a against. \u201d Kasich does not argue that the party has become too conservative. Kasich is himself quite .",
        "If authenticity is your calling card, how do you become authentically inauthentic? Welcome to the New Donald Trump, a marvel of the Complex and the age of minuscule attention spans. It took Richard Nixon prodigious feats of hard work between 1962 and 1968 to create the New Nixon who got himself into the White House. But in an era when \u201cbrand\u201d is both a noun and a verb and when \u201ccurating\u201d is the thing to do, why should it surprise us that the New Trump took less than two weeks to fabricate?",
        "Before the 2016 presidential primary season kicked off, I told Democratic friends that of all the people lining up from the Republican Party, Ohio Gov. John Kasich was the only one who could give Hillary Clinton a serious run for her money. Wednesday morning, Kasich perfectly demonstrated why. In a GOP primary contest defined by racism, xenophobia and a reliance on slogans masquerading as policy, Kasich debated the issues with my editorial board colleagues with knowledge and conviction.",
        "Five former New Orleans police officers pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges that stem from the shooting of six unarmed people \u2014 two of whom died \u2014 in the days after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. These officers were sentenced to terms of between three and 12 years in prison, far less than they faced after being convicted at an earlier trial that was scuttled after what a federal court later described as \u201cshocking breaches of prosecutorial ethics.",
        "The British Foreign Office has released an advisory warning travelers to be aware of controversial new laws in North Carolina and Mississippi before visiting the United States. The travel advisory update \u2014 directed to members of the country\u2019s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community \u2014 was posted on the Foreign Office\u2019s website Tuesday. \u201cThe U.

        "The Supreme Court on Wednesday cleared the way for American victims of terrorism to collect nearly $2 billion in seized Iranian assets, but not without a warning from Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. that the court was undermining its authority. The justices ruled 6 to 2 that Congress had not violated the separation of powers when it passed a bill making it easier for about 1, 300 people to collect money on behalf of those killed or injured in the 1983 bombing of a U. S. Marine Corps barracks in Beirut and other attacks blamed on Iran.",
        "Rep. Donna F. Edwards was beaming as she greeted supporters outside a Prince George\u2019s County firehouse on a recent Friday, ready to regale another debate audience with her history as a single mother and her quest to diversify the U. S. Senate. \u201cLet me give you a hug!\u201d Edwards gushed, wrapping her arms around a friend. A few feet away, Edwards saw another familiar face: Dave Chapman, a neighborhood activist from her district. But Chapman, 74, was holding up a sign for Rep. Chris Van Hollen, her opponent in the bruising race to succeed Sen. Barbara A.",

The conclusions are in from a series of scientific surveys of the Great Barrier Reef bleaching event \u2014 an environmental assault on the largest coral ecosystem on Earth \u2014 and scientists aren\u2019t holding back about how devastating they find them. Australia\u2019s National Coral Bleaching Task Force has surveyed 911 coral reefs by air, and found at least some bleaching on 93 percent of them. The amount of damage varies from severe to light, but the bleaching was the worst in the reef\u2019s remote northern sector \u2014 where virtually no reefs escaped it.",

With Kelly and Michael\u201d to join \u201cGood Morning America\u201d full time, Kelly Ripa was nowhere to be found. Instead, Strahan showed up with substitute host Ana Gasteyer, formerly of the network\u2019s \u201cSuburgatory\u201d and a guest star on \u201cThe Goldbergs. \u201d ABC confirmed Ripa will be gone through at least Monday.",
        "Wednesday marks the 17th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre \u2014 the terrible day in 1999 when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 13 and wounded dozens more before killing themselves in Colorado. In the strangely American phenomenon of mass shootings, Columbine comes up again and again. As I wrote last year: It was Columbine that changed everything \u2026 a horrifying event that occurred just as the Internet was taking root in the lives of ordinary Americans.",
        "HOLLYWOOD, Fla. \u2014 As the Republican presidential race heads toward a possible contested convention, the three remaining candidates have begun considering picks \u2014 with a much different set of calculations from a normal political year. Separate but simultaneous vetting processes are underway. Advisers to Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Gov. John Kasich said they are developing a list of prospects and researching their backgrounds. They are leaving open the possibility of announcing running mates as early as June, when primary voting concludes, or waiting until July at the Republican National Convention.",
        "More than 13 years after an Egyptian cleric was kidnapped off the streets of Milan by CIA operatives, one former agency officer now living in Portugal faces extradition to Italy, where she was sentenced to four years in prison for the abduction. Sabrina De Sousa, 60, was one of 26 Americans convicted in absentia by Italian courts for her alleged role in the February 2003 rendition of Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr, also known as Abu Omar.",
        "A musical chameleon and flamboyant showman who never stopped evolving, Prince was one of the music world\u2019s most enigmatic superstars. He celebrated unabashed hedonism, sang of broken hearts and spiritual longing and had a mysterious personal identity that defied easy definition. In such hit songs as \u201c1999,\u201d \u201cLittle Red Corvette,\u201d \u201cI Would Die 4 U,\u201d \u201cWhen Doves Cry\u201d and \u201cPurple Rain,\u201d Prince produced a musical legacy and a provocative stage presence that set him apart from most other entertainers of the 1980s and \u201990s.",
        "If you believe, as do I, that God created baseball as a relief from politics, I herewith offer, as a public service, a column not about Trump, Cruz, Sanders & Clinton but about Harper & friends. We all have our ways of marking the seasons. I know it\u2019s spring when in early April I start my morning by skipping The Post front page and going right to the sports section. It\u2019s not until I\u2019ve fully savored the baseball box scores that I resignedly turn to politics. My friends are forever puzzled by my devotion to the game.",
        "When the news came this afternoon that Prince had died at 57 at his home in Minnesota, a chorus went up that it was the latest cruelty of 2016, a year that already feels merciless in those it\u2019s claimed, four months along. But if the deaths of Prince, and Bowie, and Chyna, and Harper Lee taken together feel like a moment of catastrophic generational turnover, the loss of Prince and Bowie represent a more specific calamity.",
        "Conservatives should be delighted that Harriet Tubman\u2019s likeness will grace the $20 bill. She was a Republican, after all, and a pious Christian. And she routinely exercised her Second Amendment right to carry a gun, which she was ready to use against anyone who stood in her way \u2014 or any fugitive slave having second thoughts. On her long road to freedom, there was no turning back. Instead, we\u2019ve had mostly silence from the right.",
        "Pundits have puzzled over why John Kasich \u2014 popular Ohio governor, former congressman and presidential candidate untempted by and comparisons \u2014 has gained so little traction among the Republican base. I finally figured out why. It\u2019s because he\u2019s running as the Republican Obama. In a meeting with The Post\u2019s editorial board this week, Kasich answered many of our policy and political questions with some version of the following: In today\u2019s intolerably polarized climate, he will bring people together to work out their differences.",
        "Barack Obama has a full schedule in London this week. There is lunch with the Queen, on the occasion of her 90th birthday. There is dinner with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, otherwise known as Will and Kate. There are talks with the prime minister, David Cameron, about the appalling state of the world. And then, perhaps, with Cameron\u2019s approval, the president may pronounce a few sentences encouraging the British to stay in the European Union. In mere anticipation of these words, Obama has already been attacked by . U.",
        "THE USUAL concern of an editorial page is government ineptitude or corruption, but it is also our occasional pleasant duty to call attention to cases of government competence \u2014 the most recent of which is Treasury Secretary Jack Lew\u2019s proposed redesign of U. S. currency. In fact, \u201ccompetent\u201d is too weak an encomium for Mr. Lew\u2019s elegant handling of a sensitive task \u2014 to include images of women and minorities on heretofore paper money.

        "Search teams working in Shenandoah National Park on Thursday discovered a body believed to be that of a Fairfax County firefighter whose car was found in the park on Saturday. Virginia State Police preliminarily identified the body as that of Nicole K. Mittendorff, 31, of Woodbridge. Officials also said the search for her had been suspended. The discovery followed six days of intensive searching for Mittendorff in a heavily forested area. Officials said a note found in Mittendorff\u2019s car and other evidence leads them to believe Mittendorff did not die as a result of foul play.",
        "The Washington Wizards and Scott Brooks have agreed in principle on a deal worth $35 million for Brooks to become the team\u2019s head coach, according to people with knowledge of the situation. Wizards President Ernie Grunfeld and Vice President Tommy Sheppard traveled to Southern California on Wednesday to meet with Brooks, 50, who was always the clear favorite for the job, as news trickled out earlier that day that another potential target, former Chicago Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau, would become the Minnesota Timberwolves\u2019 coach and president of basketball operations."
