With Kelly and Michael\u201d Michael Strahan will jump to big leagues this fall to join \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d the morning show in the country. It was triumphant news: GMA, which has seen a slight decline in ratings, could get a boost. And Strahan, who has gone from former New York Giants defensive end to TV celebrity, could solidify his star status. Then the story changed.",

Thursday in a girls\u2019 bathroom at Wilmington\u2019s Howard High School of Technology, according to school officials.

        "The Huey has been a mainstay of U. S. wars since its debut in the jungles of Vietnam. Now, the Air Force is looking to retire the venerable aircraft, and lawmakers are fighting over how it will be replaced. The Air Force fields roughly 60 Hueys that are split between a number of missions. One contingent of the helicopters provides security to intercontinental ballistic missile sites, while another is meant to evacuate members of the government during a time of national emergency. The Air Force also uses a small number of Hueys for missions. [Sikorsky wins $1.",
        "It was clear from the first paragraph that this wasn\u2019t your typical consumer report. \u201cI write this from the hospital,\u201d John Stossel of Fox wrote. \u201cSeems I have lung cancer. \u201d This was quite the revelation \u2014 one all the more powerful for its delivery in terse, prose. But Stossel, who said he \u201cwill barely notice that a fifth of my lung is gone\u201d and that he will \u201cbe fine,\u201d wasn\u2019t here for a meditation on mortality a la Oliver Sacks.",

        "HOLLYWOOD, Fla. \u2014 Out on the campaign trail, Donald Trump relishes his feud with his own party. He threatened to sue the Republican National Committee. He called its nominating system \u201crigged,\u201d \u201cdeceptive\u201d and \u201ca disgrace. \u201d And he has suggested he might try to depose the party chairman. But as RNC members gathered at a palatial beach resort here this week, Trump\u2019s aides launched an urgent effort aimed at rebranding the mogul\u2019s persona and thawing hostilities with the skittish party elite.",
        "Eight family members were shot \u201c \u201d in four different homes in southern Ohio, some while they were still sleeping in their beds, authorities said, warning that their killer is probably still on the loose. When deputies arrived at the various crime scenes, they found two babies and one toddler left alive, officials said.

The two other child survivors were 6 months old and 3 years old.",
        "Wrapped in a black coat, Romechia Simms walks through a cemetery in Southern Maryland on a cold March day, tiptoeing around headstones, making her way to the grave of her son. She\u2019s still grieving for him, still trying to forgive herself for how Ji\u2019Aire Donnell Lee died \u2014 on a swing in a park where she\u2019d been pushing him for nearly two days. Although a judge in February found Simms not criminally responsible for her actions because she suffers from schizophrenia, she has to find a way to live with what happened. And what she\u2019s lost.",
        "MEXICO CITY \u2014 With a swipe of his pen this week, Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto proposed that Mexican citizens could legally possess up to an ounce of pot. The day before, Canada\u2019s health minister stood at a United Nations podium and announced that her country would introduce new federal legislation to make cannabis legal by next year. Already, people are free to smoke marijuana in four U. S. states and the District of Columbia, and medical marijuana is allowed in almost half the country. Uruguay has fully legalized weed for sale.",
        "DO YOU remember when Donald Trump crudely mocked the disability of a New York Times reporter, and then lied about having done so? No? That\u2019s just as the Republican candidate might hope. Now that he is nearing the Republican nomination, he says he will become more \u201cpresidential. \u201d After winning the New York primary, he referred to \u201cSenator Cruz\u201d instead of \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted. \u201d You can expect multitudes of and sycophants to follow Chris Christie\u2019s craven path to believing, or pretending to believe, in a presidential Trump.

Mike Konczal is a fellow with the Roosevelt Institute, where he works on inequality and financialization. That the largest financial institutions pose both an economic and political problem is clear, but the danger runs deeper than this.

        "Donald Trump picked an inopportune time to try to make people forget his history: concurrent with the Jewish festival of Passover, a holiday about recalling the past. With a haste suggesting he thinks Americans aren\u2019t all that bright, Trump has been rebranding himself as an inoffensive candidate for the general election. He gave a temperate victory speech in New York on Tuesday and he took more moderate positions this week on gay rights, abortion and the national debt.",
        "With the nomination in sight, the transformation of Donald Trump is underway. That brash, bigoted, bullying loudmouth mounting a string of rallies masquerading as a presidential campaign? He\u2019s on his way out. Experienced political professionals have taken over, and the New Donald is on his way, just a regular politician like all the others.",
        "Should the United States cut its ties to Saudi Arabia? The question emerges amid fresh controversies and President Obama\u2019s recent visit to the kingdom. I\u2019ve been a critic of Saudi Arabia for decades, but despite all the problems, I think the United States is better off with the alliance than without. Congress might soon pass a bill that would allow individual Americans \u2014 relatives of those who died on \u2014 to sue the Saudi government.",
        "SALZBURG, Austria \u2014 On a crisp morning last October, 198 migrants arrived on the Greek island of Leros, all of them seemingly desperate people seeking sanctuary in Europe. But hiding among them were four men with a very different agenda. The four were posing as Syrians \u2014 all carrying doctored passports with false identities. And they were on a deadly mission for the Islamic State. Two of the four would masquerade as migrants all the way to Paris. There, at 9:20 p. m. on Nov.",

        "The judge knew that Sgt. Joseph Serna had been through a lot. The former Special Forces soldier did four combat tours in Afghanistan over a nearly career with the U. S. Army. Through those years, the Fayetteville Observer reported, Serna was almost killed three times: once, by a roadside bomb, then again by a suicide bomber. During a tour in 2008, Serna and three other soldiers were driving down a narrow dirt road in Kandahar when their armored truck toppled into a canal, the Associated Press reported. As water filled the vehicle, Serna struggled to escape.",
        "President Obama said Friday that North Carolina and Mississippi\u2019s laws limiting protections for transgender, lesbian, gay and bisexual people are \u201dwrong\u201d and \u201dshould be overturned.\u201d Speaking at a news conference in London with British Prime Minister David Cameron, Obama praised Americans living in states that have recently taken steps to single out individuals based on their gender identity or sexual orientation, even as he criticized their approach to the issue.",
        "Fatima Shahbaz and Jessica Boyer, juniors at McLean High School in Fairfax County, Va. are a pair of debaters who as a team have gone undefeated this season in the Virginia High School League. But as the state\u2019s top students gather at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va. for the state debate championship Friday, the teenagers and several other debaters will be sitting it out. Debaters from at least five Northern Virginia high schools decided to boycott the state tournament because of remarks made by Liberty University president Jerry Falwell Jr. that they perceived to be .",
        "If there\u2019s one person qualified to tout the benefits of dining in the nude, it\u2019s Seb Lyall. The London restaurateur, known for opening some of the city\u2019s most innovative dining concepts, eats his breakfast each morning \u2014 assuming he\u2019s not cooking with hot oil. \u201cIt\u2019s liberating,\u201d he told The Washington Post. \u201cIt\u2019s fun and sometimes the neighbors watch \u2014 fine, whatever. \u201cIt\u2019s my home and my space, and that\u2019s kind of the space we\u2019re trying to create in the restaurant \u2014 our own little space. It will be fascinating what the response is.",
        "Yes, I know. The Democratic primary race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders is still going on. But, the delegate math is very, very close to determinative \u2014 in her favor. While the race will go on \u2014 maybe even until June 7 when California closes out the process \u2014 it\u2019s worth taking a first cut at the men and women that Clinton will consider to be her vice presidential nominee.",
        "JENKINTOWN, Pa. \u2014 A general election contest against Donald J. Trump could play out like \u201dvile\u201d Internet bullying, Hillary Clinton said Friday. \u201cI am hoping that if I am fortunate enough to be president and break that highest and hardest glass ceiling, it will send a message: Stand up to this,\u201d the Democratic told a small group of women invited to discuss equal pay and workplace fairness. People make \u201dthe most vile, hateful\u201d insults online, things they would never say to someone\u2019s face, Clinton said.",
        "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Republican groups, leaders and candidates opposed to Donald Trump increasingly see the Indiana primary as a central front in their efforts to stop him from clinching the GOP presidential nomination. But fractures in the movement, and a clear lack of urgency among local Republicans to unite against Trump, are undercutting their ability to deliver the state. With Trump poised to rack up more delegates in five Eastern states on Tuesday, Indiana\u2019s May 3 primary is shaping up as a for Sen.",

And if you live in Hirean\u2019s neighborhood in Romania, your laundry may even be pictured on Instagram.

        "At the start of the presidential campaign, Ted Cruz told voters he would be the only \u201cconsistent conservative\u201d in a crowded Republican field. Then he confronted the modern GOP \u2014 a fractured party, in which each faction has a different definition of what \u201cconservative\u201d means. To consistently please all of them, Cruz has had to be inconsistent with himself. Time and again he has shifted, shaded or obfuscated his policy positions \u2014 piling on new ideas, which sometimes didn\u2019t fit with the old.",
        "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Saturday sought to quell scrutiny over leaked comments made by his chief strategist about the real estate mogul \u201cplaying\u201d a \u201cpart\u201d on the campaign trail. \u201cWhat he said, \u2018No, Mr. Trump can be this way, that way, he can be anything he wants.\u2019 \u201d Trump attempted to explain Saturday in Bridgeport, Conn. referring to comments his chief adviser, Paul Manafort, made to Republican National Committee members in a private meeting. \u201cWhat I say here, it\u2019s always got to be said in a different way.",
        "Hatshepsut was no ordinary Egyptian ruler. After her husband died, Hatshepsut didn\u2019t just keep the \u201dthrone\u201d warm for her stepson to come of age. She became a pharaoh in her own right, and in doing so, became one of ancient Egypt\u2019s first female rulers. While there were likely two or three female pharaohs during the \u201ddynastic\u201d period, Hatshepsut is considered to be the most successful; she ruled for at least 15 years and was a prolific builder.",
        "Here are two words to strike fear in an intrepid film critic: Rose Byrne. Well, not any intrepid film critic. This intrepid film critic. Because I\u2019ve never gotten Rose Byrne. While her career has steadily ascended, with the pretty Australian actress snagging bigger and bigger roles, I\u2019ve remained as curiously unmoved as I was when I first saw her \u2014 in the uneven, strenuously \u201cI Capture the Castle. \u201d Since then, Byrne has become a actress when a role demands a game, deadpan sense of mischief.",
