        "It happened during the boarding process on a flight from Fort Lauderdale to JFK in the fall of 2009. I had long earlier learned that the key to a pleasant flight was to greet everyone as they walked onto the plane, so I stood in the front galley and said my hellos. Suddenly, a white woman leaned uncomfortably close to me and whispered, \u201cThere is a man, four people behind me, in a green shirt, who is very suspicious. \u201d I whispered back: \u201cOkay. What\u2019s he doing?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d she said, .",
        "In February 2009, large law firms were in crisis. The stock market was in free fall, Lehman Brothers had recently collapsed and rumors of lawyer layoffs and firm implosions were rampant. At Above the Law, the legal news website I founded in 2006, my colleague Elie Mystal and I were covering the developments closely. In the reader comments, we noticed persistent predictions bubbling up of layoffs at leading law firm Latham & Watkins. These comments led us to investigate further.",
        "Forty years ago, Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford came to a final showdown at the Republican National Convention in Kansas City, Mo. It was the first time since 1948 that no one knew heading into the convention who the nominee would be. And it was the last until, most likely, this summer\u2019s GOP convention in Cleveland. Unless Donald Trump wins 392 more delegates in the remaining primaries, Republicans supporting Trump, Ted Cruz and John Kasich will come to a bitter brawl over the nomination and attempts to sway uncommitted and wavering delegates.",
        "Kate Clifford Larson is the author of \u201cBound for the Promised Land: Harriet Tubman, Portrait of an American Hero. \u201d We think we know Harriet Tubman: former slave, Underground Railroad conductor and abolitionist. But much of Tubman\u2019s real life story has been shrouded by generations of myths and fake lore, propagated through children\u2019s books, that has only obscured her great achievements. The truth about the woman who will become the new face of the $20 bill is far more compelling and remarkable. 1. Tubman was the Moses of her people.",
        "Oklahoma is just a signature away from revoking the licenses of most doctors who perform abortions. Under a bill passed by the legislature this week, doctors who perform abortions \u2014 defined in the measure as \u201cunprofessional conduct\u201d \u2014 would be barred from obtaining or renewing their medical licenses. The bill, now on the governor\u2019s desk, would not apply to abortions performed to save a mother\u2019s life, although the bill lacks similar exceptions for abortions performed in cases of rape or incest. \u201cThis is our proper function, to protect life,\u201d the bill\u2019s sponsor, Sen.

        "KALLSTADT, Germany \u2014 Petra Berghold had no idea there was anything unusual about the modest winemaker\u2019s house she and her husband bought in 1994 and set about renovating. They turned the wine cellar into their living room. The pigsty is now a party room. But these days, the Bergholds keep their blue metal gate closed against the prying lenses of German tabloids, which showed up with a cutout of the U. S. Republican presidential and photographed it on the street outside. The Bergholds own the Trump Haus, where Donald Trump\u2019s grandfather, Friedrich, lived before leaving for America in 1885.",

        "WILMINGTON, Del. \u2014 White House hopeful Bernie Sanders said Saturday that many of his losses to Hillary Clinton in Democratic primaries were because \u201cpoor people don\u2019t vote. \u201d The senator from Vermont, who has made fighting income inequality the rallying cry of his campaign, was asked during a taping of NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d why Clinton had prevailed in 16 of 17 states so far with the highest levels of income inequalilty. \u201cWell, because poor people don\u2019t vote,\u201d Sanders told host Chuck Todd. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s just a fact.

        "LONDON \u2014 President Obama, speaking to young activists and leaders at a town hall meeting here Saturday, offered some unsolicited guidance to those pressing for change back home and had some tough words for the Black Lives Matter movement. The president was asked about the social movements that made him change his mind about issues in the White House. He credited the campaign for marriage equality for gay Americans for leading him to reverse his position, and then he pivoted to the Black Lives Matter movement.",
        "Prince\u2019s skills were no secret. Whether at the Super Bowl, stealing a Rock Hall jam or on his records, he could play it all. But to hear ZZ Top\u2019s legendary frontman Billy Gibbons tell it, Prince wasn\u2019t just a great guitar player. He was downright otherworldly. Gibbons spoke to The Post Friday about the guitar player who could stump even him. So much has been said about Prince but I do think it\u2019s important to remember that his guitar playing was, I don\u2019t know, just sensational. Tell me how you\u2019d describe it.",

Those skates eventually moved toward Nicklas Backstrom, and Ovechkin simultaneously embraced him with John Carlson.

        "Republicans belong to a more ideological party, but ideology has mattered less in the GOP primaries this year than in the race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.

        "The gender pay gap is back in the news \u2014 and it may become a major issue in the presidential campaign. It seems an case of job discrimination. Women earn only 79 percent of men\u2019s average hourly wages. Who could favor that? Actually, the comparison is bogus. A more accurate ratio, after adjusting for differences in gender employment patterns, is closer to 92 percent. Even the remaining gap of 8 percentage points may not stem fully from discrimination.",

        "NO ARGUMENT against the proposed Partnership trade agreement packs more emotional punch than the claim that the deal would be bad for people\u2019s health \u2014 and even result in avoidable deaths \u2014 both in the United States and in the 11 other signatory nations. The argument, repeated most recently in a letter to Congress from the U. S. branches of Doctors Without Borders, Oxfam America and about 50 other organizations is that the TPP would unduly extend U.
