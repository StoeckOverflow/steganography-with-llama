        "If you find yourself in an emergency situation in Green Mountain Falls, Colo. don\u2019t bother calling police. In this scenic western hamlet, they no longer exist. All four members of the town\u2019s police force \u2014 Tim Bradley, the police chief, and three volunteer reserve officers \u2014 resigned April 14 because of an alleged policy dispute with the municipality\u2019s newly elected mayor, according to Fox affiliate . Residents told the station that they weren\u2019t exactly sure why the resignations occurred. \u201cOur marshal and three deputies quit, and that\u2019s about all they said,\u201d Ann Pinnell said.",
        "Donald Trump supporters and the mainstream media have a routine that goes like this: The media report that the Republican presidential said or did something and then supporters reject the reports as . Which leads to the confounding question for journalists: Why does critical coverage of Trump have no effect on his loyalists? Wait. Scratch that. There is an effect \u2014 it arguably makes them more loyal, not less. But if that\u2019s the case, then why does critical coverage have a reverse effect? The obvious answer is that Trump\u2019s backers don\u2019t trust the media.",
        "BALTIMORE \u2014 Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders used a campaign stop Saturday in this economically challenged city to decry the difference between the life expectancies of the nation\u2019s rich and poor, declaring that \u201cpoverty is a death sentence. \u201d \u201cIf you are born in Baltimore\u2019s poorest neighborhood, your life expectancy is almost 20 years shorter than if you\u2019re born in its wealthiest neighborhood,\u201d the senator from Vermont said, adding that \u201c15 neighborhoods in Baltimore have lower life expectancies than North Korea. Two of them have a higher infant mortality rate than Palestine\u2019s West Bank.",
        "Barack Obama rose to prominence as a different kind of Democrat, an outsider who was not part of the establishment and who would chart a separate course. Eight years later, the president finds himself working hard to restore a party from which he was once eager to stand apart. Obama has presided over a greater loss of electoral power for his party than any president since World War II. And 2016 represents one last opportunity for him to reverse that trend.",
        "BORDEN, Ind. \u2014 A sudden political alliance between Ted Cruz and John Kasich against Republican presidential Donald Trump quickly ran into speed bumps Monday that exposed the plan\u2019s risks and called into question whether it would work. In their unconventional scheme, Kasich said he would clear the way for Cruz to face Trump in Indiana while Cruz would return the favor in Oregon and New Mexico. The plan aimed to produce what Republicans have yearned for since the fall: a showdown with the mogul.",
        "Along with the state officials and law professors who are happy that the Supreme Court this week is reviewing the corruption conviction of former Virginia governor Robert F. McDonnell, add inmate No. at the federal prison in Oakdale, La. He is otherwise known as Don E. Siegelman, the former governor of Alabama, whom many of those same people supported when the justices decided \u2014 twice \u2014 that his conviction did not warrant an extended review. \u201cI\u2019m not the slightest bit bitter about that at all,\u201d Siegelman said last week in a telephone interview from prison.",
        "UPDATE: On Monday afternoon, Muskogee County District Attorney Orvil Loge dropped both the civil and criminal charges against Eh Wah. In an interview with The Washington Post, Loge said \u201dI looked at the case and met with the officers, and determined that we would not be able to meet the burden of proof in the criminal case and in the civil case.\u201d Loge said a check for the full amount of money taken from Eh Wah will be mailed to Eh Wah\u2019s lawyers as soon as possible.

        "Metro\u2019s subway \u2014 once considered a transportation jewel \u2014 is mired in disrepair because the transit agency neglected to heed warnings that its aging equipment and poor safety culture would someday lead to chronic breakdowns and calamities. For nearly half a century, almost since construction of the subway system began, federal experts, civic and business groups, private transit organizations, and some Metro general managers and directors have raised red flags.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: Bernie Sanders continues to vow to fight on until the end. The question is what, exactly, he really means by this. All the latest polls suggest that Hillary Clinton is heading for sizable wins in Pennsylvania and Maryland tomorrow, which probably means that scrutiny of Sanders\u2019s true intentions for the endgame of the nomination process will only intensify. But it\u2019s now becoming obvious that Sanders is, if anything, ratcheting down expectations for this endgame.",
        "When democracy arrived in the eastern half of Europe a quarter century ago, imported from the West, it did not come in its purest, most Athenian form. Of course the West loaned the East quite a few constitutional lawyers, as well as lots of idealists who could talk about judicial reform or give advice on how to organize an election. But on the heels of the idealists arrived another crowd of \u201cexperts\u201d: the spin doctors, the masters of negative campaigning and the public relations firms who had honed their craft in U. S.",
        "Historian David Maraniss notes, in Sunday\u2019s Post, that President Obama came to office with the goal of changing \u201cthe trajectory of America\u201d and leaving \u201ca legacy as a president of consequence, the liberal counter to [Ronald] Reagan. \u201d On the front, he is the for certain. Reagan defeated Soviet communism and left us a safer world; Obama presided over the rise and metastasis of the Islamic State and left us a far more dangerous one.",
        "Last week on this page, I wrote: \u201cIf facts could kill the myth, it would be dead already. \u201d This week, I\u2019d like to explore how, despite the lack of empirical evidence, this myth not only lives but flourishes. My last post was based on testimony before the Joint Economic Committee, part of which drilled down on this false notion that tax cuts generate anywhere near enough growth to offset the revenue they lose.",

        "As Deflategate wore on, the lawyers representing Tom Brady forgot to do something essential. They forgot to argue their client\u2019s innocence. Instead Jeffrey Kessler and the NFL Players Association got so lost in pushing their interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement and trying to trim the powers of Commissioner Roger Goodell that they failed to drive home the essential point: How can a player be suspended for \u201cconduct detrimental\u201d when there was no conduct to begin with?",
        "The way the Justice Department tells it, conditions at the jail in Orleans Parish, La. are so bad that inmates are hurting themselves in hopes of getting transferred.

It was Pride weekend in Los Angeles, and traffic was piling up along the route to her destination in the Hollywood Hills. She chatted with the driver, Jesus, who was cordial \u2014 maybe a little too nice (he kept inviting her to dinner). Ten minutes in, she began to hear an \u201cincessant beeping,\u201d Younes said.

        "Humans appear to have a strong and innate sense of fairness. When somebody cheats other people, breaks the rules or otherwise behaves badly, we instinctively tend to try to avoid dealing with them, psychological research suggests. This tendency is probably an evolutionary adaptation that has allowed cooperative humans to thrive, and it may be a big factor in our incredible success as a species. What\u2019s fascinating is that this aversion to dealing with people who are unfair, bad or immoral appears present in very young children, too \u2014 even babies.",

        "Donald Trump won in all five Republican presidential primaries held on Tuesday \u2014 a clean sweep that illustrated his dominance along the Eastern Seaboard and prompted the real estate mogul to declare himself the \u201cpresumptive nominee. \u201d In the Democratic race, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton won four of the five states in play on Tuesday: Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania.

        "Paul Manafort was hired by Donald Trump to bring the wisdom of an old Washington hand to a campaign of political novices and provide expertise on the arcane art of counting convention delegates. But beneath the image of a campaign wise man is a more complex picture of a veteran consultant who has pursued parallel careers as a lobbyist, political adviser and global dealmaker. He has parlayed political relationships around the world into an array of intricate financial transactions with billionaire oligarchs and other controversial investors that have at times spurred legal disputes.",

        "Donald Trump claims the Republican presidential primary system is \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201crigged\u201d against him. If anything, the opposite is true: The party\u2019s rules have largely operated in Trump\u2019s favor. Witness the fact that, going into Tuesday\u2019s primaries, Trump had won just 38 percent of the popular vote but 47 percent of the delegates awarded so far. Still, Trump\u2019s griping seems to have resonated even beyond his own supporters. The dispute highlights the friction between the parties\u2019 institutional interests in and voters\u2019 convictions that they run the show.",
        "CHARLOTTESVILLE When it comes to rhetoric, Plato was right and Aristotle \u2014 not so much. Distilled, Aristotle thought rhetoric good for democracy, though his definition of \u201cby the people\u201d was closer to our Founding Fathers\u2019 intent of only certain people than to today\u2019s model. Given this assumption of a narrow, educated, populace, Aristotle likely envisioned that those practicing rhetoric would be guided by accepted rules of argument and engagement, emphasizing ethos (trust and credibility) pathos (appropriate use of emotion) and logos (logical argument and facts).",

        "A year ago this week, when Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) announced that he was running for president, his campaign was widely dismissed as nothing more than a protest candidacy. Over the past 12 months, Sanders has defied the expectations of many in the political and media establishment. He has proven that there is a vast constituency of voters who are hungry for the progressive ideas at the heart of his campaign. And he has pushed Democratic Hillary Clinton to take bolder positions."
