        "AFTER A summit with Persian Gulf rulers last week, President Obama said his aim was to \u201cmake sure that . . . we share a broad common vision. \u201d Presumably that endeavor, and the defense of the Gulf states by the U. S. military, is not consistent with the abduction, torture and trial on charges of U. S. citizens. So we\u2019re hoping the president took the time to discuss the case of Kamal and Mohamed Eldarat when he met with Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, on the summit\u2019s sidelines.",
        "Apple reported its first quarterly revenue drop since 2003 on Tuesday in what investors worry is the end of a remarkable period of growth that had catapulted the computer maker into the most valuable company in the world. Shares were down sharply on Wednesday morning, as the Cupertino company said sales of its flagship iPhones dropped for the first time since their debut in 2007. That, more than any other statistic, drove the stock down 7 percent, wiping more than $40 billion from the companies market value. Apple\u2019s stock is one of the most widely held in America.",
        "Civil rights groups appealed a federal judge\u2019s ruling in North Carolina upholding what they call a \u201cmonster voter suppression law,\u201d while election experts said Tuesday that the closely watched case will have legal ramifications for voting across the country this presidential election year. North Carolina, a battleground state, is considered an epicenter for the nationwide battle over voting rights because its controversial 2013 election law is one of the strictest in the nation. \u201cIf North Carolina can get away with this kind of rollback, I suspect we will see other rollbacks in other states,\u201d said Richard L.",
        "Harris Wofford, a former Democratic senator from Pennsylvania, John F. Kennedy\u2019s presidential assistant on civil rights and an intimate of Martin Luther King Jr. will wed at his Foggy Bottom apartment Saturday before a gathering of family and friends. Dinner is to follow at a neighborhood Italian restaurant. The groom is 90. The other groom, Matthew Charlton, is 40.

        "The trolls hide behind screens.

        "On Monday, I wrote about a strange civil forfeiture case out of Oklahoma, in which Muskogee County sheriff\u2019s deputies seized over $53, 000 in cash from a Burmese Christian rock band, a church in Omaha and an orphanage in Thailand following a traffic stop over a busted tail light. After the story was published, Muskogee County District Attorney Orvil Loge decided to dismiss both the civil case (the cash seizure) and a criminal charge of \u201dacquir[ing] proceeds from drug activity\u201d against the principal defendant, Eh Wah, after reviewing the evidence and speaking with the officers involved.",

        "Supreme Court justices on Wednesday seemed prepared to overturn the 2014 corruption conviction of former Virginia governor Robert F. McDonnell and perhaps make it harder for prosecutors to bring charges against politicians who provide favors for their benefactors. Justices on both sides of the ideological divide expressed concern about federal corruption laws",
        "CHICAGO \u2014 A federal judge on Wednesday sentenced former House speaker J. Dennis Hastert to one year and three months in federal prison \u2014 a term above what prosecutors had recommended and one that clearly took into account the sexual abuse allegations that generated the criminal case against the Illinois Republican. Prosecutors called the sentence a \u201cday of reckoning\u201d for a man who was once a revered high school teacher and wrestling coach in Illinois and who ascended to the highest ranks of American politics.",
        "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Ted Cruz, in an apparent act of desperation, announced Wednesday that Carly Fiorina will be his vice presidential running mate if he is the Republican nominee for president. Announcing a running mate is an unusual step that comes as he trails GOP Donald Trump by a wide margin and faces an increasingly narrow path to the Republican nomination. Cruz hopes to gain steam in what amounts to a for him in Tuesday\u2019s Indiana primary.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 While celebrating sweeping victories in five primaries Tuesday night, Donald Trump mocked the qualifications of Democratic Hillary Clinton and suggested she was playing \u201dthe women\u2019s card\u201d to her advantage in the presidential race. \u201cFrankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don\u2019t think she\u2019d get 5 percent of the vote. The only thing she\u2019s got going is the women\u2019s card,\u201d Trump said during a news conference at Trump Tower. \u201cAnd the beautiful thing is, women don\u2019t like her.\u201d New Jersey Gov.",
        "Mr. Trump came to Washington to meet the establishment he has demonized the past 10 months. It was not love at first sight. His campaign left nothing to chance for his coming out as a candidate Wednesday, the day after primary wins in five states made him the all but inevitable Republican presidential nominee.

        "Donald Trump has decided that sexism in the quest for victory is no vice. Trump\u2019s supporters have regularly asked why his long string of primary successes has not led his Republican opponents to accept him as \u201cthe presumptive nominee,\u201d the phrase he used about himself Tuesday night. The candidate helpfully answered the question by showing that there is nothing normal about his campaign for the presidency. E. J.

        "As you have probably heard by now, the stakes in November\u2019s presidential election could not be higher. Control of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance. Ditto the fate of millions of undocumented immigrants. U. S. foreign policy could be in for its biggest since the Cold War. Yet in one crucial respect the election might make no difference at all.

        "WITH SWEEPING wins in five East Coast states Tuesday, Donald Trump socked the forces within the Republican Party that have vowed never to support him. Picking up more than 100 pledged delegates, he brought himself closer to clinching the GOP nomination on the first ballot at July\u2019s Republican National Convention, before most of the gains Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) has made in the party\u2019s arcane delegate selection process could come into play. These facts in hand, Mr. Trump declared himself the presumptive GOP nominee. If Mr.",

        "In this season of great earnings expectations, all the big tech names so far have disappointed save one. Facebook on Wednesday bucked a string of dismal tech earnings, beating Wall Street forecasts on almost every critical metric. The world\u2019s largest social network said it grew to 1. 65 billion monthly users and made $5. 38 billion over the first three months of this year, more than the $5. 25 billion many analysts were expecting. Profit was 77 cents a share, which blew away the 63 cents most analysts polled by Bloomberg had been expecting.",

        "In recent weeks, fights have raged in North Carolina and beyond over \u201cbathroom bills\u201d mandating that people use restrooms matching the gender on their birth certificates. One small city in Alabama just jumped into the fray and, in what may be a first, added what may be a new feature to its bathroom measure: jail time. The city council in Oxford, Ala. voted Tuesday to adopt an ordinance that would make it a crime for transgender people to use a public bathroom or changing facility different from the one on their birth certificate.",

        "Presidential humor is only a from dad humor, which in the world of comedy is considered light treason. But we\u2019ve tried to find at least one zinger from every U. S. president, to mark President Obama\u2019s final set of comedy at his eighth White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner on Saturday. Some zingers have less zing than others. Some are flat, some are apocryphal, some are just threats and some, in the case of Warren Harding, are quaint, loving references to the chief executive genitalia. But they are presidential, by definition, and therefore funny, by acclamation.",
        "Throughout the Republican Party, from New Hampshire to Florida to California, many leaders, operatives, donors and activists arrived this week at the conclusion they had been hoping to thwart or at least delay: Donald Trump will be their presidential nominee. An aura of inevitability is now forming around the controversial mogul. Trump smothered his opponents in six straight primaries in the Northeast and vacuumed up more delegates than even the most generous predictions foresaw. He is gaining endorsements by the day \u2014 a legendary Indiana basketball coach Wednesday, two House committee chairmen Thursday. And his rivals, Sen.",
        "FORT WAYNE, Ind. \u2014 In the space of just seven minutes here Thursday, Ted Cruz reminded fellow Republicans that he has few friends in the party. First he tangled with former House speaker John A. Boehner, a longtime foe who so dislikes Cruz that he labeled him \u201cLucifer in the flesh. \u201d Then Cruz undercut another Republican, fellow presidential candidate John Kasich, who had entered into an alliance with him to stop GOP Donald Trump. \u201cThere is no alliance,\u201d Cruz told reporters on Thursday, acting as if a pact announced by his own campaign days before had never happened."
