        "The fundraising juggernaut that has kept Bernie Sanders\u2019s insurgent White House bid afloat far longer than anticipated has generated another unexpected impact: a financial windfall for his team of Washington consultants. By the end of March, the democratic socialist senator from Vermont had spent nearly $166 million on his campaign \u2014 more than any other 2016 presidential contender, including rival Hillary Clinton.",
        "The military has filed new criminal charges against Marine Maj. Mark Thompson, a former U. S. Naval Academy instructor who insisted that he had been unfairly convicted of sexual misconduct with two female midshipmen. After revelations about his case in The Washington Post, the military has now charged Thompson with making a false official statement and conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman. If convicted of lying under oath, Thompson could face up to five years in prison, a dismissal from the service and a total loss of his retirement benefits. Retired U. S.",

        "Pay disparities between men and women start earlier in their careers than frequently assumed and have significantly widened for young workers in the past year, according to a report from the Economic Policy Institute. Paychecks for young female college graduates are about 79 percent as large as those of their male peers, the think tank found \u2014 a serious drop from 84 percent last year. The sudden change follows a more gradual shift. In 2000, women ages 21 to 24 with college degrees earned 92 percent of their male counterparts\u2019 wages on average, which was unchanged from 1990.",
        "WHAT WAS supposed to be a rare speech by Donald Trump on foreign policy Wednesday resembled a pastiche of his postulations from the campaign trail, cobbled together under the slogan \u201cAmerica First. \u201d Like the previous rhetoric, his proposals were loose, frequently contradictory and embedded in a bucket of falsehoods. Of these, the biggest was Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that he could somehow reverse the historical tides that have created a globalized economy and remedy the complex security challenges of the 21st century with a simple \u201cplan for victory with a capital V. \u201d It\u2019s not clear whether Mr.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: The signs are everywhere this morning: The Clinton and Sanders camps are now signaling how the Democratic primaries might wind down without too much noise, contentiousness, disruption, and anger. Could things still get very ugly? Yes. But at this point, that\u2019s looking less likely than the alternative. In an interview with me, Rep. Keith Ellison, a top supporter of Bernie Sanders who is also the of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, suggested the Clinton camp had some work to do in order to appeal to Sanders\u2019s supporters.",
        "The witty Tim Miller, communications director for the Our Principles PAC, tweets, \u201cIf your 2020 litmus test is: Did you stand up [for] conservative values in face of an orange demagogic GOP takeover, the field is rather small. \u201d That is an interesting dividing line. Who would that leave? And who would make the grade?

        "If you weren\u2019t already convinced that parody is now the central art form of our era, then Donald Trump\u2019s grand foreign policy speech yesterday was the proof. All of the elements of spoof \u201cforeign policy seriousness\u201d were in place. The introduction from a serious foreign policy figure, Zalmay Khalilzad. The sponsorship by a serious foreign policy magazine, the National Interest. The speech itself was a pastiche of a serious foreign policy speech.",
