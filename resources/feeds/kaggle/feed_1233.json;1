        "We don\u2019t often question the typical world map that hangs on the walls of classrooms \u2014 a patchwork of yellow, pink and green that separates the world into more than 200 nations. But Parag Khanna, a global strategist, says that this map is, essentially, obsolete. Khanna is the author of the new book \u201cConnectography: Mapping the Future of Global Civilization,\u201d in which he argues that the arc of global history is undeniably bending toward integration.",
        "\u201cKeep it 100,\u201d says Larry Wilmore, the comedian and talk show host, repeating the catchphrase that has become his trademark and guiding principle. Be honest, he means, keep it real and true \u2014 no matter what anyone else thinks. So on Saturday night, when Wilmore is the featured act at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner, seated on a dais with President Obama and Washington\u2019s media elite, how is he going to approach this? \u201cYou\u2019re court jester for the king,\u201d Wilmore says. But the king should expect to be skewered.",
        "The Large Hadron Collider near Geneva \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest, most powerful particle accelerator \u2014 is going to be out of commission for a few days. Scientists are blaming a weasel. No, they\u2019re not using slang to accuse their fellow researchers of subterfuge. It was an actual weasel. The #LHC will be down for at least a week because a weasel chewed into a 66kV transformer near LHCb, causing an power cut.",
        "The news came via Twitter Friday morning: Indiana Gov. Mike Pence was getting off the sidelines and endorsing Ted Cruz in advance of the Hoosier State\u2019s presidential primary on Tuesday! Yeaaahhhhh, sort of. Pence\u2019s actual \u201dendorsement\u201d was more like the world\u2019s most obvious attempt to have it both ways. Before he said anything about Cruz, Pence went out of his way to \u201dparticularly commend Donald Trump\u201d for, among other things, \u201dgiving voice to the frustration of millions of working Americans with the lack of progress in Washington, D.",

        "President Obama s plan for fighting the Islamic State is predicated on having a credible and effective Iraqi ally on the ground in Prime Minister Haider . And in recent days, the administration had been optimistic, despite the growing political unrest in Baghdad, about that critical partnership. But that optimism \u201d along with the administration s strategy for battling the Islamic State in Iraq \u201d was thrown into severe doubt after protesters stormed Iraq s parliament on Saturday and a state of emergency was declared in Baghdad.",
        "BAGHDAD \u2014 A state of emergency was declared in the Iraqi capital on Saturday as protesters stormed Iraq\u2019s parliament, after bursting into Baghdad\u2019s fortified Green Zone, where other key buildings including the U. S. Embassy are located, in a dramatic escalation of the country\u2019s political crisis. Live footage on Iraqi television showed swarms of protesters, who have been demanding government reform, inside the parliament building, waving flags, chanting and breaking chairs. Some lawmakers were berated and beaten with flags as they fled the building while other demonstrators smashed the car windows.",
        "As Donald Trump hunted for a deal that would help him keep part of the bankrupt Atlantic City casino empire he\u2019d built, fellow billionaire Carl Icahn mounted an aggressive counterattack. Icahn pushed in 2010 to wrest control of Trump Entertainment Resorts, backing lawyers who argued that one of Trump\u2019s most prized assets \u2014 his brand \u2014 was a \u201cdisadvantage\u201d that may no longer have been \u201csynonymous with business acumen, high quality . . . and enormous success. \u201d These days, the tension has given way to apparent harmony.",
        "For a long time, presidential humor was predictable as a joke. Then along came President Obama, dropping the word \u201cheezy,\u201d mimicking viral memes, and quipping that he and Joe Biden are so close, they\u2019d probably be denied service at an Indiana pizza joint. Obama, who will take the stage at the annual White House Correspondents\u2019 Association Dinner on Saturday to deliver the traditional monologue \u2014 the eighth and final of his administration \u2014 has a comic sensibility that\u2019s edgier and more than we\u2019re used to hearing from politicians.",
        "DALLAS In 2014, Diana visited our genetics clinic in Texas. She was only in her early 40s, but her mother had died of breast cancer at 42, and two of her aunts had received the same diagnosis at young ages. As we tested her for a panel of breast cancer gene mutations, she joked about her Irish heritage, of which she was clearly proud. But we discovered that Diana carried an Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA1 mutation that predisposed her to breast and ovarian cancer.",

        "Valerie Plame is a former covert CIA operations officer and the author of \u201cFair Game\u201d and several fictional spy thrillers. In a world of seemingly random massacres in Paris, Brussels and San Bernardino, Calif.; Islamic State beheadings; and an erratic potentate in a North Korea, we like to think that the CIA, the FBI and the other 14 agencies charged with gathering intelligence are doing their damnedest to keep us safe. And, for the most part, they are. But embedded within the vast U. S.",

A tragic month along the tectonic subduction zones that surround the Pacific Rim has also been a spellbinding one for seismologists.

        "CAIRO \u2014 The Islamic State\u2019s affiliate in Egypt is staging increasingly sophisticated and daring attacks, officials and analysts say, prompting Israel, Egypt and the Palestinian militant group Hamas to form an unlikely alliance against the terrorist group. Hamas deployed several hundred fighters last week to Gaza\u2019s border with Egypt\u2019s lawless northern Sinai as part of a deal with Egypt to keep militants of the Islamic State \u2014 also known as ISIS or ISIL \u2014 from entering the coastal enclave.",
        "From the time he was in grade school, Maurice Bellamy struggled to stay focused and control his temper. But within the structure of specialized private schools in Maryland, the young man seemed to show promise. He won a citizenship award for exhibiting \u201ca model of behavior and social respect,\u201d and he spoke at his graduation. He wanted to run a company and design computer games. Later, at a high school for children with learning disabilities, Bellamy passed all his classes, even earning an A in algebra.

The buildings \u2014 long ago sliced into apartments, but easily restored as grand townhomes again \u2014 composed the last major collection of brownstones in the borough that hadn\u2019t yet been gentrified going into this housing cycle, beginning in the early part of the last decade. \u201dSo there was a huge feeding frenzy for them,\u201d Stephen Smith, a New York writer behind the Market Urbanism blog, told me. The housing looks just like in popular Park Slope, but the neighborhood is a little further out.",
        "Let\u2019s try an exercise. What are the questions you should ask yourself before posting an joke on social media? Is it offensive? Racist? Does it take liberty with a man who suffered injury while in police custody and later died? Is it about a man emblematic of tensions in our country between police officers and African Americans? About a man representing a city mired in racial turmoil? A cognitively diminished man who was taken advantage of by a morally bankrupt structured settlement system? Yes, that is a very specific test. But not a hard one to pass, right?",
        "So much about the planet\u2019s future will depend on processes that humans today cannot directly observe \u2014 because they are occurring hundreds of meters below the sea surface where enormous marine glaciers, in Greenland and Antarctica, simultaneously touch the ocean and the seafloor.

        "Given that Michael Wardian had multiple pelvic stress fractures and sports hernias, one would think that his rehab would have involved a lot of quality time on the couch. But it was just the opposite. Although Wardian, a professional runner, didn\u2019t run for three months, he biked, hiked, walked and his way back to health. \u201cI wanted to maintain my fitness,\u201d said Wardian, 41, of Arlington, a 2:17 marathoner and a veteran of 150 marathons and ultramarathons. \u201cI asked detailed questions about what I could do instead of what I could not do.",
        "Many men worry unnecessarily about the first date. You drive a 2005 Civic? Got a bit of a bald spot? You\u2019re not in ? A female friend with discerning taste once shared some crucial intel for normal guys: \u201cNone of that stuff matters. Shoes, though? Shoes are important.

He has covered the Supreme Court since November 2006.
