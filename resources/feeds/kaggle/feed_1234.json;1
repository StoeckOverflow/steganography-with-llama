        "Countries usually don\u2019t knowingly commit economic suicide, but in Britain, millions seem ready to give it a try. On June 23, the United Kingdom will vote to decide whether to quit the European Union, the economic bloc with a population of 508 million and a gross domestic product of almost $17 trillion. Let\u2019s not be coy: Leaving the E. U. would be an act of national insanity. It would weaken the U. K. economy, one of Europe\u2019s strongest. The E.

        "The mainstream media are all too ready to go with the \u201cRepublicans accept Trump\u201d narrative, if only because they cannot wait to get on with the Trump vs. Hillary Clinton brawl. The unlikability of Sen.

        "EVERYONE COMPLAINS about the high cost of prescription drugs, but not many people try to do anything about it. An admirable exception is the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) which recently proposed a pilot program to change the way Medicare reimburses doctors for medications they administer directly to patients, as opposed to those distributed through pharmacies or hospitals. At present, the doctor gets the average price of a drug plus 6 percent, a clear incentive to use higher priced drugs instead of lower priced equivalents. HHS wants to make the reimbursement 2.",
        "Malia Obama\u2019s decision to take a year off before attending Harvard University in the fall of 2017 reflects a growing trend among driven teenagers to pursue other interests and get a respite from the academic grind that has come to define high school for many young Americans. But it will also provide her with a chance to experience college as the glare of the presidential spotlight has begun to ease, giving her a level of freedom that the daughters of George W. Bush and Bill Clinton did not have on their respective campuses.",

        "White House hopeful Bernie Sanders, who has fought the Democratic establishment throughout his campaign, made an extraordinary appeal Sunday for party insiders to help deliver the nomination to him, even if he doesn\u2019t catch rival Hillary Clinton in the remaining primaries and caucuses. Addressing reporters at the National Press Club in Washington, Sanders made a public plea for Democratic superdelegates to reconsider their allegiances to Clinton, particularly those in states where he has won nominating contests or those who committed to Clinton before he entered the race.",

        "Politico reported today on a Florida poll conducted for a business group in the state that shows Hillary Clinton beating Donald Trump by 13 points and Ted Cruz by nine. Why is that important? Because if Clinton wins Florida and carries the 19 states (plus D.

Here\u2019s what that map would look like: And here\u2019s the underlying math. If Clinton wins the 19 states (and D.",
        "Job prospects for college seniors about to graduate are looking up this year following an overall hiring boom, but lackluster wages and the burden of student debt might make new hires feel like they are still at a disadvantage.

        "Last June, writing in a London paper, I suggested to some of my fellow conservatives that Donald Trump might well win the GOP nomination, and that they\u2019d better stop dismissing him. \u201cTrump,\u201d I wrote, \u201chas mastered the art of saying he saw the truth before anybody else did. Whether he did or didn\u2019t \u2014 whether he even had an opinion on it until five minutes ago \u2014 is beside the point.

        "We know that Hillary Clinton believes it takes a village to raise a child. As my colleague Carlos Lozada has pointed out, 20 years since \u201cIt Takes a Village\u201d was published in 1996, the presidential candidate still draws on that village philosophy on the campaign trail. While revisiting Clinton\u2019s 2004 memoir \u201cLiving History\u201d recently, I noticed that she also relied on a village of friends and political and spiritual leaders to move past her husband\u2019s infidelity in the 1990s.",
        "Much has been made about how the ascent of GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump could affect Republicans in races further down the ballot. Now, an advertisement in Arkansas\u2019 Senate race is a preview of how Democrats are likely to tie Republican opponents who support Trump\u2019s candidacy to incendiary remarks the businessman has made in the past.

He immediately amended his remark. \u201cThere is a chance,\u201d he could support Clinton, Koch said, \u201cbut it\u2019s highly remote."
