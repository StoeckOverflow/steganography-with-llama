        "Increasingly desperate and facing a likely loss in Indiana, Ted Cruz told everyone exactly what he thinks of likely Republican nominee Donald Trump at a news conference in the Hoosier State this morning. The senator from Texas called Trump a \u201dnarcissist,\u201d a \u201dpathological liar\u201d and a \u201dphilanderer\u201d \u2014 among other things \u2014 and cast Tuesday\u2019s Republican presidential primary as a moral choice between good and evil. Cruz\u2019s strategy won\u2019t work \u2014 for one very specific reason.",
        "My neighborhood of Chevy Chase is a leafy and peaceful slice of Northwest Washington. But this week, the news here is of a woman assaulted outside the local Starbucks by a Donald Trump supporter, she says \u2014 for the sin of being Muslim. Police on Monday released surveillance video showing a heavyset white woman shouting at, and then pouring a bottle of liquid onto, a woman in a Muslim headscarf seated outside a Starbucks on a recent weeknight. Police are investigating a possible hate crime. Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation\u2019s capital.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s formal foreign policy address last week hurled a stick into the hive of the foreign policy establishment. Republican and Democrat foreign policy mavens erupted and buzzed around to attack the intruder. Anyone not reading the text would think it was a contradictory spewing of nonsense, another in the long line of Trump outrages. In fact, the reaction to the speech was far more revealing than Trump\u2019s address itself. The Clinton campaign brought out former secretary of state Madeleine Albright and Sen. Tim Kaine ( .) to respond.",
        "Now that the contours of the general election are reasonably predictable, it is time to start thinking about the tripartite institutional reckoning that should come in November\u2019s aftermath \u2014 for the media, Republicans and Democrats. For the media, the assessment is simple, and unsparing: We underperformed our constitutionally protected role. Sure, every campaign cycle features over the primacy of the horse race over the substance. Ruth Marcus is a columnist for The Post, specializing in American politics and domestic policy.

        "SARI RASH, Iraq This month marks the 100th anniversary of the Agreement that formed Iraq, Syria and the other fragile nations of the modern Middle East.

        "When Shakespeare wrote that \u201ctruth will out,\u201d he must have had Ted Cruz in mind. Cruz\u2019s truth \u2014 or his true self \u2014 has been leaking by steady drips ever since he began his candidacy, which was at approximately 12:10 p. m. on Jan. 3, 2013, when Cruz was sworn in as the freshman senator from Texas.

        "TWO PERSISTENT failings of U. S. foreign policy have been an overdependence on individual leaders, who frequently fail to deliver on American expectations, and a reluctance to accept that an established status quo can\u2019t hold. The Obama administration has committed both those errors in Iraq \u2014 and it has done so more than once. In its zeal to withdraw all U. S. troops in time for President Obama\u2019s reelection campaign in 2012, the administration threw its weight behind Minister Nouri with disastrous consequences. Mr.",
        "Nightmare stories of nurses giving potent drugs meant for one patient to another and surgeons removing the wrong body parts have dominated recent headlines about medical care. Lest you assume those cases are the exceptions, a new study by patient safety researchers provides some context. Their analysis, published in the BMJ on Tuesday, shows that \u201dmedical errors\u201d in hospitals and other health care facilities are incredibly common and may now be the third leading cause of death in the United States claiming 251, 000 lives every year, more than respiratory disease, accidents, stroke and Alzheimer\u2019s.",
        "People in pain write to Jennifer Doudna. They have a congenital illness. Or they have a sick child. Or they carry the gene for Huntington\u2019s disease or some other dreadful time bomb wired through every cell in their body. They know that Doudna helped invent an extraordinary new technology, known as CRISPR. But they don\u2019t all seek her help. One woman, the mother of a child with Down syndrome, explained: \u201cI love my child and wouldn\u2019t change him. There\u2019s something about him that\u2019s so special. He\u2019s so loving in a way that\u2019s unique to him. I wouldn\u2019t change it.",

        "MAKHMOUR, Iraq \u2014 At the base of a rocky ridge rising from the surrounding farmland, the barrels of American artillery poke out from under camouflage covers, their sights trained on Islamic positions.

        "Metro\u2019s long history of deficiencies \u2014 including poor maintenance, a loose safety culture, a blindness to potential hazards and a chronic failure to learn from previous disasters \u2014 all contributed to last year\u2019s deadly smoke crisis in a Yellow Line tunnel, federal officials said Tuesday in a report that reads like an indictment of the beleaguered transit agency. \u201cTo me, this shows that [Metro] historically speaking, has had a severe learning disability,\u201d Robert L.",

        "This story has been updated. As India, the world\u2019s populous country, reels from an intense drought, the World Bank has released a new report finding that perhaps the most severe impact of a changing climate could be the effect on water supplies. The most startling finding? The report suggests that by 2050, an inadequate supply of water could knock down economic growth in some parts of the world a figure as high as 6 percent of GDP, \u201csending them into sustained negative growth.",

        "You\u2019ve probably come across those couples where one partner is significantly more attractive than the other. It\u2019s often fodder for fictional comedy \u2014 think of oafish Homer and demure Marge in \u201dThe Simpsons,\u201d Peter and Lois Griffin in \u201dFamily Guy,\u201d or this fake article in the Onion. In real life, of course, it\u2019s also a source of pain for some couples, who may be hurt and embarrassed to hear that their partner \u201ccould do so much better than you. \u201d While there are all kinds of variations within partners, couples do go somewhat against the grain.",

        "Donald Trump has demolished just about every pillar of Republican philosophy, leaving the party to grapple with an identity crisis deeper than anything it has seen in half a century. The GOP has chosen as its 2016 a candidate who has flouted a litany of its conservative principles. Trump is disdainful of agreements, leery of foreign intervention, less than strident on social issues and a champion of protecting entitlements.",
        "For the first time since his own presidency, George H. W. Bush is planning to stay silent in the race for the Oval Office \u2014 and the younger former president Bush plans to stay silent as well.

        "It may not matter what Bernie Sanders meant this week when he promised to push for a contested convention this summer. Even with his victory in the Indiana primary Tuesday, it remains all but impossible for the senator from Vermont to win the nomination.

        "Larry Wilmore\u2019s provocative monologue at the White House correspondents\u2019 dinner Saturday is still reverberating through Washington. Beginning with his opening line welcoming guests to \u201cNegro night,\u201d the comedian brought his deadpan style of humor to the Washington Hilton\u2019s grand ballroom. Many are still buzzing about Wilmore\u2019s closing line, in which he praised President Obama for achieving what Wilmore once thought inconceivable for an African American. \u201cSo, Mr. President,\u201d he said, \u201cif I\u2019m going to keep it one hundred: Yo, Barry, you did it, my nigga. \u201d Judging by the silence and mostly crowd, Wilmore\u2019s set bombed.

        "The writer is a political theorist at Harvard University and a contributing columnist for The Post. Donald Trump has set a big, fat trap for Hillary Clinton, and so far she has stepped right into it. He turned his attacks against women against her. She is, he argued, playing the \u201cwoman card. \u201d And Clinton anted up, offering her supporters the chance to buy a \u201cwoman card. \u201d From now until Nov. 8, Trump will surely continue to insult women. If Clinton routinely responds to those attacks, Trump will turn her into the \u201cwomen\u2019s candidate,\u201d and she will lose.",

        "No one who has been paying attention to the GOP presidential race for the past couple of weeks can be surprised that Donald Trump scored a huge victory Tuesday night, prompting Sen. Ted Cruz ( .) to get out of the race. That his big win occurred on the same day as his insane accusation that Cruz\u2019s father was involved with JFK\u2019s assassination confirms the sense of many principled conservatives that the electorate has blown it and failed to discern that Trump is unfit, if not unstable, for any office, let alone the presidency.",
        "John Kasich has decided to end his bid for the presidency, ending the GOP primary campaign and leaving Donald J. Trump as the uncontested leader of the Republican Party. Needless to say, this was not part of the plan when the party decided after 2012 that it needed to make some changes in order to update its brand for the future. In fact, Trump was exactly the opposite of what it had in mind. So now that Trump has taken control of the GOP, how is the image Americans have of this party going to change?",
