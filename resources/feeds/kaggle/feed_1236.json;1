        "OTTAWA \u2014 They called it Fort McMoney. No place in Canada better exemplified the country\u2019s oil boom than Fort McMurray, a outpost in the boreal forest of northeastern Alberta that became the epicenter of the country\u2019s boom. The good times seemed as if they would never end. Drivers of heavy trucks hauling the sand could earn up to $150, 000 (Canadian) a year with overtime. The city opened a new airport to meet demand. But, as often happens with commodities, the oil boom has turned to bust.",
        "Prince was found dead at his Paisley Park compound just one day before he was supposed to meet with a doctor to help him with his alleged painkiller addiction, according to a published report. Lawyer William Mauzy told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that representatives for Prince called Howard Kornfeld, a Northern California doctor who specializes in treatment, on the night of April 20 because the renowned musician \u201cwas dealing with a grave medical emergency. \u201d The following morning, Prince\u2019s body was discovered in an elevator at his complex in Minnesota.",
        "FLINT, Mich. \u2014 President Obama arrived here Wednesday to check in on a disadvantaged city that has been denied a most elemental government service \u2014 safe drinking water \u2014 but his visit turned into an outpouring of emotion from a community aggrieved by years of neglect from its elected officials. The president\u2019s day in a city that has become a national symbol of disenfranchisement was intended to bolster confidence over a public health crisis related to toxic levels of lead contamination in Flint\u2019s tap water.",
        "Two years ago, the Washington state began an unprecedented policy experiment by allowing production and sale of recreational marijuana to the public. The effects on public health and safety and on the relationship of law enforcement to minority communities will take years to manifest fully, but one impact has become abundantly clear: Legalized marijuana is getting very cheap very quickly. Marijuana price data from Washington\u2019s Liquor and Cannabis Board was aggregated by Steve Davenport of the Pardee RAND Graduate School and Jonathan Caulkins, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University.",
        "They crisscrossed Indiana this week speaking the mishmash language of both politics and sports. In Fort Wayne, the old football coach said, \u201cCoaches know how to get things done. Donald Trump is one of the great coaches in this country. \u201d At a rally in Carmel, the player said, \u201cHe\u2019s not a politician. He\u2019s one of us. \u201d And in Evanston, the iconic basketball coach stood on the stage sporting his familiar red sweater.",
        "The marquee matchup is now in view: Clinton vs. Trump. There are still some wrinkles to be worked out \u2014 an independent (or ) challenger might shake things up, and Trump still has some work to do to secure the Republican nomination \u2014 but it\u2019s looking like the Empire State will produce its first president since FDR. Most people assume Clinton is the prohibitive favorite in this contest, and that\u2019s a fair extrapolation of current polling that shows Trump would start the race as a historically unpopular candidate.",
        "A federal judge on Wednesday directed State Department officials and top aides to Hillary Clinton to answer questions under oath by June 29 about whether they intentionally thwarted federal laws by allowing Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server throughout her tenure as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. The decision by U. S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan in Washington sets the stage for responses before July\u2019s presidential nominating conventions \u2014 but does not ensure cooperation \u2014 from at least six current and former top officials, including Cheryl D.",
        "Conservatives in the media who have opposed Donald Trump\u2019s nomination are working their way through the five stages of grief, now that the blustery real estate mogul has dispatched the last of his Republican rivals. Some who have already reached the \u201dacceptance\u201d stage are even prepared to vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton. [Some #NeverTrump types are now leaving the GOP and even backing Hillary Clinton] For those who want Trump to lose the general election \u2014 and those who are certain that he will \u2014 Leon H.",
        "In February 2016 President Obama called for the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. Soon after Ricardo Mir de Francia, a journalist for the Barcelona newspaper El Periodico de Catalunya, and ten other journalists traveled to Cuba on a trip organized by the Pentagon. Mir de Francia was struck by how similar the naval base felt to the suburban America he had seen in the States \u2014 a McDonald\u2019s close by, an open air cinema at night, a beach on which to lounge on a day off.",
        "In an extraordinary rebuke of the Republican Party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) the nation\u2019s GOP official, said Thursday that he could not support Donald Trump until he changes his tone and demonstrates that he shares the party\u2019s values. While acknowledging that Trump has mobilized a powerful movement and earned the nomination, Ryan said that Trump has not shown himself to be \u201ca who bears our standard\u201d \u2014 and he put the onus on the business mogul to recalibrate his campaign and offer a more inclusive vision.",
        "Prosecutors and FBI agents investigating Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email server have so far found scant evidence that the leading Democratic presidential candidate intended to break classification rules, though they are still probing the case aggressively with an eye on interviewing Clinton herself, according to U. S. officials familiar with the matter. FBI agents on the case have been joined by federal prosecutors from the same office that successfully prosecuted conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui \u2014 and who would handle any Edward Snowden case, should he ever return to the country, according to the U. S.",
        "Two months after Osama bin Laden was killed, the CIA\u2019s top operative in Pakistan was pulled out of the country in an abrupt move vaguely attributed to health concerns and his strained relationship with Islamabad. In reality, the CIA station chief was so violently ill that he was often doubled over in pain, current and former U. S. officials said. Trips out of the country for treatment proved futile. And the cause of his ailment was so mysterious, the officials said, that both he and the agency began to suspect that he had been poisoned.",
        "What lies behind Donald Trump\u2019s nomination victory? Received wisdom among conservatives is that he, the outsider, sensed, marshaled and came to represent a massive revolt of the Republican rank and file against the \u201cestablishment. \u201d This is the narrative: GOP political leaders made promises of all kinds and received in return, during President Obama\u2019s years, major electoral victories that gave them the House, the Senate, 12 new governorships and 30 statehouses. Yet they didn\u2019t deliver. Exit polls consistently showed that a majority of GOP primary voters (60 percent in some states) feel \u201cbetrayed\u201d by their leaders.",
        "The Republican Party this week is like Rome must have been after the Visigoths stormed the city\u2019s gates. Anarchy and confusion reign, there is the sound of anguished wailing, and political leaders are making an urgent calculation: Resistance or collaboration? The suddenness of Donald Trump\u2019s final victory over the GOP establishment was shocking. On Monday, Pollyannas were still convincing themselves that Trump could be thwarted at a contested convention. Within 48 hours, he had won the Indiana primary in a landslide and his last two opponents, Ted Cruz and John Kasich, had surrendered.",
        "James Downie is The Post\u2019s digital opinions editor. Father Daniel Berrigan died Saturday at 94. The longtime peace activist gained national attention in 1968 when he and eight others, including his brother Philip (also a priest) burned draft records taken from a Selective Service office in Maryland. Decades later, he remains a powerful example of a man who never wavered in his beliefs, standing up time and again for the poor and oppressed. In his last years, Berrigan no longer had the energy to protest as frequently.",
        "At the heart of Donald Trump\u2019s appeal is his fame as a successful businessman. It\u2019s why most of his supporters don\u2019t worry about his political views or his crude rhetoric and behavior. He\u2019s a great chief executive and will get things done. No one believes this more than Trump himself, who argues that his prowess in the commercial world amply prepares him for the presidency. \u201cIn fact I think in many ways building a great business is actually harder,\u201d he told GQ last year. There is some debate about Trump\u2019s record as a businessman.",
        "Rania Al Abdullah is queen of Jordan. In his novel \u201cBlindness,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Saramago asks us to imagine a world where one by one, people lose their sight. The epidemic triggers apocalyptic scenes of panic, cruelty, disorder and, eventually, the breakdown of society. It\u2019s fiction, of course. After all, how could the whole world go blind? That\u2019s what I used to think. After visiting the Kara Tepe camp in Lesbos, Greece, last week to meet a group of refugees and to support the work of the International Rescue Committee, I think truth could be stranger than fiction.",
        "APOLOGISTS FOR Egyptian strongman Abdel Fatah say the brutal repression he has unleashed since leading a 2013 military coup is necessary to combat domestic terrorists, including a branch of the Islamic State. That does not explain why dozens of secular liberal democrats have been imprisoned, nor why journalists, civil society groups, human rights activists and even an Italian doctoral student have become targets for security forces and prosecutors. It also does not explain an underpublicized but ugly crackdown on a community that has nothing to do with Islamist extremism: gay and transgender people.",
        "Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told my colleague Robert Costa that he is eager to start meeting with U. S. intelligence officials for classified briefings on the nation\u2019s secrets. The feeling may not be mutual. The outlandish GOP candidate is not known for discretion or nuanced understanding of global security issues, let alone awareness of the widespread revulsion among U. S. intelligence officials over some of Trump\u2019s positions \u2014 including his expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin and pledge to resume torturing terrorism suspects. Where should the U. S. intelligence community\u2019s first PowerPoint presentation for Trump begin?",
        "The commutes of hundreds of thousands of residents will be upended when Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld on Friday unveils his plan for a massive overhaul of the struggling rail system. Wiedefeld will make the announcement at a news conference at the agency s downtown headquarters after he briefs Metro board members. Although he declined to publicly disclose details of the plan before Friday, Wiedefeld said in an interview that the scope of the maintenance overhaul will be unprecedented for the transit agency.",
        "For a quarter of a century, the federal rule dictating how communities test for and control lead in drinking water has satisfied virtually no one. For the past six years, the Environmental Protection Agency has been trying to rewrite its complex, controversial regulations. And for the past six months, while the crisis in Flint, Mich. became a national embarrassment, the pressure built to finish the job. There is widespread agreement that major changes are well overdue for the Lead and Copper Rule, which governs about 68, 000 public water systems and affects the health of millions of Americans.",
        "Ken Shupe responded to a woman who was stranded on an interstate in North Carolina on Monday. Shupe is a tow truck driver; the woman had been involved in a wreck, according to reports. But when Shupe arrived, he noticed something about the woman\u2019s car \u2014 specifically, he noticed that the woman was a supporter of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, according to Fox Carolina. \u201cEvery business dealing in recent history that I\u2019ve had with a person, I haven\u2019t got paid,\u201d Shupe told the station.",
        "The prevailing wisdom in political circles following Donald Trump\u2019s emergence as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is that he has very little chance of beating Hillary Clinton in the fall election. That she and her team of experienced operatives will carve Trump up like a Thanksgiving turkey, using his many controversial remarks to build a case that he is fundamentally unfit for the office he is seeking. That her political experience will turn him into a blubbering fool, both on the campaign trail and on the debate stage. Might happen. Could happen.",
        "PALMYRA, Syria \u2014 At an ancient Roman amphitheater where just months ago the Islamic State staged mass beheadings, Russia on Thursday deployed a celebrated conductor and a renowned cellist on a cultural offensive to mark the liberation of Palmyra and re inforce Russia\u2019s role in Syria. In place of the warplanes and special forces fighting here in March, President Vladimir Putin sent the Mariinsky Orchestra led by conductor Valery Gergiev and joined by cellist Sergei Roldugin, one of Putin\u2019s close friends and a subject of recent leaks about secret offshore holdings. The symbolism was lost on no one.",
        "You lose weight, and then you gain it all back. That grim reality is a mainstay of our obese society. But a new study of contestants from the reality TV show \u201cThe Biggest Loser\u201d suggests that, for them, that was all but . Contestants were severely obese and exercised and dieted competitively for 30 weeks. The unusual circumstances (most of us don\u2019t lose weight with the whole world watching) led to unusual weight loss \u2014 over 100 pounds on average.",
        "Keenan Reynolds was selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the sixth round of the NFL draft, and like any the former Navy quarterback will have to fight for a permanent spot on the roster. But even if he makes it, his ties to the Navy may not allow him to suit up come August.",
        "The NCAA has become a black market. At some point, Laremy Tunsil\u2019s petty, common, transactions as a college football player at Mississippi metastasized into something else, something that looks suspiciously like a smear campaign and a blackmail attempt. This is the ultimate ill of an system that earns millions for everyone but the players: It left a vulnerable to a vengeful shyster operating in an underworld.",
        "Traditional party in Timimoun, Algeria. (Arnaud of Les \u00c9ditions de Juillet) A cassette tape weighs about three ounces. It can be slipped into a pocket, into the thick folds of a robe, copied again and again, until the smooth edges of a voice frazzles into shreds. During the Tuareg uprising of the 1990s in Mali and Niger in favor of a separate you could be thrown into jail for possessing one. These cassettes contained the thrilling musical beginnings of desert blues sensation Tinariwen.",
        "One recent afternoon, President Obama sat down for lunch with seven former prisoners at the Washington restaurant and bookstore Busboys and Poets. He had just commuted the sentences of 61 inmates and was listening to the stories of other who had been granted clemency. Obama was clearly moved by what he heard. \u201cIt does not make sense for a nonviolent drug offender to be getting 20 years, 30 years, in some cases life, in prison,\u201d Obama said at the lunch. \u201cThat\u2019s not serving anybody.",
        "LONDON \u2014 After a bitter and bruising race, the Labour Party\u2019s Sadiq Khan won London\u2019s mayoral race early Saturday and made history as the first Muslim elected to lead a major Western capital city. The outcome is likely to resonate far beyond a change in London\u2019s City Hall, challenging the rise of political rhetoric in the West and giving another powerful voice to Britain\u2019s large Pakistani community just when the country is facing its own identity crisis. Khan, who takes over as mayor of a city of 8."
