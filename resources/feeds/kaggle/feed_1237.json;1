        "Two of Donald Trump\u2019s defeated rivals said Friday that they will not support him in the general election, predicting disaster for the party and asking conservatives to focus on electing Republicans to offices down the ballot. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, whom Trump had treated with utter contempt during primary season, announced his decision in a Facebook post. Dismissing Democratic Hillary Clinton as an \u201duntrustworthy liberal politician,\u201d Bush said he would \u201dsupport principled conservatives at the state and federal levels, just as I have done my entire life.\u201d To Bush, that does not include Trump.",

        "In the 2016 election cycle, two things have happened simultaneously. Conservatives need to separate the two in order to understand the fix they are in and how to work their way out of it. First, an unstable, thuggish demagogue arrived on the scene. In the wasteland of American culture, where manners and civic education have deteriorated, he seized the imagination of alienated, economically stressed Americans, turning their anxiety into hatred of foreigners and breeding a certain nihilism.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: This morning on Fox, Donald Trump professed himself \u201csurprised\u201d that House Speaker Paul Ryan has now said he is not yet ready to endorse the Donald. But this isn\u2019t really surprising at all. As a new Politico piece explaining Ryan\u2019s thinking puts it, Ryan was simply trying to bolster his House majority. Declining to embrace Trump will hopefully give House Republicans in the swing districts that will determine how large that majority is next year \u201ca measure of cover from Trump\u2019s unpopularity.",

        "Lots of women look forward to motherhood \u2014 getting to know a tiny baby, raising a growing child, developing a relationship with a maturing son or daughter. All over the world, people believe that parenting is the most rewarding part of life. And it\u2019s good that so many mothers treasure that bond with their child, because the transition to parenthood causes profound changes in a woman\u2019s marriage and her overall happiness \u2026 and not for the better.

        "In the land of the pusillanimous, the ambivalent speaker is king.

Lesher was moonlighting, patrolling the apartment complex on foot with a partner, another female officer. Lesher saw the door on the of a spare, building. The officers were immediately suspicious. Who would leave their door open on a cold December evening? The white officers climbed the stairs and saw Ellison, a black man, sitting on his couch inside. In front of him was a coffee table, its glass top broken. Standing outside the apartment, they asked Ellison whether he was okay.",

        "For decades, scientists thought that the story of human evolution was fairly straightforward: We and our primate ancestors evolved in Africa over millions of years, then started crossing continents and traversing seas to reach all the places we\u2019re found today. Simple (ish). But then, in the 1990s, researchers in China made a surprising discovery: The fossil of a tiny creature that was some 10 million years older than anything that had been found in Africa. The ancestors of apes, and ultimately us, seemed to have come from Asia. But they hadn\u2019t stayed there.",

        "One of President Obama\u2019s top national security advisers led journalists to believe a misleading timeline of U. S. negotiations with Iran over a agreement and relied on inexperienced reporters to create an \u201cecho chamber\u201d that helped sway public opinion to seal the deal, according to a lengthy magazine profile.

S. government debt less than they were owed \u201dif the economy crashed,\u201d raising doubts about whether Treasury bonds would be reliable in a future administration. The comments were striking because, historically, U. S. government debt has been treated as sacrosanct, the safest investment in the world, and a pillar of global financial stability.

        "House Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s refusal to endorse presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump sent the ongoing debate over whether the real estate billionaire can unite the party against Hillary Clinton in the fall election into overdrive.

        "The Federal Transit Administration, citing Metro\u2019s botched response to Thursday\u2019s fire at the Federal Center SW station, on Saturday issued a series of emergency directives to the transit agency and threatened to shut down all or parts of the nation\u2019s subway unless it took \u201curgent action\u201d to ensure passenger safety.

        "At the Fact Checker, we have often said we do not write fact checks to change the behavior of politicians. Fact checks are intended to inform voters and explain complicated issues. Still, most politicians will drop a talking point if it gets labeled with Four Pinocchios by The Fact Checker or \u201cPants on Fire\u201d by PolitiFact. No one wants to be tagged as a liar or misinformed, and we have found most politicians are interested in getting the facts straight.

        "LOUISVILLE \u2014 Right until the end, they picked at Nyquist. Too slow. Not bred to run the distance. But those who believed in him \u2014 none more than trainer Doug O\u2019Neill and owner Paul Reddam \u2014 felt all the doubters missed the point. Nyquist deserved to be the Kentucky Derby favorite because he had answered every question asked of him as a racehorse.

        "It wasn\u2019t precisely an act of moral courage, but House Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s (Wis.) comment that he\u2019s not ready to support presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump was at least . . . something. Whether it\u2019s a start or a finish remains to be revealed, but it would seem that we\u2019re witnessing the beginning of the end. To wit: A Republican friend, who has abandoned her work of getting conservatives elected, called me recently to express her condolences. \u201cI feel sorry for you,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause you (given your job) can\u2019t ignore the collapse of Western civilization.",

When I learned last year that I would be going to northeastern Nigeria, I was more afraid of what my mother would say than I was of encountering Boko Haram militants. I broke the news to her over the phone two weeks before I was to leave. I held my breath as I finished telling her about my plans. \u201cYou know how I feel about Nigeria,\u201d she said, after a pause, with an exasperated sigh.

On Thursday evening, a man \u2014 with dark, curly hair, olive skin and an exotic foreign accent \u2014 boarded a plane. It was a regional jet making a short, uneventful hop from Philadelphia to nearby Syracuse. Or so dozens of unsuspecting passengers thought.

        "Super Bowl XXV matched the New York Giants against football\u2019s most explosive offensive machine, Jim Kelly\u2019s Buffalo Bills. The Bills were fearsome on offense and as talented scoring touchdowns as Whitney Houston was singing the Star Spangled Banner during that game\u2019s ceremonies. Buffalo\u2019s no huddle offense rolled over almost every defense it faced and shredded the Los Angeles Raiders in the AFC Championship Game. Bill Parcells\u2019s plodding New York Giants were less than inspiring during their playoff matchups, limping into the Super Bowl despite failing to score a touchdown in their own NFC championship game.",
        "Stephen Stromberg is a member of The Post\u2019s editorial board. Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee Tuesday night, turning his sights on Hillary Clinton, who, he says, will be easy to beat.

But Democrats must avoid making a similar mistake, dismissing Trump based on his historically high negative poll numbers without understanding why people are voting for him. Imagine a Trump supporter.",
