That woman was one of two allegedly approached by a gunman on the run who was attempting to carjack their SUVs, court records show. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding.

Samuels\u2019s massive New York Times magazine profile of Rhodes, President Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, is already prompting debates over the administration\u2019s truthfulness in promoting the Iran nuclear deal, as well as over the disdain with which Rhodes regards the Washington press corps, the U.

        "On Friday alone, two of the men who ran against Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination said they not only wouldn\u2019t endorse him but that they wouldn\u2019t even be voting for him in the general election. Lindsey Graham went first, summing up his sentiments in two tweets. I also cannot in good conscience support Donald Trump because I do not believe he is a reliable Republican conservative. ...(4) \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) May 6, 2016 . ....",
        "Former GOP Rep. Tom Davis spent decades not only navigating the dynamic of a swing Northern Virginia congressional seat but also trying to build up Republican numbers in the House as head of the party\u2019s campaign arm. I reached out to him to get his perspective on the rise of Donald Trump and how much trouble it will cause for Republicans. Our conversation, conducted via email and edited only for grammar, is below. FIX: Put your hat on. Was there any way the GOP establishment could have seen Donald Trump coming? Why or why not?",
        "There\u2019s an alternate reality some like to imagine, a world without processed food in which everyone would be healthier and happier. Only they don\u2019t imagine it well. Or rather, they don\u2019t picture it in its purest form. The term is thrown at the likes of McDonald\u2019s, Burger King, and TV dinners, but it means so much more than that. To understand what life would be like without any processed food, you would have to go back more than 3 million years, not merely a few decades.",

Well, it is about that \u2014 and so much more.

        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s official campaign platform is now twice as long as \u201cHamlet\u201d: thousand six hundred words of policy ideas. One hundred pages. And growing. But, at its heart, this wordy list amounts to a statement of Clinton\u2019s confidence in two things. The status quo. And the federal bureaucracy. The other two candidates left in this presidential race want to overhaul American government. Clinton mainly wants to tinker with its parts. In many cases, her plans involve adding small \u2014 but intricate \u2014 new tasks for the bureaucracy, designed to make government smarter, more generous and more just.",

        "I have never voted. By the time I was 18, I had a felony shoplifting conviction, which meant that I forever lost my right to vote in Virginia. I never had a chance.

        "In 2010, the police department in Rutledge, Tenn. was riven by scandal. The police chief, a department veteran, had been charged with assault and was under investigation by state authorities. But that wasn\u2019t what Mayor Danny Turley cited when he fired the top cop that year. Turley \u201chad no choice,\u201d he said \u2014 his \u201chands were tied\u201d \u2014 because the city could have lost its liability insurance if the chief kept his job.

        "In March, a Carnegie Mellon University study confirmed what any casual observer of the primaries already knew: Donald Trump uses the simplest language among the candidates and Bernie Sanders the most complex.

        "My four children were born more than 20 years ago. I had four birth experiences, and I think about those experiences rarely, if ever. In nearly 30 years of motherhood, those acute hours quickly faded into insignificance compared with the reality of my children\u2019s daily lives, their milestones, their achievements, their personalities, their challenges and the growth of our relationship as they changed from infants to children to teenagers to adults. I gave birth vaginally.",
        "In the past few decades, motherhood has been transformed. A majority of moms now work outside the home; they also spend twice as much time on housework and child care as fathers do.

        "It was 1913, and the Civil War had been over for 48 years. The United Daughters of the Confederacy, an organization that worked to populate the South with Confederate war memorials, decided such a monument should be erected in Rockville, Md.

        "Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. last week showed he has no intention of inserting himself into the current political controversy over filling the seat on the Supreme Court left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. But in a answer to a question in an Embassy Suites ballroom in northwest Arkansas, Roberts made clear what he does consider his job to be as the nation s 17th chief justice: a fierce defender of the judiciary s independence and a firm believer in judicial restraint \u201d albeit a kind that at times is apparent only to him.",

Manziel, whose partying ways led to his release by the Cleveland Browns and helped cause sponsors and two agents to drop him, was indicted Thursday on a misdemeanor domestic violence charge.
