        "EUGENE, Ore. \u2014 At a campaign rally here in one of the most liberal towns in America, Donald Trump offered praise for an unusual party: avowed democratic socialist Bernie Sanders. \u201cNow, I\u2019m no fan of Bernie Sanders, but he is 100 percent right,\u201d Trump told a crowd here this weekend. \u201cHe is 100 percent right: Hillary Clinton is totally controlled by the people that put up her money. She\u2019s totally controlled by Wall Street. \u201d That\u2019s not the only area where the presumptive Republican nominee sounds like Sanders, who is challenging Clinton for the Democratic nomination.",
        "Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s attitude toward Donald Trump could spark a more competitive race for his own House seat in Wisconsin. \u201cI think Paul Ryan is soon to be Cantored,\u201d former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin said in a Sunday CNN interview, referring to the shocking 2014 ouster of Eric Cantor, the sitting House majority leader, in a Virginia GOP primary. Palin brought national attention to the insurgent campaign of businessman Paul Nehlen, who is challenging Ryan (R) in the Aug.",
        "Len Gotshalk, an Atlanta Falcons football player turned Oregon businessman, had a history of legal issues by the time he went looking to buy an offshore company in 2010. Lawsuits and criminal filings had accused the former NFL offensive lineman of fraud and racketeering. Mossack Fonseca, a law firm that specializes in selling offshore companies, initially told Gotshalk that it couldn\u2019t do business with him, because of \u201cnegative information\u201d that its researchers had found.",
        "The first salvo was a missile launch by the Chinese in 2007 that blew up a dead satellite and littered space with thousands of pieces of debris. But it was another Chinese launch three years ago that made the Pentagon really snap to attention, opening up the possibility that outer space would become a new front in modern warfare.",
        "MAUJE JAWALWADI, India \u2014 The teenage girl, dressed in pink, sits in the dirt before six community elders. In a scene captured on a cellphone video, one of the men wags his finger angrily at her. He rages: This girl must be punished. A villager ties her waist with rope, holding the other end, and lifts a tree branch into the air. She bows her head. The first lash comes, then another, then another. Ten in all. She lets out a wail. Eventually the crowd starts murmuring, \u201cEnough, enough,\u201d although nobody moves to stop the beating.",
        "We suspect that when he gave Donald Trump the opportunity to unify the party, Speaker of the House Paul D. Ryan ( .) knew Trump wouldn\u2019t be able to do it. Someone as narcissistic and as devoid of conservative principles as Trump couldn\u2019t become a conciliatory, minimally coherent Republican. Still, he probably did not expect Trump to blow it so quickly and vividly. In the space of a few days, Trump\u2019s campaign chief, Paul Manafort, told movement conservatives that the agenda of the GOP is now whatever Trump believes (which varies from day to day).",
        "Julia Ioffe has filed a report with the D. C. police department over the threats that she received \u2014 many from apparent Trump supporters \u2014 after writing a penetrating profile of Melania Trump in GQ. The alleged offense is listed as \u201cthreat to kidnap or injure a person,\u201d as outlined under the Code of the District of Columbia . Said threats came through phone calls and email, notes the report.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: There\u2019s a lot of chatter out there to the effect that Donald Trump is shifting his stances on taxing the rich and on the minimum wage. He\u2019s moderating his positions for the general election! He\u2019s going to get to Hillary Clinton\u2019s left on economic issues! The only problem with this reading \u2014 which is based largely on what Trump said on the Sunday shows yesterday \u2014 is that it didn\u2019t actually happen.",
        "THE 16 young West Point cadets had reason to be proud. They had just completed four years of arduous intellectual and physical education at the U. S. Military Academy a program that few are qualified to enter, let alone complete. So they celebrated their accomplishment, much as other people do when they score a touchdown or sink a long putt. But these cadets are black women, and that, sadly, has opened them up to criticism and scrutiny.",

He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000. View Archive Facebook Google+ RSS \u201cIn this election, I do not support either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton,\u201d said Rep. Ileana ( . ). Some are making new plans. \u201cI cannot support Donald Trump,\u201d said Sen. Ben Sasse ( .) calling for a choice.",
        "Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) has attracted a passionate following because he is selling his followers a fantasy. And not just any fantasy \u2014 but one of epic proportions. A group of respected, nonpartisan experts offered the public a sense of the scale on Monday, releasing the most thorough analysis yet on Sanders\u2019s plan and finding that it is profoundly flawed. Before the Democrats agree to adopt his agenda, a price they might pay to get him to end his doomed campaign, they should be clear about what they are signing onto.",
        "North Carolina and the Justice Department announced dueling lawsuits Monday over the state\u2019s \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d which has become the epicenter of a larger fight over transgender rights. The two complaints, filed several hours apart, took opposing sides in the debate over the law, which bans transgender people from using bathrooms that don\u2019t match the gender on their birth certificates. While the state said its law does not discriminate against transgender people or treat transgender employees differently from employees, the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights office said the measure is discriminatory and violates civil rights.",
        "At the age of 16, Heather Troupe received a diagnosis of chronic severe depression and a prescription for an antidepressant. Eight years and 20 pounds later, she was sleeping poorly, felt a lot of anxiety and had lost her therapist because of insurance complications. Looking to \u201cfix herself,\u201d as Troupe, of Knoxville, Tenn. put it, she began using an elliptical machine every day at the gym, hoping to sweat away what was ailing her. Today, Troupe, 33, has been for nine years and credits her daily exercise habits with helping her achieve mental health.",
        "Krispy Kreme Doughnuts said Monday that it has agreed to be acquired by a private investment company in a deal valued at about $1. 35 billion, a move that would bring the chain into a growing breakfast empire. The buyer, JAB Beech, is a subsidiary of a company called JAB that recently acquired Keurig Green Mountain for about $14 billion. JAB also owns controlling stakes in chains Peets Coffee & Tea, Caribou Coffee, as well as Einstein Noah Restaurant Group, the company behind Einstein Bros. Bagels.",
        "The global United Methodist Church begins its legislative meeting Tuesday, and the focus has been on whether to change or keep the denomination\u2019s rejection of homosexuality. But a broader question is up for a vote: What do the 13 million Methodists from Africa to Asia to America have in common? In a globalized, polarized time, it\u2019s a question that could be asked of many faith groups, from Catholics and Jews to Muslims and Mormons.",
        "In what has seemed like a foregone conclusion since the Golden State Warriors began the season Steph Curry will receive the NBA\u2019s MVP award for a second straight season, according to multiple media reports Monday. The announcement could be officially made as soon as Tuesday, and the only apparent question at this point is whether the player will become the first in league history to win the award unanimously. Curry followed up last season\u2019s stellar campaign, which not only included his first MVP trophy but also the Warriors\u2019 first NBA championship in 40 years, in fashion.",
        "Lisa Lumpkins was scrolling Facebook when she first saw the photo. In her newsfeed, a group that identified older children in need of adoption had posted a picture of a teenage Chinese girl who looked strikingly like her own daughter. The image bore into her mind and she couldn\u2019t shake it. She thought maybe she was imagining the similarity. So she shared the post on her personal page and almost instantly close family and friends were messaging her: That girl looks a lot like Aubrey. Lumpkins and her husband, Gene, lived a comfortable life in Georgetown, Ky.",
        "Four diners, three of them wearing plaid, were ready to enjoy a meal Saturday night at Peter Chang in Arlington, the authentic Sichuan outpost opened by the Chinese embassy chef turned serial restaurateur. But the dinner took a left turn when the server brought out a bowl of rice. One of the diners, who had lived in Beijing for much of the 2000s, was surprised by the rice presentation and made a comment to the server, saying \u201d\u2019Oh, you guys don\u2019t serve them in individual rice bowls?",
        "Sen. Bernie Sanders has proposed paying for his policies that transform large sectors of the government and the economy mainly through increased taxes on wealthy Americans. A pair of new studies published Monday suggests Sanders would not come up with enough money using this approach, and that the poor and the middle class would have to pay more than Sanders has projected in order to fund his ideas.",
        "The road that Hillary Clinton hopes to take to the White House travels right through suburban Virginia and places like it: diverse, moderate and burgeoning with young families. Clinton\u2019s campaign stop Monday afternoon at Mug \u2019n Muffin coffeehouse in Loudoun County offered a window into her strategy to win those voters. She largely ignored presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump and focused instead on issues for suburban families: costs, paid family leave, college tuition. But the strategy is a tacit, critique of Clinton\u2019s likely opponent, for whom policy has been a secondary feature.",
        "Democratic Hillary Clinton may have found a purpose to the string of primaries against Bernie Sanders this month that she is expected to lose: to connect with white voters who may be crucial in a against Donald Trump. Polls have consistently shown Clinton trailing Sanders not only in Tuesday\u2019s primary in West Virginia, but also in Kentucky and Oregon a week later \u2014 and Washington the week after that. Those losses are not expected to cut significantly into Clinton\u2019s lead in the Democratic nominating process.",
        "This post has been updated with Ted Cruz\u2019s comments to reporters Tuesday, his first full day back in the Senate. Last week, Ted Cruz made one of the biggest decisions of his political career: To essentially hand the 2016 Republican nomination to his rival, Donald Trump. This week, the Texas senator returns to his day job on Capitol Hill facing a decision that carries perhaps just as much weight: whether to continue being an obstructor to official Washington or to try to work within official Washington. What tack Cruz decides to take could shape his political future.",
        "The Justice Department announced Tuesday that it will not seek the death penalty against Ahmed Abu Khattala, 54, a U. S. terrorist whom prosecutors accuse of leading the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans. The announcement, contained in a notice to the federal trial court in Washington, clears the way for a major terrorism trial in the nation\u2019s capital, the first in the United States since 2015, barring a plea agreement by Abu Khattala.",

View Archive Facebook RSS I stand before you today with a heavy heart, to say that I cannot in good conscience support the man my party appears to have chosen to be its nominee for the presidency. As a result, I will be asking Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus to release me from the role of serving as convention chairman in Cleveland.",
        "Don\u2019t look now, but Donald Trump may be confounding political expectations again. On Tuesday morning a slew of state and national polls were released that put the presumptive GOP nominee within sights of Hillary Clinton. If today\u2019s surveys hint at a coming trend, then all that talk about Trump\u2019s general election ceiling is as worthless as the months of talk predicting the same during the Republican primary season. Tuesday\u2019s NBC Monkey tracking poll has Clinton ahead of Trump by five points, but that is far closer than the lead the Democratic enjoyed last week in a poll.",
        "Focus groups of swing voters have picked up some warning signs for Democrats about Donald Trump\u2019s general election candidacy: While those swing voters are willing to see Trump as a risky, divisive figure, they are not yet prepared to believe the Dem argument that Trump\u2019s policy proposals would benefit the rich, a senior Democratic strategist who has been directly involved in extensive focus groups tells me. The findings in these focus groups present Democrats with both challenges and opportunities as they prepare for a very harsh general election campaign against Trump.",
        "The great Republican crackup has begun. There is a growing group of Donald Trump partisans, including former House speaker Newt Gingrich, Rush Limbaugh and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Then there are Republican officials who publicly support Trump and privately hope he will lose in November \u2014 a group that could only be counted via lie detector, but I would test Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell first. And there are Trump opponents and skeptics, including the 41st president, the 43rd president, Jeb Bush, Mitt Romney, Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan.",
        "I am so sorry that I am writing about Donald Trump every day. I did not ask for this life, either. It does not bring me any more pleasure than it brings you. HOWEVER. The Post recently studied the sexual history of Donald Trump and concluded that he could go \u201cfrom playboy to president\u201d (which was, I think, the cover story of every magazine in the 1950s, generally with a man with hair on the cover who resembled Don Draper.) If it feels outdated, that\u2019s because it is. But it\u2019s also familiar.",

        "The National Institutes of Health is overhauling the leadership of its flagship hospital after an independent review concluded that patient safety had become \u201csubservient to research demands\u201d on the agency\u2019s sprawling Bethesda campus. The at the NIH Clinical Center, which was announced to staff Tuesday, represents the most significant restructuring at the nation\u2019s premier biomedical research institution in more than half a century.
