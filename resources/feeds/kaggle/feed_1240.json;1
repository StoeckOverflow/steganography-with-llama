        "Near the beginning of a recent interview, an FBI investigator broached a topic with longtime Hillary Clinton aide Cheryl Mills that her lawyer and the Justice Department had agreed would be off limits, according to several people familiar with the matter. Mills and her lawyer left the room \u2014 though both returned a short time later \u2014 and prosecutors were somewhat taken aback that their FBI colleague had ventured beyond what was anticipated, the people said. Investigators consider Mills \u2014 who served as chief of staff while Clinton was secretary of state \u2014 to be a cooperative witness.",
        "A federal judge on Tuesday blocked Staples\u2019 $6. 3 billion acquisition of Office Depot, siding with regulators who argued the merger of office supply titans would reduce competition and raise prices. The companies said they would not appeal the decision and would instead abandon the deal.

        "On Monday, there was a remarkable moment at the Department of Justice: two women of color who had personally experienced the pain of prejudice walked to the podium to announce the Justice Department\u2019s discrimination lawsuit against the state of North Carolina. The two top Justice Department officials \u2014 one the daughter of Indian immigrants and the other the granddaughter of a \u201cdirt poor\u201d sharecropper and minister in the deep South \u2014 linked the growing controversy over transgender access to restrooms in North Carolina to the civil rights battles of the 1960s.",
        "SAO PAULO, Brazil \u201d As she desperately fights off impeachment, President Dilma Rousseff sometimes compares her removal to the military overthrow of a government in 1964. Rousseff has personal reasons for this: She suffered brutal torture in that period for her role in a Marxist guerrilla group. But, as she faces the more prosaic accusation that she broke budget rules, she also seeks to rally her party s base, casting the current dispute as the latest chapter in a perennial battle between elites and workers.",
        "MADISON, Wis. \u2014 Long before Flint, Mich. faced a crisis, this city dealt with one of its own. The local utility had sampled residents\u2019 tap water in accordance with the federal government\u2019s new Lead and Copper Rule and discovered unacceptable levels of lead. But Madison\u2019s response was like hitting a gnat with a sledgehammer. It was so aggressive that only one other major municipality in the United States has followed its approach so far. It\u2019s also why some people now call Madison the a place where water problems linked to the toxic substance simply couldn\u2019t happen today.",
        "Wealthy parents are famously pouring more and more into their children, widening the gap in who has access to piano lessons and math tutors and French language camp. The biggest investment the rich can make in their kids, though \u2014 one with equally profound consequences for the poor \u2014 has less to do with \u201denrichment\u201d than real estate.

Hillary Clinton pledged Tuesday that as president she would ensure that families pay no more than 10 percent of income on child care, and accused Republican rival of encouraging a \u201drace to the bottom\u201d in services for working Americans. \u201dDonald Trump actually stood on a debate stage and argued that Americans are being paid too much, not too little,\u201d she said following a tour of a family medical and social services clinic here.

        "This post has been updated. Last summer, shortly after Donald Trump launched his angry missile of a campaign with that memorable remark about Mexicans and rapists, Kayleigh McEnany sounded like pretty much every other talking head on cable news. \u201cI think he said something very unartful, very inappropriate,\u201d she told Don Lemon during a June 29 segment on \u201cCNN Tonight. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you, he\u2019s not going to be anywhere near the top five,\u201d McEnany added. \u201cHe\u2019s not a serious contender within the Republican Party.",
        "(Rene Koster) Wanderlust and the desire to seek out beauty and adventure have been part of human nature since the beginning of time.

        "Five years ago, Rep. Paul Ryan stood on the House floor, assured of victory. \u201cThis is our defining moment,\u201d he said. On that day in 2011, the House\u2019s new GOP majority approved Ryan\u2019s budget plan \u2014 which, in defiance of all political instincts, called for cuts in a government program that voters knew and loved: Medicare.

        "Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign is spurring a record number of citizenship applications and increases in voter registration among Latinos upset by the candidate\u2019s rhetoric and fearful of his plans to crack down on immigration. Activists, lawmakers and political consultants around the country say Hispanics are flooding into citizenship workshops and congressional offices and jamming hotlines on how to become U. S. citizens or register to vote. Many say they are primarily motivated by the rise of Trump, who has proposed deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants and building a wall on the U. S. border.",
        "Donald Trump is in the midst of a \u201ccongratulations to me\u201d media tour \u2014 granting a series of interviews in which he touts how well he has done, how smart he is and, by comparison, how dumb everyone who said he couldn\u2019t win the Republican nomination is. Which is his right. And, given how long the odds were that Trump would conquer 16 other candidates to become the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, a valedictory lap might even be in order.",
