        "For 22 years the region known as a 3700 independent, mostly Armenian area nestled inside Azerbaijan, has remained relatively peaceful. A brutal war there from during the dissolution of the former Soviet Union left somnolent scars in a place known as a \u201cfrozen conflict\u201d zone in the diplomatic world. Tension between Turkey and Russia over the Syrian refugee crisis may have thawed that fragile peace as war erupted for five days in April. Families fled. The prime minister called contractual soldiers to Stepanakert for deployment instructions. Secretary of State John Kerry called for restraint.",
        "American Special Operations troops have been stationed at two outposts in eastern and western Libya since late 2015, tasked with lining up local partners in advance of a possible offensive against the Islamic State, U. S. officials said. Two teams totaling fewer than 25 troops are operating from around the cities of Misurata and Benghazi to identify potential allies among local armed factions and gather intelligence on threats, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive mission overseas. The insertion of a tiny group of U. S.",
        "A federal judge struck down a portion of President Obama\u2019s signature Affordable Care Act health law Thursday, ruling that Obama exceeded his authority in unilaterally funding a provision that sent billions of dollars in subsidies to health insurers. In a decision, U. S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer of the District put her ruling on hold pending the administration\u2019s certain appeal. Her decision sided with the U. S. House of Representatives, which brought the lawsuit challenging more than $175 billion of spending after a vote by House Republicans in July 2014.",
        "The roiling feud between presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump and reluctant Republican leaders reached a turning point Thursday as the two sides declared their willingness to gloss over substantive policy differences and work together to defeat probable Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in November. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who set off a political earthquake last week by refusing to endorse the real estate mogul, told reporters after a meeting with Trump at the Republican National Committee headquarters that he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by their conversation \u2014 though he still stopped short of an endorsement.",
        "A sailor has died in three out of the last four Navy SEAL training classes, with one drowning days ago during a pool exercise and another committing suicide in April after failing to complete one of the U. S. military\u2019s most demanding training programs. A third sailor, who had been drinking heavily, died in November after his pickup truck rolled off the side of the road, less than three days after learning he had just barely missed the cut to continue training.",
        "For more than a year, the biggest names at the shopping mall have cast a hopeful eye on the declining jobless rate and low gas prices, betting that it was only a matter of time before consumers snapped out of a cycle of tepid spending that has left many retailers grappling with weak sales and declining store traffic. But, with the likes of Gap, Macy\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s reporting this week that they rang up surprisingly dismal sales this spring, retailers \u2014 especially apparel chains and department stores \u2014 are facing a troubling reckoning.",
        "Caption   The Republican candidate continues to dominate the presidential contest.  May 12, 2016 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump waves as he arrives for a meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan at the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington, D. C. Andrew",
        "Donald Trump and Paul Ryan had their meeting on this morning, and while Ryan did not endorse Trump (yet) they issued a joint statement talking about their \u201cmany areas of common ground. \u201d Speaking afterward to reporters, Ryan said, \u201cIt was important that we discussed our differences that we have, but it was also important that we discuss the core principles that tie us together,\u201d and that \u201cGoing forward we\u2019re going to go a little deeper in the policy weeds to make sure we have a better understanding of one another.",
        "It is a daunting task to make a meaningful agreement with someone who has no intention of keeping it. The Obama administration should have understood that when dealing with the Iranians. Whatever is \u201cagreed to\u201d is simply a starting point, the beginning of the Iranians\u2019 demands for more concessions. The mullahs understand that the administration is so invested in the nuclear deal for the sake of a deal that the initial terms can be remarkably favorable to them, and more important, they can essentially rewrite the deal to fit their interests from then on.",
        "In a essay yesterday in the Hollywood Reporter, former MSNBC host and current NBC News reporter Ronan Farrow highlighted the pressure on reporters not to rock the boat. He was writing about his family \u2014 specifically his father, Woody Allen, and the allegations he has long faced that he sexually molested Dylan Farrow, Ronan\u2019s sister, years ago. The media has left behind those allegations, lamented Farrow under the headline \u201cMy Father, Woody Allen, and the Danger of Questions Unasked.",
        "The longtime former butler to presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called for President Obama to be killed, and now the Secret Service said it will conduct an investigation. Liberal magazine Mother Jones reported on Anthony Senecal\u2019s Facebook posts, including one from Wednesday in which he wrote Obama \u201dshould have been taken out by our military and shot as an enemy agent in his first term.\u201d The post was only visible to his Facebook friends, but Senecal confirmed its authenticity to Mother Jones, saying, \u201dI wrote that. I believe that.\u201d \u201dThe U. S.",
        "Mushrooming airport checkpoint lines have passengers fuming, and thousands of them are missing their flights, but the challenge of balancing speed and security was captured in a single comment on Capitol Hill on Thursday. \u201cWhen we criticize you today about having long lines and taking too long to screen people, next week, if there is a [security] breach, we will haul you up here and lambaste you for not being more thorough,\u201d Rep. Stephen F. Lynch ( .) told Peter V. Neffenger, the head of the Transportation Security Administration.",
        "BRASILIA \u2014 The man who assumed control of Latin America\u2019s largest country, Vice President Michel Temer, is a career politician with a reputation as a skilled negotiator and smooth operator. His supporters say he\u2019s just the kind of experienced statesman the country needs in its moment of crisis with President Dilma Rousseff suspended from office Thursday by the senate and facing trial over alleged fiscal wrongdoing. But, this being Brazil, that doesn\u2019t mean Temer is a stodgy technocrat taking the helm.",
        "PARIS \u2014 As protests raged in the capital and across the country, France\u2019s Socialist government survived a vote Thursday after it forced a controversial labor law through Parliament in a attempt to curb unemployment before next year\u2019s presidential election. Although the motion failed, it was a public rebuke of an increasingly unpopular government viewed as politically impotent and increasingly out of touch with the interests of even its own supporters.",
        "After one online gun seller pulled his listing, George Zimmerman has found a new website on which he plans to auction the gun he said he used to kill Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman initially posted the 9mm pistol on GunBroker. com on Wednesday night, more than four years after he shot and killed Martin, an unarmed black teenager. \u201cI am honored and humbled to announce the sale of an American Firearm Icon,\u201d read Zimmerman\u2019s description of the gun, a .",
        "Pope Francis on Thursday told an international conference of nuns that he wants to create a commission to study the possibility of \u201creinstating\u201d female deacons, a dramatic statement highlighting the historic role of women in the church, but one which left unclear what tangible changes Francis is open to making. In a news release, coming a after news of the comments emerged on the Web, the Vatican press office said that the pope made the statement in response to questions about contemporary women\u2019s leadership from nuns at a major Vatican conference.",
        "Way back in 1983, Cyndi Lauper knew that \u201dmoney changes everything.\u201d Social science is finally starting to catch up. The latest findings, from Emily Bianchi of Emory University and Kathleen Vohs of the University of Minnesota, illustrate how having more (or less) money can radically alter the fabric of our relationships with other people, changing how often we socialize \u2014 and with whom. In examining several decades of household survey data, Bianchi and Vohs find that as people make more money, they spend less time socializing with others; they spend more time alone.",
        "Calvin Klein\u2019s underwear ads have always been notoriously risqu\u00e9: Consider Kate Moss\u2019s topless pose in 1992, when she was 17. Or the 1985 ad featuring a woman sandwiched between two strapping young men on a bed. Or the 2010 image with five models piled on a couch in particularly suggestive poses. The brand\u2019s decidedly NSFW spring ad campaign \u2014 wherein models personalize the tagline \u201cI _____ in my calvins\u201d \u2014 is no exception. But one image in particular has caused a bit of a social media uproar (and no, it\u2019s not Kendall Jenner holding a particularly lurid grapefruit half).",
        "PORTLAND, Ore.  \u201d",
        "Let\u2019s stipulate this: Hillary Clinton is going to be the Democratic presidential nominee. But Clinton\u2019s path to that nomination has been far rockier than she or her supporters expected it to be when Bernie Sanders emerged as her main competition. (Don\u2019t believe the Clinton spin that they always knew that the democratic socialist from Vermont was going to pose a major threat to her candidacy.) Some of that rockiness has to do with Sanders, who has emerged as a sort of cause celebre to the liberal left.",
        "Allan Lichtman says he can predict the outcome of any U. S. presidential election. He often does it months or even years ahead of time. Oh, and his predictions have been right in every presidential election since 1984. But Lichtman, a distinguished professor of history at American University, doesn\u2019t use polling, demographics or sophisticated analysis of swing states. He makes his predictions based on 13 statements that he says indicate whether the incumbent party will retain the White House or lose it in a given election.",
        "The voice is instantly familiar; the tone, confident, even cocky; the cadence, distinctly Trumpian. The man on the phone vigorously defending Donald Trump says he\u2019s a media spokesman named John Miller, but then he says, \u201cI\u2019m sort of new here,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m somebody that he knows and I think somebody that he trusts and likes\u201d and even \u201cI\u2019m going to do this a little, and then, yeah, go on with my life.",
        "Thousands of years ago, some of the first Americans knelt beside a pond in what is now Florida. Clutching sharp stone knives, they hacked at the tusk of a slain mastodon, slicing meat away from the long bone. Then, with their work completed, they got up and walked away, leaving behind some tools and the stripped carcass . Centuries passed. Sea levels rose. The ancient site was submerged by layers of sediment, and then by a rising river. Wave after wave of human inhabitants came and went: hunters, farmers, explorers, colonizers, retirees from New York.",
        "The Obama administration unveiled two broad initiatives Friday aimed at combating discrimination against transgender Americans in schools and coverage, affirming the president\u2019s goal of elevating transgender protections to one of the central civil rights issues of his presidency. The moves, both of which had been in the works for years, prompted an immediate backlash from conservatives who disparaged the measures as government overreach. White House officials countered that they reflected one of the administration\u2019s core principles: protecting those targeted for discrimination because of their identity.",
        "BEN GUERDANE, Tunisia \u2014 The families arrived at the cemetery in the night carrying the corpses of their sons and brothers, residents recalled. One by one, the bodies were placed in unmarked graves, outcasts even in death. The dead men had been fighters for the Islamic State. All Tunisians, they had crossed into Libya to join the terrorist group\u2019s affiliate there. In March, they returned with other radicalized Tunisians in an attempt to seize Ben Guerdane, a smuggling hub 20 miles from the border.",
        "My alimentary canal got a lot of traffic this week. Inside Edition, People magazine, ABC News, CNN, National Public Radio and broadcasters from Japan, Germany, Spain and Britain, among others, all took interest in me making good on my pledge to eat an entire column of newsprint if Donald Trump won the Republican presidential nomination. The website Stat probed the health risks I might incur and learned that newspaper ink is \u201cless toxic than sodium cyanide. \u201d Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation\u2019s capital. He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: With the battle continuing to rage over Donald Trump\u2019s ongoing suggestion that he may not release his tax returns before the November election, this exchange with ABC News\u2019s George Stephanopoulous, which took place a few moments ago, provides a glimpse into what Trump really thinks about all this: TRUMP: I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible. STEPHANOPOULOS: What is your tax rate? TRUMP: It\u2019s none of your business. You\u2019ll see it when I release. But I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible.",
        "Sheldon G. Adelson is chairman and chief executive of Las Vegas Sands Corp. At the outset of the 2016 election, the GOP primary field was nearly as large as that of last weekend\u2019s Kentucky Derby. In total, 17 Republican hopefuls campaigned to win the party\u2019s nomination for president. Caption And they\u2019ll tell you why. Jeb Bush On May 6, posted on Facebook, \u201dDonald Trump has not demonstrated that temperament or strength of character. He has not displayed a respect for the Constitution. And, he is not a consistent conservative.",
        "Political journalists have attempted for nearly a year to find genuine policy convictions in presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. They\u2019ve failed. On matters relating to the economy, immigration and beyond, Trump has shifted positions or pushed ideas that defy common sense. \u201cYou have to be flexible,\u201d said Trump at a March 3 Fox News debate. Absent any coherent governing approach, Trump appears propelled by the prospect of spending his days in media interviews. Because that\u2019s pretty much what he has done since the start of his campaign in June 2015.",
        "Save us all the faux drama. We already know how this courtship is going to end: House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) will decide that Donald Trump isn\u2019t such an ogre after all, and they\u2019ll live unhappily ever after. Ryan will be unhappy, at least. Trump has stolen his party, and there\u2019s nothing Ryan can do in the short term to get it back.
