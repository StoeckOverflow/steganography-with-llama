        "BESIDES HIS usual brazenness, something unsettling lurks behind Donald Trump\u2019s latest statement that \u2014 unlike every other nominee in modern times \u2014 he will not make public his tax returns before the November election. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to learn from them,\u201d he told the Associated Press. Earlier, he claimed he could not release his returns because he was being audited. Then he said on Twitter they would be released \u201cwhen audit is complete, not after election!\u201d To voters considering his fitness to be president, Mr.",
        "Venezuela, where clashes erupted this week between security forces and demonstrators protesting food shortages, power blackouts and political gridlock, may be headed toward an popular uprising that could lead to the overthrow of its government this year, senior U. S. intelligence officials said. \u201cYou can hear the ice cracking,\u201d an intelligence official said. \u201cYou know there\u2019s a crisis coming. \u201d Disaster is pending in Venezuela at the same time the Obama administration believes that it has vastly improved U. S.",
        "If there\u2019s any animal that can\u2019t seem to catch a break, it\u2019s the honeybee. Thanks to what scientists believe is a combination of disease, parasites, pesticides and other environmental stressors, honeybee colonies have experienced significant losses over the past decade or so \u2014 a phenomenon that\u2019s troubling to say the least, given the insect\u2019s immense importance when it comes to pollinating food crops and other plants. But despite recent efforts to increase protections for the honeybee, new surveys suggest that the insect is still suffering \u2014 perhaps now more than ever.",
        "Flush with cash in overseas accounts, Apple announced Thursday that it had invested $1 billion in China\u2019s most dominant company, giving the consumer electronics giant a stronger connection to a country that is critical to its future success. The beneficiary of Apple\u2019s decision \u2014 a Beijing company called Didi Chuxing \u2014 is a major rival of Uber in China. Although the deal ranks as one of Apple\u2019s biggest investments, the stake is basically pocket change to the tech giant. As of its last quarterly earnings, Apple had a staggering $233 billion in cash and securities, mostly parked overseas.",
        "Facing the unpredictable candidacy of Republican Donald Trump, Democratic Hillary Clinton is preparing to dispatch resources to industrial states that have been safely Democratic for a generation. Clinton\u2019s plans include an early, aggressive attempt to defend Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan \u2014 reflecting a growing recognition inside her campaign of the threat that Trump\u2019s unconventional bid for president may pose in unexpected places, particularly in economically struggling states that have been hit hard by global agreements.",
        "Wait, is the White House inviting the leaders of five Nordic nations to a state dinner \u2014 that most formal of diplomatic functions, where tuxedos and ice sculptures are the norm \u2014 and asking the presidents, prime ministers and assembled guests to sit on IKEA chairs? The White House on Thursday previewed the decor and menu for Friday evening\u2019s affair, and several reporters couldn\u2019t help but notice that the sculptural white seating displayed under the chandeliers looked like it could have been a bargain buy from the Swedish superstore\u2019s aisles. Not IKEA, we\u2019re assured.",
        "McDonald s has ended a controversial practice of\u00c2 giving nutrition advice to students in schools, pulling back on a program that critics said was a subtle\u00c2 form of marketing that could imperil\u00c2 kids health and understanding of nutrition. The company has stopped sending\u00c2 John Cisna, \u00c2 a teacher from Iowa who came to fame after claiming\u00c2 to have lost almost 60 pounds eating only McDonald s, into schools to talk with children. It also stopped supplying related materials, including a video documentary\u00c2 that was shown to kids about how Cisna lost his weight.",
        "American politics always has surprises, but things have been especially unpredictable since President Obama took office. First, few observers were prepared for the tea party movement, which ousted several veteran GOP lawmakers, replaced them with more radically conservative newcomers, and helped the Republican Party win control of the House of Representatives in 2010. \u201dThat left a lot of analysts wondering: What was this latent force that drove the emergence of this movement?\u201d said Robb Willer, a sociologist at Stanford University. Then, of course, there was Donald Trump.",
        "Robert and Patricia Cogdell helped raise\u00c2 Justin Staton. They were the teen s\u00c2 legal guardians, a role they took on even after learning that Staton wasn t their biological grandson, according to the\u00c2 Arkansas . But in 2015, the Cogdells were fatally shot, their bodies found near their\u00c2 Arkansas home, and Staton, at the age of 14, \u00c2 was among those charged in their killings. The Associated Press reported\u00c2 that\u00c2 the plot was a scheme, ? concocted with other teens during a stint in juvenile jail.",
        "Carole and Serge, 1997 and 2014. (Barbara Patrick Frey) More than 80 million photos are posted every day on Instagram. But what if we ran in the opposite direction? What if you could only be photographed four times \u2014 in your entire life? Barbara Davatz\u2019s photography book, \u201cAs Time Goes By\u201d (Edition Patrick Frey, 2016) is a rumination on this question. When she started the project in 1982, she could not have predicted that the collective imagery of the world would explode in a mushroom cloud of microcommunication, exaggerating the effect of her series.",
        "A band of exasperated Republicans \u2014 including 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, a handful of veteran consultants and members of the conservative intelligentsia \u2014 is actively plotting to draft an independent presidential candidate who could keep Donald Trump from the White House. These GOP figures are commissioning private polling, lining up major funding sources and courting potential contenders, according to interviews with more than a dozen Republicans involved in the discussions. The effort has been sporadic all spring but has intensified significantly in the 10 days since Trump effectively locked up the Republican nomination.",
        "Every preliminary forecast this spring paints a bleak picture for Donald Trump in his effort to win the presidency against Hillary Clinton. The consensus is that there is only a very narrow path to victory, and that will probably shape the opening phase of the campaign. (One Democratic strategist, who knows as much as anyone about the demographics and voting histories of the battleground states, recently speculated on a basis about the matchup between Clinton and Trump. His bottom line: There\u2019s a high likelihood that Clinton at least matches the 332 electoral votes President Obama won in 2012.",
        "A Navy SEAL instructor has been temporarily removed from his training duties following the death of a sailor in a swimming pool, a service spokesman said Saturday. The instructor was removed this week following the May 6 death of Seaman James Derek Lovelace, 21, of Crestview, Fla. said Navy Cmdr. Jason Salata, a spokesman for Naval Special Warfare Command. The incident occurred during the famously grueling Basic Underwater ( ) course at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado in California.",
        "DURHAM, N. C. \u2014 In this state where the modern bathroom wars began, some church and civil rights leaders have begun to spread the word that there\u2019s plenty else to worry about in the controversial new law known formally as the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act. The law not only reverses a Charlotte ordinance that had extended some rights to gay and transgender people. It also prevents city and county governments from setting a standard for private employers and limits how people can sue for discrimination in state court.",
        "THE FRACTURED REPUBLIC: Renewing America\u2019s Social Contract in the Age of Individualism By Yuval Levin Basic Books. 262 pp. $27. 50. It\u2019s almost funny reading that autopsy now. In early 2013, the Republican National Committee ruminated on the party\u2019s latest presidential election defeat and came up with a report \u2014 officially called the Growth & Opportunity Project, although those in the know dubbed it the Republican \u201cautopsy\u201d \u2014 concluding, among other things, that the GOP had to find ways to attract young people, women and ethnic minorities, especially Hispanic voters.",
        "Sigmund Freud didn\u2019t think much of American public restrooms. During his 1909 visit to the United States, he grumbled that they lacked the refinement of European conveniences \u2014 when he could find one at all. Writing to a German friend years later, Freud\u2019s lasting bitterness was obvious: \u201cIs it not sad that we are materially dependent on these savages?\u201d It\u2019s not surprising that a latrine could provoke such strong feelings: We\u2019re seeing a version of these tensions play out today.",
        "Laura Nor\u00e9n is of \u201cToilet: Public Restrooms and the Politics of Sharing . \u201d The public restroom, with its demand that we do something private near colleagues or strangers, provokes all sorts of fears: fear of germs, fear of bodily functions, fear of others thinking we are gross, fear of finding ourselves to be gross, fear of not fitting in and, perhaps the most politically challenging, fear of the other. But all these can be reduced through better design. Here\u2019s one vision of the public bathroom of the future. 1.",
        "Over the past few years, transgender issues have moved into the spotlight in a big way. Caitlin Jenner came out on TV. Laverne Cox was featured on the cover of Time. The White House appointed its first openly trans employee. These cultural changes, though, have led to an ugly backlash. States including North Carolina and Kansas have passed or are considering legislation that limits the rights of transgender people. And the political debates around these issues have perpetuated many myths. 1. Transgender people pose a threat in public bathrooms.",
        "Six months before Bill Clinton was elected president for the first time, \u201cThe Real World\u201d debuted on MTV, signaling the beginning of the network\u2019s retreat from music videos and its embrace of reality programming. (To be more specific, the series debuted on May 21, 1992, the same day Clinton made a campaign speech that addressed the debate over family values and noted \u201cTV\u2019s crass commercialism and glorification of selfishness and violence.",
        "From a campaign season already close to blasting beyond parody comes another twist, courtesy of the nation\u2019s biggest brewer: Anheuser announced Tuesday that it would rebrand its bottles and cans of Budweiser as \u201cAmerica\u201d through the November election. \u201cWe thought nothing was more iconic than Budweiser and nothing was more iconic than America,\u201d the creative director behind the rebranding told Fast Co Design, which broke the news. Yes, it\u2019s hard to argue with the iconic nature of Bud, the country\u2019s brand and one of the top sellers on Earth. Harder still to argue with the stature of the U.",
        "ISTANBUL \u2014 They were used to stalk Russian helicopters in Afghanistan, and the United States has worked hard to keep them out of chaotic Syria. But now Kurdish guerrillas battling Turkey\u2019s security forces may now have missiles \u2014 an acquisition analysts say will seriously challenge Turkish air power and potentially intensify fighting in the region.",
        "CITY | This is the first installment in a series that will examine issues related to repeat violent offenders in the District of Columbia. The woman was sitting on her sofa, working on her laptop, when she saw him. A young man, 6 feet 5 inches tall, wearing fuzzy knit gloves and gray denim pants.

        "LAREDO, Texas \u2014 A charter bus headed to a casino crashed in far South Texas on Saturday, killing eight people and injuring about 40 in a rollover, officials said.

        "HUNTINGTON, Ind. \u2014 Chris Setser worked a graveyard shift while his children slept, cleaned the house while they were at school and then went outside to wait for the bus bringing them home.

        "It all began with what seemed like an innocent interview with Le Soleil, a newspaper. Sophie the wife of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, mused that she was overwhelmed by all the requests for her to participate in public events since becoming Canada\u2019s \u201cfirst lady\u201d. \u201cI\u2019d love to be everywhere but I can\u2019t,\u201d she pleaded, after appearing at an event in Quebec for a nonprofit that encourages teenage girls to be physically fit. \u201cI have three children and a husband who is prime minister. I need help. I need a team to help me serve the people.",
        "Rep. Peter T. King ( . Y.) on Saturday defended his use of a derogatory term toward Japanese in a appearance, saying that he was trying to critique the \u201cuninformed\u201d views that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump espouses.",
        "PRESTONSBURG, Ky. \u2014 The booing was nearly as loud as the cheering when Bill Clinton stepped to the microphone in this remote mountain hamlet deep in the depressed heart of coal country. In the audience at the local elementary school Thursday night was a sizable contingent of coal miners and their families, many wearing helmets and declaring their support for Donald Trump. \u201cI\u2019m not like a lot of people. It doesn\u2019t bother me to have protesters at rallies,\u201d the former president began.",
        "Near the end of his Southwest Airlines flight from Chicago to Albuquerque in December, Gill Parker Payne decided he had to take action. Seated a few rows in front of him was a woman he had never met before. She was wearing a religious headscarf, known as a hijab, which Payne recognized as a Muslim practice. He stood up, walked down the aisle and stopped next to her seat. Looking down at the woman, Payne instructed her to remove the covering. \u201cTake it off!

        "One of the biggest complaints about online dating apps like Tinder is that the people on there are only looking for one thing: sex. Which means that the messages those people send get explicit real fast. One woman in Los Angeles, filmmaker Jessie Kahnweiler, got fed up with that. She invited her sexting Tinder matches to come over. They probably thought they were walking into sex, but instead Kahnweiler wanted to talk \u2026 about their Tinder messaging. Kahnweiler comes across as frustrated and exhausted with online dating, but she doesn\u2019t react angrily to these men."
