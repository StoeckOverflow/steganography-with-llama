        "Everything we know about doing laundry we learned in childhood. \u201cMost people will cook the way their mothers cooked. We learn laundry basics the same way \u2014 from our parents,\u201d says Jenifir Provateare, who has been developing products for the laundry industry for 20 years. But it might be time to dump some of mom or dad\u2019s outdated laundry habits. \u201cTechnology has come a long way since our mothers started doing laundry,\u201d says Provateare, a product development manager at Nehemiah Manufacturing, a consumer goods company.",
        "\u201cLOOK. AT. THE. DEER!\u201d I say this to my sons, 11 and 14, as we do our normal weeknight swing down the driveway, home from what feels like their 10th basketball practice of the week. But my boys are buried in their iPhones, watching for their friends\u2019 on one of whatever social media apps of the moment. Amazing things are going on around them \u2014 I mean, I am floored, every time, by seeing the deer just calmly hanging out a few feet away, staring right at me, not even running away from our car.",
        "Hillary Clinton\u2019s declining personal image, ongoing battle to break free of the challenge from Sen. Bernie Sanders and struggle to adapt to an mood among voters this year have become caution signs for her campaign and the focus of new efforts to fortify her position as she prepares for a bruising general election. More than a dozen Clinton allies identified weaknesses in her candidacy that may erode her prospects of defeating Donald Trump, including poor showings with young women, untrustworthiness, unlikability and a lackluster style on the stump.",
        "PISCATAWAY, N. J. \u2014 President Obama delivered a commencement address at Rutgers University on Sunday that steered clear of the typical graduation advice and sounded a lot like a tough, aggressive takedown of the Republican presidential . The president, who spoke before a crowd of more than 50, 000 in the school\u2019s football stadium here, called on the graduates to reject politicians who hark back to better days. The address was filled with obvious jabs at presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, whom the president didn\u2019t name but who was a foil for the speech\u2019s most cutting applause lines.",
        "Months before Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said the Pentagon would take steps toward allowing transgender people to serve openly in the military, Army Staff Sgt. Patricia King last year became what she believes is the first openly transgender member of the infantry. While official Pentagon policy still forbids openly transgender personnel, her commanders have been supportive, she said. King even purchased a female dress Army service uniform, anticipating that she would be able to wear it soon.",
        "Caption   The rise of China\u2019s middle class has coincided with a boom in Maine\u2019s lobster population, resulting in a voracious new market for the crustacean.   April 29, 2016 Lobsterman Bruce Fernald, center, climbs into a rowboat on Little Cranberry Island in Islesford, Maine, as Kevin Wilson watches. The two were taking the boat to Fernald\u2019s lobster boat to prepare for a day of catching lobsters.  Matt   Washington Post",
        "Joe Scholten\u2019s sister had already beaten breast cancer and was battling ovarian cancer when she tested positive for a genetic mutation linked to both. He responded by doing something unusual: He got tested, too. That\u2019s how the District resident discovered that he also carried the defective BRCA gene. He quickly told his brothers, other relatives and, hardest of all, his daughter. \u201cGetting tested was a \u201d he said, wondering what steps his sister would have taken if she\u2019d learned early on about her own genetic risk. She was 54 when the ovarian cancer killed her.",
        "John King is U. S. education secretary. One of my top priorities as education secretary is to help our public schools serve the needs of our increasingly diverse students so that they have the opportunity to pursue the American dream and use their talents to help our nation tackle some of its most difficult problems. To achieve this goal, we need a teaching force that is as diverse as our students. More and more research shows that diversity isn\u2019t just a nicety \u2014 it\u2019s a real contributor to better outcomes in our schools, workplaces and communities.",
        "Blaming President Obama for the rise of Donald Trump is popular among Republican leaders. They don\u2019t want to take responsibility for the choices made by their own voters or their complicity in tolerating and even encouraging the extremism Trump represents. They also don\u2019t want to face the fact that many Trump ballots were aimed at them. It should be said that many conservatives are resisting the temptation by trying to come to terms with what has happened to their cause.",
        "Monday is the 100th anniversary of something called the agreement, an occasion that has touched off a small frenzy of Washington conferences and journal articles \u2014 not to mention Islamic State manifestos. Mark Sykes and Fran\u00e7ois Georges Picot were diplomats from Britain and France, respectively, who agreed on a secret plan to partition the collapsing Ottoman Empire. The result, after a few more years of imperialist machinations, was the creation of Iraq, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon \u2014 the heart of what is now the bloody chaos of the modern Middle East.",
        "It\u2019s time to cut the GDP some slack. Overhauling the GDP \u2014 as some critics would \u2014 threatens to politicize one of our most useful economic indicators. It could be twisted to advance or retard political agendas. This is a bad idea. First, some background. \u201cGDP\u201d stands for \u201cgross domestic product,\u201d and it\u2019s our standard measure of economic growth. When we hear that the economy grew 2. 4 percent in 2015, it really means that GDP grew 2. 4 percent.",
        "THIS COUNTRY\u2019S national parks, monuments and historic sites are, as anyone who has visited them will attest, treasures that must be fiercely protected. Any talk of corporate and other private sponsorships is bound to raise concerns. No one wants to see the Grand Canyon, the Statue of Liberty or El Capitan besmirched with company logos. But such befouling is not, in fact, being proposed. There is no reason the park system shouldn\u2019t adopt fundraising practices that are commonly used in the nonprofit world \u2014 particularly because, given inadequate congressional support, the alternative is deterioration of these precious places.",
        "BEFORE THE 2014 Olympic Games opened in Sochi, President Vladimir Putin of Russia declared, \u201cI would like the participants, fans, journalists and all those who watch the Games on television to see a new Russia, see its face and possibilities, take a fresh and unbiased look at the country. \u201d The comment was meant to suggest rising pride in Russia after so many years of uncertainty and tumult. Now it is clear that Mr. Putin and his cronies have themselves sullied, in yet one more way, the new Russia they wanted to portray in a better light.",
        "In the rapid expansion of states with laws and the backlash of litigation that always follows, there is one constant from proponents: that the Supreme Court already has declared them constitutional. The court ruled in 2008 that Indiana\u2019s requirement for a photo ID was legal, with none other than liberal justice John Paul Stevens writing what was described as the \u201clead opinion\u201d in a fractured ruling. [Supreme Court upholds Indiana law requiring photo IDs] But in the years since, Stevens \u2014 who retired from the court in 2010 \u2014 has never seemed comfortable with his role in the case.",
        "SUBIC BAY, Philippines \u2014 There\u2019s a taunt that hangs over this former U. S. naval base, looming over kids who look a little different, shadowing single moms: \u201cLeft by the ship. \u201d The term is used to shame the offspring of U. S. servicemen and local women, to tell them that they don\u2019t belong here. That they were left behind. Nearly 25 years ago, Philippine lawmakers expelled the U. S. warships that had docked here for almost a century, vowing to \u201cunchain\u201d the country from its colonial past, promising a fresh start. The American flag was lowered.",
        "The battle lines are drawn between North Carolina and the federal government over the state\u2019s controversial bathroom law. Everyone\u2019s suing everyone, basically. But there\u2019s one defector: North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper, a Democrat who happens to be running for governor, has said he won\u2019t defend the state against the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit because he thinks the new law is discriminatory and \u201da national embarrassment.\u201d And there may not be much anyone can do to shake Cooper from that decision. His opponent, Gov.",
        "JERUSALEM \u2014 French officials said Sunday that they will continue to press ahead with plans to host a multilateral Middle East peace conference later this year, despite hearing, in blunt language, that Israel doesn\u2019t really like the idea. French Foreign Minister Ayrault met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday to promote what diplomats are calling the \u201cFrench Initiative,\u201d a still evolving and admittedly vague diplomatic project that seeks to bring global attention to the conflict and find consensus among the international community on how to move forward with a solution.",
        "This time of year, it\u2019s common for commencement speakers to share with new graduates what they\u2019ve learned in life. On Saturday, while addressing graduating students at the University of California at Berkeley, Sheryl Sandberg flipped the script and instead offered a poignant and fiercely candid speech about what she has learned in death. It was the Facebook chief operating officer\u2019s first public comments about the death last year of her husband, David Goldberg \u2014 a Silicon Valley fixture and the chief executive of SurveyMonkey \u2014 who died unexpectedly while the couple was vacationing in Mexico.",
        "The head of the Republican National Committee denounced efforts to draft an independent candidate to run against Donald Trump as a \u201dsuicide mission\u201d that could \u201dwreck\u201d the United States for generations. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus did not mince words as he urged party figures laying the groundwork for a bid to suspend their operation.",
        "Saturday\u2019s raucous state Democratic convention in Nevada encapsulated a lot of the themes of the party\u2019s 2016 election in a relatively short period: complex delegate math, inscrutable processes, allegations of deceit, fury \u2014 and a result that doesn\u2019t do much of anything to shift the race\u2019s eventual outcome. Nevada\u2019s process for sending delegates to the national convention in Philadelphia is among the most complex. When the state caucused in late February, the fourth state on the calendar for the Democratic Party, the results of that process favored Hillary Clinton.",
        "John Miller here. Damn glad to meet ya! Have you heard about that super handsome, way cool guy named Donald Trump? Man, he is the best! We learned this week that \u201dJohn Miller,\u201d an alleged spokesman for Trump back in the 1980s, was very, very close to the real estate mogul. So close in fact that he was the real estate mogul, making calls to reporters under an assumed name to boost Trump\u2019s status.",
        "EILAT, Israel \u2014 This is what a little peace looks like in the Middle East. A room cleaner named Ahmad. A dishwasher named Mohammad. And a man with a vacuum in the lobby of an Israeli beach hotel. Israel and Jordan signed their peace treaty in 1994 \u2014 that is a generation ago \u2014 but it has often been a cold peace, without real people moving back and forth, without workers, wages or bosses. Now Jordan and Israel have launched a pilot project that is so small and simultaneously so ambitious that it tells the story.",
        "A Supreme Court on Monday sent back to the lower courts several challenges to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement, saying there was a possible compromise between religious objectors and the Obama administration. The unsigned and unanimous decision was unusual \u2014 and largely a punt by a court equally divided along ideological lines after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February. [Reality of a split court: A chance of deadlock and a search for compromises] Both sides in the lawsuits had made concessions since the case was argued in March, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.",
        "Rowanne Brewer Lane, star of the lead anecdote in the New York Times\u2019s Sunday story about Donald Trump\u2019s private interactions with women, spent Monday morning ripping the newspaper for allegedly misquoting her. There is little evidence to support the charge; Brewer Lane\u2019s complaints, upon close inspection, don\u2019t amount to a credible factual challenge. But the former model, whose initial meeting with Trump is described by the Times as a \u201ddebasing encounter,\u201d doesn\u2019t fit neatly into a tale of Trumpian chauvinism, either.",
        "At the heart of the ancient Silk Road, on the edge of the Gobi Desert, lies a place of pilgrimage: hundreds of caves hewn from a sandstone cliff containing some of the most exquisite Buddhist frescoes and figures in the world. Abandoned for centuries, the Mogao Grottoes somehow survived everything that nature and man could throw at them, including earthquakes, floods and sandstorms. Marauding Muslim rebels, plundering European explorers and White Russian soldiers all left their mark. Rampaging Red Guards were turned away at the height of China\u2019s Cultural Revolution.",
        "Apple\u2019s unprecedented decision to throw $1 billion into a Chinese firm last week may seem like a . Why cars? And why not invest that money here in the United States? But this move was no accident. Not only is it a sign of Apple\u2019s growing interest in transportation \u2014 a rapidly changing industry, thanks to groundbreaking technologies such as automation \u2014 but it is also a bet on a country that wants to zip past the United States in the development of the cars of the future.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: Over the weekend, we learned something about Donald Trump\u2019s private treatment of women: He has a long history of \u201cunwelcome romantic advances,\u201d \u201cunending commentary on the female form,\u201d and \u201cunsettling workplace conduct. \u201d Given that Trump already enjoys stratospheric unfavorability ratings among women, it is probably cause for concern among Republicans that much of this information will likely be seen as new by many voters. But Trump remains undaunted about the female vote.",
        "In their support of a bully with few, if any, redeeming features, Donald Trump\u2019s minions in GOP officialdom are themselves becoming obnoxious bullies. Trump has that effect on people. A candidate, a necessity only because the nominee (who won a plurality of the popular vote) lacks affinity for conservatism (not to mention a mature temperament and grasp of issues) has not yet emerged.",
        "Most mornings, I awake to the sound of my son talking to himself in his crib. I enter his room to fetch him, stepping around the books he scattered across the carpet the night before. On the wall hang prints of a fox, a bear, an owl. I decorated this nursery \u2014 for a baby girl \u2014 three years before I had Henry. The only sign of her is a box of tiny ruffled clothes in the closet. Everything had gone well during my pregnancy with my second daughter until the final few weeks.",
        "The rise of Donald Trump in the Republican primaries brought with it quite a few surprises for political pundits. The support the real estate mogul and reality TV star has drawn from white evangelical voters seems to have particularly flummoxed the experts. On the face of it, the affinity seems improbable."
