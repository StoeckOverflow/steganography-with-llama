        "Another commencement, another opportunity for President Obama to urge the nation\u2019s graduates to participate fully in the political process. He cannot say it often enough, especially during a presidential campaign when two candidates \u2014 one from the left and one from the right \u2014 brazenly use the frustrations of the electorate to peddle quick fixes that will only feed its cynicism. \u201cPassion is vital, but you\u2019ve got to have a strategy,\u201d Obama said May 7 at Howard University. \u201cAnd your plan better include voting \u2014 not just some of the time, but all the time.",
        "Note: I\u2019m reviewing \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d from the perspective of someone who has read all of George R. R. Martin\u2019s novels, while my colleague David Malitz, who hasn\u2019t read the books, will be writing straight recaps. His of episode 4, \u201cBook of the Stranger\u201d will appear at The Post\u2019s Style Blog. This post discusses the events of the May 15 episode of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d \u201cBook of the Stranger,\u201d in detail. You can find my recaps of every prior episode of the show here.

        "NEW YORK \u2014 To reach the Ivy League after growing up poor seems like hitting the jackpot. Students get a education from schools that promise to meet full financial needs without making them take out loans. But the reality of a full ride isn\u2019t always what they had dreamed it would be. Here at Columbia University, money pressures lead many to cut corners on textbook purchases and skip city excursions routine for affluent classmates. Some borrow thousands of dollars a year to pay bills. Some feel obliged to send money home occasionally to help their families.",
        "The horrific Amtrak wreck that killed eight people and injured 159 in Philadelphia last year could have been prevented if hardware installed on the train had been switched on, according to investigators. The engineer also might have been distracted by radio traffic about rock throwing involving a SEPTA commuter train, although he told investigators last year that he was not overly worried by the incident. Those factors are among those expected to be discussed when the National Transportation Safety Board meets Tuesday to announce the results of its investigation into the Amtrak wreck.",
        "As you probably know, Facebook has been under fire for the way it edits its Trending Topics. Gizmodo reported earlier this month that trending news editors at the social network had purposefully suppressed news from a conservative political viewpoint. Facebook confirmed that chief executive Mark Zuckerberg is going to meet with top conservatives in California \u2014 including Glenn Beck and Arthur Brooks \u2014 in response to the claims, which Facebook has denied.",
        "Earth has been dealt a hot hand, one that it cannot seem to break. At least, not yet. The planet\u2019s torrid streak of months ballooned to seven in April, NASA data released over the weekend reveals. The average temperature of the planet was 2. 0 degrees Fahrenheit (1. 11 degrees Celsius) above the average in April, shattering the old record from 2010 by 0. 4 degrees (0. 24 degrees Celsius). NASA data now indicates Earth has set record highs in every month since October 2015 and, in each instance, by a substantial margin.",
        "During the 1980s, Donald Trump was known to return reporters\u2019 phone calls posing as a fictional spokesman for the Trump organization. The name Trump assumed varied slightly \u2014 \u201dJohn Miller,\u201d John Barron,\u201d and \u201dJohn Baron\u201d \u2014 but the goal didn\u2019t: Tout Trump as a brilliant playboy. The Post got hold of one conversation between \u201dMiller\u201d and a reporter named Sue Carswell from 1991. The transcript is below, and it is amazing. Using Genius, I annotated it. You can too!

        "Leading Republicans are increasingly anxious that presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump is lagging far behind Democratic Hillary Clinton when it comes to having an organized network of allies, triggering a chaotic scramble to set up a clear super PAC structure. Because Trump condemned such entities throughout the primary contest, there is no dominant group ready to channel the resources of the billionaires lining up to back him, including casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who has signaled plans to inject tens of millions into the race.",
        "We don\u2019t know all that much about who Donald Trump is going to pick \u2014 or even consider \u2014 as his vice presidential running mate. In fact, the most insight we have on Trump\u2019s VP thinking is who he\u2019s not going to pick. Trump tweeted \u2014 of course \u2014 this out Sunday afternoon: The @washingtonpost report on potential VP candidates is wrong. Marco Rubio and most others mentioned are NOT under consideration. \u2014 Donald J.",
        "Jane Little, who debuted as a bassist in Atlanta on Feb. 4, 1945, at age 16 and who never stopped playing, died during a performance of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra on Sunday. She was said to be the longest tenured orchestra musician in the world. She was 87. \u201cWe can say that Jane was fortunate to do what she loved until the very end of her storied life and career,\u201d the symphony said in a Facebook post.",
        "The weather at Yellowstone National Park on May 9 was fairly temperate: The low was 39 degrees Fahrenheit; the high was 50. Nevertheless, when two tourists saw a baby bison, they decided it looked cold and needed to be rescued. So they loaded it in the trunk of their car and drove it to a ranger station. [Seriously, people, stay away from the bison] Over the weekend, their action was widely mocked online as evidence of extreme anthropomorphism, not to mention stupidity. On Monday, the park revealed that it was also deadly \u2014 for the bison.",
        "On Dec. 7, 1988, northern Armenia was devastated by a near 7. 0 magnitude earthquake; 25, 000 were killed, thousands more injured, and hundreds of thousands left homeless in what was then a Soviet republic. The collapse of the Soviet Union greatly hindered the reconstruction of the affected cities, including Gyumri, Armenia\u2019s second largest city. Many families are still waiting for aid, but are ineligible for government housing if they are not considered direct victims of the quake. Photographer Yulia Grigoryants stumbled upon some of these families inhabiting one of the abandoned apartment buildings in Gyumri.",
        "Democratic Hillary Clinton declared victory in the Kentucky primary on Tuesday, potentially disrupting a string of expected primary losses this month that had threatened to weaken her even as she turned her focus to her likely matchup against Republican Donald Trump in the general election. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, meanwhile, was declared the winner of Oregon\u2019s Democratic primary. The outcomes will do little to change the dynamics in the race. In Kentucky, Sanders had hoped to continue a state winning streak that began in Indiana and West Virginia this month. With 99.",
        "On the 24th floor of Trump Tower, in an office two floors below Donald Trump, Felix Sater was trying to revive his career. The businessman had already done a stint in prison for stabbing a man in the face with the stem of a margarita glass, and he was now awaiting sentencing for his role in a stock fraud scheme \u2014 all the while serving as a government informant on the mob and mysterious matters of national security. But Sater and his business partners had an idea: They would build Trump towers in U. S.",
        "Poor, black and Hispanic children are becoming increasingly isolated from their white, affluent peers in the nation\u2019s public schools, according to new federal data showing that the number of schools serving primarily black and brown students more than doubled between 2001 and 2014. The data was released by the Government Accountability Office on Tuesday, 62 years to the day after the Supreme Court decided that segregated schools are \u201cinherently unequal\u201d and therefore unconstitutional. That landmark decision in Brown v.",
        "The past few weeks have offered Americans a chilling glimpse of three faces of Donald Trump: the stonewaller, the and the liar. Trump the stonewaller has been on display in his refusal to release his tax returns. \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business,\u201d Trump flatly told ABC News\u2019s George Stephanopoulos when asked about his effective tax rate. Stephanopoulos: \u201cYes or no, do you believe voters have a right to see your tax returns before they make a final decision?\u201d Trump: \u201cI don\u2019t think they do. But I do say this, I will really gladly give them.",
        "You could say that it all depends on how you define \u201clie. \u201d Or, perhaps, that it\u2019s hell to have a public record. Either way, Hillary Clinton\u2019s vast r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of, shall we say, inconsistencies, is the dog that caught the car and won\u2019t let go. A viral video collection of her comments on various subjects through the years is bestirring Republican hearts. To those who\u2019d rather vote for a reality show host than a Clinton, the video merely confirms what they\u2019ve believed all along.",
        "Let\u2019s examine what Bernie Sanders supporters did in his name over the weekend. As the Nevada Democratic convention voted to award a majority of delegates to Hillary Clinton \u2014 an accurate reflection of her victory in the state\u2019s February caucuses \u2014 Sanders backers charged the stage, threw chairs and shouted vulgar epithets at speakers. Security agents had to protect the dais and ultimately clear the room.",
        "There is a strain of reporting on Donald Trump\u2019s strengths and Hillary Clinton\u2019s weaknesses that is becoming rather irritating. The presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s popularity with white voters is seen as a red flag for his Democratic opponent. Meanwhile, her overwhelming support among African American and Latino voters is practically dismissed. Neither Clinton nor Trump will win without a coalition of voters. And right now, the former secretary of state running to succeed the nation\u2019s first black president has the upper hand.",
        "On Oct. 21, 2014, Robin Raphel, a former assistant secretary of state, got an urgent call from her daughter, who said that something had triggered the burglar alarm at home. When Raphel arrived, she found FBI agents searching her files and other personal materials. Raphel frantically telephoned her office at the State Department to ask what was happening; colleagues said they had been instructed not to speak with her. Agents were already riffling her desk at State and putting up yellow tape to warn off workmates. David Ignatius writes a foreign affairs column and contributes to the PostPartisan blog.",
        "VIRGINIA\u2019S VACUUM in public ethics was laid bare two years ago in the matter of former governor Robert F. McDonnell (R) who failed to break a single state law despite his profligacy. The Supreme Court is now deliberating the question of whether his greed and poor judgment met the definition of bribery under federal corruption statutes. In the meantime, officials in Richmond are still wrestling with the concept of what constitutes a freebie \u2014 and, gee, does that really mean we can\u2019t take those tickets to see Washington\u2019s NFL team?",
        "The Obama administration will unveil a new rule Wednesday that would make millions of workers eligible for overtime pay, a move that delivers a victory for labor groups. The regulations, which were last updated more than a decade ago, would let salaried employees earn overtime if they make up to $47, 476 a year, more than double the current threshold of $23, 660 a year. The Labor Department estimates that the rule would boost the pockets of 4. 2 million additional workers.",
        "Dozens of former Olympic athletes could be barred from the upcoming Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, the International Olympic Committee announced Tuesday, after drug testers completed an initial wave of analysis of old samples in the aftermath of a series of reports alleging systemic, cheating by Russia. Testing of 454 urine samples from the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing revealed suspicious samples from 31 athletes from 12 countries, the IOC said.",
        "A federal judge ruled Tuesday that a key provision of the District\u2019s new gun law is probably unconstitutional, ordering D. C. police to stop requiring individuals to show \u201cgood reason\u201d to obtain a permit to carry a firearm on the streets of the nation\u2019s capital. U. S. District Judge Richard J. Leon found that the law violates the \u201ccore right of \u201d granted in the Second Amendment, setting aside arguments from District officials that the regulation is needed to prevent crime and protect the public.",
        "COLUMBIA, S. C. \u2014 The South Carolina Legislature passed a bill Tuesday prohibiting abortion after 19 weeks, becoming the 17th state to pass the restrictive ban. The legislation will now head to Gov. Nikki Haley\u2019s desk. The Republican said in March she will almost certainly sign it, but wants to look at the details once it reaches her. Similar laws are in effect in 12 states. They\u2019ve been blocked by court challenges in three others, and the U. S. Supreme Court has yet to rule on the ban\u2019s constitutionality.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 In the face of a brutal new Democratic advertising assault, Donald Trump said he plans to rehabilitate his battered image in the coming weeks by publicly addressing some of the most controversial episodes of his campaign. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee\u2019s strategy is fueled by a desire to persuade voters that he\u2019s nothing like the monster he believes his political adversaries and the media have portrayed him to be. Trump is taking other steps to recalibrate the impression he leaves on voters.",
        "It\u2019s been two weeks since Donald Trump effectively clinched the Republican presidential nomination. As of today, he has won nearly 11 million votes and 1, 134 delegates. He is the only candidate (of the 17 who began this race) who is still actively running. He has been acknowledged by the chairman of the Republican National Committee as the presumptive nominee. And yet, dissenters remain. First came the story by my colleagues Bob Costa and Phil Rucker detailing the extensive and unsuccessful efforts by party like Mitt Romney to recruit someone \u2014 anyone!",
        "HOPKINSVILLE, Ky. \u2014 Hillary Clinton fired back at a woman who stood during a rally here Monday to disagree with a line in Clinton\u2019s stump speech about Kentucky\u2019s Republican Gov. Matt Bevin. The exchange unfolded as Clinton discussed improvements that had occurred in the state on issues such as education, implementing the Affordable Care Act and lowering the unemployment rate \u2014 all of which she attributed to Bevin\u2019s predecessor, Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear. \u201cYour governor did such a great job and your current governor is trying to undo it all,\u201d Clinton said, referring to Bevin and Beshear.",
        "Comoros, an island nation in the Indian Ocean, is one of the smallest countries in Africa. Excluding the contested island of Mayotte, the Comoros archipelago covers about 640 square miles, roughly half the size of Rhode Island. Fewer than a million people live on the islands, made up of a variety of ethnicities that reflect the nation\u2019s location at a historical crossroads.",
        "William Backer, a major figure in American advertising and a principal creator of one of the most indelible of all commercials, the 1971 TV spot in which a vast and youth chorus sings with guileless enthusiasm, \u201cI\u2019d Like to Buy the World a Coke,\u201d died May 13 at a hospital in Warrenton, Va. He was 89. The Piedmont Environmental Council, a conservation group where Mr. Backer had been president since 2004, announced the death. His wife, Ann Mudge Backer, said the cause was complications from colon cancer surgery."
