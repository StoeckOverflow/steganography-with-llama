The Republican Party\u2019s attempt to treat Donald Trump as a normal political candidate would be laughable were it not so perilous to the republic. If only he would mouth the party\u2019s \u201cconservative\u201d principles, all would be well. But of course the entire Trump phenomenon has nothing to do with policy or ideology. It has nothing to do with the Republican Party, either, except in its historic role as incubator of this singular threat to our democracy.",
        "The success of Bernie Sanders\u2019s insurgency is a marvel and an achievement. His showing is a mark of the anger and frustration felt by so many Americans over the abuses of capitalism that led to the crash of 2008.
