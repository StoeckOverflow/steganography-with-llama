        "Among the abundant ironies of this election cycle, there is this: We are now in the eighth year of the most liberal administration since Lyndon Johnson\u2019s. The primary elections reveal a national mood of anxiety, apprehension and anger, in turn reflecting stagnation at home and failure abroad. of Americans think the country is on the wrong track. Yet after nearly two terms of Barack Obama\u2019s corrosively unsuccessful liberalism, both parties have decisively moved left. Hillary Clinton cannot put away a heretofore marginal, socialist. He has forced her into leftward genuflections on everything from trade to national health care.",
        "Bernie Sanders is playing a dangerous game. If he and his campaign continue their attacks against the Democratic Party, they will succeed in only one thing: electing Donald Trump as president. I say this as someone who shares much of Sanders s political philosophy; I, too, for example, see health care as a basic right. He has run a remarkable and historically significant campaign, pulling the party to the left and pumping it full of new progressive vigor. His crowds are almost as big as Trump s and perhaps even more enthusiastic.",

In the past several years, as it has become easier to spread misinformation and conspiracy theories on the Internet, politically neutral websites have sprung up in response.",
        "THE NATIONAL Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine already examined genetically engineered (GE) crops once, concluding six years ago that the facts do not justify the fears about \u201cFrankenfoods. \u201d Overblown worries nevertheless continue to proliferate, prompting a movement to stigmatize genetically engineered crops by requiring labels on food packaging. Meanwhile, the technology also has advanced: New tools will allow scientists to more precisely cut and paste genetic code. So the National Academies have again tried to sort things out, releasing another authoritative report Tuesday that refutes the counterproductive scaremongering from the side.",
        "PALO ALTO, Calif. Silicon Valley has more than 23, 000 at least according to the networking site AngelList. It certainly feels that way when you\u2019re in Palo Alto. But it turns out that this place is the exception to a worrying trend. It is by now well documented that activity has been slowing down in the United States for about three decades, dropping sharply over the past 10 years.

CBS announced his death, but the cause was not immediately known. The Mr. Safer spent more than 50 years as a CBS News correspondent.

        "Nine in 10 Native Americans say they are not offended by the Washington Redskins name, according to a new Washington Post poll that shows how few ordinary Indians have been persuaded by a national movement to change the football team\u2019s moniker. The survey of 504 people across every state and the District reveals that the minds of Native Americans have remained unchanged since a 2004 poll by the Annenberg Public Policy Center found the same result. Responses to The Post\u2019s questions about the issue were broadly consistent regardless of age, income, education, political party or proximity to reservations.",
        "The phone call arrived unexpectedly, a few minutes before 9 p. m. on May 11. Vanessa Peterson picked up and greeted her best friend, Candace Pickens. A few hours earlier, Pickens had been posting happy Snapchat videos from her son\u2019s birthday celebration at a Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s in Asheville, N. C. where she lived. Now, she sounded distracted and uneasy, leading Peterson to suspect something was amiss. \u201cShe asked if she could spend the night,\u201d Peterson told The Washington Post on Thursday.",
        "LAWRENCE TOWNSHIP, N. J. \u2014 Ever since Gov. Chris Christie dropped out of the Republican presidential race and backed Donald Trump, he has taken quite a beating while helping the man he calls \u201cMr. Trump\u201d try to win the White House. Now, after months of kowtowing to Trump, the roles were reversed \u2014 if only for a few hours. Trump appeared at a fundraiser here Thursday night to help retire the debt Christie still carries from his failed presidential campaign.",
        "Writer and activist Shaun King has a prolific presence on social media and an outspoken passion for Bernie Sanders. King appeared in Sanders\u2019s Spike promotional video that came out shortly before the New York primary, and he has consistently advocated for the senator from Vermont on Twitter for months. On Thursday, he used Twitter to vent about something that frustrated him: Hillary Clinton\u2019s assertion that she leads the Democratic primary by 3 million votes, a figure that he says is inaccurate and overstated. It isn\u2019t. Here were King\u2019s tweets on the subject. (Sound effects in frustrated anguish) Ahhhhh. Sigh.",

It was December 1993, their father was remarrying after a spectacular divorce from their mother, and the children had a public to answer to. The paparazzi had been in their faces for years.

        "VIENNA \u2014 He wants to build a fence on the southern border to keep migrants out. He is vowing to \u201cstop the invasion of Muslims. \u201d And although few took his candidacy seriously at first, he has ridden to the cusp of power. Donald Trump? Nope. Norbert Hofer. Analysts say that Hofer, the in Austria\u2019s presidential election this Sunday, is part of the transatlantic rebranding of populism. By exchanging rabid speeches and slogans for more disarming methods, a new breed of Western politician is making nationalistic rhetoric seem not only palatable but even entertaining.",

Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan Reilly of the Huffington Post were arrested Aug. 13, 2014, by police who were clearing a Ferguson McDonald\u2019s in which the two reporters were working alongside other journalists.

        "For the first 14 and a half years of Gordy\u2019s life, Evan and Dara Baylinson had no reason to think their son could comprehend anything they said: He had never spoken, and he couldn\u2019t really emote. They worried aloud about his future, not filtering what they said, because they didn\u2019t think he understood. But Gordy was absorbing everything. \u201cMy brain, which is much like yours, knows what it wants and how to make that clear,\u201d he wrote in a letter he sent to a police officer. \u201cMy body, which is much like a drunken, almost toddler, resists.",
        "Before 8 a. m. I have often already applied seven products to my face face wash, tinted moisturizer, eyeliner, mascara and more. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019m terribly fussy, or alone. In an effort to appear polished and professional, many American women not all, of course, but many spend a huge amount of time and money on makeup and skincare products. Hugely popular cosmetics companies such as Sephora and Bluemercury feature a slew of products that I don\u2019t even understand \u2014 from Amazonian eyebrow mousse to ambient lighting powder.",

        "A uniformed Secret Service officer shot and critically wounded a man who brandished a gun outside the White House Friday afternoon, authorities said. The U. S. Secret Service said in a statement that the man approached a security gate on E Street Northwest shortly after 3 p. m. carrying a gun. In the statement, the agency said the man refused numerous orders to drop the weapon and was shot. Two law enforcement officials said he was shot once in the chest and rushed to a hospital in critical condition. Authorities said a firearm was recovered.",
        "LOUISVILLE \u2014 Donald Trump \u2014 who just a few years ago praised President Obama\u2019s appeal for stronger gun control after the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn. \u2014 was endorsed and embraced by the National Rifle Association on Friday, completing his rapid transformation into a fierce advocate. Instead of detailing his own positions on gun rights issues at a political forum attended by thousands of NRA members, Trump told the crowd that Democratic Hillary Clinton would \u201cabolish the Second Amendment\u201d and then release violent criminals from prison, not caring that innocent citizens would be unable to protect themselves.",
        "The last time information from Donald Trump\u2019s returns was made public, the bottom line was striking: He had paid the federal government $0 in income taxes. The disclosure, in a 1981 report by New Jersey gambling regulators, revealed that the wealthy Manhattan investor had for at least two years in the late 1970s taken advantage of a provision popular with developers that allowed him to report negative income. Today, as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Trump regularly denounces corporate executives for using loopholes and \u201cfalse deductions to \u201cget away with murder\u201d when it comes to avoiding taxes.",

        "Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin vetoed a controversial bill Friday that would have made it a felony for doctors to perform abortions, saying she felt the bill was too vague and unable to withstand a legal challenge. Fallin\u2019s decision came a day after lawmakers in the state approved the unprecedented bill, well before a deadline for her to sign the measure, veto it or allow it to become law without her signature.",
        "Hillary Clinton is a Democratic candidate for president and a former secretary of state and U. S. senator from New York. Jennifer lives in Loudoun County. She has three young boys. She pays $2, 500 every month for child care. That\u2019s more than her mortgage. This month in Northern Virginia, I met several moms and dads who told me similar stories. In every state in the country, child care for two kids now costs more than the average rent. You read that right \u2014 child care costs more than housing.",
        "Donald Trump speaks before the National Rifle Association\u2019s convention today, where he will enact a charade of cultural affinity for the assembled members, one utterly laughable in its insincerity. Not being there to ask them, I can\u2019t say whether anyone in the hall actually believes that he means what he\u2019ll say to them.",
        "Just how gullible does Donald Trump suppose the American voter is? The billionaire showman has been the presumptive Republican presidential nominee for only a couple of weeks, yet his general election strategy is already becoming clear: hope for a mass nationwide outbreak of memory loss. His top strategist, Paul Manafort, has said that the \u201cpart that he\u2019s been playing is now evolving. \u201d But this isn\u2019t evolution \u2014 it\u2019s reincarnation. That call Trump made \u201cfor a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d? Turns out that was \u201cjust a suggestion,\u201d he now says.",
        "With a convergence of inattentive writing and unquenchable zeal, the Republican Party of Texas recently suggested that most Texans are gay. The claim places the state party at the vanguard of the sexual revolution, leaping over Kinsey enthusiasts and their comparatively modest estimate that only 10% of Americans are homosexual. (Kinsey himself made no such claim.) At least that\u2019s the interpretation being placed on the 2016 Texas GOP platform by gleeful Internet grammarians.",
        "Democrats have been congratulating themselves on their good fortune in the Senate races. Donald Trump will sink the Republicans! Look at our fine recruits! There are problems on both fronts. First, so far Trump is running more competitively in states with critical Senate races. For example, he is statistically tied with Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire, where Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R) is running against Gov. Maggie Hassan (D). Moreover, as Trump becomes more erratic and less associated with standard Republican messaging, it becomes harder to make the case that Ayotte or, say, Sen.",
        "CAIRO \u2014 The discovery of human remains, wreckage and passenger belongings from an EgyptAir plane that plunged into the Mediterranean Sea on Thursday added momentum to the quest to unravel the mystery of why Flight 804 from Paris to Cairo suddenly dropped from the sky, probably killing all 66 people aboard. Without the bulk of the fuselage and flight recorder, the tragedy has offered few tangible clues but plenty of speculation that terrorists may have targeted the Airbus A320. On Friday, Egyptian naval ships backed by U. S.",
        "JERUSALEM \u2014 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s attempts to remake his governing coalition have set heads spinning \u2014 dumping his defense minister to possibly bring aboard a polarizing maverick with few friends in Washington. Definitely out: Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, who resigned his post on Friday. On the way to the door, Yaalon blasted Netanyahu, saying he has lost confidence in the prime minister\u2019s and morals. Maybe in: Avigdor Lieberman. He\u2019s a former foreign minister and current leader of an ultranationalist political party built around the 1 million immigrants to Israel.",
        "FALL CITY, WASH. \u2014 It was group discussion time at reSTART, a woodsy rehabilitation center about 30 miles outside Seattle. Four residents sat around the living room and talked about their struggles with addiction, anxiously drumming their fingers on their legs and fidgeting with their shoelaces. One young man described dropping out of college to seek treatment for the crippling problem that brought them all here: compulsive Internet use. It is easy to scoff at the idea of Internet addiction, which is not officially recognized as a disorder in the United States.",
        "Donald Trump isn\u2019t the only rich businessman and political neophyte telling West Virginia voters he can create jobs if he is elected. Jim Justice \u2014 a colorful baron and owner of the famed Greenbrier hotel \u2014 solidly defeated two rivals this month to win the Democratic primary for governor, putting him on a path to likely victory in November, according to polls. Justice, who has never held office, spent lavishly on his campaign, including an party at the Greenbrier featuring ham biscuits and shrimp cocktails."
