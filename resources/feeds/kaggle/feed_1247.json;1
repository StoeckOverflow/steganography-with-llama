        "MEXICO CITY \u2014 The Mexican government has approved the extradition of drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \u201dEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n to the United States, a decision aimed at delivering one of the world\u2019s most notorious criminals to the U. S. justice system to face a vast array of drug trafficking and organized crime charges. Mexico\u2019s Foreign Relations Department announced the move in a statement Friday afternoon, saying that the government has agreed to send Guzm\u00e1n to the United States to face charges in Texas and California for murder, money laundering, weapons possession, distribution of cocaine and other crimes.",
        "Metro fired 20 managers Friday in what the agency\u2019s top executive described as a step toward \u201crestructuring\u201d the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority after months of subway safety problems, service disruptions and financial woes. General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld sent an email to Metro employees announcing the firing of the managers, seven of whom he identified only as senior managers. More than of the fired managers worked in subway operations, Wiedefeld said. The firings were \u201cimmediate, effective today,\u201d Metro spokesman Dan Stessel said Friday.",
        "First lady Michelle Obama on Friday unveiled the overhaul of the nutrition labels you see on every packaged product at the grocery store, and it looks a lot like the old one \u2014 at least superficially. The new label still retains the minimalist look that designers have praised over the years, and it highlights many of the same categories, such as cholesterol and sodium. But this is where it might get confusing: Even though it doesn\u2019t look all that different, some categories are now emphasized more than others, and the way some numbers are calculated has changed.",
        "Alan Young, an Emmy comic actor best remembered for playing Wilbur, the human sidekick and wonky owner of a talking palomino horse in the 1960s television sitcom \u201cMister Ed,\u201d died May 19 at the Motion Picture & Television Home in Woodland Hills, Calif. He was 96. Jaime Larkin, a spokesperson for the home, announced the death but did not disclose a cause. Mr.",
        "BAGHDAD \u2014 Security forces used live ammunition and tear gas to push back protesters who broke into the fortified Green Zone on Friday, in a sharp escalation of unrest that has gripped the Iraqi capital. Iraq\u2019s military imposed a curfew across Baghdad after the protesters breached the secured area, which is home to the parliament and other government buildings.",
        "They\u2019ve physically dodged reporters, they\u2019ve twisted their words beyond the legal definitions of said words, and they\u2019ve . Some congressional Republicans have so creatively avoided taking a firm stand on whether they\u2019ll support, endorse or campaign with presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump that one now even has an evasive maneuver named after her. But the Republicans on this list have good reason to want to avoid being tied to Trump: Democrats are going to drive that connection home with all the nuance of a sledgehammer.",
        "There is a very good and thoughtful essay from Emory University\u2019s Alan Abramowitz and AEI\u2019s Norm Ornstein on Friday morning demanding begging that we pump the brakes a bit on every poll that comes out. It ends with these sage words: \u201dEveryone needs to be better at reading polls \u2014 to first look deeper into the quality and nature of a poll before assessing the results.\u201d Very true, I think to myself, soberly.",
        "Last weekend\u2019s angry Democratic state convention in Nevada brought tensions within the Democratic Party to the surface. A group of angry Bernie Sanders supporters in the room and a handful of aggressive, threatening ones outside of it led to a formal letter of complaint against Sanders\u2019s campaign from the state party. An undercurrent of frustration felt by the Sanders campaign at the behavior of the national party erupted in force, leading to reports that Sanders planned to go to the mattresses against the DNC.",
        "The U. S. military has conducted an air strike against Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansour, the Pentagon said on Saturday. In a statement, Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said that the attack on Mansour took place on Saturday \u201cin a remote area of the border region. \u201d A U. S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive military operation, said that President Obama had authorized the operation, in which several drone aircraft had launched a strike on a vehicle in a remote area near Ahmad Wal, a town in western Pakistan.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 Presidential campaigns are always studies in contrast, but rarely have the differences between the two major party nominees \u2014 and the kind of campaigns they plan to run \u2014 been as stark and as unusual as those between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. His political instincts are as rash as hers are cautious. Her policy proposals are as detailed and numerous as his are broad and few in numbers. Her public appearances are controlled and careful. His are the political equivalent of \u201cThe Truman Show. \u201d She says he is unqualified to be president.",
        "Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders on Saturday announced his support for Tim Canova, the former Capitol Hill staffer challenging Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( .) in the primary for her House seat. \u201dClearly, I favor her opponent,\u201d Sanders told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper in an interview scheduled to run on Sunday\u2019s \u201dState of the Union\u201d broadcast. \u201dHis views are much closer to mine than as to Wasserman Shultz\u2019s.",
        "BALTIMORE \u2014 Four times in his brief racing career, Exaggerator had found himself in a starting gate alongside Nyquist, and four times, his view by the end of the race was that of Nyquist\u2019s rear end. But the fifth time was Saturday, near the end of a gray, cold, day at Pimlico Race Course, and this time, it was Exaggerator surging past his more storied rival and into the winner\u2019s circle, winning the Preakness by lengths and ending Nyquist\u2019s Triple Crown hopes. Breaking from the No.",
        "BALTIMORE \u2014 Two horses in Preakness Day undercard races died at Pimlico Race Course on Saturday, including Homeboykris, a 2010 Kentucky Derby entrant, who suffered an apparent heart attack after winning the first race of the day. Three races later, Prameyda, a filly, broke down on the final turn of a 1 turf race, suffering a broken cannon bone in her left front leg, and was euthanized on the track. Her jockey, Daniel Centeno, was taken to a nearby hospital with what was believed to be a broken collarbone.",
        "If Hillary Clinton is elected president, she won\u2019t be the only Clinton making gender history: Her husband, Bill, will take his place as the first \u201cfirst gentleman. \u201d Lest voters get nervous, Hillary has pledged that Bill wouldn\u2019t be on traditional first lady duty \u2014 he\u2019d be in charge of fixing the economy, not picking out the flowers and china for state dinners. But why shouldn\u2019t he pick the china? If one goal of a Hillary Clinton presidency is to challenge traditional gender roles, then her husband should flout them, too.",
        "Robert McCartney is senior regional correspondent and associate editor at The Washington Post. It\u2019s humbling to admit it, but Dan Snyder wins. A Washington Post poll released Thursday has confirmed that the vast majority of American Indians don\u2019t consider the name of Washington\u2019s professional football team to be offensive. Why should this bother me? After all, I\u2019m a longtime, devoted fan of the burgundy and gold. A season ticket holder for more than a decade.",
        "My tumbled into the classroom, and one child I\u2019d especially been watching for \u2014 I need to protect her privacy, so I\u2019ll call her Janie \u2014 immediately noticed the two charts I\u2019d hung low on the wall. Still wearing her jacket, she let her backpack drop to the floor and raised one finger to touch her name on the math achievement chart. Slowly, she traced the row of dots representing her scores for each state standard on the latest practice test. Red, red, yellow, red, green, red, red.",
        "Terri is the director of care and the SANE program manager at Southwest Health hospital in Platteville, Wis. PLATTEVILLE, WIS. As an nurse in southwest Wisconsin, I sometimes received patients who had been sexually assaulted \u2014 and I was expected to help conduct an exam to collect and preserve DNA evidence, though I didn\u2019t have the appropriate training. I would try to make sense out of the rape kit: a cardboard box packed with numerous envelopes holding a mess of swabs and slides.",
        "On May 11, Washington set a new record for the most consecutive days with measurable rain: 15. Skies have been overcast on all afternoons this month but three. Every day, the forecast is the same: cloudy with a chance of showers. Will it ever stop? Of course it will, one day. But instead of fighting the mist, it might be better to dive in head first. Let this collection of books and activities get you through the gray. And don\u2019t worry \u2014 they can all be enjoyed indoors.",
        "The District of Columbia operates a $13 billion budget, but it can\u2019t technically spend that money without approval from Congress. District residents have been voting for their own mayors and legislators for more than 40 years, but representatives from the hinterlands are still allowed to weigh in on how the city conducts its business, thanks to language in the Home Rule Act of 1973 that treats D. C.\u2019s budget like that of a federal agency.",
        "The world\u2019s most powerful man had just uttered five words that, in an instant, fundamentally altered the debate. \u201cI\u2019d think about changing it,\u201d President Obama said in early October 2013, explaining what he would do about the Washington Redskins\u2019 controversial name if he owned the team. Suddenly, a effort by Native American activists to force the franchise to retire its moniker reignited, commanding national attention for months to come. The movement suffered a blow Thursday when a new Washington Post poll showed that 9 in 10 Native Americans do not find the team\u2019s name offensive.",
        "MIT BADR HALAWA, Egypt \u2014 For decades, the sons of this northern Egyptian village traveled to France to seek their fortunes, forming one of the more unique bonds between Arabs and Europeans. Many were smuggled into France, others entered illegally. Most sent money back to help their families and home town. The link was so strong that the village earned a nickname: Mit Paris. So when the villagers learned about the disappearance of EgyptAir Flight 804, they were collectively thrown into shock: A fifth of the Egyptians on the plane were from Mit Badr Halawa.",
        "NORTHERN SYRIA \u2014 On a secret trip to Syria, the new commander of U. S. forces in the Middle East said Saturday he felt a moral obligation to enter a war zone to check on his troops and make his own assessment of progress in organizing local Arab and Kurd fighters for what has been a slow campaign to push the Islamic State out of Syria. \u201cI have responsibility for this mission, and I have responsibility for the people that we put here,\u201d Army Gen.",
        "In a campaign season that has renewed public anxiety about U. S. job losses to China, one Michigan shoe company stands as a stark example of how the economic dynamics are changing quickly in Asia. Wolverine Worldwide exemplifies a sharp shift among American footwear and garment producers away from China toward an emerging manufacturing hot spot: Vietnam. Over the past three years, the Rockford, Mich. maker of brands such as Keds, Hush Puppies and Saucony has more than doubled its production in the Southeast Asian nation, taking advantage of the lower labor costs there.",
        "Maddison Wentworth had been counting down the days until her school\u2019s field day activities, friends and family said, ready for things such as sack races, softball tosses and fights. \u201cShe was excited about Field Day,\u201d her mother, Leslie Wentworth, told NBC affiliate WVTM. \u201cShe had $10 that burned a hole in her pocket to spend. \u201d But during a game Thursday, the teen slumped to the ground, police told Al. com. School nurses rushed to her side, performing CPR. She was taken to a nearby hospital, where she was pronounced dead.",
        "One night in January, Donald Trump skipped a GOP debate and instead held his own televised fundraiser for veterans. At the end of the night, Trump proclaimed it a huge success: \u201cWe just cracked $6 million, right? Six million. \u201d Now, Trump\u2019s campaign says that number is incorrect. Campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said the fundraiser actually netted about $4. 5 million, or 75 percent of the total that Trump announced. Lewandowski blamed the shortfall on Trump\u2019s own wealthy acquaintances.",
        "A day after Donald Trump told people at the National Rifle Association that Hillary Clinton would strip away their right to bear arms, the Republican seemed to suggest on social media that his opponent, who he thinks totes a hard line on gun control, should disarm her Secret Service team. \u201cCrooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed,\u201d Trump tweeted Saturday morning.",
        "Chairing the Democratic National Committee can\u2019t be all that Debbie Wasserman Schultz had hoped it would. She\u2019s weathered slights and rebukes by the barrel and gets virtually no credit for any electoral gains Democrats have made during her time at the top of the party. And this week was particularly indicative of her tumultuous time as DNC chair \u2014 and why the 2016 election can\u2019t come soon enough for her. It all began last weekend when supporters of Bernie Sanders and backers of Hillary Clinton faced off at the Nevada state party convention.",
        "Google this week announced a new messaging app with strong encryption, meaning that your communications can\u2019t be wiretapped. But there\u2019s a catch: You have to turn on that feature yourself. The tech titan\u2019s plan to launch Allo this summer without encryption by default has drawn withering criticism from some quarters. Google\u2019s decision to disable encryption by default in its new #Allo chat app is dangerous, and makes it unsafe. Avoid it for now. \u2014 Edward Snowden (@Snowden) May 19, 2016 But other privacy advocates are more positive.",
        "Mosquitoes may be the absolute worst organism inhabiting Earth today. Setting aside the aggravation of billions of mosquito bites each year, the bugs are vectors of horrible diseases that kill literally hundreds of thousands of people annually. We\u2019ve all become acutely aware of this latter point with the sudden rise of the Zika virus, which is linked to birth defects and is now inching its way north through the Americas on the backs of several mosquito species.",
        "Hollywood actor mamas, they\u2019re just like us. Well, maybe a little. Robin Wright, star of the Netflix series \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d recently told the story of how she demanded to receive the same pay as Kevin Spacey or she\u2019d go public. Ends up she went public, but for a good reason: She\u2019s getting paid what she deserves since issuing her demands. Like many women who are paid less than their male counterparts, she noted that she fell behind when she became a mother."
