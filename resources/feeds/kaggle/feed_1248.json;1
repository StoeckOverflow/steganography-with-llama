        "In today\u2019s pop culture vernacular, it\u2019s an insult to be called basic \u2014 the opposite of cool and trendsetting. But in the nutrition world, being basic, as in alkaline, is aspirational, with popular books, websites and celebrities all endorsing a pH approach to eating. There is some serious science to back this trend, so it is worth paying attention to, but (surprise, surprise) there is a lot of confusing misinformation and hyperbole out there, too. The concept of the alkaline diet centers on the fact that different foods affect our body\u2019s pH balance differently.",
        "As the Obama administration prepares to publish a accounting of how many militants and noncombatant civilians it has killed since 2009, its statistics may be defined as much by what is left out as by what is included. Release of the information was first envisioned three years ago this month, as part of strict new guidelines President Obama announced for the United States\u2019 controversial use of drones and other forms of lethal force to battle terrorism abroad. Such operations, Obama said in a 2013 speech at the National Defense University, would also be subject to new transparency and oversight.",
        "PETERBOROUGH, England \u2014 Seen from London, Edinburgh, Oxford or other havens of the cosmopolitan British elite, this country\u2019s vote next month on whether to quit the European Union may appear to be a relatively easy choice. Not a day goes by when a foreign leader, renowned economist or military chief doesn\u2019t warn of the dire consequences of a vote to leave \u2014 for Britain and for the world.",
        "CAYEY, Puerto Rico \u2014 In a rural roadside restaurant here in the heart of Puerto Rico, the lunch rush was over, leaving only a handful of patrons to see a figure in black jeans and a polo shirt emerge from an SUV that pulled up outside. It was the 42nd president of the United States. Within minutes, just about everyone in the place had pulled out a smartphone for a photo with Bill Clinton.",

Struggling to rear four children largely alone, Hopkins was forced to go on disability in 2009.

        "Surveying the wreckage of the Middle East and the fraying of Europe, President Obama understandably would like us to believe that no other policy could have worked better. The United States has tried them all, his administration argues: massive invasion, in Iraq; surgical intervention, in Libya; studied aloofness, in Syria.

        "NORTHERN SYRIA The raw Sunni recruits in crisp camouflage uniforms, popping off rounds at the firing range at a U. S. training camp here, illustrate the dilemma for the United States as it seeks to form a strong military force to drive the Islamic State from its capital, Raqqah. David Ignatius writes a foreign affairs column and contributes to the PostPartisan blog. View Archive Facebook RSS The United States could try to build the Sunni army it would want, ideally, to capture Raqqah, a Sunni city. But that might take years.",
        "From the coverage of the 2016 campaign over the past six months, you would think that American workers battered by economic change have finally won their moment in the political sun. After all, Donald Trump is said to be the paladin of white, men, and Bernie Sanders speaks unabashedly about the working class, a term many have (wrongly) written off as an antique concept out of 1930s movies. But media interest in policy initiatives that would benefit those who are struggling is scarce.",
        "Could online lending cause the next financial crisis? While the odds seem overwhelmingly against it, the recent turmoil at LendingClub \u2014 a leading online lender \u2014 makes it hard not to ask the question. There are some disquieting parallels with subprime mortgages, which seemed beneficial until sloppy and fraudulent lending practices triggered a wider collapse of confidence. Are we about to repeat the cycle? In theory, online lending makes a lot of sense.",
        "FIRST TWO hours, now three hours \u2014 this is how far in advance authorities are recommending people show up to catch a domestic flight, at least at some major U. S. airports with increasingly massive security lines. The Transportation Security Administration is struggling to keep up with a spike in airline travel that could result in misery during peak summer vacation months. This is a totally unacceptable waste of time that violates the essential bargain between the TSA and air passengers. The TSA can do better \u2014 and it must.",
        "BAGHDAD \u2014 The Iraqi military said Sunday that it is preparing for an offensive to retake Fallujah, urging civilians to stay away from Islamic State headquarters and telling those who are unable to escape to raise white flags on their homes. The military statement gave no timeline for the operation but said counterterrorism forces, police, tribal fighters and popular mobilization units \u2014 which include an array of Shiite militias \u2014 will be involved. Fallujah has been under Islamic State control for more than two years and was the first city in the country to fall to the militant group.",
        "BOSTON \u2014 Lloyd Matsumoto awoke from his liver transplant last month to find his surgeon more than pleased with the results. The new organ had begun producing bile almost immediately, a welcome signal that it had quickly started to function well.

        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Artists, producers and actors are occupying public buildings across Brazil to protest the new government of interim president Michel Temer. Musicians railed against Temer at shows across Brazil this weekend, and their audiences sang for his ouster. Some chanted \u201cTemer out\u201d to a famous and melodramatic opera melody \u2014 its sense of impending apocalypse playing with unfounded Internet rumors that Brazil\u2019s unpopular new leader is a Satanist.

        "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 The U. S. airstrike thought to have killed Taliban chief Akhtar Mohammad Mansour over the weekend represents another escalation in U. S. involvement in the war in Afghanistan and signals a new willingness to target senior Taliban leaders on Pakistani soil, analysts and officials said Sunday. Although U. S. officials were awaiting final confirmation of Mansour\u2019s death, the strike early Saturday marks the most aggressive U.

        "If you want to make a politician really, really angry, endorse their primary opponent.

        "Donald Trump has cleared every electoral hurdle before him in this presidential race. He went from 1 percent, literally, to the top of the polls. He beat 16 other people for the Republican nomination. He finds himself in a statistical dead heat with likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. And, he has done it all by being himself: brash, bold, controversial and unapologetic. As the nation turns its eyes to the general election, I have one question that continues to nag at me as I think about the possibility of Trump in the White House: Can he be empathetic?",

Last year, we clocked about 40, 000 miles on our Honda Pilot, including three adventures and one memorable trek across Canada. Sometimes, I feel like a guest in my own home. And where is home?

What he does not have is the one thing that he needs to vote this presidential election: a current Texas photo ID.

Terry McAuliffe (D) and what they consider to be suspicious personal finances, as part of a public integrity probe that has lasted for more than a year, according to two officials familiar with the inquiry.

        "Full disclosure: The staff here at Spoiler Alerts has a soft spot for John Oliver. When he was a \u201cDaily Show\u201d correspondent, he managed to keep a straight face during the silliest bit in that show\u2019s history. He articulated the best response to the December 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks that exists. I don\u2019t always catch \u201cLast Week Tonight,\u201d but some of his extended riffs \u2014 such as the one about the Miss America pageant \u2014 are informative and funny. And he has been completely correct about Donald Drumpf."
