        "It\u2019s been highly amusing to watch the international press struggle to describe Norbert Hofer, the candidate who has just lost, by a tiny handful of votes, the Austrian presidential election. Hofer bitterly opposes immigration and uses nostalgic language about \u201c \u201d culture, views which place him in the \u201c \u201d category of European politics. At the same time, he and his Freedom Party denounce the \u201cneoliberal\u201d economic consensus and deplore the evils of international capitalism \u2014 views that place him in the \u201c \u201d category of European politics. It\u2019s a confusing mix.",
        "ANKARA A tour of the war zones in Iraq and Syria with the top U. S. commander ends, appropriately enough, here in Turkey, the strongest power in the region and the place where the modern troubles began a hundred years ago with the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. The abiding strategic fact about the current war against the Islamic State is that it\u2019s part of a bigger process of reordering the structure of this part of the world.",
        "We still do not know who or what is responsible for the crash of EgyptAir Flight 804, but we know this much for certain: The terrorist danger is growing, and it won\u2019t be contained to the Mediterranean. Responding to criticism of President Obama\u2019s handling of terrorism, White House press secretary Josh Earnest boasted Thursday of all the setbacks the Islamic State has experienced in recent months, noting that in Iraq \u201c45 percent of the populated area that ISIL previously controlled has been retaken from them. In Syria, that figure is now 20 percent.",
        "The last member of the group of British jailers who supervised the torture and killing of Western hostages held by the Islamic State has been identified as a Londoner who traveled to Syria in 2012. El Shafee Elsheikh, a British citizen whose family fled Sudan in the 1990s, was one of four jailers dubbed the \u201cBeatles\u201d by their prisoners because of their British accents. The cohort\u2019s most prominent figure was Mohammed Emwazi, better known as \u201cJihadi John,\u201d whose videotaped beheadings of American and British hostages became a global emblem of the Islamic State\u2019s brutality.",
        "IRS Chief John Koskinen will not appear before the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday to defend himself against charges that he defied a subpoena from Congress as it investigated the treatment of conservative groups and should be ousted from office. Aides to the embattled tax collector said Monday he has not had adequate time to prepare to testify. Koskinen returned to Washington from a trip to China on May 13, the same day committee Republicans announced they would hold the first of two hearings to consider impeaching him.",
        "BALTIMORE \u2014 A judge found police officer Edward M. Nero not guilty of all criminal charges in the case of Freddie Gray, whose death last year in police custody sparked riots and widespread anger in the city. The acquittal by Judge Barry G. Williams, announced Monday in a packed courtroom, is the first verdict reached in the Gray case. Nero is the second officer to face trial on charges related to Gray\u2019s arrest and death. The first officer\u2019s trial ended in a hung jury.",
        "The Supreme Court ruled Monday in favor of a black Georgia inmate who claimed that prosectors kept African Americans off the jury that convicted him of murdering an elderly white woman. The court ruled 7 to 1 that Georgia prosecutors had violated the Constitution by improperly considering race when selecting a jury to judge Timothy Tyrone Foster. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for the majority. Justice Clarence Thomas, the lone African American on the court, dissented, saying that the evidence that prosecutors acted improperly was not strong enough to overturn Foster\u2019s conviction.",
        "Facebook said Monday it will stop relying as much on other news outlets to inform what goes into its Trending Topics section \u2014 a part of Facebook\u2019s website that despite its small size has grown into a national political controversy amid accusations that the social network is stifling conservative voices on its platform. Under the change, Facebook will discontinue the algorithmic analysis of media organizations\u2019 websites and digital news feeds that partly determines which stories should be included in Trending Topics.",
        "In an election cycle in which the progressive wing of the Democratic Party is arguably louder and more powerful than ever, it\u2019s perhaps not a surprise that the party\u2019s top official has a primary challenger for the first time. Nor is it surprising that Democratic National Committee Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz\u2019s primary and to a lesser extent the Florida congresswoman\u2019s main challenger, law professor Tim Canova has the potential to become a battleground for the divide that\u2019s playing out at the presidential level.",
        "Unlike its faraway namesake, this Syria has no Muslims. It\u2019s a pretty village with trout in its rivers and black bears in its hills, home to many who cheer one of Donald Trump\u2019s most derided proposals: a ban on Muslims. Laurie Richards, the cashier at the general store, thinks the way others do: She doesn\u2019t like everything about Trump, but she thinks he is right to talk about temporarily barring Muslims from entering the United States. Islamist fanatics, responsible for the terrorist attacks, continue to commit murder from Brussels to San Bernardino, Calif. It only makes sense, she said.",
        "There are two big explanations for why rural counties, small towns and even cities have fallen behind America\u2019s largest, most innovative metro areas when it comes to job growth and new business formation. One is primarily about those \u201d \u201d areas: The sort of businesses and jobs they used to create in economic expansions simply aren\u2019t appearing at the same rate anymore, particularly in industries such as construction and manufacturing.",
        "It\u2019s a common tale. You want to lose weight and get fit, so you decide to work out more and cut calories, in particular all those starches \u2014 breads, rice, pasta and cereal \u2014 that we keep hearing are making us fat. Except it doesn\u2019t work. What gives? Weight loss doesn\u2019t always come down to calories in vs. calories out, especially when you are trying to find the balance between aerobic exercise and eating carbohydrates. It is essential to find the right mix for you.",
        "Signs of a rightward turn by Brazil s new government have alarmed conservationists and climate change activists who fear a rollback of environmental laws that could accelerate deforestation in the Amazon basin. With Brazil s economy in its worst slump since the 1930s, new leader Michel Temer took power this month promising a more agenda to spur growth. Temer named a \u00c2 cabinet whose members include figures with close ties to powerful landowners and agribusiness companies.",
        "Almost four months after promising $1 million of his own money to veterans\u2019 causes, Donald Trump moved to fulfill that pledge Monday evening \u2014 promising the entire sum to a single charity as he came under intense media scrutiny. Trump, now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, organized a nationally televised fundraiser for veterans\u2019 causes in Des Moines on Jan. 28. That night, Trump said he had raised $6 million, including the gift from his own pocket. \u201cDonald Trump gave $1 million,\u201d he said then.",
        "COMMERCE, Calif. \u2014 Democratic presidential Hillary Clinton has a new partner in her battle against Donald Trump: Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who gave a speech Tuesday mirroring Clinton\u2019s own talking points accusing Trump of profiting from the housing crash of 2008. Warren ( .) has stayed out of the ongoing Democratic primary race between Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont \u2014 she is the only Democratic woman in the Senate who has not endorsed Clinton \u2014 but she recently has become more aggressive in taking on Trump on his favorite medium, Twitter.",
        "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Like many Silicon Valley Larry Gadea\u2019s company collects heaps of sensitive data from his customers. Recently, he decided to do something with that data trove that was long considered unthinkable: He is getting rid of it. The reason? Gadea fears that one day the FBI might do to him what it did to Apple in their recent legal battle: demand that he give the agency access to his encrypted data. Rather than make what he considers a Faustian bargain, he\u2019s building a system that he hopes will avoid the situation entirely.",
        "Feeling exiled and frustrated in her Florida condominium, Ruthann Aron decided she needed a makeover. Not of the cosmetic variety but of the cosmic \u2014 a public image redo, which would not be particularly easy nearly 20 years after the trial that put her in a Maryland prison for hiring a hit man to murder her rich urologist husband. One step involved returning to Montgomery County, where all her troubles began and where she served on the county planning board and ran for the U. S. Senate. Another step involved hiring Victor. Victor Wainstein, 41, is Ruthann\u2019s attorney.",
        "NORRISTOWN, Pa. \u2014 A judge on Tuesday ordered Bill Cosby to stand trial in a sexual assault case, clearing the way for a momentous showdown between the iconic comedian and prosecutors. Judge Elizabeth McHugh took only a few moments to reach her decision after a contentious hearing in which Cosby\u2019s defense team aggressively sought to attack the credibility of his accuser: former Temple University women\u2019s basketball official Andrea Constand.",
        "Everything Rep. Darrell Issa knows about impeachment he learned from Wikipedia.

        "(We may never get to see the transcript of the chat conversation going on among the Hillary Clinton team right now, but I can only assume that were it leaked, it would go something like this.) IN CHAT: Hillary, Redacted, Redacted Redacted: Team! Did you read David Brooks today explaining why Hillary is disliked? Riveting stuff. He said that it was because nobody knows \u201cwhat Hillary Clinton does for fun[.] \u2026 when people talk about Clinton, they tend to talk of her exclusively in professional terms. \u2026 Clinton\u2019s career appears, from the outside, to be all consuming.",
        "Morning Consult reports that its poll found that 67 percent of American voters \u2014 and indeed, 60 percent of Republicans \u2014 \u201cthink presidential candidates should have to disclose their returns. Just one in five voters (21 percent) said they don\u2019t think the financial documents should have to be released. \u201d Perhaps not coincidentally, 27 percent of the electorate said they would support Libertarian Gary Johnson or don\u2019t know whom they will back. Could it be that the tax issue is Trump\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel?",
        "Each week, In Theory takes on a big idea in the news and explores it from a range of perspectives. This week, we\u2019re talking about pornography regulation. Need a primer? Catch up here. Matthew Schmitz is literary editor of First Things. It is time to ban pornography. Nothing can shock us except this suggestion. We find it perfectly acceptable that smut, no matter how bestial or misogynistic, should be widely available. We even think it a moral imperative, a dictate of freedom.",
        "William Yeomans, a fellow in law and government at American University\u2019s Washington College of Law, served in the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division from 1981 to 2005. Why are successful prosecutions of police officers so rare? Monday\u2019s acquittal of Baltimore police officer Edward M. Nero in connection with the death of Freddie Gray again raises that sobering question \u2014 and some of the usual explanations don\u2019t apply here. While prosecutors have all too often been reluctant to bring cases against those with whom they work, Baltimore City State\u2019s Attorney Marilyn Mosby charged the case promptly and aggressively.",
        "Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are now in an extended process of negotiating the terms of his surrender. But I\u2019m beginning to wonder if Sanders understands just how few cards he has left to play. Yesterday, the DNC announced the makeup of the committee that will decide the party\u2019s platform, with Clinton choosing six members, Sanders choosing five, and party chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz choosing four.",
        "BEIJING \u2014 China warned President Obama on Tuesday not to spark a fire in Asia after he announced the lifting of a embargo on lethal arms sales to Vietnam. Obama unveiled the historic step on Monday during his first visit to Vietnam, insisting the move was \u201cnot based on China\u201d while simultaneously acknowledging that Washington and Hanoi share a common concern about China\u2019s actions in the South China Sea.

        "Baylor declined to respond to reports Tuesday that President and Chancellor Kenneth Starr, best known for his investigation of the Clinton administration, has been fired by the Board of Regents in the wake of a sexual assault scandal involving the school and its football team.
