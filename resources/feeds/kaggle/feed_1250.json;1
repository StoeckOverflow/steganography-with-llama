        "Sen. Patrick J. Toomey ( .) said he hadn\u2019t thought about it. Sen. Kelly Ayotte ( . H.) sidestepped it. Sen. John McCain ( .) insisted that he had said enough. The question they faced: Would you campaign with Donald Trump? \u201cI\u2019m campaigning for myself,\u201d Ayotte said on a walk in the underground tunnel from the U. S. Capitol building to the Senate offices. An aide interjected to say that they were late for a meeting, cutting short the conversation. \u201cI have one priority and that\u2019s campaigning for myself,\u201d Ayotte added as she walked away.",

        "Some people in the crowd at a graduation ceremony at California State University, Fullerton, shouted at the commencement speaker after she talked about presidential candidate Donald Trump and gave a brief section of her address in Spanish. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad,\u201d the commencement speaker, Maria Elena Salinas, an anchor for Spanish language broadcast network Univision, said Tuesday. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a testament to what has happened in our country. Our country is really divided.",
        "Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) traveled the state Tuesday declaring himself innocent amid an ongoing federal investigation of his 2013 campaign and personal finances, as supporters and critics alike puzzled over its impact. McAuliffe, 59, plowed ahead with a full day of events across Virginia scheduled before news broke Monday about the FBI investigation into his finances. Asked for his reaction, McAuliffe offered one word: \u201cShock. \u201d He said no one from the Justice Department notified him or his administration about the ongoing probe.",
        "NEW ORLEANS \u2014 With a U. S. Supreme Court deadline looming, judges on a federal appeals court here Tuesday questioned whether accommodations could be made to protect minority voters and save Texas\u2019s law. Among the 15 judges of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit who heard oral arguments Tuesday morning, there did not seem to be much support for striking down the law or blocking its use in November\u2019s presidential election.",
        "(Benidorm, Spain, 2003 \u00a9 Martin Photos) Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock for the last few years I\u2019m sure you\u2019re oh so familiar with a tendency of your social media feeds to be choked to death with images of food (and maybe cats too, but certainly food). There are websites devoted to the fetishization of food, or \u201cfood porn. \u201d There\u2019s even a Reddit thread for it. But the pictures here are not food porn at all. Really, they aren\u2019t.",
        "A fresh string of attacks by Donald Trump this week on rivals in the GOP establishment \u2014 including one delivered against a prominent Latina governor in her home state \u2014 raised new doubts about his ability or desire to unite the party\u2019s badly fractured leadership. Now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Trump had been expected by many political strategists and party leaders to extend olive branches to his foes and vanquished opponents, many of whom could be crucial allies in the general election against the Democratic nominee, most likely Hillary Clinton.",

        "Pregnant women infected with the Zika virus during their first trimester face as high as a 13 percent chance that their fetus will develop a severe and rare brain defect, according to research published Wednesday. That condition, known as microcephaly, is characterized at birth by an abnormally small head and often incomplete brain development. Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health identified the sharply higher risk after analyzing data from one of the hardest hit areas in Brazil, the epicenter of the rapidly evolving Zika outbreak.",
        "Their names are Ted and James, and they look like the kinds of men you might bump into on the streets of Richmond, Va. where their father was born. But they\u2019re speaking perfect North Korean and wearing badges of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, the first two leaders of North Korea, over their hearts. Oh, and the younger one, James, is a captain in the North Korean army. They\u2019re the sons of James Joseph Dresnok, the former American GI who defected to North Korea in 1962 when he was stationed in South Korea after the war.",
        "On Tuesday night, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump disparaged New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, probably the most prominent Hispanic Republican officeholder in America, saying at a rally in Albuquerque that she has a bad record and \u201cshe\u2019s got to do a better job. \u201d At the same rally, where windows were smashed and Trump and his supporters clashed with demonstrators, the candidate also mocked Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s claim to Native American roots by repeatedly calling her \u201cPocahontas. \u201d And House Speaker Paul Ryan, sitting down with reporters on Wednesday, wanted to talk about policy?",
        "Jeffrey D. Sachs is director of the Earth Institute and a professor at Columbia University. Mainstream U. S. economists have criticized Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders\u2019s proposals as unworkable, but these economists betray the status quo bias of their economic models and professional experience. It\u2019s been decades since the United States had a progressive economic strategy, and mainstream economists have forgotten what one can deliver. In fact, Sanders\u2019s recipes are supported by overwhelming evidence \u2014 notably from countries that already follow the policies he advocates. On health care, growth and income inequality, Sanders wins the policy debate hands down.",
        "LONDON years ago, what has become the European Union was an embryo conceived in fear. It has been stealthily advanced from an economic to a political project, and it remains enveloped in a watery utopianism even as it becomes more dystopian. The E. U.\u2019s economic stagnation \u2014 in some of the 28 member nations, youth unemployment approaches 50 percent \u2014 is exacerbated by its regulatory itch and the wound of the euro, a common currency for radically dissimilar nations. The E. U. is floundering amid mass migration, the greatest threat to Europe\u2019s domestic tranquility since 1945. The E.",
        "As if we didn\u2019t have enough to worry about already, here comes a new issue: The Great Cheese Glut of 2016. The Wall Street Journal reports that as of March 31, 1. 19 billion pounds had accumulated in commercial freezers across the United States, the largest stockpile ever. This affects an entire global industry, from Wisconsin Dells to Whole Foods shelves. Yet each American would have to eat an extra 3 pounds of cheese this year, on top of the 36 pounds we already consume per capita, to eliminate the big yellow mountain.",
        "Here\u2019s the irony of Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First,\u201d nationalism: It is a European import. The American right has typically been reverent of the Constitution, suspicious of political strongmen and resolute in insisting that \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d makes us different from other nations. But Trumpism is not an American original. Almost every plank in the candidate\u2019s vaguely defined platform is derivative of the European far right. It is gaining ground on the basis of opposition to immigration, fears of terrorism and crime, economic nationalism, and promises of a government wielding a muscular hand against the forces of disorder.",
        "Eleven states and state officials filed a lawsuit Wednesday challenging the Obama administration over federal guidance directing schools to allow transgender students to use restrooms and other facilities that match their gender identities. The federal lawsuit, filed in the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, states that the guidance \u201chas no basis in law\u201d and could cause \u201cseismic changes in the operations of the nation\u2019s school districts.",
        "Long lines at the nation\u2019s airports may continue through the summer, the result of record travel, understaffed checkpoints and changes made to reduce the risk of terrorist attacks, the head of the Transportation Security Administration told Congress on Wednesday. TSA Administrator Peter V. Neffenger said that even with additional staffing help on the way, Americans could expect scant relief from long waits to clear security checkpoints. \u201cClearly, the summer travel season is going to be busy,\u201d he told the House Homeland Security Committee.",
        "KABUL \u2014 Just days after a U. S. drone strike killed the leader of the Taliban, the insurgent group named his successor Wednesday in a move that appeared to signal a blow to peace efforts by Afghanistan\u2019s government. Haibatullah Akhundzada, a cleric and once the Taliban\u2019s top judge, was a deputy under Akhtar Mohammad Mansour, who was killed in Pakistan\u2019s Baluchistan province on Saturday. Akhundzada\u2019s appointment could strengthen the group by easing infighting among Taliban factions, but it appeared to undercut Afghan and U. S.",
        "As 2nd Lt. Alix Schoelcher Idrache stood at attention during the commencement ceremony at West Point, N. Y. on Saturday, he was overcome with emotion. Tears rolled down both cheeks, but his gloved left hand held firm on his white, gold and black \u201ccover,\u201d the dress headgear that Army cadets wear. The photograph of Idrache, by Army Staff Sgt. Vito T. Bryant, was published Tuesday on the Facebook page of West Point\u2019s U. S. Military Academy, and it almost immediately went viral.",
        "U. S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( .) just made a striking admission: Speaking to a group of marijuana activists on Capitol Hill, Rohrabacher said he had recently turned to medical marijuana to help deal with arthritis pain, and it worked. Two weeks ago, Rohrabacher said, he tried a topical marijuana treatment. That night, it was \u201dthe first time in a year and a half that I had a decent night\u2019s sleep because the arthritis pain was gone,\u201d Rohrabacher said. Rohrabacher is one of the leading conservative voices on overhauling marijuana laws in the U. S. Congress.",
        "When a teammate held out his arms after football practice in their high school locker room, the student thought he was about to get a hug. Instead, he got viciously raped, authorities say. As the teammate restrained the victim, another football player allegedly thrust a coat hanger into the victim\u2019s rectum, according to a criminal complaint. Then a third teammate kicked the coat hanger several times. The Oct. 23, 2015, incident has rocked the tiny town of Dietrich, Idaho. This spring, after several months of investigation, the state attorney general\u2019s office filed sexual assault charges against the three.",
        "COLUMBIA, S. C. \u2014 Republican Gov. Nikki Haley signed legislation Wednesday that immediately outlaws most abortions in South Carolina at 20 weeks beyond fertilization. The only exceptions are if the mother\u2019s life is in jeopardy or a doctor determines the fetus can\u2019t survive outside the womb. Doctors face up to $10, 000 in fines and 3 years in prison for each violation; prison time is mandatory on a third conviction. These bans are now in effect in at least 13 states and blocked by court challenges in several others. South Dakota\u2019s ban takes effect July 1.",
        "On Tuesday, WaPo\u2019s Dave Fahrenthold got to the bottom of one of the big mysteries of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign: Did he really raise and donate $6 million \u2014 including $1 million of his own money \u2014 to veterans\u2019 organizations as he had boasted for months? I was fascinated by how Fahrenthold harnessed the power of social media to finally pin down Trump and get some answers. I reached out to Dave to pick his brain about why the story initially interested him and how and when he decided to take his reporting to Twitter.",
        "SANTA MONICA, Calif. \u2014 The deadline to register for the June 7 Democratic primary here was looming. As people trickled into a Bernie Sanders rally at Santa Monica High School, Josh Ehrhart was chasing the clock \u2014 and confronting Sanders supporters reluctant to become Democrats. Ehrhart offered registration forms and pens and assured them it would be harmless and temporary. \u201cI\u2019m all about who the candidate is,\u201d said Ehrhart, 32, who left the Green Party to vote for Sanders. \u201cIf Bernie stays in, obviously I\u2019ll stay a Democrat.",
        "House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Wednesday he will not be rushed into an endorsement of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, tamping down speculation that he was moving toward a declaration of support. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t have a timeline in my mind, and I have not made a decision,\u201d Ryan ( .) told reporters summoned to his Capitol office suite. \u201cNothing has changed from that perspective, and we\u2019re still having productive conversations.",
        "Anthony Senatore never disputed leaving his rifle under his bed, unsecured and loaded. The New Jersey father pleaded guilty in 2014 to child endangerment after his son accidentally used the gun to shoot and kill Brandon Holt, a neighbor, at Senatore\u2019s Toms River home, according to NJ. com. More than three years after the shooting, a judge had to do the unthinkable: Determine how much the child\u2019s death was worth monetarily to the people who loved him most \u2014 his parents. The answer: $572, 588.",
        "That Navy SEAL Chris Kyle served with distinction in combat is not in dispute. The celebrated Iraq War veteran braved enemy fire numerous times while deployed to some of that war\u2019s most intense battlegrounds. During the 2004 fight to take back the city of Fallujah, for example, he exhibited \u201cunparalleled bravery and skill as a sniper\u201d and \u201cserved as an example to all,\u201d according to a performance evaluation released to the website MuckRock last year.",
        "The lines outside Venezuelan supermarkets can stretch for hours, snaking down sidewalks and around corners. Each one is like a hissing fuse. Will they explode? Venezuela withers away a little more each week. Another food staple or medicine or industrial part goes missing, bringing the breaking point closer. The national guard troops policing the supermarket lines grip their riot shields and truncheons tighter, looking ever more jittery. Panoramic view of the Caracas slum Petare, one of the largest in Latin America. (Alejandro Cegarra for The Washington Post) A man waits outside a government supermarket to buy food.",
        "This post has been updated. For the first time, researchers have found a person in the United States carrying bacteria resistant to antibiotics of last resort, an alarming development that the top U. S. public health official says could signal \u201dthe end of the road\u201d for antibiotics. The strain was found last month in the urine of a Pennsylvania woman. Defense Department researchers determined that she carried a strain of E. coli resistant to the antibiotic colistin, according to a study published Thursday in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, a publication of the American Society for Microbiology.",
        "House Speaker Paul D. Ryan finds himself in the middle of yet another Republican civil war as the battle over LGBT rights has come to Congress, threatening to divide an already fractured GOP. It is a fight the speaker does not want to have \u2014 especially in a competitive election year in which presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy is already tearing the party apart."
