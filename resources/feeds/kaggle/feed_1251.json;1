        "It\u2019s been called a hostile takeover of the Republican Party, but there\u2019s little that has happened since Donald Trump became the GOP\u2019s presumptive nominee to suggest he wants anything to do with the party. He\u2019s borrowing the brand for his own purposes. In all ways, Trump continues to show that he is the candidate. That\u2019s especially the case with any notions of him becoming the leader of a political party. Trump is a singular politician unlike any who has risen as fast and as far as he has in modern times.",
        "Baylor University demoted president Kenneth Starr and fired its popular football coach Art Briles following revelations Thursday that the sports program responded to sexual assault accusations against its players with alarming indifference or outright hostility toward alleged victims. The Texas university\u2019s Board of Regents apologized to the school community for the findings of an outside investigation it commissioned in the fall.",
        "RIO DE JANEIRO \u201d As he struggles to build support for his presidency, Brazil s new leader, Michel Temer, has been dogged by the kind of character issue that pollsters refer to as a strong negative. ? Temer, rumor has it, is a devil worshiper. The origins of this falsehood are unclear. Temer, 75, a longtime politician, is a Christian of Maronite Lebanese descent. But the rumors have inflicted enough damage that Temer turned to prominent evangelical pastors for help. They encouraged him to make a video appealing for evangelicals support. He did a beautiful video, ?",
        "The writer served on the Federal Trade Commission from 1997 to 2003. It is beyond contempt that a politician would use a family tragedy to further his candidacy, but such is the character of Donald Trump displayed in his recent comments to The Washington Post. In this interview, Trump cynically, crassly and recklessly insinuated that my brother, Vincent W. Foster Jr. may have been murdered because \u201che had intimate knowledge of what was going on\u201d and that Hillary Clinton may have somehow played a role in Vince\u2019s death. How wrong. How irresponsible. How cruel.",
        "IT MIGHT be a fun parlor game, if the future of the country weren\u2019t at stake: How many lies by Donald Trump can be found in one news article? Post reporter David A. Fahrenthold set out to get a few simple answers about Mr. Trump\u2019s claims of donating to veterans. What he got were lies and evasions about practically every detail. Mr. Trump made a show of raising what he said was $6 million for veterans groups, including a $1 million donation from himself, at an Iowa campaign event in January.",
        "Danielle Allen is a political theorist at Harvard University and a contributing columnist for The Post. A few weeks ago, I argued that the likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton should take up the theme that it\u2019s time to make America fair, for everyone. Who doesn\u2019t want fairness? I asked. Women do; men do. Black, Latino, Muslim and white Americans all want fairness. Religious Americans want fairness, and so do gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: The California Democratic primary is tightening, and a Bernie Sanders victory on June 7th \u2014 while not altering the final outcome \u2014 would no doubt persuade him and his supporters to push for maximum concessions, perhaps all the way to the floor of the Democratic convention in Philadelphia. But no matter how contentious things end up getting, Democrats are very likely to unify in the end. A new analysis by political scientist Alan Abramowitz explains why: Democratic voters really like Barack Obama, and they really hate Donald Trump.",
        "The downfall of a top official in the Transportation Security Administration this week came amid allegations of bonuses and targeted retribution at the highest levels of the agency. One of the practices that led to Kelly Hoggan\u2019s removal as head of the TSA\u2019s crucial security division is common enough to have a name: smurfing. \u201cSmurfing is breaking specific financial transactions into something below the reporting requirement, which is what happened here,\u201d said John Roth, inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security.",
        "OKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 Some public schools are starting summer vacation several days early. Others are contemplating a week to cut costs. And more than 200 teachers in Oklahoma City were handed pink slips in March. But instead of addressing a burgeoning budget crisis that threatens public education and other critical state services, Oklahoma lawmakers have been busy debating proposals to criminalize abortion, police students\u2019 access to public bathrooms and impeach President Obama. With more painful cuts to come, Democrats are accusing the legislature of creating a \u201csmokescreen\u201d to distract the public from an estimated $1.",
        "The price of crude oil popped over $50 a barrel Thursday for the first time this year, bolstered by declines in U. S. stockpiles, gradually rising global consumption and steady declines in U. S. shale oil production. The U. S. benchmark grade of oil, West Texas Intermediate, closed the day down slightly at $49. 35 a barrel, and the international benchmark Brent grade settled at $50. 09 a barrel. But prices have been moving up recently, and they augur higher prices at the pump for consumers.",
        "The investigation of a \u201csexting\u201d case involving a Prince William County teenager, and the desire by prosecutors and police to repeatedly obtain photos of his genitalia, sparked a national uproar in the summer of 2014. Authorities backed down from their second search warrant for explicit photos, and the teen was placed on probation. The case took a further turn last December when the detective, David E. Abbott Jr. was accused of molesting two young boys and killed himself as police moved to arrest him at his Gainesville townhouse. But the case isn\u2019t over.",
        "After an epic duel of word masters, an Texan and a New Yorker tied Thursday night in the Scripps National Spelling Bee, the third year in a row two victors shared the championship trophy. Crowd favorite Nihar Saireddy Janga, a who charmed the audience and many on social media with his slight voice and knowledge of obscure words, and Jairam Hathwar, whose brother Sriram Hathwar was a in 2014, were declared this year\u2019s champions.",
        "Some D. C. neighborhoods just seem presidential. Maybe it\u2019s the foliage. The grand embassies. The oasis of quiet splendor in the middle of a booming metropolis. The ability to live in a rambling mansion on a hill, but, like Batman, swoop into the city whenever required. Case in point: Kalorama. The tony Northwest neighborhood perched above Rock Creek and just northwest of Dupont Circle is where the Obamas are expected to settle in January after leaving the White House.",
        "Paul Manafort, the man charged with electing Donald Trump president in the fall, sat down with HuffPo\u2019s Howard Fineman earlier this week to talk about his candidate and the broader race. The interview is filled with Trumpian bluster \u2014 \u201dthis is not a hard race,\u201d Manafort told Fineman of the general election against Hillary Clinton \u2014 mixed with remarkably candid looks into how The Donald operates as a candidate. Here\u2019s the one thing Manafort said that amazed me the most.",
        "Bernie Sanders really wants another debate before the California primary on June 7. First, he wanted to debate Democratic primary opponent Hillary Clinton. Then, when she said he challenged presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, saying the two should face off on live television. Last night on \u201dJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d Trump seemed to accept that challenge. And the prospect of an actual, debate seemed possible, if only for a few hours. Game on. I look forward to debating Donald Trump in California before the June 7 primary.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 The elevator goes up to the 39th floor, and through a pair of double doors, a neon paper airplane glows on the wall. Staffers pass through the lobby dressed stylishly casual, as if they\u2019re heading to brunch or maybe a concert. There are few hints about the businesses that weave together these cubicles and glass offices \u2014 plus those one floor below.",
        "Corrected U. S. Air Force Master Sgt. Melvin Rector long carried Britain in his heart after he helped defend it during World War II, but 70 years passed without him stepping foot in the country. The finally decided to leave his home in Barefoot Bay, Fla. to visit Britain earlier this month. The National World War II Museum in New Orleans conducts a travel program through which interested parties can visit certain sites of the war. He signed up for one, in hopes of visiting the Royal Air Force station Snetterton Heath, in Norfolk.",
        "PALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 Stanford cardiologist Alan Yeung has embarked on what may be the most audacious study of exercise in history. Using an app on those ubiquitous gadgets that many of us carry around \u2014 our smartphones, fitness watches and other electronic devices \u2014 Yeung and his colleagues are mapping the minutiae of how we move. Not just the count of our steps, but all sorts of measures, including our velocity and orientation in space. Just a year in, the results already are provocative. For starters, America\u2019s lifestyle may be worse than anyone thought.",
        "It\u2019s been a busy week for conservative social issues: South Carolina passed a law barring almost all abortions after 20 weeks\u2019 gestation, 11 states sued the Obama administration over its transgender directives and the House is fighting over legislation affecting gays and lesbians. Absent from the flurry of activity? Donald Trump. Social issues continue to roil Republican politics, but they are largely missing from the presidential campaign of a candidate who shows little interest in abortion, religious liberty and other topics most important to social conservatives.",
        "Over the course of his presidential bid, Sen. Marco Rubio called Donald Trump a \u201ccon man\u201d who was \u201cdangerous\u201d and unqualified to control the nation\u2019s nuclear codes. He ridiculed the businessman\u2019s manhood and warned he would \u201cfracture\u201d the Republican Party if he was the nominee. By March \u2014 a few days before Rubio dropped out \u2014 the senator from Florida said with a cracking voice that it was \u201cgetting harder every day\u201d to envision supporting his rival.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 Wandering through Times Square, past the Naked Cowboy and the Elmos and the ticket touts, she could be any immigrant trying to live the American Dream. A Korean woman with a soft perm and conservative clothes, she\u2019s taking a weekend off from pressing shirts and hemming pants at the business she runs with her husband. But she\u2019s not just any immigrant. She\u2019s an aunt to Kim Jong Un, the young North Korean leader who has threatened to wipe out New York with a hydrogen bomb.",
        "Burned by negative reviews, some health providers are casting their patients\u2019 privacy aside and sharing intimate details online as they try to rebut criticism. In the course of these arguments which have spilled out publicly on ratings sites like Yelp \u2014 doctors, dentists, chiropractors and massage therapists, among others, have divulged details of patients\u2019 diagnoses, treatments and idiosyncrasies.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: Believe it or not, Donald Trump has now made a very important policy statement. Introducing what he billed as an \u201cenergy plan,\u201d Trump promised to \u201ccancel the Paris Climate Plan. \u201d Unlike so much of what comes from Trump on policy, this is a genuinely clarifying moment, with potentially enormous implications. The political consequences of this will \u2014 or should \u2014 be that there is now no chance whatsoever that Bernie Sanders will do anything at all on his way out that could imperil party unity in a way that makes a Trump victory more likely.",
        "It\u2019s true: Kids Today are more dependent on their parents than Kids Yesterday. At least when it comes to housing. Nearly a third of Americans age 18 to 34 were living with their parents in 2014, according to a new analysis from the Pew Research Center. That\u2019s the highest share since the Great Depression. It was also the first time since at least 1880 that young adults were more likely to live in their parents\u2019 homes than in their own households with a spouse or other romantic partner.",
        "The report on Hillary Clinton s email by the State Department s inspector general this week was devastating  \u201d not because of how she handled email but because of how she handled investigators. The report s revelations weren t particularly revelatory: Clinton violated department policies and went further than predecessors in her use of private email, but she wasn t the first to take this path. Beyond that, as my colleagues Rosalind Helderman and Tom Hamburger reported",
        "How do you distinguish a foreign policy \u201cidealist\u201d from a \u201crealist,\u201d an optimist from a pessimist? Ask one question: Do you believe in the arrow of history? Or to put it another way, do you think history is cyclical or directional? Are we condemned to do the same damn thing over and over, generation after generation \u2014 or is there hope for some enduring progress in the world order? For realists, generally conservative, history is an endless cycle of clashing power politics. The same patterns repeat. Only the names and places change.",
        "REYHANLI, Turkey \u2014 Throughout the fiasco of the Pentagon\u2019s $500 million effort to train and equip a force of Syrian rebels to take on the Islamic State, one small group endured. The New Syrian Army completed the U. S. training course in Jordan, infiltrated into Syria and then, in March, without fanfare or publicity, seized a pinprick of territory from the militants at the remote Tanaf border crossing with Iraq in the far southeast corner of the Syrian province of Homs.",
        "HIROSHIMA, Japan \u2014 Nearly 71 years after an American bomber passed high above this Japanese city on a clear August morning on a mission that would alter history, President Obama on Friday made a a solemn visit to Hiroshima to offer respects to the victims of the world\u2019s first deployed atomic bomb. In the Hiroshima Peace Park guest book, Obama wrote: \u201cWe have known the agony of war. Let us now find the courage, together, to spread peace, and pursue a world without nuclear weapons.",
        "Planes: They\u2019re where we get drunk. Where we brawl. Where we disable the restroom smoke detectors and light cigarettes. Where we glare at crying children. Where we jam our knees into the backs of the fellow travelers who dare recline their seats. Where we allow our racial paranoia to imagine terrorist threats in the seats around us \u2014 a man taking a nap before takeoff, a college student speaking Arabic on the phone, an Ivy League economist scribbling some differential equations on a notepad. We are not our best selves on airplanes.",
        "LOS ANGELES \u2014 On Tuesday, at a rally in Orange County, Sen. Bernie Sanders finally learned how to pronounce Cenk Uygur\u2019s name. In Irvine, it had been \u201cChenk. \u201d Once, it was \u201cSenk. \u201d This time, at Anaheim\u2019s convention center, Cenk Uygur introduced Sanders, the senator thanked \u201cJenk \u201d and the crowd cheered. \u201cA lot of you know the Young Turks?\u201d asked Sanders, referring to the online news empire Uygur launched in 2002. The cheers gave him his answer. \u201cWe live in a world where the corporate media, people who own our country, give us their definition of reality."
