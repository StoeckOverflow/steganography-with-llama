        "Hillary Clinton swung and missed earlier this week when asked to respond to a highly critical State Department inspector general\u2019s report regarding her decision to exclusively use a private email server while serving as secretary of state. Her initial response, delivered in an interview Wednesday with Univision\u2019s Marie Elena Salinas, was robotic and rotely defensive \u2014 not to mention inaccurate on several points. To her credit, Clinton (and her team) realized that what she had said wasn\u2019t enough. So she set about trying to fix it.",

        "Patty Ris doesn\u2019t have a favorite seat in the dining room at the Deupree House, a senior living facility in Cincinnati, where she recently took up residence.

        "Just minutes before his birthday, Masonda Ketanda Olivier was beaten to death. The Congolese national was confronted by a mob of men late at night last Friday in New Delhi and killed. Police said the incident was a dispute over the hiring of an autorickshaw; Olivier\u2019s friend, an Ivorian national, said it was a clear hate crime, with racial epithets repeatedly invoked. This week, irate African diplomats in the Indian capital pointed to Olivier\u2019s murder as evidence of wider discrimination and bigotry against black people who visit and live in India.",

        "For the past two months, Donald Trump has presided over a political team riddled with turf wars, staff reshuffling and dueling power centers. But the tensions are more than typical campaign chaos: They illustrate how Trump likes to run an organization, whether it\u2019s a real estate venture or his presidential bid. Interviews with current and former Trump associates reveal an executive who is fond of promoting rivalries among subordinates, wary of delegating major decisions, scornful of convention and fiercely insistent on a culture of loyalty around him.",

        "You could remake \u201cRoots\u201d every 10 years or so and end up with a different context each time. The original 1977 miniseries, which spanned eight nights on ABC and captivated something like 130 million TV watchers, pushed hard outside our cultural comfort zones, reaching so deep that even I remember thoughtful classroom discussions of \u201cRoots\u201d in just about the whitest childhood a kid could have.",
        "SAN DIEGO \u2014 Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican nominee, savaged President Obama here Friday for what she termed his \u201capology lap\u201d in Hiroshima, a Japanese city destroyed by a U.

        "My sister always wanted bookshelves. So when she bought a apartment in downtown Washington, she hired a carpenter. Soon, there were glossy cookbooks as you stepped through the front door, fiction when you crossed the living room, travelogues by her desk, academic tomes at the foot of her bed. I remember admiring all her novels, saying I wished to have read all she had. So little time to read everything. Emily turned 39 in November 2010. Her breast cancer was diagnosed three months later, and she died on May 16, 2012.",
        "Christopher J. Scalia works at a public relations firm in Washington. So far in the 2016 presidential race, Hillary Clinton has positioned herself as a pragmatist, what Michael Tomasky in the Daily Beast calls \u201ca type\u201d of politician. This is probably a smart move, as it allows her to distinguish herself from Bernie Sanders\u2019s idealism during the primaries, while also setting her up to face off against the erratic force that is Donald Trump. As the candidates steer toward the general election, however, perhaps it\u2019s time to reconsider whether she\u2019s the only pragmatist in the race.",
        "This week, media circles buzzed over the news that wrestler Hulk Hogan\u2019s lawsuit against Gawker Media has been bankrolled by a surprising patron: billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel.

As Thiel told the New York Times, \u201cI saw Gawker pioneer a unique and incredibly damaging way of getting attention by bullying people even when there was no connection with the public interest. . . .",
        "Of the nation\u2019s four major sports, hockey ranks last in popularity. But its championship trophy, the Stanley Cup, is arguably the most famous of the batch. It\u2019s also the oldest, dating to 1892 \u2014 54 years before the National Basketball Association was born. In fact, the NBA was created partly to fill hockey arenas when the home teams were away. The Stanley Cup is the only one of the four trophies that isn\u2019t replaced every year, and it has generated more myths than the three others combined.",

        "The atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima 71 years ago was one second of blinding whiteness; 10 seconds of pulsing, searing energy; months of sickness and destruction; and years of blood cancers and worrying and rebuilding. For the hundreds of thousands exposed to the blast, the bomb known as \u201cLittle Boy\u201d created destruction both vast and personal, instant and lifelong. When world leaders travel to Hiroshima \u2014 as President Obama just did \u2014 they tend to home in on the symbolism of the city, using it as a warning about the potency of weapons and the essentialness of peace.",
