        "By now, Hillary Clinton almost certainly expected that she would be well into a general election fight against Donald Trump \u2014 punching down at the real estate developer amid polls showing her sweeping into the White House. Not so much. Instead, Clinton spent the week in California, fighting for votes in advance of the Golden State\u2019s June 7 primary against the challenge of Bernie Sanders. But that was a cakewalk compared with what came out of Washington on Tuesday.",
        "Candace Bushnell \u2014 yes, that Candace Bushnell, who wrote the original \u201cSex and the City\u201d columns that spawned the TV series \u2014 gave Tinder a spin (or 20) and wrote all about it for Cosmopolitan. It\u2019s been a while since she\u2019s been on the prowl. Bushnell wrote in her Cosmo essay that she hadn\u2019t been on a date since 2002, when she met the man who\u2019s now her . \u201cWhen people asked me about dating,\u201d she writes, \u201cI would look at them like they were crazy. \u201d I\u2019m one of those people.",
        "Take a look around you and you\u2019ll see an endless range of body types: scrawny, lithe, pudgy, toned \u2014 even Hulklike upper bodies paired with skinny chicken legs. We might tell ourselves we\u2019re fitter than one person because we\u2019re more dedicated or that we\u2019re scrawnier than someone else because of genetics. But how much of one\u2019s body shape is predetermined, and how much can we control? \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of both,\u201d says Elizabeth Brooks, D. C. personal trainer. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the most ectomorph person change their shape into a bodybuilder type.",
        "Interviews by Nina Patel Joe loves University of Alabama college sports and wants a woman who can laugh along with him at \u201cArcher. \u201d Texan Madelyne is a voracious reader, a good conversationalist and is attracted to outdoorsy men.

        "SAN DIEGO \u2014 Donald Trump could have taken a victory lap last week. Instead, he went on a grudge tour. During his first big campaign swing since locking up the Republican presidential nomination, Trump went after an odd and seemingly random group of people \u2014 Democrats and Republicans, famous and obscure. There seemed little to gain politically from the attacks, and his targets were linked by just one thing: Trump felt they had all done him wrong. So he blasted Republicans who have yet to endorse him, including Jeb Bush, New Mexico Gov.",
        "Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said Sunday that illegal immigrants receive better care than the nation\u2019s veterans, electrifying an overwhelmingly supportive crowd at the annual Rolling Thunder tribute to the armed forces. Trump has mocked Sen. John McCain ( .) for being captured during the Vietnam War and faced questions about his giving to veterans\u2019 causes, but those issues did little to dampen the enthusiasm for his message at the Lincoln Memorial.",
        "HOLLYWOOD, Fla. \u201d Tim Canova was driving from a rally against money in politics to a protest against chemical giant Monsanto this month when his spokeswoman called to tell him that Sen. Bernie Sanders had just gone on CNN and endorsed his primary challenge against the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. It was a rather big moment for a law professor with a shaved head who, in another year, might not have created so much as a ripple for Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who is seeking her seventh House term and has won all her previous elections in landslides.",
        "LANZHOU NEW AREA, China \u2014 This city is supposed to be the \u201cdiamond\u201d on China\u2019s Silk Road Economic Belt \u2014 a new metropolis carved out of the mountains in the country\u2019s arid northwest. But it is shaping up to be fool\u2019s gold, a ghost city in the making. Lanzhou New Area, in Gansu province, embodies China\u2019s twin dreams of catapulting its poorer western regions into the economic mainstream through an orgy of infrastructure spending and cementing its place at the heart of Asia through a revival of the ancient Silk Road.",
        "The threatened summer of discontent for American travelers got underway Memorial Day weekend as the understaffed Transportation Security Administration struggled to keep its security lines moving in the nation\u2019s airports. The backups happened at most big airports and some smaller ones, particularly at the choice hours when passengers prefer to fly, and they seemed to occur most often when a particular flight was drawing hundreds of passengers to a single checkpoint. At Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International that was Terminal 3, surprisingly, at 7 a. m. Sunday. At Boston\u2019s Logan International the crush at B1 came at 4:40 p. m. Saturday.",
        "Clinton Romesha is a former Army staff sergeant and author of \u201cRed Platoon: A True Story of American Valor. \u201d He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the defense of Combat Outpost Keating. In October 2009, my cavalry troop was preparing to shut down a remote outpost in Afghanistan when we were assaulted by more than 300 insurgents. In violation of the most basic principles of warfare, our base, Combat Outpost Keating, had been built in a valley surrounded by three mountains.",
        "THE COUNTRY\u2019S war dead are a kind of closed society, elevated above us by service and sacrifice \u2014 in Shakespeare\u2019s words, \u201ca royal fellowship of death. \u201d We can talk of their courage and sacrifice and make speeches praising their patriotism, but we really have only an inkling of how men (and an increasing number of women) have faced the horrors of combat \u2014 and what motivated or compelled them to fight and risk their lives.",
        "Unless you are a pacifist, you accept that evil acts \u2014 the destruction of other human lives \u2014 can be justified, even necessary, in pursuit of good and urgent ends. But unless you are amoral, you also acknowledge the human capacity for and selfishness. People are quite capable of justifying the utterly unjustifiable by draping their immoral actions behind sweeping ethical claims. And if you are a responsible political leader, you must recognize both sides of this moral equation and still not allow yourself to be paralyzed.",
        "This month, the United States delivered the first batch of 762 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles to Egypt free of charge. That\u2019s on top of the $1. 3 billion in military aid the Obama administration has allocated to the regime of Abdel Fatah this year. The White House refuses to condition these gifts on an improvement in Egypt\u2019s horrendous human rights record. So herewith a more modest proposal: Obama should ask Sissi to publicly explain how the MRAPs fit into the \u201c war.",
        "Maybe the middle class isn\u2019t quite so stressed anymore. We in the media are rightly criticized for a pessimistic bias. We cover the unfortunate, the grim and the tragic. News is what people don\u2019t know and, as often as not, is sad or shocking. Our prism on the world distorts reality, because reality is often predictable and reassuring, while we aim to be surprising and upsetting. A case in point: the Federal Reserve\u2019s recently released \u201cReport on the Economic of U. S. Households in 2015. \u201d Although full of upbeat news, it received scant media attention.",
        "LAST WEEK\u2019S Wall Street News poll shows that voters think Donald Trump would handle the economy better than would Hillary Clinton. But from his destructive tax proposals to the illogical energy plan he detailed on Thursday, there is little basis for that belief. Mr. Trump\u2019s vision on energy, as on almost everything, starts with the premise that the country\u2019s politicians have sold out the American people.",
        "More than 700 migrants died in the Mediterranean Sea last week as their boats foundered, aid and refugee agencies estimated Sunday, with most of them attempting to flee the Libyan coast for Italy in the deadliest period of migration to Europe this year. The sinkings raise concerns that Europe is facing yet another summer with an overwhelming surge of new arrivals and intensify the debate over how to handle them.",
        "The Pastor Matthew Williams had gone to seminary, was ordained and thought he understood why people suffer. \u201cGod allows suffering because this world is temporary,\u201d is how he would have put it. Then came two deployments as an Army chaplain, one to Afghanistan and one to Iraq. Williams spent a year in an Afghanistan morgue unzipping body bags and \u201cseeing your friends\u2019 faces all blown apart. \u201d He watched as most of the marriages he officiated for fellow soldiers fell apart.",
        "We knew this was coming. For months, coral reef experts have been loudly, and sometimes mournfully, announcing that much of the treasured Great Barrier Reef has been hit by \u201csevere\u201d coral bleaching, thanks to abnormally warm ocean waters. Bleaching, though, isn\u2019t the same as coral death. When symbiotic algae leave corals\u2019 bodies and the animals then turn white or \u201cbleach,\u201d they can still bounce back if environmental conditions improve.",
        "A gorilla was fatally shot at an Ohio zoo this weekend after it picked up a young boy who had tumbled into an exhibit, officials said. (Courtesy of Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden) The encounter at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden occurred Saturday afternoon when the boy crawled through a barrier and fell into a moat at the facility\u2019s outdoor gorilla center, zoo director Thane Maynard told reporters.",
        "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 A new era for the Indianapolis 500 arrived in the form of a most unfamiliar driver. An American, no less. Alexander Rossi outlasted his faster rivals \u2014 and his fuel tank \u2014 for a stunning victory Sunday in the historic 100th running of \u201cThe Greatest Spectacle In Racing. \u201d The unlikely win allowed the Andretti family to celebrate in the biggest race of their storied careers and it left the top drivers in the field fuming over Rossi\u2019s good fortune. Rossi was a long shot and certainly not the driver anyone would have picked to win.",
        "On the list of topics that researchers \u2014 sociologists, political scientists, economists, criminologists, workplace pollsters and even biologists \u2014 have been known to study is honesty. And with reason. Honesty underpins the function of our courts and our personal relationships, our electoral system, our operations and our workplaces. And in the world of studies, a exists: These researchers examine what role, if any, gender plays in honesty.",
        "ORLANDO \u2014 Former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson won the Libertarian Party\u2019s presidential nomination on Sunday, fending off five rivals from different factions on two closely fought ballots and securing more than 55. 8 percent of the total vote. \u201cI will work as hard as I can to represent everyone in this room,\u201d Johnson said after his victory. \u201cAfter this convention, people will be looking to us to describe what it means to be a Libertarian. And I realize it will be up to me to tell them.",
        "Soccer star Alan Pulido was rescued late Sunday night by Mexican police following his kidnapping about 24 hours earlier in the northern Mexico border state of Tamaulipas, authorities said. Pulido, who had returned to his hometown of Ciudad Victoria after his season with Olympiakos of the Greek league ended, reportedly was taken by armed men outside a restaurant. Pulido\u2019s brother, Armando, confirmed the kidnapping to Medio Tiempo, saying the striker had disappeared as he and his girlfriend, Ileana Salas, left a party at around 11:30 p. m. Saturday and his car was surrounded by several trucks.",
        "When you rent a car this summer, don\u2019t look for one price. Look for three. There\u2019s the low rate you\u2019re quoted when you\u2019re shopping for wheels, the final and more expensive rate after all required taxes and fees have been added \u2014 and the real price. Yes, it\u2019s that complicated. Consider what happened when Brian Scios rented a car from Hertz in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. recently. He thought his \u201cfinal\u201d rate would be $150, but after his plane arrived late, the car rental company upped it to $550.",
        "BAKU, Azerbaijan \u2014 In the center of downtown, an unfinished hotel sits locked and empty, a ghostly shell completely dark at night except for the glowing white letters at its elegant, peak: TRUMP TOWER. Construction on the Trump International Hotel & Tower here in Azerbaijan\u2019s capital stopped last year when the country\u2019s economy crashed amid plummeting oil prices. The local owner and developer, facing potentially huge losses, is scrambling to renegotiate contracts and get the building open.",
        "MOUNT SHASTA, Calif. \u2014 It is a glorious day in Northern California, and Lewis Elbinger, a Bernie Sanders supporter, is feeling great \u2014 or, as he puts it, \u201chigh vibe. \u201d In the five decades since he first painted a white peace sign on his forehead, protested the Vietnam War and hitchhiked to India to become a monk, in fact, he has never felt more optimistic about the country than at this very moment. \u201cA consciousness is rising,\u201d he says. A case could be made that this is not exactly so in the sense that Elbinger means it.",
        "EDINBURGH, Scotland \u2014 When Scotland voted in an independence referendum in September 2014, nationalist leaders pitched it as a chance to break a bond. But less than two years after Scots opted to remain in the United Kingdom, the specter of secession again looms over the lush green expanse of the British isles. The trigger this time is another referendum with existential impact: next month\u2019s vote on whether to leave the European Union. If Britain chooses to ditch the E. U.",
        "There is no playbook for grief. But in 2010, when Amy Looney learned that her husband, Brendan, a Navy SEAL, had been killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan, she turned to someone who understood in a very specific way what she had lost. It was Ryan Manion Borek, the sister of her husband\u2019s best friend, who was killed by a sniper in Iraq in 2007. The two women met briefly at the funeral for Ryan\u2019s brother, Marine 1st Lt. Travis Manion. Now, at Brendan\u2019s funeral, Ryan looked at Amy and saw a reflection of herself.",
        "DIETRICH, Idaho \u2014 The first child they adopted was a from the Marshall Islands who had rotten teeth and a large abscess covering the side of his face. At the time, the family of Tim and Shelly McDaniel was still passably conventional in this town of 330, surrounded by high desert dotted with sagebrush and cattle. But since that first adoption in 2000, the couple have brought into their fold 19 more castaway kids from all over the country \u2014 most from troubled families, and half of them black.",
        "Hundreds of thousands of residents will face major disruptions to their daily commutes after Metro launches its maintenance blitz Saturday. But with less than a week to go before the first crews begin digging out of decades of neglect, much of the region \u2014 from officialdom to everyday commuters on packed trains, buses and roads \u2014 is not ready for what\u2019s coming. Despite a flurry of preparations, the sheer scale of potential impacts, the staggered schedule of the repairs and human nature have conspired to leave many fuzzy on the details."
