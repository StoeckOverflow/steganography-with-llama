        "The killing of an endangered gorilla at the Cincinnati Zoo to rescue a boy who fell into a dangerous enclosure unleashed an outpouring of grief on Saturday. Within hours, that grief had turned to fury as critics questioned the zoo\u2019s decision to kill the endangered gorilla, named Harambe, and called for the boy\u2019s parents to be punished for not adequately supervising their child. A Facebook page called \u201cJustice for Harambe\u201d received more than 41, 000 \u201clikes\u201d within hours of its creation.",
        "Sana Hamze knew it would be controversial when she asked The Citadel, the historic military college in South Carolina, for an exception to the uniform rule: She wanted to wear a hijab because of her faith. \u201cI knew it would be an uproar, just because of how Muslims are portrayed in the media now,\u201d she said. But she was surprised how soon word leaked out that an accepted student had requested a religious accommodation and how intense the reaction was.",
        "A desperate search for a Japanese boy who was intentionally abandoned in remote woods continued Tuesday as rescuers admitted that they have found no signs of the missing child. The search zone \u2014 a mountainous area near Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan\u2019s four main islands \u2014 is isolated, dense and home to wild bears, locals told the Japan Times. Fears about the child\u2019s safety intensified after rescuers found fresh bear droppings in the area, prompting two hunters to join the search party, according to Agence France Presse.",
        "NEW YORK Hillary Clinton has upended her campaign schedule, adding more stops in California, in an effort to prevent an embarrassing loss there to Bernie Sanders, her rival for the Democratic presidential nomination. Clinton originally planned to campaign for two days this week in New Jersey, but at the last minute canceled an event on Thursday and will instead return to California for a swing. The schedule change comes as Sanders has barnstormed California, not leaving the state in more than a week. Meanwhile, a recent poll found the race closing significantly.",
        "As a service to you, the reader, a surprisingly convincing argument that you may find useful to impress your friends at Memorial Day barbecues. At some point, Donald Trump needs to designate the person who will serve as his should he win the presidency this November. Predicting the person who will be tapped to serve as a candidate\u2019s vice president is always a tricky affair, thanks to the general opacity of the process. For Trump, there\u2019s an added layer of obscurity; the simple unpredictability of the guy coats the whole thing with another layer of thick black paint.",
        "BAGHDAD \u2014 Iraqi forces pushed into the southern edge of Fallujah on Monday, enduring car bombs and sniper fire from Islamic State fighters determined to hold onto the strategic western city. Lt. Gen. Abdulwahab commander of the government\u2019s offensive, said that forces from Iraq\u2019s army, police and elite Counterterrorism Service launched the assault on southern Fallujah early Monday. Since Prime Minister Haider announced the operation just over a week ago, government forces, together with Shiite militia troops and tribal fighters, mostly from Sunni Anbar province, have taken territory around Fallujah in preparation for an assault on its urban area.",
        "One of the nation\u2019s largest pension funds said that it is out of ideas for ways to save itself from an impending failure. After the Treasury Department rejected its Hail Mary proposal, which would have substantially cut benefits for some retirees, the Central States Pension Fund has little choice but to turn to a federal insurance program that is supposed to offer a lifeline to troubled pension funds. But there\u2019s one major problem \u2014 that program is expected to run out of money, too. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.",
        "Donald Trump on Tuesday announced he\u2019d given away the last $1. 5 million that other donors had entrusted to him four months earlier, when Trump held a televised benefit for veterans\u2019 charities. But, at the same time, Trump blasted the news media \u2014 in terms that were bitter, even for him \u2014 for asking about how, and when, he was going to give this money away.",
        "One of the charities that Donald Trump selected to receive a donation from his veterans\u2019 fundraiser is a group with a rating of \u201dF\u201d from CharityWatch, and has been criticized in the past for spending less than half of its incoming donations on programs that help veterans. The Foundation for American Veterans received a donation of $75, 000, Trump announced on Tuesday, as he gave away the last of $5. 6 million raised during a benefit Trump organized in January. During his combative press conference, Trump said that all of the groups had been scrutinized.",
        "Tuesday marks four weeks since Donald Trump won the Indiana Republican primary, forcing fellow presidential candidates Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich out of the race and earning him the mantle of presumptive Republican nominee. It also marked the beginning of a fascinating pas de deux between Trump and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) who declared two days later that he was \u201cnot ready\u201d to endorse the choice of his party\u2019s voters.",
        "Ed Asner is not wearing any pants. He is standing in the back room of a former dollar store in Columbia, Md. Taped by the door is a handwritten note on a blue piece of paper: \u201cEd\u2019s dressing room. \u201d Asner is staring into a mirror at his face, which is bisected by a fake mustache. On his script is an unlit cigarette. There\u2019s a small bowl of Werther\u2019s hard candy nearby. \u201cWho am I?\u201d he mutters.",
        "Teach for America has spent most of its 25 years working to expand, growing from a concept outlined in a Princeton student\u2019s honors thesis to an juggernaut that places thousands of idealistic college graduates in some of the nation\u2019s neediest classrooms. But that growth has stalled. Applications for TFA\u2019s teaching stints have plummeted 35 percent during the past three years, forcing the organization to reexamine and reinvent how it sells itself to prospective corps members. It has been focusing particularly on how to engage students at the nation\u2019s colleges, where the decline in interest has been among the steepest.",
        "What word comes to mind when you see the name Donald Trump? For some people, it might be \u201canger,\u201d since he provokes it and stokes it. For others, it might be \u201cignorance,\u201d since he knows so little and, like many unburdened by knowledge, is untroubled by facts. Some might say \u201cfear,\u201d since it would take some scary police tactics to push 11 million people over the border to Mexico. For me, none of those words suffices. I would say \u201cbetrayal.",
        "For those of us with a certain political bent and background, this is the most depressing moment of all. The best of the GOP \u2014 Marco Rubio and Paul Ryan, the intellectually serious reformicons who have called attention to issues of poverty and the need for Republican outreach \u2014 are bending their knee to the worst nominee in their party\u2019s history. Ryan drags himself slowly. Rubio eventually went with a quick pull. But the largest political choice each man has made this year will be one of the worst mistakes of their careers. How do I know this?",
        "Jonny McCoy didn\u2019t intend to practice criminal law. \u201cI wanted to be like Tom Cruise in \u2018The Firm,\u2019 \u201d says the Myrtle Beach, S. C. attorney. \u201cI was chasing all that company money. \u201d That all changed in October 2009 when he spotted three Columbia, S. C. police officers roughing up his friend Keith McAllister outside a bar in the trendy Five Points area.",
        "Donald Trump makes more guarantees than a salesman. I guarantee you. He guarantees Mexico will pay for the border wall. \u201cI\u2019ll get Mexico to pay for it one way or the other. I guarantee you that. \u201d He guarantees that his tax returns are the hugest ever. \u201cThey\u2019re very big tax returns,\u201d he said after the New Hampshire primary. \u201cI guarantee you this, the biggest ever in the history of what we\u2019re doing. . . . But we\u2019ll be releasing them.",
        "Donald Trump looked like a fool and a fraud on Sunday. But what else is new? Even the most ardent Trumpistas would have to admit that Trump\u2019s appearance at the annual Rolling Thunder motorcycle rally was, as spectacles go, pretty pathetic. It was supposed to be a vast, multitudinous gathering on the plaza in front of the Lincoln Memorial, one of the greatest and most historic public spaces in the nation. Instead, Trump drew a paltry crowd estimated by organizers at perhaps 5, 000.",
        "Fred V. Malek is of Thayer Lodging Group and finance chairman of the Republican Governors Association. Republicans across the country were stunned last week when Donald Trump lashed out at Gov. Susana Martinez during a campaign stop in her home state of New Mexico, and rightly so. As the party of Lincoln, Republicans have two governors of Hispanic descent and three highly respected female governors. Trump needs to court and gain the support of leaders like these, who represent the strength, competence and diversity of the GOP \u2014 not attack them.",
        "The FBI wants to exempt its burgeoning national database of fingerprints and facial photos from a federal law that gives Americans the right to sue for government violations of the Privacy Act, such as refusing to tell a person if he or she is in the system. The bureau also wants to shield its data storehouse from other Privacy Act rules, including one that lets people ensure that the information the government holds about them is accurate. The proposed exemptions, published in May in the Federal Register, have stirred objections from an array of privacy and civil rights advocates.",
        "A federal appeals court that sided with a transgender teen in his lawsuit against a Virginia school board has denied the board\u2019s request to rehear the case before a full panel of judges. The Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit ruled in April that a lawsuit filed by transgender teen Gavin Grimm, who sued the Gloucester County School Board after it passed a policy banning him from the boy\u2019s bathroom, could move forward.",
        "Many slain journalists in the Philippines had been corrupt and had \u201ddone something\u201d to warrant being killed, the country\u2019s said. \u201dJust because you\u2019re a journalist you are not exempted from assassination if you\u2019re a son of a bitch,\u201d Rodrigo Duterte said Tuesday, Agence reported. The brash, former mayor, who will be sworn in as president on June 30, was responding to a question about how he would handle the killing of journalists. He has previously attracted international outrage for his comments, including remarks about the rape and killing of an Australian missionary in 1989.",
        "For the bajillionth time in this campaign, Bernie Sanders was asked over the weekend about the ongoing FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s decision to exclusively use a private email server during her time as secretary of state. And, for the bajillionth time, Sanders took a hard pass on the question. Here\u2019s the exchange with \u201cMeet the Press\u201d host Chuck Todd: CHUCK TODD: Do you think Hillary Clinton needs a clean bill of health from the FBI before she accepts the Democrat nomination?",
        "A week ago, Katie Couric was scolding the media for \u201denabling\u201d Donald Trump. The former \u201dToday\u201d and \u201dCBS Evening News\u201d anchor was particularly critical of TV networks\u2019 willingness to conduct phone interviews with Trump, instead of insisting that he appear on camera. \u201dI thought it was very difficult to ask him challenging questions on the phone because he was like a bulldozer,\u201d Couric, now the global anchor for Yahoo News, told CNN\u2019s David Axelrod on his \u201dAxe Files\u201d podcast.",
        "The potential for the 2016 election to widen America\u2019s racial voting chasm even further is nothing new. But Washington News polls have also identified a related dynamic: White Americans are splintering along education and gender lines at rates not seen in at least three decades. These contours are among political watchers; whites without college degrees and men tend to be more Republican than women and college grads. But while these cleavages are seen across elections, it\u2019s easy to forget that the gaps are typically not all that large \u2014 at least in comparison to this year. Take 2012.",
        "Brett Sanders didn\u2019t just get mad. He got even \u2014 to the penny. Sanders, who lives in Frisco, Texas, tried to beat a traffic ticket and lost. So when it came time to pay the $222. 60 fine, he paid in cash. Two buckets full of pennies, to be exact. He dumped them on the counter of the municipal court clerk\u2019s office. To judge from the video he posted, it was like someone hitting the jackpot, except a lot less fun. \u201cYa\u2019ll can mail me the receipt too,\u201d Sanders tells the clerk. And then he leaves.",
        "By her Diana Rodriguez had envisioned a life free of kids. She\u2019d had hers early; two sons were grown and married, and her daughter was in college. \u201cI was kind of looking forward to having an empty nest, because when you have your children so young, you never had a chance to explore life and not have those responsibilities,\u201d said Rodriguez, 54. Instead, her sons\u2019 marriages broke up and they moved back in \u2014 one for two years, the other for eight months \u2014 to the Alexandria, Va. house she shares with her husband, who is not their father.",
        "The Washington food scene\u2019s decade of dramatic transformation has brought us artisanal toast, $22 cocktails and numerous accolades. Now, the city\u2019s foodscape will be recognized by one of the world\u2019s highest arbiters of culinary taste: the Michelin Guide. Michelin announced Tuesday that it has already deployed its famously anonymous inspectors throughout Washington restaurants \u2014 news sure to strike fear in the hearts of chefs and servers \u2014 in anticipation of the city\u2019s first Michelin Guide, which will go on sale Oct. 13.

        "A day after Johnny Depp\u2019s friend wrote an online column slamming his estranged wife Amber Heard as a \u201cmanipulative [expletive]\u201d intent on spreading lies about Depp, the actress\u2019s lawyers have released a statement Tuesday saying she \u201csuffered through years of physical and psychological abuse\u201d from the actor, and blasted the \u201cvicious false and malicious allegations that have infected the media. \u201d [Amber Heard files a restraining order against Johnny Depp after alleged domestic abuse] Heard, 30, who filed for divorce from Depp last week, accused the actor of repeated domestic violence.",
        "Even as Sen. Bernie Sanders continues to insist he can win the Democratic nomination, several prominent liberals have lined up behind Hillary Clinton in recent days \u2014 signaling that the time is now to begin unifying the party to take on Republican Donald Trump. In endorsements of Clinton this week, California Gov. Jerry Brown and an influential environmental group, the NRDC Action Fund, argued that Democrats must stop fighting one another over their party\u2019s nomination.",
        "On Fox News Channel on Tuesday night, host Sean Hannity interviewed Donald Trump. Hannity asked Trump about a bitter news conference that the presumptive Republican nominee had given earlier in the day, when Trump announced donations to veterans groups, using money he had raised four months earlier in Iowa. Trump had also blasted the news media for pressing him to explain what he\u2019d done with the money. On air, Hannity was sympathetic. He told Trump that he\u2019d be voting for him in November. And Hannity seemed to echo Trump\u2019s criticism of the news media\u2019s questions."
