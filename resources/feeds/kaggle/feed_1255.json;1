        "The Donald golf course in Miami that has hosted a storied professional golf tournament for the past 55 years lost that event Wednesday when the PGA Tour announced it was moving its elite World Golf Championship out of South Florida. Beginning in 2017, the tournament will be played instead in \u2014 of all places \u2014 Mexico City.",
        "The mystery that for weeks unnerved this quiet Capitol Hill neighborhood began with a warning placed on a nanny\u2019s windshield. \u201cI know you are misusing this visitor pass to park here daily,\u201d the April 4 note read. \u201cIf you do not stop I will report it, have your car towed and the resident who provided this to you will have his privileges taken away. \u201d Baffled, the young couple the nanny worked for sent out a message on the community email group asking for the note\u2019s anonymous author to contact them. No one came forward.",
        "The government siege of a Damascus suburb was broken Wednesday with delivery of medical supplies and a small amount of baby food, after Syria agreed to allow an international aid convoy to enter the area for the first time since 2012. Arrival of United Nations and Red Cross vehicles in the city of Darayya came just hours into a June 1 deadline, after which the United States and Russia had pledged to organize airdrops for food and medicine to reach starving civilians. Although U. S.",
        "Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States, is founder of the nonprofit Carter Center. It is disturbing that some human rights and public health organizations are advocating the full legalization of the sex trade, including its most abusive aspects. I agree with Amnesty International, UNAIDS and other groups that say that those who sell sex acts should not be arrested or prosecuted, but I cannot support proposals to decriminalize buyers and pimps. Some assert that this \u201cprofession\u201d can be empowering and that legalizing and regulating all aspects of prostitution will mitigate the harm that accompanies it.",
        "OXFORD, Md. It was such a marvelous idea: the United States of America. Obviously, we\u2019ve never really pulled it all together under one hat, but it has always seemed that at least we were striving for a more perfect union. No more. Something changed \u2014 and quickly, as history goes. Actually, everything did. Massive immigration has changed the face of the nation in more than metaphorical ways. Globalization has made us seem or at least feel less unique among nations. Our hyperpartisanship, augmented by incessant media coverage tied to ratings and greed, has reduced politics to a brawl.",
        "How can I make such a bold assertion before she has even received the nomination? Because I already did, several months ago, when it was harder, before a single primary or caucus vote had been cast. And yes, I got the Trump part right too. The air was dense back before Iowa with tales of Jeb, and Rubio and all the rest at the adult and children\u2019s tables. Trump would never be the nominee. A colleague had to literally eat his column predicting that Trump would never win the nomination. It just couldn\u2019t happen. Until it did.",
        "Hong Kong television commentator Wu Jun observed recently that despite Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric, he \u201ccould in fact be the best president for China. \u201d The Chinese analyst is right: A Trump presidency could open the way for China\u2019s strategic dominance in Asia and elsewhere. Wu\u2019s comment was focused on Trump\u2019s mercantilist style, evoking a world in which Trump and President Xi Jinping, two \u201cbig guys,\u201d might sit around a table at and cut deals without worrying about human rights.",
        "Lori Gruen is a philosophy professor and the coordinator of animal studies at Wesleyan University and was editor of the anthology \u201cThe Ethics of Captivity. \u201d The death of Harambe, the endangered lowland gorilla shot at the Cincinnati Zoo after a crawled through a barrier and fell into his enclosure, was a deeply traumatizing event \u2014 for the child, for the surviving gorillas, for the witnesses, for the animal care staff and for those of us sensitive to the plight of captive animals.",
        "The State Department acknowledged Wednesday that someone in its public affairs bureau made a \u201cdeliberate\u201d request that several minutes of tape be cut from the video of a 2013 press briefing in which a reporter asked if the administration had lied about secret talks with Iran. The embarrassing admission by State Department spokesman John Kirby came three weeks after another spokesperson insisted that a \u201cglitch\u201d had caused the gap, discovered only last month by the reporter whose questioning had mysteriously disappeared. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a technical glitch, this was a deliberate step to excise the video,\u201d Kirby told reporters.",

Levine, 58, is the highest ranking transgender official in Pennsylvania and one of only a handful serving in elected or appointed offices nationwide.",
        "Kenneth Starr, demoted last week from his position as president of Baylor University, also will step down as chancellor of the Christian school in Texas, ESPN reported Wednesday. The revelation about Starr comes amid a leadership shakeup as Baylor confronts the fallout from a scathing report on its handling of sexual assault cases involving football players and others. Starr told ESPN\u2019s Joe Schad that he was resigning as chancellor effective immediately \u201cas a matter of conscience.",

        "Donald Trump was personally involved in devising the marketing strategy for Trump University, even vetting potential ads, according to newly disclosed sworn testimony from the company\u2019s top executive taken as part of an ongoing lawsuit. In the testimony, part of a trove of records made public as a result of a federal judge\u2019s Friday order, the executive said that the real estate mogul was involved in discussions and signed off \u201cany time we had a new ad. \u201d \u201cMr.",
        "A rise in bisexuality is driving a sharp increase in experiences in the United States, according to a new study \u2014 and Americans are increasingly open to the shift. Using data from the General Social Survey (GSS) a nationally representative survey of U. S. adults conducted since 1972 including a total of 33, 728 participants, a team of social scientists found that the percentage of men reporting male sexual partners had nearly doubled from 1990 to 2014, and the percentage of women reporting experiences had more than doubled during the same period.",
        "Days after a young boy fell into the gorilla exhibit at the Cincinnati zoo \u2014 prompting the zoo\u2019s decision to shoot and kill a gorilla \u2014 archived video has emerged showing a similar incident 20 years ago, with a very different outcome. In summer 1996, a rambunctious boy slipped away from his mother and squeezed through a barrier at the Brookfield Zoo in Illinois, plummeting more than 15 feet into a pit holding several gorillas. One of them scooped up the toddler, cradled him, carried him to paramedics \u2014 and gained international fame.",
        "Patient Care Bay (dewar being filled with liquid nitrogen) Alcor Life Extension Foundation, Phoenix, October 2006. (\u201cThe Prospect of Immortality\u201d by Murray Ballard, published by GOST.) Since the beginning of time, humankind has been fascinated with the idea of what happens to us after we die. We deal with the question in innumerable ways, including through philosophy and religion. We also explore the idea through books, movies and music. Driven by the thought that it might be possible to live forever, some people have tried to figure out how to accomplish that.",
        "SAN DIEGO \u2014 Hillary Clinton lacerated Donald Trump in a foreign policy speech Thursday, effectively launching her general election campaign by declaring him \u201ctemperamentally unfit\u201d to lead the most powerful nation in the world. In an address that signaled clearly how she plans to defeat Trump in November, Clinton did not delve into the details of her own policies but focused instead on how she views his shortcomings. She framed the real estate magnate with contempt and mockery, and she rejected the central tenet of his campaign: that America is no longer great.",
        "House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) ended a holdout by formally backing his party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee: Donald Trump. On Thursday, the speaker penned a guest column for his hometown newspaper in which he trumpeted the controversial mogul as someone who could support the speaker\u2019s conservative agenda. The move consolidated Trump\u2019s backing from Republican congressional leaders and most party leaders, leaving a bloc of conservatives who have vowed to never support the mogul isolated and without a significant leader carrying their flag.",
        "Hispanic Republicans and conservatives are increasingly anguished over whether they can remain involved in this year\u2019s presidential election as Donald Trump continues to launch attacks on prominent Latinos and makes little effort to win their support. Many Hispanics active in national GOP politics have been hoping for months that Trump would tone down his broadsides against immigrants and begin delivering a more welcoming, accepting message to minorities. But amid fresh attacks by Trump on Hispanic figures, there is little evidence that such a change is coming \u2014 leading some to abandon the presidential race or the 2016 elections altogether.",
        "About 15 minutes into a newly released documentary about her husband\u2019s train wreck of a campaign for New York City mayor, Huma Abedin reflects on the awkward improbability of it all. \u201cThose of you who know me are probably surprised to see me standing up here. I\u2019m usually back of the room, far away from the microphone as possible,\u201d she tells an audience of women in a swanky Manhattan apartment where she has come to raise money for Anthony Weiner\u2019s mayoral bid. Abedin, of course, is the famously private aide de camp, confidante and surrogate daughter to Hillary Clinton.",
        "For the first time since the recession ended, America\u2019s job market has been firing on all cylinders: Workers have been finding more jobs, making more money and spending more of their paychecks. So far this year, the economy has added an average of 192, 000 jobs a month, a healthy pace that has renewed hope of finding employment for many workers. Those who already have jobs are enjoying the fastest wage growth since the recovery began. And that is helping to give households the confidence to spend their money, fueling the biggest spike in purchases in seven years.",
        "AS DONALD Trump was building a campaign on lies, bigotry, insults, fearmongering and unreason, a few Republican leaders of apparent principle offered some resistance. Foremost among them was House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( . ). In March, Mr. Ryan insisted that \u201call of us as leaders can hold ourselves to the highest standards of integrity and decency\u201d and that \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t accept ugliness as the norm. \u201d On Thursday Mr. Ryan capitulated to ugliness.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: A new analysis published this morning by FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Dave Wasserman casts still more doubt on one of the most cherished narratives of the 2016 cycle: That Donald Trump might, just might, be able to surprise all of us and win the White House by activating millions of missing white voters with his bluster, bigotry, and all around bigness. Wasserman\u2019s analysis looks at this question in a new way: He asks what might happen if Trump actually did succeed in activating these missing white voters.",
        "So in just this week alone, we\u2019ve had quite the window into Donald Trump\u2019s financial and business practices: Trump finally fulfilled his earlier public pledges to donate money to veterans\u2019 groups, but only after the staff here at The Post tried to figure out if he actually had. He groused a lot about having to fulfill that promise, too. We\u2019ve seen how the operation was over at the Trump University. A bona fide billionaire questioned whether Trump was really worth all that much.",

It\u2019s almost a matter of style. Who can be afraid of a candidate so irascible, grumpy, and unfashionable? After all, he\u2019s not going to win the nomination, so what harm can he do? A major address at the party convention? A say in the vice presidential selection? And who reads party platforms anyway? Well, platforms may not immediately affect a particular campaign.",

        "The company Airbnb, facing increasing complaints of racial bias, says it\u2019s planning a \u201dcomprehensive review\u201d of how discrimination may arise on a platform that has given private citizens the power to rent their homes \u2014 and pick their guests \u2014 over the Internet. A widely cited Harvard Business School study last year found \u201dwidespread discrimination\u201d by Airbnb hosts who were less likely to accept bookings from guests whose names sounded distinctly black."
