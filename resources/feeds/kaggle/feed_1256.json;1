        "Three weeks ago, 130 scientists, entrepreneurs and policy leaders held an meeting at Harvard University to discuss an ambitious plan to create synthetic human genomes. Now, after a flurry of criticism over the secrecy of the effort, the participants have published their idea, declaring that they\u2019re launching a project to radically reduce the cost of synthesizing genomes a potentially revolutionary development in biotechnology that could enable technicians to grow human organs for transplantation. The proposal, published Thursday in the journal Science, is the latest sign that biotechnology is going through a rapidly advancing but ethically fraught period.",
        "Prince died from an accidental overdose of a powerful opioid, according to autopsy results released Thursday. The Midwest Medical Examiner\u2019s Office report lists the cause of death as an accident, the result of the drug fentanyl. Fentanyl is a synthetic opiate that\u2019s more powerful than morphine, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. \u201cIt is typically used to treat patients with severe pain, or to manage pain after surgery,\u201d according to the NIDA. \u201cIt is also sometimes used to treat people with chronic pain who are physically tolerant to opiates.",
        "Bryan Whitman, the senior Pentagon official charged with stealing a Capitol Hill nanny\u2019s license plates, was placed on paid administrative leave Thursday and had his security clearance revoked. It remains unclear whether Whitman, the career civilian in the Defense Department\u2019s public affairs office, had informed his superiors of the alleged crimes \u2014 which he was required to do. The Pentagon\u2019s top public affairs officials were stunned by the news Wednesday that he had been charged nearly a month ago. Whitman did not immediately respond to a call Thursday morning, and his attorney declined to comment.",
        "\u201cLiterally eight months before the first ballot was cast in Iowa, she had almost all of the superdelegates on board. That is an absurd system. \u2026 Now, on Tuesday night, on the 7th, you are going to hear from media saying that Hillary Clinton has received 80 or 90 delegates from New Jersey and other states \u2026 the nominating process is over, Secretary Clinton has won. That is factually incorrect. That is just not factually correct. \u201d \u2014 Sen. Bernie Sanders, speech in Santa Cruz, Calif.",
        "The first known published description of Donald Trump\u2019s hair, as an entity that deserved its own description, was mild. \u201cHis sandy hair is probably a bit long by standards of the corporate world,\u201d read a 1984 newspaper profile of the mogul. \u201cWith the sides slicked back just a bit. \u201d Three decades later, describing the headstuff of the leading Republican presidential candidate has been elevated to an art form. Is is swirled or swooped? Animal or vegetable? (Mineral?) Burnt sienna or orange Creamsicle?",
        "There are reasons to be skeptical that the wall on the border would ever be built. Putting a ban on Muslims entering the country seems neither practical nor constitutional. But Donald Trump has finally made one campaign promise that voters may be able to count on. \u201cI\u2019m not changing,\u201d he declared this week. Indeed, it is the rest of the political world that is having to adjust. If recent days are any indication, the remaining five months of this presidential campaign are likely to be fought entirely on Trump\u2019s terms.",
        "Democrats and Hispanic activists said Friday that they are increasingly alarmed by a spate of violence at Donald Trump rallies instigated by protesters, fearing that the incidents \u2014 widely viewed on television and social media \u2014 will only help the GOP candidate and undermine their attempts to defeat him. The latest flash point came Thursday in downtown San Jose, where a demonstration outside a Trump campaign rally quickly escalated out of control. Several protesters assaulted Trump supporters, ripped signs away from them and stomped on vehicles in the area.",
        "CHICO, Calif. \u2014 Bernie Sanders first touched down in California 10 months ago, and close to 28, 000 people filled the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena to see him. Just two staffers made the trip. There was something dreamlike about the crowd, and something promising, too. \u201cBy December, when we were looking down the road, California stuck out as a place to compete,\u201d said Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, in an interview. Today, Sanders travels around California in a caravan of SUVs and campaign buses.",
        "About five hours before the first pitch one day this week, the Atlantic League\u2019s leading hitter walked into the modest home clubhouse at Regency Furniture Stadium. Some teammates had recently lunched on Burger King and Subway \u2014 \u201canyone need anything from the store: Walmart, Costco?\u201d someone shouted out \u2014 but Steve Lombardozzi brought his meal in tupperware: chicken with pasta.",
        "KARACHI, Pakistan \u2014 Five years after most senior leaders are thought to have fled this port city, officials in Karachi worry that the organization is regrouping and finding new support here and in neighboring Afghanistan. They are especially concerned about the recruitment of potential foot soldiers for the next major terrorist attack. The resurgence has been managed by a South Asian offshoot called in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) created by \u2019s top leader, Ayman in 2014 in order to slow advances by rival Islamic State militants in the region.",
        "Given the city\u2019s unmet human needs and deteriorating physical infrastructure, and Metro\u2019s massive and disruptive rebuilding project, why, in the name of all that is sensible, is the D.

Here\u2019s betting that most D. C.",
        "On Thursday, Donald Trump escalated his racist attacks on Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge hearing one of the fraud cases against Trump University. The presumptive Republican nominee had already called the judge a \u201cMexican\u201d \u2014 the Latino jurist was born in Indiana \u2014 and floated the allegation that Curiel\u2019s ethnicity biases him against Trump because of the candidate\u2019s immigration stance. Trump had threatened to use the power of the presidency against the judge, saying \u201cwe will come back in November\u201d and people \u201cought to look into\u201d the judge.",
        "LONDON Misery loves company, so refugees from America\u2019s Republican Party should understand that theirs is not the only party that has chosen a leader who confirms caricatures of it while repudiating its purposes. Jeremy Corbyn, the silliest leader in the British Labour Party\u2019s history, might kill satire as well as whatever remains of socialism. Labour was founded in 1900 to demonstrate that a political prophet was mistaken. Karl Marx had proclaimed that meaningful amelioration of conditions could not be achieved by parliamentary means. Labour helped make modern Britain into a mostly generally temperate nation impervious to exotic politics.",

She\u2019s only a year younger, but I fell asleep at the wheel on the Beltway a few years ago, denting the car alongside me. I don\u2019t bother arguing about our relative competence. Someday our three children, one of whom lives with us in Pasadena, Calif. and regularly witnesses our driving, will sit us down and have the conversation nearly everyone our age fears.",

Consider the persistent to the status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac known as \u201crecap and release. \u201d The plan is to return the two giants to their status as privately owned but \u201c \u201d enterprises. That is to say, to recreate the conflict that helped sink them in the first place. Their income would recapitalize the entities, rather than be funneled to the treasury, as is currently the case.",
        "CHICAGO \u2014 Officials here released a huge array of videos and police reports Friday from about 100 open investigations into police shootings and use of force, a sharp reversal in a city still reeling from the impact of footage showing an officer fatally shooting a teenager. As the city\u2019s police department faces intense scrutiny and a looming Justice Department investigation, authorities promising reform and increased transparency said they were releasing the trove to try and restore trust between officers and the community.",
        "(Karen via Getty Images) There are certain months when you should close your eyes, click your heels together three times, and think to yourself: The jobs report has a margin of error of 100, 000 jobs. The jobs report has a margin of error of 100, 000 jobs. The jobs report has a margin of error of 100, 000 jobs. This is one of those months. The good news was bad and the bad news was worse, so our only consolation is that this might be a blip. Consider this: The unemployment rate ticked down from 5.",

        "Van Terry stepped to the podium and tried to contain the emotions simmering inside him. Behind him, in a bright orange jumpsuit, sat Michael Madison, the man convicted of brutally murdering Terry\u2019s teenage daughter. In front of Terry sat Nancy McDonnell, the Ohio county judge who would decide whether Madison deserved to die for his crimes. \u201cRight now, I guess in our hearts we\u2019re supposed to forgive this clown,\u201d he said, looking forward, toward the judge, then back, toward the murderer. \u201cWho has touched our families, taken my child. \u201d He paused.",
        "The Yellowstone National Park tourists who loaded a baby bison into the back of an SUV last month say they thought the calf was already abandoned and believed they were doing a \u201cnice thing\u201d for the animal, which was later euthanized. \u201cIt was the way it was presented (in news coverage) it was like we didn\u2019t know what we were doing,\u201d one of the men, Shamash Kassam, told ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d in an interview that aired Friday.",
        "When you see the video of the guy taunting police by stunting on his ATV in front of a cop car, you understand why police officers might be tempted to chase him down. In the old days \u2014 when I was a teenager, for example \u2014 there was an unwritten code of the road: If you ran from the police, the police would chase you. It\u2019s the impulse to settle matters in the street, which is very much part of the reptilian brain that\u2019s sometimes awash with raw adrenaline. D. C.",
        "It s the third of June. Somewhere in Mississippi, it s another sleepy, dusty delta day. Since the summer of 1967, when the Southern gothic ballad Ode to Billie Joe, ? set on this day in that place, first hit the airwaves, the song has captivated American pop culture in a way few ever have. Written and sung by an unknown young woman from Mississippi named Bobbie Gentry, it was an eerie, mystery about an unnamed young woman and her family sitting around a farm dinner table discussing, in elliptical terms, the suicide of Billie Joe McAllister.",
        "Bernie Sanders held a news conference \u2014 good for him! \u2014 on Thursday during a campaign swing in California. He started off, according to The Post\u2019s David Weigel, with a series of remarks about climate change and the dangers it posed to the world. Then he opened things up to questions from reporters \u2014 sort of. \u201dAny questions from the media on climate change?\u201d Sanders asked. \u201dGot one on climate change? Not on the last poll?\u201d If you had a question on climate change, Sanders would take it. If you didn\u2019t, he wouldn\u2019t.",
        "We have generally learned that there\u2019s not much utility in every tweet that springs to life from the imagination of Donald Trump or which receives his blessing via retweet. Tweets containing factual errors are not as plentiful as those containing exclamation points or disparagement, but they aren\u2019t exactly rare. But on Thursday evening, Trump retweeted this one, and we well, I couldn\u2019t let it stand. \u201d@TaylorEdwards99: THIS IS @POTUS\u2019S LEGACY! AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER! !!

        "WICHITA \u2014 In the years after he graduated from MIT, long before he became the of liberals, Charles Koch read a lot of Karl Marx. By day he was a consultant, telling companies like Exxon and DuPont how to manage their workers. By night he binged on philosophy and economic theory: Aristotle and Descartes; John Maynard Keynes and Friedrich Hayek; even the giants of communism, Lenin, Mao and Marx. The readings tickled Koch\u2019s fondness for principles and order, and they steered him deep into a structured, almost numeric, view of how human society functions.",
        "Mass incarceration in America is an epidemic \u2014 not just in terms of being widespread, but in the medical sense, too. Health policy expert Ernest Drucker argues in his book \u201cA Plague of Prisons\u201d that incarceration behaves much like a disease. As in an epidemic, there is a root to the outbreak. Proximity increases chances of infection. There are common patterns of transmission. It leaves indelible scars on the incarcerated and their loved ones. The system of incarceration doesn\u2019t simply affect the person in the cell. It can poison families and their surrounding communities.",
        "Time zone by time zone, the people of the world awoke Saturday to the cold realization that it would be the first day in 74 years without Muhammad Ali in their midst. Though it could not have been a surprise, the great heavyweight champion\u2019s death Friday night of complications from Parkinson\u2019s disease left a massive void, one that people famous and common tried to fill with words. In many cases, words failed. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to live in a world without Muhammad Ali,\u201d boxer George Foreman said of his former adversary. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible.",
        "Has there ever been an athlete more beautiful than Muhammad Ali? The quick, bouncing footwork, the smooth twist of his waist, the whip of his jabs: With a body by Michelangelo, the world\u2019s greatest boxer was a paragon of grace. Ali put his opponents in pain, gleefully goading Joe Frazier to fuel one of the greatest rivalries in all of sports. In his prime fighting years, he was the opposite of humble. He was, after all, a heavyweight.",
        "Muhammad Ali, the charismatic heavyweight boxing champion of the world, who declared himself \u201cthe greatest\u201d and proved it with his fists, the force of his personality and his magnetic charisma, and who transcended the world of sports to become a symbol of the antiwar movement of the 1960s and a global ambassador for understanding, died June 3 at a hospital in Scottsdale, Ariz. where he was living. He was 74. A family spokesman said the immediate cause of death was septic shock."
