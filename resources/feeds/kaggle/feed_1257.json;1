        "In one of the most indelible and stirring of Olympic images, Muhammad Ali, suffering then from Parkinson\u2019s Disease, lit the flame during the Opening Ceremonies for the 1996 Games in Atlanta. The poignant moment featuring Ali, a boxing gold medalist in the 1960 Games in Rome, almost didn\u2019t happen, though. Dick Ebersol, a former NBC executive, told Sports Business Journal\u2019s John Ourand that there was pressure from Billy Payne, the head of Atlanta\u2019s Olympic organizing committee, to go with Evander Holyfield instead. Ebersol firmly believed that the only choice was Ali.",
        "When Donald Trump introduced his new university from the lobby of his famous tower, he declared that it would be unlike any of his other ventures. Trump University would be a noble endeavor, he said, with an emphasis on education over profits. It was a way for him to give back, to share his expertise with the masses, to build a \u201clegacy as an educator. \u201d He wouldn\u2019t even keep all the money \u2014 if he happened to make a profit, he would turn the funds over to charity.",
        "It\u2019s been almost five weeks since Donald Trump\u2019s victory in Indiana made him the presumptive Republican nominee. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happened since: He\u2019s wasted time, proved to be a sore winner and veered sharply off message. He\u2019s put a higher premium on settling scores than finding a script that will appeal to a wider, audience. Will it cost him? Trump no doubt takes comfort in national polls that show a close contest against Hillary Clinton. Over the past month, her lead has shrunk dramatically.",
        "Colby Coash can point to the moment his evolution in thinking about the death penalty began. It was Sept. 3, 1994, and Coash \u2014 now a conservative senator in the Nebraska legislature but then a freshman at the University of \u2014 decided to go with some friends to the state penitentiary. Willie Otey, convicted of murder, was set to be executed at midnight, and people were gathering in the parking lot outside.",
        "Aaron David Miller is a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington. He served in the State Department from 1978 to 2003. Israel wanted no part in it. And neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians were scheduled to attend. Yet Secretary of State John Kerry remained optimistic ahead of Friday\u2019s Middle East peace conference in Paris. \u201cWhat we are seeking to do,\u201d he said, \u201cis encourage the parties to be able to see a way forward so they understand peace is a possibility.",
        "Looking around the blogosphere in the past few years, there has seemed to be a massive crisis of conscience among young, female and generally white women who consider themselves feminist . . . except. One writer wonders, \u201cDoes waxing make me a bad feminist?\u201d Another asks, \u201cCan a feminist wear high heels? \u201dAnother: \u201cCan a beauty editor be a feminist?\u201d And still another: \u201cI\u2019m engaged and it makes me feel like a bad feminist.",
        "Everything about gentrification is controversial \u2014 even its definition. One recent study by sociologist Michael Barton compared how the New York Times and researchers used the term to talk about city neighborhoods; he found very little agreement about where change was happening. That\u2019s not the only thing we can\u2019t agree on. Gentrification is painted alternately as a destroyer of neighborhoods or a savior of cities. These competing views are driven in part by misconceptions about what the word means and what it entails. Here are some of the most common. 1. Gentrification leads to lower crime.",
        "Caitlin Flanagan is the author of \u201cTo Hell With All That\u201d and \u201cGirl Land. \u201d She is a contributing editor at the Atlantic. In 2003, journalist Chris Hedges published a book with a simple title and fathomless moral implications: \u201cWhat Every Person Should Know About War. \u201d To begin reading the book \u2014 arranged as a series of simply stated questions and their spare, emotionally unweighted answers \u2014 was to be implicated by it.",
        "PARIS \u2014 A tall, fresh, commanding star blossomed in Paris on Saturday afternoon, with a fearlessness that hinted she can wear her stardom comfortably. Garbine Muguruza, born in Caracas in 1993 to a Venezuelan mother and a Spanish father, not only reprised her distinct lack of intimidation at the sight of Serena Williams across a tennis net. She seemed to have trained her brain to shoo toxic thoughts, a promising knack at 22.",
        "She\u2019s known in local newspapers as \u201cEmily Doe\u201d \u2014 a pseudonym to protect her privacy amid an emotional court battle in which former Stanford University varsity swimmer Brock Allen Turner was found guilty for her sexual assault. Prosecutors said that in January 2015, witnesses saw Turner sexually assaulting an unconscious woman behind a dumpster on campus.",
        "VATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis on Saturday scrapped his proposed tribunal to prosecute bishops who covered up for pedophile priests and instead laid out legal procedures to remove them if the Vatican finds they were negligent. The new procedures sought to answer demands by survivors of abuse that the Vatican hold bishops accountable for botching abuse cases. Victims have long accused bishops of covering up for pedophiles, moving rapists from parish to parish rather than reporting them to police \u2014 and suffering no consequences.",
        "A Florida man buried his boss nearly in dirt during an argument at a construction site that ended in serious injuries, according to police. Erick Cox, 32, was arrested for aggravated assault on Wednesday. Cox, who goes by the nickname \u201cPork Chop,\u201d was released from Volusia County jail on a $5, 000 bond, the Orlando Sentinel reported. \u201cHe ran him over and covered him up with dirt! Send somebody out there, please,\u201d a 911 caller told a dispatcher, reported.",
        "There\u2019s persistent . .. and then there\u2019s Jake Tapper. The CNN anchor posed the following question to Donald Trump on Friday: Let me ask you about comments you made about the judge in the Trump University case. You said that you thought it was a conflict of interest that he was the judge because he is of Mexican heritage, even though he is from Indiana. Hillary Clinton said that that is a racist attack on a federal judge. Actually, Tapper didn\u2019t quite get to form a question. Trump interjected to talk about Clinton\u2019s emails.",
        "There\u2019s no way around it. The Club for Growth the economically conservative, influential tea group that\u2019s known for propping up challengers to centrist Republican incumbents has already lost this presidential race. The Club was vehemently against Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy. They spent millions this Republican primary warning voters across the country that Trump is no fiscal conservative. Now that Trump is Republican\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, the Club isn\u2019t necessarily on board with him but they\u2019re not actively trying to take him down either.",
        "HOLLY SPRINGS, N. C. \u2014 In six short years, Renee Ellmers has gone from tea party darling to enemy. Elected in the 2010 conservative wave in which Republicans recaptured the House majority, the North Carolina congresswoman now finds herself in jeopardy from another GOP lawmaker \u2014 George Holding \u2014 who outside groups believe is the truer conservative. And their aggressive campaign to take down Ellmers, a former nurse who entered politics because of her anger at Obamacare, may just be successful.",
        "In recent years, climate scientists have grown increasingly concerned about a carbon problem in the far north. The fear is that with the higher latitudes of the planet warming extremely rapidly, that heat itself, and some of its consequences \u2014 such as raging wildfires in northern forests \u2014 could unleash a climate disaster. Perennially frozen northern soils, known as permafrost, contain enormous amounts of carbon because the slow and cold chemistry of the Arctic makes them the repository of thousands of years of frozen plant remains.",
        "According to a poll from the National Alliance for Youth Sports, around 70 percent of kids in the United States stop playing organized sports by the age of 13 because \u201cit\u2019s just not fun anymore. \u201d I have three kids, all of whom play sports, and my oldest is about to turn 13. I may not have understood why this was happening a few years ago, but sadly, knowing what I know now, the mass exodus of from organized sports makes perfect sense to me.",
        "A year ago, was born. In that time, I\u2019ve had the pleasure and the challenge of editing and writing blog posts about the experience of being single, dating, finding love and losing it, making friends and losing them, living alone, and more.

        "Have you ever pulled out a cutting board and sighed? Ever wished you could skip the chopping and go straight to the cooking? After 26 cookbooks, even the two of us can find knife work a hassle at the end of a busy day. Perhaps you haven\u2019t taken that knife skills class on your list, or maybe you haven\u2019t gotten around to buying good knives. Maybe your ability to chop just isn\u2019t what it once was.",
        "We can all agree it was horrendous. From the perspective of knowing a beautiful, endangered creature was killed. And watching a small child be flung around like a toy, possibly about to be crushed in front of zoo visitors and his own mother. Apparently, we can\u2019t all agree that our kids sometimes are kids and climb over fences they aren\u2019t supposed to. And sometimes parents are parents and don\u2019t see when they do. And yet, here we are: People are threatening the mother of this child, have started a change.",
        "A growing number of Republican lawmakers and strategists fear that Donald Trump\u2019s hostile remarks about minorities and his un or tho dox strategy have imperiled his campaign at the end of a head start on Democratic Hillary Clinton that they hoped would fortify him heading into the general election. Their concerns increased again Sunday after Trump said he thought a Muslim judge might treat him unfairly because he wants to temporarily ban most foreign Muslims from entering the country.",
        "Donald Trump has insisted over the past two weeks that the judge overseeing the Trump University fraud case cannot act impartially because he is \u201dMexican\u201d (later: \u201dof Mexican heritage\u201d). That insistence has been received poorly, including by formerly stalwart Trump allies such as Newt Gingrich. On Sunday morning, Trump expanded his line of thinking outward. During an interview on CBS\u2019s \u201dFace the Nation,\u201d Trump was asked whether a Muslim judge would similarly be incapable of treating him fairly. His response? \u201dIt\u2019s possible, yes. Yeah.",
        "On Thursday night, Donald Trump told the Wall Street Journal that the Mexican heritage of the judge overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University was an \u201cabsolute conflict\u201d because of the real estate mogul\u2019s proposal to build a wall along the border with Mexico. On Sunday, Trump doubled down on those comments, insisting to John Dickerson of CBS that the judge, Gonzalo Curiel, was treating him in \u201ca hostile manner. \u201d The presumptive Republican presidential nominee added cryptically: \u201cThere\u2019s something going on. \u201d (Side note: It\u2019s not just people of Mexican heritage.",
        "There was a time when Bernie Sanders, the stiff, white senator from Vermont, seemed painfully out of place in black churches. But not now at the end of the long primary trail, and not in Oakland, Calif. at the Allen Temple Baptist Church.",
        "It\u2019s a week like this one that makes you understand why Paul Ryan really didn\u2019t want to be Speaker of the House. With Donald Trump\u2019s nomination now a certainty, Ryan faced increasing pressure from all sides of the GOP to get behind a man with whom he shares almost nothing in common other than the fact that they both are Republicans and Trump barely even that. When you are the and most visible Republican in Washington, you don\u2019t get to take a pass as Ryan clearly would have rather done on publicly supporting (or not) your party\u2019s nominee.",
        "CHICAGO \u2014 Researchers said extending hormone therapy to 10 years reduces the risk of a recurrence of breast cancer in many older women and decreases the chance of a new cancer emerging in the other, healthy breast. The study, which was released Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, involved women who had a type of breast cancer known as hormone . That means the cancer was driven by estrogen, progesterone or both.",
        "When the traffic on Timothy Connor\u2019s quiet Maryland street suddenly jumped by several hundred cars an hour, he knew who was partly to blame: the disembodied female voice he could hear through the occasional open window saying, \u201cContinue on Elm Avenue . . . . \u201d The marked detour around a road repair was several blocks away. But plenty of drivers were finding a shortcut past Connor\u2019s Takoma Park house, slaloming around dog walkers and curbside basketball hoops, thanks to Waze and other navigation apps.",
        "It was a moment for two best friends \u2014 one lying in a hospital bed, the other sitting by her side. One dying from breast cancer, the other promising to care for the young lives she was leaving behind. At a hospital in Virginia, the two women started to cry. \u201c\u2018Will you take my babies? Will you do this for me? \u2019\u201d Stephanie Culley, from Alton, Va. said her friend, Beth Laitkep, asked her. \u201cI told her yes, I would do it in a heartbeat.",
        "The old white sportswriters said the flicking, shying kid with the silly doggerel would get knocked into the ringside seats with one punch. It was 1964, and Cassius Clay hadn\u2019t yet butterflied into the mythic champion Muhammad Ali. He was still incubating in a sweltering Miami Beach gym, where the aging in their narrow neckties watched him work out, disapprovingly, as he rapped out verses on the heavy bag with his light gloves, . The rumor was that he was hanging around with Malcolm and the Muslims. But even worse was the way he fought.",
        "PARIS \u2014 When a Serbian with elastic limbs and enormous heart splayed happily onto the clay and looked up at the sky after match point on Sunday evening at Court Philippe Chatrier, he might have just defied common sense. In the Darwinian cauldron of men\u2019s professional tennis, it made sense that nobody had won four straight Grand Slam singles titles since September 1969, when Rod Laver outlasted Tony Roche in four sets at the U. S. Open to complete the feat. It figured further that nobody had ever done so on three different surfaces."
