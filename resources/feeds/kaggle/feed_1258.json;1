        "On offer in a Swiss referendum this Sunday: a guaranteed monthly income for every adult, paid for by the government. In a fragile global economy that is increasingly driven by mechanized labor, the deal might seem like a welcome security net from one of the richest governments in the world. The Swiss are sure that they could pay for a substantial guaranteed income, if voters got behind it.",
        "Daniel Guth, now a senior at the California Institute of Technology, wanted to take Advanced Placement biology and AP physics when he was a at Annapolis High School in Maryland\u2019s Anne Arundel County. He was told he could not do that unless he agreed to take two additional seminar courses, one in biology and one in physics, designed to support students struggling in those AP subjects. Guth was an academic star at Annapolis High. He already had passed several AP courses with high test scores. Why force him, he asked, to take courses he didn\u2019t need?",
        "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Hillary Clinton has secured enough delegates to win the Democratic presidential nomination, according to the Associated Press, emerging from a long and bruising primary season to become the first woman to lead a major party in the race for the White House. A bitter nomination battle that Clinton was once expected to win in a walk ended abruptly late Monday as she claimed exactly the number of delegates needed to secure victory in her contest against Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, according the AP\u2019s latest tally.",
        "Donald Trump lashed out Monday at former House speaker Newt Gingrich \u2014 one of his close allies who has been mentioned as a possible running mate \u2014 saying that it was \u201dinappropriate\u201d for Gingrich to criticize the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s recent comments about the ethnicity of a federal judge. For more than a week, Trump has repeatedly said that U. S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over fraud lawsuits against his Trump University education business, should recuse himself because \u201che\u2019s a Mexican.",
        "\u201cGoofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes known as Pocahontas, bought foreclosed housing and made a quick killing. Total hypocrite!\u201d \u2014 Donald Trump, in a tweet, May 25, 2016 Donald Trump accused Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( .) of being a hypocrite after Warren attacked Trump for saying, before the housing bubble burst in 2008, that he hoped to profit from a downturn in home prices because of a real estate bubble. (As our colleagues at PolitiFact noted, Trump actually failed to predict the magnitude of the financial crisis, saying he didn\u2019t think the real estate market would \u201ctake a big hit.",
        "BRIARCLIFF MANOR, N. Y. \u2014 In book publishing, there is James Patterson \u2014 and basically everyone else. His author bio: \u201cJames Patterson has written more bestsellers and created more enduring fictional characters than any other novelist today. \u201d Beloved by critics and peers? Not so much. But his popularity among readers remains incontrovertible. He is an industry unto himself. And now the author of popular thrillers \u2014 and children\u2019s books and young adult novels and romance and mysteries \u2014 has launched BookShots a series of short, cheap, novels directed at an audience more prone to reading smartphones than print.",
        "Brock Turner, a former Stanford University swimmer, received six months in jail for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman. (Santa Clara County Sheriff via AP) An effort is underway to recall the judge who gave a sentence to a former Stanford University student convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman outside a fraternity party early last year. The case has been a flash point in the national debate over sexual assault on college campuses. Brock Allen Turner, a former varsity swimmer at Stanford, was convicted on three felony counts of sexual assault for a January 2015 incident.",
        "The Caligulan malice with which Donald Trump administered Paul Ryan\u2019s degradation is an object lesson in the price of abject capitulation to power. This episode should be studied as a clinical case of a particular Washington myopia \u2014 the ability of career politicians to convince themselves that they and their agendas are of supreme importance. The pornographic politics of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, which was preceded by decades of ignorant bile (about Barack Obama\u2019s birth certificate and much else) have not exhausted Trump\u2019s eagerness to plumb new depths of destructiveness.",
        "Bluffing is Donald Trump\u2019s one great talent, and he brazenly bluffed his way to the Republican nomination. Now he is showing his cards, however, and they are utter garbage: racism, ignorance, capriciousness, egomania and general unfitness for office. That should be \u2014 it must be \u2014 a losing hand. Imagine what a disaster it would be if this man were elected president. Really think about it. Then consider your obligation, as a citizen, to prevent such a thing from happening.",
        "Donald Trump needed validation. At a rally Friday, Trump was discussing racial violence at his events and the perception that nonwhite people are against him, when he singled out a black man in the crowd. \u201cLook at my African American over here,\u201d Trump said, pointing. \u201cLook at him. Are you the greatest?\u201d The gesture \u2014 reminiscent of Trump eating a Cinco de Mayo taco bowl at Trump Tower and tweeting \u201cI love Hispanics!\u201d \u2014 was as respectful as if he had just instructed the crowd to \u201clook at my Irish setter over here.",
        "The age of autarky is again upon us. Britain, in two weeks, will vote on whether to leave the European Union, that great postwar project to promote both peace and prosperity. No matter that economists have almost uniformly warned that a possible \u201cBrexit\u201d would devastate the British economy, with an estimated cost of approximately $6, 000 per British household. Disregard news that markets are already freaking out about the consequences for the pound and the overall financial sector; that talent has become skittish about moving to the British isles, whose relationship to the E. U.",
        "Out of the corner of his eye, Paul Ryan must frequently see the Robert A. Taft Memorial and Carillon at the base of Capitol Hill. The bell tower memorializes a senator who so embodied his party that he was called \u201cMr. Republican. \u201d He was the son of a president, wanted desperately to be one himself, and yet on Oct. 5, 1946, risked everything on a matter of principle. He denounced as the trial and the impending execution of 11 Nazis. It was a futile act. Within two weeks, 10 were hanged and one committed suicide.",
        "BARRING A truly extraordinary turn of events, the seemingly endless presidential primary season will conclude Tuesday night with Hillary Clinton as the presumptive Democratic nominee. She and her primary rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) deserve credit for competing largely on issues rather than insults. From here, she will have to contend with a Republican opponent, Donald Trump, who has sent every signal that he will run a campaign that is entirely disrespectful \u2014 of her personally, of the truth, of minority groups, of the media and of a variety of basic democratic norms.",
        "Microbiologist Patrick McGann knew he had identified a dangerous germ. He just didn\u2019t know how dangerous. In a colleague had found a strain of E. coli bacteria from a Pennsylvania woman that tested positive for resistance to a drug called colistin. That\u2019s the antibiotic used when all others fail. McGann, whose job is to prevent outbreaks of new pathogens in the U. S. military\u2019s sprawling system, wasn\u2019t yet alarmed. Sometimes mutations occur spontaneously that make bacteria resistant to an antibiotic.",
        "In the wake of the resignation of Tony Faddell, the founder of smart thermostat maker Nest, the future is looking cloudy not only for the smart thermostat maker, but the broader smart home business as well. Nest, after all, was supposed to be the trailblazer that led us to the smart home revolution. When Google put down $3. 2 billion to buy it in 2014, it appeared to make sense Google was already running much of our online lives, and this would give the company a way to run our offline lives as well.",

        "The Education Department on Monday sent ITT Educational Services a letter requesting the chain to set aside more money to cover losses in the event of its collapse, citing an increased risk to the millions of dollars in federal loans and grants funneled to students attending the schools. Department officials say they are acting out of concern that ITT is under the threat of having its accreditation revoked, a move that could effectively shut down its technical schools.",
        "Richard McGhee and his family believed the worst was behind them. McGhee, a retired case officer at the Defense Intelligence Agency who lives near Annapolis, had spent six months battling leukemia as part of a clinical trial at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. The experimental chemotherapy regimen he was given had worked spectacularly, driving his blood cancer into a complete remission. But less than nine months after his treatment ended, McGhee abruptly fell apart. He became moody, confused and delusional \u2014 even childish \u2014 a jarring contrast with the highly competent person he had been.",
        "When it came to sexually abusing children, Richard Huckle proudly fashioned himself an expert. The Christian schoolteacher from England was so adept at taking advantage of impoverished children in Malaysia and Cambodia, he bragged online that he had authored a guide for others to follow in his footsteps, according to the BBC. \u201dImpoverished kids are definitely much easier to seduce than Western kids,\u201d Huckle wrote in an online post cited by the BBC. \u201dI still plan on publishing a guide on this subject sometime.",
        "The story of how Donald Trump is dividing Republicans in strange ways can be told by his first endorsement of a GOP congressional candidate. Rep. Renee Ellmers ( . C.) won her seat in Congress in 2010 with the help of Sarah Palin and conservative, tea grassroots groups. Now those kinds of groups are actively trying to push her out of office in Tuesday\u2019s primary. They accuse her of abandoning her conservative principles and are running ads against her. The Tea Party Patriots group is even backing her fellow incumbent primary opponent, Rep. George Holding ( . C.).",

        "EMERYVILLE, Calif. \u2014 Sen. Bernie Sanders plans to take stock of his presidential campaign at his home in Burlington, Vt. following Tuesday\u2019s primary here and in five other states. \u201cLet\u2019s assess where we are after tomorrow before we make statements based on speculation,\u201d the Vermont senator said Monday at a news conference here, when asked whether he is willing to endorse rival Hillary Clinton in the coming weeks. \u201cWe\u2019ll be in L.

Over the next 10 months, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority will begin a number of repairs on the region\u2019s subway system that will require temporary line closures, and the suspension of service on weekends. All of this, even though the system is one of the nation\u2019s youngest and serves the locus of political power in richest country on Earth.

But the voting across six states \u2014 which wraps up in California \u2014 will be watched as a showcase of the support still behind Clinton\u2019s resilient rival, Sen.

        "Hillary Clinton has accumulated enough support to secure victory in the Democratic primary, advancing to face a Republican opponent almost no one predicted at this time last year. Her long battle with Bernie Sanders pushed her to more liberal positions on a handful of issues, most notably the minimum wage and international trade, but neither it, nor the expected dynamics of her general election contest with Donald Trump, appears to have fundamentally changed the issue set that Clinton hopes to ride to the White House."
