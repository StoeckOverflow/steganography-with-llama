        "NEW YORK \u2014 Even before the polls closed in New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton knew she was in for a very bad night. The establishment worrywart caucus was freaking out, and the media was rife with speculation of an imminent staff . Was she once again being set up for a fall, a lumbering about to be toppled by a charismatic outsider? Her answer: Get me a bigger plane. Robby Mook, her campaign manager, blanched. But Clinton insisted that she did not want her aides trickling back to the Brooklyn campaign headquarters, one by one, nursing their dejection.",
        "Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said Tuesday that his persistent attacks against a Hispanic federal judge have been \u201cmisconstrued,\u201d an attempt to mitigate accusations of racism and intense scrutiny from Democrats and Republicans alike. Trump has repeatedly argued in recent weeks that U. S.",
        "ORLANDO Standing on my hotel balcony in the hours, I gaze out over several dimly illuminated swimming pools abutting a small lake and a golf course. Beyond the grassy carpet now black with night stretches a vast darkness that ends at a thin strand of lights marking the horizon. An enormous Ferris wheel stands out, tawdry and proud of its daily victory over the sun. Into my brain a Bible verse crawls unbidden: What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.",
        "One of the mysteries of Campaign 2016 is why the Iran nuclear deal has vanished as an issue. But a new book reveals some startling details about how the diplomacy with Tehran began in secret, long before reformers took power there, and the crucial role played by presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. The diplomatic narrative is laid out in \u201cAlter Egos,\u201d by New York Times White House correspondent Mark Landler. He\u2019s the first to disclose the full extent of the Omani \u201cback channel\u201d to Iran that opened in 2009 through a colorful fixer named Salem ben Nasser .",
        "Seven white men and a white woman, Republican members of Congress all, boarded vehicles on Capitol Hill on Tuesday morning for a voyage deep into Anacostia, a largely black and poor section of Washington. Their mission: to reassure nonwhite voters frightened by Donald Trump, their party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee. Their odds of success: exceedingly low. The lawmakers must have perceived their mission to be risky, for they traveled with a veritable arsenal: a Capitol Police \u201cmobile command center\u201d truck, a canine unit, four or five squad cars and a black police vans.",

        "A Virginia school board plans to ask the U. S. Supreme Court to decide whether the Obama administration went too far in directing the nation\u2019s schools to let transgender students use bathrooms of their choice, arguing that the guidance issued to schools is an overreach of power and violates student privacy. [Read the newest court filing in the transgender bathroom case] The U. S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit on Tuesday granted the Gloucester County School Board\u2019s request to put the court\u2019s earlier ruling in the case on hold while it petitions the Supreme Court.",
        "BEIRUT \u2014 Syrian President Bashar signaled Tuesday that his government intends to escalate military efforts to crush the uprising against his rule, saying the bloodshed will not end until he has regained control over all areas of Syria lost to the rebellion. His tough words came amid indications that Russia is preparing to reengage in the war in support of Assad, almost three months after it threw its support behind a U. S. and announced it was withdrawing most of its military from Syria.",
        "Just before 6 p. m. a prison transport van pulled up to a state mental hospital in central Maryland. Inside were two deputies and James Geeter, a man arrested for trespassing at a library in Prince George\u2019s County \u2014 and so mentally incompetent that a judge ordered treatment before he could face the charges. Four hospital staffers, including the clinical director, met the deputies at the door that night last month and turned them away. The psychiatric facility was full.",
        "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday, a rare honor that contrasts sharply with the affront he faced more than a decade ago when he was denied a U. S. visa after Hindu riots killed more than 1, 000 people in the state he then governed. But even as many Indian Americans cheer the ascent of Modi, who met Tuesday with President Obama at the White House, others say they continue to be troubled by his record on human rights since he became prime minister in 2014.",
        "The 2016 race downward in Arctic sea ice continued in May with a dramatic new record. The average area of sea ice atop the Arctic Ocean last month was just 12 million square kilometers (4. 63 million square miles) according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). That beats the prior May record (from 2004) by more than half a million square kilometers, and is well over a million square kilometers, or 500, 000 square miles, below the average for the month.",
        "Bring it on \u201d the brilliant smile of a Stanford swimmer with Olympic dreams, the happy privileged face of a white college kid named Brock Turner. Another picture of him smiling, please. Because this is what a campus sexual predator looks like. And that s the truth too many people refuse to acknowledge. It s the most difficult part of the campus rape culture destroying the lives of so many young women: acknowledging who their rapists are. Turner, 20, was convicted of sexually attacking an unconscious woman behind a dumpster at Stanford University after a fraternity party.",
        "Over the past year and a half, a disturbing and violent trend has been growing in Malawi, a country often known by its nickname: \u201dThe Warm Heart of Africa.\u201d At least 18 people with albinism, a congenital condition resulting in a lack of pigment in the skin, hair and eyes, have been murdered, and many others have been raped or harassed.

        "Editor\u2019s note: Deby Dixon is a wildlife and nature photographer who lives outside Yellowstone National Park. She wrote this essay after the park euthanized a baby bison that it said had been rejected by its herd due to the \u201cinterference\u201d of tourists who tried to rescue it by putting it in their car. The tourists later defended their action, saying they were trying to help the calf. This essay is adapted from an article that first appeared on the website National Parks Traveler. GARDINER, Mont.",
        "The guy had left the table for only a minute. But as soon as he was out of sight, his date whipped out her phone, opened Tinder and started swiping. \u201cIt was deceitful, a little bit,\u201d says Chris McNeal, general manager of Bar Dupont, who\u2019d watched the scene unfold, slightly aghast that this is how people find love in the modern age. It wasn\u2019t even the first time he\u2019d seen a Tinder meetup turn sour.",
        "At the beginning of the decade, Alison and Ann Dadow were yoga entrepreneurs who drove matching Porsches, as identical as they were, around West Palm Beach, Fla. In late May, the twins plunged over the edge of a cliff in Hawaii and fell 200 feet in a Ford Explorer, which crumpled like an old soda can when it hit the slick, jagged rocks peeking out of the Pacific Ocean below. Ann, sitting in the front passenger seat, was pronounced dead at the scene.",
        "The Obama administration believes that about 12 detainees released from the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have launched attacks against U. S. or allied forces in Afghanistan, killing about a Americans, according to current and former U. S. officials. In March, a senior Pentagon official made a startling admission to lawmakers when he acknowledged that former Guantanamo inmates were responsible for the deaths of Americans overseas.",
        "Minutes before her address declaring victory as the Democratic presidential nominee Tuesday evening, Hillary Clinton was worried she might not make it through her prepared remarks without crying. \u201cI was overwhelmed,\u201d Clinton said in an interview with The Washington Post on Wednesday. \u201cIt just was a sense of momentous historic experience \u2014 that I was part of it and it really was hard to actually, you know, make sense of it,\u201d Clinton said, marvelling a day later at the sight of thousands of supporters crowded into a Brooklyn warehouse to celebrate.",
        "There are lines I can fathom and lines I can\u2019t. People waiting for a table outside Bad Saint, the tiny Filipino charmer in Columbia Heights, or Shake Shack, the downtown burger phenom from New York, know the rewards for getting through the door include food that leaves them smiling and eager to return. Other queues leave me scratching my head. Consider Ben\u2019s Chili Bowl, the subject of a recent critique in these pages and best savored for its history, period.",
        "LONDON \u2014 When Shannon Harmon moved to the United Kingdom from Chicago, she did not plan to put down roots. But after nearly eight years, she has a master\u2019s degree from a prestigious British university, works as a digital producer at a organization and has built strong ties in her local community. She also has a massive, problem: She earns less than 35, 000 pounds, or about $50, 000, which means that under new visa restrictions introduced this spring she could be deported after her visa expires in January 2018.",
        "Though often fiercely partisan, Americans have no great love for political parties as such. Ever since James Madison wrote his mistrust of \u201cfactions\u201d into the Constitution, parties and their \u201cbosses\u201d have been repeatedly attacked as privileged insiders bent on thwarting or twisting democratic processes. Madison\u2019s plan worked, partially. With 50 state governments and with a federal government divided between a bicameral legislative branch and a president, the United States produces parties that are relatively unstructured and ideologically amorphous \u2014 and generally only two of them. Parliamentary systems encourage multiple disciplined parties, representing more, and more distinct, interests and sentiments.",
        "The five days in 2008 between the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary were Hillary Clinton\u2019s crucible. They showed what she\u2019s made of and that she should never be underestimated. After Barack Obama\u2019s overwhelming victory in Iowa, the polls all suggested he was about to deliver the second shot of a punch that would have crippled Clinton\u2019s campaign. If he had, the would have lost her chance to fight Obama to a virtual draw in the Democratic contests over the next five months.",
        "After Tuesday night, Bernie Sanders\u2019s infinitesimal chance of winning the Democratic nomination rests on one possibility: that Democratic superdelegates will overturn the will of the voters. This is no small irony: Sanders spent much of his campaign railing against superdelegates and fighting to eliminate the practice of giving party officials and establishment types a say in the nominating process. But the only thing keeping him in the race is the vain hope that superdelegates, the vast majority of whom support Hillary Clinton, will defy the popular vote and throw their support to him.",
        "KC Johnson is a professor at Brooklyn College and the CUNY Graduate Center. Stuart Taylor Jr. is a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Last week, a California judge sentenced former Stanford University swimmer Brock Allen Turner to six months in jail for a horrifying sexual assault on an unconscious, woman. The resulting uproar over the sentence\u2019s undue leniency risks missing the most important lesson of the case.",
        "Two stories in the past 48 hours cement my view that Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) the vanquished Democratic candidate for president, and Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, share the same DNA. These two stubborn outsiders believe they are their campaign\u2019s best political mind. And the damage that outsized and misplaced view of their capabilities has done on their respective quests for the White House is plainly apparent. The lead of the Politico story on the \u201cbitter last days of Bernie\u2019s revolution\u201d says it all.",
        "ON TUESDAY night, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton became the first woman to claim the presidential nomination of a major American political party. It was a historic moment \u2014 but she and the nation have little breathing space to savor the milestone. There is, first, the question of Sen. Bernie Sanders ( . ). Mr. Sanders has fought hard, and he has won much along the way. The issues that matter to many of his supporters, such as income inequality, financial reform, expansion and campaign finance, have come front and center \u2014 with Ms.",
        "JERUSALEM \u2014 At least four people were killed and several seriously wounded in a mass shooting at a trendy Tel Aviv food market Wednesday night. The attacks occurred near Israel\u2019s version of the Pentagon. Police said two assailants were in custody. One of the gunmen was wounded. Israeli authorities described the shooting as a terror attack. The attackers\u2019 identities were not released. Police said the two gunmen were members of the same family from the Palestinian village of Yatta, near the city of Hebron in the West Bank. At about 9:30 p. m.",
        "Washington National Cathedral, one of the country\u2019s most visible houses of worship, announced Wednesday that it would remove Confederate battle flags that are part of two large windows honoring Confederate generals Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee. Cathedral leaders said they would leave up the rest of the windows \u2014 for now \u2014 and use them as a centerpiece for a national conversation about racism in the white church. The announcement comes a year after the cathedral\u2019s the Rev.",
        "BEIJING \u2014 A U. S. spy plane was buzzed by Chinese jets Tuesday as it flew over the East China Sea, with one of the fighter planes approaching in an \u201cunsafe\u201d manner, the U. S. military said. It was the second such incident in three weeks. China responded by accusing the United States of \u201chyping\u201d the incident but said the real problem was U. S. surveillance planes flying too close to its territory.",
        "For at least the third time since he became a candidate for president, Donald Trump was asked whether he seeks God\u2019s forgiveness. The first two times he said no, but in an interview published Wednesday his answer was a bit vaguer. Here is the exchange, which ran on the blog of Cal Thomas, a syndicated columnist and conservative Christian leader: Thomas: \u201cYou have said you never felt the need to ask for God\u2019s forgiveness, and yet repentance for one\u2019s sins is a precondition to salvation."
