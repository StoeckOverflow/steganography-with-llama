        "Donald Trump says a Mexican American judge can\u2019t be fair to Trump University because of his ethnicity. Paul Ryan says this is \u201dthe textbook definition of a racist comment.\u201d Yet the speaker of the House is standing by his endorsement of the presumptive Republican nominee for president. Naturally, the media wants to know why Ryan is still in Trump\u2019s corner. Tomorrow\u2019s front page: I\u2019M WITH RACIST!

        "One moment, she was calmly perusing a shopping aisle with her daughter. The next, she was fighting off an aggressive man attempting to kidnap her child. It all unfolded at a Dollar General in Hernando, Fla. when a man identified by authorities as Craig Bonello grabbed \u201ca petite female who was shopping with her mother,\u201d according to a statement from the Citrus County Sheriff\u2019s Office. The entire attack was caught on a surveillance camera and lasted about 15 seconds. Police accuse Craig Bonello, 30, of attempting to kidnap a girl from a store in Florida.",
        "In the months leading up to Brock Turner\u2019s sentencing for sexually assaulting an intoxicated and unconscious woman at Stanford University, his friends and family members penned letters to the judge, urging him to consider a lighter sentence than the maximum prison term Turner was facing. In March, Turner was found guilty of three felonies \u2014 including assault with the intent to commit rape.",
        "Tennis superstar Maria Sharapova has been banned from the sport for two years after she tested positive for the prohibited substance meldonium during the Australian Open in January, the International Tennis Federation announced Wednesday. The ban is retroactive to Jan. 26, and her run to the quarterfinals at the Australian Open \u2014 along with the 430 WTA points and $281, 633 in prize money she earned \u2014 has been erased from the record books.",
        "Ladies, as everyone knows, are dainty and fragile, and prefer the world to be awash in pastels. Or at least, that\u2019s the philosophy behind the old marketing mantra for making products attractive to women: \u201cShrink it and pink it. \u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine this phrase being uttered in a boardroom in this era. And yet, every so often still, a new product emerges doused in shades of magenta and labeled \u201cfor her\u201d: Dell\u2019s cutesy laptop Della, which promised nifty ways to search for recipes and count calories.",
        "\u201cThe artist\u2019s world is limitless. It can be found anywhere, far from where he lives or a few feet away. It is always on his doorstep. \u201d So said American photographer and filmmaker Paul Strand, who practiced what he preached. He began photographing in New York in 1910 and ended his career in France in 1976. An exhibition of his work, Paul Strand: Photography and Film for the 20th Century, is currently on display at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London until July 3. Strand\u2019s work covers pictorialism and abstractionism, but also is rooted in social consciousness.",
        "President Obama offered his formal endorsement of Hillary Clinton with a video Thursday and plans to campaign with the former secretary of state in Wisconsin next week, efforts aimed at speeding the Democratic Party\u2019s unification around its presumed presidential nominee. \u201cI know how hard this job can be, that\u2019s why I know Hillary will be so good at it,\u201d Obama says in the video. \u201cIn fact I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been someone so qualified to hold this office. She\u2019s got the courage, the compassion and the heart to get this job done.",
        "It had been billed as Bernie Sanders s big day in Washington. Making a last stand as a Democratic presidential candidate, the senator from Vermont was set to meet with President Obama and other leading Democrats and stage a show of his continuing ability to draw throngs of supporters at an outdoor rally near RFK Stadium. Only all that was eclipsed \u201d much like his upstart presidential campaign itself \u201d by Hillary Clinton and the muscle of the Democratic establishment.",
        "Bernie Sanders had barely made it back to Capitol Hill after his meeting with President Obama at the White House when the news broke: Obama was endorsing Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination. And not only that! Obama was delivering the endorsement via a prerecorded video, recorded on Tuesday 48 hours before he even sat down with the senator from Vermont. White House press secretary Josh Earnest insisted the meeting with Sanders was not simply a \u201dformality.\u201d And, apparently, Obama had told Sanders on Sunday that he was planning to endorse Clinton.",
        "On small video screens inside their cockpits, the U. S. pilots spotted their target, an Islamic State checkpoint just south of the Iraqi city of Mosul. In grainy black and white, they could see the enemy manning the barricades and a guard shack. As they prepared to launch their attack, the pilots noticed a potential complication: Two cars approached the checkpoint and stopped. The drivers appeared to be talking with Islamic State fighters. Other cars moved through the checkpoint, but these two vehicles remained on the side of the road. Five minutes passed. Then 10.",
        "A Navy admiral pleaded guilty Thursday to a felony charge of lying to federal investigators in the \u201cFat Leonard\u201d corruption scandal, marking an exceptionally rare instance of a flag officer being criminally prosecuted for actions while in uniform. In a plea deal with prosecutors, Rear Adm. Robert Gilbeau, a special assistant to the chief of the Navy Supply Corps, admitted to concealing the duration and extent of his relationship with Leonard Glenn Francis, a defense contractor who showered Navy brass with prostitutes, cash and epicurean meals over a decade until his arrest in 2013.",
        "Since the 1960s, Republicans have had to battle against liberal elites\u2019 accusations that the GOP is exclusionary, uninterested in the fate of minorities and downright racist because the party rejected welfare state programs, opposed quotas and did not have a lot of national nonwhite leaders. That changed somewhat under President George W. Bush, who championed education and immigration reform. He got 44 percent of the Hispanic vote and 43 percent of the Asian vote in 2004. In the Obama years, the GOP has had mixed results at best.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: Donald Trump\u2019s continued antics \u2014 such as his ongoing racist attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel \u2014 have many Republicans worried that he is further deepening the demographic hole that threatens to swallow up the GOP in this election cycle. Yet Trump seems blithely unconcerned. Perhaps he can\u2019t imagine he is actually alienating key general election constituencies. Or maybe he thinks such tactics will unleash a mighty wave of white working class backlash that will allow him to make great gains in the industrial Midwest.",
        "American conservatives are fond of World War II analogies, especially those that illustrate the dangers of appeasing dictators. In this historical appropriation, today\u2019s conservatives invariably assume the role of Winston Churchill, courageously telling the truth regardless of the consequences. Their liberal adversaries, meanwhile, behave as Neville Chamberlains, hoping against reality that diplomacy and concessions will satiate the desires of evil men.",
        "Tuesday morning, after the Associated Press had called the Democratic nomination for Hillary Clinton, and before the round of primaries that put her over the top with pledged delegates Tuesday night, I sent out a call for readers favorite fictional female presidents, now that this particular fantasy is a step closer to becoming an American reality. The results only served to illustrate how shallow our dreams of female leadership have tended to run.",
        "Here\u2019s a prediction for the summer and fall: whenever Donald Trump says something crazy or despicable that makes Republicans moan in despair over where he\u2019s leading their party, before long you\u2019ll see Speaker of the House Paul Ryan hold a press conference to announce some \u201cnew\u201d policy paper or initiative, intended to demonstrate that \u2026 1) Republicans still have a very serious agenda; and 2) Paul Ryan is a very serious fellow, worthy of all the encomiums Washington reporters have showered on him in recent years. But can Ryan singlehandedly save the GOP brand from the party\u2019s ?",
        "Jack Montague was expelled from Yale University in February, shortly before the basketball team he led went to the NCAA tournament for the first time in more than 50 years and not long before he was expecting to graduate. [Yale goes to the NCAA tournament for the first time in more than 50 years \u2014 after its captain was expelled for alleged sexual misconduct] But the university said a student had filed a formal complaint against Montague to a committee on sexual misconduct, and he was expelled as a result of the investigation. Now Montague is firing back.",
        "Mohamed Khweis never stood out in any particular way. The Alexandria man graduated from Fairfax County\u2019s Edison High School, earned a degree from Northern Virginia Community College and worked as a teller at an area bank. He racked up more than a dozen traffic citations and other petty charges, but in nearly every case, he quietly paid his fine or performed his community service. He told a Kurdish broadcast outlet that he left the United States in December, as any American might, to travel to London.",
        "If I\u2019d asked you 20 years ago to make a list of five things American culture would be obsessing over in 2016, you would have never put \u201cthe O. J. trial\u201d on it. (For that matter, you wouldn\u2019t have put Donald Trump on it either.) But here we are and here it is: The Trial of the (Last) Century has become as comparable and essential to our shared narrative as the ancient tragedies, eternally up for interpretation and reenactment, thematically appropriate to almost any telling of Who We Are.",
        "There\u2019s a scene in the dystopian scifi novel \u201cReady Player One\u201d in which the protagonist glimpses the dossier of personal information a major tech company has gathered on him. It includes his height and weight, his browser history, his address \u2014 even several years of his school transcripts.",
        "The House voted overwhelmingly Thursday to approve a rescue package for Puerto Rico that could allow the fiscally troubled U. S. territory to restructure the $72 billion it owes bondholders in exchange for new federal oversight over its locally elected government. The bipartisan vote followed months of intense negotiations between House Republican leaders, Democratic lawmakers and the Obama administration. Those talks were punctuated by a public relations campaign aimed at derailing any deal that could force bondholders to swallow significant losses.",
        "The jail sentence for Brock Turner, the former Stanford student who was convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman after a fraternity party in 2015, ignited a national debate about how U. S. courts handle such cases. The sentence, which also requires him to register as a sex offender, outraged many who said it was far too lenient for such a serious crime. Prosecutors had asked for six years in state prison last week.",
        "The Army followed its rules while denying a Medal of Honor last year to a Green Beret credited with staving off a brutal ambush in Afghanistan, according to a Defense Department inspector general\u2019s report released Wednesday. But the report provides a unique glimpse into something else: just how subjective decisions surrounding awards for valor can be. The investigation examined the case of Army Sgt. 1st Class Earl Plumlee, who was recommended for the Medal of Honor, the nation\u2019s highest award for combat valor, for his role in repelling a bloody Taliban attack Aug.",
        "It was a bad time for Sen. Cory Gardner to be caught in an elevator with a reporter. Donald Trump had just referred to Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as \u201cPocahontas\u201d \u2014 again \u2014 and the Republican freshman from Colorado was struggling to figure out how to respond. \u201cI think people need to be treated with respect, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve demanded from everyone,\u201d he offered. But was it racist? Gardner clammed up. He politely referred further questions to his press secretary.",
        "As Donald Trump prepares to campaign in at least half a dozen battleground states over eight days, the biggest question is: Which Trump will show up? Many leading Republicans are hopeful that the presumptive GOP presidential nominee who delivered two scripted speeches this week will reveal himself more often on the campaign trail. But there are already signs that the Trump \u2014 who was embroiled in a racial controversy for nearly two weeks after attacking a Latino judge \u2014 could resurface.",
        "U. S. Special Operations Command, which oversees some of America\u2019s most elite forces, is exploring the possibility of having American companies manufacture weapons, such as the that are ubiquitous in war zones. First reported by the Tampa Bay Times, Special Operations Command, or SOCOM, posted a \u201csources sought\u201d solicitation for weapons on a federal contracting site early last month. In April, the command posted a similar notice for weapon ammunition. The term \u201cnon standard\u201d is used for weapons not frequently employed by the United States or its NATO allies. [Report: U.

        "When Sidwell Friends School asked the president whether he would like to speak at his elder daughter\u2019s graduation this spring, he declined. \u201cI\u2019m going to be wearing dark glasses,\u201d he told a group of lunch companions during a visit to Detroit earlier this year. \u201cI\u2019m going to cry. \u201d Barack Obama was true to his word Friday. He did not speak at Malia Obama\u2019s commencement ceremony, which he and the first lady attended, along with family and friends of other graduates of the private school in Northwest Washington.",
        "At this stage in the presidential election, nothing is more important than GOTV \u2014 \u201cget out the vote. \u201d The rallies, the conventions, the debates, the onslaught of negative TV ads, and the cheer and smear campaigns, all those come in a distant second. We can sit them all out. Nov. 8, however, is the calendar event that matters. As the North Carolina NAACP and faith leaders in that state put it, on Election Day, \u201cIt\u2019s our time, it\u2019s our vote.",

        "Somehow, it\u2019s always the parents\u2019 fault. We are too lax, except when we are too helicoptery. We coddle the kids too much, except when we drive them into neurotic overachievement. We are enablers. No, we are Tiger Moms. The societal urge to blame is matched only by the parental instinct to \u2014 ourselves as much as our fellow parents."
