        "LONDON Of the fighting faiths that flourished during the ideologically drunk 20th century, has been uniquely durable. It survives by mutating, even migrating across the political spectrum from the right to the left. Although most frequently found in European parties, is growing in the fetid Petri dish of American academia and is staining Britain\u2019s Labour Party.

        "It was inevitable that we would one day seek ways to kill ourselves with society\u2019s blessing. California recently joined four other states \u2014 Oregon, Washington, Vermont and Montana \u2014 that allow terminally ill patients to commit suicide using drugs. Criteria under the California law include that the patient has a terminal disease, would likely die within six months, is of sound mind and can the \u201cmedicine. \u201d Thanks to medical advances that can extend life beyond what some find acceptable, resulting in unnecessary suffering, many think it\u2019s their right to die with dignity using medications legally prescribed.",
        "WHEN PEOPLE risk their lives to evade armed border guards or pack rickety boats at sea, you can be sure the conditions they are fleeing are frightful. This is as true for the persecuted Rohingya Muslims of Burma who set sail on packed vessels in the Andaman Sea as for the escapees who manage to flee the horrors of North Korea\u2019s prison camps. And it is true for people fleeing Eritrea, a country that won independence from Ethiopia in 1993 and has become a human rights disaster. Listen, for example, to a woman who fled last year.",
        "Gawker Media Group, the parent of the news and gossip site Gawker, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday and put itself up for sale, in moves designed to shield its assets after it lost a $140. 1 million lawsuit to professional wrestler Hulk Hogan in March. Gawker has appealed the judgment against the company, its chief executive Nick Denton and its former editor, A. J. Daulerio, and had asked that it be reduced or stayed while its appeal is pending.",
        "Speaking Wednesday at an economic conference, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made one of the more arguments for marijuana legalization I\u2019ve heard in recent years. It\u2019s worth quoting at length so I\u2019ve done that below: Look, our approach on legalizing marijuana is not about creating a boutique industry or bringing in tax revenue, it\u2019s based on two very simple principles: The first one is, young people have easier access to cannabis now, in Canada, than they do in just about any other countries in the world. [Of] 29 different countries studied by the U. N.",
        "Ever since Elon Musk founded a space company 14 years ago, the goal has always been the same: Establishing a colony on Mars. Now he\u2019s finally beginning to reveal how he plans to get there. Starting as soon as 2018, Musk\u2019s SpaceX plans to fly an unmanned spacecraft to Mars. The unmanned flights would continue about every two years, timed for when Earth and Mars are closest in orbit, and, if everything goes according to plan, build toward the first human mission to Mars with the goal of landing in 2025, Musk has said.",
        "The woman who will presumably lead the Democratic ticket in the fall had the woman who has become the Democrats\u2019 fiercest attack weapon against Donald Trump over for coffee Friday. No coffee date was more closely watched. Sen. Elizabeth Warren was whisked past cameras waiting outside the stately Washington home of Hillary Clinton. There was no immediate word on what was covered during the meeting of Democratic minds, but Democrats had said ahead of time that they would talk about how to defeat Trump, Clinton\u2019s presumptive GOP opponent.",

        "Whale meat is still considered a delicacy in Japan and Norway and among indigenous communities in North America. Some industrial farms in the West treat cows, pigs and chickens with almost unbelievable cruelty before killing them for food. Dolphins, seals, cats and horses all get eaten in various parts of the world. But the culinary custom that generates stronger emotion and more opposition than any other is the East Asian custom of killing and eating dogs. \u201cMan\u2019s best friend,\u201d many people say, should never end up on someone\u2019s dinner table.",
        "It\u2019s a disturbing practice most Americans probably know nothing about: On the day they\u2019re born, all the fluffy male chicks born to hens at hatcheries are gruesomely killed \u2014 usually by being run, while conscious, through what is essentially a blender. That\u2019s because they\u2019re useless to the industry. They can\u2019t grow up to lay eggs, and they weren\u2019t bred to be the chickens sold as meat. But that\u2019s going to change.",
        "She was a old aspiring model from Brooklyn. Searching for a way to crack into the industry, she turned to ModelMayhem. com, a website that connects freelance models to casting agents, photographers and others in the business. She flew down to Miami to meet the agent she had met online and, upon her arrival, he drugged and raped her, according to court filings. Her brutal assault was filmed and posted on the porn website Miami\u2019s Nastiest Nymphos. She awoke bruised and disoriented in a motel room with no knowledge of how she got there.",
        "With yet another storm rolling in, the worry and stress weigh on the farmers who are eager to reap a crop that they have put nearly all their money and resources into. (Elliot Ross) The Mertens aren\u2019t sure how far back farming goes in the family, but their best guess is at least seven generations. Photographer Elliot Ross says he is one of the only children in his generation to have left the tradition.

        "PARK CITY, Utah  \u201d Mitt Romney warned that a Donald Trump presidency could normalize racism, misogyny and bigotry in the national conscience. Businesswoman Meg Whitman compared the presumptive Republican presidential nominee to Adolf Hitler. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) was asked, uncomfortably, how he could explain his endorsement of Trump to a young child.",
        "KABUL \u2014 In a remote area of Afghanistan, where thousands of years of hardscrabble tribal culture increasingly mixes with a resurgent Taliban militancy, this is how Fazl Ahmad allegedly died. Local officials in Ghor province said one of Ahmad\u2019s distant relatives was suspected of killing a former Taliban commander. In December, militants dragged Ahmad from his house and cut out his eyes in retaliation. Ahmad was still alive and screaming when the attackers began carving the skin off his chest, leaving his heart exposed. Then they threw the old laborer off a cliff, officials said.",

Boastful, deceptive, crudely charismatic. Dabbling in xenophobia and sexism, contemptuous of the rule of law, he spouts outlandish proposals that cater to the lowest instincts of those angry or frightened enough to back him. He wins the nation\u2019s top office, triggering fears of an authoritarian, even fascistic U. S. government. Normally, though, this leader resides safely in the pages of American fiction.",
        "An alternate version of the Brock Turner sexual assault story has been spinning in my imagination since last January, when I first heard of his arrest. In my version, he recognizes that what happened on Stanford\u2019s campus behind that dumpster last year was rape. He comes to understand that intoxication is not consent. He takes responsibility for his violent \u201caction\u201d that irreparably harmed another human being, instead of blaming it on alcohol. Rather than spending a year and a half honing his story, making excuses and lawyering up, he pleads guilty.",
        "You have the right to remain silent. And the FBI\u2019s J. Edgar Hoover to thank for it. Fifty years ago this coming Monday \u2014 June 13, 1966 \u2014 the Supreme Court held in Miranda v. Arizona that the Constitution\u2019s Fifth Amendment, which establishes the right against also requires police to advise custodial interrogation subjects that they need not answer questions or make statements. A brief filed by the American Civil Liberties Union is rightly credited with supplying the majority with much of its intellectual ammunition.",
        "Stanford swimmer Brock Turner was convicted of sexual assault after he attacked an unconscious woman. But to hear his father and close friends tell it, Turner isn\u2019t a rapist, just another college kid who got carried away. Surveys of college students often unearth similar misconceptions. When Oklahoma State University professor John Foubert asks his students if they\u2019ve ever raped someone, the answer is always no. Change the phrasing, however, and some admit to committing crimes. Ten percent of fraternity brothers in one campus study reported that they\u2019d penetrated a woman without her permission.",

Turner, 20, faced a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison. But a probation officer assigned to the case recommended that Turner be given a \u201cmoderate\u201d jail term followed by probation.

        "It is at least within the realm of possibility this election that a Republican senator could support the Democratic presidential nominee. One of the Senate\u2019s most moderate Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine, left that option open in an interview this week with the New Yorker. Here\u2019s the full Susan Collins exchange.

        "NEW YORK \u2014 \u201cDude, I have no answers. \u201d It could be construed as a dodge, but coming from Ezra Edelman it\u2019s more like a declaration of purpose. Not only did the D. C. filmmaker have the audacity to make a 7\u00bd documentary about one of the most subjects in recent American history, but he has also won a parade of critical acclaim. New York Magazine called it a \u201cmasterpiece,\u201d while Hank Stuever\u2019s review in The Washington Post called it \u201cnothing short of a towering achievement. \u201d And that\u2019s without peddling any flashy new revelations.",
