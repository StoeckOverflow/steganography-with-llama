What gives? You, my friend, lack grip strength. If you\u2019ve caught a few episodes of NBC\u2019s \u201cAmerican Ninja Warrior,\u201d you\u2019re probably familiar with the concept. Getting through the obstacle course on the show, with all of the climbing and swinging from suspended rings, takes an incredible amount of grip strength \u2014 something commentators often mention.",

Hundreds of young people had packed inside Orlando\u2019s Pulse nightclub for Latino night, a raucous, sweaty dance party featuring bachata, merengue and salsa music. Now close to 2 a. m. the booming party at one of central Florida\u2019s most popular gay nightclubs was winding down. \u201cAll of the sudden something sounded like firecrackers going off,\u201d Ray Rivera, the club\u2019s DJ, told the Orlando Sentinel. \u201cI lowered the music, it stopped for a second, then all of the sudden it sounded again.",

        "One of the manifold tragedies of the Orlando mass murder is how difficult it is for us to experience it and mourn it together. This killing lies at the intersection of so many deep emotions and personal equities: the war against terrorism. Resentment against Islam. Gay rights and pride. Gun control. Many Americans immediately claimed that the shooting justifies their preexisting beliefs, not just about the threats to America, but about the nature of evil. It is totalitarian ideology. Or someone else\u2019s religion. Or religion itself. Or homophobia. Or gun lovers and their political defenders.",
        "The only reasonable response to the massacre in Orlando is to ban the sale of assault weapons. All else, I\u2019m afraid, is just noise. If this ensconces me in an ideological corner, I\u2019m fine with that. If it insults the Constitution, so be it \u2014 any other response would do far greater harm to our freedoms.

It was designed for combat, to kill as many of the enemy as possible in the shortest amount of time. I was pretty good with it, even earned a marksmanship badge, but when the training was over and we returned to the barracks, our weapons were placed in their racks and all bullets were taken from us.
