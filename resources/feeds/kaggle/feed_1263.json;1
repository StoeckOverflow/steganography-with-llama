She was 98. The cause was heart ailments, said her daughter, Carlene Ziegler. In the American beauty shops of the 20th century, styles came and went.",
        "When Sarah Hurwitz sits down at her laptop, she puts on her headphones and imagines Michelle Obama\u2019s exacting voice in her head. The voice might say: No, that transition is clumsy. Or: Are we really telling this story in a way that honors these people? Hurwitz, the first lady\u2019s head speechwriter, has written for the Obamas for eight years and for Michelle Obama exclusively for nearly seven. The two have worked so closely together that nearly every word the first lady has spoken in public has been written or edited by Hurwitz.",

Grimmie, a former finalist on \u201cThe Voice,\u201d was fatally shot in Florida a few days ago. Levine served as her mentor on the NBC show.

        "A day after 49 people were killed in the worst mass shooting in U. S. history, Donald Trump seemed to imply that President Obama might have been connected, in some way, with the attack. \u201dLook, we\u2019re led by a man that either is not tough, not smart or he\u2019s got something else in mind,\u201d the presumptive Republican nominee told Fox & Friends Monday morning. Earlier in the interview, when asked why he called for Obama\u2019s resignation, Trump said, \u201dHe doesn\u2019t get it or he gets it better than anybody understands.",
        "Donald Trump said Monday that he is pulling The Washington Post\u2019s credentials to cover his events because he is upset with the newspaper\u2019s coverage of his campaign. The move puts the newspaper on a long list of media outlets that the presumptive Republican nominee has banned for reporting that displeased him. \u201cBased on the incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting of the record setting Trump campaign, we are hereby revoking the press credentials of the phony and dishonest Washington Post,\u201d read a post on Trump\u2019s Facebook page.",
        "No state voted more heavily for the GOP presidential nominee in 2012 than Utah. And in 2008, it was the Republican state in the union. A new poll shows that Donald Trump is tied with Hillary Clinton in Utah. We\u2019re not quite saying, of course, that Utah is a tossup or that Trump is in real trouble in the state \u2014 or even that it portends trouble for Trump in the 2016 presidential race, more broadly. There are plenty of factors at work here that are unique to Utah and the poll (which we will get to).",

        "Russian government hackers penetrated the computer network of the Democratic National Committee and gained access to the entire database of opposition research on GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, according to committee officials and security experts who responded to the breach. The intruders so thoroughly compromised the DNC\u2019s system that they also were able to read all email and chat traffic, said DNC officials and the security experts.

        "An angry President Obama on Tuesday lashed out at Republicans, and particularly Donald Trump, who have called him soft on terrorism, warning that \u201cloose talk\u201d about Muslims has harmed the United States\u2019 campaign against militant groups in the Middle East and elsewhere. Obama challenged the demand by his critics that he characterize acts of terrorism, including the mass shooting in Orlando, as the work of \u201cradical Islam\u201d \u2014 a phrase the president has refused to use because he believes it unfairly implicates an entire religious group for the acts of militant extremists.",

        "ORLANDO \u2014 Investigators from the FBI peered deeper Tuesday into the life of the Orlando nightclub gunman, even as the bureau faced questions and an internal reckoning over whether it missed warnings signs during a probe of the shooter that ended two years before the shooting. While the probe widened to include the FBI\u2019s prior contacts with the gunman \u2014 including why the earlier investigation, which placed the shooter on a terrorism watch list, was effectively closed \u2014 emerging details about his background raised new questions about the deadliest mass shooting in U. S. history.",
        "Whether the words come from politicians, pundits or the general public, they\u2019ve all been been heard before in Oklahoma City and Charleston, S.

And now in Orlando: \u201dHatred,\u201d \u201dbigotry,\u201d a \u201dtwisted ideology,\u201d a \u201dpoisoned psychology.\u201d But in the grim aftermath of Sunday\u2019s carnage at a gay nightclub in Florida, with at least 49 dead and 53 wounded, what can science tell us about the motivations of a mass murderer? Reports suggesting that gunman Omar Mateen was perhaps struggling with his own sexuality are an important clue.",

        "CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper went after Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (R) hard in a interview Tuesday, calling into question her status as a champion for LGBT Floridians given her work on the legal fight against marriage in the state. And for five minutes, he didn\u2019t relent. Cooper began the interview by quoting Bondi as saying that anybody who attacks Florida\u2019s LGBT community will be gone after \u201dto the fullest extent of the law.\u201d The quote and Tuesday afternoon\u2019s interview were both in regard to the terrorist attack on a gay nightclub in Orlando early Sunday morning.",
        "Following the deadliest shooting in U. S. history, a Baptist preacher stood at his pulpit Sunday night in Northern California and delivered an impassioned sermon praising the brutal massacre at a gay nightclub in Florida. Pastor Roger Jimenez from Verity Baptist Church in Sacramento told his congregation that Christians \u201cshouldn\u2019t be mourning the death of 50 sodomites. \u201d \u201cPeople say, like: Well, aren\u2019t you sad that 50 sodomites died?\u201d Jimenez said, referencing the initial death toll in Orlando, which authorities later clarified included 49 victims plus the gunman. \u201cHere\u2019s the problem with that.",
        "On Sunday evening, shortly after I learned of yet another massacre of innocent Americans by a madman with a gun, I attended the Connecticut premiere of \u201cNewtown,\u201d a documentary chronicling the emotional aftermath for several parents whose children were obliterated by Adam Lanza and his at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

        "Donald Trump\u2019s ban of Post journalists has left other news outlets with a stark choice: your ratings or your responsibility as journalists in a free society? Trump\u2019s announcement that he is barring Post journalists from his events follows similar bans he put on reporters from Politico, Huffington Post, BuzzFeed, Gawker, Foreign Policy, Fusion, Univision, Mother Jones, the New Hampshire Union Leader, the Des Moines Register and the Daily Beast. Trump goons have been known to kick out undesirable reporters at Trump events.",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: Donald Trump responded to the Orlando shooting with a massive display of what he likes to call \u201cstrength. \u201d That simply has to work, right? After all, people are frightened, so they\u2019ll gravitate towards whichever candidate more persuasively promises to smash the enemy \u2014 both without and within \u2014 while ignoring the flouting of American values embedded in the details, right? That\u2019s Trump\u2019s explicit bet. But Politico reports this morning that even Republicans think that Trump\u2019s response to the shooting is profoundly problematic.",

        "It\u2019s common to hear students of the polls say things like: \u201cHillary Clinton will win the election unless some unexpected event pushes people to Donald Trump. \u201d The idea is that Clinton\u2019s strength among Latinos, and women will, all things being equal, allow her to overcome whatever advantage Trump builds among white men unless something shakes the race up. In this scenario, one of the top candidates for the \u201cunexpected event\u201d is a terrorist attack.

        "Does Donald Trump believe in the role of the press in American democracy? It certainly doesn\u2019t look that way. In recent months, his staff has roughed up a reporter and thrown another one out of a press event, and he has insulted journalists and blasted unfavorable news coverage. Yet he has benefited from oodles (that\u2019s the technical term) of free exposure in the media. And he obviously craves media attention \u2014 in much the same way an addict craves his fix.",
        "Hillary Clinton planned a highly anticipated meeting Tuesday night with her Democratic rival, Bernie Sanders, to talk about the party\u2019s agenda before the election in November, as voters in the District cast the final ballots of the party\u2019s grueling nominating contest.

And I believed every word. But, a new study by Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University casts serious doubts on my position as it documents not only the outsized coverage Trump received \u2014 from TV and digital media \u2014 in the early days of his campaign but also how overwhelmingly positive that coverage was.",
        "Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and some vulnerable GOP lawmakers signaled Wednesday that they are open to changing the nation\u2019s gun laws, raising the possibility that the political tide might be shifting on an issue that has sharply divided Americans for years. This isn\u2019t the first time a mass shooting, in this case the massacre in Orlando that killed 49 people this week, has sparked a national cry for congressional action on gun availability. In past instances, such calls to action have been followed by intense pressure campaigns from gun rights supporters urging lawmakers to focus elsewhere.",
        "Top Republicans joined with President Obama and other Democrats Tuesday in sharply condemning Donald Trump\u2019s reaction to the nightclub massacre in Orlando, decrying his rhetoric and his questioning of Obama\u2019s allegiances as divisive and out of step with America\u2019s values. Trump \u2014 who just a week ago signaled an intent to snap his campaign into a more measured tone for the general election \u2014 showed no sign of backing down from his suggestions that Obama was somehow connected to or sympathetic with terrorists, telling the Associated Press that the president \u201ccontinues to prioritize our enemy\u201d over Americans."
