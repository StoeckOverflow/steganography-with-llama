        "For the eighth time during his presidency, President Obama will arrive Thursday in another grieving American city to assume the role of comforter in chief after a mass shooting, to console the victims and their families, and to offer a message of national solidarity and resilience. The long list of attacks during his tenure \u2014 including at a military installation in Fort Hood, Tex.; an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.; and an African American church in Charleston, S. C.",
        "ORLANDO \u2014 Nine body bags were laid out on gurneys when Danny Garcia Pagan arrived at the Orange County medical examiner\u2019s office. Bag by bag, he zipped them open and looked on the faces of the dead. Garcia Pagan, a homicide detective with the Orange County sheriff\u2019s office, had already spent several hours interviewing witnesses to the deadliest mass shooting to strike an American city, reliving the horror that had struck a vibrant gay nightclub just before closing early Sunday. Survivors recalled being stalked by the gunman, a security guard who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State.",
        "Marine veteran Imran Yousuf deployed to Afghanistan in 2011. He is being credited with saving dozens of lives during the attack in Orlando. (Photo courtesy of the Marine Corps Times) When the terrifying blasts of rapid gunfire filled an Orlando nightclub early Sunday, many clubgoers panicked or froze. Amid the swirl of sensory overload, their response was overwhelmingly typical of people under threat. In an emergency situation \u2014 as any first responder can attest \u2014 a victim\u2019s first challenge is overriding the paralysis brought on by extreme fear and confusion.",
        "In the hours after Sunday\u2019s mass shooting at an Orlando night club, Chief John Mina of the Orlando Police Department said the gunman\u2019s weapons included a pistol and an \u201c assault rifle. \u201d On Monday night, officials clarified that the rifle Omar Mateen used in the shooting was not an but a Sig Sauer MCX rifle. While aesthetically similar to and just as lethal as an the MCX is internally a different beast, thus all but removing it from the family of rifles.",
        "Republicans, you are fully justified in panicking. A Washington News poll reports that \u201cnegative views of Donald Trump have surged to their highest level of the 2016 campaign. \u201d Sure, Hillary Clinton is unlikable, but not nearly as unlikable as Trump: The poll finds 70 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of Trump, including a 56 percent majority who feel this way \u201cstrongly. \u201d Negative ratings of Trump are up 10 percentage points from last month to their highest point since he announced his candidacy last summer, nearly reaching the level seen before his campaign began (71 percent).",
        "\u201cToday, there\u2019s only one thing to discuss. \u201d Thus began Donald Trump at New Hampshire\u2019s Saint Anselm College on Monday, before he launched into his speech on national security after Sunday\u2019s slaughter at Orlando\u2019s Pulse nightclub. He emphasized that political correctness \u2014 specifically, President Obama\u2019s ongoing unwillingness to use the phrase \u201cradical Islam\u201d \u2014 was impeding our understanding of the massacre and our ability to address it. Trump reminded Americans that the principles of radical Islam are not consistent with our principles; they are and .",
        "THE MORNING PLUM: Americans hate their two leading choices for president, which means we\u2019re headed for a general election bloodbath of negativity that will lead Americans to hate politics even more! Why are the two parties foisting such awful, despised figures upon the poor voters, who just want leaders they can feel good about? At least, this is the lament we regularly hear. But it isn\u2019t that simple. In reality, for now, at least, there\u2019s no real equivalence between the negative views of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.",

        "The body of a boy snatched by an alligator at a Disney resort in Florida has been found, ending a desperate search that began as a rescue operation and eventually became a grim recovery effort, officials said late Wednesday afternoon. Divers found the remains at 1:45 p. m. near the area where the boy was attacked the previous night; his body was recovered about two hours later, said Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings. The sheriff identified the toddler as Lane Graves of Elkhorn, Neb.",
        "By a vote on Tuesday, the Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act for the next fiscal year. It did not include amendments that would have required greater authorization for conflicts, and did not include an amendment from Sen. Rand Paul ( .) to end Selective Service. Instead, it welcomed women into Selective Service for the first time, starting in 2018, unless that policy is stripped when the bill goes to conference. The vote contained some element of surprise, as Republicans had stopped the female draft provision in the House.",
        "Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who pledged for months not to seek to the Senate as he waged an campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, said Wednesday that he is rethinking that decision and could enter the race as soon as next week. Rubio said his decision followed a Sunday conversation with his friend Florida Lt. Gov. Carlos (R) who is running to succeed him in the Senate, on the sidelines of the scene of the terror attack in Orlando. \u201cObviously, I take very seriously everything that\u2019s going on \u2014 not just Orlando, but in our country,\u201d Rubio said.",
        "Hillary Clinton is launching a large television advertising buy in eight swing states, her first in the general election, as she presses her central argument that Republican Donald Trump is unfit for the White House. Clinton has purchased advertising time on television stations in Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio, Colorado and Nevada, according to a Democrat tracking ad buys and public records in several of those states. The Washington Post independently confirmed that the Clinton campaign has reserved time on network affiliates in a of those states.",
        "Donald Trump effectively secured the Republican presidential nomination on May 3. That was 43 days ago. Today, Trump is no closer to uniting the Republican Party or pivoting to the general election than he was six weeks ago. And that is, at a minimum, a massive waste of a critical time period and, at worst, a mistake that could severely jeopardize his chances of winning the White House in November.",
        "GOSHEN, N. Y. \u2014 The fairy tale eggplant is nearly seedless, light purple and and tiny enough to fit in the palm of your hand. Its shape is familiar but it tastes less bitter than the common variety. Fairy tale eggplants are hardly a staple of the American dinner table and are nearly nonexistent in supermarkets. And yet, Blue Apron, the delivery service, has plenty of use for them: The company expects to buy half a million pounds of them this year. In fact, executives think they are buying literally the entire commercial supply of the obscure produce.",
        "When Britons go to the polls on June 23, they will have the opportunity to jettison their country\u2019s membership in the European Union \u2014 an outcome popularly known as Brexit. But the ballot won\u2019t say anything about what should replace E. U. membership. That will be up to negotiators \u2014 representing Britain on one side and the governments of the 27 other E. U. member nations on the other \u2014 who will spend the next two years hammering out the terms of divorce if Britain votes to leave.",
        "Free parking makes it cheaper to own a car. But, as UCLA economist Donald Shoup has long argued, it makes everything else more expensive. Parking at the supermarket is embedded in the cost of groceries. Parking attached to an apartment building is built into the price of rent. And because cities typically require developers to build a minimum amount of parking \u2014 say, one spot per bedroom in each housing unit, or two per thousand square feet of commercial space \u2014 you may pay for the cost of parking even if you never drive a car.",
        "The White House got in on the booming market for \u201cwomen\u2019s summits\u201d Tuesday with a conference at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center billed as the \u201cUnited State of Women. \u201d What made it stand out from all of the rest?

        "LONDON \u2014 A rising star in Britain\u2019s Parliament was shot and stabbed to death Thursday in an attack that stunned the nation and brought the country\u2019s European Union referendum campaign to an abrupt halt just a week before the vote. The killing was of the sort that has become all too common in the United States, but is virtually unheard of in Britain: without warning, and ultimately, perhaps, inexplicable.",
        "GREENSBORO, N. C. \u2014 As thousands of Donald Trump supporters streamed out of an evening rally here this week, they walked past a handful of vendors from Ohio selling simple white featuring Hillary Clinton, Monica Lewinsky and a vulgar joke. The back of the shirts read: \u201cTRUMP THAT !\u201d One woman laughed and said to the man with her: \u201cYou have to get one!\u201d A group of four women pulled out their wallets and tried to bargain the vendors down from $20. One of the vendors shouted again and again: \u201cTrump that !",

        "An effort to pass new legislation in the wake of a deadly mass shooting in Orlando is poised to end in a familiar impasse in the coming days \u2014 and potentially pit Republican lawmakers against their presumed presidential nominee, Donald Trump, who called for congressional action. The issue quickly gripped Capitol Hill anew this week after a shooter killed 49 people at a nightclub early Sunday in Orlando. The assailant had been on the FBI\u2019s terrorist watch list, but he was removed in 2014 because of a lack of evidence that he would commit an immediate crime.",
        "ORLANDO \u2014 President Obama met Thursday afternoon with relatives of people killed in the recent shooting rampage here as well as with survivors of the attack, again making a grim pilgrimage to mourn a mass killing and try to console those left behind. He also again called on lawmakers to pass stronger gun control laws, urging them to help \u201cend the plague of violence that these weapons inflict on so many lives.",
        "Sen. John McCain ( .) the elder Republican statesman, said President Obama was \u201cdirectly responsible\u201d for the terror attack in Orlando due to his failure to combat the rise of the Islamic State terror group. McCain\u2019s statement goes beyond the criticism of Obama that has been leveled by his Republican colleagues in the Senate, and it follows remarks made this week by presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, who seemed to connect Obama to the attack in a Monday interview and on Wednesday tweeted an article claiming that Obama \u201cactively supported\u201d the terrorist group that became the Islamic State.",
        "The American people know extremism when they see it. This is very unfortunate for Donald Trump. And it is a nightmare for Republican leaders who see more clearly every day how his candidacy has become a trap: They desperately want to free themselves from the moral wreckage Trump leaves behind but are stuck with a nominee who speaks for a majority of their rank and file.",
        "Mitch Daniels, former governor of Indiana and current president of Purdue University, knows that no one in the audience is there to hear a commencement speaker. When, however, he addressed his institution\u2019s class of 2016, it heard him distill into a few lapidary paragraphs a stance toward life that illuminates this political season. A rite of spring in America is, Daniels noted, the dispensing of diplomas that are similar in what they announce but dissimilar in what they actually denote. They all pronounce the recipient to be a bachelor of this or a master of that.",

        "Robert Kagan is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a contributing columnist for The Post. Will the Republican Party that made Donald Trump its nominee protect us from Trump when he is president? Even as they call him a \u201ctextbook\u201d racist and acknowledge his scant regard for the rule of law, Republican leaders assure voters that the U. S. system of checks and balances will contain their candidate\u2019s authoritarian impulses. Congress and the judicial system will keep Trump under control. History and recent events suggest that is a risky proposition.",
        "THE WEEK after the Orlando terrorist attack, we are told, is no time for a debate on gun control. Expanding the list of people who cannot legally own guns or tightening background checks would not have stopped this particular tragedy. Omar Mateen, an American citizen inspired by some combination of radicalism, hate and despair to kill 49 people at a gay nightclub, was not on a terrorist watch list. Better background checks may not have stopped him. If assault weapons were banned, he might have used other kinds of guns.",
        "Imagine growing up hearing from those you love and trust that certain groups of people are evil. In fact, these people are so bad, so wrong, that God himself will punish them. Imagine absorbing this hatred deep into your bones. Imagine that you then discover, at some point in your adolescence, that you are one of these people. They are the hated. You are the hated. We don\u2019t know the details of Omar Mateen\u2019s sexuality. Perhaps he did not fully understand. But according to some, Mateen expressed romantic interest in men."
