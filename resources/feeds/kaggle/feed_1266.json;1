        "Joanne Barnaby was deep in the deadfall, smeared in mosquitoes and blood, dehydrated and near exhaustion, when she heard the call of a mama bear searching for its cub. Barnaby couldn\u2019t believe her luck. Twelve hours earlier, she had been picking mushrooms in the remote Canadian wilderness when she had heard a growl behind her. She turned around and saw Joey, her faithful mutt, locked in a snarling standoff with a skinny black wolf. For twelve hours, the wolf had pursued Barnaby and her dog through the forests of the Northwest Territories.",
        "H\u00e9ctor Garc\u00eda was described by Conaculta President Consuelo Saizar as a man who \u201cphotographed the soul of Mexico. \u201d His photography exists in the murky overlap of photojournalism and fine art. Spencer Throckmorton, curator of the upcoming exhibition \u201cH\u00e9ctor Garc\u00eda: Sixty Years of Remarkable Photography,\u201d said Garc\u00eda \u201cdidn\u2019t just do straight photography. \u201d He blended information with aesthetics, often with a sense of irony. Garc\u00eda, who was born and raised in Mexico City, is admired as one of Mexico\u2019s most influential photographers.",
        "The hole that Donald Trump has dug for himself keeps getting deeper. On nearly every front, his position continues to deteriorate. Unless he reverses course, Republicans are heading toward a wrenching week at their convention in Cleveland next month, and potentially worse in November. National polls alone provide an incomplete picture of the current state of the presidential race, but the shifts over the past few weeks should make Republicans beyond nervous.",
        "PHOENIX \u2014 If there is one place where the dramas and subplots of Campaign 2016 collide, it is across the sprawling and scorching desert state of Arizona. Here lives Donald Trump\u2019s restive base of white voters unsettled by the country\u2019s social transformation and fired up to dismantle Washington\u2019s power structure. Here also lies the Democrats\u2019 sleeping giant \u2014 an estimated 350, 000 Latinos who are not registered to vote, but who could mobilize against the presumptive Republican presidential nominee over his incendiary rhetoric. Then there are the politicians.",
        "Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union could send shock waves across the global economy and threaten more than a trillion dollars in investment and trade with the United States. International policymakers are ramping up their warnings of the dangers of a British exit popularly known as \u201dBrexit\u201d \u2014 from the political and economic alliance that has united Europe for the past four decades. Voters in Britain will decide whether to leave or remain in the European Union in a referendum on Thursday, but financial market volatility has already spiked as polls show a growing desire to abandon the partnership.",
        "After a lifetime of angst and embarrassment, Omar Mateen was on the verge of realizing a longtime dream in the spring of 2007. He was about to graduate from a Florida training academy that would put him on a path to being a police officer. He had left behind his youth as a pudgy, kid to become a bodybuilder. He was learning how to shoot a gun. Now it was all about to fall apart. At a class barbecue, Mateen told a fellow cadet he was \u201callergic\u201d to pork, and he got teased about it.",
        "FORT PIERCE, Fla. \u2014 In the Fort, as many call this old Army post, some Muslims last week prayed in an unmarked building, while others worshiped at another nearby mosque where some recent passersby yelled \u201cMurderers!\u201d Sheriff\u2019s and police cars have been patrolling outside both. Omar Mateen, the Orlando shooter, lived in the Fort, where other Muslims also raise families and work in hospitals and run businesses.",
        "It\u2019s an routine for Americans: mass shooting, dramatic calls for change, inaction. It happened when 20 schoolchildren were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School. When a dozen people were killed in an Aurora, Colo. movie theater. When almost three dozen were slaughtered at Virginia Tech. But this time, things might be different. Not because of the record number of people killed in Orlando or because this heinous act was a terrorist attack, a hate crime and a mass shooting. It\u2019s because the victims were part of a social movement with infrastructure and political largely unmatched within the movement.",
        "Kerry Eleveld is a writer for Daily Kos and the author of \u201cDon\u2019t Tell Me to Wait: How the Fight for Gay Rights Changed America and Transformed Obama\u2019s Presidency. \u201d Just three days after President Obama reminisced that \u201cone of the most special moments\u201d of his presidency came when the White House was awash in rainbow colors following last year\u2019s ruling, he stood in the White House briefing room and sought to console a nation reeling from the slaughter of at least 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando.",
        "people were slaughtered over the weekend after a gunman opened fire inside an Orlando club filled with Pride Month revelers. We\u2019re learning more about the killer, who apparently has a history of violence and bigotry, often aimed at the LGBT community. According to reports, the killer\u2019s father said that his son had become \u201cvery angry\u201d after seeing two men kissing in public several months ago. This is how we live our lives as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in the United States. Even in 2016, our mere existence can still be considered a threat.",
        "Is fatherhood political? As we celebrate Father\u2019s Day in this election year, Republicans and Democrats continue to grow further apart in terms of their views on candidates, policies and political events. And our research suggests that even being a dad isn\u2019t exempt from that trend. Using data from a recent Pew Research Center survey of American families, we were able to explore in detail how family structure and attitudes shape and are shaped by contemporary politics.",
        "Every weekday morning for 30 years, my father donned his work uniform \u2014 a crisp blue or white shirt, dark slacks and a tie. He then drove to an elementary school on the northwest side of Detroit to instruct classrooms of 30 or more and students in the basics of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. My father, Harold Shelton Jr. worked in the Detroit Public Schools, a system struggling in the wake of factory closings, declining population and increasing poverty rates when he arrived in 1973.",
        "KABUL \u2014 America\u2019s longest war is about to include more cash for Afghanistan\u2019s army and police force \u2014 without any new conditions to try to ensure it doesn\u2019t get gobbled up before making it to the battlefield. At a NATO summit in Warsaw that begins July 8, the United States and its allies will try to raise $15 billion to fund Afghan security forces through 2020. About $10.",
        "The enormous mansion in Northern Virginia was built as a monument to Rodney P. Hunt\u2019s success, a trophy estate along the Potomac River to mark his rise from teen lawn mowing hustler to government contracting multimillionaire. But on Thursday, the home on Chain Bridge Road in McLean \u2014 valued at $24. 5 million \u2014 was auctioned on the steps of the Arlington County courthouse for $7. 3 million to an undisclosed buyer in one of the region\u2019s largest foreclosure sales.",
        "BIRSTALL, England \u2014 The man charged with shooting and stabbing to death a rising star of British politics gave his name Saturday as \u201cdeath to traitors, freedom for Britain\u201d during his first court appearance since the killing stunned this nation on Thursday. Thomas Mair, 52, made the comment when a judge asked for his name in a London magistrate\u2019s court. Mair was officially charged Saturday with the murder of Jo Cox, a Parliament member of the Labour Party who had been an outspoken advocate for refugees, immigrants and Britain\u2019s continued membership in the European Union.",
        "Much of what I know about my father as a man, I got from observing him at work. In our house, Father\u2019s Day was special, not because it was a day for our father but because it was a day for all fathers: a for his menswear store when business picked up (second only to Christmas,) when mother was called to work the cash register and I, even as a young boy, was called to man the broom, the stockroom and the tailor shop. The store, located in Canton, Ohio, was called Mr.",
        "What is the next subprime? This is an urgent question among a certain class of investors who seem traumatized by a stream of negative market events. First the bubble destroyed their 1990s vision of easy riches; then the housing boom and bust in the 2000s hurt their single biggest asset. The credit crisis and Great Recession next wreaked havoc on their collective psyche; the commodities bust, which began in 2011, was perhaps the final straw. Along the way, there were lots of missed warning signs: ridiculous tech valuations, booming inflation, unsustainable home prices, EZ mortgages.",
        "CHICAGO \u2014 It was dinnertime on the first evening of the People\u2019s Summit, and Erin Stewart and Maureen Cruise were arguing about the future of democracy. Stewart, a supporter of Bernie Sanders, was excited about a new online list of \u201cBerniecrats\u201d to support down the ballot. Cruise, who had ditched the Democratic Party for the Green Party five years ago, could not get past the name at the top of that ballot: Hillary Clinton. \u201cShe\u2019s a sociopath,\u201d Cruise said. \u201cWhen I first saw Bill Clinton speak, I almost fainted.",
        "Larry Hogan is doing it. Mark Kirk is doing it. Even Richard Armitage is doing it. Defect from Donald Trump, that is. And a lot of other Republican elected officials are hinting that they will be next. You can see why it\u2019s tempting for Republicans to join the #NeverTrump team. It\u2019s a way to insulate yourself from constant questions from the media about every single controversial thing your presidential candidate says. \u201dI have said I\u2019m not for Donald Trump,\u201d is a nice for an embattled politician.",
        "Donald Trump has proven very good at one thing since securing the Republican presidential nomination on May 3: Having really, really bad weeks. This week was no exception. First came his decidedly mixed response to the largest mass shooting in U. S. history in a nightclub in Orlando. After briefly expressing condolences, Trump was back to his usual self, tweeting a note about how he was right about the threat posed by Islamic terrorism. Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don\u2019t want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!",
        "Workers spraying pesticides on a sugar cane field discovered the badly decomposed body in a ditch just south of Baton Rouge. Lyntell Washington, a middle school administrator, had been missing since last week. Police began looking for the after finding her daughter wandering alone in a Baton Rouge parking lot near her mother\u2019s abandoned vehicle. The body turned out to be Washington\u2019s. She died from a gunshot wound to the head, and she was seven months pregnant.",
        "The woman was inside of her Colorado home Friday night when she heard the screams. She ran outside to discover a mountain lion on her son, who had been playing with an older brother, according to the Pitkin County Sheriff\u2019s Office. So the woman, whom authorities haven\u2019t identified, sprang into action.",
        "An archivist has discovered a rare collection of more than two dozen letters and documents from President Obama\u2019s father that were written more than a ago as he was trying to make his way in the United States.

S. universities and foundations was made in 2013, and was first reported by the New York Times on Saturday.",

I was maybe 14 or 15 at the time \u2014 an age when kids are well aware of their parents\u2019 shortcomings. \u201cOf course not,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know your father; he likes to help people. \u201d My dad did like to help people.

        "\u201cI feel so bloated\u201d is a phrase you most likely have uttered or have heard many times from family and friends. I personally say it more than I\u2019d like to admit, and my husband calls his belly his \u201cfood baby. \u201d Apparently, we are not alone. Surveys reveal that 10 to 25 percent of healthy people frequently experience bloating, according to a study published in International Scholarly Research Notices: Gastroenterology. But the word \u201cbloating\u201d means different things to different people.",
        "DOVER, England \u2014 To beat back the marauding hordes of continental Europe, the medieval English built an immense stone castle atop the sheer white cliffs of Dover, with walls and royal soldiers on constant watch for anyone who dared trespass upon their blessedly detached isle. Eight centuries later, the modern English are still not quite sure whether the people across the water are friend or foe.",
        "BURLINGTON, Vt. \u2014 When Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Democratic presidential candidate, returns to Capitol Hill to vote Monday, he is expected to be accompanied by his constant traveling companions from the campaign trail: the U. S. Secret Service. Although Hillary Clinton has clinched the party\u2019s nomination, Sanders retains one of the trappings of a candidate. A team of agents still guards him at his home, where they\u2019ve constructed a small watch station on the property. They travel with him on commercial and charter flights and use a motorcade to whisk him through cities he visits.",
        "A few weeks ago, a woman lay dying in Virginia. She said it beat the alternative. \u201cFaced with the prospect of voting for either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton,\u201d her obituary said, \u201cMary Anne Noland of Richmond chose, instead, to pass into the eternal love of God. \u201d The dead have had an unusual amount to say this election cycle. They have forgone flowers for votes. They have looked back on their lives and said their \u201conly regret is NOT being able to vote against Hillary Clinton.",
        "As the first horrible week in Orlando came to a close, Evan Fagin was feeling what other LGBT friends were also feeling: a muggy sadness that felt like it maybe hadn\u2019t gotten to its worst yet, even while the rest of the country slid on. There were fewer and fewer news trucks parked near the nightclub where 49 people had been killed the weekend before. The top stories on the national morning shows were no longer about the shootings."
