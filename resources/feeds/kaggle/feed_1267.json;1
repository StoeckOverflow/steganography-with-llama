        "Shortly before the 2004 Illinois Democratic primary for the U. S. Senate, which he was to win by a landslide, Barack Obama was riding high. After about a year of nonstop campaigning, the Illinois state senator had raised far more money than any of his rivals, and his path both to the nomination and to the floor of the U. S. Senate seemed assured. But his closest advisers sensed that the candidate and father of two \u2014 Malia and Sasha \u2014 was feeling a bit down and listless.",
        "A political crisis is usually preceded by an intellectual and moral crisis. Dominant ideas that once seemed to hang together lose their hold when they are exposed as contradictory and incoherent. Similarly, moral claims made on behalf of a worldview can, gradually or suddenly, come to be seen as empty. Demoralization comes before defeat. This is what happened in the Soviet Union.",
        "Last hope for the Republicans: Declare Donald Trump the winner at the convention in Cleveland next month, and then persuade him to go home. This admittedly would be a delicate maneuver. Nothing like it has happened before. It could work, though, if, as many have believed all along, Trump does not really want to be president. He wants to be elected, sure, but does he want to serve? He wants to be respected as the champion, but does he want the prize?",
        "We Americans have a confused and contradictory relationship with vacation. In theory, we love it; in practice, we often dread it. So much expectation is heaped on a few weeks of free time that disappointment, if not inevitable, is common. Worse, our escape from the job and daily routine fills us with anxiety that, somehow, this interlude will inflict a gruesome revenge once we return to work. Nevertheless, we go forth. We hustle to beaches, mountains, national parks, theme parks, unfamiliar cities or (best yet!) the back yard.",
        "Ashish K. Jha is director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, the K. T. Li professor of health policy at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. An expert panel convened by the World Health Organization just declared that there is no scientific basis for canceling, postponing or moving the 28th Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in August or the Paralympics in September because of the Zika outbreak.",
        "CNN, in what we hope will be a trend, is hosting a town hall Wednesday with the Libertarian ticket, former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson and former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld. Considering how poorly Donald Trump is doing, the Libertarian ticket stands to gain a record share of the vote and offers voters from both major parties an alternative to \u201cholding their noses\u201d or not voting for president. The Libertarians deserve real, substantive questions (as opposed to \u201cDo you really think you can win? \u201d). For one thing, they differ with both candidates on several issues that deserve exploration.",
        "MOST OF the country has moved on from the Internal Revenue Service targeting controversy, which turned out to be not much of a scandal. Although initial reports seemed highly suspicious, it\u2019s been clear for some time that administrative incompetence was the likely culprit, not the Obama administration vindictively singling out conservative groups for IRS scrutiny. But Rep. Jason Chaffetz ( ) and the other Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee are still outraged.",

        "As the owner of a popular gun store in Amelia, Ohio, James Baker was known for preaching safety first. In the end, a class cost the his life. On Saturday, Baker was fatally shot when a student in a class at KayJay Gun Shop accidentally discharged a weapon while practicing malfunction drills, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer. The bullet traveled through a wall and into an adjacent room, where Baker was struck in the neck, the paper reported. Baker was pronounced dead at the scene, according to ABC affiliate WCPO.",
        "Supporters of Donald Trump got an unexpected plea on Saturday: a request to send the billionaire money. It was an \u201demergency\u201d request, the Hill reported, representing an urgent need for an infusion of $100, 000 to put ads on the air in battleground states. Why Trump couldn\u2019t simply write a check to cover the costs apparently wasn\u2019t explained, but the missive was useful regardless: It demonstrates clearly the difficult position of the Trump campaign with only 142 days to go. We looked at Trump\u2019s sliding poll numbers on Friday, but it\u2019s worth adding a bit more context.",
        "After doubling down on his proposal to ban some immigrants by including those from countries with a history of terrorism, Donald Trump is now doubling down on another controversial idea in the wake of the Orlando massacre: profiling Muslims already in the United States. At a rally in Atlanta on June 14, GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump claimed immigrants coming into the U. S. believe in \u201dexecution for things that you would say are like standard parts of life.\u201d Trump suggested the U. S. should help build safe zones in Syria for refugees instead of allowing them in.",
        "With a group of Republican delegates working to stop Donald Trump at next month\u2019s convention, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) has given no indication that he plans to stop them. \u201dIt\u2019s not my job to tell delegates what to do,\u201d Ryan told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd in an interview that aired Sunday on \u201dMeet the Press.\u201d \u201d \u2026 They write the rules.

        "Dustin Johnson incurred a stroke penalty for possibly causing his ball to move as a he took practice strokes on the fifth green at the U. S. Open Sunday. The problem was that USGA officials decided to wait until after Johnson\u2019s round had ended before ruling despite conferring with him at the time, and he was left to play out his final holes \u2014 most of them spent atop the leaderboard \u2014 unsure of what his final score would be.",
        "A second former Vanderbilt football player was convicted Saturday of the rape of an unconscious woman in his dormitory room, almost three years after the incident occurred. Brandon Vandenburg, who was found guilty in a Nashville courtroom on all five counts of aggravated rape, two counts of aggravated sexual battery and unlawful photography, faces a prison sentence of 15 to 25 years, according to The Tennessean.

        "On Friday, John Kerry \u2014 who has led a push on climate change like perhaps no other U. S. secretary of state, culminating in the Paris climate accord late last year \u2014 visited perhaps the starkest indicator of the problem in our hemisphere: the enormous Jakobshavn (or Sermeq Kujalleq) glacier of Greenland.

        "Sometimes, it is simply impossible not to close your eyes and wonder what would have been if, 30 years ago Sunday, Len Bias had not died of a cocaine overdose two days after becoming the No. 2 player taken in the NBA draft. Bias, who had shown so much promise at Maryland, was targeted for years by Red Auerbach as the Next Great Celtics player, the one who would take the franchise past the Larry Bird era. Instead, he was a legend interrupted in the NBA, his death described by Bird as \u201cthe cruelest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.",
        "Donald Trump abruptly fired top aide Corey Lewandowski on Monday in an urgent move to reboot his floundering campaign, which has been besieged by organizational turmoil, strategic mishaps and an erratic message. Trump\u2019s dismissal of Lewandowski \u2014 his combative campaign manager and one of his aides \u2014 was seen as an effort to calm allies, donors and Republican officials who have grown increasingly alarmed by recent missteps and unwanted dramas that threaten to undermine the presumptive GOP presidential nominee\u2019s chances in November.",
        "Donald Trump fired campaign manager Corey Lewandowski on Monday after months of tensions between Lewandowski and Trump convention manager Paul Manafort. The move reportedly came at the urging of Trump\u2019s children most notably his daughter, Ivanka. Lewandowski sat down with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash for an interview on Monday after his dismissal. It\u2019s was, um, a bizarre conversation in which Lewandowski repeatedly suggested everything was going awesomely! and praised Trump time and time again. Using Genius, I annotated it. You can too!

        "A campaign to stop Donald Trump from becoming the Republican presidential nominee has the support of nearly 400 delegates to the GOP\u2019s convention next month, according to organizers, quickly transforming what began as an idea tossed around on social media into a force that could derail a national campaign. While organizers concede their plan could worsen internal party strife, they believe they are responding to concerns among conservatives about Trump, who is suffering from declining poll numbers after weeks of missteps and embarrassing headlines.",
        "As he talked on the phone with dispatchers and crisis negotiators from the bathroom of the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, gunman Omar Mateen said that a vehicle outside contained explosives and that he would \u201cignite it\u201d if police tried to \u201cdo anything stupid,\u201d according to a partial transcript released by the FBI on Monday. He told those on the other end of the phone that he \u201cdid the shootings\u201d and he vaguely threatened more attacks. \u201cIn the next few days,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to see more of this type of action going on.",

        "In May (was it only last month?) Donald Trump\u2019s Republican competitors left the presidential primary race. GOP officials scrambled to endorse him. There was talk big donors were coming on board. Many conscientious conservatives were in a funk, disillusioned with a party (albeit only a plurality of primary voters) who could select a charlatan and a bigot. Lifelong Republicans were appalled at the elected leaders willing to carry water for a demagogue. There was widespread anxiety Trump would beat expectations in the general election just as he did in the primaries.",

And they got an unexpected assist, when Donald Trump tweeted",
        "The Senate on Monday voted down four competing gun control proposals, allowing Democrats and Republicans to stake out political turf around a controversial, emotional issue that promises to play big in a campaign year.

        "The Supreme Court ruled Monday that courts need not throw out evidence of a crime even if the arresting police officer used unlawful tactics to obtain it. But the case more likely will be remembered for a fierce and personal dissent from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who said the decision would exacerbate illegal stops of minorities. Her opinion explained \u201cthe talk\u201d that black and brown parents have with their children about police interactions, invoked Ferguson, Mo. and, without direct acknowledgment, referenced the sentiments of the Black Lives Matter movement.",
        "BRUSSELS \u2014 Days ahead of Thursday\u2019s British referendum on whether to break free from the European Union, many here fear the decision could lead to the destruction of one of the most ambitious political projects since the Holy Roman Empire. across the continent are salivating at the prospect of Britain\u2019s departure, hoping to sever their own territories from a map that stretches from the sunny coasts of Portugal to the frigid taiga of Finland.

        "The national unemployment rate has fallen by more than half since the nation emerged from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. It peaked at 10 percent in 2010 and stood at just 4. 7 percent last month. That\u2019s mostly good news: Private employers have added more than 14 million jobs.
