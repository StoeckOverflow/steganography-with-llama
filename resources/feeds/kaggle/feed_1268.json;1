        "The first warning sign came before the plane had even taken off. Chad Cameron Camp had his choice of seats on the American Airlines flight from Dallas to Portland, Ore. But Camp, 26, curiously chose a middle seat \u2014 right next to an unaccompanied girl, the FBI said in a statement. Flight attendants offered to move Camp to another seat where he would have more room, but he declined. \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine,\u201d he said, according to a criminal complaint obtained by The Washington Post..",
        "On the morning of May 17, Daniel Murphy rose in New York City as a . 400 hitter. The Washington Nationals second baseman was in town to play the Mets, his old team, and his first in his new uniform could scarcely have gone better. That night, Murphy went 1 for 3, and his batting average dropped to . 397. Indeed, in his final 14 games of May, he sizzled, hitting . 389 with four homers, knocking out at least two hits seven times. And yet, when June opened, he hadn\u2019t again reached . 400.",
        "A day after Donald Trump revoked The Washington Post\u2019s credentials to cover his campaign last week, one of the newspaper\u2019s reporters walked into his rally in Greensboro, N. C. and began reporting on it. The only difference was that the reporter, Jenna Johnson, entered on a ticket, not a press pass. She sat in the audience instead of the designated media \u201cpen\u201d and later filed a story. So much for being barred from covering Donald Trump. Johnson\u2019s experience says much about the practical impact of Trump\u2019s efforts to banish news organizations whose reporting has displeased him.",
        "Conventional wisdom says that because Donald Trump is on track to be the Republicans\u2019 presidential nominee in decades, GOP candidates should put as much distance between him and their campaigns as possible. Mary Thomas is doing the exact opposite. She\u2019s running for Florida\u2019s 2nd district, a House seat. Thomas, who worked for Florida Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s (R) administration, released two TV ads in the past week.",
        "Priorities USA Action, the leading super PAC backing presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, collected more than $12 million in May in its best fundraising month yet. The haul was driven by a handful of wealthy liberal donors and labor unions that plowed and checks into the group. The largest contribution in May came from Chicago media executive Fred Eychaner, who gave the super PAC $3 million. Eychaner had donated $2 million to the super PAC in February. Hedge fund manager Donald Sussman gave $2 million, bringing his total contribution to $3. 5 million.",
        "Iranian migrant Reda Ehsan lies on a table at the former prison of De Koepel in Haarlem, Netherlands. (Muhammed ) With declining crime rates in the Netherlands, its prisons are being underused. And with an increasing flow of migrants to Europe, the prisons are now being refashioned as temporary housing for asylum seekers, and they don\u2019t seem to mind it. It helps that most of the 12 former prisons that are being used have undergone enough transformation that they don\u2019t really seem like prisons anymore, save for some residual effects like thick cell doors and bars on the windows.",
        "As top Republicans expressed astonishment and alarm over Donald Trump\u2019s paltry campaign fundraising totals, the presumptive nominee blamed party leaders Tuesday and threatened to rely on his personal fortune instead of helping the GOP seek the cash it needs. New campaign finance reports showing that Trump had less than $1. 3 million in the bank heading into June ignited fears that the party will not be able to afford the kind of national field effort that the entire Republican ticket depends on.",
        "Donald Trump won a standing ovation from hundreds of Christian conservatives who came to New York City on Tuesday with a somewhat skeptical but willing attitude toward a man who has divided their group with comments on women, immigrants and Islam. In his comments, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee said he would end the ban on groups\u2019 \u2014 including churches \u2014 politicking, called religious liberty \u201cthe No. 1 question,\u201d and promised to appoint antiabortion Supreme Court justices.",
        "The No. 1 trending question related to Donald Trump on Google right now is \u201dWho tried to shoot Trump?\u201d Which means a lot of people don\u2019t know the answer. Which is probably because the assassination attempt on the presumptive Republican presidential nominee hasn\u2019t been covered as a major news story. View the questions on Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the past day https: . pic. twitter. \u2014 GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) June 21, 2016 The answer, authorities say, is Michael Steven Sandford, a British citizen who was in the United States illegally after overstaying his visa.",
        "For Zach Lester, of Tree and Leaf Farm in Unionville, Va. farmers markets have traditionally been a gathering of the tribe as much as a collection of freshly harvested fruits and vegetables. They\u2019ve been a place where true believers could make their weekly investment in the future of local and sustainable agriculture. But in recent years, Lester has noticed a shift in the markets, especially at the Dupont Circle FreshFarm Market, where he once could expect to generate $200, 000 or more a year in gross sales.",
        "ORLANDO \u2014 After an initial burst of fire between Omar Mateen and a security guard at the Pulse nightclub, a group of five or six police officers arrived on the scene within minutes, broke through a large glass window and entered the club as the killing of 49 people was underway inside, according to a Belle Isle, Fla. police officer who was among the first responders. Officer Brandon Cornwell, 25, said the team spent the first seconds in the dimly lit club \u201ctrying to locate exactly where the shooter was \u2014 we kept hearing people scream and shots fired.",
        "I didn\u2019t wake up Monday morning intending for this to be \u201cThe Trump Campaign Is a Rolling Dumpster Fire Week\u201d here at The Plum Line, but we follow where the news leads us. And the news for Donald Trump has transitioned from a series of stories about appalling things he has said to a series of stories about what a disaster his campaign is, at least for the moment. Today\u2019s news comes in the form of a shocking Federal Election Commission report that was released last night.",
        "When it comes to the chaotic, flailing, floundering Trump campaign, many senior Republicans are in a state of panic. Will this become a state of revolt?",
        "Mexican soccer fans may not be in the mood for celebrating much this week, after the country\u2019s historic loss to Chile on Saturday night in the Copa America quarterfinals. In happier times, though, my compatriots are known for two very different celebrations. The first one is the \u201cMexican wave. \u201d A beautiful feat of coordination, the wave was first put on display during the 1986 World Cup finals in Mexico City.",
        "It has become as routine as inclement weather: Another horrible mass killing happens in our country and Congress does nothing. It doesn\u2019t even simply do nothing. It actively votes down even the most modest efforts to save at least a few lives and to make killing a little less likely the next time around. Another day, another dead gun control measure. And the media treats the event accordingly. This struck me today when I looked at my morning newspapers.",
        "LONDON \u2014 British Prime Minister David Cameron was only minutes into a final push to persuade his country to stay in the European Union this week when he invoked the : experts. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the \u2018remain\u2019 side,\u201d he said, rattling off warnings of a cataclysm to come if Britain votes to leave. \u201cYou\u2019ve got expert after expert: the OECD, the IMF, the Bank of England, the Institute for Fiscal Studies. \u201d His audience of interrogators on the BBC\u2019s vaunted \u201cQuestion Time\u201d program was unmoved.",
        "A new study predicts that the federal forecast of national health care spending under President Obama\u2019s signature health law was a big overestimate \u2014 by $2. 6 trillion over a period. Expanding health insurance coverage to millions of Americans was bound to increase overall spending. After the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, the actuaries for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projected that, as the economy recovered, the historically low growth in health spending would return to higher levels, reaching $4. 6 trillion by 2019.",
        "Shortly after supporters of the Islamic State gunned down 14 people in California last year, the CIA\u2019s deputy director assembled a group of Muslim employees to talk about Islamophobia. The Dec. 2 shootings by Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik had illustrated the United States\u2019 vulnerability to terrorist attacks inspired by the Islamic State and ignited a heated debate over the role of Muslims here. Presidential contender Donald Trump\u2019s subsequent call to ban Muslims from entering the country had offended many Americans but resonated with others. In a conference room at the CIA\u2019s fortresslike Virginia headquarters, the agency\u2019s No.",
        "Facing pressure from the U. S. Department of Education, a South Carolina school district has agreed to allow a transgender student to use the bathroom of her choice and will revise its policies to bar discrimination based on gender identity. The department\u2019s Office of Civil Rights found that Dorchester County School District Two, located outside of Charleston, violated the rights of the transgender student \u2014 who was born male and now identifies as a girl \u2014 when it barred her from using the girls\u2019 bathroom.",
        "Compared with many other wealthy countries, the United States relies a lot on charity. In the U. S. private donors help feed and house the poor, finance orchestras and museums, fund scholarships and universities \u2014 social functions that, in many countries, are paid for by governments and tax dollars. In return, the U. S. government offers generous tax breaks on the income that Americans donate to charity. But some experts believe that changes in the financial industry are putting this longtime relationship at risk.",
        "COLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 Republican Donald Trump has swindled investors while stiffing and stepping on employees, contractors and others throughout a business career that should disqualify him as president, Democratic rival Hillary Clinton charged Tuesday. Exactly the thing that Trump claims is his main qualification \u2014 his business background \u2014 is proof of values and practices that should trouble voters, Clinton said. Her speech blended criticism of Trump\u2019s stated positions on the economy with warnings that the mogul is a big talker who has always been out for only himself. \u201cThis is his one move,\u201d Clinton said.",
        "Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, raised just $5. 4 million in May, including $2. 2 million that he loaned his campaign. Almost as startling was how little Trump had in the bank when June began: less than $1. 3 million. Where did it go? The real estate mogul does not have much of a ground operation yet or a significant paid media effort. But he managed to shell out $6. 7 million last month, including more than $1 million in payments to Trump companies or to reimburse his family for travel expenses.",
        "Hillary Clinton delivered a speech savaging Donald Trump\u2019s business acumen and economic plans in Ohio on Tuesday. It was just the sort of address we\u2019ve come to expect from Clinton during her two presidential bids: deeply researched, well argued and strongly delivered. It also had one other thing that has become a much more disturbing pattern for Clinton the candidate: a total lack of real interaction with the media who cover her. In fact, today marks 200 days since Clinton has held a formal press conference of any sort. 200!",
        "The jaguar was trotted out during an Olympic torch event in Brazil, where the official team mascot is named Ginga, a smiling, yellow jaguar. But the appearance at a zoo attached to a Manaus military compound did not end well for the jaguar: A soldier shot the animal after it escaped from its handlers, according to a Brazilian army statement. The jaguar was first tranquilized and then approached a soldier, after which it was shot, the Amazon Military Command said.",
        "Rates of marijuana use among Colorado\u2019s teenagers are essentially unchanged in the years since the state\u2019s voters legalized marijuana in 2012, new survey data from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment shows. In 2015, 21 percent of Colorado youths had used marijuana in the past 30 days. That rate is slightly lower than the national average and down slightly from the 25 percent who used marijuana in 2009, before legalization. The survey was based on a random sample of 17, 000 middle and high school students in Colorado.",
        "Stephen Rose is an economist who writes often about income inequality and the size of the middle class, and as all good researchers do, he began his latest project with a question. Why, he wondered, does advertise on television? It was a simple way of asking why luxury brands focus resources on appealing to a mass audience of U. S. consumers, particularly at a time when technology is making it easier to the very rich.",
        "BALMEDIE, Scotland \u2014 When Donald Trump arrives this weekend at the golf course he built on the rugged dunes of this remote, windswept corner overlooking the North Sea, he will celebrate it as an example of his international business success. He bought the property north of Aberdeen more than a decade ago as his first European project \u2014 a chance to establish the Trump brand in his mother\u2019s native country. He has pointed to it as a precursor to his bid for the U. S. presidency.",
        "NEW YORK \u2014 On the 26th floor of Trump Tower in Manhattan, Secret Service agents stand guard at the elevator to keep all but a handful of people away from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. But on this spring afternoon, Trump\u2019s Jared Kushner, breezes right through to Trump\u2019s corner office, not long after his oldest son just left. \u201cHi, Jared. Are you all set with the meetings?\u201d Trump said to Kushner, a stack of papers in his hand.",
        "Sen. Marco Rubio said Wednesday he will seek reelection to the Senate, reversing a pledge he made a year ago to either assume the presidency or return to private life in Florida. The decision instantly transforms an already competitive race and improves Republicans\u2019 chances of maintaining the Senate majority. Rubio ( .) issued a lengthy statement explaining his decision to reverse course, citing the Senate\u2019s power to \u201cact as a check and balance on the excesses of a president\u201d as a central reason. \u201cControl of the Senate may very well come down to the race in Florida,\u201d he said.",
        "Democrats took over the House floor on Wednesday in an attempt to force votes on proposals, preventing Republican leaders from conducting the business of the day. Chanting \u201cNo bill, no vote,\u201d the group of House Democrats shouted down Republican leaders\u2019 efforts to gavel the House into session and begin conducting the day\u2019s legislative agenda following the opening prayer and the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. Democrats, who gathered in the well of the chamber, began their around 11:30 a. m. with members coming in and out to lend their support."
