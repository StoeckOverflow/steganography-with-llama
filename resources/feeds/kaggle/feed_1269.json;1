        "IHAVE a habit that horrifies most people. I watch television and films in fast forward. This has become increasingly easy to do with computers (I\u2019ll show you how) and the time savings are enormous. Four episodes of \u201dUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d fit into an hour. An entire season of \u201dGame of Thrones\u201d goes down on the bus ride from D. C. to New York. I started doing this years ago to make my life more efficient. Between trendy Web shows, auteur cable series, and BBC imports, there\u2019s more to watch ever before.",

For years, the have been trying to prove that Hillary Clinton gave \u201c \u201d orders blocking the military from helping ambassador Chris Stevens and other U. S. personnel in Benghazi the night of the 2012 attacks. But Donald Trump asserts the opposite: Clinton was unconscious. Stevens \u201cwas left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed,\u201d the presumptive Republican presidential nominee declared Wednesday in an unfocused jeremiad against his Democratic opponent. \u201cThat\u2019s right.",

Political neophytes run for office; then, when the harsh reality of running a serious national campaign thoroughly punctures their cocky naivet\u00e9, they are fired. Donald Trump is already starring in the pilot. Forget, for a moment, all of Trump\u2019s epic character flaws. A new question has seized the campaign: Can the business wizard actually manage anything? His campaign\u2019s spiral into collapse proves he cannot. Let us count the ways: Basic targeting.",
        "For six years, Republicans in Congress have promised that very, very soon they\u2019d release their plan to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act. Just you wait, they said back in 2010, when we put out our plan America will see how terrific our ideas are. They also said that in 2011 \u2014 the plan was coming, hold on! They said that in 2012 \u2014 any day now, here it comes! They said that in 2013, and 2014 and 2015 \u2014 just give us a few more weeks, and you\u2019ll have it!",

        "Surveillance footage from inside an Orlando club the night of a rampage there shows Omar Mateen firing at people, stopping and then shooting again those who were already wounded, said officials who have viewed the evidence. The video suggests that \u201che was making sure anybody who was shot was dead,\u201d said one official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing. The footage corroborates witness accounts that Mateen quickly emptied a magazine and then reloaded, proceeding to fire another 30 rounds into the wounded sprawled in front of him.",
        "House Republicans are set Wednesday to unveil their plan to replace President Obama\u2019s signature health care reform law \u2014 the first such proposal in the six years since the Affordable Care Act\u2019s passage to carry the endorsement of House GOP leadership. The Republican plan would discard the mandates and penalties that have made \u201cObamacare\u201d a perennial target for GOP lawmakers, but it comes with uncertain costs and an unknown impact on the number of insured Americans.

        "For music geeks, what has unfolded in a Los Angeles courthouse over the past week has been like some epic Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony \u2014 except with everyone wearing suits, and way too many lawyers in the room.

        "LONDON \u2014 Britain careened toward a historic choice Wednesday as voters heard final pitches on both sides of a bitterly fought referendum showdown that could rock the global economy and deeply unsettle the Western political order. After months of campaigning that sharply divided the country over questions of immigration and identity, final polls showed Britons almost exactly split over whether the country should exit the European Union.

        "President Obama suffered the biggest legal defeat of his administration Thursday when a deadlocked Supreme Court failed to revive his stalled plan to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation and give them the right to work legally in the United States. The justices\u2019 votes were not announced, but the court\u2019s liberals and conservatives split at oral argument this spring. The tie means that a lower court\u2019s decision that Obama probably exceeded his powers in issuing the executive action keeps the plan from being implemented.",
        "A frustrated President Obama on Thursday decried the Supreme Court\u2019s decision not to lift an injunction against his signature immigration program and blamed Republicans for standing in the way of progress, as he and other Democrats vowed to turn immigration into an election litmus test. \u201dHere\u2019s the bottom line: We\u2019ve got a very real choice that America faces right now,\u201d Obama said during a hastily arranged appearance in the White House briefing room.",
        "The Supreme Court issued two major decisions Thursday that could quickly reverberate in a 2016 presidential campaign. First, the court upheld the University of Texas\u2019s limited use of affirmative action in its admissions. Then, it announced it deadlocked on President Obama\u2019s plan to exempt some undocumented immigrants from deportation and allow them to work legally. That tie meant a decision halting the program will stand. In other words: One is a substantial decision in favor of the political left on affirmative action, and the other is a major setback for the Obama administration on illegal immigration.",
        "Thursday\u2019s Supreme Court refusal to revive President Obama\u2019s immigration directive is a win for Republicans in more ways than one. But perhaps as much as anything, they\u2019ll see it as vindication of their decision to not consider Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court. First, let\u2019s note that Garland very likely would not have been the deciding vote in this particular case. Even in a perfect world for Democrats, he probably wouldn\u2019t have been on the court in time. Republicans have held up President Obama\u2019s nominee since Obama nominated the judge in March.",
        "Undocumented immigrants and their supporters reacted angrily Thursday to the U. S. Supreme Court\u2019s failure to revive deportation relief programs for nearly 4 million people, vowing to continue to fight for legal status through the November presidential elections. \u201cThis is something that we had in our hands, and they took it away,\u201d said Rosario Reyes, 38, who has brought her young son to the steps of the Supreme Court every Monday in recent weeks to await word of a ruling. On Thursday, she said, her son cried when they both learned the news.",
        "The Supreme Court on Thursday reaffirmed that the value of creating a diverse student body allows university officials to consider race in making admission decisions, upholding a University of Texas plan that has been the subject of years of legal battles. The decision was a surprising win for advocates of affirmative action, who had entered the term simply hoping the court would not use the case to ban all uses of affirmative action. Instead, the majority opinion written by Justice Anthony M.",
        "BRUSSELS \u2014 No matter what Britain decided Thursday in its momentous vote over E. U. membership, European leaders say their ambitions to build a more united continent may be on hold after the bitter campaign exposed deeper troubles within the alliance. Leaders say that a project of greater economic and political integration \u2014 first imagined in the ashes of World War II \u2014 may have finally hit its limits amid surging skepticism about how much sovereignty to surrender by allowing Brussels to take the helm.",
        "Volkswagen has agreed to pay $10. 2 billion to settle its U. S. emissions scandal case, according to the Associated Press, citing two anonymous people briefed on the matter, in what would be one of the largest payouts by an automaker in history. The case stems from the carmaker\u2019s 2015 admission that 11 million vehicles worldwide had cheating software designed to get around emissions tests. The settlement will compensate owners of 482, 000 vehicles with diesel engines that were programmed to turn off emissions measurement data outside of laboratory settings.",
        "Gun control advocates were predicting Thursday that they had significantly altered the dynamics of the national   debate, crediting recent episodes of unusual political theater on Capitol Hill. Tempering that optimism, however, was continued inaction by Congress on actual gun legislation. The House adjourned in the early hours Thursday as GOP leaders sought to   a remarkable   protest by Democrats. Hours later, the Senate stalled on a bipartisan compromise proposal to keep guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists. But   supporters believe they have turned a corner toward building greater public support for their cause.",
        "There\u2019s nothing new about protest demonstrations on the House floor. Often they are led by the minority party feeling aggrieved over the majority\u2019s authoritarian tactics. But this week\u2019s Democratic seizure of the House floor, for more than 26 hours, in pursuit of at least two votes on gun legislation in the wake of this month\u2019s Orlando massacre, achieved an entirely different level.",
        "\u201cI believe in an America always moving toward the future. \u201d \u2014 Hillary Clinton, June 21 This was not the most important line in Clinton\u2019s Ohio economic policy speech, only the most amazing. Surely there cannot be a more vacuous, meaningless piece of political rhetoric. Every terrestrial entity from nematode to the United States of America moves forward into the future quite on its own, thank you. Where else is there to go? To be fair, however, spouting emptiness is tempting when you have the impossible task of running as the de facto incumbent in a ragingly \u201cchange\u201d year.",
        "Jon O. Newman is a senior judge on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The acquittal Thursday of another Baltimore police officer charged in the death of Freddie Gray, like the acquittal 25 years ago of the Los Angeles officers who beat Rodney King, reveals the inadequacy of the remedy. Suing the police for money under a strengthened federal civil rights law would be a better response to police misconduct.",
        "Seth Moulton, a Democrat, represents Massachusetts\u2019s 6th congressional district in the House. Losing a friend in war is always hard. Losing a friend to a battle we already fought and won is worse. That\u2019s how my close friend Lt. Col. Ehab Hashem Moshen was killed recently by the Islamic State near Fallujah \u2014 refighting a battle in Iraq that the Marine Corps fought a decade ago. The Marines won that fight. The problem is that the Obama administration didn\u2019t follow through on a political plan to maintain the peace."
