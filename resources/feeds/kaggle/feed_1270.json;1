        "Oh, God \u2014 and I mean the entreaty seriously \u2014 the summit in New York was just as bad as some of us feared. More than 900 conservative Christian leaders, put in a susceptible mood by a \u201cprayer guide\u201d (\u201cAcknowledge any personal feelings that would keep you from honoring Mr. Trump for his participation\u201d) witnessed Donald Trump field some softball questions. This was reassuring enough to reward him with a standing ovation and positive buzz. Trump can now (accurately) assume that these clerics and activists won\u2019t be giving him much more trouble.",
        "RALEIGH, N. C. Suddenly, after months of schoolyard taunts and sloganeering, everyone wants to wear the mantle of substance. Donald Trump would much rather run an election \u201cbased on issues and policy\u201d rather than personal attacks, he told ABC News on the very day his campaign launched lyingcrookedhillary. com. \u201cI think we win on issues and policy,\u201d he said. The next day, here in Raleigh, Hillary Clinton tried to exhibit her own commitment to issues and policy.",
        "ON ONE level, it\u2019s unsurprising that the Supreme Court deadlocked 4 to 4, after an appeals court split 2 to 1, in considering President Obama\u2019s sweeping executive action to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation. As a legal matter, this was not an easy call. What makes the outcome so depressing for the country, and such a for failed governance, is that as a policy matter, it shouldn\u2019t be hard at all. Immigrants have been and continue to be, on balance, an overwhelmingly positive force for the nation\u2019s social and economic health.",
        "BALTIMORE \u2014 A judge on Thursday found the sole officer charged with murder in the death of Freddie Gray not guilty of all counts, leaving prosecutors without a conviction for the third time in the case that spurred riots and unrest in the city last year. The verdict in the trial of Caesar Goodson Jr. is the second acquittal handed down by Baltimore Circuit Court Judge Barry G. Williams in the case. The judge last month acquitted the second officer who went to trial in Gray\u2019s death. The first officer\u2019s trial ended in a hung jury.",
        "Walter E. Fauntroy, the former District delegate to Congress and civil rights legend who left Washington in 2012 for the Persian Gulf \u2014 leaving his aging wife in debt and eluding a criminal charge in Maryland \u2014 vowed in his first interview in four years that he is coming home next week. \u201cI have my ticket. I have my passport. Without question, it\u2019s over,\u201d Fauntroy said in a phone call with The Washington Post from the United Arab Emirates. \u201cI\u2019m coming home.",
        "We\u2019re getting a good idea about who is going to suit up for Team USA this summer at the Rio Olympics men\u2019s basketball competition, with names trickling out ahead of Monday\u2019s final roster announcement. LeBron James will not be among those who do ultimately make the final roster, the superstar confirmed Thursday. James told Cleveland. com that he would forgo these Olympics in order to rest after his sixth straight trip to the NBA Finals. \u201cI could use the rest,\u201d James said. He contacted Mike Krzyzewski on Thursday to inform Team USA\u2019s head coach of his decision.",
        "Here s something that gets proved so aggressively each day of our digital lives, it might actually be true: Artists do not decide the meaning of their work. That privilege belongs to the public. It is how art gains social value in a democracy, and it s why having an opinion on Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9 has become one of America s most vigorous online sports.",
        "Donald Trump did something Thursday that you might not think is all that big a deal: He forgave more than $50 million in personal loans to his presidential campaign. This isn\u2019t new money Trump is donating to the campaign. It\u2019s money that has already been given \u2014 and spent. But, that misses how important \u2014 and necessary \u2014 what Trump did actually is: In forgiving the personal loans, he turned them into contributions. What that means in plain English is that he can\u2019t refund that $50 million to himself out of the campaign\u2019s coffers \u2014 now or ever.",
        "AYR, Scotland \u2014 All the rooms are booked here at the Trump Turnberry resort, along with all the nearby hotels and inns, as political reporters and local descend on this quiet, rural corner of this small country for the arrival of Donald Trump. On Friday, police and antiterrorism agents plan to surround this resort on Scotland\u2019s rugged west coast, where Trump plans to arrive by helicopter with his family and U. S. Secret Service agents, take questions from reporters and cut a ribbon.",
        "Republican Donald Trump gave a speech on June 22 attacking Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, in speeches by the two presumptive presidential nominees aimed at undermining each other\u2019s credentials. A large portion of his speech criticized Clinton\u2019s record as secretary of state and donations given to the Clinton Foundation, as outlined in Peter Schweizer\u2019s book, \u201cClinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.",
        "There will be no new names added to the writing credits of one of the most famous rock songs in history: On Thursday, a Los Angeles jury found that Led Zeppelin did not plagiarize the opening chords of its defining song, \u201cStairway to Heaven,\u201d despite allegations leveled by the psychedelic rock band Spirit. The verdict ended a copyright infringement trial that captivated music fans, and journalists alike, as a trio of rock heroes sang, chuckled and waxed nostalgic in several days of decidedly entertaining testimony.",
        "It\u2019s widely known that income inequality has grown rapidly in recent decades. As it stands in the United States, an average member of the top 1 percent of earners makes 25 times as much money as an average member of the other 99 percent. But this is just a national figure; across the country, the ratio ranges from 5 all the way up to 233. What might be more surprising is precisely where income inequality hits those peaks. Yes, a lot of inequality is where you\u2019d expect it: in big cities along the coasts.",
        "The global economy faces months \u201d if not years \u201d of slower growth as Britain s stunning decision to abandon the European Union threw financial markets into a tailspin and darkened the outlook for corporate and consumer spending. Though the damage is likely to be concentrated on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, experts said the repercussions would ripple across the world and into the United States. The domino effect was on full display Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted more than 600\u00c2 points in one of the most harrowing days of trading this year.",
        "TURNBERRY, Scotland \u2014 Arriving here Friday for his first trip abroad as the likely Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump did not seem to understand the gravity of the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the European Union. As the value of the pound collapsed in the morning and stock markets around the globe plummeted, Trump attended a surreal at his luxury golf resort in this seacoast village and barely mentioned the global news until reporters pressed him to do so.",
        "LONDON \u2014 If anyone still needed a reminder that the phrase \u201cit can\u2019t happen here\u201d should be struck from the lexicon of 2016, Britain\u2019s historic Brexit referendum provided one more dramatic piece of evidence. The question is how Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and their allies interpret the results of what did happen here. The decision by British voters to take a leap into the unknown by severing ties with the European Union is by no means a reliable predictor of the eventual outcome of the presidential election in the United States.",
        "The whole world is reeling after a milestone referendum in Britain to leave the European Union. And although leaders of the campaign to exit Europe are crowing over their victory, it seems many Britons may not even know what they had actually voted for. Awakening to a stock market plunge and a precipitous decline in the value of the pound that Britain hasn\u2019t seen in more than 30 years, voters now face a series of economic shocks that analysts say will only worsen before they improve.",
        "Global stock markets plunged to their lowest levels in months Friday after Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, making an immediate dent in Americans\u2019 401( k) accounts and sparking concerns about other financial impacts for the average U. S. consumer. In the the ripple effects of the Brexit may be felt beyond retirement accounts in the form of lower mortgage rates and a stronger dollar that boosts Americans\u2019 purchasing power.",
        "Today has been a day of bitterness, resentment and betrayal for British millennials like me. Overnight, my generation has lost the right to call ourselves Europeans, as well as the right to live, love and work in the 27 other countries of the European Union. Among the many divisions the referendum has revealed in the U. K. the chasm between generations is becoming the most pronounced. While the Leave campaign achieved a victory in the referendum, 75 percent of voters between 18 and 24 wanted to remain.",
        "Henry M. Paulson Jr. is chairman of the Paulson Institute and a former U. S. treasury secretary and chief executive of Goldman Sachs. Republicans stand at a crossroads. With Donald Trump as the presumptive presidential nominee, we are witnessing a populist hijacking of one of the United States\u2019 great political parties. The GOP, in putting Trump at the top of the ticket, is endorsing a brand of populism rooted in ignorance, prejudice, fear and isolationism. This troubles me deeply as a Republican, but it troubles me even more as an American. Enough is enough.",
        "Like everybody else in London, I woke up this morning, after not much sleep, to graphic depictions of the pound crashing, the stock exchange collapsing and markets all over the world in turmoil. I have no doubt that tomorrow or the next day, the story will be different. Traders will take a step back and notice that nothing, actually, has happened yet. There will be cheap assets to pick up. Markets will stabilize. The true impact of Brexit, on Britain and on Europe, will not be visible for many years.",
        "With Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, did Donald Trump just win the presidential election? On the surface, this may seem an odd question, but the concerns that led a majority of Brits to vote \u201cleave\u201d on Thursday are similar to those that have catapulted Trump to the Republican nomination \u2014 immigration, refugees, underemployment. Also similar have been reactions to Brexit and to Trump\u2019s political rise. Analysts and market speculators were shocked that the prediction models they used were wrong. Overnight, the political playbook seemed to have become a relic of some distant past.",
        "\u201cWe don\u2019t know anything about Hillary in terms of religion,\u201d said Donald Trump, while speaking to a group of Christian leaders in New York. \u201cNow, she\u2019s been in the public eye for years and years, and yet there\u2019s no \u2014 there\u2019s nothing out there. \u201d Trump, of course, is dead wrong about that, just as he is about so many other things on which he opines. There\u2019s plenty \u201cout there\u201d about Hillary Clinton\u2019s faith.",
        "WHAT NOW for Europe? After Britain\u2019s vote to exit the European Union, European leaders will be tempted to keep the rest of the E. U. together by making an example of the continent\u2019s economy. In fact, insisting that Britain\u2019s exit be unnecessarily difficult would lead to more economic pain for all. Start by remembering why a generation of leaders built organizations such as the E. U. have come together in international institutions to make their conduct regular and predictable, which promotes the free flow of goods, money, people and ideas and the that follows.",
        "It started as a routine hearing in a Georgia courtroom. It ended as an extraordinary display of vulgarity \u2014 between a defendant and judge. Denver Fenton Allen, the defendant in a murder case, repeatedly threatened a judge and hurled crude obscenities and aggressive remarks during a hearing, the Atlanta reported. Allen was appearing before Bryant Durham Jr. a superior court judge in Floyd County. The hearing, held in Rome, Ga. last week, lasted less than 20 minutes.",
        "As storms have swept West Virginia, roads have turned into rivers, cars have been swallowed whole and at least 23 people have been killed \u2014 including a preschooler who fell into floodwaters that carried him away. Officials said at least 23 had died in the destructive and deadly thunderstorms that have swept the state, according to the Associated Press. Of those, at least 15 had been killed in Greenbrier County, according to the state\u2019s division of Homeland Security.",
        "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 One evening in March, a group of tech industry elite sat around a table in the private dining room of a restaurant in San Francisco, listening to a talk about how to do their jobs. The people assembled wielded about as much power as anyone in Silicon Valley, but they weren\u2019t the likes of Sheryl Sandberg, Marissa Mayer or Elon Musk. Instead, the evening marked the quarterly gathering for Silicon Valley chiefs of staff \u2014 an group whose members are the men and women to tech\u2019s biggest power players.",
        "Michael Herr, a Vietnam War reporter whose \u201cDispatches\u201d remains one of the most powerful books about the ravages of combat and who later contributed to the screenplays of such bleak films as \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d and \u201cFull Metal Jacket,\u201d died June 23 near his home in Upstate New York. He was 76. His daughter Claudia Herr confirmed the death but declined to provide further details. He lived in Delhi, N. Y. \u201cDispatches,\u201d published in 1977, drew resounding critical praise. It was one of the first books to confront the Vietnam War in all its hallucinogenic awfulness and jarring absurdities.",
        "It was supposed to be a display of Democratic goodwill, a moment of principled agreement on shared policy objectives that would mend the rift between supporters of Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, and Bernie Sanders, the senator from Vermont who has refused to formally bow out of the race. Instead, the final meeting of the committee drafting the Democratic Party platform, while featuring consensus on several items, revealed deep disagreement over others, including loyalty to President Obama and his pursuit of the Partnership.",
        "It is not often that foreign publications wade into the thicket of an American presidential election and accuse a candidate of misogyny and hate speech. It is even rarer for a foreign fashion magazine to do so. But for its July issue, the of the Mexican and Latin American edition of Marie Claire has climbed atop her glossy soap box with a cover story directed at Ivanka Trump \u2014 and, obliquely, her father, the presumptive Republican nominee. In bold cover type, the magazine pleads: \u201cDear Ivanka.",
        "Donald Trump\u2019s supporters were invigorated Friday by the shocking news that British voters opted to leave the European Union. They even called on American voters to follow Britain\u2019s lead and elect Trump \u2014 who has said \u201cAmerica First\u201d will be the \u201cmajor, overriding theme of my administration\u201d \u2014 as their president in November. \u201cThe failed European Union experiment, and Great Britain\u2019s rejection of it, must serve as a call for all of us in America,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Sessions ( .) the first senator to endorse Trump. \u201cI believe the American people too will choose independence this November."
