        "Elites are in trouble. High levels of immigration are destabilizing our democracies. Politicians who put their political interests over their countries needs reap the whirlwind \u201d for themselves but, more importantly, for their nations. Citizens who live in the economically ailing peripheries of wealthy nations are in revolt against and cosmopolitan metropolitan areas. Older voters lock in decisions that young voters reject. Traditional political parties on the left and right are being torn asunder.",
        "When Vladimir Putin worked in Dresden, he watched helplessly as Soviet ally East Germany slipped out of Moscow\u2019s orbit, united with West Germany, and joined the democratic side of Europe. multilateral institutions in Europe \u2014 the Warsaw Pact and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon) the Soviet command economy trade organization \u2014 also disappeared. Putin then witnessed the dissolution of the Soviet Union, an event that he later described as one of the greatest tragedies of the 20th century.",
        "IT HAS been more than six years since the Affordable Care Act passed and nearly three years since its major provisions began phasing in. During that time, the rate of uninsured Americans has plummeted to a historic low. Also during that time, Republicans have blamed the law for practically every problem with the system, the economy and more. But they have infamously not united behind a credible alternative. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) seemed to promise better when he announced that he would roll out an ambitious policy agenda this summer.",
        "EVERY YEAR, college students shell out thousands of dollars for tuition. Then they face an additional cost: textbooks. Students spend as much as $1, 300 over their college careers on books alone \u2014 a burden that falls most heavily on those who have to take out loans to pay. A pilot program from a community college reform group just outside Washington, D. C. could help. Education advocacy group Achieving the Dream this month announced $9. 8 million in grants for developing degree programs that use online, materials instead of pricey printed books.",
        "For decades, visitors to Independence Hall in Philadelphia were told one main story: This was where the country\u2019s Founding Fathers enshrined Americans\u2019 inalienable rights in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. But now, an additional human rights story is being told at the symbolic birthplace of the United States: that of Reminder Days, one of the earliest public protests against LGBT discrimination. Tour guides talk about the primly dressed demonstrators who marched past the Liberty Bell on July 4 for five years in the 1960s, reminding the public that gay people lacked basic rights.",
        "SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2014 Authorities were anticipating violence as a white nationalist group planned a demonstration at the California Capitol, and they brought in more than 100 officers to patrol the grounds. But after 10 people were hurt Sunday, they faced criticism Monday about whether they were properly prepared or too slow to get involved when the demonstration quickly turned violent in a clash with a larger group of . \u201cIt was basically a \u201d said Cres Vellucci, an observer with the National Lawyers Guild. \u201cI was just appalled that nothing seemed to be done.",
        "If Hillary Clinton had to pick her running mate today, I think she d pick Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia. Here s why. The defining trait of Clinton s political career is caution. She doesn t ever leap before she looks \u201d and looks and looks. Part of this is a function of the fact that Clinton doesn t have great natural political instincts \u201d which she has repeatedly acknowledged during this campaign. It s also the result of being enemy No. 1 (or, at worst, No. 2) for Republicans for most of the past decades.",
        "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Hillary Clinton took aim Sunday at Washington politicians, telling a meeting of the country\u2019s mayors that they could never stay in good stead with their constituents amid the kind of inaction and paralysis that has become commonplace in the nation\u2019s capital. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, cited an inability to pass gun control legislation in the wake of the Orlando mass shooting and the Senate\u2019s refusal to take a vote on President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland.",
        "One of the questions worth asking about the rise of Donald Trump in American politics is the extent to which he took advantage of a latent frustration over immigration \u2014 or whether he\u2019s driving new hostility among people who hadn\u2019t paid much attention to politics in the past. In other words: Was someone preaching Trump\u2019s isolationist message naturally going to do well, or have those themes risen to prominence because of Trump? This is surprisingly hard to suss out.",
        "PANAMA CITY \u2014 A mammoth ship bearing 9, 472 containers and the unwieldy name Cosco Shipping Panama completed on Sunday the first official voyage through the new expanded Panama Canal, a $5. 25 billion project designed to modernize a landmark of human ambition, determination and engineering prowess. The Chinese vessel, which set sail from the Greek port of Piraeus on June 11, began its crossing of the isthmus from the northern Atlantic Ocean end of the canal.",
        "Pat Summitt, the legendary University of Tennessee women\u2019s basketball head coach who led the Volunteers to eight national championships in 38 years, has experienced a decline in health recently, according to a statement released by her family Sunday morning. Summit, 64, was diagnosed with early onset dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s type in August 2011. She stepped down from her position in April 2012 and was named head coach emeritus. Summitt\u2019s 1, 098 career wins are the most by any NCAA men\u2019s or women\u2019s basketball coach.",
        "He was a rapper trying to stop violence in Baltimore. Tyriece Travon Watson, better known as Lor Scoota, had just finished hosting a charity basketball game. The fliers advertising the event had said, \u201cPray for peace in these streets. \u201d Music artists and important faces from around the city had come together to prove they could get along. Lor Scoota got in his car and left the arena. Bringing peace to Baltimore was a message he had been trying to spread \u2014 on panels, in classrooms and in his music.",
        "Billy Hurley III barely celebrated after his final par putt fell into the 18th hole to win the Quicken Loans National at Congressional Country Club on Sunday. Perhaps, if he had let himself go, he had no idea what he would do. Few men have won a golf tournament \u2014 or any sports event \u2014 that wove together more powerful personal emotions, more conquering of and more vindication of a family. He did nothing because he felt so much.",
        "Everyone knows Bud can talk like the parrot that he is. The question \u2014 for one prosecutor, at least \u2014 is whether the bird, which may have witnessed a brutal killing, should be allowed to sing like a canary. Only weeks ago, the idea seemed like an absurd plot twist in a bad Jim Carrey flick from the \u201990s. But this week, Newaygo County Prosecuting Attorney Robert Springstead told the Detroit Free Press that authorities are studying the parrot\u2019s words to determine whether the bird\u2019s speech can be considered admissible evidence in a court of law.",
        "The Supreme Court on Monday ruled resoundingly for abortion rights advocates in the court\u2019s most important decision on the controversial issue in 25 years, striking down restrictions in Texas that are similar to those enacted across the country. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy joined the court\u2019s liberals in the decision, which said Texas\u2019s argument that the restrictions were meant to protect women\u2019s health was merely cover for making abortions harder to obtain. The Texas provisions required doctors who perform abortions at clinics to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital and ordered clinics to meet standards of surgical centers.",
        "The Supreme Court unanimously overturned former Virginia governor Robert F. McDonnell\u2019s conviction Monday and imposed higher standards for federal prosecutors who charge public officials with wrongdoing. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. described the former governor\u2019s actions as \u201ctawdry\u201d but agreed that instructions to the jury in his case about what constitutes \u201cofficial acts\u201d were so broad, they could cover almost any action a public official takes. McDonnell\u2019s promising political career was derailed by his entanglement with a businessman who showered the governor and his family with luxury gifts and financial benefits.",
        "The Supreme Court said Monday that people convicted of domestic abuse can be prevented from owning a gun, in a case that prompted the first questions from Justice Clarence Thomas in 10 years. In a decision, the court said Congress had intended to keep firearms out of the hands of domestic abusers. The question for the court was whether the gun ban applies to those convicted under state law of misdemeanor domestic abuse and specifically whether assault convictions for \u201creckless\u201d conduct could trigger the prohibition.",
        "On Monday, the Supreme Court struck down a set of Texas restrictions that shuttered half the state\u2019s abortion providers, and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg used her concurring opinion to blast a key argument for the state\u2019s tighter regulations \u2014 that terminating a pregnancy in a clinic is dangerous. She alluded to cases similar to former physician Kermit Gosnell, a criminal named 10 times in Monday\u2019s court opinions. The Philadelphia physician was convicted of murder five years ago for killing three infants who were born alive during attempted abortions.",
        "LONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s political system remained in turmoil Monday, virtually leaderless and with the two major parties divided internally. But the meltdown that has taken place in the days after voters decided to break the country\u2019s ties with Europe is more than a British problem, reflecting an erosion in public confidence that afflicts democracies around the world. Last Thursday\u2019s Brexit vote cast a bright light on the degree to which the effects of globalization and the impact of immigration, along with decades of overpromises and by political leaders, have undermined the ability of those officials to lead.",
        "LONDON \u2014 Britain on Monday accelerated its possible date with destiny outside the European Union, bringing forward the selection of its new prime minister by a month in a move that may help assuage European demands for a more rapid withdrawal. By picking a new leader in September rather than October, the country could be free to move faster with its departure from the club.",
        "BASKING RIDGE, N. J. \u2014 Well before Columbus sailed to the New World and even before Gutenberg invented the printing press, there grew a great oak tree in a land that would one day be called New Jersey. The oak was already old when farmers built a church beside it in 1717. And when the people came and kept coming, a town called Basking Ridge was built around the church that was built beside the tree. Town and tree would always be inseparable, or so the people thought.",
        "Volkswagen will settle its emissions scandal case for $14. 7 billion, the largest payout by an automaker to consumers in U. S. history, in an agreement set to be formally announced Tuesday morning, according to two people familiar with the matter. More than $10 billion of the settlement will go to fix or buy back 475, 000 Volkswagens with diesel engines that were programmed to turn off emissions measurement data outside of laboratory settings, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the deal had not yet been announced.",
        "Rejecting Texas\u2019s latest effort to do away with abortion rights, the Supreme Court served the antiabortion movement some very bad news Monday. The justices didn\u2019t believe Texas was just trying to help its poor, hapless women out. Instead, according to Justice Stephen G. Breyer\u2019s majority opinion: \u201cIn the face of no threat to women\u2019s health, Texas seeks to force women to travel long distances to get abortions in superfacilities. \u201d From now on, the court warned, it would no longer, as the White Queen said in \u201cThrough the Looking Glass,\u201d believe \u201cas many as six impossible things before breakfast.",
        "Former Virginia governor Robert F. McDonnell won a major victory Monday at the Supreme Court, where the justices unanimously vacated a lower court\u2019s decision that found him guilty of bribery charges after he accepted more than $175, 000 in loans, gifts and other benefits from a Virginia businessman. The win doesn\u2019t necessarily end McDonnell\u2019s fight to stay out of prison, but it does make clear an important point in U. S. corruption law: A politician is corrupt only if he or she committed an \u201cofficial act\u201d in exchange for gifts.",
        "They celebrated outside the Supreme Court after Monday\u2019s surprise decision reaffirming abortion rights. They danced to Michael Jackson (\u201cI want to love you . . . \u201d) as they had earlier to the Spice Girls and to Harry Belafonte\u2019s \u201cJump in the Line. \u201d In the front row, facing the marble temple, a young woman held up a homemade sign: \u201cRoses are red Violets are blue Abortion is legal So you. \u201d Justice Anthony Kennedy didn\u2019t use those words, but that was, essentially, the valentine he delivered to the antiabortion movement.",
        "Russian intelligence and security services have been waging a campaign of harassment and intimidation against U. S. diplomats, embassy staff and their families in Moscow and several other European capitals that has rattled ambassadors and prompted Secretary of State John F. Kerry to ask Vladimir Putin to put a stop to it. At a recent meeting of U. S. ambassadors from Russia and Europe in Washington, U. S. ambassadors to several European countries complained that Russian intelligence officials were constantly perpetrating acts of harassment against their diplomatic staff that ranged from the weird to the downright scary.",
        "David Cole is a professor at Georgetown Law and author of \u201cEngines of Liberty: The Power of Citizen Activists to Make Constitutional Law. \u201d For years, the Roberts court has been, for all practical purposes, the Kennedy court. It has almost always been Anthony M. Kennedy, not Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. who has provided the decisive vote in closely divided cases \u2014 leading the court, year after year, to reach more liberal outcomes than many expected.",
        "UNDER DAVID Cameron\u2019s leadership, Britain\u2019s importance as a U. S. ally has steadily diminished. His government was slow in joining the campaign against the Islamic State and has played no significant role in resisting Russian aggression in Ukraine. Following a rebuff by Parliament, Mr. Cameron retreated from airstrikes against Syria in 2013, prompting a climbdown by President Obama that has had disastrous consequences. Mr. Cameron\u2019s most notable foreign policy initiative was his craven courtship of Chinese dictator Xi Jinping in the hope of reaping commercial advantage. Consequently, the result of Mr.",
        "FALLUJAH, Iraq \u2014 From the outside, there\u2019s not a lot that stands out about the three neighboring houses on this residential street in the Iraqi city of Fallujah. One is grander than most, with two tall columns straddling its entrance. The others are unassuming and beige, like much of this city, which had been under the control of the Islamic State for the past 2 years. But behind their front doors is a makeshift prison used by the militants to mete out their archaic punishments.",
        "Evidence collected by the House Select Committee on the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, confirms that Defense Department actions could not have saved the lives of four Americans killed, that of State Hillary Clinton was actively \u201cengaged\u201d and responsive during the attack and that no one in the Obama administration lied about what happened, according to a report issued Monday by committee Democrats. Release of the report was a preemptive strike against the Republican majority\u2019s version of the results of the investigation into the assault on a U. S."
